<text>The Morristown Line is an NJ Transit commuter rail line connecting Morris and Essex counties to New York City, via either New York Penn Station or Hoboken Terminal. Out of 60 inbound and 58 outbound daily weekday trains, 28 inbound and 26 outbound Midtown Direct trains (about 45%) use the Kearny Connection (opened June 10, 1996) to Penn Station; the rest go to Hoboken. Passengers can transfer at Newark Broad Street or Summit to reach the other destination. On rail system maps the line is colored dark green, and its symbol is a drum, a reference to Morristown&#x27;s history during the American Revolution.

There is frequent service weekdays, with hourly service to/from New York (none going beyond Dover) on weekends. Until August 13, 2006, there was also hourly service to Hoboken. On that date, service between Hoboken and Summit was cut back to once every two hours on weekends. On May 11, 2008, off-peak weekday Hoboken-Dover trains (600 Series) were cut. In addition, weekend Gladstone trains were cut back to Summit, and a shuttle train is operated every two hours between Newark Broad Street and Hoboken Terminal.

The Millburn-Summit segment underwent extensive rehabilitation in the mid-2010s. This included the replacement of the creosote crossties on both tracks with concrete crossties, the replacement of all crossties on the double trestle over Short Hills Avenue, and the replacement of several sections of rail. Work has also progressed on rehabilitating both tracks between Summit and Dover with concrete crossties and new welded rail, and rehabilitation of select road overpasses.

Hurricane Sandy inflicted considerable damage on the Morristown Line on October 29–30, 2012, as fallen trees brought down catenary and signal wires and washed out sections of track, most notably through the New Jersey Meadowlands on both the main line and the Kearny Connection. Midtown Direct service was restored from Dover to New York on November 12, 2012; service to Hoboken and west of Dover resumed on November 19.

==Description==

The Morristown Line begins at Hoboken Terminal or at New York Penn Station. Trains departing for points west of Dover require diesel locomotives. Immediately after leaving Hoboken, the route passes the coach and diesel yards before entering the 1908 Bergen Tunnels under the New Jersey Palisades just past the East End interlocking. At the west portal of the Bergen Tunnel is West End interlocking, where the Main Line, Bergen County Line and Pascack Valley Line branch off to the north. The Morristown Line then crosses over Lower Hack Lift, a vertical lift bridge built in 1927 over the Hackensack River. The line crosses under Route 7 and then passes NJ Transit&#x27;s Meadowlands Maintenance Complex (MMC).

Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and the New Jersey Turnpike cross overhead. The Midtown Direct trains join the Morristown line from New York at Kearny Jct. just past this overpass. The Morristown Line parallels the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and PATH lines and Interstate 280 (I-280) for a short distance here. The Waterfront Connection is just prior to the overpass at Meadows interlocking. It allows selected North Jersey Coast Line and Raritan Valley Line trains to reach Hoboken from the Northeast Corridor Line.

The line begins its journey by following I-280 and crosses a two-track swing bridge over the Passaic River. It enters the newly renovated Newark Broad Street station, which features two high platforms serving all three tracks. Within the city limits of Newark, the line runs in a trench, passing beneath numerous streets, I-280, and the Newark City Subway. At the site of the former Roseville Avenue station, now known as the Roseville interlocking, the Montclair-Boonton Line diverges to the right. The section of the track extending westward from the Passaic River to just east of Millburn station is composed of triple tracks, while the remainder of the route to Lake Hopatcong station is a double-track railway.

After passing the abandoned station at Grove Street, now the location of Green interlocking, the line crosses the Garden State Parkway and reaches East Orange, which is situated on a viaduct. Subsequent elevated stations include Brick Church and Orange. The line then curves southward over Interstate 280, passing past Highland Avenue and Mountain Station. The next station is South Orange, an elevated structure with two platforms and three tracks, near Seton Hall University. Maplewood follows, with a side platform and a center platform serving all westbound and some eastbound trains. Beyond Maplewood, the line narrows to two tracks at Millburn interlocking. Millburn and Short Hills stations each have two side platforms serving two tracks.

Summit, a major node along the line, features two high platforms with the station building located above the tracks and a glass crossover above the platforms. Some weekday local services terminate and originate here. Many private schools are located in Summit, making commuting high school students a major source of traffic for this station. Schedules are timed for most Morristown trains to facilitate a convenient transfer to a Gladstone branch train across the platform.

West of Summit, the Gladstone Branch diverges, and the line crosses the Passaic River for the second time as it enters into Chatham Township. Chatham station is situated on an embankment with two side platforms, while Madison station, on a viaduct, features a recently refurbished 1916 station house on the eastbound side.

The line encounters its first grade crossing at Convent station, located near Saint Elizabeth University. This station has two side platforms, with the main station building on the eastbound side and a brick waiting house on the westbound track. An old freight station is situated on the eastbound side, and two additional grade crossings follow this station.

Upon crossing I-287, the line enters Morristown. The Morristown station has two low side platforms and a large station building that remains open throughout the week. The station is a focal point of a new transit-oriented development, featuring ADA-compliant mini-high platform ramps at both ends. An abandoned freight station is located at the west end. West of the station, the Morristown &amp; Erie Railway&#x27;s main offices are located, and its main line diverges at this point.

The next station is Morris Plains, featuring a 1915 brick station structure. A local model railroad club occupies the freight house just north of the station. Beyond Morris Plains, the line curves through wooded areas, passing beneath Route 10, and several crossings before reaching Mount Tabor station, a small stop in Denville Township near the community of the same name in Parsippany. This station is served by select weekday and limited weekend services and lacks an eastbound platform.

Denville station lies a short distance from Mount Tabor, where the Morristown Line converges with the Montclair-Boonton Line shortly after this station.

The line proceeds over Estling Lake and alongside the Rockaway River, entering Dover. Dover station, the terminal stop within the electrified section, features a 1905 station that was recently renovated in the mid-1990s with a single high platform. Due to the cessation of electric traction infrastructure near this location, most NJ Transit services terminate here. As of 2022, all Midtown Direct Morristown Line services are exclusively electric, although future acquisitions of dual-mode locomotives by NJ Transit could alter this service configuration. Most Hoboken services on the Morristown Line are also electric, offering superior efficiency and performance, with only a few diesel-powered Hoboken services extending westward to Hackettstown. The Morristown Line&#x27;s catenary wires end approximately half a mile west of Dover station near the U.S. Route 46 (US 46) overpass. There are unfunded plans to extend electric service to Lake Hopatcong, as the Dover Yard is at capacity and Wharton&#x27;s substation has been operational since 1984.
Continuing westward, two tracks extend over the Rockaway River, passing D&amp;R Junction in Wharton, where the Dover-Rockaway Branch of Morris County diverges. Chester Junction, located on the left, provides a connection to the Chester and High Bridge Branch of Morris County. Mount Arlington park-and-ride station follows, with dual high platforms and 285 parking spaces near Exit 30 on Interstate 80 (I-80). After passing beneath I-80, Lake Hopatcong station is next. The Lackawanna Cutoff connects on the right as the train approaches Port Morris Yard, which houses the diesel fleet serving both the Montclair-Boonton and Morristown lines. Netcong station has a brick station building on the low platform and served as the line&#x27;s endpoint until late 1994. Crossing beneath I-80 again, the line enters the Mount Olive International Trade Center, where a station is positioned at Waterloo Valley Road.

The route traverses Allamuchy Mountain State Park and runs along the Musconetcong River en route to Hackettstown. A freight spur serving the M&amp;M/Mars is located on the right before the line crosses US 46 in downtown. Hackettstown station is located shortly thereafter, featuring a single low platform with a mini-high ADA ramp. The track beyond Hackettstown falls under the ownership of Norfolk Southern Railway and is operated by the Dover &amp; Delaware River Railroad as part of the Washington Secondary extending to Phillipsburg.

Historically, the Morristown Line constituted the main line of the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad. Until 1970, passenger services extended beyond Lake Hopatcong, reaching the Pocono Mountains, Scranton, Pennsylvania, Binghamton, New York, and Buffalo, New York, via the Lackawanna Cut-Off. Service along the Cut-Off to Andover is anticipated to recommence post-2025, with the completion of the first phase of the Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project. Future plans contemplate extending rail services into northeastern Pennsylvania, potentially reaching as far as Scranton.

==Electrification==
The Morristown Line east of Dover station is electrified, using 25 kV, 60 Hz AC overhead catenary wire. The line was electrified in 1930 at 3 kV DC, but was re-electrified in 1984 at the contemporary standard of 25 kV, 60 Hz. The connecting Gladstone Branch and Montclair Branch were also re-electrified at this time.

<doc id="1291995" wikidata="Q887304" url="?curid=1291995" title="BoDeans">
<text>BoDeans is an American rock band formed in Waukesha, Wisconsin who came to prominence in the 1980s. The band&#x27;s sound encompasses multiple rock genres, including roots rock, heartland rock, and alternative rock. The band&#x27;s biggest hit to date is &quot;Closer to Free&quot;, which was used as the theme song to the hit TV series &quot;Party of Five&quot;. The band has been described as &quot;one of the most successful, and best known, bands to come out of the Milwaukee area&quot;. BoDeans is included in a permanent installation at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.

==History==
===The 1980s: Emergence and early success===

Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas met at Waukesha South High School in 1977. After discovering that they had similar music interests, they began writing songs together. Llanas entered college, but soon left after Neumann urged him to pursue music with him. At this time Neumann did not sing much, and considered himself to be primarily a drummer, while Llanas had little experience as a guitar player. However, the two decided to get serious about music and both began to sing and play guitar under the name Da BoDeans in 1980.

In April 1983, Da BoDeans began playing around Milwaukee&#x27;s East Side music scene, with a hired drummer and bass player. The band practiced in the garage of Mark McCraw, a mutual friend who soon became their manager and provided financial support during the early years. The band lost its rhythm section later that year, but continued to perform live as a duo and used the recording studio at McCraw&#x27;s university to record demos on which Llanas and Neumann played all the instruments. In 1984, drummer Guy Hoffman joined the band. The trio&#x27;s first recorded song, &quot;Sally&quot;, appeared on the first volume of the Milwaukee Sampler compilation released by Breezeway Records. To compensate for the lack of a bass player, Neumann modified his Fender Esquire with two additional pickups intended to capture solid low-end frequencies. After the trio became popular around Milwaukee, they decided to add bassist Bob Griffin in 1985.

Later in 1985, the quartet received interest from multiple major labels and chose to sign a contract with Slash/Warner Records. After signing, the label suggested that they shorten their name to simply BoDeans. Under the guidance of producer T Bone Burnett, they entered Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Sound Factory in October to record their first album. Burnett focused on capturing the band&#x27;s natural sound without many additional overdubs. The band later expressed their regret of not being able to spend more time on the production, but high studio costs kept the sessions concise. &quot;Love &amp; Hope &amp; Sex &amp; Dreams&quot;, the band&#x27;s critically acclaimed debut album, was released in 1986.

In January 1987, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reader poll voted BoDeans the Best New American Band. Early that year, they traveled to Los Angeles to work with producer Mike Campbell, but the sessions were shelved after disagreement arose over the album&#x27;s sound. Campbell wished for the album to resemble Tom Petty&#x27;s brand of 1960&#x27;s rock. The band, however, felt that this style did not fit their music and instead wanted a state-of-the-art production. They went back to Wisconsin and accepted an offer from Talking Heads member Jerry Harrison to produce their second album and were given more freedom to experiment. &quot;Outside Looking In&quot; was released in October 1987 and featured a more modern 80&#x27;s-rock sound than its roots-influenced predecessor. At the time, the band wished to break past the &quot;roots&quot; label with a state-of-the-art production, but in retrospect, they felt that the album was not able to capture the true essence of the band. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Only Love&quot;, peaked at number 16 on the US Mainstream Rock charts. In support of the album, the band toured extensively with U2 on The Joshua Tree Tour. That year, the band also contributed to Robbie Robertson&#x27;s debut solo album alongside U2 and Peter Gabriel.

In 1989, the band&#x27;s third album, titled &quot;Home&quot;, was released. It was more reminiscent of their rootsy debut, but showed a diverse range of influences including Motown, U2-inspired arena rock, and heartland rock. The songs “You Don’t Get Much” and “Red River” were used in the movie &quot;The Wizard&quot; that same year.

===The 1990s: A new direction===

In 1991, in search of a different take on their music, the band began recording with David Z (producer and sideman of Prince) at Paisley Park Studios. The band released its fourth studio album, &quot;Black and White&quot;, that year. The album&#x27;s electronic-influenced sound was a sharp departure from most of their previous efforts, with more emphasis on synthesizers, drum machines, and processed guitar tones. The album also explored darker and grander lyrical themes. Although not a single, the album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Good Things,&quot; achieved some success and became one of the band&#x27;s best-known songs. The rebellious and political &quot;Black, White, and Blood Red&quot; was the only single released from the album; it did not perform well in comparison to the band&#x27;s previous songs that made the charts.

====&quot;Closer to Free&quot; and aftermath====

After &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, the band decided to shift their focus to making the album that pleased them instead of searching for a hit. For their 1993 album &quot;Go Slow Down&quot;, the band reunited with T-Bone Burnett and took a more homemade approach, with Neumann playing many of the instruments himself. Unlike their previous album, &quot;Go Slow Down&quot; was more acoustic and marked their transition into &#x27;90s alternative rock.

The first song from the album, &quot;Closer to Free,&quot; brought Bodeans to a much larger audience after it was selected as the theme song to the television series &quot;Party of Five&quot; in 1994. (In 1999, the band would perform a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen a Face&quot; as the theme song for the show&#x27;s short-lived spinoff, &quot;Time of Your Life&quot;.) Due to the newfound exposure, &quot;Closer to Free&quot; became the group&#x27;s biggest pop hit, peaking at number 16 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1996.

In 1995, &quot;Joe Dirt Car&quot;, a two-CD live set, was released. The album included live tracks recorded between 1989 and 1995, some of which were acoustic. In 1996, the band released &quot;Blend&quot;, produced by Greg Goldman. The single &quot;Hurt By Love&quot; achieved minor chart success, while the song &quot;Hey Pretty Girl&quot; was used in an episode of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

Around this time, the band became entangled in legal battles with longtime manager Mark McCraw, who had gone on strike stating that he was entitled to partial copyright ownership of the band&#x27;s first two albums.

===The 2000s===

In 2001, the 17-song compilation &quot;The Best Of BoDeans—Slash and Burn&quot; was released on London/Slash/Rhino.

In 2003, the band was able to terminate their former management and sign with Rounder Records. The following year, the band released their seventh album, &quot;Resolution&quot;, on Rounder/Zoe. BoDeans released an album entitled &quot;Still&quot; on March 4, 2008.

===The 2010s===

The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Mr. Sad Clown&quot;, was released on April 6, 2010. Similar to their 1993 release, Neumann produced and played most of the instruments on the album in his home studio. Though critics lauded the album for its homemade approach, reviews were mixed due to the overall melancholy theme. The album features some of Neumann&#x27;s most personal songwriting.

The band released its tenth studio album, titled &quot;Indigo Dreams&quot;, on July 26, 2011.

On August 10, 2011, Llanas failed to arrive in Colorado for BoDeans performances in Denver, Boulder, and Winter Park, CO. He sent a text message to several band and crew members on August 11, 2011, notifying them of his departure from the band. On August 18, Llanas officially left the band due to &quot;differences of opinion&quot; that had been &quot;going on for years&quot;, according to Neumann. The band stated that it would continue without Llanas, with the band&#x27;s guitar technician Jake Owen filling in.

The band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, entitled &quot;American Made&quot;, was released on June 12, 2012. On March 26, the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;All The World&quot;, was released. In November 2012, the band announced the upcoming release of &quot;Amped Across America&quot;, a double live album recorded at several venues from the &quot;American Made&quot; tour.

On October 3, 2014, Neumann announced the release of the band&#x27;s 12th studio album, entitled &quot;I Cant Stop&quot;. On June 17, 2016, the band released the single &quot;My Hometown&quot; from their upcoming 13th studio album, which was entitled &quot;Thirteen&quot;. The release benefited the Milwaukee County Historical Society, which opened a BoDeans exhibit the same day. The band also released BoDeans Original Ginger Brew, a beer made by Sprecher Brewery in celebration of the 30th anniversary of their debut album. On November 11, 2016, the band released a Christmas record, “The Night Divine”. On April 21, 2017, the band released &quot;Thirteen&quot;.

===Abuse allegation===
On June 11, 2018, the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; reported that Kurt Neumann&#x27;s stepdaughter, Tessa Neumann, had accused former BoDeans member Sam Llanas of sexually abusing her from 2001 though 2007 while she was a minor. Earlier in 2018, on the band&#x27;s Facebook page, Kurt Neumann had publicly accused Llanas of molesting his stepdaughter. Llanas denied the allegations, stating that he was &quot;shocked and sickened to read about the tremendously terrible, untrue allegations of misconduct against me by the Neumanns.&quot; The band posted the June 11 article on the Bodeans Facebook page and commented as follows:

<text>Sudak (Ukrainian and Russian: ; ; ; sometimes spelled Sudac or Sudagh) is a city, multiple former Eastern Orthodox bishopric and double Latin Catholic titular see. It is of regional significance in Crimea, a territory recognized by most countries as part of Ukraine but annexed by Russia as the Republic of Crimea. Sudak serves as the administrative center of Sudak Municipality, one of the regions Crimea is divided into. It is situated to the west of Feodosia (the nearest railway station) and to the east of Simferopol, the republic&#x27;s capital. Population: 

A city of antiquity, today it is a popular resort, best known for its Genoese fortress, the best preserved on the northern shore of the Black Sea.

== History ==
===Foundation and early Middle Ages===
The date and circumstances of the city&#x27;s foundation are uncertain. The first written reference to the city dates to the 7th century (in the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;), but later local tradition places its foundation in 212 CE, and archaeological evidence supports its foundation in Roman times. The city was in all likelihood founded by the Alans, as its name in Greek sources, &quot;Sougdaia&quot; is a cognate of the adjective &quot;sugda&quot; (&quot;pure, holy&quot;) or derives from the word &quot;sugded&quot;/&quot;sogdad&quot; in the Ossetian language.

In the early Middle Ages, the city appears to have been under very loose Byzantine control, like other cities in the region. Archaeological remains indicate considerable construction activity near the shore in the 6th century. Under Byzantine influence, the city was subject to Christianization, and became the seat of a bishopric under the Patriarch of Constantinople, attested for the first time in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. Although a Greek-speaking population was probably settled in the city, the area remained dominated by the Alans: a 9th-century hagiography of Apostle Andrew places &quot;Upper Sougdaia&quot; elsewhere, between Zichia and the Cimmerian Bosporus, &quot;in the land of the Alans&quot;, while the hagiographer of Constantine the Philosopher mentions the tribe of &quot;Sougdoi&quot;, situated between the Iberians and the Crimean Goths, which the historian Francis Dvornik identifies as the Alans.

The period between the 8th and 11th centuries is obscure, but the available evidence points to a sharp decline in Sougdaia&#x27;s fortunes. Archaeological evidence shows that the 6th-century constructions were abandoned in the 8th/9th century, while later Russian legends (probably apocryphal) claim that the city was captured by the Rus&#x27; chieftain, Bravlin, at around the same time. Byzantine control lapsed, and the city probably came under Khazar suzerainty thereafter, which lasted until the early 11th century. In the early 10th century, the local see was promoted to an archbishopric.

===High and late Middle Ages===
The 11th–14th centuries represent a period of prosperity for the city, as shown in archaeological evidence of renewed activity both in the harbour as well as the hinterland and the area of the citadel. It became an important location for trading on the Silk Road in the 12th and 13th centuries, as a terminus for Black Sea trade. The 14th-century Arab traveller Ibn Battuta even compares its harbour with that of Alexandria. The 13th-century chronicler Ibn al-Athir writes of it as the &quot;city of the Qifjaq from which (flow) their material possessions. It is on the Khazar Sea. Ships come to it bearing clothes. The Qifjiqs buy from them and sell them slaves. Burtas furs, beaver, squirrels ...&quot;

By the mid-11th century, Sougdaia had returned to Byzantine control, probably following the defeat of the Khazar warlord Georgius Tzul in 1016. An inscription of 1059 mentions Leo Aliates, &quot;&quot;strategos&quot; of Cherson and Sougdaia&quot;. By the end of the century, however, the city passed under Cuman control, which lasted until the 13th century. In the Seljuk Turks besieged it, followed by destructive raids by the Mongol Empire in 1223 and 1238. Finally, in the city came under the control of the Mongol Golden Horde, although it retained considerable autonomy. Contemporary sources place its population at the time to 8,300, including Greeks, Alans, Mongols, Armenians, Latins, and Jews.
Under Tatar rule, the city was governed by the notables of the city and the 18 villages surrounding it. In the Greek sources they are mentioned by the Byzantine title &quot;sebastos&quot;, while the Latin sources use the Latinized Greek term &quot;proti&quot; (&quot;first men&quot;). Sometime between 1275 and 1282, the local see, which after being united with Phoulloi in the late 11th century was known as &quot;Sougdophoulloi&quot;, was raised to the status of a metropolitan see.

The city&#x27;s prosperity was increased by the establishment of Venetian and Genoese commercial colonies in the Crimea during the late 13th century, but at the same time, the area was drawn into the constant disputes between these two rival cities. In the early 14th century, the city was eclipsed by the Genoese colonies of Tana and Kaffa: the Florentine merchant Francesco Balducci Pegolotti, who visited the area in , neglects to mention the city altogether. At about the same time, the Tatars converted to Islam, which led to a deterioration of their relations with the Greek-speaking and Christian inhabitants of the city, many of whom were forced to leave it.

As a result, on 19 July 1365, the Genoese from Kaffa seized the city, which became a Genoese trading colony. The Genoese refortified the city, constructing the citadel that is still visible today, and induced a large part of the deported Greeks to return. Genoese rule lasted until 1475, when the Ottoman Grand Vizier Gedik Ahmed Pasha captured it after a long siege.

===Ottoman and modern periods===

The Ottomans took control of &quot;Soldaia&quot; and all other Genoese colonies, as well as the Principality of Theodoro in 1475. Although Sudak was the strategical center of a &quot;qadılıq&quot;, the smallest administrative unit in the Ottoman Empire, the town lost much of its military and commercial importance, until the Crimean Khanate took over.

In 1771, Sudak was occupied by Rumyantsev&#x27;s army. In 1783, it definitively passed to the Russian Empire, with the rest of Crimea. Though sometimes contested, it seems that a mass emigration occurred as a result of the ensuing instability in that period. Even Potemkin ordered in 1778 the eviction of the Christian population from Crimea. The town rapidly turned into a small village, and according to the 1805 census, Sudak had just 33 inhabitants.

In 1804, the first Russian school of viticulture was opened there.

The town acquired its present status in 1982.
== Ecclesiastical history ==

=== Byzantine metropolis of Sougdaia ===
It is unknown when the Byzantine see of Sougdaia was established, but it is attested for the first time in 787. It was in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, where it ranked 35th according to the &quot;Notitia Episcopatuum&quot; edited by Byzantine emperor Leo VI (). In the 10th century it was promoted to an archbishopric. After merging with the nearby see of Phoulloi towards the end of the 11th century, it was known as &quot;Sougdophoulloi&quot;. It was raised to metropolitan status in 1275/82.

Its historical bishops were :
* St. Stephen, 787
* Constantine, in 997.

See also Russian Orthodox Diocese of Surozh for Surozh, the old name of the city as an episcopal see in the Russian Orthodox Church, which has been nominally transferred to the Russian Orthodox Diocese in Great Britain and Ireland.

=== Latin bishopric of Soldaia ===
Under Genoese rule, a Latin Catholic diocese of Soldaia was established in 1390, which has had the following residential bishops :
* Bonifacius (19 August 1393 – ? death)
* John Greenlaw, O.F.M. (18 September 1400 – ?)
* Ludovico, O.P. (? – 15 December 1427)
* Agostino di Caffa, O.P. (23 July 1432 – ? death)
* Giovanni di Pera, O.P. (9 July 1456 – ? death)
* Leonard Wisbach, O.P. (6 October 1480 – ? death)

It was suppressed circa 1500 after the Ottoman conquest of the Crimea in 1475.

=== Latin titular metropolitan see of Sugdaea ===
In 1933 the see was nominally restored as titular bishopric of Sugdæa (Sugdaea), which was promoted in 1948 to metropolitan titular archbishopric.

It is vacant for decades, having had a single incumbent :
* Titular Archbishop Thomas Roberts, S.J. (1950.12.04 – 1970.12.07), emeritus as former Metropolitan Archbishop of Bombay (India) (1937.08.12 – 1950.12.04).

=== Latin titular episcopal see of Soldaia ===
In 1933 the diocese was nominally restored as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric.

<text>Lisístrata is a 2002 Spanish comedy film directed by Francesc Bellmunt. It is based on a comic book by the German cartoonist Ralf König, which in turn is loosely based on the play &quot;Lysistrata&quot; by Aristophanes.

==Plot==
It is the year 411 BC and the Peloponnesian War between Sparta (among others) and Athens has been raging for some 20 years. The women who want to see the conflict finally ended use a trick to make their husbands comply: led by the Feminist Lisístrata (Maribel Verdú), they barricade themselves on the Acropolis, where the Athenian treasure is kept, and refuse to have sex with their husbands until peace is restored.

The men soon sport gigantic erections, which as in Aristophanes&#x27; play are depicted by huge prosthetics that protrude from under the actors&#x27; clothes. This unfortunate state of &quot;blue balls&quot; hinders them in their capacity to fight. Luckily, the Spartans have the same problem.

To the rescue comes Hepatitos (Juan Luis Galiardo), the local homosexual and transvestite, who disguises himself as a medical doctor and advises the generals to order circumstantial homosexuality as a way to relieve the pressure in their men.

At first, the soldiers refuse, but quickly warm up to the idea — and soon everyone lives rather happily in male–male relationships. The women are not amused by this, as their plan has been foiled. However, as the soldiers begin to fall in love with enemy soldiers instead of fighting them, peace is finally established. The women end their strike (not to the delight of all men) and it is hinted that in the future, homosexual and heterosexual relationships will be regarded as relatively exchangeable.

While the film is primarily a bawdy comedy (even more so than the Greek play), it also contains interesting tidbits of historic truth, such as a relatively accurate life-size replica of the Pallas Athene statue by Phidias in the Parthenon.

The scene in which one soldier is about to kill an enemy fighter, but is moved by his beauty so much that he spares him and arranges a tête-à-tête with him after the battle, can be seen as being based on the legend of Achilles and Troilus, son of Priam.

<doc id="1292002" wikidata="Q1889985" url="?curid=1292002" title="Place-des-Arts station">
<text>Place-des-Arts station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. It is located in the Quartier des spectacles district, in east-central downtown.

== Overview ==

Designed by David, Boulva, et Cleve, it is a normal side platform station built in open cut under boul. De Maisonneuve, with two ticket halls joined by corridors that surround and overlook the platforms. The eastern mezzanine includes staircases with one-way exit-only turnstiles. The station is joined by underground city to Place des Arts and Université du Québec à Montréal, and has additional four street-level exits.

The station&#x27;s walls are coved in light-grey bricks in a zig-zag layout.

The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time until the next train arrives.

The station has 4 entrances:
: 1555, rue Jeanne-Mance
: 2020, rue de Bleury
: 1990, rue de Bleury
: 150, rue Ontario

== Architecture and art ==
The station features art by Frédéric Back: a massive stained glass mural entitled &quot;L&#x27;histoire de la musique à Montréal&quot; (&quot;history of music in Montreal&quot;). The work is composed of thousands of layered pieces of glass backlit by 105 lighting tubes and supported by a tonne of steel. The glass surface is rippled, causing the brilliant colours to shimmer ethereally. The work was originally intended to be an homage to four important Quebec musical artists: the composers Calixa Lavallée, Guillaume Couture, Alexis Contant, and soprano Dame Emma Albani. Unveiled on December 20, 1967, this stained glass was the first work of art to be commissioned for the Metro system. In 2008 the lighting system was completely renovated by the lighting artist Axel Morgenthaler.

The second work of art is a hand-glazed ceramic mosaic by the artist Saskia Siebrand, installed in 2005. It contains tiles of over 300 colours, all custom hand-glazed.

This architectural composition made of perforated aluminum panels was added to conceal a telecommunications room that had been added over the station&#x27;s western tunnel opening. Before this work was added, the Montréal métro featured only one mosaic, the one by Gabriel Bastien and Andrea Vau at Sherbrooke station.

== Accessibility ==
In March 2019, a real estate developer announced a new condo project on top of the De Bleury north entrance, and the entrance building was closed to the public. In the meantime, the STM also worked on improving the station&#x27;s accessibility by installing three elevators from the street level to the platforms. The entrance building reopened on June 16, 2022 and the station became accessible on July 21, 2022.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for the Place des Arts cultural complex. Opened in 1963, this complex includes five concert halls, including the largest multipurpose concert hall in Canada, and an art museum.

<doc id="1292004" wikidata="Q6156549" url="?curid=1292004" title="Japan Center for Michigan Universities">
<text>The (JCMU) is a study center operated by a consortium of the 15 public universities in the State of Michigan and the government of Shiga Prefecture in Japan. It is located on the shores of Lake Biwa, in the city of Hikone. Founded in 1988, JCMU offers May, summer, semester, and academic-year programs for the study of Japanese language and culture for American college and university students, a substantial number of them from Michigan, and provides English language instruction to serve the needs of the local Japanese population. The US administrative offices of JCMU are located at Michigan State University.

==History==
As a part of the continuing sister state relationship between Michigan and Shiga Prefecture, in 1988, an agreement was signed by the governors of Michigan and Shiga Prefecture to form the Japan Center for Michigan Universities. In September 1989, JCMU officially opened in a temporary building, the Cultural and Industrial Exchange Hall of Shiga, in Maibara, Shiga. The following September, construction on the JCMU campus in Hikone, Shiga was completed, and courses resumed there. In October 1998, an agreement was made with nearby Shiga University to provide courses on their campus. Five years later, in 2003, a similar agreement was made with the University of Shiga Prefecture, also in the same city.

==Facility==

The campus is located on the shore of Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, in Hikone, Shiga. It includes an academic building and a dormitory. Attached to the academic building is a Coco&#x27;s restaurant. In the academic building, there are classrooms, a library, conference rooms, a traditional Japanese tatami room, a large hall for functions, and administrative offices. The classrooms feature windows overlooking the lake, the surrounding mountains, nearby Hikone Castle, and a Japanese style garden. The dormitory features apartments for both students and faculty, a fitness room, a laundry room, a computer lab, an entertainment room, and a large lobby. Each apartment contains two private bedrooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom. There is one wheelchair-accessible dorm room available.

==Academics==
In the beginning the program was exclusively an academic year program for Japanese language and cultural studies; however, as it became apparent that this resulted in smaller class sizes, the administration expanded the program to allow students to choose to stay for only a semester.

Today JCMU typically has 6 academic programs throughout the year: the single semester program, the academic year program, the environmental sciences program, the May short program, the summer program, and the English language program for locals.

The main focus of the curriculum is intensive language study. It is loosely based on the curriculum at Michigan State University, although the professors take considerable freedom in adapting it to the needs of the facility. Students learn what they would normally learn in two semesters at Michigan State University in just one semester. During the summer, intensive language study is the only course that is offered during the eight-week term. During the two-week-long May short program, language courses are not offered but instead courses on specialized topics are offered, unique to each year.

While additional courses vary by the semester depending on the visiting professors, they have been known to include classes on culture, film, art, economics, religion and environmental science.

Other opportunities for students include staying with host families in the area, field trips, and the ability to do internships concurrently with the regular course load.

==Aichi World Expo==

In the summer of 2005, Expo 2005 (the World&#x27;s Fair) was held in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. The United States, absent from the Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany, was looking to participate in Expo 2005, and needed a facility to train guides. JCMU took on thirty young people in January 2005, primarily students, and trained them in polite language and the vocabulary that would be needed for the United States Pavilion. They were taught by the normal JCMU staff, divided into three classes due to the varying levels of ability among the guides; however, they were housed in a nearby resort hotel owned by Toyota due to the lack of space in the dormitory. In May, JCMU trained ten more guides who replaced those guides returning home early. Due to the success of the guide training program, JCMU has received more attention and praise.

== Michigan-Shiga Sister State Agreement 50th Anniversary ==
Michigan, Shiga, and JCMU began celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Michigan-Shiga sister state agreement in fall of 2017. The academic year opening ceremony in September 2017 featured the unveiling of a commemorative art piece and the planting of a symbolic tree. Michigan&#x27;s Governor Snyder and Shiga&#x27;s Governor Mikazuki were present, along with representatives of both governments. In September 2018, the governors met again to plant a tree in Michigan.

JCMU began celebrating its 30th anniversary at the same time, with a fundraisers, events, and a series of alumni reflections posted to their blog.

<doc id="1292010" wikidata="Q558967" url="?curid=1292010" title="Musaylima">
<text>Musaylima (), otherwise known as Musaylima ibn Ḥabīb () d.632, was a claimant of prophethood from the Banu Hanifa tribe. Based from Diriyah in present day Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, he claimed to be a prophet and was an enemy of Islam in 7th-century Arabia. He was a leader of the enemies of Islam during the Ridda wars. He is considered by Muslims to be a false prophet (). He is commonly called Musaylima al-Kadhāb (Musaylima the Arch-Liar) by Muslims. Musaylima was said to have composed in saj&#x27;, a type of rhymed prose that was common in pre-Islamic artistic speech.

==Etymology==
Musaylima&#x27;s actual name was &quot;Maslama&quot;, but Muslims altered his name to Musaylima, which is the diminutive of Maslama (i.e., &#x27;Little Maslama&#x27;).

==Early life==
Musaylima was the son of Habib, of the tribe Banu Hanifa, one of the largest tribes of Arabia that inhabited the region of Najd. The Banu Hanifa were a monotheist branch of Banu Bakr and led an independent existence prior to Islam.

Among the first accounts of him describe events in the late 9th Hijri, the Year of Delegations, when he accompanied a delegation of his tribe to Medina. The delegation included two other prominent Muslims. They would later help Musaylima rise to power and save their tribe from destruction. These men were Nahar Ar-Rajjal bin Unfuwa and Muja&#x27;a bin Marara. In Medina, the deputation stayed with the daughter of al-Harith, a woman of the Ansar from the Banu Najjar. When the delegation arrived at Medina the camels were tied in a traveler&#x27;s camp, and Musaylima remained there to look after them while the other delegates went in.

They had talks with Muhammad. The delegation before their departure embraced Islam and renounced Christianity without compunction. As was his custom, Muhammad presented gifts to the delegates, and when they had received their gifts one said, &quot;We left one of our comrades in the camp to look after our mounts.&quot;

Muhammad gave them gifts for him also, and added, &quot;He is not the least among you that he should stay behind to guard the property of his comrades.&quot; On their return they converted the tribe of Banu Hanifa to Islam. 

==Self-proclaimed prophethood==
Musaylima, who is alleged as having been a skilled magician by Muslim historians, is said to have performed unusual feats that amazed onlookers. Musaylima also shared verses purporting them to have been revelations from God. 

Al-Tabari in his History of the Prophets and Kings chronicles that Musaylima also proposed to share power over Arabia with Muhammad. On 10 Hijri, he wrote to Muhammad:

Muhammad, is said to have replied:

==Personal life==
During the Ridda wars which emerged following the death of Muhammad, Sajah bint al-Harith declared that she was a prophetess after learning that Musaylima and Tulayha had declared prophethood. 4,000 people gathered around her to march on Medina. Others joined her against Medina. However, her planned attack on Medina was called off after she learned that the army of Khalid ibn al-Walid had defeated Tulayha al-Asadi (another self-proclaimed prophet). Thereafter, she sought cooperation with Musaylima to oppose the threat of Khalid. A mutual understanding was initially reached with Musaylima. Eventually, the two married and she accepted his prophethood (although she later recanted and died a Muslim). Khalid then defeated the remaining rebellious elements around Sajah, and then moved on to defeat Musaylima.

== Death ==
Musaylima fought in the Battle of Yamama, and was killed by Wahshi ibn Harb.

== Dabestan-e Mazaheb ==
The Dabestan-e Mazaheb, a 17th century work on the religious beliefs in India during the time claims a religion called the Sadakiyya who followed Musaylima existed then. The work chronicles the alleged teachings of Musaylima according to an informant belonging to the group. At the Mughal ruler Akbar&#x27;s council of religions, a discussion on Sadakiyya also took place with the help of its priests.

In the account of Musaylima in the Dabestan-e Mazaheb, he taught 3 daily prayers to God, facing any direction. He criticized Muslims for selecting the Ka&#x27;aba as the direction of prayers, arguing that God is not limited to one direction. Musaylima declared that the Ka&#x27;aba was not the house of God, because an all-powerful God has no need for a house. Musaylima said fasting should be at night instead of daytime during Ramadan, he prohibited circumcision, he believed in equal rights for men and women, he allowed premarital sex, he prohibited polygamy and cousin marriage, he declared that any slave who converted to his religion would become free, he stated that Iblis did not exist, because a fair and merciful God would not allow a being like Iblis to throw people into error, and he also said it was wrong to include his name or any prophet’s name in worship to God.

<text>The Great Seal of the State of Vermont is the official seal of the U.S. state of Vermont, used to emboss and authenticate official documents. It was designed by Ira Allen, brother of Ethan Allen and one of the state&#x27;s founders.

==Great Seal==
The seal, depicts a 14-branched pine tree rising from the forest, with a grain sheaf above. The 14 branches symbolize the Thirteen Colonies and Vermont as the 14th state admitted to the union. A cow on the right, representing Vermont&#x27;s history of dairy farming, also appears. On the top of the seal are wavy lines, possibly suggesting clouds; on the bottom wavy lines suggest water. It is believed that the two sets of wavy lines might also suggest the Connecticut River and Lake Champlain, Vermont&#x27;s east and west borders. The passage &quot;Freedom &amp; Unity&quot;—Vermont&#x27;s state motto—is centered below the state name. The motto is central to the Vermont ideal of balancing personal freedom with the individual&#x27;s responsibility to their community. The seal was first used by the government of the independent Vermont Republic as it existed prior to admission to the Union.

Intended for use to emboss official documents, the seal is not intended for decorative use, the single exception being a large version carved in hardwood and affixed to the Vermont Pavilion at the Expo 67 World&#x27;s Fair. That seal was later used as a backdrop behind the podium in the Vermont State House Press Briefing Room, which is now the minority party&#x27;s caucus room. The large wooden Great Seal of Vermont has been moved to the working offices of the governor of Vermont at The Pavilion.

A more naturalistic and colorful armorial representation of the elements of the seal can be seen in the coat of arms of Vermont, which is found on the Vermont flag. It is also used on letterheads and on signs marking state buildings, bridges, state&#x27;s borders, and at Vermont welcome centers. By Vermont statute, the Great Seal of Vermont is the shared domain of the Vermont Secretary of State, the offices of the state governorship, and the legislative and judiciary branches of government. The original metal dies for the first seal of Vermont are stored at the Secretary of State&#x27;s office at Redstone, a large red brick and sandstone Queen Anne style house at Montpelier.

<text>New Hampshire is a state of the United States, located in the New England region. It is home to several professional performing institutions, including the more than 90-year-old fully professional Symphony New Hampshire (known from 1923-2012 as the Nashua Symphony) based out of Nashua, and the community-based New Hampshire Philharmonic.

The state of New Hampshire is unusual for having nine state songs.

==State song==
New Hampshire has nine state songs, although eight are &quot;honorary&quot; but not &quot;official&quot;.

The first state song was &quot;Old New Hampshire&quot;. This song was originally voted on by the legislature in 1941, but the song lost. In 1943, Rep. Samuel P. Philbrook sponsored legislation to create a contest to pick a state song, but this initiative failed as well. It was not until 1949 that &quot;Old New Hampshire&quot; became an official song.

The second was &quot;New Hampshire, My New Hampshire&quot; in 1963, then &quot;New Hampshire Hills&quot; in 1973. In early 1977, &quot;Autumn in New Hampshire&quot; became the fourth official song, and an interim board appointed by legislators recommended using only one official song and designating the others &quot;honorary&quot; state songs.

The board began considering which song to make official, as well as adding four new songs to consideration: &quot;Oh, New Hampshire (You&#x27;re My Home)&quot;, &quot;The Old Man of the Mountain&quot;, &quot;New Hampshire&#x27;s Granite State&quot; and &quot;The New Hampshire State March&quot;. &quot;Old New Hampshire&quot; was voted the official song in late 1977, and the others became &quot;honorary&quot;.

In 1983, a new honorary state song was added: &quot;New Hampshire Naturally&quot;.

==Rock music==
The rock band Aerosmith has its roots in New Hampshire, as lead singer Steven Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry spent their childhood summers in Sunapee. Other notable bands include The Bruisers, Dreadnaught USA, Our Last Night, Scissorfight, The Shaggs, And Then There Were None, Rick Rude, The Trichomes, The Brave Little Abacus, and The Queers. Punk rocker GG Allin was native to New Hampshire. Singer-songwriter Ray LaMontagne was born in Nashua, Ronnie James Dio, lead singer of Dio, was born in Portsmouth, and The Dropkick Murphys lead singer Al Barr was born in Hanover.

==Pop music==
Mandy Moore, a singer-songwriter and actress born in Nashua, has sold more than 10 million albums worldwide and won various awards for her acting performances. Singer JoJo was raised in Keene and is the youngest solo artist to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Songs chart. She has sold over 7 million albums worldwide.

==Hip-hop music==
New Hampshire has been home to producer and DJ Statik Selektah, a respected name in hip hop nationwide, since the 1990s. Statik Selektah, of Exeter, is closely associated with hip-hop artist Termanology of Lawrence, Massachusetts. The two have formed 1982 (group). Producer Decap of Nashua began producing in the early 2000s and has since produced records for artists like Talib Kweli, Joyner Lucas, and Hit-Boy. Bass player/producer Brady Watt, also a Nashua native, has worked closely alongside Ski Beatz, providing bass guitar on albums and songs by New Orleans rapper Curren$y, Joey Badass, and others. Rapper Adeem hails from Keene. Grammy Award-winning producer Brian Soko from Manchester has produced records for Beyoncé (&quot;Drunk in Love&quot;), and Lil Wayne.

==Classical==
Composer Amy Beach was born in Henniker.

Composer Edward MacDowell and his wife Marian summered at Hillcrest Farm in Peterborough at the turn of the 20th century. In 1907, toward the end of Edward&#x27;s life, Marian deeded the farm to the Edward MacDowell Association, founding the MacDowell Colony, an artists&#x27; colony which has hosted numerous composers, artists, and writers up to the present day.

== Vocal music ==
New Hampshire communities support a widespread and active tradition of choirs and local singing groups from master chorale to neighborhood singing clubs. Providing opportunities for performances in regular concerts and seasonal festivals for amateurs and professionals alike, vocal musical offerings are attended in an assortment of venues around the state. School choirs and their professional educators create an early love for singing that supports participation. Barbershop music is a popular pursuit in every corner of the state. Abenaki singers are often featured at seasonal Native American powwows.

<doc id="1292028" wikidata="Q695222" url="?curid=1292028" title="1949 West German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 14 August 1949 to elect the members of the first Bundestag, with a further eight seats elected in West Berlin between 1949 and January 1952 and another eleven between February 1952 and 1953. They were the first free federal elections in West Germany since 1933 and the first after the division of the country.

The CDU/CSU formed a centre-right coalition government with the FDP and the DP.

==Campaign==
After World War II, the German Instrument of Surrender and the country&#x27;s division into four Allied occupation zones, the elections were held in the Federal Republic of Germany, established under occupation statute in the three Western zones with the proclamation of its Basic Law by the &quot;Parlamentarischer Rat&quot; assembly of the West German states on 23 May 1949. Most West German parties at the time of the 1949 Bundestag election were committed to democracy, but they disagreed on what kind of democracy West Germany should become.

The Christian Democratic (CDU) leader, 73-year-old Konrad Adenauer, former mayor of Cologne and party chairman in the British Zone since March 1946, believed in moderate, non-denominational and Christian democracy, social market economy and integration with the West. In 1948 he had become president of the &quot;Parlamentarischer Rat&quot;, an office that added to his popularity as protagonist of a &quot;state-to-be&quot;. He attacked social democracy and the British, especially, dismantling of industry.

The Social Democratic (SPD) leader, Kurt Schumacher, wanted a united, democratic and socialist Germany. Schumacher had heavily agitated against the forced merger of the Communist Party (KPD) and SPD (both in the Soviet occupation zone) into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and he had also turned the party&#x27;s course away from the working class advocacy group of the Weimar Republic towards a left-wing big tent party with distinct patriotic features. He constantly accused Adenauer of betraying national interests, culminating in his heckling at the Bundestag session of 25 September 1949: &quot;The Chancellor of the Allies!&quot;. Schumacher criticized the Catholic Church, calling it the fifth occupying power and criticized denominational education.

==Results==
In the end and to the great disappointment of the Social Democrats, the CDU/CSU outnumbered them by 31.0% to 29.2% of the votes cast. Enough participating West Germans favoured Adenauer&#x27;s and his coalition partners&#x27; – the liberal Free Democrats&#x27; (FDP) and the conservative German Party&#x27;s (DP) – policies and promises over Schumacher&#x27;s and the other left-wingers&#x27; policies to give the centre-right parties a slight majority of deputies.

To enter the Bundestag, a party had to surmount a threshold of 5% at least in one of the states or to win at least one electoral district; ten parties succeeded. A number of non-voting members (elected in 1949:2 CDU, 5 SPD, 1 FDP; joined in February 1952 by: 3 CDU, 4 SPD, 4 FDP) indirectly elected by the West Berlin legislature (&quot;Stadtverordnetenversammlung&quot;) are included below in parentheses. The French Saar Protectorate did not participate in this election.

41 of the members elected to the Bundestag were refugees.

=== Results by state ===

==== Constituency seats ====
==== List seats ====
==Aftermath==
Schumacher had explicitly refused a grand coalition and led his party into opposition, where it would remain until December 1966, assuming the chair of the SPD parliamentary group as minority leader. On 12 September 1949, he lost the German presidential election, defeated by FDP chairman Theodor Heuss in the second ballot. Schumacher died on 20 August 1952 of the long-term consequences of his concentration camp imprisonment during the Nazi years.

Adenauer had favoured the formation of a smaller centre-right coalition from the beginning. Nominated by the CDU/CSU faction, he was elected the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany on 15 September 1949 by an absolute majority of 202 of 402 votes. Adenauer had ensured that the votes of the predominantly Social Democrat West Berlin deputies did not count and later stated that he &quot;naturally&quot; had voted for himself. On 20 September, he formed the Cabinet Adenauer I of CDU/CSU, FDP, and DP ministers. Chosen as an interim Chancellor, he held the office until 1963, being re-elected three times (in 1953, in 1957 and in 1961).

<text>Saint-Laurent station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro.

==Overview==
Designed by Brassard et Warren, it is a normal side platform station, built in an open cut under boul. de Maisonneuve. The station&#x27;s volume contains its mezzanine and ticket hall, connected to a single entrance. This is one of the few downtown stations not to have an entrance integrated into another building, and plans for the vacant lot around the station continually surface; the current plan is for a cultural centre, including a school of contemporary dance.
==Architecture and art==
The station contains non-figurative tiled murals by noted ceramicist Claude Vermette.

==Origin of the name==
The station takes its name from Saint Laurent Boulevard (in French, &quot;boulevard Saint-Laurent&quot;), a main thoroughfare of Montreal, opened and named by 1720 as the road joining Montreal to the village of Côte-Saint-Laurent, now a borough of Montreal. The latter was named for Saint Lawrence, probably by allusion to the Saint Lawrence River. Saint Laurent Boulevard is considered the dividing line between eastern and western Montreal, and divides addresses between east and west.

<doc id="1292048" wikidata="Q6197083" url="?curid=1292048" title="Jim Munson">
<text>Jim Munson (born July 14, 1946) is a former Canadian Senator and retired journalist.

==Early life and education==
Jim Munson was born in Woodstock, New Brunswick, although spent most of his childhood in Campbellton. His father was a minister in the United Church of Canada.

In 1960, his father transferred to St. Lambert United Church in Saint-Lambert, Quebec. As a result, the family relocated to Saint-Lambert where Jim Munson attended Chambly County High School, graduating in 1963.

==Journalism career==
Munson began his career in 1965 as a disc jockey with CJLS-FM in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. He spent most of his journalism career with CTV, which he joined in 1979 after working for Broadcast News for several years. He served as the network&#x27;s correspondent in Ottawa and then London, England. From 1987 to 1992 he was CTV&#x27;s bureau chief in Beijing and consequently covered the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He also covered the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War in the course of his career. Munson was let go by CTV in 2001.

==Political career==
A year later, in August 2002, he took employment with the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office as Jean Chrétien&#x27;s director of communications, often acting as the Prime Minister&#x27;s spokesman. On December 10, 2003, two days before retiring from office, Chrétien appointed Munson to the Senate of Canada where he served as the Whip of the Senate Liberal Caucus from 2008 to 2016.

Munson represents the province of Ontario in the Senate with his official designation including the region known as Ottawa-Rideau Canal.

Munson has not claimed a Senate housing allowance since it started in 2010 to post its expenses on the Internet. His primary residence is in the National Capital Region.

On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Munson, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. The Senators refer to themselves as the Senate Liberal Caucus even though they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.

With the Senate Liberal Caucus facing losing official parliamentary caucus status in 2020 with a third of its caucus facing mandatory retirements on their turning age 75, Senator Joseph Day announced that the Senate Liberal Caucus had been dissolved and a new Progressive Senate Group formed in its wake, with the entire membership joining the new group, including this senator.

Munson retired from the Senate on July 14, 2021, his 75th birthday.

<doc id="1292050" wikidata="Q1857458" url="?curid=1292050" title="Ted Hendricks">
<text>Theodore Paul Hendricks (born November 1, 1947), nicknamed &quot;the Mad Stork,&quot; is a Guatemalan-American former professional football linebacker who played for 15 seasons with the Baltimore Colts, the Green Bay Packers, and the Oakland / Los Angeles Raiders in the National Football League (NFL).

He was a member of four Super Bowl-winning teams, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990 after being elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987. He is the first Guatemalan-born player in the NFL. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes.

==Early life==
Hendricks was born on November 1, 1947, in Guatemala City to a Guatemalan-born mother of Italian descent and an American father. His parents met in Guatemala while working for Pan American Airlines. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Hialeah, Florida. Hendricks was raised in Miami Springs, Florida. He was an honor student at Hialeah High School, where he competed in basketball, baseball, track and field and football. Hendricks was raised bilingual and speaks fluent Spanish.

==College career==

Hendricks received 4 scholarship offers (baseball, basketball, football and academic) from the University of Miami. He accepted the Academic scholarship and took the honors curriculum as a math major and psychology minor. He is best known for his football prowess while playing stand-up defensive end for the University of Miami during the 1966 through 1968 seasons. He was a three-time All-American (1966,1967,1968) and finished fifth in the 1968 Heisman Trophy voting. In 1968, he was named National Lineman of the Year by the United Press. While in college, Hendricks became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

While playing for Miami, Hendricks made 327 total tackles (the most ever by a Miami defensive lineman). He also led the team in solo tackles by a defensive lineman with 139. Hendricks also recovered 12 fumbles during his playing career. He recorded a career-high of 4 quarterback sacks against the University of Florida in 1968. In his junior year of 1967 he caused nine turnovers.

It was at Miami that the tall, thin Hendricks gained the nickname &quot;the Mad Stork.&quot; It was a nickname that would follow him until his NFL days, when he was simply called &quot;the Stork&quot;. His Baltimore Colts teammate Mike Curtis attested to the appropriateness of the moniker, noting that when the 6&#x27;7&quot; Hendricks ran with &quot;those long, skinny legs flapping every which way...he really does look like a mad stork.&quot; (Hendricks has long advocated Curtis be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.)

Hendricks&#x27;s Miami jersey was retired in 1997. In 1987, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. In 2020, ESPN selected its list of the top 150 players in the history of college football, naming Hendricks at number 85.

Hendricks was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1980.

The Ted Hendricks Award is given annually to college football&#x27;s top defensive end. The award is presented by his own 501(c)(3) foundation, the Ted Hendricks Foundation.

==Professional career==

===Baltimore Colts===
Hendricks began his pro football career as a second-round pick of the Baltimore Colts in the 1969 NFL/AFL draft. He was initially listed as a defensive end, which is why he had the unusual number (for a linebacker) of 83. After coach Don Shula converted him to linebacker, he entered the starting lineup in the sixth game of his rookie 1969 season, the beginning of 69 consecutive starts with the Colts. He made 32 tackles and 2 sacks on the quarterback and knocked down 2 passes and blocked a field goal (the first of 25 blocked kicks in his career).

He played a key role in the Colts&#x27; 1970 Super Bowl V-winning season. He was the starting strong-side linebacker and recorded 67 tackles and 1-1/2 sacks while intercepting a pass. He also recorded 2 blocked kicks and knocked down 5 passes. He had the key sack of Oakland Raiders quarterback Daryle Lamonica in the AFC Championship Game, leading the Colts toward the Super Bowl. He and fellow linebackers Mike Curtis and Ray May anchored a unit that was one of the NFL&#x27;s best in defending against the run; which was 102.8 yards per game – 6th in the NFL, and allowing only 6 rushing touchdowns all season (tied with the Los Angeles Rams for second in the NFL). They allowed only 234 points, 7th in the NFL.

He was chosen to the first of four All-Pro selections in 1971 by the Associated Press (AP), Pro Football Writers of America, the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and Pro Football Weekly. He had 63 tackles and picked off 5 passes while batting away 7 passes. He also recorded 5 sacks and blocked 2 more kicks. He returned a fumble 31 yards for a touchdown. The Colts defense was ranked #1 in the NFL in fewest rushing yards allowed and lowest rushing attempt. The Colts made the playoffs but did not advance to the Super Bowl, losing to the Miami Dolphins.

In 1972 Hendricks recorded 99 tackles, 6 sacks, knocked down 7 passes, intercepted two passes and blocked 2 field goals. The following season Hendricks made 86 tackles and 4 sacks (bringing his Colt total to 18-1/2) and picked off 3 passes (making his Colt total 11) for 33 yards, while batting away 7 passes for the third consecutive season and blocking a punt. He was named second-team All-Pro in both 1972 and 1973 by the NEA, first team All-Conference both years by the AP, and United Press International (UPI) named him first team All-Conference in 1972 and second team All-Conference in 1973. In his Colts career, Hendricks intercepted 11 passes, had five fumble recoveries (including one for a touchdown), and unofficially had 347 tackles and 18½ sacks.He played out his option with the Colts who then traded him to the Packers.

===Green Bay Packers===
One week after signing to begin play in 1975 with the World Football League&#x27;s Jacksonville Sharks, Hendricks was traded along with a 1975 second-round pick (28th overall–traded to Los Angeles Rams for John Hadl) from the Colts to the Green Bay Packers for Tom MacLeod and a 1975 eighth-round selection (192nd overall–Northwestern State running back Mario Cage) on August 13, 1974.

He was assigned jersey no. 56. Hendricks was then in the second straight option year of his NFL contract, and had one of his best seasons: five interceptions, seven blocked kicks (3 field goals, 3 punts and 1 extra point) and a safety, two sacks, 75 tackles, and two knocked down passes while again earning consensus first team All-Pro honors for the second time from the AP, Pro Football Writers, NEA and Pro Football Weekly.

With the World Football League bankrupt, owner Al Davis of the Raiders sent two first round draft choices to the Packers for the rights to Hendricks, signing him as a limited free agent.

===Oakland / Los Angeles Raiders===
After the trade, Hendricks went on to nine seasons with the Raiders before retiring after the 1983 season. In his first year on the Raider team, coach John Madden used him sparingly, partly as a result of a feud Madden had with Al Davis. He started only five of 14 games. However, Madden eventually had him starting by the end of the 1975 season. Hendricks recorded only 27 tackles and 3 passes batted and 2 interceptions. He was used in the Raiders nickel defense and recorded 5 sacks in that role. He also had a safety.

He also recorded 4 sacks in a playoff win against the Cincinnati Bengals. His final sack of Kenny Anderson took the Bengals out of field goal range, with Bengal&#x27;s coach Paul Brown saying Hendricks &quot;&#x27;earned his entire season&#x27;s salary with that one play.&#x27;&quot; Injuries limited the number of defensive lineman Madden had available so he used Hendricks as a stand-up defensive end, the position Hendricks played in college. At season&#x27;s end the Raiders defense was among the NFL&#x27;s top units, despite injuries to a few key defensive linemen. The Raiders led the NFL in interceptions and they ranked 2nd in the NFL in sacks, 7th in fewest points allowed, and were 3rd in total defense.

The next year Hendricks became a full-time player with the Raiders, and the Raiders switched to a 3–4 defense early in the season. Hendricks played the weakside linebacker, since All-Pro Phil Villapiano played Hendricks&#x27;s strong-side; he made 57 tackles, 6 sacks, knocked down 5 passes while picking off one and blocking 2 punts. The Raiders defense was 6th in the NFL in sacks but did not finish in the top ten in points allowed or total defense. The Raiders won Super Bowl XI, the first in franchise history, and the first of three Super Bowl titles in seven seasons. Hendricks was second-team All-Pro for the first of three consecutive years.

In 1977, Hendricks moved back to the strong-side linebacker position due to Villapiano&#x27;s injury and made 56 tackles, 2 sacks and knocked down 4 passes. The Raider defense was 7th in the NFL against the run and tied for 3rd in allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns. They also tied for third in the NFL with 26 interceptions.

In the 1978 season Hendricks recorded a stellar season with 78 tackles, 6 sacks, 3 interceptions, 8 passes defensed and 2 fumble recoveries. The defense tied for 4th in most interceptions in the NFL and scored 4 defensive touchdowns which tied them for 2nd most in the NFL. They were tied for 10th in fewest points allowed as well.

A vote among Raider coaches showed that all of them had voted to release Hendricks at season&#x27;s end. However, owner Al Davis insisted on keeping Hendricks. Hendricks ended up making 76 tackles with a career-high 8-1/2 sacks, 3 interceptions (bringing his career total to 26) while batting 16 passes and blocking 3 kicks. The defense rebounded to #5 against the run in the NFL, #1 in intercepting passes, and were 3rd in sacking opponents quarterbacks, and 11th in the NFL in total defense and 10th in fewest points allowed. In 1980 he was a consensus first-team All-Pro for the first time since 1974 and he helped the Raiders to their win in Super Bowl XV while going to another Pro Bowl.

Hendricks was All-Pro and All-AFC in the strike-shortened 1982 season as Hendricks made 28 tackles and seven sacks in just nine games while he deflected 2 passes. The Raiders were 8–1 but were stunned in a playoff loss to the New York Jets, although Hendricks had a sack and two fumble recoveries in the game. The Raiders defense was 2nd in fewest rushing yards allowed and first in sacking the opposing quarterback, while being 22nd overall in points allowed, and 27th out of 28 teams in passing yards allowed.

In his final campaign, 1983, Hendricks played less than at any point since 1975 but still made his eighth Pro Bowl and was second team All-AFC while recording 41 tackles, two sacks and deflecting four passes. He also blocked the 25th kick of his career and was a part of the Raiders Super Bowl XVIII victory, though he did not record a defensive statistic. The defense was 4th in the NFL against the run, tied for 2nd in sacking the quarterback, and fifth in total defense and 13th in allowing the fewest points allowed while being eighth in allowing the fewest touchdowns from scrimmage.

==Accomplishments==
Hendricks was a member of four Super Bowl-winning teams (three with the Raiders and one with the Colts) and was a Pro Bowl selection eight times, at least once with each of his three NFL teams.

Hendricks played in 215 consecutive regular-season games. He also participated in eight Pro Bowl games, seven AFC championships, and four Super Bowls (V with the Colts, XI, XV and XVIII with the Raiders).

<text>Kálmán de Kánya (7 November 1869 – 28 February 1945) was the Foreign Minister of Hungary during the Horthy era. 

Kánya commenced his diplomatic career in Constantinople. In 1913 he was appointed as Austro-Hungarian ambassador to Mexico and later to Berlin. From 1933 he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs. 

During Kánya&#x27;s tenure Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, becoming an ally of Nazi Germany. He attempted to counterbalance Germany&#x27;s hegemony with increased cooperation with Italy and kept good connections with the Little Entente.

Kánya travelled with Hungarian Prime Minister Béla Imrédy to Berchtesgaden to advocate on behalf of Hungarian territorial claims. Kánya was leader of the Hungarian-Czechoslovak delegation on the negotiations in Komárom. 

On 21 November 1938 Kánya was forced to resign following the failure of the German-Italian démarche Carpathian Ukraine invasion. During the end of the Second World War he supported István Bethlen and Miklós Kállay.

<text>The Institute of Engineering (IOE) (Nepali: ईन्जिनियरिङ अध्ययन संस्थान), established in 1930, is one of the five technical institutes under Tribhuvan University, Nepal&#x27;s largest academic institution. The current dean of the IOE is Shashidhar Ram Joshi.

IOE runs undergraduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. programs. It previously ran Diploma courses till 2012. The institute has five constituent and ten affiliated campuses in the country. Its constituent campus are namely Pulchowk Campus, Thapathali Campus, Paschimanchal Campus, Purbanchal Campus and Chitwan Engineering Campus.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The history of engineering education in Nepal can be traced to 1930, when a Technical Training School was established in Kumari Chowk, Kathmndu. The engineering section of the school offered only trades and civil sub-overseers programs. In 1959, the Nepal Engineering Institute was established with the assistance of the government of India which started offering civil overseer courses leading to a Diploma in Civil Engineering. The Technical Training Institute established in 1965 at Thapathali, with the assistance from the Government of Federal Republic of Germany which offered technician courses in general courses in General Mechanics, Auto Mechanics, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Drafting.

In 1972, the Nepal Engineering Institute at Pulchowk and the Technical Training Institute at Thapathali were brought together under the umbrella of Tribhuvan University to constitute the Institute of Engineering. The Nepal Engineering Institute and the Technical Training Institute were later renamed as Pulchowk campus and Thapathali Campus respectively.

=== Establishment of constituent campuses ===
Later, Pashchimanchal Campus in Pokhara of IOE became operational from 1987 while Purwanchal Campus in Dharan which began operating from 1984. Recently, Chitwan Engineering Campus was established in Rampur, Chitwan in 2019, where only Architecture is offered.

== Admission ==

=== Entrance examinations ===
Entrance examinations are conducted by Institute of Engineering yearly for undergraduate and postgraduate intake. The entrance exam for the undergraduate intake is said to be tough where more than 15,000 students from all over Nepal vie for to secure seats. Getting into Pulchowk Engineering College is the toughest followed by Thapathali Campus, as the higher ranked students are more likely to choose them While Pulchowk Campus takes just 624 students from approx. 10,000 candidates, Thapathali Campus takes almost 432 students which roughly estimates the acceptance rate to be 10% jointly. But to get computer and civil engineering is the toughest especially onto Pulchowk Campus as the seats are fulfilled under 31 and 230 rank respectively for full scholarship. While on the paying basis they are fulfilled under 210 and 400 rank respectively. The lower ranked students in the pool are likely to choose other branches or other affiliated colleges. Getting into constituent campuses of IOE is by far the toughest engineering entrance in the country.

<text>Robert James Mattick (December 5, 1915 – December 16, 2004) was an American professional baseball player, scout, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop for the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds. After his playing career, he most notably worked in the Toronto Blue Jays organization, including two seasons as the team&#x27;s manager.

==Playing career==
Born in Sioux City, Iowa, Mattick was the son of outfielder Wally Mattick, who played for the Chicago White Sox in 1912 and 1913 and the St. Louis Cardinals in 1918. Bobby played only one season as a regular with the Chicago Cubs in 1940, although he played for the Cubs from 1938 to 1940 and the Cincinnati Reds in 1941 and 1942. Hampered in 1936 by a foul ball which cracked his skull above his right eye and caused double vision, he was a career .233 hitter with no home runs and 64 RBIs in 206 games.

==Post-playing career==
Mattick began his managerial career in the Southern League in 1944 and 1945.

From 1946 to 1978, Mattick worked for nine different baseball organizations including as a scout for the Reds, Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers and Montreal Expos. He was credited by some baseball personnel as an incomparable longtime scout and player development specialist, signing such stars as Frank Robinson, Vada Pinson, Curt Flood, Rusty Staub, Don Baylor, and Gary Carter.

One of the Blue Jays&#x27; original employees in its inaugural season, Bobby joined the team in 1976 as the scouting supervisor, and helped draft the expansion Blue Jays.

In 1978 Mattick was appointed the director of player development. 1980 saw him take over the role of manager from Roy Hartsfield, the Blue Jays&#x27; original manager, becoming the oldest rookie manager to start a season at 64. Mattick turned down the job several times before finally accepting; he had initially wanted to manage the team only if he could wear his regular business clothing while in the dugout, rather than a uniform. This would have made him the first manager to not wear a uniform since Connie Mack retired in the early 1950s, but the Blue Jays insisted that Mattick wear a uniform.

The Blue Jays had their best season of their young existence in 1980, missing the 100-loss mark for the first time and finishing at 67–95. The following season was interrupted by the 1981 MLB strike, and the Blue Jays improved their winning percentage but still finished in last place in the American League East division in both halves of the season. Mattick was offered the opportunity to continue managing the Blue Jays for a third season, but elected to step down.

Following the 1981 season and a 104–164 career record during his two-year tenure as manager, Mattick continued to work in the organization as executive co-ordinator of baseball operations before his promotion to vice president of baseball in 1984.

Mattick played a key administrative role in scouting and development, leading to the Blue Jays&#x27; five AL East division championships, and World Series crowns in and .

Mattick was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, and the club renamed its spring training complex the Bobby Mattick Training Center at Englebert Complex in 2003. He was part of the Blue Jays&#x27; delegation at the 2004 Winter Meetings in Anaheim, California.

Mattick died 11 days after his 89th birthday after suffering a stroke at his Scottsdale, Arizona, home. Mattick&#x27;s wife Jackie had died about two years previously. They had no children.

<doc id="1292063" wikidata="Q827090" url="?curid=1292063" title="Berri–UQAM station">
<text>Berri–UQAM station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and is the system&#x27;s central station. This station is served by the Green, Orange, and Yellow lines. It is located in the Quartier Latin.

Berri–UQAM is the 2nd deepest station in the network, and also the busiest station in the network, transfers not included. If transfers were included, the 13 million passengers number would rise to about 35–40 million a year.

==History==

The station opened as Berri–De Montigny with the opening of the Metro on October 14, 1966, serving the Green and Orange lines. 

The station was the site of the inauguration of the Metro by Mayor of Montreal Jean Drapeau, president of the Commission de transport de Montréal Lucien L&#x27;Allier and Archbishop of Montreal Paul-Émile Léger. A plaque commemorating the inauguration is located in the mezzanine. The Yellow Line entered service on April 28, 1967, serving the Expo 67 site on Île Sainte-Hélène. 

In 1988, the station was renamed Berri–UQAM after the Université du Québec à Montréal located adjacent to the station. 

On September 2, 2001, a canister of tear gas was set off inside the station, forcing the evacuation of the 300 passengers inside.

=== Station refurbishment ===
In 2007, STM began planning to refurbish the station, after learning that the waterproofing of the station had been compromised. Construction began in 2010, with renovation of electrical, mechanical and structural components including waterproofing the underground roof and upgrades to fire protection and ventilation systems. The work also included improvements to lighting, refurbishment of staircases, new architectural facings including wall tiling and ceilings, rearranging of corridors to the Orange and Green line platforms, as well as refurbishment and renovation of the entrance buildings. 

The renovation and upgrade works were planned for completion in 2025, however media reported in April 2024 that the work was significantly behind schedule. Estimated completion of the waterproofing works is now &quot;around 2027 to 2029&quot;. 

==== Accessibility ====
Alongside the renovation work, the station has been made partially accessible through the addition of elevators. In September 2009, two elevators connect the Orange Line platforms to the mezzanine, with an elevator connecting the street to the mezzanine opening in 2010. In November 2020, work to make the Green Line platforms accessible was completed, with the opening of two additional elevators. , construction to provide elevators to the Yellow Line is underway, despite the technical challenge of excavating and building new elevators below street level. 

Upon completion of the works, the station will have seven elevators allowing step-free access to all three lines, as well as to the street.

==Overview==

Designed by Longpré and Marchand, the station serves three lines: the Green, Orange, and Yellow Lines.

The main part of the station is a cruciform cut and cover volume built underneath the intersection of rue Berri and boulevard de Maisonneuve; the volume is so large that the station&#x27;s design had to include massive pillars to support the street.

This central volume contains three levels. The upper level contains the rectangular mezzanine at its centre, with fare gates on all four sides; the arms extend out to the station&#x27;s entrances, with two more entrances at the crossing, and are also lined with shops and services. Staircases lead from the mezzanine to the landings on either side of the Orange Line. These landings provide views of the great volumes over the Green Line platforms below.

From the Green Line level, escalators and hallways connect the rest of the station to the Yellow Line terminus, built in a tunnel a block away under rue Saint-Denis, around below the surface. Limited space in the Yellow Line tail tracks cause trains to reverse both in the tail tracks and in the foretracks when they leave the station.

All three lines have side platforms. The station was the first to be equipped with the MétroVision information screens, which displays news, commercials, and the time until the next train arrives.

The mezzanine can be accessed from the street via elevators in the Grande Bibliothèque du Québec and UQAM&#x27;s Pavillon Judith-Jasmin; but those buildings are closed during some of the Metro&#x27;s operating hours. However, there is an elevator in the Saint-Denis exit, which opened in June 2010 and is open throughout the operating hours.

The station has 5 entrances:

* Entrance A: 1500 Rue Berri
* Entrance B: 505 Rue Sainte-Catherine Est
* Entrance C: 850 Boulevard de Maisonneuve Est
* Entrance D: 1470 Rue Saint-Denis 
* 1621 Rue Berri (no letter assigned)
* Place Dupius (in food court 7 am-7pm)

== Station layout ==
== Architecture and art ==
The station has a total of four independent exits: three integrated into buildings (the Berri, Saint-Denis, and Place Dupuis exits) and one free-standing kiosk (the Sainte-Catherine exit). The station also contains several underground city connections, listed below. 

The 1967 station was designed by Longpré et Marchand, with a 1999 free-standing kiosk entrance designed by architect Gaétan Pelletier.

=== Artwork ===
The work of five artists is exhibited in this station. The largest work is a stained-glass mural by Pierre Gaboriau and Pierre Osterrath entitled &quot;Hommage aux fondateurs de la ville de Montréal&quot; (homage to the founders of the city of Montreal). A gift of the Union régionale de Montréal des caisses populaires Desjardins and installed in 1969, it depicts Jérôme le Royer de la Dauversière, Jeanne Mance, and Paul Chomedey, sieur de Maisonneuve. It is located over the eastern portal of the Green Line tunnel.

Three paintings by are located over the main staircase leading to the Yellow Line terminus. Originally located at the entrance to Expo 67, they represent three themes of the Expo: science, recreation, and culture.A plaque by LaPalme and Georges Lauda, commemorating the inauguration of the Metro, is located at the centre of the mezzanine. It is enclosed in a black circular bench, a popular meeting site, referred to as &quot;la rondelle&quot; (the hockey puck) or &quot;la pilule&quot; (the pill) or &quot;le banc des fous&quot; (the crazy bench).
In the newer Sainte-Catherine entrance pavilion, a statue of Mother Émilie Gamelin by Raoul Hunter, commemorating Place Émilie-Gamelin (also called Berri Square) in which the entrance is located. The statue is owned by the City of Montreal.

The most recent art piece put in place inside the station is the Wall of Peace on the concourse level of the Yellow Line. It consists of coloured metal plates bearing the word &quot;peace&quot; in multiple languages.

==Origin of the name==
Berri–UQAM is named for both Berri Street, so called since 1663, and for the Université du Québec à Montréal. The university has taken to using UQAM as its abbreviation, which it displays as UQÀM (with a grave accent over the &quot;A&quot; as its logo; the station retains the UQAM form).

Until 1988, the station was named Berri–De Montigny; rue de Montigny is the former name of boulevard de Maisonneuve in this area. Small stubs of de Montigny street still survive in Downtown Montreal between Saint Laurent Boulevard and Saint Urbain Street and in the Montréal-Est suburb.

== Connections ==
The station is served by several STM bus routes. Gare d&#x27;autocars de Montréal, Montreal&#x27;s main intercity bus terminal, is located close to the station.

<text>The Battle of Tuchola Forest (, ) was one of the first battles of World War II, during the invasion of Poland. The battle occurred from 1 September to 5 September 1939 and resulted in a major German victory. 

Poor Polish command and control, as well as German numerical and tactical superiority, allowed the Germans to manage to cripple Poland&#x27;s Armia Pomorze (Army Pomerania) and, by breaking through the Polish Corridor, to connect mainland Germany with East Prussia. 

The battle was fought against the judgment of General Władysław Bortnowski, the commander of Army Pomerania, who believed the Corridor to be a very poor defensive position and had repeatedly asked for permission to withdraw his forces from it.

== Prelude ==

Tuchola Forest (, ) in Westprussia, since 1920 Treaty of Versailles in the Polish Corridor, is a large area of mostly forest. Its difficult terrain was thought by the Polish high command as a good defensive position. However, the Germans had held their &quot;Truppenübungsplatz Gruppe&quot; military exercises in the area until 1919, and were therefore familiar with it, and furthermore General Heinz Guderian had been born in nearby Chełmno).

Polish forces in the theater comprised elements of the Pomeranian Army: 9th Infantry Division under colonel Józef Werobej, the 27th Infantry Division under general Juliusz Drapella, and Czersk Operational Group under gen. Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki. Facing the German exclave of East Prussia was the Operational Group East under General Mikołaj Bołtuć, consisting of the 4th Infantry Division and 16th Infantry Division.

German forces in the theater were composed of elements of the 4th German Army under general Günther von Kluge, specifically 19th Panzer Corps (commanded by general Heinz Guderian), and 2nd Army Corps under general Adolf Strauß. Those units were based in Western Pomerania west of the corridor. The XXI Army Corps of the German 3rd Army would simultaneously advance from East Prussia, in a pincer movement across the Polish corridor, while the bulk of the 3rd Army would attack the Modlin Army in the direction of Warsaw. 

19th Panzer Corps consisted of the 2nd Motorized Division under general Paul Bader, the 20th Motorized Division under general Mauritz von Wiktorin and the 3rd Panzer Division under general Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg. 2nd Army Corps was composed of two infantry divisions: the 3rd Infantry Division under general Walter Lichel and 32nd Infantry Division under general Franz Böhme.

== Battle ==

=== September 1 ===
Moving quickly after crossing the border at 0445 on September 1, the German forces made contact with the Polish defenses along the Brda River around 0915. The 5th Panzer Regiment of the 3rd Panzer division attempted to seize the railway bridge at Pruszcz, held by the 3rd Battalion of the 34th Infantry Regiment of the Polish 9th Division. The Polish defenders successfully destroyed a Panzer IV tank and held up the Germans for two hours, buying time to partially destroy the bridge at the cost of 22 killed. Meanwhile, the 6th Panzer Regiment attacked Wielka Klonia, held by the 1st Battalion of the 34th Infantry Regiment, and lost two Panzer II tanks to Polish anti-tank fire. The Germans fell back and shelled the village, killing four Poles. Frustrated by these delays, Guderian ordered his motorcyclists to cross the river in rubber boats at Sokole-Kuźnica, this was accomplished by 1800 hours, and after clearing the Polish defenders from the far bank German engineers were able to begin repairs of the bridges over the Brda. To the north of Pruscz near Gostycyn the 6th Panzer Regiment engaged the remainder of the 34th Infantry Regiment in inconclusive combat which lasted until midnight.

To the north of this action, at 1130 the German 2nd Motorized Infantry Division encountered the Polish 35th Infantry Regiment, also of the 9th Division, dug in near the town of Tuchola. General Bader ordered a series of frontal assaults across flat, marshy terrain which were repeatedly repulsed with considerable casualties until the Polish troops withdrew around 1800 due to the risk of encirclement from the south by Guderian&#x27;s panzers.

The 20th Motorized Division was tasked with capturing Chojnice, held by three Polish territorial defense (ON) battalions. An initial attempt to seize the city with an armored train and two platoons of commandos failed, and resulted in the destruction of the train by the Polish defenders. During the late morning and early afternoon the 20th Division slowly enveloped the Polish positions, and the ON battalions withdrew at 1400 to avoid encirclement. Their withdrawal to the northeast was covered by a mounted attack by the 18th Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment, known to history as the charge at Krojanty, which managed to scatter the troops of the German 76th Motorized Infantry Regiment, but then encountered a squadron of armored cars, which cut down nearly a third of the Polish riders, including the unit&#x27;s commander Kazimierz Mastalerz.

The 2nd Army Corps on Guderian&#x27;s right flank advanced largely unmolested, annihilating the isolated ON battalion defending Wiecbork.

All day on September 1st the German XXI Army Corps, attacking from the exclave of East Prussia, attempted to secure a crossing over the Vistula and link up with Guderian. Their attempt to seize the bridges at Tczew at 0445 was foiled and the bridges were blown at 0600. The town was captured in the afternoon by Waffen-SS troops advancing south from Danzig. Having failed to secure the bridges, XXI Corps proceeded southwards and became locked in a positional battle with the Polish 16th Infantry Division dug in along the Osa, a minor tributary of the Vistula. It secured a bridgehead at 1600 hours near Rogozno-Zamek.

=== September 2 ===
During the night, General Bortnowski repositioned the 27th Infantry Division southwards to conduct a counterattack against Guderian&#x27;s bridgehead over the Brda. This attack was meant to be coordinated with the 9th Division but the two units never made contact. On September 2nd the 27th Division launched a piecemeal assault on Swiekatowo and Tuszyny which initially drove back the German reconnaissance elements but was broken up by the arrival of German armored cars, which inflicted considerable losses. The 27th Division retreated southwards in disarray.

Troops of the 9th Division, meanwhile, were still engaged in the defenses of the bridges over the Brda at Piła-Młyn, north of the German bridgehead. These were destroyed at 1000. The 35th Regiment, which had repositioned south from Tuchola, launched an attack against the left flank of the 3rd Panzer Division but was repulsed with heavy casualties. The German 32nd Infantry Division, part of the 2nd Corps advancing on Guderian&#x27;s right, launched its own attack on the 9th Division&#x27;s 22nd Infantry Regiment, which had not yet been seriously engaged, in the vicinity of Koronowo, and shattered the Polish unit.

Meanwhile, the German XXI Corps, advancing from East Prussia, now had a pontoon bridge over the Osa, and the 21st Infantry Division launched an assault across the river, driving back the Polish 16th Division. The 10th Panzer Regiment drove through the gap, seizing the town of Melno and threatening the rear of the Polish army. This threat of encirclement sparked a panic among the troops of the 16th Division, which began to scatter and retreat southwards. The 4th Infantry Division, positioned to the right of the 16th, launched a counterattack to relieve the beleaguered Polish unit and had some initial success, taking 100 German prisoners, but the attack ran out of steam, and the German XXI Corps continued to push towards the southwest.

By the end of the day, a significant portion of the Polish forces were disorganized or in retreat, with the remainder facing the threat of encirclement by the German pincer movement. The remainder of the 9th Division, including the 35th and 22nd Regiments, began to disengage and join the retreat southwards towards Bydgoszcz, where the 15th Division was still dug in.

=== September 3 ===
On September 3, Guderian recognized the situation of the Polish forces and began orienting most of his force towards Bydgoszcz, sending only reconnaissance elements onwards to secure Chelmno. Around noon the German Luftwaffe began to launch air attacks on the retreating Polish columns which inflicted heavy losses, including most of the 9th Division&#x27;s artillery. Some troops of the 9th and 27th Divisions were caught by the advancing panzers and surrounded near the village of Bukowiec, where 846 Polish troops were captured by the 3rd Panzer Division after a three hour battle. Pressed up against the Vistula with their route to Bydgoszcz cut, 4,000 Polish troops would be captured by the end of the day, with only the 35th Infantry Regiment managing to escape.

In Bydgoszcz, Gen. Bortnowski had at his disposal the 15th infantry division, about ⅓ of the 2nd infantry division, two surviving battalions of the 22nd regiment, and about a quarter of the Pomorska cavalry brigade. Nearly all were disorganized and exhausted. Bortnowski decided to abandon the city and establish a new defensive line on the south bank of the Vistula, but roughly 1,000 German Nazi sympathizers, organized by Abwehr infiltrators and armed by the SS, staged a diversionary uprising, firing from windows and killing 20 Polish troops of the 22nd Infantry Regiment. The 62nd infantry regiment of the 15th division was tasked with restoring order; Polish troops rounded up 600 local Germans and killed 100 others, some in combat and some in summary executions. The next day however, September 4, saw more sniping by local Germans, resulting in retaliation from the Polish troops which killed as many as 150 further fighters and civilians. This event was magnified by German propaganda into the “Bromberg Massacre”, falsely claiming that 5,000 Germans had been killed. On September 5 German troops entered the city, followed by the SS Einzatzgruppen 4 and SS-Standarte-Totenkopf division, which rounded up and killed 192 Poles, including city officials and other political figures, in the first week of the occupation. Prison camps were established in the area which held over 7,000 prisoners by November.

== Aftermath ==

By 5 September, the Germans had in large part completed their takeover of the Polish Corridor. At that point some German forces moved to erase isolated pockets of Polish resistance further north in fortified areas on the Baltic Coast, while others continued their push south-east, deeper into Polish territory.

On 6 September, Adolf Hitler visited Guderian and congratulated him on his swift progress.

About two-thirds of &quot;Armia Pomorze&quot; survived the battle, regrouped, and were reconstituted under &quot;Armia Poznań&quot; (Army Poznań) in time to fight in the Polish counteroffensive at the Battle of the Bzura.

Ultimately, Polish units, when dug-in and defending their chosen strongpoints, fought well and managed to inflict casualties on the German attackers, but the Polish troops were spread too thin, and coordination between units, even regiments of the same division, was very poor. German losses were fairly modest, with only 150 dead and 700 wounded in Guderian&#x27;s XIX Panzer Corps, and several dozen tanks knocked out. German air power and mobility gave them a considerable technological advantage over the Polish forces, which struggled to keep pace with their opponents in a war of movement.

<text>Sonia Marina Clarke (born 21 June 1965), better known by her stage name Sonique, is a British singer, musician and DJ. She came to public attention as a member of dance band S&#x27;Express during the early 1990s, but achieved greater success as a solo artist in the early-to mid 2000s. During this period, she achieved UK top 20 hits with &quot;It Feels So Good&quot;, &quot;Sky&quot;, &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Make Up My Mind&quot;, and won the 2001 BRIT Award for British female solo artist.

==Biography==
===1965–1983: Early life===
Clarke was born and raised in Crouch End to parents of Trinidadian descent. The first record she ever purchased was Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot;. When Sonique was sixteen, her mother remarried and moved back to Trinidad. She refused to move with her mother and two siblings and instead stayed in London, moving into the YMCA.

===1983–1996: Early music career===
At the age of seventeen, a youth worker commented that she had a nice voice and suggested she use it. She put together a reggae band called &#x27;Fari&#x27;, in which she ended up writing all the music. After Fari disbanded she set about getting a recording contract.

Sonique released the single &quot;Let Me Hold You&quot;, published by Cooltempo, in 1985. The single hit the top 40 on the UK Dance Chart.

In 1990, she was credited for the track &quot;Zombie Mantra&quot;, which was included on the album &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Bass&quot;, the debut record of William Orbit&#x27;s project Bass-O-Matic. Soon after, she teamed again with DJ Mark Moore, a few years after providing vocals for S&#x27;Express. The dance-pop duo charted on the UK Singles Chart with singles such as &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;. She maintained a friendship with Mark Moore after S&#x27;Express disbanded and, shortly afterwards, he gave her the gift of a set of turntables and a mixer with which she began experimenting.

===1997–2001: DJ career===
For three years, she accompanied both Mark Moore and her childhood friend Judge Jules to their gigs. She eventually signed to London-based label Serious Records, where her first single was &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; produced by Chris Allen and ex-Wang Chung keyboardist Graeme Pleeth. She was DJ-in-residence at Club Manumission in Ibiza between 1997 and 1999.

In 1998, she came to the attention of UK promoters/label Fantazia and was asked to mix one of the discs on their album &quot;Fantazia British Anthems Summertime&quot;. The album was certified gold in the UK.

Sonique released her debut solo album &quot;Hear My Cry&quot; in 1998. Re-released in 2000, the album&#x27;s hit single &quot;It Feels So Good&quot; topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May/June of that year. After 14 weeks in the Top 40, it became the UK&#x27;s third best-selling single of 2000. In 2001, after the success of &quot;It Feels So Good&quot; she announced that she planned to retire from the world of DJing to focus on her singing career. After finishing the album &quot;Born to Be Free&quot;, Sonique did return to DJing on a few special occasions.

===2002–2006: &quot;On Kosmo&quot;===
In 2004, Sonique announced she was working on an album called &quot;On Kosmo&quot;. The first single was &quot;Another World&quot;, which reached number 57 in Germany when released in 2004. &quot;Why&quot; (released Spring 2005), reached number 90 in Germany.

&quot;Alone&quot; was selected as the third single with which the album would be launched, but when the album got pushed back from the expected release date of February 2006, the single was cancelled. When the new release date of 29 September 2006 was announced, the track &quot;Sleezy&quot; was chosen as the single with which the album was to be released. However, &quot;Sleezy&quot; was also cancelled when the release date was pushed back once again. When &quot;On Kosmo&quot; was finally released, on Monday 13 November 2006, it failed to chart significantly in the UK. Nevertheless, Sonique was shown as a celebrity guest at 2006 edition of the World Music Awards, in London.

===2007–present===
In 2007, when promotional work for her previous album, &quot;On Kosmo&quot;, was finished, Sonique announced she would continue touring Europe despite the flop of the album. A teaser from some of the new material she had been working on, entitled &quot;Better Than That&quot;, &#x27;leaked&#x27; online on 5 October 2008. Due to the positive reception of this &#x27;leak&#x27;, the track was posted available to download on various legal MP3 download sites.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2009, for which she underwent surgery at a London clinic. Following her operations, Sonique opted to receive 5 months of chemotherapy in an effort to prevent a recurrence. She was given the all clear in 2010 and celebrated by appearing on a cover version of the Cyndi Lauper song &quot;Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot;, which was released to raise funds for the Cancer Research UK charity.

The single &quot;World of Change&quot; was released on 23 October 2009 and the official video was posted by Sonique&#x27;s label on YouTube.

The year 2011 brought the release of the album &quot;Sweet Vibrations&quot;, which contains the previously released singles &quot;Better Than That&quot; and &quot;World of Change&quot;.

In March 2024 Sonique sold out her own show at the Royal Festival Hall with special guests Baby-D and Rozalla and added a string-section and choir to her band.

On 27 June 2024, Sonique performed a DJ set on the Silver Hayes stage at the Glastonbury Festival.

<doc id="1292123" wikidata="Q6942253" url="?curid=1292123" title="Music of Rhode Island">
<text>Rhode Island, a state of the United States in the New England region, is known for a diverse and thriving music scene.

==History==
In 1733, the first organ said to be designed for church use, was installed at Trinity Church in Newport.

In the late 1990s, the state&#x27;s music scene, which is centered around the capital city of Providence, became nationally known for the noise rock scene that revolved around the Fort Thunder artists&#x27; collective.

The state is home to a wide range of artists performing of a number of genres, most notably folk rock, jazz, hardcore punk, hip hop, and Cape Verdean music.

The state is known for the famous Newport Jazz and Newport Folk festivals.

==State song==
In 1996, Rhode Island declared &quot;Rhode Island, It&#x27;s for Me&quot; as the official state song. The lyrics were written by Charlie Hall, the music was written by Maria Day, and the piece was arranged by Kathryn Chester. &quot;Rhode Island, It&#x27;s for Me&quot; replaced &quot;Rhode Island&quot;, which was subsequently named the official state march.

== Other state-affiliated songs ==

=== &quot;Rhode Island&quot; ===

==== About ====
“Rhode Island&quot;, written by T. Clarke Browne, was the official state song for over 50 years, when it was replaced by &quot;Rhode Island, It’s For Me&quot;. It has since been renamed the official state march.

==== Lyrics ====
The following are the lyrics for the song &quot;Rhode Island&quot;:

=== &quot;Rhode Island Is Famous for You&quot; ===

==== About ====
“Rhode Island Is Famous for You&quot; was originally written by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz in 1948, for &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;, a 1940s Broadway show about the U.S. States. The number was performed by Estelle Loring, who was awarded a Theater World Award for the piece, and Jack Haley.

“Rhode Island Is Famous for You&quot; also served as the theme song for Buddy Cianci&#x27;s Radio Show, and was performed by Robert Goulet and Cianci himself at his 1995 mayoral inauguration.

The song has been covered by Blossom Dearie, Michael Feinstein, Nancy LaMott, Mandy Patinkin, John Pizzarelli, and Erin McKeown.

The song has recently been featured on the podcast &quot;Crimetown&quot;.

==Popular music==

===Providence===
Providence, the state&#x27;s capital, has a very strong local independent music scene, known especially for its contributions to the genre of noise rock, most notably the groups Lightning Bolt, Daughters, Black Dice, and Arab on Radar. Rap artists such as Sage Francis and John Phelps, formerly known as Lunchbagg, are among the notable figures combining DIY philosophy with Hip Hop. Other rap artists such as Dee Gomes, Jae Lynx, King OSF, J Duce, and Vick Mucka have grown prominent fan bases by representing the city&#x27;s harsher neighborhoods and have gone on to sign with major record labels.

Other indie rock and alternative artists from the city include Les Savy Fav, Dicky Barrett (vocalist for ska group Mighty Mighty Bosstones), ZOX, The Low Anthem, Downtown Boys, and Deer Tick. Noise/Punk 5 piece, Hairspray Queen are also from varying neighborhoods in the City.

Singer-songwriter, musician, and lyricist Jeffrey Osborne was born and raised in Providence. Osborne spent over a decade as the drummer and lead vocalist for the American R&amp;B/funk band L.T.D. Among his biggest hits with the group were &quot;(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again&quot; (1977), &quot;Concentrate on You&quot;, &quot;Love Ballad&quot; (1976), and &quot;Holding On (When Love Is Gone)&quot; (1978). Osborne subsequently launched a successful solo career in 1982, charting with hit songs including &quot;On the Wings of Love&quot;, &quot;I Really Don&#x27;t Need No Light&quot; (No. 29 and No. 39, respectively, on the pop chart), &quot;Don&#x27;t You Get So Mad&quot; (No. 25), &quot;Stay with Me Tonight&quot; (No. 30), &quot;Plane Love&quot; (No. 10 R&amp;B, No. 6 dance), and &quot;We&#x27;re Going All the Way&quot; (No. 48).

Based in Providence, the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the most influential music institutions in the state.

==== College Hill ====
Rhode Island School of Design has been the &quot;alma mater&quot; of many popular musicians. Three members of Talking Heads met at the college, but did not form the band until they moved to New York City.

Notable musicians who attended Providence&#x27;s Brown University include Wendy Carlos, Lisa Loeb, Mary Chapin Carpenter, OK Go singer Damian Kulash, Duncan Sheik, ZOX, Lawrence, and Will Oldham, who dropped out after one semester.

===Newport===
Newport has a much smaller scene, with Throwing Muses being its most successful rock band. The group formed in 1981 and recorded and toured until their hiatus in 2003. The band&#x27;s lead guitarist and secondary songwriter, Tanya Donnelly also formed Belly, best known for their hit &quot;Feed the Tree&quot;, which went to No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart in 1994. Donnelly was also briefly guitarist for The Breeders.

The singing family The Cowsills, who had Top 40 hits from 1967 to 1969 also are from Newport. They were the inspiration for the fictional Partridge Family.

Since 2000, Newport has cultivated a small ska punk scene, headed by the Sublime cover group Badfish and the punk band Big World.

Rockabilly singer Jody Gibson (née Joseph Paul Katzberg), who had a Gold Record with &quot;Good Morning Captain&quot;, spent much of his later life in Newport.

===Rest of the state===
Other well known Rhode Island musical artists from elsewhere in the state include John Cafferty, Blu Cantrell (who had a No. 2 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up Style (Oops!)&quot; in 2001), Combustible Edison, Sage Francis, Monty Are I, Draco and the Malfoys, and Billy Gillman. The pop music producer and songwriter Dr. Luke was born in Westerly.

==Other music==

===Indigenous music===
===Portuguese music===
Due to the large population of Portuguese immigrants in Southern New England, Portuguese traditional music is played in small communities. Usually Roman Catholic churches are the center of the communities activities, where music is played.

Fado, which has been compared with the Spanish flamenco, is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a characteristic sentiment of resignation, fatefulness, and melancholia (loosely captured by the word saudade, or &quot;longing&quot;). Fado performers play at local venues throughout Rhode Island and Southern Massachusetts.

The Azores is the major heritage of many Portuguese-Americans. In Rhode Island, most Portuguese traditional music is played by Azorean people. Azoreans maintain some distinct musical traditions, such as the traditionally fiddle-driven chamarrita dance. This dance and music is played mainly at weddings and Church festivals.

Azorean-Portuguese sensation Jorge Ferreira is a popular musician throughout New England, singing at many festivals and events.

===Cape Verdean music===
Of special importance is the music of the large Cape Verdean population. Although Cape Verdean music is largely unknown outside of the expatriate community, Rhode Island is the acknowledged center for Cape Verdean morna and other styles in the United States.

==Music festivals==

===Newport Jazz Festival===
The Newport Jazz Festival began in 1954 by George Wein and has been documented on recordings by Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Muddy Waters, Nina Simone, Ray Charles, John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. The 1958 festival was documented in the 1960 film &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;. The festival moved to New York City in 1971. In 1985, the festival was revived in Newport as a JVC Jazz Festival.

===Newport Folk Festival===
The Newport Folk Festival began in 1959, co-founded by Jazz Festival founder George Wein. The festival is best known for the July 25, 1965 performance of Bob Dylan, where he performed for the first time with electric instruments. Like the Jazz Festival, the folk festival moved to New York City in 1971, but returned in 1986. Notable performers at the festivals included: Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Bob Dylan, Buffalo Springfield, Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens, Bonnie Raitt, Alison Krauss, Ry Cooder, Little Feat, Janis Ian, Suzanne Vega, Violent Femmes, The String Cheese Incident, Indigo Girls, and The Pixies.

===Newport Music Festival===
The Newport Music Festival is a classical music festival that began in 1969 as a summer season of the Metropolitan Opera. The outdoor venue was not conducive to classical music performance, and instead the grand rooms of the stately Newport mansions were put to use for chamber music concerts. The early concerts used many members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Mark P. Malkovich, III has been the general director for 31 of the 37 seasons. It has become known for giving young international artists, such as Inessa Galante, a venue for their American debut.

===Sunset Music Festival===
The Sunset Music Festival began in 1997 in Newport and has included performances by acts as varied as Saves the Day, Jason Mraz, Paula Cole, moe., Little Feat, Jack&#x27;s Mannequin, Peter Frampton, Bo Bice, Bruce Hornsby, Guster, Something Corporate, Ben Folds (who has played at several festivals), Better Than Ezra, Cheap Trick, Gin Blossoms and Anna Nalick and also local artists like Becky Chace, Zox, and Monty Are I.

<doc id="1292142" wikidata="Q7098942" url="?curid=1292142" title="Optimal experimental design">
<text>In the design of experiments, optimal experimental designs (or optimum designs) are a class of experimental designs that are optimal with respect to some statistical criterion. The creation of this field of statistics has been credited to Danish statistician Kirstine Smith.

In the design of experiments for estimating statistical models, optimal designs allow parameters to be estimated without bias and with minimum variance. A non-optimal design requires a greater number of experimental runs to estimate the parameters with the same precision as an optimal design. In practical terms, optimal experiments can reduce the costs of experimentation.

The optimality of a design depends on the statistical model and is assessed with respect to a statistical criterion, which is related to the variance-matrix of the estimator. Specifying an appropriate model and specifying a suitable criterion function both require understanding of statistical theory and practical knowledge with designing experiments.

==Advantages==
Optimal designs offer three advantages over sub-optimal experimental designs:
#Optimal designs reduce the costs of experimentation by allowing statistical models to be estimated with fewer experimental runs.
#Optimal designs can accommodate multiple types of factors, such as process, mixture, and discrete factors.
#Designs can be optimized when the design-space is constrained, for example, when the mathematical process-space contains factor-settings that are practically infeasible (e.g. due to safety concerns).

==Minimizing the variance of estimators==
Experimental designs are evaluated using statistical criteria.

It is known that the least squares estimator minimizes the variance of mean-unbiased estimators (under the conditions of the Gauss–Markov theorem). In the estimation theory for statistical models with one real parameter, the reciprocal of the variance of an (&quot;efficient&quot;) estimator is called the &quot;Fisher information&quot; for that estimator. Because of this reciprocity, minimizing&quot; the &quot;variance corresponds to maximizing&quot; the &quot;information.

When the statistical model has several parameters, however, the mean of the parameter-estimator is a vector and its variance is a matrix. The inverse matrix of the variance-matrix is called the &quot;information matrix&quot;. Because the variance of the estimator of a parameter vector is a matrix, the problem of &quot;minimizing the variance&quot; is complicated. Using statistical theory, statisticians compress the information-matrix using real-valued summary statistics; being real-valued functions, these &quot;information criteria&quot; can be maximized. The traditional optimality-criteria are invariants of the information matrix; algebraically, the traditional optimality-criteria are functionals of the eigenvalues of the information matrix.

*A-optimality (&quot;average&quot; or trace)
**One criterion is A-optimality, which seeks to minimize the trace of the inverse of the information matrix. This criterion results in minimizing the average variance of the estimates of the regression coefficients.
*C-optimality
**This criterion minimizes the variance of a best linear unbiased estimator of a predetermined linear combination of model parameters.
*D-optimality (determinant)
**A popular criterion is D-optimality, which seeks to minimize |(X&#x27;X)−1|, or equivalently maximize the determinant of the information matrix X&#x27;X of the design. This criterion results in maximizing the differential Shannon information content of the parameter estimates.
*E-optimality (eigenvalue)
**Another design is E-optimality, which maximizes the minimum eigenvalue of the information matrix.
*S-optimality
**This criterion maximizes a quantity measuring the mutual column orthogonality of X and the determinant of the information matrix. 
*T-optimality
**This criterion maximizes the discrepancy between two proposed models at the design locations.

Other optimality-criteria are concerned with the variance of predictions:
*G-optimality
**A popular criterion is G-optimality, which seeks to minimize the maximum entry in the diagonal of the hat matrix X(X&#x27;X)−1X&#x27;. This has the effect of minimizing the maximum variance of the predicted values.
*I-optimality (integrated)
**A second criterion on prediction variance is I-optimality, which seeks to minimize the average prediction variance &quot;over the design space&quot;.
*V-optimality (variance)
**A third criterion on prediction variance is V-optimality, which seeks to minimize the average prediction variance over a set of m specific points.

===Contrasts===
In many applications, the statistician is most concerned with a &quot;parameter of interest&quot; rather than with &quot;nuisance parameters&quot;. More generally, statisticians consider linear combinations of parameters, which are estimated via linear combinations of treatment-means in the design of experiments and in the analysis of variance; such linear combinations are called contrasts. Statisticians can use appropriate optimality-criteria for such parameters of interest and for contrasts.

==Implementation==
Catalogs of optimal designs occur in books and in software libraries.

In addition, major statistical systems like SAS and R have procedures for optimizing a design according to a user&#x27;s specification. The experimenter must specify a model for the design and an optimality-criterion before the method can compute an optimal design.

==Practical considerations==
Some advanced topics in optimal design require more statistical theory and practical knowledge in designing experiments.

===Model dependence and robustness===
Since the optimality criterion of most optimal designs is based on some function of the information matrix, the &#x27;optimality&#x27; of a given design is &quot;model dependent&quot;: While an optimal design is best for that model, its performance may deteriorate on other models. On other models, an &quot;optimal&quot; design can be either better or worse than a non-optimal design. Therefore, it is important to benchmark the performance of designs under alternative models.

===Choosing an optimality criterion and robustness===
The choice of an appropriate optimality criterion requires some thought, and it is useful to benchmark the performance of designs with respect to several optimality criteria. Cornell writes that

Indeed, there are several classes of designs for which all the traditional optimality-criteria agree, according to the theory of &quot;universal optimality&quot; of Kiefer. The experience of practitioners like Cornell and the &quot;universal optimality&quot; theory of Kiefer suggest that robustness with respect to changes in the &quot;optimality-criterion&quot; is much greater than is robustness with respect to changes in the &quot;model&quot;.

====Flexible optimality criteria and convex analysis====
High-quality statistical software provide a combination of libraries of optimal designs or iterative methods for constructing approximately optimal designs, depending on the model specified and the optimality criterion. Users may use a standard optimality-criterion or may program a custom-made criterion.

All of the traditional optimality-criteria are convex (or concave) functions, and therefore optimal-designs are amenable to the mathematical theory of convex analysis and their computation can use specialized methods of convex minimization. The practitioner need not select &quot;exactly one&quot; traditional, optimality-criterion, but can specify a custom criterion. In particular, the practitioner can specify a convex criterion using the maxima of convex optimality-criteria and nonnegative combinations of optimality criteria (since these operations preserve convex functions). For &quot;convex&quot; optimality criteria, the Kiefer-Wolfowitz equivalence theorem allows the practitioner to verify that a given design is globally optimal. The Kiefer-Wolfowitz equivalence theorem is related with the Legendre-Fenchel conjugacy for convex functions.

If an optimality-criterion lacks convexity, then finding a global optimum and verifying its optimality often are difficult.

===Model uncertainty and Bayesian approaches===
====Model selection====

When scientists wish to test several theories, then a statistician can design an experiment that allows optimal tests between specified models. Such &quot;discrimination experiments&quot; are especially important in the biostatistics supporting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, following the work of Cox and Atkinson.

====Bayesian experimental design====

When practitioners need to consider multiple models, they can specify a probability-measure on the models and then select any design maximizing the expected value of such an experiment. Such probability-based optimal-designs are called optimal Bayesian designs. Such Bayesian designs are used especially for generalized linear models (where the response follows an exponential-family distribution).

The use of a Bayesian design does not force statisticians to use Bayesian methods to analyze the data, however. Indeed, the &quot;Bayesian&quot; label for probability-based experimental-designs is disliked by some researchers. Alternative terminology for &quot;Bayesian&quot; optimality includes &quot;on-average&quot; optimality or &quot;population&quot; optimality.

==Iterative experimentation==
Scientific experimentation is an iterative process, and statisticians have developed several approaches to the optimal design of sequential experiments.

===Sequential analysis===

Sequential analysis was pioneered by Abraham Wald. In 1972, Herman Chernoff wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs, while adaptive designs were surveyed later by S. Zacks. Of course, much work on the optimal design of experiments is related to the theory of optimal decisions, especially the statistical decision theory of Abraham Wald.

===Response-surface methodology===

Optimal designs for response-surface models are discussed in the textbook by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias, and in the survey of Gaffke and Heiligers and in the mathematical text of Pukelsheim. The blocking of optimal designs is discussed in the textbook of Atkinson, Donev and Tobias and also in the monograph by Goos.

The earliest optimal designs were developed to estimate the parameters of regression models with continuous variables, for example, by J. D. Gergonne in 1815 (Stigler). In English, two early contributions were made by Charles S. Peirce and Kirstine Smith.

Pioneering designs for multivariate response-surfaces were proposed by George E. P. Box. However, Box&#x27;s designs have few optimality properties. Indeed, the Box–Behnken design requires excessive experimental runs when the number of variables exceeds three.
Box&#x27;s &quot;central-composite&quot; designs require more experimental runs than do the optimal designs of Kôno.

===System identification and stochastic approximation===

The optimization of sequential experimentation is studied also in stochastic programming and in systems and control. Popular methods include stochastic approximation and other methods of stochastic optimization. Much of this research has been associated with the subdiscipline of system identification.
In computational optimal control, D. Judin &amp; A. Nemirovskii and Boris Polyak has described methods that are more efficient than the (Armijo-style) step-size rules introduced by G. E. P. Box in response-surface methodology.

Adaptive designs are used in clinical trials, and optimal adaptive designs are surveyed in the &quot;Handbook of Experimental Designs&quot; chapter by Shelemyahu Zacks.

==Specifying the number of experimental runs==
===Using a computer to find a good design===
There are several methods of finding an optimal design, given an &quot;a priori&quot; restriction on the number of experimental runs or replications. Some of these methods are discussed by Atkinson, Donev and Tobias and in the paper by Hardin and Sloane. Of course, fixing the number of experimental runs &quot;a priori&quot; would be impractical. Prudent statisticians examine the other optimal designs, whose number of experimental runs differ.

===Discretizing probability-measure designs===
In the mathematical theory on optimal experiments, an optimal design can be a probability measure that is supported on an infinite set of observation-locations. Such optimal probability-measure designs solve a mathematical problem that neglected to specify the cost of observations and experimental runs. Nonetheless, such optimal probability-measure designs can be discretized to furnish approximately optimal designs.

In some cases, a finite set of observation-locations suffices to support an optimal design. Such a result was proved by Kôno and Kiefer in their works on response-surface designs for quadratic models. The Kôno–Kiefer analysis explains why optimal designs for response-surfaces can have discrete supports, which are very similar as do the less efficient designs that have been traditional in response surface methodology.

==History==
In 1815, an article on optimal designs for polynomial regression was published by Joseph Diaz Gergonne, according to Stigler.

Charles S. Peirce proposed an economic theory of scientific experimentation in 1876, which sought to maximize the precision of the estimates. Peirce&#x27;s optimal allocation immediately improved the accuracy of gravitational experiments and was used for decades by Peirce and his colleagues. In his 1882 published lecture at Johns Hopkins University, Peirce introduced experimental design with these words:

Logic will not undertake to inform you what kind of experiments you ought to make in order best to determine the acceleration of gravity, or the value of the Ohm; but it will tell you how to proceed to form a plan of experimentation.
[...] Unfortunately practice generally precedes theory, and it is the usual fate of mankind to get things done in some boggling way first, and find out afterward how they could have been done much more easily and perfectly.
Kirstine Smith proposed optimal designs for polynomial models in 1918. (Kirstine Smith had been a student of the Danish statistician Thorvald N. Thiele and was working with Karl Pearson in London.)

<doc id="1292166" wikidata="Q7886301" url="?curid=1292166" title="Ultimate Soccer Manager">
<text>Ultimate Soccer Manager (USM) is an association football management video game series for MS-DOS, Amiga, and Windows 95, produced by Impressions and distributed by Sierra from 1995 to 1999. The game was a massive hit in Europe (except in Germany, where it was worse received due to some similarities with managers produced by local software houses such as Software 2000 and Ascaron), although it gained little support in Japan. 

The series was noted for its micromanagement, where the player had to do the job of the team manager and much of that of the chairman, from player training up to bank balance management. Other well-known features were to bung an opposing team for preferential market treatment, rig or betting on the outcome of the players&#x27; team matches. Interviews after the match where some answers were printed with different interpretations on the next days&#x27; newspaper (the player could reply a question about the game with &quot;It was a game of two halves&quot;, and &quot;He amazed us after the game by giving us an insight into the rules of football&quot; would be printed on the newspapers).

In all three games, the game always kept the same visual style: the main screen is a bird&#x27;s eye view of the stadium facility (where clicking on the grass brings the squad selection screen or in the stands for the stadium builder) and all screens are presented like the player was inside an office (&quot;TCM 2004&quot; used a similar interface option). To increase the feeling of &quot;being there&quot;, tables are accessed via teletext, news from a newspaper and fixtures are available by clicking on a sheet attached to a clipboard.

While improving with each game, most features were the same from the start of the series. While similar in name, it has no relations with &quot;Ultimate Soccer&quot;.

==Ultimate Soccer Manager==

The original version of the game provided the English league system from the FA Premier League down to the Football Conference. It was distributed as shareware, with a fully functional demo in which the player could only select then Second Division side Brighton and Hove Albion. The game allowed to watch games in top-down view, buy and sell players, manage the team, upgrade the stadium and manage commercial interests such as advertising and merchandise.

The game received a rating of 83% from Amiga computing. The review stating the game&#x27;s graphic approach and coverage of business issues made it stand out in the crowded football management simulation market. The graphics the game used for actual matches, however, were considered poor. PC Format magazine gave the PC version of the game an 85% and a &quot;silver award,&quot; claiming the game was &quot;user-friendly and original&quot; and said it was the &quot;best [football management] game yet,&quot; while Amiga Format also gave the game an 85%.

In 1996, a data disk for the Amiga version was released, covering the 1995-1996 season.

==Ultimate Soccer Manager 2==

The second version of the game, USM 2 ran in protected mode, featured a more polished interface (plus teams and players of the 1996-1997 season and also the French and German leagues (although in the latter the final name of the players had a letter swapped to avoid legal problems regarding licensing) which could be accessed with different executables. In Germany, a localized version of the game was released under the name &quot;DSF Fussball Manager&quot;, DSF being a well-known German TV sports channel.

==Ultimate Soccer Manager 98==

This version of the game was updated to run natively on Windows 95 and Windows 98 and included teams, players and statistics from the 1997-1998 season. The number of leagues increased to five, as both Italian and Scottish championships were added. Transfers required often a week or more of fax exchange between clubs and with the player agent, making the game more realistic than most other games in this aspect, which only required the player to bid for the player and agree on wage and length, adding him instantaneously to the team. USM 98 was released as &quot;DSF Fussball Manager 98&quot; for the German market.

An update disk (also available as a stand-alone) named &quot;Ultimate Soccer Manager 98-99 Season Update Add-on&quot; was sold shortly after the game came out with statistics for the 1998-1999 season, which also included both Spanish and Dutch top two divisions, increasing the number to seven playable leagues. While several bugs were ironed (such as a giving one of the assistants a wage of £99&#x27;999&#x27;999, and then after offering him a new contract he would start &quot;paying&quot; the club around £13M weekly, a glitch that carried from USM 2), it became clear that many teams would allow their superstar players to end contract, allowing the player to pick them for free (although with a large salary). Similarly, you could loan a big-name player worth millions and then use him as a makeweight in transfer deals.

As the official pre-game editor included in the game was poor, some USM users produced enhanced pre-game editors. &quot;USM Data Editor (USMDE or UDE)&quot;, of which the official web site was included in the USM Online web site (usm.footymanager.net), was called as the best editor. USMDE includes various features for USM98 editing, e.g., creating players, editing hidden stats, add-on file support for easy data update by USM fans, beta-released save game editing.

A 1999 update was released, which received a score of 79 from French review magazine Joystick.

==USM 2000==
There was a planned 2000 version of the game, which was developed. However, the game was thought to be scrapped after Sierra UK became impatient with the game&#x27;s development progress. The game was set to have an &quot;all-new 3D match engine with advanced Artificial Intelligence&quot;. It is also believed that the coding was rewritten.

==Updates (2012–present)==

After posting on a Facebook group dedicated to the game, Ande Pearson and Dane Smallbone decided to work together to update all player and team data for the 2012–13 season. The data file was made available to download from the Facebook group titled &#x27;Ultimate Soccer Manager Update&#x27;. As the update proved popular, they have since updated the player and team data up to and including the 2017–18 season and introduced up-to-date sponsors and advertisers to the game.

A community of developers and gamers also discovered the presence of a hidden cheat menu. They release a small application named &quot;USM Tweaker&quot; allowing to alter some behaviors in the game, like preventing to be fired or pausing the transfer of players.

==Technical issues==
The game sometimes crashes when is played for a large number of in-game seasons. The problems with savegames include: no possibility of viewing detailed info on some players (the game quits after double-clicking on player&#x27;s name), wrong statistics about some players (ex. incorrect information about scored goals etc.) or even an unexpected exit of the game after viewing post-match statistics. These problems could be countered by the player making a lot of savegames. The game does not run properly on Windows XP, unless a Windows 98 emulator is used.

<doc id="1292174" wikidata="Q6942194" url="?curid=1292174" title="Music of Montana">
<text>Montana is the 41st state to enter the United States, and has a culturally-diverse population representing a broad spectrum of music genre, style, and instrumentation.

Due to its migration patterns and place in the American West, Montana has a heritage of pioneer folk music and cowboy songs and poetry. The state also has a tradition of baroque, classical, and romantic era music: two prominent musical institutions, both classical, are the Great Falls Symphony Orchestra, which was established in 1958, and the Bozeman Symphony Orchestra, which was established in 1963. The Helena Symphony was founded in 1955 and is known to be one of the premier symphonies of Montana and the Northwest. The Billings Symphony and Chorus is the premier symphony in Montana, performing for the community throughout the year. 

Montana has two official state songs: &quot;Montana&quot; and &quot;Montana Melody.&quot;

==Native American music==

Montana is home to several Indian reservations and traditionally to more than two dozen distinct tribes, each with their own forms of music. These include the Blackfeet, Crow, Flathead, Cheyenne, Chippewa-Cree, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, and Sioux. An example of the modern synthesis of popular and traditional Native music in Montana is Jack Gladstone, a folk musician and lecturer/presenter who embraces Native themes, and who has collaborated with fellow Montana musician Rob Quist.

==Popular Music &amp; Musicians==
Montana country musicians include Rob Quist, formerly of the Mission Mountain Wood Band. The Bridger Creek Boys , of Bozeman, are a Bluegrass band that were finalists at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival&#x27;s 2007 Best New Band Contest.

Other popular musicians from Montana include Seattle&#x27;s Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament (who attended the University of Montana), and guitarist/producer Steve Albini. Grunge pioneer Bruce Fairweather is also from Montana.

Rock and roll musician Chan Romero of Billings is the writer of &quot;Hippy Hippy Shake&quot;, a song that was often performed by The Beatles and was a hit for The Swinging Blue Jeans.

Another well known band includes Helena and Missoula&#x27;s The Skoidats, who recorded on New York City&#x27;s Moon Ska label in the late 1990s. 

Lead singer Colin Meloy and members of the Portland band The Decemberists are from Montana, and were in a band named after the small town of Tarkio, in Mineral County. Meloy graduated from the University of Montana in 1998. Seattle&#x27;s Modest Mouse lead singer Isaac Brock was born in Helena. 

Country singer Doug Adkins was born in Havre. Country singer Randy Rhoads was born in Wolf Point, Montana and lived in Malta throughout most of his career as a recording artist for Blue Ridge Records. He appeared on TNN&#x27;s &quot;Nashville Now&quot; with Ralph Emery twice.

John Mayer visited and fell in love with Livingston, where he bought a house and re-settled in the spring of 2012. His album &quot;Paradise Valley&quot; is named for where he lives in Montana and features country music influences.

One of Montana&#x27;s favorite modern era rock bands is Dawghouse from Helena.
Jared Blake, Nashville singer/songwriter, finalist from season 1 of &quot;The Voice&quot;, sings about the beautiful Montana Skies in his song &quot;Oak Tree&quot; and the video was filmed in Montana.

<text>Al-Asr (, &quot;The Declining Day, Eventide, The Epoch, Time&quot;) is the 103rd chapter (sūrah) of the Qur’ān, the Muslim holy book. It contains three &quot;āyāt&quot; or verses. Surat al-‘Asr is the third shortest chapter after Al-Kawthar and Al-Nasr, being shorter than Al-Nasr by only two words in the 3rd verse.&quot;
:۝ By the afternoon;
:۝ verily man employeth himself in that which will prove of loss:
:۝ except those who believe, and do that which is right; and who mutually recommend the truth, and mutually recommend perseverance unto each other.

==Summary==
*1-2 Men generally seek for gain and find loss
*3 The righteous, however, are the exception to this rule 

== Text and meaning ==

===Text and transliteration===
;Hafs from Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud


¹ 

² 

³ 
;Warsh from Nafiʽ al-Madani


¹ 

² 

³ 

=== Meaning ===

By Al-&#x27;Asr (the time).
Verily! Man is in loss,
Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth (i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma&#x27;ruf) which Allah has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar) which Allah has forbidden), and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allah&#x27;s Cause during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad, etc.).
----
By time,
Indeed, mankind is in loss,
Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.
----
By (the Token of) Time (through the ages),
Verily Man is in loss,
Except such as have Faith, and do righteous deeds, and (join together) in the mutual teaching of Truth, and of Patience and Constancy.
----
By the declining day,
Lo! man is a state of loss,
Save those who believe and do good works, and exhort one another to truth and exhort one another to endurance.
----
==Timing and contextual background of revelation==
Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is an earlier &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, instead of later in Medina.

According to some, it follows sūrah 94 in the chronological order of the Quran.

==Theme and subject matter==
This sura teaches that all human beings are in loss, except those who have &quot;iman&quot; (faith in Islam), do righteous deeds and remind others of the Haqq (truth, rights, reality) and remind others of Sabr (patience).

The text of the Sura can be translated as the following:

1.|وَالْعَصْرِ‌

By time (it explain that God swears By time).

2. 

Indeed man is in loss,

3. ‌

except those who have faith and do righteous deeds, and enjoin one another to [follow] the truth, and enjoin one another to patience.

==Importance==
This sura is considered the summary of whole Quran by almost all notable classical and modern Islamic scholars including Imam Shafi, Ibn Kathir, Israr Ahmed and Farhat Hashmi.
*Ibn Kathir, a traditional exegete, holds that this sura is a warning to believers not to waste time or they could be humiliated or even ruined.
*Imam Shafi, a jurist and traditional scholar of Islam, held that if God had only revealed this surah it would have been sufficient for the guidance of all humankind. It summarized the very essence of the Qur&#x27;anic message. Thus, Imam Shafi’i asserts that if one followed its counsel, it was enough for humankind to achieve success in life.
*Sayyid Qutb, a modern exegete of the Qur&#x27;an, asserts that this surah outlines a complete system for human life based on an Islamic viewpoint. He says that it defines, in the clearest and most concise form, the basic concept of faith in the context of its comprehensive reality. He further says that he is gravely shocked to see the loss and ruin in which humanity finds itself. He is critical of Muslims and non-Muslims and particularly witnessing that humankind is turning away from the goodness that God has bestowed upon it. He is confident that the guidance of this surah is what made the early Muslim great as it can do for those that follow it in the long history of humanity. He says that once the early Arabs were aroused by such surahs, they quickly burst the bounds of Arabia and zealously worked toward the salvation of humanity.
* Al-Tabarani: when humankind finds itself at a loss; it can revive itself by returning to the formula provided by the third verse and the four principles/conditions, which are adhered to as a foundation. We saw how these four principles operated on both physical and spiritual levels. This is probably the reason why the companions of the Prophet did not want to become heedless of the foundational message of Islam. Consequently, they used to meet one another and only depart until one of them recited surat-Al-Asr to the other and they bid peace upon one another.

<text>Venezuela is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. Oil was discovered in the early 20th century and, today, Venezuela has the world&#x27;s largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world&#x27;s leading exporters of oil. Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis. Inflation peaked at 100% in 1996. As (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak. The recovery of oil prices in the early 2000s gave Venezuela oil funds not seen since the 1980s. A destabilized economy led to a crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, resulting in hyperinflation, an economic depression, shortages of basic goods and drastic increases in poverty, disease, child mortality, malnutrition, and crime.

His works include the film &quot;Who&#x27;s the Caboose?&quot; (1997) as well as the television shows &quot;Beat Cops&quot; (2001) and &quot;Pilot Season&quot; (2004). He also appeared in &quot;Next Stop Wonderland&quot; (1998) and made guest appearances on &quot;Spin City&quot; (1997), &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2000), &quot;America Undercover&quot; (2005), and &quot;Maron&quot; (2015). Since 2010, he has hosted a daily political talk show, &quot;The Majority Report with Sam Seder&quot;. He also voices Hugo, a recurring character on the animated comedy series &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;.

==Early life==
Seder was born to a Jewish family in New York City, and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, and is the oldest of three children. His father, J. Robert Seder, is a well-known lawyer in Worcester. Seder earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Religious Studies from Connecticut College and enrolled at Boston University School of Law. Disillusioned by the school&#x27;s commercialized culture, he dropped out of studying law to pursue a career in comedy. Seder became involved in the Boston comedy scene, associating with Janeane Garafalo, David Cross, Marc Maron and Sarah Silverman, whom he dated. These connections were used in his first film, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Caboose?&quot;, which then led to Seder&#x27;s appearances on comedy TV shows.

==Career==
In March 2004, Seder became co-host of Air America Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Majority Report&quot;, alongside Janeane Garofalo until July 2006. 

During Mark Green&#x27;s restructuring plan to transform Air America into a profitable leader in progressive talk radio, called &quot;Air America 2.0&quot;, &quot;The Sam Seder Show&quot; was canceled on April 13, 2007, and replaced by WOR Radio Network late night radio show host Lionel. Seder was relegated to a Sunday show entitled &quot;Seder on Sunday&quot;. Lionel soon lost two-thirds of Seder&#x27;s live affiliates and listenership. The final &quot;Seder on Sunday&quot; was broadcast on June 1, 2008.

Seder also occasionally substituted for Randi Rhodes when Rhodes was on Air America, as well as Mike Malloy on &quot;The Mike Malloy Show&quot; on the Nova M Radio network. In 2008 he also began a collaboration with Marc Maron on &quot;Maron v. Seder&quot;, an hour-long video webcast. In January 2009, &quot;Maron v. Seder&quot; was renamed &quot;Breakroom Live with Maron &amp; Seder&quot; and aired live from the kitchen in the Air America offices weekdays. Seder and Maron also hosted a post-show chat with viewers after each episode. Air America Media cancelled &quot;Breakroom Live with Maron &amp; Seder&quot; in July 2009. In 2010, Air America was shut down.

In November 2009, Seder hosted a pilot for NBC of an American version of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. Three years later, in November 2012, it was announced Seder would again be the host of an American version of the show, this time on TBS.

In November 2010, Seder began an independent online podcast, called &quot;The Seder Channel&quot; (later renamed &quot;The Majority Report w/Sam Seder&quot;). The live talk-show format closely matches the previous Air America program, with politically oriented commentary by Seder and co-hosts, and interviews with various guests. Seder offers listeners different tiered levels of access to content around the show via crowdfunding platform Patreon.

In late 2010, Seder began occasionally serving as substitute host of &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; when Olbermann was on vacation. In December 2010, Seder also became co-host of the nationally syndicated progressive radio interview program &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, co-hosted by Farron Cousins and Florida-based attorney Mike Papantonio.

Seder also worked as a political contributor for MSNBC.

&quot;The Majority Report&quot; was associated with the TYT Network, with which the show partnered, from the 2010 relaunch until 2020, which generally followed its original format but was rebooted as a viewer-funded production. Following those structural affiliation and funding-production changes, the show won a string of international People&#x27;s Choice Podcast Awards, in five of the next seven annual competitions (2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017), for the &quot;News and Politics&quot; award.

=== 2017 tweet controversy ===
In 2009, to criticize petitions seeking Roman Polanski&#x27;s release from rape charges, Seder tweeted &quot;Dont care re Polanski, but i hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene&quot;. In 2017, Mike Cernovich called attention to the tweet and contacted multiple journalists asking them to write about it. As a result, MSNBC initially decided not to renew Seder&#x27;s contract despite Seder explaining that the tweet was satire. Shortly afterward, MSNBC reversed its decision after getting pushback from journalists, and MSNBC&#x27;s president said the initial decision to part ways had been wrong.

==Personal life==
On August 9, 2005, Seder&#x27;s wife Nicole Cattell gave birth to their first child, daughter Myla Rae. On March 7, 2013, she gave birth to their second child, son Saul.

On April 27, 2018, Seder announced that the couple were separated.

<text>Zoltán Tildy (; 18 November 1889 – 3 August 1961), was an influential leader of Hungary, who served as prime minister from 1945 to 1946 and president from 1946 until 1948 in the post-war period before the seizure of power by Soviet-backed communists.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===

Zoltán Tildy was born in Losonc (Lučenec now in Slovakia), in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the family of a Hungarian official in the local government. He took a degree in theology from the Reformed Theological Academy in Pápa, afterwards spending a year studying at Assembly&#x27;s College, Belfast, in Ireland. Tildy served as an active minister of the Reformed Church beginning in 1921, and edited the daily paper of the Reformed church in Hungary, the Keresztény Család (Christian Family), as well as other periodicals. In 1929, Tildy joined the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party (FKgP) with other noted Hungarian political figures, including Ferenc Nagy. He became executive vice-president of the organization soon afterwards.

He married Erzsébet Gyenis (1896–1985) in 1916 and had three children: Zoltán Tildy, Jr. (1917–1994), Erzsébet Tildy (1918–2012), and László Tildy (1921–1983).

===Political career and later life===

Tildy was elected to the Hungarian parliament in 1933, being reelected in 1936 and 1939. He put pressure on Horthy&#x27;s government to pull out of the Second World War. After Hungary was occupied by the Germans, Tildy was forced into hiding. When the Soviets occupied Hungary and drove out the Germans, Tildy became leader of the FKgP and was appointed Prime Minister of Hungary, serving from 15 November 1945 until 1 February 1946, when he was elected President of Hungary. Tildy was an ex officio member of the High National Council from 7 December 1945 until 2 February 1946.

Serving as the first President of the Republic of Hungary when he was forced to resign in July 1948 after allegations emerged about his son-in-law being arrested for corruption and adultery. Tildy was held under house arrest in Budapest until May 1, 1956. He was appointed to the position of a state minister in the coalition government during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, and was eventually arrested by Soviet forces after the revolution was crushed by Warsaw Pact intervention. On 15 June 1958 Tildy was sentenced by the Supreme Court to six years&#x27; imprisonment, in the trial of Imre Nagy and associates. However, he was released under an individual amnesty in April 1959 in view of his advanced years (in fact due to illness). He then lived in complete retirement until he died in Budapest on 3 August 1961.

<doc id="1292220" wikidata="Q6942210" url="?curid=1292220" title="Music of New Mexico">
<text>New Mexico is a state of the Southwest United States. The state has music traditions dating back to the ancient Anasazi and Pueblo people, Navajo, Apache, and the Spanish Santa Fe de Nuevo México; these old traditions are found in both their original folk forms and as a modern folk genre known as New Mexico music.

During the 1940s, the town of Clovis was home to the Norman Petty Studios, where Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, and Waylon Jennings recorded. A well-known 1960s group hailing from New Mexico was The Fireballs scoring a #1 Hot 100 hit in 1963 called &quot;Sugar Shack&quot;. Native American rock group Xit were signed and recorded &quot;Plight of the Redman&quot; (1972) and &quot;Silent Warrior&quot; (1973) for a subsidiary of Motown Records, Rare Earth Records. During the 1970s and 80s, New Mexico musicians Al Hurricane and Al Hurricane Jr. became recognized on the nationally and internationally syndicated &quot;Val De La O Show&quot;.

The English-language state song of New Mexico is &quot;O Fair New Mexico&quot;, adopted by the state legislature in 1917. In 1971, &quot;Así Es Nuevo México&quot; was adopted as the Spanish-language state song. In 1989, the legislature adopted &quot;Land of Enchantment&quot; by Michael Martin Murphey as the official state ballad; and in 1995, the legislature adopted &quot;New Mexico - Mi Lindo Nuevo México&quot; by Pablo Mares as the state&#x27;s official bilingual state song.

== History ==

New Mexico&#x27;s heritage studies and inquiries into the unique past of the area reveal that the violin was introduced into New Mexico long before Europeans brought polka and other folk forms to the east coast; several studies confirm the long history of violin playing in New Mexico. The New Mexico Musical Heritage Project continues to play the music of early New Mexico, while learning the violin building techniques used in the pueblos to convert the natives through music.

The first inhabitants of New Mexico were Native Americans, followed by Spaniards in the sixteenth century. In 1821 the land was ceded to Mexico, and in 1848 it became a territory of the United States. The cultures of each of these groups has influenced the music of New Mexico in unique ways.

== Genres ==
=== Native American music ===

Native American music has wide representation in New Mexico, as the state is home to the second largest Native American population percentage in the US. One such example is Taos Pueblo&#x27;s Robert Mirabal who received two Grammy Awards. An entirely unique genre of Latin music, directly related to the Pueblo, mestizo Hispano, and other Native affiliated groups, called New Mexico music has a sizable audience in the state.

=== New Mexico music ===

Pioneered by the ancient Pueblo people, and by the folk music of Hispanos of New Mexico. Artists such as Antonia Apodaca and Al Hurricane popularized the genre, with Al Hurricane blending Country, Western, Rock, and Jazz into the sound. Modern Latin Pop musicians Lorenzo Antonio and Sparx have continued to crossover New Mexico with other popular music styles. The largest radio market in the state, Albuquerque, has two major FM stations primarily broadcasting the genre, those being KANW and KNMM. There are several annual series&#x27; of albums, including; KANW&#x27;s &quot;New Mexico Music&quot; series, &quot;New Mexico Spanish Super Stars&quot;, and &quot;Los 15 Grandes de Nuevo México&quot;.

=== Orchestral and classical music ===
The New Mexico Philharmonic continues the long tradition of the now defunct New Mexico Symphony Orchestra, who had been performing since 1932. Other Classical music institutions in the state include the Taos School of Music, the Santa Fe Community Orchestra and the Santa Fe Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.

=== Country music ===
In the formative era of modern country music, many notable figures passed through New Mexico. Around 1927, Bob Wills lived in Roy, New Mexico where he was influenced by contemporary Hispanic dancehall styles. Between 1954 and 1960, a young Glen Campbell was living in Albuquerque and performing for live audiences and his uncle, Dick Bills&#x27;, radio program. Contemporary performers of County and Western music residing in New Mexico include Michael Martin Murphey of Red River and Handsome Family of Albuquerque, who relocated from Chicago in 2001.The town of Ruidoso is home to the Lincoln County Cowboy Symposium - now known as CowboyFest - which features music.

=== Rock music ===
From 1954 through the -60s, a recording studio operated by Norman Petty in Clovis was responsible for several notable Buddy Holly tracks. In 2002, a song called &quot;New Slang&quot; was heard on TV commercials across the country. The group was The Shins, which became a perennial favorite among indie folk/pop/rock fans worldwide. The next international success came when a young Santa Fe and Albuquerque resident Zach Condon formed an ethno/world influenced band called Beirut.

== Music festivals ==
The city of Santa Fe, New Mexico is home to the Santa Fe International Festival of New Music, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, and the Santa Fe Opera. Taos is home to the Taos Solar Music Festival. June is the month for many festivals in New Mexico. Besides Taos Solar Music Festival at the end of June, there is Southwest Roots Music Festival, also called the Thirsty Ear Music Festival that takes place in the middle of June just outside Santa Fe at the famous western movie set. Festival features well-known artists representing the roots of folk, blues, bluegrass, and world music.

The University of New Mexico&#x27;s John Donald Robb Composers’ Symposium has been and continues to be one of the central contemporary music events in the US Southwest. The symposium began in 1972 when UNM Music Professor William Wood invited his former teacher, Norman Lockwood, to the campus, where his compositions were performed, along with the works of UNM music composition students. In 1999, the symposium was renamed the John Donald Robb Composers’ Symposium. The symposium is now presented jointly by the John Donald Robb Musical Trust and the UNM Department of Music. The Symposium brings international composers and performers to the University of New Mexico campus for four to six long days of concerts, seminars, masterclasses, and public talks. The numerous concerts and events are all made free to the public, making the Symposium an inclusive listening opportunity that welcomes in audiences and serves them entirely new sonic experiences, as well as showcasing the talents of UNM faculty and students, alongside national and international guest artists. Guest composers have included Robert Ashley, Milton Babbitt, Anthony Braxton, Martin Bresnick, John Cage, Raven Chacon, Chen Yi, Michael Colgrass, George Crumb, Julio Estrada, Lukas Foss, Lou Harrison, Alan Hovhaness, Karel Husa, John Harbison, Ernst Krenek, Libby Larsen, Lei Liang, John Lewis, Thea Musgrave, Pauline Oliveros, Hilda Paredes, Vincent Persichetti, Roger Reynolds, Ned Rorem, Maria Schneider, Gunther Schuller, Cecil Taylor, James Tenney, Joan Tower, Christian Wolff.
Directors of the Symposium include: Christopher Shultis, Peter Gilbert, and Karola Obermüller.

Another festival in New Mexico is Globalquerque taking place at the end of every September since 2005 at the Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque. It features music from all continents (folk/ethno/pop) as well as some Native American and Hispanic acts.

=== Small venues ===

<text>The TAAS, or Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, was the third standardized test used in Texas between 1991 and 2002, when it was replaced by the TAKS test from 2003 to 2013. It was used from grades 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Passing the Grade 11 level was required for graduation, but many opportunities for retesting were available. The implementation of the TAAS was the first time a state-mandated exam was required to be passed for graduation. There were many alternative routes available for students unable to pass the TAAS.

The TAAS tested 3 areas of proficiency: reading, writing, and math. The math and reading sections consisted of multiple-choice, while the writing section consisted of a series of prompts for which essays had to be written.

In 2002, researchers Jere Confrey and David Carrejo presented a paper that criticized the TAAS. They found that the &quot;data provided to teachers for instructional decision-making&quot; did not always reconcile with &quot;published test structure&quot;.

<doc id="1292239" wikidata="Q1546830" url="?curid=1292239" title="Gurn">
<text>A gurn or chuck is a distorted facial expression and a verb to describe the action. A typical gurn involves projecting the lower jaw as far forward and up as possible and covering the upper lip with the lower lip.

The English Dialect Dictionary, compiled by Joseph Wright, defines the word &quot;gurn&quot; as &quot;to snarl as a dog; to look savage; to distort the countenance,&quot; while the Oxford English Dictionary suggests the derivation may originally be Scottish, related to &quot;grin&quot;. In Northern Ireland, the verb &quot;to gurn&quot; means &quot;to cry,&quot; and crying is often referred to as &quot;gurnin&#x27;.&quot; Originally the Scottish dialectical usage refers to a person who is complaining. The term &quot;gurn&quot; may also refer to an involuntary facial muscular contortion experienced as a side-effect of MDMA consumption.

== Gurning contests ==
Gurning contests are a rural English tradition. They are held regularly in some villages, with contestants traditionally framing their faces through a horse collar — known as &quot;gurnin&#x27; through a braffin&quot;.

The World Gurning Championship takes place annually at the Egremont Crab Fair. The fair dates back to 1267, when King Henry III granted it a Royal Charter. The origins of the gurning competition itself are unclear, and it may not be so old, although it was described as an ancient tradition by local newspaper &quot;The Cumberland Paquet&quot; in 1852.

Those with the greatest gurn capabilities are often those with no teeth, as this provides greater room to move the jaw further up. In some cases, the elderly or otherwise toothless can be capable of gurns covering the entire nose.

Peter Jackman became England&#x27;s best-known gurner, winning the world championship four times, beginning in 1998 with a face called the &quot;Bela Lugosi&quot;. He made numerous TV appearances, including an appearance on &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;. He had his teeth removed in 2000 to make his features easier to manoeuvre.

The only male gurner to win the world title 15 times is Tommy Mattinson (UK), who took the top prize at the World Gurning Championship in 1986–87 and then 10 times between 1999 and 2010.

Anne Woods won the women&#x27;s world title 28 times.

<doc id="1292241" wikidata="Q1752938" url="?curid=1292241" title="World Chess Solving Championship">
<text>The World Chess Solving Championship (WCSC) is an annual competition in the solving of chess problems (also known as chess puzzles) organized by the World Federation for Chess Composition (WFCC), previously by FIDE via the Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions (PCCC).

The participants must solve a series of different types of chess problem in a set amount of time. Points are awarded for correct solutions in the least amount of time. The highest score at the end of the competition is proclaimed the winner.

==Format==
The Tournament consists of six rounds over two days, with three rounds each day according to the following table:
*Round 1 – 3 twomovers 20 minutes solving time
*Round 2 – 3 threemovers 60 minutes solving time
*Round 3 – 3 endgame studies 100 minutes solving time
*Round 4 – 3 helpmates 50 minutes solving time
*Round 5 – 3 moremovers 80 minutes solving time
*Round 6 – 3 selfmates 50 minutes solving time

==Sections==
*Team Championship – To qualify as an official team world championship, there must be at least seven teams from seven countries present. This section has grown from nine teams in 1977 to now averaging 20.
*Individual – Likewise, for an official individual world championship to take place, 30 solvers from at least 10 countries must participate. This number too has grown from 18 in 1977 to well over 70 in the past six years (as of 2007).
*Women and Juniors (up to 23 years old) – This event only requires 10 solvers from at least seven countries.

==Rating==

===Formulas===
We assume that the tournament has n solvers, with ratings formula_1 (i = 1, ..., n) and in the tournament their scores are formula_2 (i = 1, ..., n). 
*AveRat = average rating of the solvers
*AveSco = average score of the solvers 
*VarRat = formula_3
*Covar = covariance between ratings and scores = formula_4
*Slope = formula_5
*Intercept = formula_6

For players who didn&#x27;t already have a rating, a preliminary rating is calculated. This rating is determined at the end of the first tournament in which the solver has participated. The formula that is used to calculate this rating is: 
*preliminary rating = formula_7

For players who already have a rating, the new rating is calculated as follows. 
*Rat = most recent rating of the solver
*ExpSco = formula_8
*TC = tournament coefficient, a number between 1 and 4; when the tournament is stronger, the TC is higher 
*ChangeRat = formula_9
*NewRat = new rating = formula_10

These formulas are the defaults. If parameters fall outside a predetermined range, correction calculations are being carried out. These can be found in the reference.

<text>Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man is the first studio album by American rock band the Bob Seger System, released in 1969. The original title was &quot;Tales of Lucy Blue&quot;, hence the cover art. In the liner notes, Bob Seger says (sarcastically) he later realized Lucy Blue was &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot;, and so changed the title of the album. He then thanks &quot;Doctor Fine&quot; for this realization. (Doctor Fine being the person who made Seger change the album&#x27;s name.) The original cover design for the album featured the nude figure from Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;, but this too was changed for the final release.

The title track was also performed on Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band&#x27;s live album &quot;Live Bullet&quot;.

<doc id="1292252" wikidata="Q503720" url="?curid=1292252" title="Andrew Bergman">
<text>Andrew Bergman (born February 20, 1945) is an American screenwriter, film director, and novelist. His best-known films include &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, &quot;The In-Laws&quot;, &quot;The Freshman&quot; and &quot;Striptease&quot;.

==Early life==
Born to a Jewish family, Bergman graduated from Binghamton University in 1965 and earned a PhD in American history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1970.

His dissertation, a study of Depression-era Hollywood films, was published in 1971 by NYU Press under the title &quot;We&#x27;re in the Money: Depression America and Its Films&quot;. He also wrote &quot;James Cagney: The Pictorial Treasury of Film Stars&quot;.

==Career==
===Screenwriting===
Bergman broke into the film industry by writing the original screenplay (titled &quot;Tex X&quot;) that served as the basis for Mel Brooks&#x27;s classic &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), and was among the writers who adapted it into its final state. He was later the sole creator of the TV sitcom pilot adaptation called &quot;Black Bart&quot; starring Louis Gossett Jr. for CBS which aired only once on April 4, 1975. The production was only a contractual requirement by Warner Bros. in order to maintain movie rights to produce future sequels. Mel Brooks did not have any involvement.

He wrote a gangster film &quot;Rhapsody in Crime&quot; that was never made. Warner Bros approached him to write a sequel to &quot;Freebie and the Bean&quot; with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin. Instead, Bergman came up with &quot;The In-Laws&quot; (1979).

===Director===
&quot;The In-Laws&quot; was a success, so Bergman could direct his next script, &quot;So Fine&quot; (1981) starring Ryan O&#x27;Neal. It was a box office disappointment.

Bergman wrote &quot;Oh, God! You Devil&quot; (1984) and &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985) starring Chevy Chase. The latter was a big hit. Less successful was &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (1986), the final film to be directed by John Cassavetes. In 1987, The Lobell/Bergman Company, which was a joint venture with producer Michael Lobell, had signed a first-look deal at Universal Pictures to handle film production of various movies.

&quot;New York&quot; magazine in 1985 dubbed him &quot;The Unknown King of Comedy.&quot;

He wrote and directed &quot;The Freshman&quot; (1990) starring Marlon Brando and Matthew Broderick and did a rewrite on &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991). He executive produced a number of movies including &quot;Chances Are&quot; (1989), &quot;White Fang&quot; (1991), &quot;Undercover Blues&quot; (1993) and &quot;Little Big League&quot; (1994).

Bergman wrote and directed &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (1992) starring Nicolas Cage, James Caan and Sarah Jessica Parker, and directed &quot;It Could Happen To You&quot; (1994) starring Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda.

He wrote the initial draft for &quot;The Scout&quot; (1994), although he says the resulting film is different from his version. The film gives writing credit to Roger Angell, Bergman, Monica Johnson and star Albert Brooks.

Bergman wrote and directed &quot;Striptease&quot; (1996) starring Demi Moore, and directed the Jacqueline Susann biopic &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Great&quot; (2000) starring Bette Midler and Nathan Lane.

He has written four novels: &quot;The Big Kiss-Off of 1944&quot;, &quot;Hollywood and LeVine&quot;, &quot;Tender Is LeVine&quot;, and &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot;. The first three are hard-boiled noir detective stories about a Jewish private eye called Jack LeVine (originally Jacob Levine) in 1940s New York. The fourth is a psychological study of a Jewish family. He also wrote the Broadway comedy, &quot;Social Security&quot;, and &quot;Working Title&quot;. The Andrew Bergman History Writing Prize is awarded by the University of Wisconsin.

===Theatre===
His first play on Broadway, &quot;Social Security&quot;, opened in 1986, starring Marlo Thomas and Ron Silver.

In 2013, Bergman would go on to adapt his movie and write the book for the &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; Broadway musical, with music and lyrics by Jason Robert Brown.

==Awards==
In 2007, Bergman received the Ian McLellan Hunter Award for Lifetime Achievement in Writing from the Writers Guild of America.

For his work on &quot;Striptease&quot;, Bergman received the Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and shared the Worst Picture Award with co-producer Mike Lobell.

==Personal life==
He lives in New York City with his wife. He has two grown sons.

<text>City status is a symbolic and legal designation given by a monarch, national or subnational government. A municipality may receive city status because it already has the qualities of a city, or because it has some special purpose.

Historically, city status was a privilege granted by royal letters of patent. Sovereigns could establish cities by decree, e.g. Helsinki, regardless of what was in the location beforehand. Also, with the establishment of federal governments, the new capital could be established from scratch, e.g. Brasília, without going through organic growth from a village to a town.

Historically, British city status was often conferred on settlements with a diocesan cathedral; in more recent times towns apply to receive city status by letters patent at times of national celebration. Similarly, city status in Italy is granted by decree of the President (and before 1946 by the King of Italy) in recognition of historical, cultural or demographic merit. In the United States &quot;city&quot; can be used for much smaller settlements. 

The Government of China in 1982–1997 upgraded many counties to cities by decree, thereby increasing their city count from 250 to more than 650 during this period. Almost 15% of the counties in China became cities. The new &quot;cities&quot; may include large rural areas as well as urban areas. The upgrade was considered desirable by local governments because the new status provides additional powers of taxation and administration, the right to expand the size of government, and an increase in the proportion of land which could be converted from agriculture to buildings.

<text>Utricularia vulgaris (greater bladderwort or common bladderwort) is an aquatic species of bladderwort found in Asia and Europe. The plant is free-floating and does not put down roots. Stems can attain lengths of over one metre in a single growing season, but die back and form turions in winter. The leaves are finely pinnately divided, between one and eight centimetres long and carry many bladder-like traps. The yellow flowers are borne on stalks above the surface of the water between April and August. In eastern Asia and North America, its place is taken by the related species &quot;U. macrorhiza&quot;.

<doc id="1292269" wikidata="Q5060634" url="?curid=1292269" title="Central Conference of American Rabbis">
<text>The Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), founded in 1889 by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, is the principal organization of Reform rabbis in the United States and Canada. The CCAR is the largest and oldest rabbinical organization in the world. Its current president is Rabbi Erica Asch.

Rabbi Hara Person is the Chief Executive.

==Overview==
The CCAR bylaws state that “the purpose of this Conference shall be to preserve and promote Judaism and to encourage all efforts for the dissemination of its teachings in a Liberal spirit; to advance the cause of Jewish learning; to foster fellowship and cooperation among rabbis and other Jewish scholars; and to serve the welfare of its members.”

Membership primarily consists of rabbis educated at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. The CCAR also offers membership to those who have graduated in Europe from the Leo Baeck College in London (United Kingdom) and the Abraham Geiger College at the University of Potsdam, and other rabbis who joined the Reform movement after being ordained and met the membership criteria.

The CCAR issues responses to religious questions for Reform Judaism known as responsa, as well as resolutions, and platforms. In keeping with the principles of Reform Judaism, their positions are non-binding on individual rabbis or congregations. It is also the publisher of &quot;CCAR Journal&quot;, a journal of Reform Judaism published quarterly. The group also runs the CCAR Press, a publishing house for Reform Judaism that publishes the movement&#x27;s prayer books as well as a variety of publications about contemporary Jewish life.

== Platforms ==
From time to time the CCAR publishes platforms that are intended to layout the contemporary framework for North American Reform Judaism. 

The publication of platforms began in 1885 with the Declaration of Principles, later known as the Pittsburgh Platform, which established Reform Judaism in North America, and built upon the founding ideas of Reform Judaism in Germany. While written before the CCAR was formally founded, the meeting was declared the continuation of the Philadelphia Conference of 1869, which was the continuation of the German Conference of 1841 to 1846.

In 1937 the Columbus Platform was approved as the first official platform of the American Reform movement. 

The CCAR continues to rewrite platforms as Reform Judaism evolves:

* 1976 &quot;Centenary Perspective&quot; 
* 1997 &quot;Reform Judaism &amp; Zionism: A Centenary Platform&quot; known as “The Miami Platform” 
* 1999 &quot;A Statement of Principles for Reform Judaism&quot;

== Reform Rabbinic Voice ==
As the largest organization of liberal rabbis in the world, the CCAR frequently comments on pressing issues of the day through public statements and resolutions. 

Some examples include: 

* In 1964, the CCAR began to take an official position opposing the American war in Vietnam, and in 1972 it began to refuse to pay the federal excise tax on telephone service as a protest against that war.
* In 1983, the CCAR took one of its most controversial stands and formally affirmed that a Jewish identity can be passed down through either the mother or the father, if the child is raised with a Jewish identity.
* In 2014, the CCAR joined a lawsuit challenging North Carolina&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage, which was America&#x27;s first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans.
* In 2023, the CCAR passed a resolution advocating for the rights of transgender people in response to a national right wing movement to remove rights and a significant uptick in violence against transgender people, stating &quot;these attacks threaten the most vulnerable among us and challenge our Reform Jewish values. Their consequences are alarming—including the appalling murder rates of transgender people and the high rates of suicidal ideation and suicide among trans youth.[6] By contrast, we know that an affirmative, proactive encouragement of gender diversity can make a positive difference.&quot;
* In 2024, the CCAR issued a joint statement with other Reform Movement institutions about the war between Israel and Hamas, stating &quot;In this darkest of times, we remain committed to a resolution of the conflict that will ensure Israel&#x27;s security and allow for Palestinian self-determination and self-governance...Further, the widespread distrust of the Palestinians and their leadership in both Gaza and the West Bank, as well as deep Palestinian mistrust of Israel&#x27;s leadership, will require significant efforts by the Israelis, Palestinians, regional neighbors, and the international community to make such a resolution a viable reality. A successful and peaceful Palestinian entity remains vital to ensuring Israel&#x27;s long-term security. For these reasons, we are deeply dismayed by Prime Minister Netanyahu&#x27;s recent comments dismissing the possibility of a future peaceful Palestinian state.&quot;
* In 2024, the CCAR passed a resolution against book bans stating that &quot;Book bans often represent attempts to erase vulnerable individuals and communities—and to silence marginalized voices—which has happened to Jews repeatedly throughout history. &quot; 

== Leadership ==
The CCAR is led by a volunteer president who is elected from among members as well as a paid professional executive. 

=== Notable Leadership ===
In 2003, Rabbi Janet Marder became the first female president of the CCAR; this made her the first woman to lead a major rabbinical organization and the first woman to lead any major Jewish co-ed religious organization in the United States.

In 2015, Denise Eger became the first openly gay president of the CCAR.

In 2018, Rabbi Hara Person became the first woman to be the chief executive of the CCAR. 

== Rabbinic Ethics ==
The Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) has an ethics code which all members are required to uphold, and an ethics committee to handle complaints and discipline any member rabbi found to be in violation of the code. This system only holds jurisdiction over rabbis who are part of the CCAR as it is a voluntary membership organization. While the vast majority of CCAR rabbis have not faced accusations of ethics violations, instances of serious misconduct such as financial impropriety, plagiarism, theft, and sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, have occurred in the past. Historically, these matters were dealt with privately, often resulting in minimal repercussions for the offending rabbis.

At the annual convention in June 1991, recognizing the need for a more formalized approach, the CCAR adopted an Ethics Code and Ethics Committee with the aim of safeguarding congregants and communities from problematic behavior by rabbis. This committee was granted the authority to discipline rabbis, including the possibility of permanent suspension or expulsion. However, despite this step forward, investigations remained slow, and many offending rabbis faced little to no public consequences for their actions, often receiving private reprimands. 

A 1996 report by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) shed light on the sluggish investigative process and the lack of meaningful consequences for offending rabbis. This led to public criticism and increased scrutiny of the CCAR&#x27;s handling of ethical issues within its ranks. Subsequent cases, such as the expulsion of a CCAR member rabbi in 2015 for sexual misconduct, further underscored these concerns. For example, in 2014, a senior rabbi of a Texas synagogue was reprimanded for sexual misconduct and allowed to move to another senior rabbi position in North Carolina, where he was censured for sexual misconduct within 36 months of his new placement, and neither congregation was alerted to the allegations.

In 2015, Rabbi Denise Eger was elected president of the CCAR. The first openly LGBTQ person to hold this prominent role, Rabbi Eger made ethics a central focus of her presidency. In 2018, Rabbi Hara Person became the first woman to be the chief executive of the CCAR and also pushed for higher ethical standards and accountability.

In 2021, the organization voluntarily commissioned a legal firm to review its ethics processes and propose improvements. This initiative resulted in several recommendations, including increased transparency regarding ethical infractions and a formal apology issued by the CCAR in September 2022, that included the following language: 

&quot;With sincerity of heart and intention, the CCAR apologizes for the hurt that our organization and our ethics system have caused. We acknowledge that there have been times when we failed to meet our own high standards and we are deeply sorry. We apologize, and we are committed to working diligently for a better future.&quot; 

While these efforts have been praised by many, some critics argue that they do not go far enough to address underlying issues within the ethics system. For instance, concerns have been raised about the continued use of lay investigators and the reliance on fellow rabbis to determine the fitness of an offender to return to their role. However, similar practices are commonplace in other professional organizations in the United States such as the National Association of Social Workers, the American Psychological Association, and the American Bar Association.

Despite ongoing challenges, the CCAR remains committed to enhancing its ethics process and now provides annual progress reports about the ethics system.

<doc id="1292280" wikidata="Q869433" url="?curid=1292280" title="Court and Spark">
<text>Court and Spark is the sixth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. Released by A&amp;M in January 1974, it infuses the folk rock style of her previous albums with jazz elements.

It was an immediate commercial and critical success—and remains her most successful album. It reached No. 2 in the United States and No. 1 in Canada and eventually received a double platinum certification by the RIAA, the highest of Mitchell&#x27;s career. It also reached the Top 20 in the UK and was voted the best album of the year for 1974 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll. In 2020, it was ranked at number 110 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

In 2004, &quot;Court and Spark&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Mitchell did not release a new album in 1973, the first year she had not done so in her professional career. Her previous offering, &quot;For the Roses&quot;, was released in November 1972 to critical and commercial success, and Mitchell decided to spend the whole of the next year writing and recording a new album that revealed her growing interest in new sounds—particularly jazz. During 1973 her stage appearances were fewer than in previous years. She performed in April in a benefit concert at the Sir George Williams University Auditorium and then appeared live again in August, twice at The Corral Club, accompanied by Neil Young.

Mitchell spent most of 1973 in the recording studio creating &quot;Court and Spark&quot;. Mitchell and engineer Henry Lewy called in a number of top L.A. musicians to perform on the album including members of the Crusaders, Tom Scott&#x27;s L.A. Express, cameos from Robbie Robertson, David Crosby and Graham Nash and even a twist of comedy from Cheech &amp; Chong.

==Release and reception==
On December 1, 1973, Asylum Records released a single, her first in over a year, &quot;Raised on Robbery&quot;. The single reached No. 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Singles Chart in February 1974. In January 1974, &quot;Court and Spark&quot; was released, and met with widespread critical acclaim and commercial success. Its success was reaffirmed when the follow-up single, &quot;Help Me&quot;, was released in March. It received heavy radio airplay and became Mitchell&#x27;s first and only top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; single, peaking at No. 7 on the Hot 100 in the first week of June, and reaching No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

&quot;Court and Spark&quot; became a big seller that year, peaking at No.2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and staying there for four weeks. The album topped the US Cashbox and Record World charts for one week each.

In a July 1979 interview with Cameron Crowe for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Mitchell recounted playing the newly completed &quot;Court and Spark&quot; to Bob Dylan, during which he fell asleep. She later suggested that Dylan was probably trying to be &quot;cute&quot; in front of label boss David Geffen, who was also present.

Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks recalled taking LSD to the album: &quot;I was with my producer, at his house, with a set of speakers that were taller than that fireplace, and I was in a safe place. And I sat there on the floor and listened to that record… That was a pretty dynamic experience.&quot;

In 2000 it was voted number 116 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Honors==
* RIAA certifications: gold February 27, 1974; platinum and double platinum December 12, 1997.
* In 1974, &quot;Court and Spark&quot; was voted the &#x27;Best Album of the Year&#x27; in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll.
* It was voted number 116 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).
* In 2003, the album was ranked number 111 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 114 in a 2012 revised list, and 110 in a 2020 revised list.

<text>Wellington Regional Stadium (commercially known as [[Sky (New Zealand)|Sky]] Stadium through naming rights) is a major sporting venue in Wellington, New Zealand. The stadium&#x27;s bowl site size is .

The stadium was built in 1999 by Fletcher Construction and is situated close to major transport facilities (such as Wellington railway station) north of the CBD. It was built on reclaimed railway land, which was surplus to requirements.

The stadium also serves as a large-capacity venue for concerts and is known colloquially as &quot;The Cake Tin&quot;.

==History==
The stadium was built in 1999 by Fletcher Construction and was the first bowl stadium built in New Zealand. It was built to replace Athletic Park, which was no longer considered adequate for international events due to its location and state of disrepair. The stadium was also built to provide a larger-capacity venue for One Day International cricket matches, due to the Basin Reserve ground losing such matches to larger stadiums in other parts of the country.

==Naming rights==
Westpac Trust, later known as just Westpac, signed on to be the naming sponsor for the stadium when it opened in 2000. That arrangement continued for twenty years until 31 December 2019. On 22 August 2019, it was announced that Sky had signed a six-year agreement to take over as the naming sponsor of the stadium from 1 January 2020.

==Tenants==

The stadium is a multi-purpose facility, though used mainly for sporting events. It is the home of the Wellington Lions Mitre 10 Cup rugby team and the Hurricanes Super Rugby team. The stadium also hosted the Wellington Sevens, one of the events that was part of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series for national rugby sevens teams. Sky Stadium regularly serves as a home venue for All Blacks rugby matches.

Sky Stadium is also the home venue for A-League team Wellington Phoenix FC, the stadium often referred to as &quot;The Ring of Fire&quot; by Phoenix supporters. It also serves as a major home venue for the New Zealand men&#x27;s national football team (the All Whites), notably hosting the home leg of their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Bahrain.

During the summer the stadium generally hosts international and occasionally domestic limited overs cricket, with the home team being the New Zealand Black Caps for the international contests and Wellington Firebirds for the domestic competition.

The stadium has also been used for rugby league matches, including national team fixtures and New Zealand Warriors away fixtures. The St Kilda Football Club, an Australian rules football club in the Australian Football League (AFL), played home games on Anzac Day at the venue from 2013 to 2015.

Off-field facilities built into the stadium also included the New Zealand Institute of Sport, and a campus for the Wellington School of Cricket, run by the Wellington Cricket Association.

==Events==

In 2000, the then-Westpac Stadium hosted the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. This was the first time the event was hosted outside Edinburgh, Scotland. They returned to Wellington to play at the stadium again in February 2016.

In 2002, during an England versus Black Caps cricket match, director Peter Jackson recorded 30,000 fans chanting in Black Speech for the sound of 10,000 chanting Uruk-hai during the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep in the film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;.

On 4 March 2006, WWE&#x27;s first New Zealand show, WWE SmackDown Road to WrestleMania 22 Tour, was held at the stadium. 23,875 people attended the televised event.

New Zealand hosted the 2008 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup. Six pool matches and two playoff matches were played at the then Westpac Stadium. Due to FIFA rules disallowing host stadia to be named after non-FIFA sponsors, the stadium was officially known as &quot;Wellington Stadium&quot; during the event.

The stadium hosted the national team&#x27;s 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match on 14 November 2009 against Bahrain. New Zealand won the match 1–0, with a record crowd at the time of 35,194 for a football match in New Zealand.

On 28 January 2010, AC/DC kicked off the Australasian leg of its Black Ice World Tour at the stadium. The concert quickly sold out so a second was scheduled for 30 January. The stadium was also a venue for Bon Jovi&#x27;s The Circle Tour in 2010.

The stadium hosted eight games during the 2011 Rugby World Cup including two quarter-final matches.

On 25 April 2013, the stadium hosted the first AFL game outside of Australia for premiership points with St Kilda hosting with Sydney winning by 16 points in front of 22,546 spectators.

On 11 May 2013, the stadium and Wellington hosted its first National Rugby League fixture since 2004 with the Auckland-based New Zealand Warriors hosting the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at the stadium for &#x27;The Capital Clash&#x27;. The Warriors wore their &#x27;Capital Clash&#x27; jerseys which incorporated the black and gold colours of Wellington and a design based on a strip worn by Wellington Rugby league teams in the 1970s. The Warriors lost the game late in the match in front of 28,096 fans.

On 20 November 2013, the stadium hosted the second leg of the World Cup qualification inter-confederation play-off against Mexico, which resulted in New Zealand failing to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

On 15 November 2014, the stadium hosted the 2014 Rugby League Four Nations Final. It was the first Four Nations Final held in New Zealand, though the Mount Smart Stadium in Auckland hosted the inaugural final of the tournament, then known as the Tri-Nations, in 1999.

The stadium was one of the venues for 2015 Cricket World Cup which was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. It hosted a total of four matches during the World Cup which included a quarter-final clash between the hosts New Zealand and West Indies.

Guns N&#x27; Roses performed at the stadium during their Not in This Lifetime... Tour on 2 February 2017.

On 11 November 2017, the stadium hosted its third World Cup qualification inter-confederation play-off with the New Zealand men&#x27;s national football team drawing 0–0 against Peru in front of a new record crowd for a football match in New Zealand of 37,034 fans thanks to extra seating install in the stadium for the match.

<text>A nipper or tile nipper (like a pair of scissors or pliers) is a tool used to &quot;nip&quot; or remove small amounts of a hard material, such as pieces of a tile, which needs to be fitted around an odd or irregular shape.
For tile that requires a straight cut a tile cutter is used. This is a small mechanical device where the tile is placed, aligned and clamped on a platform; lightly &quot;scored&quot; with a cutting wheel and snapped in two with a handled slicer (blade similar to a paper cutter in appearance).
For larger jobs an electric tile saw or wet saw is used; this saw is similar to a small mitre saw except that water is distributed on the saw blade to lessen the effects of heat and friction.

A rail nipper is used in rail transport modelling to cut rail tracks.

<doc id="1292314" wikidata="Q7045341" url="?curid=1292314" title="Noah (The Bob Seger System album)">
<text>Noah is the second studio album by American rock band The Bob Seger System, released in September 1969. Seger was displeased with the album as it was the label&#x27;s intention to showcase Tom Neme as the voice of the band. Seger contemplated quitting music altogether after this album. It has never been reissued on a legitimate U.S. CD by Capitol and probably never will be, as Seger disavows it. It does, however, contain the Seger title song, &quot;Noah&quot;, which was issued as a single in July 1969.

The album features the song &quot;Death Row&quot;, which was a holdover from the &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Gamblin&#x27; Man&quot; sessions. It was originally issued as the B-side of the single &quot;2 + 2 = ?&quot;.

<doc id="1292317" wikidata="Q304640" url="?curid=1292317" title="Chinese Orthodox Church">
<text>The Chinese Orthodox Church (, ) is an autonomous Eastern Orthodox Christian church in China. An organized Orthodox presence was maintained in the region as early as the 17th century as a child of the Russian Orthodox Church, which granted the Chinese Church autonomy in 1957 amidst its ongoing suppression in the Soviet Union.

==Earlier forms of Eastern Christianity==
Christianity is said to have entered China by the apostle Thomas around the year 68 AD, as part of his mission to India. There is also speculative evidence to suggest the missionary of a few Church of the East Assyrian Christians during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220AD).

The earliest archeological evidence of Christianity in China, is from the Church of the East in the seventh century. The Eastern Christianity of that period is commemorated by a stele and the Daqin Pagoda of Xi&#x27;an. Though it was suppressed in the ninth century, Christianity was reintroduced in the 13th century. It again declined rapidly with the coming of the native Chinese Ming dynasty in the 14th century.

==Russian Orthodox mission==

The religious and missionary spirit of the Russian Orthodox church towards China was considerably minimal and was often a low priority compared to strategic, political, and diplomatic interests.

During the 1680s, Siberian Cossacks along with a few Orthodox clerics, created a settlement at Albazin on the Amur River. The Kangxi Emperor considered Albazin within Qing territory so he set out a force of 10,000 troops to assault the Russian garrison there. Most of the Cossacks retreated back to Siberia while 30 joined the Qing army.

After the Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689, along with other concessions, a biannual Russian caravan was allowed to enter Beijing for trade. These trade caravans would soon lead to it being closely knit with the ecclesiastical Russian mission. The mission was at first meant to cater to the Albazinians in Beijing. In the late 1690s, Peter the Great saw Russian trade in Beijing as a potential method to press for Russian interests in China so he sent an Archimandrite priest to China. He also requested that priest and clerics be trained as missionaries and ordered the Metropolite of Kiev to dispatch two or three monks along with a priest to Beijing so that they could learn Chinese. A Russian-Chinese negotiation in 1713 brought the first archimandrite priests to Beijing to cater to Russian merchants and the Albazinians.

The first mission establishment was begun in 1715 at Beijing by an Orthodox archimandrite, Hilarion. This mission is first recorded in the Russo-Chinese Treaty of Kyakhta (1727). Under Sava Vladislavich&#x27;s pressure, the Chinese government conceded to the Russians the right to build an Orthodox chapel at the ambassadorial quarters of Beijing. The mission published four volumes of research in Chinese studies in the 1850s and 1860s. Two clerics became well known for scholarship in the subject, the monk Iakinf and Archimandrite Palladius, who also compiled a dictionary.

===Boxer Rebellion===
The Boxer Rebellion of 1898–1900 targeted foreign missionaries and Chinese converts to Christianity. The mission suffered greatly, and the Boxers burned the mission&#x27;s library in Beijing.

The Orthodox liturgical calendar for June 24 remembers 222 Chinese Orthodox Christians, including Father Mitrophan, who were slaughtered in 1900, as the Holy Martyrs of China.

In spite of the uprising, by 1902, there were 32 Orthodox churches in China with close to 6,000 adherents. The church also ran schools and orphanages.

===Leaders of the Russian mission===

* Father Maxim Leontieff, 1685–1712.
* Archimandrite Hilarion (Lezhaysky), 1715–1728.
* Archimandrite Anthony (Platkovsky), 1729–1735.
* Archimandrite Hilarion (Trusov), 1736–1743.
* Archimandrite Gervasius (Lentsovsky), 1744—1755
* Archimandrite Ambrose (Yumatoff), 1755–1771
* Archimandrite Nicholas (Tsvet), 1771—1781
* Archimandrite Joachim (Shishkovsky), 1781—1794
* Archimandrite Sophronius (Gribovsky), 1794—1807
* Archimandrite Hyacinth (Bichurin), 1806–1821
* Archimandrite Peter (Kamensky), 1821–1830
* Archimandrite Benjamin (Morachevich), 1830—1840
* Archimandrite Polycarp (Tougarinoff), 1840–1849
* Archimandrite Palladius (Kafarov), 1849–1859 and 1864–1878
* Archimandrite Gurias (Karpoff), 1858–1864
* Archimandrite Flavian (Gorodetsky), 1878–1884
* Archimandrite Amphilochius (Loutovinoff), 1883–1896
* Metropolitan Innocent (Figourovsky). Archimandrite 1897–1901, Bishop of Beijing 1902–1921, Archbishop of Beijing and All-China 1922–1928, Metropolitan 1928–1931
* Archbishop Simon (Vinogradov), 1928–1933
* Archbishop Victor (Svjatin), 1933—1956

==Chinese Orthodox Church==
With the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Archbishop Victor set out ambitious plans to continue the work of the Russian mission and Russian leadership, through the expansion of evangelization operations and the creation of new seminaries. Instead, the Moscow Patriarchate ordered Victor to speed up transition the mission into a Chinese church within ten years. However, in the 1950s, resources were stripped as Russia and China were involved in the Korean War, and China saw an exodus of Russian expatriates. The Moscow Patriarchate formally granted autonomy in 1957 to the Chinese Orthodox Church, but transferred mission properties to the Russian and Chinese governments. While now run by Chinese clergy, the eventual Anti-Rightist Campaign posed a difficult time for all Christians, Orthodox or otherwise, and all public religious activity came to an end by the Cultural Revolution in 1966.

==Today==
Since the 1980s, the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China extends official recognition to five religious communities: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism (through the Catholic Patriotic Association) and Protestantism (through the Three-Self Patriotic Movement). However, this recognition has not been extended to the Orthodox Church. Nonetheless in the 2010s tentative steps have been taken between China and Russia to revive the Chinese Orthodox Church.

At present, there are only three communities in Mainland China with regular weekly services and resident clergy. The Beijing community meets at the restored Church of the Dormition in the grounds of the Russian Embassy in Dongzhimen; the Shanghai community at the Russian Consulate; and the Church of the Intercession, Harbin, the only one open to Chinese nationals for regular worship. Elsewhere, priestless congregations continue to meet in Northeast China (in Heilongjiang and elsewhere) and in Western China (Xinjiang – Ürümqi and Ghulja) with, apparently, the tacit consent of the government. There are also Orthodox parishes in the province of Guangdong and in Shanghai; two former Orthodox churches in Shanghai are currently in a process of being returned to the church but no activities are currently held inside them.

In March 2018, the Chinese Orthodox church acquired the government&#x27;s approval to prepare new priests in Russian theological seminaries.

The Orthodox Church operates relatively freely in Hong Kong, where there are two parishes: Saint Luke Greek Orthodox Cathedral (Eastern Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia under the Ecumenical Patriarchate) and the Russian Orthodox parish of Saints Peter and Paul under the Moscow Patriarchate. There is also a presence in Taiwan (where Archimandrite Jonah George Mourtos leads a mission church).

==Orthodox Evenkis==
Although many of them have adopted Tibetan Buddhism, the Evenks of both the Russian Federation and China are Orthodox Christian people. They are one of the Asiatic peoples who practice Orthodox Christianity, which they voluntarily adopted. There are also around 3000 Evenks in neighbouring Heilongjiang.

<text>Speyside is a village in northern Tobago within Saint John Parish. It lies on the leeward coast, across from the island of Little Tobago (for which it is a departure point), 26 km northeast of Scarborough, overlooking Tyrrel&#x27;s Bay. At the census of population in 2000, the town had a population of 1100.

Speyside has some of the best coral reefs on the island of Tobago, and is a popular dive site. The reefs are less disturbed than the more famous Buccoo Reef in southwestern Tobago.

== Infrastructure ==
Speyside is linked to the rest of Tobago by the Windward Road. There is a jetty off the Lucy Vale Road. The town has a high school, Speyside High School, and a health centre, Speyside Health Centre. There are also various hotels and inns as well as a resort, Blue Waters Inn, located on Batteaux Bay.

== Geography ==
Speyside is surrounded by the mountains of Tobago&#x27;s Main Ridge. The surrounding terrain is very hilly and some roads are very steep. The majority of the town is situated on Tyrrel&#x27;s Bay. Goat Island and Little Tobago island are located just offshore. The surrounding waters have some of the best coral reefs on the island of Tobago and the sea between the islands is shallow, which allows for glass bottom boats to make trips to the islands. 

== Diving ==
With some of the best coral reefs in Tobago located just offshore, Speyside is a very popular dive destination. At Kelleston Drain, just off Little Tobago, divers can observe the world&#x27;s largest single brain coral colony. At Japanese Gardens, divers witness the most colourful dive site in Speyside. There are also numerous wrecks just offshore, such as the wreck of the Trinity.

<doc id="1292319" wikidata="Q111200" url="?curid=1292319" title="Adamite">
<text>Adamite is a zinc arsenate hydroxide mineral, Zn2AsO4OH. It is a mineral that typically occurs in the oxidized or weathered zone above zinc ore occurrences. Pure adamite is colorless, but usually it possess yellow color due to Fe compounds admixture. Tints of green also occur and are connected with copper substitutions in the mineral structure. Olivenite is a copper arsenate that is isostructural with adamite and there is considerable substitution between zinc and copper resulting in an intermediate called &quot;cuproadamite&quot;. Zincolivenite is a recently discovered mineral being an intermediate mineral with formula CuZn(AsO4)(OH). Manganese, cobalt, and nickel also substitute in the structure. An analogous zinc phosphate, &quot;tarbuttite&quot;, is known.
==Occurrence==
Adamite occurs as a secondary mineral in the oxidized zone of zinc- and arsenic-bearing hydrothermal mineral deposits. It occurs in association with smithsonite, hemimorphite, scorodite, olivenite, calcite, quartz and iron and manganese oxides.

The yellow to bright lime-green colored crystals and druze along with its distinctive fluorescence make adamite a favorite among mineral collectors. Found in Mapimí, Durango, Mexico; Greece; and California and Utah in the United States.

Adamite was named after the French mineralogist Gilbert-Joseph Adam (1795–1881). It was first described in 1866 for an occurrence at the type locality of Chañarcillo, Copiapó Province, Atacama Region, Chile.

<doc id="1292323" wikidata="Q3148872" url="?curid=1292323" title="Image Fight">
<text>(also IMAGEFIGHT) is a 1988 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and published by Irem. It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine, Sharp X68000 and FM Towns in 1990. The NES version was the only version that was released in North America. It was followed by &quot;Image Fight II: Operation Deepstriker&quot;.

==Plot==
The following is taken directly from the NES instruction manual:

&quot;On a fateful day in 20XX, the Earth&#x27;s moon exploded into four large fragments and a multitude of meteors. Aliens from afar had succeeded in destroying the West&#x27;s moon base. One after another, mankind&#x27;s other military industrial space complexes were being lost. What mankind dreaded had come to pass. Scores of unidentified fighters were in the area. In addition, the moon&#x27;s main computer, still intact after the explosion, had a strange vegetation coiled around it. Their trademark evil exploits being a dead giveaway, invaders from the Boondoggle Galaxy had arrived to take over the Earth. To counter these evil forces, leading scientists from all over the globe created the &quot;OF-1&quot; Fightership. Combat pilots depart the Earth to fend off the invaders and earn everlasting glory&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Image Fight&quot; was released one year after Irem&#x27;s successful horizontal scroller, &quot;R-Type&quot;, and, although not directly related, the two games have some similarities.

The player flies a futuristic red ship. &quot;R-Type Final&quot; identifies this ship as the OF-1 &quot;Daedalus&quot;, but it is not known if that was the ship&#x27;s original name. The term OF-1 does appear in the NES version&#x27;s instruction manual, as well as in the official artwork for the sequel, &quot;Image Fight II&quot;. The game appears to be set inside a holographic simulator, like the holodeck on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. 

The game begins with five stages taking place inside a combat simulation, and the player&#x27;s ability to destroy enemy entities is tested. Upon finishing a simulation stage, the game displays results and shows if their score is considered passing or failing. The player must have an average kill rate of 90% or better in the simulation stages to immediately proceed to real combat. If the player fails, they must play an additional stage before entering real combat. Real combat consists of three stages. The real combat stages play much like a traditional shoot em&#x27; up game, where the player immediately proceeds to the next stage upon completing the current stage.

===Pods===
The defining feature of &quot;Image Fight&quot; is the Pod, a small, coloured sphere with two short gun barrels attached to it. The Pod, once collected, floats alongside the player&#x27;s ship.

There are two different kinds of Pod:
* Red Pod – this changes direction based on the movement of the ship, and can therefore be aimed at enemies. This can be very useful, as enemies can and do attack from any direction.
* Blue Pod – similar to the Red Pod, except it always points forward and the direction cannot be changed. This makes it more powerful in direct confrontations, but less versatile.

The ship can support up to three Pods. The first two Pods collected will take up positions on the left and right sides of the ship; the third Pod hovers behind it.

====Pod Shot====
The Pod Shot is a special attack in which the side Pods are launched forward at high speed, before circling back and returning to the ship. This enables them to be used as projectiles themselves, and thrown at enemies ahead. This attack can be performed with either one or two side Pods; the rear Pod, if present, does not participate.

===Speed control===
The ship has four different levels of speed that the player can switch between, to allow for more precise manoeuvering in confined spaces. The structure of the ship transforms during a speed change, the wings angling down and back at higher speeds.

The ship&#x27;s thrusters exhaust a large blue flame whenever the ship changes speed; this can be used as a weapon to damage or destroy enemies.

===&#x27;Forces&#x27;===
The player can acquire various butterfly-shaped devices that attach to the front of the ship. These are similar in function to the Force in &quot;R-Type&quot;: they turn the player&#x27;s blaster into a powerful laser weapon. They can also act as a weak shield, protecting the ship from impact; this destroys them but leaves the ship intact. Unlike the Force in &quot;R-Type&quot;, they cannot be ejected from the ship; the only way to remove them, in fact, is to have them destroyed. The ship cannot pick up a new device if one is already attached. There are a number of different kinds, each of which provides a different weapon. The weapon names are taken from &quot;R-Type Final&quot;. &quot;R-Type Final&quot; implies that these devices are in fact early versions of what it calls the OF Force, but this may be retroactive continuity.

==Ports and related releases==
The arcade game was also ported for the Nintendo Entertainment System as well as becoming a Japan-only game for the PC Engine, Sharp X68000, and FM Towns in 1990. The PC Engine version was later re-released for the Wii Virtual Console only in Japan. In 1998, &quot;Image Fight&quot;, along with another arcade game by Irem, &quot;X-Multiply&quot;, was released only in Japan as a one-disc double-bill for the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn.

The arcade game was followed by &quot;Image Fight II: Operation Deepstriker&quot;, a sequel for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM² in 1992 exclusively in Japan. Like the PC Engine version of the first game, &quot;Image Fight II&quot; was re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan in 2015 and for the first time in the United States in February 2018 for both games. &quot;Image Fight II&quot; and its PC Engine predecessor also made their European debut in February 2018.

The ship from this game is included in &quot;R-Type Final&quot;, where it is the first in a series of five fighters called the OF series. The Pods are also available on fighters of the OF series.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Image Fight&quot; in their December 15, 1988, issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit among operators surveyed during that two-week period.

==Legacy==
According to producer Hiroshi Iuchi, creator of &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;, &quot;Image Fight&quot; was the main inspiration for &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;″s design. Tomonobu Itagaki, creator of the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; series, listed &quot;Image Fight&quot; as one of his five favorite games. &quot;Image Fight&quot; is also said to be the favorite shooter game of Granzella&#x27;s Kujo Kazuma.

At the head of the sound is the namesake town that is the largest community on the shores of Georgian Bay from Severn Sound to Manitoulin Island.

The following entities are named after this geographic feature:
* Parry Sound District
** Parry Sound, town and seat of Parry Sound District
** Parry Sound, Unorganized, Centre Part, Ontario
** Parry Sound, Unorganized, North East Part, Ontario
* Electoral districts
** Parry Sound (federal electoral district), the federal electoral district from 1904 to 1949

Ben Edmonds called the album &quot;...easily Seger&#x27;s best work to date, but there are still some crucial musical problems he must come to grips with if he is to realize the tremendous potential he displayed on his earlier Cameo-Parkway singles (most notably &#x27;Heavy Music&#x27; and &#x27;Persecution Smith&#x27;).&quot; Edmonds continued: &quot;Seger writes marvelous rock and roll songs in the virile 1965 mold, somewhat of a lost art these days.&quot; The band itself, however, he said, is &quot;like Mountain&quot; and &quot;often degenerates into &#x27;heavy&#x27; overstatements of the most clichéd sort.&quot; Edmonds called &quot;Lucifer&quot; the strongest cut on the album, but his review may have had a dampening effect on sales.

<text>Ste. Rose was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1914, and existed until 2011.

Ste. Rose was located in the southwestern section of the province. It was bordered to the north by Swan River, to the west by Russell, Dauphin-Roblin and Minnedosa, to the south by Turtle Mountain and to the east by Lake Manitoba.

Communities in the riding included Gladstone, Neepawa, McCreary, Ste. Rose, Ste. Rose du Lac and Westbourne.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,038. In 1999, the average family income was $36,883, and the unemployment rate was 7.60%. Much of the riding was farmland and agriculture accounted for 29% of its industry, followed by health and social services at 11%. Twenty-six per cent of Ste. Rose&#x27;s population was aboriginal, and 8% were German. There was once a significant francophone population in this region, and 4% of the riding&#x27;s residents listed themselves as francophone. Over 25% of the population had less than a Grade Nine education, one of the highest rates in the province.

From the 1930s to the 1970s, Ste. Rose was a safe seat for the Manitoba Liberal Party (formerly known as the &quot;Liberal-Progressive Party&quot;). The New Democratic Party held the seat from 1971 to 1986, at which time it was won by Glen Cummings of the Progressive Conservative Party. He held the seat until 2007 when he retired. The riding was won by Progressive Conservative Party candidate Stu Briese.

Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, Ste. Rose was dissolved into the riding of Interlake and the new ridings of Dauphin, and Agassiz. This change took effect for the 2011 election.

<text>Johann Joseph &quot;Hans&quot; Most (February 5, 1846 – March 17, 1906) was a German-American Social Democratic and then anarchist politician, newspaper editor, and orator. He is credited with popularizing the concept of &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; in the United States.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
According to biographer Frederic Trautmann, Johann Joseph Most was born out of wedlock to a governess and a clerk in Augsburg, Bavaria. Most&#x27;s mother died of cholera when he was very young. Most was subjected to physical abuse by his stepmother and a schoolteacher; his aversion to religion earned him more beatings at school. To the end of his life Most was &quot;a militant atheist with the zeal of a religious fanatic&quot; who &quot;knew more Scripture than many clergymen knew&quot;.

Most developed frostbite on the left side of his face as a young child. For several years thereafter, flesh rotted and infection spread, with the primitive medicine of the day unable to treat the condition. His condition worsened and Most was diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a last-gasp measure a surgeon was called in. A two-inch section of his jawbone was removed, resulting in permanent disfigurement.

At the age of twelve, Most organized a strike of students against a particularly hated teacher, resulting in his expulsion from school. This ended Most&#x27;s brief period of formal education, forcing him into the workforce as a youth. Most was apprenticed to a bookbinder, for whom he had to bind books from dawn until sunset, a condition which Most later likened to slavery. At the age of 17 he became a journeyman bookbinder and plied his trade from town to town and job to job, working in 50 cities in 6 countries from 1863 to 1868. In Vienna he was fired and placed on a blacklist for having staged a strike. Unemployable in his trade, he learned to make wooden boxes for hats, cigars, and matches, which he sold on the street until police brought an end to his trade for lacking a license.

=== Political career ===

As the 1860s drew to a close, Most was won over to the ideas of international socialism, an emerging political movement in Germany and Austria. Most saw in the doctrines of Karl Marx and Ferdinand Lassalle a blueprint for a new egalitarian society and became a fervid supporter of Social Democracy, as the Marxist movement was known in the day.

Most engaged himself as editor of socialist newspapers in Chemnitz and Vienna, both were suppressed by the authorities, he also worked as editor of the &quot;Berliner Freie Presse&quot; (Berlin Free Press). Most was a dedicated advocate of revolutionary socialism, sharing the views expressed by Wilhelm Liebknecht in an 1869 speech where he had said; &quot;Socialism cannot be realized within the present state. Socialism must overturn the present state.&quot; In 1873, Most wrote a summary of Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. At Liebknecht&#x27;s request, Marx and Friedrich Engels made some corrections to Most&#x27;s text for a second edition published in 1876, despite the fact that the pair did not believe the pamphlet represented a satisfactory summary of Marx&#x27;s work.

In the 1874 German federal election, Most was elected to represent the Chemnitz constituency as a Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Germany deputy in the Reichstag, in which he served until 1878. Most was repeatedly arrested for his verbal attacks on patriotism, religion, ethics and for his gospel of terrorism, preached in prose and in many songs such as those in his &quot;Proletarier-Liederbuch&quot; (Proletarian Songbook). Some of his experiences in prison were recounted in the 1876 work, &quot;Die Bastille am Plötzensee: Blätter aus meinem Gefängniss-Tagebuch&quot; (The Bastille on Plötzensee: Pages from my Prison Diary).

After advocating violent action, including the use of explosives, as a mechanism to bring about revolutionary change, Most was forced into exile by the government. He first traveled to France but was forced to leave at the end of 1878, settling in London instead. There he founded his own newspaper, &quot;Freiheit&quot; (Freedom), with the first issue coming off the press on January 4, 1879. Convinced by his own experiences of the futility of parliamentary action, Most began to espouse the doctrine of anarchism, which led to his expulsion from the German Social Democratic Party in 1880. In March 1881, Most expressed his delight in the pages of the &quot;Freiheit&quot; over the assassination of Tsar Alexander II of Russia and advocated its emulation; for this Most was imprisoned by British authorities for a year and a half.

=== Life in the United States ===


Encouraged by news of labor struggles and industrial disputes in the United States, Most emigrated to the US upon his release from prison in 1882. He promptly began agitating in his adopted land among other German émigrés. Among his associates was August Spies, one of the anarchists hanged for conspiracy in the Haymarket Square bombing, in whose desk police found an 1884 letter from Most promising a shipment of &quot;medicine,&quot; his code word for dynamite.

Most resumed the publication of the &quot;Freiheit&quot; in New York. He was imprisoned in 1886, again in 1887, and in 1902, the last time for two months for publishing after the assassination of President McKinley an editorial in which he argued that it was no crime to kill a ruler. He said: &quot;Whoever looks at America will see: the ship is powered by stupidity, corruption, or prejudice.&quot; Most initially advocated traditional collectivist anarchism, but later embraced anarchist communism. Most was famous for stating the concept of the &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; (&quot;Attentat&quot;): &quot;The existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.&quot;

Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885: &quot;The Science of Revolutionary Warfare,&quot; a how-to manual on the subject of bomb-making which earned the author the moniker &quot;Dynamost&quot;. A gifted orator, Most propagated these ideas throughout Marxist and anarchist circles in the United States and attracted many adherents, most notably Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Inspired by Most&#x27;s theories of Attentat, Goldman and Berkman, enraged by the deaths of workers during the Homestead strike, put words into action with Berkman&#x27;s attempted assassination of Homestead factory manager Henry Clay Frick in 1892. Berkman and Goldman were soon disillusioned as Most became one of Berkman&#x27;s most outspoken critics. In &quot;Freiheit&quot;, Most attacked both Goldman and Berkman, implying Berkman&#x27;s act was designed to arouse sympathy for Frick.

Goldman&#x27;s biographer Alice Wexler suggests that Most&#x27;s criticisms may have been inspired by jealousy of Berkman. Goldman was enraged, and demanded that Most prove his insinuations. When he refused to respond, she confronted him at next lecture. After he refused to speak to her, she lashed him across the face with a horsewhip, broke the whip over her knee, then threw the pieces at him. She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend, &quot;At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason.&quot; Most was in Cincinnati, Ohio, to give a speech when he fell ill. He was diagnosed with erysipelas. The doctors could do little for him, and he died a few days later.

== Personal life ==

His grandson was Boston Celtics radio play-by-play man Johnny Most.

<doc id="1292344" wikidata="Q6273342" url="?curid=1292344" title="Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere">
<text>Jonathan Harold Esmond Vere Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere (born 3 December 1967), is a British peer and owner of a newspaper and media empire founded by his great-grandfather Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere. He is the chairman and controlling shareholder of the Daily Mail and General Trust, formerly &quot;Associated Newspapers&quot;, a media conglomerate which includes the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Lord Rothermere was educated at Gordonstoun School and Duke University.

Harmsworth held various positions in Associated Newspapers and was managing director of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, when the sudden death of his father in 1998 resulted in his becoming the controlling shareholder and chairman of Associated and of its parent Daily Mail and General Trust just before his 31st birthday. One change he has instituted since becoming chairman is requiring directors to retire at age 75.

He has non-domicile (non-dom) tax status and owns his media businesses through a complex structure of offshore holdings and trusts.

According to the &quot;International Business Times&quot;:
In 2013, &quot;Private Eye&quot; reported that the non-dom status could be in doubt because of his stately home, Ferne House in Wiltshire, and status as a Freeman of the City of London.

He was a supporter of the then Conservative Party leader David Cameron.

He ranked fourth in the Publishing, Advertising, and PR section of the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; of 2013 with an estimated wealth of £720 million. In April 2015, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; estimated his net worth at £1 billion.

The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme at the end of January 2017 reported that David Cameron, when Prime Minister, had approached Lord Rothermere to sack Eurosceptic Paul Dacre, the editor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in the run up to the 2016 EU membership referendum. A representative of Lord Rothermere refused to confirm or deny the story, although a spokesman for Cameron confirmed that he had tried to persuade both Dacre and Rothermere over the vote. Rothermere&#x27;s representative told the media: &quot;Over the years, Lord Rothermere has been leant on by more than one prime minister to remove Associated Newspapers&#x27; editors but, as he told Lord Justice Leveson on oath, he does not interfere with the editorial policies of his papers&quot;.

Lord Rothermere chairs the Imperial War Museum foundation, following the tradition set by his great grandfather, the first Viscount.

==Personal life==
Rothermere married Claudia DeVriese, daughter of Terence J. Clemence, on 15 July 1993. They have five children:
*Vere Richard Jonathan Harold (born November 1994)
*Eleanor Patricia Margaret (born November 1996)
*Theodora Mairi Ferne (born July 2001)

<text>Torpedo juice is American slang for an alcoholic beverage, first mixed in World War II, made from pineapple, grapefruit or orange juice and the 180-proof (90% alcohol by volume) grain alcohol fuel used in United States Navy torpedo motors. Various poisonous additives were mixed into the fuel alcohol by Navy authorities to render the alcohol undrinkable, and various methods were employed by the U.S. sailors to separate the alcohol from the poison. Aside from the expected alcohol intoxication and subsequent hangover, the effects of drinking torpedo juice sometimes included mild or severe reactions to the poison.

In the first part of the Pacific War, U.S. torpedoes were powered by a miniature steam engine burning 180- or higher-proof ethyl alcohol as fuel. The ethyl alcohol was denatured by the addition of 5–10% &quot;pink lady&quot;, a blend of dye, methanol and possibly other ingredients. Methanol causes blindness when ingested, and cannot be made non-poisonous. 

Later, a small amount of Croton oil was added to the neutral grain spirits which powered U.S. torpedoes. Drinking alcohol with the oil additive caused painful cramps, internal bleeding and a violent emptying of the bowels. It was intended as a replacement for methanol which had caused blindness in some sailors. To avoid the Croton oil, sailors devised crude stills to slowly separate the alcohol from the poison, as alcohol evaporated at a lower temperature than Croton oil. The stills were sometimes called &#x27;Gilly&#x27; stills, and the resulting potable alcohol was known as &#x27;gilly&#x27; or gilly juice.

With the introduction of the electric powered U.S. Mark 18 torpedo, ethyl alcohol was no longer required for torpedoes; however, limited quantities of denatured alcohol were (and are) still required by the Electrician&#x27;s Mates and Interior Communications Electricians on board ship for the purpose of cleaning slip rings, commutators, and carbon brushes on a wide variety of equipment.

The standard recipe for torpedo juice is two parts ethyl alcohol and three parts pineapple juice.

<doc id="1292353" wikidata="Q452713" url="?curid=1292353" title="Sonique (media player)">
<text>Sonique is an audio player for Microsoft Windows. Released as freeware, Sonique is capable of handling MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Windows Media Audio (WMA), and audio CDs. Sonique was in development until 2002. It was one of the most popular desktop audio players, second only to Winamp. The major features of Sonique include support for irregular skins, the &quot;audioEnlightenment&quot; MP3 decoding engine by Tony Million, innovative audio visualizations, and a 20 band graphic equalizer.

== History ==
Sonique had roots in the lesser known Vibe MP3 player that Andrew McCann, Ian Lyman and Paul Peavyhouse created while studying at Montana State University. The trio called themselves Night55, a reference to the speed limit signs used in Montana. In 1997, Night55 sold the rights to Vibe to SGS Thompson for showcasing DVD features in COMDEX &#x27;98. After selling the rights to Vibe, Andrew McCann and Ian Lyman began work on Sonique, a more comprehensive MP3 player.

Sonique debuted in January 1998 at the first annual MP3 Summit to enormous excitement, receiving several acquisition offers the same day. Shortly after the MP3 Summit, Lyman and McCann returned to their hometown of Bozeman, Montana and formed Mediascience, Inc. They leased office space in a former coffee shop and hired additional staff to sustain their burgeoning user base. These early hires included Al-Riaz Adatia, Nicholas Vinen, Pol Llovet, and Tony Million. After talks with both Yahoo and Lycos, in 1999, Mediascience was sold to Lycos for . Terra Networks, S.A. acquired Lycos in mid-2001.

Shortly after the acquisition, the Sonique team began work on Sonique 2, intended to become a platform for listening to, organizing and purchasing digital music. This version, however, never reached general availability. Following the collapse of the dot-com bubble, Lycos laid off the entire Sonique team with the exception of McCann and Lyman. Unhappy with the summary termination of their colleagues, McCann and Lyman left shortly thereafter. A smaller team from Lycos corporate headquarters took over their job but never completed it.

== Design ==
Sonique features a highly stylized aesthetic with an animated menu, which could be customized via skins. Additional functionality includes a basic playlist editor, several visualization modes via plug-ins, a 20-band equalizer with spline-based level adjustment, and a control set featuring pitch, balance and amplification adjustment. It supported MP3, MP2, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, MOD, XM, IT, S3M, Audio CD and Windows Media Audio formats. Third-party plug-ins can add other audio formats and music visualization effect. Sonique can also play to audio streams.

Sonique comes bundled with a test Mp3 file featuring a song snippet by Mamasutra, entitled &quot;Sonique Theme.&quot; The comment field in the file metadata reads, &quot;Its so good, so good, so good,&quot; mirroring part of the lyrics.

<doc id="1292361" wikidata="Q110808631" url="?curid=1292361" title="Underground Resistance">
<text>Underground Resistance (commonly abbreviated to UR) are an American musical collective from Detroit, Michigan. Producing primarily Detroit techno since 1990 with a grungy four-track musical aesthetic, they are also renowned for their militant political and anti-corporate ethos.

==History==
First formed in 1989 by &quot;Mad&quot; Mike Banks and Jeff Mills, UR related the aesthetics of early Detroit techno to the social, political, and economic circumstances which followed on from Reagan-era inner-city economic recession, producing uncompromising music geared toward promoting awareness and facilitating political change. In contrast to techno that preceded UR, UR tried to appeal to lower class African Americans in Detroit. UR&#x27;s tracks created a sense of self-exploration, experimentation and the ability to change yourself and circumstances. Additionally, UR wanted to establish a means of identification beyond traditional lines of race and ethnicity. By targeting lower class African Americans, UR intended to inspire black men to get out of the poverty cycle in the city. Their mission was to return techno music to the underground: underground not meaning experimental and unpopular music, but rather a deliberate effort to create sonic communities on the periphery of mainstream culture as resistance against the socio-economic racial hierarchies. It was about providing new ways for lower class African Americans to form their identities. The Underground Resistance&#x27;s politics extended to providing alternative identities to inner city African American youth, other than the hyper-masculine, hard and violent identities existing within the city. This was a gendered group, however, and the UR focused their attention on young black men. Another form of UR&#x27;s rebellion concerns the rejection of the commercialization of techno. This is evident in the messages scratched in UR vinyl, lyrics and sounds expressing economic independence from major record labels.

Jeff Mills was already an established technical DJ who came from a background of &quot;industrial music&quot;, which was punchy, rigid, and influenced by European rock n roll with hubs in Belgium and Chicago. Mills was heavily influenced by the sound of groups like Belgium-based Front 242, and formed the group Final Cut in 1989 with Tony Srock for Paragon Records. After a falling out with producer Jerry Capaldi involving unequal power dynamics between the white suburban executives and the Black musicians, Final Cut left the label. Mills also left Final Cut in 1990, after which he joined Banks, whom he knew from early sessions at Paragon. Banks was also working on funk and house-inspired projects with the group &quot;Members of the House.&quot; At this time, Robert Hood was going by Robert Noise, and created artwork for the group&#x27;s 1987 LP. Banks had also previously been a part of a group called &quot;the Mechanics,&quot; which sometimes covered Kraftwerk&#x27;s songs live, again demonstrating the shift in the popularity of electric music from the house scene in Chicago to white artists and the European market. The goal of Underground Resistance would be to bring these sounds back to the communities that created them.

As Underground Resistance, Banks and Mills tried to get Juan Atkins of The Belleville Three and Cybotron to release their first record on his Metroplex label but he did not end up getting to the record quickly enough. The duo ended up releasing the record themselves, establishing their ethos for independent music releases, describing their sound as a &quot;rumor in the music.&quot; The group attempted to merge the sounds of both Final Cut and Members of the House on their first track The Theory, but really came into their sound by the fourth release, Waveform (1991). Their sound was informed by their lived realities as well as the music scene at the time, namely the &quot;Reagan era of inner-city economic recession&quot; that particularly affected Detroit, along with the longstanding racial relations of the country that led to the rise and collapse of the Black Panther Party. Their ethos consists of Afro-futurist and anti-corporate sentiments that center the self-fashioning of their own image and control of their production and distribution.

Their move against forces destroying their communities included a rejection of hedonism and the image of techno as drug music. They also have a persona that emphasizes anonymity to push back against the profiling of Black DJs, performing wearing balaclavas and touting the nondescript &quot;UR&quot; logo. This move was meant to work against the idea of the &quot;superstar DJ,&quot; emphasizing the mission of the music as a communal project. This anonymity is emphasized by the legion of artists that cycle through the collective, notably including Gerald Mitchell, DJ Rolando, and James Stinson of Drexciya.

In response to the economic reality of Black Detroiters at the time, Underground Resistance became involved with Submerge, a &quot;supportive economic community&quot; of labels and musicians but also lawyers and financial experts that allowed musicians to experiment with a financial safety net.

As with Public Enemy, there have been intimations that UR&#x27;s subversively &#x27;militant&#x27; approach to music was related to the activities of the Black Panthers in the 1970s. In a 2006 interview, Mills responds to that claim: &quot;All the black men you see in America today are the direct result of those actions: all the freedoms we have, as well as the restrictions, refer back to the government and the Black Panthers in the &#x27;70s&quot;. Mills continues: &quot;So we make music. We make music about who we are and where we’re from. Of course there are going to be links – that&#x27;s why we had songs with titles like &quot;Riot&quot;. Because that&#x27;s indicative of the era we were born in, and the things we remember. As time goes on, naturally I think the messages will get further away from that. It&#x27;s not a coincidence. There is a reason behind UR and Public Enemy and these people.&quot;

Many of UR&#x27;s earliest output would be the product of various experiments by Banks, Mills, and Hood – both solo and in collaboration. &quot;The Theory&quot; and &quot;Eye Of The Storm&quot; (Sonic EP) were among the two earliest UR tracks to be released in 1990, followed by a stream of EPs and singles including &quot;Riot&quot;, &quot;Acid Rain&quot;, and &quot;Jupiter Jazz&quot;. From Submerge came the Underground Resistance side projects X-101 and X-102. Under the aliases &quot;X-101&quot; and &quot;X-102&quot;, the trio released both EPs such as &quot;Sonic Destroyer&quot; and &quot;Groundzero (The Planet)&quot; and the albums &quot;X-101&quot; and &quot;X-102 Discovers The Rings of Saturn&quot;.

When Mills and Hood moved on from the collective in 1992 to achieve international success as solo artists and DJs, Banks continued to lead UR releasing EPs during the mid-1990s such as &quot;Return of Acid Rain&quot;, &quot;Message to the Majors&quot;, and excursions into Nu Jazz on &quot;Hi-Tech Jazz&quot; as Galaxy 2 Galaxy. Increasingly acclaimed artists such as DJ Rolando, Suburban Knight, and Drexciya also joined the collective.

&quot;Message to the Majors&quot;, released in 1992, saw UR in full opposition to the music industry and the commercialization of Techno. In the album notes, the collective writes, &quot;Message to all murderers on the Detroit Police Force -- We&#x27;ll see you in hell.&quot; What&#x27;s made clear by this oppositional rhetorics is that UR&#x27;s &quot;commitment to metropolitan politics and the criticism of its racist dimension seem to be at least equally important.&quot; In fact, URs discussion of race is an integral and distinguishing aspect of its politics and aesthetics that functions to directly oppose not only real-life systems of white supremacy, but also the media that maintains its prevalence in the mainstream.

&quot;Interstellar Fugitives&quot;, the first full album credited to Underground Resistance (and released in 1998), saw Mike Banks redefining the collective&#x27;s sound as &quot;High-Tech Funk&quot;, reflecting a shift in emphasis from hard, minimal club Techno to breakbeats, Electro and even occasionally Drum and Bass and down-tempo Hip-Hop.

In 2014, UR took part in a lecture and discussion at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art.

Their website proclaims the following call to action, encapsulating their attitudes towards the formal music economy:

&quot;Isn&#x27;t it obvious that music and dance are the keys to the universe? &quot;
&quot;So called primitive animals and tribal humans have known this for thousands of years! &quot;
&quot;We urge all brothers and sisters of the underground to create and transmit their tones and frequencies no matter how so called primitive their equipment may be. &quot;
&quot;Transmit these tones and wreak havoc on the programmers!&quot;
&quot;Long live the underground! &quot;

&quot;- Underground Resistance&quot;

== Conflict with Sony BMG ==
In 1999, DJ Rolando released UR&#x27;s most commercially successful EP, &quot;The Knights of The Jaguar&quot;. Legal and conceptual ownership of the track became the subject of a battle between UR and Sony BMG, the details of which are contested.

Sony claimed in subsequent statements that they first tried to contact UR to license the EP for release in Germany, recognizing the potential for a crossover hit. Receiving no response, they instead commissioned and released a trance cover version of the original, &quot;tone-for-tone&quot;, which was released as a promo. For their part, UR denies that they ever received a request from Sony to license the track.

Founding member &quot;Mad&quot; Mike denounced the release, arguing that it did not constitute a legitimate cover as it was intended to profit from rather than offer tribute to the group. When confronted, Sony justified its actions by stating they intended to credit Rolando as the composer of the work and grant him royalties on its sale.

Although the group initially suggested they might pursue legal action, they instead conducted a direct action campaign against the label. &quot;Mad&quot; Mike described the strategy as a conceptual rejection of the justice system and its legitimacy. Fans were encouraged to boycott the release and contact record stores and the labels themselves with messages of protest. Some fans reported vandalizing or destroying copies in record stores.

Due to the negative attention directed against the label, Sony voluntarily withdrew the release, citing a desire to avoid further damaging their relationship with the musical underground. The dispute ultimately contributed to the international popularity of the original UR release, which became seen as symbolic of the group&#x27;s independence and anti-corporate stance.

Rolando departed the collective in 2004.

== Underground Music Academy ==
Recently, the Underground Music Academy (UMA) was launched in May 2023 by the DJ and producer Waajeed, a student and collaborator of Underground Resistance. The UMA Bandcamp page defines it as “a Detroit-based community music hub, which aims to build the future leaders of electronic music through its distinctive educational curriculum and mentorship model, rooted in Detroit’s Black electronic music legacy.” The academy offers lessons on DJing and music production, offering scholarships to increase accessibility for marginalized youth.

Koffman is best known for her role as the fourth Cassie Callison on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Before landing the role of Cassie, Koffman played the short-term role of Lindsay on the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; in 1991.

On &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, she succeeded Ava Haddad, who portrayed Cassie from 1983–1986, with a brief reprise in 1990. Koffman portrayed the role from April 17, 1991 to January 1999, winning a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination in 1993 for Outstanding Younger Leading Actress. She left the show in 1999 when she was controversially fired while on maternity leave, something that was widely blamed on then-executive producer Jill Farren Phelps. She made several brief appearances on the series in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. She returned once again on February 15, 18 and 26 and March 1 of 2010, when Cassie&#x27;s family was being terrorized. After leaving &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1999 and giving birth to her son, Laura performed as Trish in &quot;Five Women Wearing the Same Dress&quot; by Alan Ball. Her daughter was born in 2001 at which time she took a break from acting to raise her children in Manhattan.

She portrayed the title role in an off-Broadway play by Myra Bairstow entitled &quot;The Rise of Dorothy Hale&quot; from June 2007 to January 2008. On October 28, 2008 Koffman returned to daytime television in the role of Rebecca Fowler on ABC&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot;.

She returned full-time to acting &amp; modeling, playing Angie in the independent film &quot;Concertoa&quot;, which was a Sundance 2009 Selection and Winner of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association Award. She also starred as Kitty in the staged reading of &quot;Otherwise&quot; by Vincent Crapelli, with Karen Ziemba and Beth Leavel.

In 2009, from June 17 to July 26, she portrayed the role of Elly in a production of &quot;Dance of the Seven Headed Mouse&quot; at the historic Beckett Theater in New York. John Simon of Bloomberg News, said of her; &quot;Outstanding is the Elly of Laura Bonarrigo, hitherto a model and TV actress; beautiful and talented, she deserves a rich theatrical career.&quot;

==Personal life==
She was married to Marty Koffman (in 1995); the couple have two children. They have been divorced for several years. She reverted to using her maiden name professionally.

In 2006, she started her own company, &quot;Feed Your Mouths&quot; helping other moms feed their children healthy nourishing meals &amp; snacks. Since then, she has worked closely with families &amp; individuals interested in changing the way they shop, cook and eat in their own homes.

She is a member of the historic acting club The Players.

<text>Vere Harold Esmond Harmsworth, 3rd Viscount Rothermere (27 April 1925 – 1 September 1998), known as Vere Harmsworth until 1978, was a British newspaper magnate. He controlled large media interests in the United Kingdom and United States.

==Early life==
Rothermere was born in 1925, third child and only son born to Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere, in his first marriage (dissolved by divorce in 1938), to Margaret Hunnam Redhead, daughter of William Lancelot Redhead. He was educated at Eton College in England and Kent School in Connecticut, United States. At the start of the Second World War his father had him evacuated to the United States. He later returned to Britain and served during the rest of the war in the British Army, mainly in North Africa, but was never commissioned as an officer.

After his marriage he lived much of the year in France, only partly for tax reasons.

==Business life==
Rothermere became the Chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1970, taking over from his father, who had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He was responsible for the relaunch of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as a tabloid, after which its circulation increased greatly under editor Sir David English. He may also be considered the founder of &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. After the death of his father in 1978, he also became chairman of parent company Daily Mail and General Trust plc (DMGT). He attempted to combine the companies in a manner calculated to avoid taxation. An artefact of this plan was the ownership of Associated Newspapers being vested in Associated Newspapers Holdings (ANH), ownership of which was split 50.2%-49.8% between DMGT and its wholly owned subsidiary Daily Mail &amp; General Holdings (DMGH). (Since that time DMGH&#x27;s name has been transferred to ANH, and the old DMGH has become Derry Street Properties)..

English succeeded him as chairman of Associated Newspapers (but not of ANH or of the parent companies) in 1992. When English died in mid-1998, Rothermere resumed the chairmanship of Associated Newspapers and replaced his protégé as president of the Commonwealth Press Union, only to die himself some months later, still chairman of DMGT, after being fatally stricken with a heart attack while dining with his son (and successor) Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere.

Harmsworth was a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute, which he helped establish alongside his sister Lady Cromer and Vyvyan Harmsworth.

Harmsworth&#x27;s newspapers supported the Thatcher government, but following Tony Blair&#x27;s landslide general election victory he defected to the Labour Party.

==Family life==
On 21 March 1957 Rothermere married actress Patricia Brooks. They had three children:

* Geraldine Theodora Gabriel Harmsworth (born 25 July 1957)
* Camilla Patricia Caroline Harmsworth (born 28 July 1964)
* Harold Jonathan Esmond Vere Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere (born 3 December 1967)

Following the death of his first wife on 12 August 1992, Rothermere married his longtime girlfriend, Maiko Jeong Shun Lee, in 1993.

<doc id="1292393" wikidata="Q806074" url="?curid=1292393" title="Mount Banahaw">
<text>Mount Banahaw (; also spelled as Banahao and Banájao) is an active complex volcano on Luzon in the Philippines. The three-peaked volcano is located at the boundary of Laguna and Quezon provinces. It is the highest mountain in both provinces and Calabarzon region, dominating the landscape for miles around.

The mountain is considered by many a holy mountain, thus a &quot;bundok dambana&quot;, and is popular among pilgrims along with mountain climbers. It is located in a protected area known as Mounts Banahaw–San Cristobal Protected Landscape covering of land.

== Physical characteristics ==
The andesitic Banahaw volcanic complex is composed of several stratovolcanoes with Mount Banahaw, the largest with a maximum elevation of above mean sea level. The summit is topped by a and deep crater that is breached on the southern rim believed to have been caused by the 1730 eruption. Prior to 1730, a lake occupied the summit crater of Mount Banahaw. The resulting flood destroyed the town of Sariaya, Quezon located below the mountain.

* Other peaks:
:*Mount San Cristobal (on the western slope)
:*Mount Banahaw de Lucban (at northeastern slope)
:*Buho Masalukot Domes (at southwestern slope)
:*Mount Mayabobo

* Maars: Lake Dagatan/Gunao Lake and Lake Ticob
* Thermal Areas:

:*Tiaong-San Pablo hot/warm springs
:*Bakia warm/cold springs
:*Sampaloc warm springs
:*Mainit hot/warm springs
:*Cagsiay hot/warm springs

== Importance to locals ==
Banahaw is a custom pilgrimage site for locals, believed by many as a holy mountain, a spiritually-charged location. The mountain and its environs are considered sacred by local residents; the water from its sacred springs are deemed &quot;holy water&quot; for allegedly having beneficial qualities, issuing forth from locations called &quot;puestos&quot; or &quot;holy sites&quot;. These sites are unique natural features composed not only of springs, but also caves, streams and boulders; with names with biblical allusions, and shrines erected in, on or around them. These locations were allegedly revealed to a man named Agripino Lontoc by the &quot;Santong Boses&quot; or the &quot;Holy Voices&quot;, which also gave the names to these places way back during the Spanish colonial era. Another one of these mountains is the adjacent Mount Banahaw de Lucbán.

Banahaw is also a part of the Makiling-Banahaw Watershed, a reservation of the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) providing steam for power generation, as well as water source for domestic and industrial uses.

==Hiking==

The mountain is popular not only with pilgrims but also among mountain climbers being the closest over mountain from Manila. Before 2004, hiking activity peaks during Holy Week each year, with climbers numbering to the thousands. At least four trails exist from Dolores, Sariaya, and other towns of Quezon located on its foothills. The most frequently used trails are the &quot;Cristalino&quot; and &quot;Tatlong Tangke&quot;, taking an average of 9 and 5 hours, respectively. These two trails originate from Barangay Kinabuhayan in Dolores, and meet near the summit, which is actually the rim of the Banahaw caldera. On the summit are viewpoints, labeled as &quot;Durungawan&quot; I, II, and III, which are the usual destination for pilgrims and hikers. Other points of interest include the &quot;Kuweba ng Diyos Ama&quot; (Tagalog: Cave of God the Father) and the spring at Brgy. Kinabuhayan, said to have curative powers.

=== Pollution ===
Due to incessant climbing activity the mountain trails have become littered with trash. In March 2004, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources ordered a 5-year suspension of hiking activity in the mountains, covering the Dolores and Sariaya trails. Reopening was delayed was then scheduled to March 2012, but was further extended to February 2015. Some sections of the mountain were reopened to hikers in 2019, and the mountain observed seasonal openings due to the mountain&#x27;s religious significance, but most sections of the mountain still remain closed.

== Biodiversity ==
Frogs endemic to Mount Banahaw include &quot;Platymantis banahao&quot;, &quot;Platymantis indeprensus&quot;, &quot;Platymantis montanus&quot;, &quot;Platymantis naomii&quot;, and &quot;Platymantis pseudodorsalis&quot;. 

===Reptilians===
The Banahao forest skink (Parvoscincus banahaoensis) is a species skink endemic to Mount Banahao, Philippines.

===Mammals===
Mount Banahaw-San Cristobal Protected Landscape is home to four endemic rodents: 

The Banahaw tree mouse (&quot;Musseromys gulantang&quot;) is a species of rodent endemic to Mount Banahaw in the Philippines.

<doc id="1292397" wikidata="Q587593" url="?curid=1292397" title="Lev Chernyi">
<text>Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov (; 1878–1921), commonly known by his pseudonym Lev Chernyi (), was a Russian individualist anarchist. Having joined the anarchist movement during the Russian Revolution of 1905, during which he developed his individualist theory of &quot;associational anarchism&quot;, Chernyi was arrested and exiled to Siberia for his revolutionary activities. After several escape attempts, one of which resulted in mutinous exiles capturing Turukhansk, he managed to flee to Paris, where he stayed until the Russian Revolution of 1917. After returning to Russia, he acted as secretary for the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups and organised the Black Guards, the federation&#x27;s armed wing. As political repression against anarchists intensified after the Bolsheviks took power, Chernyi joined an underground anarchist group, which bombed a Russian Communist Party meeting. In 1921, Chernyi and Fanya Baron were arrested on charges of counterfeiting and were executed by shooting by the Cheka. 

==Biography==
Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov was born to noble family in the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire, on . His father, Dmitrii Turchaninov, was a colonel in the Imperial Russian Army.

===Revolutionary activities===
After coming of age, Turchaninov enrolled in Moscow University but he was expelled in 1901 for his activity in revolutionary groups. By the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1905, he had joined the anarchist movement. 

Under the pseudonym Lev Chernyi, he wrote a manifesto of his newfound anarchist beliefs, &quot;Associational Anarchism&quot;, which he finished in February 1906. Chernyi&#x27;s brother Sergei Turchaninov, himself a Marxist and empirio-criticist, criticised his brother&#x27;s work for utopianism and a lack of basis in materialism. In its own &quot;Review of the Revolutionary Movement&quot;, the Ministry of Internal Affairs described Chernyi&#x27;s book as a &quot;paraphrasing&quot; of the work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Researcher Allan Antliff himself compared it to Max Stirner&#x27;s book &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot;.

From 1906 to 1908, Chernyi was a member of the &quot;Buntar&quot; group, through which he began a relationship with Nina Yagodina. In April 1908, he was exiled to the Yeniseysk Governorate in Siberia, while Yagodina was exiled Arkhangelsk Governorate in the Russian North. Turchaninov frequently attempted escaped from exile, aiming to reunite with Yagodina. 

===Exile===
In the autumn of 1908, he and a group of exiled revolutionaries made a plan to escape Siberia by hijacking a steamship. On 8 December 1908, the group ambushed a convoy at and headed north along the Yenisey, despite Chernyi&#x27;s objections to the choice of route. On , they captured Turukhansk, where they led an armed uprising against the Tsarist authorities. Although he had himself refused to participate in the revolt, he was arrested on ; two days later, the rebels were disarmed by the Imperial Russian Army. By this time, the authorities had identified Turchaninov as the writer Lev Chernyi. Despite his lack of direct involvement in the Turukhansk uprising, the Ministry of Internal Affairs held him responsible for organising the mutiny.

After this setback, he again made a last attempt to escape Siberia; this one was successful. Chernyi moved to Paris, where he lived until the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1917. Details about Chernyi&#x27;s Siberian exile were only revealed after the opening of the State Archive of the Russian Federation and the State Archive of Krasnoyarsk Krai, which contributed to a more complete biographical picture of his life.

===Return to Moscow===
After the February Revolution, Chernyi returned to Moscow, where he joined the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, serving as the organisation&#x27;s secretary. Although the Federation largely opposed illegalist and expropriative activities, Chernyi himself advocated for the organization to seize private homes. Following the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, Chernyi helped organise the Black Guards, the armed wing of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups. On 5 March 1918, the second issue of &quot;Anarkhiia&quot; after the October Revolution, Chernyi published an article in which he denounced the new Russian Soviet Republic and declared it to be as much of a threat as the old regime. In subsequent issues of the paper, Chernyi outlined proposals for the decentralisation of industry and the abolition of hierarchical power.

By the summer of 1918, political repression against the anarchist movement drove many of Moscow&#x27;s anarchists underground. In 1918, Chernyi himself facilitated the creation of an underground group of the Federation; and in 1919, he joined the Underground Anarchists, founded by Kazimir Kovalevich and Piotr Sobalev. On 25 September 1919, the Underground Anarchists carried out a bombing of a Russian Communist Party meeting, killing 12 functionaries and wounding 55 others, including Nikolai Bukharin, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky and Yuri Steklov. The bombing ultimately resulted in the intensification of political repression against the anarchists. Chernyi himself was not directly involved in the bombing. 

===Arrest and execution===
During the political repression that followed the bombing, Lev Chernyi and Fanya Baron were detained on charges of counterfeiting. In September 1921, Chernyi and Baron were shot by the Cheka. Their execution drew protests from others in the Russian anarchist movement, including Emma Goldman. The public outcry led to the government of Vladimir Lenin ordering the release and immediate deportation of a number of anarchist political prisoners, while other anarchists voluntarily left the country.

==Political ideology==
Chernyi&#x27;s &quot;associational anarchism&quot; was a spin on individualist anarchism, based on the free association of individuals. Together with Alexei Borovoi, Chernyi was a leading figure of individualist anarchism during the revolutionary period in Russia. They were both inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s call for the overthrow of bourgeois values, as well as Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s opposition to society. They even rejected the anarchist communism advocated by Peter Kropotkin, as they believed it would stifle individual freedoms.

<doc id="1292400" wikidata="Q336171" url="?curid=1292400" title="David Young, Baron Young of Graffham">
<text>David Ivor Young, Baron Young of Graffham, (27 February 1932 – 9 December 2022) was a British Conservative politician, cabinet minister, businessman, and life peer. He served as Secretary of State for Employment and for Trade and Industry, and later reported to government on health and safety, small business and government procurement.

==Early life==
David Young was born into an orthodox Jewish family in London. His father was born in Yurevich, near Minsk, a village that is now in Belarus but was then largely populated by Lithuanian Jews, including Young&#x27;s own family. The family fled an antisemitic pogrom to England when David&#x27;s father was 5.

In England, Young&#x27;s father imported flour and later set up as a manufacturer of coats for children. Young went to Christ&#x27;s College in Finchley and then University College London, to take a law degree as an evening student during his time as an articled clerk to become a solicitor, being admitted to the roll of solicitors in 1955.

==Business career==
Having qualified as a solicitor, Young practised for only a year, after which he joined Great Universal Stores as an executive, working for part of that time as an assistant to the chairman, Sir Isaac Wolfson.

In 1961 he left GUS and set up his first business, Eldonwall Ltd. with funding from the Gestetner Family Settlements. During the sixties he built up a group of companies in industrial property, construction and plant hire, selling out in June 1970 to Town &amp; City Properties PLC (T&amp;CP), where he joined the board.

After the property crash of 1973–1974, Young assisted Jeffrey Sterling to reverse his company into T&amp;CP to form a group that later became P&amp;O. 

In 1975, Young he left the board and entered into a joint venture with Manufacturers Hanover, and became chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Property Services, lending on real estate in the United Kingdom and overseas. He also had a number of other commercial interests. He sold out all his commercial interests in 1980 upon entering the Department of Industry. His younger brother, Stuart, served as chairman of the BBC.

==Margaret Thatcher==
Young became involved in voluntary organisations as chairman of the vocational training charity British ORT; he was made a director of the CPS in 1979 shortly after the general election that brought Margaret Thatcher to power. On the first day of the new government, Keith Joseph, the Secretary of State for Industry, appointed him his advisor responsible for what later became known as privatisation.

Because of his involvement with vocational training through ORT, he was picked by Norman Tebbit when he was Secretary of State for Employment to be the chairman of the Manpower Services Commission in 1981, the Government Agency dealing with unemployment and training matters. As such he became involved in government decisions and the Cabinet ministers who dealt with him regarded him very positively; he made his position as a &#x27;dry&#x27; on economic policy.

He was created a life peer taking the title Baron Young of Graffham, of Graffham in the County of West Sussex on 10 October 1984. One month later, on 11 September it was announced that Young was to enter the cabinet as Minister without Portfolio (the first person to hold the role since Lord Aberdare in 1974) to advise the government on unemployment issues. As Minister without Portfolio he was appointed to the Privy Council. On 2 September 1985 he became Secretary of State for Employment.

===1987 election===
Thatcher regarded Young as personally loyal to her and decided in March 1987 to put him into a central role in planning the 1987 election campaign, in effect to keep an eye on Norman Tebbit whom she suspected to be more interested in advancing his claims on the leadership. Young was in charge of organising Thatcher&#x27;s tours and appearances on television. One week before polling day on 4 June 1987, Young and Tebbit had a major disagreement about the campaign strategy, a day nicknamed &#x27;Wobbly Thursday&#x27;. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, Young grabbed Tebbit by the lapels and said &quot;Norman, listen to me, we are about to lose this fucking election&quot;.

===Trade and Industry===
Following the election Tebbit announced his retirement from the government, and Young was promoted to Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. He served two years in the role and privatised the last of the state industries in the department. In May 1989 he told the prime minister he would like to return to private life. He resigned from the Cabinet in 1989 but received an appointment as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party to help Kenneth Baker reorganise Central Office.

Young stood down from his ministerial post on the resignation of Thatcher.

==Later business career==
Young then went back to business as a director of Salomon Inc. and executive chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless. From 1993 he was president of the Institute of Directors, and from 1995 was chairman of Council of University College, London. He was the first president of Jewish Care (1990–1997).

Young retired from Cable &amp; Wireless in 1995 and in 1996 set up his own company, Young Associates Ltd, with partners Simon Alberga and Yoav Kurtzbard, which actively invests in technology companies. Outside Young Associates he had a number of business interests. He was chairman and controlling shareholder of the Camcon Federation of companies, a Cambridge-based federation of companies with innovative technology in the oil and gas, auto and medical fields. He was controlling shareholder and on the board of TSSI Systems Ltd, a long-established company in security technology, and in both these companies he worked with Danny Chapchal. He was a substantial shareholder and chairman of Deep Tek Ltd, a company with developed technology to enable operations in deep and ultra-deep waters in the oil and gas sectors and in scientific exploration. He was a substantial shareholder and chairman of KashFlow Software Ltd, a leading provider of online accounting for SMEs.

In 1996, Young was involved in the privatisation of the Rostock Port, in Germany. Following several years of decline in port traffic, the Rostock city council agreed to sell the port to Kent Investments Ltd., a company controlled by Young, in partnership with two Israeli businessmen, Menachem Atzmon and Ezra Harel. It was later discovered that Young was only a frontman for the Israeli investors. The two were later under investigation by Israel Securities Authority, suspected of fraud and breach of trust. They acquired the port by obtaining a loan from Rogosin Industries, a public company they controlled, which raised the money by issuing bonds. Rogosin Industries then received an option to buy 25 percent of the port in exchange for forgiving the loan. Rogosin Industries eventually exercised this option, which left Harel and Atzmon owning 75 percent of Rostock Port using Rogosin&#x27;s funds. The case was investigated after Rogosin Industries defaulted on its bonds, as it run out of cash to pay its bondholders. The company later went into liquidation.

==2010 Cameron–Clegg government==
In June 2010, Young was chosen by PM David Cameron to advise on health and safety laws:
To investigate and report back to the Prime Minister on the rise of the compensation culture over the last decade coupled with the current low standing that health and safety legislation now enjoys and to suggest solutions. Following the agreement of the report, to work with appropriate departments across government to bring the proposals into effect. (See report &#x27;Common Sense Common Safety&#x27; below.)

In July, he moved from the Cabinet Office to Number 10. In November 2010, Young was obliged to apologise for having told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that, &quot;For the vast majority of people in the country today, they have never had it so good ever since this recession – this so-called recession – started ...&quot; He resigned, but was subsequently reappointed.

In October 2010, he released a review of workplace health and safety in the UK entitled &#x27;Common Sense Common Safety&#x27;, which faced many of the issues and saying that businesses now operate their health and safety policies in a climate of fear because sensible health and safety rules that apply to hazardous occupations have been applied across all occupations, and the excessive &quot;enthusiasm with which often unqualified health and safety consultants have tried to eliminate all risk rather than apply the test in the Act of a &#x27;reasonably practicable&#x27; approach&quot;. Young said that part of the responsibility lay with the EU&#x27;s 1989 Framework Directive, which made risk assessments compulsory across all occupations, whether hazardous or not. Within days of the release of the review, the flood of health and safety stories in the press abated.

===Enterprise Advisor===
In October 2010, he was appointed enterprise adviser to Cameron, and was asked to conduct a &quot;brutal&quot; review of the relationship of government to small firms. This resulted in a three-part review to the prime minister on enterprise and small business.

*In May 2012, Young delivered the first part of this review. Entitled &quot;Make Business Your Business&quot;, it was the first of its kind since the Bolton Report of 1971. His report highlighted the number of start-up businesses to indicate a growing culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship in the UK. The report introduced a new Government programme, Start Up Loans, providing loans and mentoring to get a business venture started. Start Up Loans had as of June 2016 provided over £129 million of loans to 25,000 people.
*In June 2013, Young delivered a report entitled &quot;Growing Your Business&quot;, which looked at how new and developing small firms could grow and expand into new markets. Following this, the government introduced reforms within public procurement with the aim of making it easier for small suppliers to win public sector contracts; a new &quot;Small Business Charter&quot;, which aimed to extend the reach of university business schools into their local small business communities, and which he remained Patron of; and a &quot;Growth Voucher programme&quot; to assist companies &quot;find and pay for professional strategic advice&quot;.
*Young&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Report on Small Firms&quot; spoke of a &quot;Golden Age for Small Firms&quot;, measured through a record number of small businesses being in existence and the sector&#x27;s contribution to overall business employment in the UK.

In June 2014, Young reviewed the relevance of enterprise in education in his report &quot;Enterprise for All&quot;. In December 2014 the Government accepted Young&#x27;s recommendations in this report. These included the introduction of Enterprise Advisers, intended as a dedicated resource available to Head Teachers to support them in developing an appropriate careers and enterprise offer for their students, and an &#x27;Enterprise Passport&#x27; through which young people would record their enterprise and extracurricular activities alongside their academic qualifications to future employers.

Young was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2015 New Year Honours.

==Charity interests==
Young had a number of &quot;pro bono&quot; or charitable interests including the presidency of Chai Cancer Care and the Coram Trust, chairman of the Chichester Festival Theatre and of the Jewish Museum London, and trustee of the Co-Existence Trust and the MBI Al Jaber Foundation.

In December 2010, he became a patron of Lifelites, a charity providing technology for children in hospices.

==Publications==
Young&#x27;s political autobiography, &quot;The Enterprise Years&quot;, was published in 1990.

He wrote occasional opinion pieces. In one, he likened Boris Johnson to Harold Macmillan, while touting Enterprise Zones and suggesting the reintroduction of Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;more successful programmes like the Enterprise Allowance Scheme of old that created so many new businesses at the time.&quot;

==Personal life==
Young was married to Lita (née Shaw), and they had two daughters, Karen and Judith. He died on 9 December 2022, at the age of 90.

<text>Russell was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was located in the southwestern section of the province.

==Historical riding==
The original Russell riding was created in 1886, shortly after the expansion of Manitoba&#x27;s western boundaries. It existed until 1957, when it was combined with the riding of Birtle as Birtle-Russell. The riding was primarily agrarian, and elected candidates from various parties who supported agrarian interests.

==List of provincial representatives==
==Modern riding==
The riding of Birtle-Russell lasted from 1957 to 1979, and the subsequent riding of Roblin-Russell from 1979 to 1999. In 1999, the Roblin section of the riding was joined with Dauphin as Dauphin—Roblin, and a separate Russell riding was re-established. The riding was dissolved again in 2011.

The modern riding was bordered to the north by Dauphin—Roblin, to the east by Ste. Rose, to the south by Minnedosa and Arthur-Virden, and to the west by the province of Saskatchewan. The town of Russell was the main urban centre in this riding, which also included Birtle, Inglis, Angusville, Rossburn, Erickson, Oakburn, Shoal Lake and Hamiota. The Riding Mountain National Park and Asessippi Provincial Park were also located in Russell.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 18,647. In 1999, the average family income was $39,999, and the unemployment rate was 6.10%. Russell remained primarily an agrarian riding, with agriculture accounting for 32% of its industry. Fourteen per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents were aboriginal, and a further 13% were Ukrainian. The riding also had the second-highest percentage of senior citizens in Manitoba, at 21% of the total.

The last MLA was Len Derkach of the Progressive Conservative Party, who held the riding of Roblin-Russell from 1986 to 1999. The New Democratic Party made serious inroads in the riding before its dissolution.

Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, the riding was renamed Riding Mountain and expanded to include parts of the riding of Minnedosa. This change took effect for the 2011 election.

<text>Smokin&#x27; O.P.&#x27;s is the fifth studio album by American rock singer-songwriter Bob Seger, released in 1972 (see 1972 in music). It marked Seger&#x27;s return to rock and roll, after the sonic departure of his previous album, &quot;Brand New Morning&quot;. The album was reissued on CD by Capitol Records in 2005. It is currently the earliest Bob Seger album available on CD. The cover art is a parody of the Lucky Strike cigarette logo. &quot;Smokin&#x27; O.P.&#x27;s&quot; refers to Smokin&#x27; Other People&#x27;s Songs, a derivation on the slang phrase &quot;Smoking O.P.&#x27;s&quot; meaning to smoke other people&#x27;s cigarettes exclusively (never purchasing your own for consumption). Most of the tracks on this release are covers of songs written by other artists.

The album cover was created by Thomas Leroy Weschler, who was Seger&#x27;s road manager at the time. The cover was inspired by an advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes. Weschler also went on to co-write &quot;Traveling Man: On the Road &amp; Behind the Scenes with Bob Seger&quot;. The first pressings have a poem from Bob Seger, with an insert listing contributing musicians, but subsequent issues have the poem omitted and replaced by the insert information.

&quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot; and &quot;Hummin&#x27; Bird&quot; were recorded and mixed at RCA Studios, Toronto, Canada.

<doc id="1292420" wikidata="Q5398564" url="?curid=1292420" title="Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere">
<text>Esmond Cecil Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere (29 May 1898 – 12 July 1978), was a British Conservative politician and press magnate.

==Early life==
Harmsworth was the third son of Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, who had founded the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in partnership with his brother Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe. He was educated at Eton College and commissioned into the Royal Marine Artillery in World War I. His two older brothers were both killed in action. Esmond served as aide-de-camp to the prime minister at the Paris Peace Conference. In 1919, he was elected as a Unionist Member of Parliament for the Isle of Thanet, one of the youngest MPs ever. He served until 1929.

==Press career==
After 1922, the Daily Mail and General Trust company was created to control the newspapers that Lord Rothermere retained after Lord Northcliffe&#x27;s death (&quot;The Times&quot;, for example, was sold). As his father dabbled in association with the Nazis and a flirtation with becoming King of Hungary, it fell to Harmsworth to manage the businesses. His father retired as chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1932 at the age of 64, and Harmsworth took over that role. He served as chairman until 1971, after which he assumed the titles of president and director of group finance, and chairman of Daily Mail &amp; General Trust Ltd, the parent company, from 1938 until his death.

Harmsworth also had a significant impact on the development of Memorial University of Newfoundland (the family has had a long-standing interest in Newfoundland, having built a paper mill in Grand Falls before the outbreak of the First World War). The university&#x27;s first residence in Paton College, known as Rothermere House, is named after the Viscount. Harmsworth was the first Chancellor of Memorial University and the benefactor who provided the funds to construct Rothermere House.

==Personal life and death==
Lord Rothermere succeeded his father in the viscountcy in 1940. He married three times and had four children. His first marriage was to Margaret Hunnam Redhead (1897-1991), daughter of William Lancelot Redhead of Carville Hall, Brentford, on 12 January 1920 (divorced 1938). They had three children:

* Lorna Peggy Vyvyan Harmsworth (1920–2014), who married Neill Cooper-Key MP (1907–1981), and had issue, two sons and two daughters; her younger and only surviving son was the first husband of Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon (mother by later marriages of actress Isabella Calthorpe and society beauty Cressida Bonas).
* Esmé Mary Gabrielle Harmsworth (1922–2011), who married Rowland Baring, Viscount Errington (later 3rd Earl of Cromer), and had issue, two sons and one daughter, before his death in 1991. In 1993, she married secondly, to Captain Reinier Gerrit Anton van der Woude, whose first wife had been Lady Penelope Herbert (1925–1990), a daughter of the 6th Earl of Carnarvon.
* Vere Harmsworth, 3rd Viscount Rothermere (1925–1998)

He married, secondly, Ann Geraldine Mary O&#x27;Neill (née Charteris), widow of Shane O&#x27;Neill, 3rd Baron O&#x27;Neill, who had been killed in action in 1944 in Italy. She was the daughter of Captain Guy Lawrence Charteris (second son of the 11th Earl of Wemyss) and Frances Lucy Tennant. They married on 28 June 1945 and divorced in 1952. She then married writer Ian Fleming in 1952.

Lord Rothermere married, thirdly, Mary Murchison, daughter of Kenneth Murchison, on 28 March 1966, by whom he had a second son:

* Esmond Vyvyan Harmsworth (b. 1967), who moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1993.

Lord Rothermere died on 12 July 1978, aged 80, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Vere Harmsworth.

<text>Phoebe Child (12 May 1910–13 February 1990) was one of the pioneers of the Montessori Method of children&#x27;s education and a co-founder of the Montessori World Educational Institute.

== Biography ==
Born in England, she first studied the Montessori approach with Maria Montessori in London in 1929. She then joined fellow students, Margaret Homfray, and Edna Andriano, in Italy to serve as English translators for the 1930 course in Rome. She, along with Margaret Homfray, continued to work with Montessori and later traveled with her to Ireland to translate her lectures in teacher training.

=== St. Nicholas Training Centre ===
In 1946, Montessori worked with Child and Homfray to start an English Montessori teacher training program, which later became the St. Nicholas Training Centre for the Montessori Method of Education. The training program eventually offered full-time residence training in two former embassy sites in Princes Gate in London, as well as a correspondence course.

Phoebe Child and Margaret Homfray served as co-principals for the training college for many years and trained thousands of Montessori teachers from all over the world. They also helped set up the St. Nicholas training center in Ireland and then went on to establish the Montessori World Educational Institute in the United States and Australia.

<text>Titus is an American dark comedy sitcom that debuted on Fox in 2000. The series was created by its star, Christopher Titus, Jack Kenny, and Brian Hargrove. The sitcom is based on Titus&#x27;s stand-up comedy act, more specifically his one-man show &quot;Norman Rockwell is Bleeding&quot; (which itself would be broadcast on television in 2004), which was based loosely upon his real-life family; lines from &quot;Norman Rockwell is Bleeding&quot; were spoken by Titus as commentary. Titus plays an outwardly childish adult based on himself, who owns a custom car shop. The show follows him and his dimwitted half-brother Dave, his girlfriend Erin with the &quot;heart of gold&quot;, his goody-goody friend Tommy, and his arrogantly lewd, bigoted, heavy smoking and drinking, womanizing, divorced multiple times, father Ken &quot;Papa&quot; Titus.

==Overview==
Titus began doing comedy when he was 18. After two years of relatively normal comedy bits, his act soon began to evolve to focus around his family, particularly his father&#x27;s heart attacks and his mother&#x27;s mental illness.

One night while performing, an assistant to a Fox executive was in the audience, and he brought his bosses to the show.

==Production==
Knowing he had a deal with Fox, Titus wanted &quot;Dad is Dead&quot; to be the pilot. After the series ended, Titus commented that, if one watches &quot;Norman Rockwell is Bleeding&quot;, and then &quot;Dad is Dead&quot;, the latter essentially &quot;rapes&quot; the former.

Because Kenny and Hargrove came from live theater, and Titus from live comedy, it was a unanimous decision that the live story would be shot in real time, like a play, in as few takes as possible; as cues for the editors in post-production, so they could incorporate flashbacks and action in the neutral space, the action would pause briefly, and then resume. Episodes were blocked and rehearsed extensively, and shot on Friday every week.

The cast also had different methods of working. Being a comedian, Titus knew where the punchline would be and never explored anything else. Zack Ward had difficulty finding the joke during rehearsals, but Kenny realized that he was looking for where the joke &quot;could&quot; be. Watros asked Titus to point out where the joke was, and promised to hit her marks. During breaks in rehearsal, Shatraw would work by himself on set, looking for specific quirks or actions that Tommy would do or take.

The season two episode &quot;The Last Noelle&quot; is one of Titus&#x27;s favorites, and is based on his relationship with an abusive ex-girlfriend.

As a running gag, in most of the episodes there is a reference to guns and/or fire, usually the threat of someone or something being set on fire, as well as Titus&#x27;s story of how he drunkenly fell into a bonfire and nearly died when he was a teenager.

===Casting===
Cynthia Watros was the first person to audition for the role of Erin, and was also the first person cast. Steve Carell and Zack Ward both auditioned for Tommy; Carell lost out to David Shatraw, while Ward was soon cast as Titus&#x27;s brother, Dave. After a number of auditions for Titus&#x27;s father Ken, Stacy Keach was cast after Titus admitted Keach intimidated him.

Before his death, Christopher&#x27;s real father, Ken Titus, would give tips to Keach on how to better portray him. Titus also admitted that, even with the driest line the writers could invent, Keach would find a way to make the line funny. This often upset Titus because Keach&#x27;s set-up would be funnier than Titus&#x27;s punchline. Hargrove has also commented that Keach could get an audience response with just a look; Hargrove&#x27;s favorite moment is the look Ken gives Tommy in &quot;Insanity Genetic (1)&quot; after Tommy comments &quot;I have no nuts.&quot;

==Censorship by the network==
More than one episode was censored/banned by Fox, including a two-part episode made in the months after the September 11 attacks that centers on the premise that the U.S. government believes Titus and his family and friends are a terrorist group after a series of misunderstandings – as a result of his mother&#x27;s suicide, Titus suffers a nervous breakdown on the plane ride home, Tommy complains to a flight attendant about his mispronunciation of &#x27;chicken à la king&#x27;, to the point where Tommy gets down on his knees and cries &quot;A la, a la, a la king!&quot; (which sounds like &quot;Allah king&quot;), and Dave comes out of the plane&#x27;s bathroom gurgling mouthwash, which seems like he is speaking unintelligibly, and wearing a towel turban, a robe, and shaving cream on his face which resembles an Islamic beard.

The episode &quot;The Intervention&quot; was also almost banned, as the censors were wary about the episode glorifying alcoholism, since the story focused on Titus convincing his father, Ken, to start drinking again since Ken&#x27;s sobriety is making him boring. Titus had to read the script to the president of Fox page-by-page over the phone to show him how the episode could be funny.

Another episode, &quot;The Protector&quot;, was not aired until the very end of the last season, as it dealt with the revelation that Erin&#x27;s niece, Amy, was molested by a male family friend who looked after her while her parents were in prison, which Amy remembers because the man had a rose tattoo on his penis. Had &quot;The Protector&quot; aired in production order, viewers would have seen the real reason behind Amy&#x27;s asocial, criminal behavior (besides the fact that her parents are drug addicts who neglected her and were always in jail for drug crimes or domestic violence). Also, if &quot;The Protector&quot; had been broadcast in production order, the references to Amy being molested and going after a boy who sexually harassed her in school (who turns out to be the son of the man who molested Amy) in such episodes as &quot;The Session&quot; and &quot;Insanity Genetic (2)&quot; (which, in production code order, aired after &quot;The Protector&quot;) would have made more sense.

&quot;The Wedding&quot; was aired out of order, as well, as the season three premiere &quot;Racing in the Streets&quot; deals with Titus&#x27;s recovery from the accident in &quot;The Pit&quot; and continues in &quot;The Pendulum&quot;, yet he seems unaffected and the accident is not mentioned in the season two finale. This is also confirmed by these episodes&#x27; production codes, which puts &quot;The Wedding&quot; in between &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Girlfriend II&quot; and &quot;Hard Ass&quot;. &quot;The Wedding&quot; was banned due to scenes depicting violence at a church—Juanita&#x27;s second husband punches her in the face after the two argue about Juanita taking her medication, and Juanita ends up shooting him after Titus, Ken, Dave, and the priest presiding over the wedding tie up the man and yell at him for abusing her.

===Cancellation===
On a Sirius Radio interview on Raw Dog 104, Titus said the show got canceled due to an argument with executives. They wanted to split up Titus and Erin because the show &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; had done similar and their ratings went up. Titus refused, because not only was he still married to his then-real wife, Erin Carden, but the entire focus of the show as &quot;two screwed up people living a normal life&quot; would be compromised. Upon Titus&#x27;s refusal, on-air promotion ceased and the show was soon canceled. In another radio interview, he claimed the show was also taken down for its content and being &quot;too edgy&quot;.

===Cancelled revival===
As of May 2010, Christopher Titus was reportedly in negotiations with the Fox network to start up a new series again, billed as a sequel of sorts to his first sitcom (and based on his comedy specials &quot;The 5th Annual End of the World Tour&quot; and &quot;Love Is Evol&quot;). The series was confirmed to eventually be revived and pick up eight years later with Titus divorced from Erin, Titus&#x27;s father dead, and Titus dealing with his new normal girlfriend and her perfect family.

In March 2014, Titus posted on his Facebook page that the revival project was shut down due to legal issues with 20th Century Fox and limited funding.

==Format==
Part of the show&#x27;s success was its unique format; a few exceptions aside, the show stuck to what worked. The &quot;neutral space&quot; was where Titus opened and ended the show. This lead-in and lead-out allowed for one liners and a monologue, before heading to what the producers called the Main Narrative, or &quot;Live Story&quot;. The live story was the bulk of the action, and was the basis for the theme of the episode and the other gags. The live story was unique in that it was extensively rehearsed throughout a production week, and shot in one day, in as few takes as possible. The result allowed the actors to keep their comedic timing, and kept the studio audience engaged to the point that the show did not have to employ a laugh track. Also of note was that the Live Story was (for an overwhelming majority of shows) shot on just one set.

Most episodes also took place over a short course of time, usually only a few hours; very rarely would a plot carry over to &quot;the next day&quot;. The main narrative was frequently intercut with the neutral space, sometimes just a quick one-liner from Titus, or for either informative exposition, a quick flashback, or a sparingly used fantasy scene. The Live Story would also usually take place in one place, either a recurring location like Ken&#x27;s house, the garage of Titus&#x27;s car shop, or a one-time location like a bus station or a houseboat.

===Neutral space===

The show always opened and closed in the black and white neutral space, usually with the same sentence, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. Titus was the neutral space&#x27;s only occupant except in two episodes, when he was replaced by Ken and Erin, respectively, and would appear always wearing similar clothes, with a wooden chair, a lightbulb, and the bland walls. Frequently, props appeared for one-shot gags in the neutral space. Very rarely would anything from the Live Story appear there (one notable exception was Dave&#x27;s suicide note in &quot;Private Dave&quot;), nor would anything from the neutral space appear in the Live Story. There are many allusions to the neutral space being Titus&#x27;s mind, though it is never said outright. On a few occasions, the neutral space is used to demonstrate the passing of time, or Christopher will do something &quot;in&quot; the neutral space when he is really just thinking about it while doing it; we only see his thought process. Also, as in &quot;The Trial&quot;, sometimes he will say something in the neutral space and not realize he is also saying it in reality, like when he calls the prosecutor an idiot, thinking he only thought it. Following the credits in the final episode of the series (&quot;The Protector&quot;, not &quot;Insanity Genetic&quot; or &quot;Homecoming&quot;), Titus drags the bare wooden chair into the middle of a real life street, sets it on fire, and walks away, whistling part of the theme song.

===Flashbacks===
Flashbacks – always introduced from the Neutral Space – were frequently used for character development and background. Flashbacks generally went back to one of three time periods: when Titus was five, ten, or seventeen. Three different child actors played the five- and ten-year-old versions of Titus, the latter sometimes joined by five-year-old and ten-year-old versions of Dave and Tommy. Flashbacks to high school with the seventeen year old Titus had all of the current actors playing the younger versions of themselves. To compensate for being too old to believably play the roles, the actors have humorously exaggerated costumes and mannerisms. Except for a few flashbacks in &quot;Grandma Titus&quot; that featured Ken as a child, Stacy Keach is the only one to appear in all of his character&#x27;s flashbacks; only his hair and clothes change with the times. The flashbacks themselves had no specific format other than being quick, one laugh gags. They frequently showcased Ken Titus&#x27;s unique approach to parenting, relationships, and drinking. The women that Ken is shown dating (or even married to) in these flashbacks are frequently not given a name, and their faces are rarely shown. Episodes with guest characters who had any connection with the main characters, like Tommy or Erin&#x27;s families, frequently appeared in flashbacks as well.

Occasionally, instead of a flashback, a far-fetched &quot;What if...?&quot; scenario (showing an alternate reality, what Titus&#x27;s life will be like when he is older, or a one-off gag similar to those found on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;) will be presented, such as Titus and Erin as a bickering married couple in their old age, Titus and his father as rich men who use their butlers to beat each other up while Christopher and Ken read the newspaper, Titus trying to deal with Ken being married to a man, and Titus, Dave, and Ken as heads on a couch.

==Characters==

:&quot;Dave Titus&quot; appears on the DVD material, but Dave&#x27;s last name was given as Scoville in the show. The only clue to this discrepancy in the show proper is when Dave says he was never legally adopted by his father in the first season episode &quot;Red Asphalt&quot;.

==Episodes==

==Season ratings==
==Home releases==
Anchor Bay Entertainment (under license from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 in two packages in 2005/2006. Both are now out of print. In 2020, Christopher Titus himself began sharing full episodes of the show on his YouTube channel, eventually uploading all of the episodes. A few of them also have introductions where Titus briefly describes the premise of the episode itself.

==Reunion episode==
On August 21, 2020, Titus aired &quot;The Titus Family Reunion&quot; show on YouTube through Eventbrite which brought back the primary actors and added Titus&#x27;s real-life wife Rachel Bradley as Rachel. The reunion episode (titled &quot;Titus Family&quot; for legal reasons) was set eight years after the finale with Titus getting released from the mental institution and coming home to find that Erin is leaving him for Tommy and ending with Titus going to Mexico to get Papa Titus out of a Mexican jail. The special was written, directed and produced by Titus under his brand Combustion Films and was shot in a few days during the COVID-19 pandemic. The two-part episode is available as a downloadable purchase on Christopher Titus&#x27;s Combustion Films website.

<text>Luigi Galleani (; 12 August 1861 – 4 November 1931) was an Italian insurrectionary anarchist best known for his advocacy of &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot;, a strategy of political assassinations and violent attacks.

Born in Vercelli, he became a leading figure in the Piedmont labor movement, for which he was sentenced to exile on the island of Pantelleria. In 1901, he fled to the United States and he joined the Italian immigrant workers movement in Paterson, New Jersey. He subsequently moved to Vermont and Massachusetts, where he launched the radical newspaper &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot;. He gained many dedicated followers among Italian American anarchists, known as the &quot;Galleanisti&quot;, who carried out a series of bombing attacks throughout the United States.

For his involvement in the anti-war movement during World War I, he was deported back to Italy, where he was subjected to political repression following the rise of fascism. During the final years of his life, he published &quot;The End of Anarchism?&quot;, a defense of anarchist communism from criticisms by reformist socialists. He rejected reformism, in favor of &quot;continuous attack&quot; against institutions of capitalism and the state, and opposed any form of formal organization, which he saw as inherently corrupting and hierarchical.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Luigi Galleani was born on 12 August 1861, into a middle-class family, in the Piedmontese city of Vercelli. He first became interested in anarchism while studying law at the University of Turin, eventually renouncing his career in law in order to carry out anarchist propaganda against capitalism and the state. His skill in oratory and writing quickly made him a leading voice in the new generation of the Italian anarchist movement. Alongside Sicilian anarchist Pietro Gori, he led a resurgence of militant anarchist activism, which gained a large following among the workers of Northern Italy.

===Labor movement activism===
By the mid-1880s, the anarchists had already lost ground to the Italian Workers&#x27; Party (POI), which developed a large support base among northern workers. The anarchists were initially skeptical of the POI, due to the latter&#x27;s tendencies towards workerism and reformism, but relations between the two parties became more cordial over time. In 1887, Galleani led the Piedmontese anarchist movement&#x27;s reorientation towards the labor movement and its rapprochement with the POI. That year, he established the Turin-based newspaper &quot;Gazzetta Operaia&quot;, formed a number of workers&#x27; organizations in Vercelli, and distributed revolutionary propaganda among the factory workers of Biella. In 1888, he went on a lecture tour in towns throughout Piedmont and led a series of strike actions by Piedmontese workers in both Turin and Vercelli, increasing support for the anarchist movement and the POI.

Relations between the anarchists and the POI worsened, due to the latter&#x27;s continued participation in local elections. Nevertheless, Galleani continued to pursue the anarchist infiltration of the POI, in order to attempt to bring it towards revolutionary socialism. He continued to advocate for a conciliatory approach between the reformists and revolutionaries, resulting in the POI both continuing its electoral participation while also endorsing class conflict. Although he prevented a formal split from occurring, the two factions were ultimately irreconciable and Galleani&#x27;s attempts to transform the POI proved unsuccessful.

When he was threatened with arrest for his radical activism, in 1889 he fled to France and then to Switzerland. There he collaborated with the French anarchist geographer Élisée Reclus in the preparation of his &quot;Nouvelle Geographie Universalle&quot; and organised a students&#x27; demonstration at the University of Geneva, in honor of the Haymarket martyrs. Galleani was also scheduled to attend the Italian anarchist movement&#x27;s Capolago congress, but en route to the congress from Geneva, he was arrested by the Swiss authorities and expelled back to Italy. Back in Italy, he immediately continued his radical activities, embarking on a speaking tour of Tuscany, with the aim of fomenting an uprising on International Workers&#x27; Day of 1891.
In 1892, together with Pietro Gori and Calabrese anarchist Giovanni Domanico, Galleani was delegated to represent the anarchists at the Genoa Workers&#x27; Congress, with the intention of obstructing the motions of the dominant reformist faction. In opposition to the social democrats, led by Lombard lawyer Filippo Turati, an alliance was formed by the anarchists and the workerists, who both opposed political participation. On 14 August, a fierce argument broke out between the anarchist and socialist delegates, leading to two separate meetings being convened the following day. Having finally forced the anarchists to split from the movement, Turati&#x27;s social democratic majority established the new Italian Socialist Party (PSI), despite the objections of Galleani and his fellow delegates, whose own attempts at forming an anarchist party were unsuccessful. The congress proved that Galleani&#x27;s agitational campaign had ultimately failed to gain a mass following among the workers, leading to many Italian anarchists becoming disillusioned with the labor movement, which came under the direction of the PSI.

===Exile===
In the wake of the &quot;Fatti di Maggio&quot; (Bava Beccaris massacre), the Italian government launched a new campaign of political repression against the anarchist movement, arresting anarchists en masse and internally exiling them to small islands for up to five years, all without a trial. Galleani himself was swiftly arrested, convicted for conspiracy, and exiled to the Sicilian island of Pantelleria. There he met and married Maria Rallo, who already had a young son. Luigi and Maria Galleani had four children of their own.

With Elisee Reclus&#x27;s aid, Galleani managed escape from Italy to Egypt, where he stayed with other Italian immigrants for a year. When he was threatened with extradition back to Italy, he fled to the United States, arriving in October 1901, shortly after the assassination of United States President William McKinley.

===Life in the United States===
Galleani settled in Paterson, New Jersey, a hub for Piedmontese immigrant silk weavers and dyers, where he took up editing the Italian anarchist newspaper &quot;La Questione Sociale&quot;. He became a vocal supporter of the 1902 Paterson silk strike, giving a series of speeches in which he called for a revolutionary general strike to overthrow capitalism. When the striking workers clashed with police, he was shot in the face and charged for incitement to riot. He escaped to Canada and recovered from his wounds, before covertly returning over the border and hiding out in Barre, Vermont, where he stayed with Tuscan stonemasons from Carrara. With these new comrades, on 6 June 1903, he launched &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot;, which rapidly became the most influential Italian anarchist periodical in North America, receiving worldwide distribution. Through this new publication, in 1905 he published the bomb-making manual &quot;La Salute è in voi!&quot;, in which he supplied to his readers the formula for making nitroglycerine, compiled by a friend and explosives expert, Professor Ettore Molinari.

In 1906, the editor of the rival Italian socialist newspaper &quot;Il Proletario&quot; publicised Galleani&#x27;s location and he was quickly located by the authorities. Arrested, he was brought back to Paterson and tried for incitement, although a hung jury resulted in him being released. He returned to Barre, where he once again resumed giving fiery speeches and writing hundreds of articles for his newspaper, quickly becoming a leading voice in the Italian American anarchist movement. In late 1907, in response to Neapolitan socialist Francesco Saverio Merlino&#x27;s public renunciation of anarchism in favour of reformist labor unionism, Galleani published a series of articles in defense of anarchism. By this time, he had become disillusioned with the labor movement and came to reject labor unions entirely, instead adopting an anti-organizational form of anarchism, which became the dominant tendency within the Italian American anarchist movement. He even openly broke with the anarcho-syndicalist Carlo Tresca over the latter&#x27;s cooperation with the Industrial Workers of the World, causing a rift between their followers that undermined the Italian American anarchist movement&#x27;s cohesion.

Galleani gained many militant and highly devoted followers, known as the &quot;Galleanisti&quot;, who likewise rejected all formal organization and developed markedly extremist tendencies. These disciples included Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who promoted Galleani&#x27;s lectures and distributed his literature. The &quot;Galleanisti&quot;, following Galleani&#x27;s anti-organizational principles, formed small, tight-knit cells made up of &quot;self-selecting individuals&quot;. Although they rejected formal leadership, Galleani himself was treated with reverence and he had the status of an unofficial leader.

===Deportation and death===
Following the American entry into World War I, Galleani became a leading voice in the anti-war movement, declaring that the anarchist movement was &quot;Against the War, Against the Peace, For Social Revolution!&quot; In response to the Selective Service Act of 1917 being passed into law, he urged his followers to refuse registration and go into hiding, with he and many of his comrades moving to a cabin in the woods near Taunton, Massachusetts. At his direction, some Galleanisti escaped to Mexico, from which they planned to return to Italy, where they believed a revolution was imminent. Despite the ongoing Mexican Revolution, Galleani had rejected the possibility of an anarchist revolution in Mexico itself, due to its high population of people of color, whom he characterized as &quot;uninterested&quot; racial groups.

His anti-war activities made him a target for political repression by the American government. On 17 June 1917, federal agents raided the offices of the &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot; in Lynn, Massachusetts, arresting Galleani and shutting down the newspaper. Charged with conspiracy, he and eight of his followers were subsequently deported back to Italy, leaving his family behind in the United States, on 24 June 1919.

He attempted to continue publishing &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot; upon arrival in Turin, but it was quickly suppressed by the Italian authorities. In the wake of the March on Rome in 1922, he was arrested and convicted of sedition by the new fascist authorities, which sentenced him to 14 months in prison. After being released, he concluded his polemic against Merlino, writing a further series of articles and publishing them together in his book &quot;The End of Anarchism?&quot; (1925). While the book was hailed by Neapolitan anarchist Errico Malatesta as a key text in anarchist communism, in November 1926, it provoked his arrest by the fascist authorities, on charges of insulting the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Galleani spent time in the cell he had been kept in for months in 1892, before being banished to Lipari and later Messina, where he was imprisoned for 6 months.

In February 1930, he was granted compassionate release due to his failing health. He retired to , a &#x27;frazione&#x27; of Aulla, where he was kept under close and constant surveillance. After returning from a walk through the countryside, during which he was followed by the police, he collapsed from a heart attack, dying on 4 November 1931.

==Political ideology==

Galleani&#x27;s conception of anarchist communism combined the insurrectionary anarchism expounded by German individualist Max Stirner with the mutual aid advocated by Russian communist Peter Kropotkin. He defended the principles of revolutionary spontaneity, autonomy, diversity, self-determination and direct action, and advocated for the violent overthrow of the state and capitalism through propaganda of the deed.

He rejected all forms of formal organization, including anarchist federations and labor unions, and opposed participating in the labor movement, as he believed it was inherently reformist and susceptible to corruption. From his rejection of reformism, he concluded that social change could only be brought about through violent attacks against institutions, which he believed could build towards a popular insurrection. As such, he publicly endorsed terrorism, or what he called &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot;, which came in the form of the assassination of authority figures and the expropriation of private property. Galleani defended both the assassination of William McKinley by Leon Czolgosz and the assassination of Umberto I of Italy by Gaetano Bresci.

In his own words, his ultimate aim was to establish &quot;a society without masters, without government, without law, without any coercive control—a society functioning on the basis of mutual agreement and allowing each member the freedom to enjoy absolute autonomy.&quot; But he also rejected prefigurative politics, such as that advocated by anarcho-syndicalists, as he believed that people themselves would instinctively understand how to live as a free and equal society once the state and capitalism were overthrown.

==Legacy==
In retaliation for Galleani&#x27;s deportation from the United States, the &quot;Galleanisti&quot; launched a campaign of terrorist attacks, carrying out a series of bombings in 1919. In April 1919, the &quot;Galleanisti&quot; sent around thirty bombs out to government officials. Most of the bombs were intercepted and disarmed before reaching their destination, with only one detonating - injuring the intended target&#x27;s maid. In June 1919, they carried out a coordinated attack of nine bombings throughout the North-eastern United States, but none of their targets were killed or gravely wounded. One of the bombs detonated prematurely outside Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer&#x27;s house, killing the attacker. Another bomb that was placed in a church detonated following its discovery by police, killing ten police officers and a bystander. In the political repression that followed, many of the &quot;Galleanisti&quot; were arrested, including Italian American anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were executed despite the lack of evidence against them. In reprisal, the Galleanist Mario Buda was alleged to have carried out the Wall Street bombing of 1920, which killed 33 people.

During the 1930s, the Romanian American anarchist Marcus Graham attempted to revive the Galleanist movement with the San Francisco-based newspaper &quot;Man!&quot;, but its efforts were unsuccessful and the paper was shut down in 1939. By the time of the defeat of Italian Fascism in World War II, the Italian American anarchist movement had largely dissipated. The Galleanist &quot;L&#x27;Adunata dei Refrattari&quot; continued publication until 1971, when it was succeeded by the anti-authoritarian periodical &quot;Fifth Estate&quot;.

By the late-20th century, Galleani&#x27;s figure fell into obscurity, receiving relatively little research from scholars. It was only in 1982, when &quot;The End of Anarchism?&quot; received a translation into English, that interest in him again began to grow. In 2006, more English translations of his work were published in a compilation by AK Press.

<text>Cross Lake is on the border of Cayuga and Onondaga counties in the state of New York in the United States. The lake lies within the boundaries of the traditional Onondaga Indian Nation, and is reputed in local tradition to be the boyhood home of Hiawatha, the great peace maker. However, Onondaga Lake is also said to be Hiawatha&#x27;s home.

Cross Lake has a maximum depth of 65 feet and has an average depth of 18 feet. The Seneca River flows west to east through the south end of the lake. Since Cross Lake is part of the New York State Canal System, there are a variety of fish that pass through it. Cross Lake has a flushing rate of 51 times per year; once per week.

<text>David Rolfe Graeber (; February 12, 1961 
– September 2, 2020) was an American anthropologist and anarchist activist. His influential work in economic anthropology, particularly his books &quot;&quot; (2011), &quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Dawn of Everything&quot; (2021), and his leading role in the Occupy movement, earned him recognition as one of the foremost anthropologists and left-wing thinkers of his time.
Born in New York to a working-class family, Graeber studied at Purchase College and the University of Chicago, where he conducted ethnographic research in Madagascar under Marshall Sahlins and obtained his doctorate in 1996. He was an assistant professor at Yale University from 1998 to 2005, when the university controversially decided not to renew his contract before he was eligible for tenure. Unable to secure another position in the United States, he entered an &quot;academic exile&quot; in England, where he was a lecturer and reader at Goldsmiths&#x27; College from 2008 to 2013, and a professor at the London School of Economics from 2013.
In his early scholarship, Graeber specialized in theories of value (&quot;Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value&quot;, 2002), social hierarchy and political power (&quot;Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology&quot;, 2004, &quot;Possibilities&quot;, 2007, &quot;On Kings&quot;, 2017), and the ethnography of Madagascar (&quot;Lost People&quot;, 2007). In the 2010s he turned to historical anthropology, producing his best-known book, &quot;Debt: The First 5000 Years&quot; (2011), an exploration of the historical relationship between debt and social institutions, as well as a series of essays on the origins of social inequality in prehistory. In parallel, he developed critiques of bureaucracy and managerialism in contemporary capitalism, published in &quot;The Utopia of Rules&quot; (2015) and &quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot; (2018). He coined the concept of bullshit jobs in a 2013 essay that explored the proliferation of &quot;paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence&quot;.
Although exposed to radical left politics from a young age, Graeber&#x27;s direct involvement in activism began with the global justice movement of the 1990s. He attended protests against the 3rd Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in 2001 and the World Economic Forum in New York in 2002, and later wrote an ethnography of the movement, &quot;Direct Action&quot; (2009). In 2011, he became well known as one of the leading figures of Occupy Wall Street and is credited with coining the slogan &quot;We are the 99%&quot;. His later activism included interventions in support of the Rojava revolution in Syria, the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn and Extinction Rebellion.
David Graeber died unexpectedly in September 2020, while on vacation in Venice. His last book, &quot;The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity&quot;, co-written with archaeologist David Wengrow, was published posthumously in 2021.

Graeber&#x27;s parents, who were in their forties when Graeber was born, were intellectuals in New York. Graeber&#x27;s mother, Ruth Rubinstein, was Jewish and born and raised in Poland. She had been a garment worker, and played the lead role in the 1930s musical comedy revue &quot;Pins and Needles&quot;, staged by the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union. Graeber&#x27;s father, Kenneth, was from Lawrence, Kansas and was of German extraction. He was affiliated with the Young Communist League in college, participated in the Spanish Revolution in Barcelona and fought in the Spanish Civil War. He later worked as a plate stripper on offset presses. Graeber grew up in Penn South, a union-sponsored housing cooperative in Chelsea, Manhattan, described by &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine as &quot;suffused with radical politics.&quot;

Graeber had his first experience of political activism at the age of seven, when he attended peace marches in New York&#x27;s Central Park and Fire Island. He was an anarchist from the age of 16, according to an interview he gave to &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 2005.

Graeber graduated from Phillips Academy Andover in 1978 and received his B.A. from the State University of New York at Purchase in 1984. He received his master&#x27;s degree and doctorate at the University of Chicago, where he won a Fulbright fellowship to conduct 20 months of ethnographic field research in Betafo, Madagascar, beginning in 1989. His resulting Ph.D. thesis on magic, slavery, and politics was supervised by Marshall Sahlins and entitled &quot;The Disastrous Ordeal of 1987: Memory and Violence in Rural Madagascar&quot;.

== Academic career ==

=== Yale University (1998–2005) ===
In 1998, two years after completing his PhD, Graeber became assistant professor at Yale University, then associate professor. In May 2005, the Yale anthropology department decided not to renew Graeber&#x27;s contract, preventing consideration for academic tenure, which was scheduled for 2008. Pointing to Graeber&#x27;s anthropological scholarship, his supporters (including fellow anthropologists, former students and activists) said the decision was politically motivated. More than 4,500 people signed petitions supporting him, and anthropologists such as Marshall Sahlins, Laura Nader, Michael Taussig, and Maurice Bloch called on Yale to reverse its decision. Bloch, who had been a professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, and a writer on Madagascar, praised Graeber in a letter to the university.

The Yale administration argued that Graeber&#x27;s dismissal was in keeping with Yale&#x27;s policy of granting tenure to few junior faculty. Graeber suggested that Yale&#x27;s decision might have been influenced by his support of a student of his who was targeted for expulsion because of her membership in GESO, Yale&#x27;s graduate student union.

In December 2005, Graeber agreed to leave Yale after a one-year paid sabbatical. That spring he taught two final classes: &quot;Introduction to Cultural Anthropology&quot; (attended by more than 200 students) and a seminar, &quot;Direct Action and Radical Social Theory&quot;.

=== &quot;Academic exile&quot; and London (2005–2020) ===
On May 25, 2006, Graeber was invited to give the Malinowski Memorial Lecture at the London School of Economics. Each year, the LSE anthropology department asks an anthropologist at a relatively early stage of their career to give the Malinowski Lecture, and only invites those considered to have made significant contributions to anthropological theory. Graeber&#x27;s address was called &quot;Beyond Power/Knowledge: an exploration of the relation of power, ignorance and stupidity&quot;. It was later edited into an essay, &quot;Dead zones of the imagination: On violence, bureaucracy and interpretive labor&quot;. The same year, Graeber was asked to present the keynote address in the 100th anniversary Diamond Jubilee meetings of the Association of Social Anthropologists. In April 2011, he presented the anthropology department&#x27;s annual Distinguished Lecture at Berkeley, and in May 2012 he delivered the second annual Marilyn Strathern Lecture at Cambridge (the first was delivered by Strathern).

After his dismissal from Yale, Graeber was unable to secure another position at an American university. He applied for more than twenty, but despite a strong track record and letters of recommendation from several prominent anthropologists, never made it past the first round. At the same time, a number of foreign universities approached him with offers. In an article on his &quot;academic exile&quot; from the United States, &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; interviewed several anthropology professors who agreed that Graeber&#x27;s political activism could have played a role in his unsuccessful search, describing the field as &quot;radical in the abstract&quot; (in the words of Laura Nader) but intolerant of direct political action. Another factor suggested by the article was that Graeber had acquired a reputation as being personally difficult or &quot;uncollegial&quot;, especially in light of allegations of poor conduct made by Yale during the dispute over his dismissal. Graeber himself interpreted his exclusion from American academia as a direct result of his dismissal from Yale, likening it to &quot;black-balling in a social club&quot;, and arguing that the charge of &quot;uncollegiality&quot; glossed a variety of other personal qualities, from his political activism to his working-class background, that marked him as a trouble-maker within the academic hierarchy. Laura Nader, reflecting on Graeber&#x27;s case amongst other examples of &quot;academic silencing&quot; in anthropology, speculated that the real reasons could have included Graeber&#x27;s growing reputation as a public intellectual, and his tendency to &quot;write in English&quot; rather than jargon.

From 2008 to 2013, Graeber was a lecturer and a reader at Goldsmiths College of the University of London. In 2013, he accepted a professorship at the London School of Economics.

Graeber was a founding member of the Institute for Experimental Arts in Greece. He gave a lecture with the title &quot;How social and economic structure influences the Art World&quot; in the International MultiMedia Poetry Festival organized by the Institute for Experimental Arts supported by the Department of Anthropology of the London School of Economics and Political Science.

== Scholarship ==
Graeber is the author of &quot;Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology&quot; and &quot;Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams&quot;. He conducted extensive anthropological work in Madagascar, writing his doctoral thesis, &quot;The Disastrous Ordeal of 1987: Memory and Violence in Rural Madagascar&quot;, on the continuing social division between the descendants of nobles and the descendants of former slaves. A book based on his dissertation, &quot;Lost People: Magic and the Legacy of Slavery in Madagascar&quot;, was published by Indiana University Press in September 2007. A book of collected essays, &quot;&quot; was published by AK Press in November 2007, and &quot;Direct Action: An Ethnography&quot; appeared from the same press in August 2009. Moreover, the aforementioned publisher printed a collection of essays by Graeber – co-edited with Stevphen Shukaitis and Erika Biddle – called &quot;Constituent Imagination: Militant Investigations/Collective Theorization&quot; (AK Press, May 2007).

In December 2017, Graeber and his former teacher Marshall Sahlins released a collection of essays entitled &quot;On Kings&quot;, outlining a theory, inspired by A. M. Hocart, of the origins of human sovereignty in cosmological ritual. Graeber contributed essays on the Shilluk and Merina kingdoms, and a final essay that explored what he called &quot;the constitutive war between king and people&quot;. He was working on a historical work on the origins of social inequality with David Wengrow, published posthumously as &quot;The Dawn of Everything&quot;.

From January 2013 until June 2016, Graeber was a contributing editor at &quot;The Baffler&quot; magazine in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he, too, participated in the public debate about futures of technology. From 2011 until 2017 he was editor-at-large of the open access journal &quot;&quot;, for which he and Giovanni da Col co-wrote the founding theoretical statement and manifesto of the school of &quot;ethnographic theory&quot;.

Charles Kenny, writing in the political magazine &quot;Democracy&quot;, claimed that Graeber sought out data that &quot;fit the narrative on the evils of neoliberalism&quot; and challenged or criticized data which suggested otherwise.

=== &quot;Debt: The First 5000 Years&quot; ===

Graeber&#x27;s first major historical monograph was &quot;&quot; (2011).

Karl Schmid, writing in the Canadian Anthropology Society&#x27;s journal &quot;Anthropologica&quot;, described &quot;Debt&quot; as an &quot;unusual book&quot; which &quot;may be the most read public anthropology book of the 21st century&quot; and noted that &quot;it will be difficult for Graeber or anyone else to top this book for the attention it received due to excellent timing&quot;. Schmid compared &quot;Debt&quot; to Jared Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; and James C. Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Not Being Governed&quot; for its &quot;vast scope and implication&quot;. However, Schmid expressed minor frustrations with the sheer length of the book, and the fact that Graeber raises many claims and examples which he does not go on to develop in full.

J. Bradford DeLong, an economic historian, criticized &quot;Debt&quot; on his blog, alleging mistakes in the book. Graeber responded that these errors had no influence on his argument, remarking that the &quot;biggest actual mistake DeLong managed to detect in the 544 pages of &quot;Debt&quot;, despite years of flailing away, was (iirc) that I got the number of Presidential appointees on the Federal Open Market Committee board wrong&quot;. He dismissed his other criticisms as representing a divergence of interpretation, truncation of his arguments by DeLong, and mistakes in the copy editing of the book.

=== Bureaucracy, managerialism, and &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; ===

Much of Graeber&#x27;s later scholarship focused on the topic of &quot;bullshit jobs&quot;, proliferated by administrative bloat and what Graeber calls &quot;managerial feudalism&quot;. One of the points he raised in his 2013 book &quot;The Democracy Project&quot;—on the Occupy movement—is the increase in what he calls &quot;bullshit jobs&quot;, referring to forms of employment that even those holding the jobs feel should not or do not need to exist. He sees such jobs as being typically &quot;concentrated in professional, managerial, clerical, sales, and service workers&quot;. As he explained also in an article in &quot;STRIKE!&quot;: &quot;Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed&quot;.

Because of the article&#x27;s popularity, Graeber then wrote the book &quot;Bullshit Jobs: A Theory&quot;, published in 2018 by Simon &amp; Schuster. Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Nathan Heller described the resulting book as having &quot;the virtue of being both clever and charismatic&quot;. Reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Alana Semuels noted that although it could be criticized for generalizations about economics &quot;Graeber&#x27;s anthropological eye and skepticism about capitalism are useful in questioning some parts of the economy that the West has come to accept as normal.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave a mixed review of Graeber&#x27;s &quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot;, accusing him of having a &quot;slightly condescending attitude&quot; and attesting to the book&#x27;s &quot;laboured arguments&quot;, while referring to aspects of the book&#x27;s thesis as &quot;clearly right&quot;. &quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot; spent four weeks in the top 20 of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; bestseller list.

== Activism ==
In addition to his academic work, Graeber was directly and indirectly involved in political activism. He was a member of the labor union Industrial Workers of the World, protested at the World Economic Forum in New York City in 2002, supported the 2010 UK student protests, and played an early role in the Occupy Wall Street movement. He was co-founder of the Anti-Capitalist Convergence.

Graeber became a strong advocate of the democratic confederalism of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria after visiting the region in 2014, often drawing parallels between it and the Spanish Revolution his father fought for in the 1930s.

On October 11, 2019, Graeber spoke at an Extinction Rebellion protest in Trafalgar Square about the relationship between &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; and environmental harm, suggesting that the environmental movement should recognize these jobs in combination with unnecessary construction or infrastructure projects and planned obsolescence as significant issues.

=== Occupy movement ===

In November 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credited Graeber with giving the Occupy Wall Street movement its theme: &quot;We are the 99 percent&quot;. Graeber wrote in &quot;The Democracy Project&quot; that the slogan &quot;was a collective creation&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said he helped create the first New York City General Assembly, with only 60 participants, on August 2. He spent the next six weeks involved with the burgeoning movement, including facilitating general assemblies, attending working group meetings, and organizing legal and medical training and classes on nonviolent resistance. A few days after the encampment of Zuccotti Park began, he left New York for Austin, Texas.

Graeber argued that the Occupy Wall Street movement&#x27;s lack of recognition of the legitimacy of either existing political institutions or the legal structure, its embrace of non-hierarchical consensus decision-making and of prefigurative politics made it a fundamentally anarchist project. Comparing it to the Arab Spring, he claimed that Occupy Wall Street and other contemporary grassroots protests represented &quot;the opening salvo in a wave of negotiations over the dissolution of the American Empire.&quot; Writing in &quot;Al Jazeera&quot;, he noted that from the beginning the Occupy movement was about a &quot;commitment to answer only to a moral order, not a legal one&quot; and so held meetings without the requisite permits. Defending this early decision of the Occupy movement, he said, &quot;as the public, we should not need permission to occupy public space&quot;.

Graeber tweeted in 2014 that he had been evicted from his family&#x27;s home of over 50 years due to his involvement with Occupy Wall Street. He added that others associated with Occupy had received similar &quot;administrative harassment&quot;.

===British politics===
In November 2019, along with other public figures, Graeber signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, calling him &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot; Graeber, who was Jewish, also defended Corbyn from accusations of antisemitism, saying that &quot;What actually threatens Jews, the people who actually want to kill us, are Nazis&quot;, and that the allegations represented a &quot;weaponization&quot; of antisemitism for political purposes.

Graeber advocated for a boycott of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper by fellow left-wing authors after alleging that the paper published distortions against Corbyn for years. He denounced what he claimed was the weaponization of antisemitism for political purposes, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s alleged role in undermining Corbyn in the 2019 election, which, according to Graeber, resulted in a landslide victory for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. He asserted that &quot;The Guardian&quot; only publishes progressive authors in order to gain credibility with its readership, but its editorial policy is at odds with socialist politics. He was a vocal critic of the Labour centrists who attacked Corbyn, stating their disdain for socialist movements was due to their previously selling-out: &quot;If those activists were not naive, if this man was not unelectable, the centrists&#x27; entire lives had been a lie. They hadn&#x27;t really accepted reality at all. They really were just sellouts.&quot;

== Influence and reception ==
Kate Burrell wrote, in the journal &quot;Sociology&quot;, that Graeber&#x27;s work &quot;promotes anarchist visions of social change, which are not quite believed possible by the Left, yet are lived out within social movements every day&quot; and that his work &quot;offers poetic insight into the daily realities of life as an activist, overtly promotes anarchism, and is a hopeful celebration of just what can be achieved by relatively small groups of committed individuals living their truth visibly.&quot;

Hans Steinmüller, reviewing &quot;On Kings&quot; in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute&quot;, described Graeber and his co-author Marshall Sahlins as &quot;two of the most important anthropological thinkers of our time&quot; and considered their contribution to represent a &quot;benchmark&quot; for the anthropological theory of kingship.

As stated by Penguin Random House editor Tom Penn after Graeber&#x27;s death, &quot;David was a true radical, a pioneer in everything that he did. David&#x27;s inspirational work has changed and shaped the way people understand the world... In his books, his constant, questing curiosity, his wry, sharp-eyed provoking of received nostrums shine through. So too, above all, does his unique ability to imagine a better world, borne out of his own deep and abiding humanity. We are deeply honoured to be his publisher, and we will all miss him: his kindness, his warmth, his wisdom, his friendship. His loss is incalculable, but his legacy is immense. His work and his spirit will live on.&quot;

==Personal life==
After a relationship with anthropologist Lauren Leve, Graeber later married artist Nika Dubrovsky in 2019. The two collaborated on a series of books, workshops, and conversations called &quot;Anthropology for Kids&quot; and on the Museum of Care, a shared space for communication and social interactions nourishing values of solidarity, care, and reciprocity. According to Graeber&#x27;s website, &quot;The main goal of the Museum of Care is to produce and maintain social relationships.&quot; The concept &quot;museum of care&quot; was coined by Graeber and Dubrovsky in their article &quot;The Museum of Care: imagining the world after the pandemic&quot;, originally published in &quot;Arts of the Working Class&quot; in April 2020. In the article, Graeber and Dubrovsky imagine a post-pandemic future, where vast surfaces of office spaces and conservative institutions are turned into &quot;free city universities, social centers and hotels for those in need of shelter&quot;. &quot;We could call them &#x27;Museums of Care&#x27; – precisely because they are spaces that do not celebrate production of any sort but rather provide the space and means for the creation of social relationships and the imagining of entirely new forms of social relations.&quot;

==Death==
Graeber died suddenly from necrotic pancreatitis on September 2, 2020, while on vacation with his wife and friends in Venice. As his death occurred during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of a funeral, his family organized an &quot;Intergalactic Memorial Carnival&quot; of live-streamed events that took place in October 2020. Dubrovsky attributed the pancreatitis to COVID-19, pointing to his prior good health, strange symptoms they both had for months beforehand, and the connection scientists have since found between COVID-19 and pancreatitis.

<text>David Hedley Ennals, Baron Ennals, (19 August 1922 – 17 June 1995) was a British Labour Party politician and campaigner for human rights. He served as Secretary of State for Social Services from 1976 to 1979.

==Early life and military career==
Born in 1922 in Walsall, Staffordshire to Arthur Ford Ennals and his wife Jessie Edith Taylor, Ennals was educated at Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School, Walsall and the Loomis Institute in Windsor, Connecticut on a one-year student exchange scholarship. In 1939 he was a reporter on the &quot;Walsall Observer&quot;.

In Wolverhampton on his nineteenth birthday, 19 August 1941, he enlisted in the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) and joined 9th Training Battalion (Drivers) at Alfreton. Selected for officer training, he was posted to 162 Officer Cadet Training Unit at Lanark in March 1942.

He was commissioned into the Reconnaissance Corps in September 1942 and posted to the 3rd Regiment Reconnaissance Corps (NF) (3 Recce), part of the 3rd Infantry Division. His service number was 245228. Landing in Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944, Lieutenant Ennals commanded a Contact Detachment providing wireless links between units. On the night of 28/29 June 1944 he went on a night patrol with 1st Battalion Royal Norfolk Regiment who were holding the position to the right of 3 Recce to the north of Caen. The patrol was fired on and returned less Lt Ennals. He was reported as believed to be a prisoner of war. At the beginning of August 1944 Rennes Military Hospital was liberated by US troops. Amongst the patients was Lt Ennals, having been admitted on 3 July with at fracture of his right humerus. He was transferred to a UK hospital on the 14 August and classed as unfit for duty until he was invalided out with the rank of Lieutenant in 1947.

==Political career==
Ennals stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate for Richmond (Surrey) in the 1950 general election and again in 1951. He later joined the Labour Party and served as secretary to the international department at the Labour Party&#x27;s head office.

In 1964 he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Dover. Following the 1966 election, Harold Wilson appointed Ennals as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Army. He moved to become Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in 1967 under James Callaghan before being appointed as a Minister of State in the Department of Health and Social Security in 1968. He lost his government post and his seat following Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 1970 general election. However, in Wilson&#x27;s Resignation Honours, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

Ennals returned to parliament representing Norwich North following the February 1974 general election and was appointed Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. In 1976 he became Secretary of State for Social Services, which he held until Labour lost power in 1979. During his tenure he appointed Sir Douglas Black to produce the Black Report (published in 1980) into health inequality. After losing his seat in the general election of 1983, he was created a life peer, as Baron Ennals, of Norwich in the County of Norfolk.

==Other work==
Following his exit from parliament in 1970, Ennals became Campaign Director for the National Association for Mental Health (MIND), which he served as until 1973. He became chairman in 1984, and served as president from 1989 to 1995.

After serving as secretary to the United Nations Association from 1952 to 1957, he became chairman in 1984, as well as Chairman of the Gandhi Foundation, which he held until 1995. Ennals also served as Chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, from 1960 to 1964, a position that would also be held by his brother John from 1968 to 1976. However, he later came under criticism from the Movement for his involvement in passing the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968.

In 1987 Lord Ennals went on a parliamentary fact-finding mission to Tibet and on his return to the UK he became a tireless campaigner for Tibetan independence and a friend of the 14th Dalai Lama. He joined the Tibet Society of the UK, the first Tibet support group in the world, established in 1959, and became its chairman for a number of years. He campaigned energetically and enthusiastically with it and various other UK and international Tibet support groups until his death in 1995.

==Personal life==
Ennals married Eleanor Maud Caddick (born 1924/1925) on 10 June 1950, and they had four children before they divorced in 1977. Later that year he married Katherine Gene Tranoy (born 1926/1927).

Ennals had an older brother, John and a younger brother Martin Ennals, who was a human rights activist and Secretary-General of Amnesty International. His son, Sir Paul Ennals, is chief executive of the National Children&#x27;s Bureau.

He died in 1995 of pancreatic cancer at his home in Belsize Park, London.

<text>Arthur-Virden is a former provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1989, combining the former constituencies of Arthur and Virden.

Arthur-Virden was located in the southwestern corner of the province. It was bordered to the north by Riding Mountain, to the east by Spruce Woods, to the west by the province of Saskatchewan and to the south by the American state of North Dakota.

Communities in the former riding included Virden, Elkhorn, Oak Lake, Hartney, Deloraine, Melita, Reston, and Boissevain.

In 1999, the average family income was $41,338, and the unemployment rate was 4.80%. The former riding is primarily agrarian, with agriculture accounting for 32% of its industry.

Ten per cent of Arthur-Virden&#x27;s residents listed German as their ethnic background. The former riding had one of the highest rates of senior citizens in the province, with 19.7% of the total population.

Arthur-Virden, and the two ridings from which it was formed, were Progressive Conservative seats from 1953 to its dissolution in 2018. The northern chunk of Arthur-Virden was absorbed by Riding Mountain, and its southern portion joined with that of Spruce Woods and Midland to form the new riding of Turtle Mountain. Doyle Piwniuk was the last for Arthur-Virden, and was re-elected in the 2019 election as the MLA for the newly-formed Turtle Mountain.

<doc id="1292470" wikidata="Q925352" url="?curid=1292470" title="Revolving restaurant">
<text>A revolving restaurant or rotating restaurant is a tower restaurant designed to rest atop a broad circular revolving that operates as a large turntable. The building remains stationary and the diners are carried on the revolving floor. The revolving rate varies between one and three times per hour and enables patrons to enjoy a panoramic view without leaving their seats. Such restaurants are often located on upper stories of hotels, communication towers, and skyscrapers.

== Design and construction ==

Revolving restaurants are designed as a circular structure, with a platform that rotates around a core in the center. The center core contains the building&#x27;s elevators, kitchens, or other features. The restaurant itself rests on a thin steel platform, with the platform sitting on top of a series of wheels connected to the floor of the structure. Alternatively, some designs, like one in Memphis, Tennessee, have the platform mounted on tires. A motor rotates the restaurant at less than one horsepower. The speed of rotation is noted to vary, depending on preference.

==History==
It is believed that Emperor Nero had a rotating dining room in his palace Domus Aurea on the Palatine Hill with a magnificent view on the Forum Romanum and Colosseum. Archaeologists unearthed what they believed to be evidence of such a dining room in 2009.

Architect and designer Norman Bel Geddes proposed a rotating restaurant for the Century of Progress, the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, although it was not built.

A barrel-shaped, but stationary, restaurant on Fernsehturm Stuttgart, a TV tower in Stuttgart, Germany, built in 1956, was noted as the inspiration for the idea of a revolving restaurant. A revolving restaurant on Florianturm, a TV tower in Dortmund, Germany, was brought into service in 1959.

The Egyptian architect Naoum Shebib designed the Cairo Tower with a revolving restaurant at its top, which opened in April 1961.

The first revolving restaurant in the Balkans was built on the top floor of the OTE tower as part of the 34th Thessaloniki International Fair in 1965. The revolving restaurant was then closed, but has been in continued service since 1969. 

John Graham, a Seattle architect and early shopping mall pioneer, is said to be the first in the United States to design a revolving restaurant, at La Ronde, atop an office building at the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu in 1961. Graham was awarded US patent 3125189 for the invention in 1964, and used the technology to build the former revolving &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; restaurant at the top of Seattle&#x27;s Space Needle, drawings of which appear in the patent application.

==Safety==
One death has been attributed to the operation of a rotating restaurant. On April 14, 2017, a five-year-old boy was wedged between the rotating part of the restaurant and a wall at the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

<text>The Stickeen Territories , also colloquially rendered as Stickeen Territory, Stikine Territory, and Stikeen Territory, was a territory of British North America whose brief existence began July 19, 1862, and concluded July of the following year. The region was split from the North-Western Territory in the wake of the Stikine Gold Rush. The initial strike attracted large numbers of miners — mostly American — to the region; by detaching the region from the exclusive trade zone of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, British authorities were able to impose tariffs and licences on the speculators. The new territory, named after the Stikine River, was under the responsibility of the Governor of the Colony of British Columbia, James Douglas, who was appointed &quot;Administrator of the Stickeen Territories&quot; and under British law, within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of British Columbia.

The boundaries of the Stickeen Territories were the 62nd parallel to the north, the 125th meridian to the east, the Nass and Finlay Rivers to the south, and the panhandle of Russian America to the west (only vaguely defined by treaty and disputed until resolved with the Alaska Boundary Settlement of 1903).

A year later, the Stickeen Territories was dissolved, most of its former land being added to the Colony of British Columbia, except for the sector north of the 60th parallel, which was returned to the North-Western Territory. In 1895, most of this strip was again redistributed, this time to the District of Yukon, as newly constituted during the midst of the Klondike Gold Rush. The remainder of the strip stayed in the Northwest Territories.

<text>Jean Grave (; October 16, 1854, Le Breuil-sur-Couze – December 8, 1939, Vienne-en-Val) was an important activist in the French anarchist and the international anarchist communism movements. He was the editor of three major anarchist periodicals, &quot;Le Révolté&quot;, &quot;La Révolte&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and wrote dozens of pamphlets and a number of important anarchist books.

Grave supported anarchism in the late 1870s, when it first began to emerge as a distinct movement. He was initially a supporter of Jules Guesde&#x27;s Marxist-inspired philosophy. He attended political meetings in Paris before moving in 1883 to Geneva where he was invited by Peter Kropotkin and Elisée Reclus to be the editor of &quot;Le Révolté&quot;, which was renamed &quot;La Révolte&quot; when it moved to Paris in 1886. He edited &quot;La Révolte&quot; from 1887 to 1894. 

In 1893 Grave wrote &quot;La société mourante et l&#x27;anarchie&quot;, prefaced by Octave Mirbeau, for which he was sentenced to two years in prison. Mirbeau, like Élisée Reclus, Paul Adam, and Bernard Lazare had testified on Grave&#x27;s behalf, but to no avail. The trial only popularised the book, which was rapidly translated into German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Yiddish. An English translation by Voltairine De Cleyre appeared in 1899.

Grave was acquitted in the &quot;Trial of the thirty&quot;. 

From 1895 to 1922 Grave was the editor of &quot;Les Temps nouveaux&quot;, which was influential in literary and artistic circles of the time. Many well-known artists (such as Aristide Delannoy, Maximilien Luce, Paul Signac, Alexandre Steinlen, Théo van Rysselberghe, Camille Pissarro, Kees van Dongen, Charles Angrand, Henri-Edmond Cross, George Willaume, etc.) illustrated and helped to finance the review. 

In 1914 Grave joined Kropotkin in England, and incurred the wrath of anti-war anarchists by signing the &quot;Manifesto of the Sixteen&quot;, which supported the allies during World War I.

Grave also wrote &quot;Le Mouvement libertaire sous la IIIe république&quot;.

<doc id="1292484" wikidata="Q1140436" url="?curid=1292484" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō">
<text>Ryūjō ( &quot;Prancing Dragon&quot;) was a light aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the early 1930s. Small and lightly built in an attempt to exploit a loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, she proved to be top-heavy and only marginally stable and was back in the shipyard for modifications to address those issues within a year of completion. With her stability improved, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; returned to service and was employed in operations during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During World War II, she provided air support for operations in the Philippines, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, where her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea. During the Indian Ocean raid in April 1942, the carrier attacked British merchant shipping with her guns and aircraft. &quot;Ryūjō&quot; next participated in the Battle of Dutch Harbor, the opening battle of the Aleutian Islands campaign, in June 1942. She was sunk by American carrier-based aircraft in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942.

==Design==
&quot;Ryūjō&quot; was planned as a light carrier of around standard displacement to exploit a loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 that carriers under standard displacement were not regarded as &quot;aircraft carriers&quot;. While &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was under construction, Article Three of the London Naval Treaty of 1930 closed the above-mentioned loophole; consequently, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was the only light aircraft carrier of her type to be completed by Japan.

&quot;Ryūjō&quot; had a length of overall. with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at standard load and at normal load. Her crew consisted of 600 officers and enlisted men.
To keep &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s weight to 8,000 metric tons, the hull was lightly built with no armor; some protective plating was added abreast the machinery spaces and magazines. She was also designed with only a single hangar, which would have left an extremely low profile (there being just of freeboard amidships and aft). Between the time the carrier was laid down in 1929 and launched in 1931, the Navy doubled her aircraft stowage requirement to 48 in order to give her a more capable air group. This necessitated the addition of a second hangar atop the first, raising freeboard to . Coupled with the ship&#x27;s narrow beam, the consequent top-heaviness made her minimally stable in rough seas, despite the fitting of Sperry active stabilizers. This was a common flaw amongst many treaty-circumventing Japanese warships of her generation.

The &quot;Tomozuru&quot; Incident of 12 March 1934, in which a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to investigate the stability of all their ships, resulting in design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast and shallow torpedo bulges to improve her stability. Her funnels were moved higher up the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.

Shortly afterward, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was one of many Japanese warships caught in a typhoon on 25 September 1935 while on maneuvers during the &quot;Fourth Fleet Incident.&quot; The ship&#x27;s bridge, flight deck and superstructure were damaged and the hangar was flooded. The forecastle was raised one deck and the bow was remodelled with more flare to improve the sea handling. After these modifications, the beam and draft increased to and respectively. The displacement also increased to at standard load and at normal load. The crew also grew to 924 officers and enlisted men.

===Machinery===
The ship was fitted with two geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by six Kampon water-tube boilers. &quot;Ryūjō&quot; had a designed speed of , but reached during her sea trials from . The ship carried of fuel oil, which gave her a range of at . The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ship&#x27;s starboard side amidships and exhausted horizontally below flight deck level through two small funnels.

===Flight deck and hangars===

&quot;Ryūjō&quot; was a flush-decked carrier without an island superstructure; the navigating and control bridge was located just under the forward lip of the flight deck in a long glassed-in &quot;greenhouse&quot;, whilst the superstructure was set back from the ship&#x27;s stem, giving &quot;Ryūjō&quot; a distinctive open bow. The flight deck was wide and extended well beyond the aft end of the superstructure, supported by a pair of pillars. Six transverse arrestor wires were installed on the flight deck and were modernised in 1936 to stop a aircraft. The ship&#x27;s hangars were both long and wide, and had an approximate area of . Between them, they gave the ship the capacity to store 48 aircraft, but only 37 could be operated at one time. After the Fourth Fleet incident, &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s bridge and the leading edge of the flight deck were rounded off to make them more streamlined. This reduced the length of the flight deck by .

Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two elevators; the forward platform measured and the rear . The small rear elevator became a problem as the IJN progressively fielded larger and more modern carrier aircraft. Of all the aircraft in front-line service in 1941, only the Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bomber would fit, when positioned at an angle with its wings folded. This effectively made &quot;Ryūjō&quot; a single-elevator carrier and considerably hindered transfer of aircraft in and out of the hangars for rearming and refueling during combat operations.

===Armament===
As completed, &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s primary anti-aircraft (AA) armament comprised six twin-gun mounts equipped with 40-caliber 12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose guns mounted on projecting sponsons, three on either side of the carrier&#x27;s hull. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Twenty-four anti-aircraft (AA) Type 93 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns were also fitted, in twin and quadruple mounts. Their effective range against aircraft was . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

During the carrier&#x27;s 1934–1936 refit, two of the mountings were exchanged for two twin-gun mounts for license-built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns, resulting in a reduction of approximately of top-weight that improved the ship&#x27;s overall stability. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to &quot;handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, [and] it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast.&quot; These guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the need to frequently change the fifteen-round magazines. The machine guns were replaced during a brief refit in April–May 1942 with six triple-mount AA guns.

==Construction and service==

Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions for aircraft carriers, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was named &quot;Prancing Dragon&quot;. The ship was laid down at the Mitsubishi&#x27;s Yokohama shipyard on 26 November 1929. She was launched on 2 April 1931, towed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 25 April for fitting out, and commissioned on 9 May 1933 with Captain Toshio Matsunaga in command. While training in mid-1933, her initial air group consisted of nine Mitsubishi B1M2 (Type 13) torpedo bombers, plus three spares, and three A1N1 (Type 3) fighters, plus two spares. Matsunaga was relieved by Captain Torao Kuwabara on 20 October. After the Tomozuru Incident, the ship was reconstructed from 26 May to 20 August 1934.

Captain Ichiro Ono assumed command on 15 November 1934 and &quot;Ryūjō&quot; became the flagship of Rear Admiral Hideho Wada&#x27;s First Carrier Division. The following month the ship was chosen to evaluate dive-bombing tactics using six Nakajima E4N2-C Type 90 reconnaissance aircraft, six Yokosuka B3Y1 Type 92 torpedo bombers, and a dozen A2N1 Type 90 fighters. The reconnaissance aircraft proved to be unsuitable after several months&#x27; testing. &quot;Ryūjō&quot; participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 where she was attached to the IJN Fourth Fleet. The fleet was caught in a typhoon on 25 September and the ship was moderately damaged. &quot;Ryūjō&quot; arrived at Kure on 11 October 1935 for repairs, modifications, and a refit that lasted until 31 May 1936. On 31 October Ono was relieved by Captain Shun&#x27;ichi Kira.
In mid-1936, the ship was used to evaluate a dozen Aichi D1A dive bombers and dive-bombing tactics. She also embarked at that time 24 A4N1 fighters, plus four and eight spare aircraft respectively. In September, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; resumed her role as flagship of First Carrier Division, now commanded by Rear Admiral Saburō Satō. Her air group now consisted of a mixture of B3Y1 torpedo bombers, D1A1 dive bombers and A2N fighters, but her torpedo bombers were transferred after fleet maneuvers in October demonstrated effective dive bombing tactics. Captain Katsuo Abe assumed command of the ship on 16 November.

The First Carrier Division arrived off Shanghai on 13 August 1937 to support operations of the Japanese Army in China. Her aircraft complement consisted of 12 A4N fighters (plus four spares) and 15 D1A dive bombers. The dive bombers attacked targets in and near Shanghai. The Japanese fighters had their first aerial engagement on 22 August when four A4Ns surprised 18 Nationalist Curtiss Hawk III fighters and claimed to have shot down six without loss. The following day, four A4Ns claimed to have shot down nine Chinese fighters without loss to themselves. The carriers returned to Sasebo at the beginning of September to resupply before arriving off the South China coast on 21 September to attack Chinese forces near Canton. Nine fighters from &quot;Ryūjō&quot; escorted a raid on the city and claimed six of the defending fighters. While escorting another raid later that day, the Japanese pilots claimed five aircraft shot down and one probably shot down. The dive bombers attacked targets near Canton until the ship sailed to the Shanghai area on 3 October. Her air group was flown ashore on 6 October to support Japanese forces near Shanghai and Nanking. &quot;Ryūjō&quot; returned home in November and briefly became a training ship before she was assigned to Rear Admiral Tomoshige Samejima&#x27;s Second Carrier Division.

In February 1938 the ship replaced her A4N biplanes with nine Mitsubishi A5M &quot;Claude&quot; monoplane fighters. The division supported Japanese operations in Southern China in March–April and again in October. Captain Kiichi Hasegawa assumed command on 15 November 1939. &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was given a refit that lasted from December 1939 through January 1940 and became a training ship until November when she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta&#x27;s Third Carrier Division. Hasegawa was relieved by Captain Ushie Sugimoto on 21 June. The ship&#x27;s air group then consisted of 18 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 16 A5M4 fighters. When the First Air Fleet was formed on 10 April 1941, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; became flagship of the Fourth Carrier Division.

=== World War II ===

The ship&#x27;s assignment at the beginning of the Pacific War was to support the invasion of the Philippines, initially by attacking the American naval base at Davao, Mindanao, on the morning of 8 December. Her air group had not changed, but four of each type of aircraft were spares. &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller airstrike later in the day by two B5Ns and three A5Ms. They accomplished little, destroying two Consolidated PBY seaplanes on the ground for the loss of one B5N and one A5M. The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British oil tanker south of Davao. In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the Malay Peninsula.

In mid-February 1942, &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s aircraft attacked ships evacuating from Singapore, claiming eight ships damaged, three burnt, and four sunk. They also covered convoys carrying troops to Sumatra. The ship was unsuccessfully attacked by several Bristol Blenheim light bombers of No. 84 Squadron RAF on 14 February. The following day two waves of B5Ns, totaling 13 aircraft, attacked the British heavy cruiser , but managed only to damage the ship&#x27;s Supermarine Walrus seaplane. Follow-on attacks the same day were also unsuccessful. Two days later, B5Ns destroyed , a Dutch destroyer that had run aground in the Gaspar Strait and been abandoned on 14 February. The carrier sailed to Saigon, French Indochina, the next day and arrived on 20 February. A week later she was assigned to cover the convoy taking troops to Jakarta, Java. Her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March and six B5Ns sank the American destroyer after it had been abandoned by its crew. Six other B5Ns bombed the port of Semarang, possibly setting one merchantman on fire.

&quot;Ryūjō&quot; arrived in Singapore on 5 March and the ship supported operations in Sumatra and escorted convoys to Burma and the Andaman Islands for the rest of the month. On 1 April, while the 1st Air Fleet was starting its raid in the Indian Ocean, Malay Force, consisting of &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, six cruisers, and four destroyers, left Burma on a mission to destroy merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal. B5Ns damaged one freighter on 5 April before the force split into three groups. &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s aircraft bombed the small ports of Cocanada and Vizagapatam on the southeastern coast of India the next day, doing little damage, in addition to claiming two ships sunk and six more damaged during the day. The carrier and her escorts, the light cruiser and the destroyer , claimed to have sunk three more ships by gunfire. All together, Malay Force sank 19 ships totaling almost , before reuniting on 7 April and arriving at Singapore on 11 April. A week later, her B5Ns were detached for torpedo training and the ship arrived at Kure on 23 April for a brief refit.

The newly commissioned carrier joined Carrier Division 4, under the command of Kakuta, with &quot;Ryūjō&quot; on 3 May 1942. They formed the core of the 2nd Carrier Strike Force, part of the Northern Force, tasked to attack the Aleutian Islands, an operation planned to seize several of the islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while the main body of the American fleet was occupied defending Midway. &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s air group now consisted of 12 A6M2 Zeros and 18 B5Ns, plus two spares of each type. The ship transferred to Mutsu Bay on 25 May and then to Paramushiro on 1 June before departing the same day for the Aleutians.

At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 B5Ns, escorted by 6 Zeros, to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. One B5N crashed on takeoff but 6 of the B5Ns and all of the Zeros were able to make it through the bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the oil storage tanks and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from &quot;Ryūjō&quot; from the second strike was damaged by a Curtiss P-40 and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the Akutan Zero, remained largely intact and was later salvaged by the U.S. Navy and test flown. On the following day, the two carriers launched another airstrike, consisting of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns, which successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.

&quot;Ryūjō&quot; arrived back at Mutsu Bay on 24 June, and departed for the Aleutians four days later to cover the second reinforcement convoy to Attu and Kiska Islands and remained in the area until 7 July in case of an American counterattack. She arrived at Kure on 13 July for a refit and was transferred to Carrier Division 2 a day later.

==== Battle of the Eastern Solomons ====

The American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August caught the Japanese by surprise. The next day, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was transferred to Carrier Division 1 and departed for Truk on 16 August together with the other two carriers of the division, and . Her air group consisted of 24 Zeros and nine B5N2s. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, ordered Truk to be bypassed and the fleet refueled at sea after an American carrier was spotted near the Solomon Islands on 21 August. At 01:45 on 24 August, Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, commander of the Mobile Force, ordered &quot;Ryūjō&quot; and the heavy cruiser , escorted by two destroyers, detached to move in advance of the troop convoy bound for Guadalcanal and to attack the Allied air base at Henderson Field if no carriers were spotted. This Detached Force was commanded by Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara in &quot;Tone&quot;.

&quot;Ryūjō&quot; launched two small airstrikes, totaling 6 B5Ns and 15 Zeros, beginning at 12:20 once the Diversionary Force was north of Lunga Point. Four Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters from Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-223 on combat air patrol (CAP) near Henderson Field spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft around 14:20 and alerted the defenders. Ten more Wildcats from VMF-223 and VMF-212 scrambled, as well as 2 United States Army Air Corps Bell P-400s from the 67th Fighter Squadron in response. Nine of the Zeros strafed the airfield while the B5Ns bombed it with bombs to little effect. The Americans claimed to have shot down 19 aircraft, but only three Zeros and three B5Ns were lost, with another B5N forced to crash-land. Only three Wildcats were shot down in turn.

Around 14:40, the Detached Force was spotted again by several search aircraft from the carrier ; the Japanese ships did not immediately spot the Americans. They launched three Zeros for a combat air patrol at 14:55, three minutes before two of the searching Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers narrowly missed &quot;Ryūjō&quot; astern with four bombs. Two more Zeros reinforced the patrol shortly after 15:00, just in time to intercept two more searching Avengers, shooting down one. In the meantime, the carrier had launched an airstrike against the Detached Force in the early afternoon that consisted of 31 Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and eight Avengers; the long range precluded fighter escort. They found the carrier shortly afterward and attacked. They hit &quot;Ryūjō&quot; three times with bombs and one torpedo; the torpedo hit flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms. No aircraft from either &quot;Ryūjō&quot; or &quot;Saratoga&quot; were shot down in the attack.

The bomb hits set the carrier on fire and she took on a list from the flooding caused by the torpedo hit. &quot;Ryūjō&quot; turned north at 14:08, but her list continued to increase even after the fires were put out. The progressive flooding disabled her machinery and caused her to stop at 14:20. The order to abandon ship was given at 15:15 and the destroyer moved alongside to rescue the crew. The ships were bombed several times by multiple B-17s without effect before &quot;Ryūjō&quot; capsized about 17:55 at coordinates with the loss of seven officers and 113 crewmen. Fourteen aircraft that she had dispatched on raids returned shortly after &quot;Ryūjō&quot; sank and circled over the force until they were forced to ditch. Seven pilots were rescued.

<text>Paraparaumu () is a town in the south-western North Island of New Zealand. It lies on the Kāpiti Coast, north of the nation&#x27;s capital city, Wellington. It is also known to residents as Pram or Paraparam.

Like other towns in the area, it has a partner settlement at the coast called [[Paraparaumu Beach]], which is directly opposite Kapiti Island. The two towns form part of the Kāpiti Coast District. Together with the nearby Raumati Beach and Raumati South they are among the fastest-growing urban areas in New Zealand, and are major dormitory towns with workers commuting to the cities that make up the Wellington urban area. The four towns between them have a 2012 population of over 49,000 people. Inland behind Paraparaumu is the Maungakotukutuku area.

Paraparaumu is a Māori-language name meaning &quot;scraps from an earth oven&quot;; means &quot;dirt&quot; or &quot;scraps&quot;, and means &quot;oven&quot;.

The village of Lindale is just north of the Paraparaumu town centre. It began as a Tourist and Agricultural Centre, but later gained a reputation for cheese and the Lindale Barnyard petting farm.

The old State Highway 1 and the Kapiti Line section of the North Island Main Trunk railway both pass through Lindale. The railway line was formerly owned by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, and construction of the line was completed when the ends from Wellington and Longburn (Palmerston North) met near Lindale in Otaihanga in 1886. There were proposals to extend the commuter train service operated by Transdev Wellington to a new station at Lindale, subject to Wellington Regional Council funding, but these were dropped when electrification for the commuter service was extended from Paraparaumu to Waikanae.

The majority of shops are located close to the town centre in the Coastlands Mall, close to the train station.

== Name and etymology ==
&quot;Parapara&quot; refers in Māori to food waste, and &quot;umu&quot; is ovens that they are cooked in. The name Paraparaumu comes from an 1819–1820 expedition of Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Toa, who on the west coast of the North Island from Kāwhia to Cook Strait. As they arrived in the Kāpiti Coast, they found no useful resources.

Paraparaumu is sometimes known by the names &quot;Pram&quot;, &quot;Paraparam&quot; or &quot;Pram-Pram&quot;.

== History ==
In August 1936 a train derailed in Paraparaumu as it approached a land slide in rainy weather.

<text>Analord is a series of eleven 12&quot; vinyl records by the electronic music artist Richard D. James, most of which are released under the alias AFX. The series, released in 2005, marked James&#x27;s return to primarily analogue equipment following his computer-oriented programming work in the late 1990s. After their release, James &quot;distilled&quot; the 3½-hour, 42-track series into the 10-track compilation album &quot;Chosen Lords&quot; (2006), effectively his first full-length release since the 2001 album &quot;Drukqs&quot;.

On 24 December 2009 the Rephlex Records website began posting unreleased/bonus tracks for the &quot;Analord&quot; series in MP3 and WAV digital formats. In all, 21 bonus tracks were added to the series, totalling 62 tracks for a runtime of four hours and 36 minutes.

==History==
The first installment, &quot;Analord 10&quot;, went on sale through the Rephlex Records website on 15 December 2004, and was packaged in a faux-leather binder with sleeves for housing the rest of the series. It was later re-released as a picture disc. Both pressings of &quot;Analord 10&quot; were marketed under James&#x27; primary alias Aphex Twin, although other &quot;Analord&quot; recordings were released under the AFX pseudonym.

A condensed, album-length version of the series, &quot;Chosen Lords&quot;, was released in 2006.

==Musical equipment used==
James has programmed a variety of analogue equipment throughout his career. Instruments on &quot;Analord&quot; include drum machines such as the Roland TR-606, TR-808, and TR-909; sequencers such as the Roland MC-4; and various synthesizers and polysynths, including the Roland SH-101 and Roland TB-303, a Synton Fenix Modular.

==Allusions==
*Tracks on &quot;Analord 8&quot;, &quot;Analord 9&quot;, and &quot;Analord 11&quot; are named after computer viruses and other malicious software, allegedly to prevent or discourage file sharing.
*The images on both sides of &quot;Analord 11&quot; feature the Michael Faraday Memorial in Elephant and Castle, London (which is near the disused bank Richard D. James owns). 
* Both sides of &quot;Analord 1&quot; feature the Roland MC-4 Microcomposer as the label art.
* Side B of &quot;Analord 4&quot; has a Halibut&#x27;s eye as the label art, connecting with the track &quot;Halibut Acid&quot;.

<text>Emmett Grogan (born Eugene Leo Grogan, November 28, 1942 – April 6, 1978) was a founder of the Diggers, a radical community-action group of Improvisational actors in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. The Diggers took their name from the English Diggers (1649–1650), a radical movement opposed to feudalism, the Church of England and the British Crown.

== Biography ==
Grogan&#x27;s distrust of the mainstream media made it difficult for reporters to acquire more than a few details of his life. He was born on November 28, 1942, as Eugene Leo Grogan into an Irish-American family in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. According to his publisher, New York Review Books, &quot;Grogan grew up on New York City’s mean streets, getting hooked on heroin before he was in his teens, kicking the habit and winning a scholarship to a swanky Manhattan private school, pursuing a highly profitable sideline as a Park Avenue burglar, then skipping town to enjoy the dolce vita in Italy.&quot; After high school, he attended Duke University for one year before moving to San Francisco. 

The San Francisco Diggers were a legendary group that evolved out of two radical traditions that thrived in the Bay Area in the mid-1960s: the bohemian/underground art/theater scene, and the New Left/civil rights/peace movement. The Diggers combined street theatre, direct action, and art happenings in their social agenda of creating a Free City. Their most famous activities revolved around distributing free food (&quot;Free because it&#x27;s yours!&quot;) every day in Golden Gate Park, and distributing &quot;surplus energy&quot; at a series of Free Stores (where everything in stock was without a price tag).

The Diggers coined various slogans that became part of the counterculture and even the larger society, such as, &quot;Do your own thing,&quot; and &quot;Today is the first day of the rest of your life.&quot;

Grogan&#x27;s 1972 autobiography &quot;Ringolevio, a Life Played for Keeps&quot;, is regarded by some as the best and only authentic book written about the underground culture of the 1960s. In the book, Grogan refers to himself by the alias Kenny Wisdom. Peter Coyote, in the 1990 introduction to &quot;Ringolevio&quot; states that Grogan&#x27;s choice of that alias is &quot;no accident&quot; but without elaborating.

Grogan was also the author of &quot;Final Score,&quot; a crime novel published in 1976.

==Criticism of counterculture==
Grogan shunned media attention and became increasingly suspicious of those who sought publicity. In &quot;Ringolevio&quot;, Grogan discussed the 1967 Human Be-In, criticizing counterculture luminaries Timothy Leary, Jerry Rubin, and especially Abbie Hoffman.

Grogan thought the HIP (Haight Independent Proprietors) merchants, led by Ron and Jay Thelin, who had sponsored events like the Human Be-In, were the primary beneficiaries of the events: &quot;The HIP merchants were astounded by their own triumph by promoting such a large market for their wares. They became the Western world&#x27;s taste makers overnight...&quot; He objected to the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; enticing of young people to the Haight-Ashbury to experience hippie life, noting that an influx of residents would cause an &quot;immigration crisis&quot; and the kids who came expecting an already-formed Utopia would end up living a desperate hand-to-mouth existence on the streets. He also decried the HIP merchants&#x27; &quot;HIP Job Co-Op,&quot; revealing that much of the work they offered was sweatshop labor. He pointed out that unskilled and clerical jobs would be taken away from poor residents who depended on such work to survive.

== Death ==
On April 6, 1978, 35-year-old Grogan was found dead on a New York City Subway train on the F train in Coney Island; he had suffered a heart attack. Close friend and Digger co-founder Peter Coyote stated in his foreword to Grogan&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Ringolevio&quot; that his death was due to a heroin overdose.

Bob Dylan dedicated his 1978 album &quot;Street Legal&quot; to Grogan. Richard Brautigan dedicated his poem &quot;Death Is a Beautiful Car Parked Only&quot; to Grogan.

== Personal life ==
Grogan was married to the French-Canadian actress Louise Latraverse; they had one son.

<text>The Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum is the former residence and farmlet of Australian artist Norman Lindsay. Now an art gallery, tourist attraction and museum located at 14–20 Norman Lindsay Crescent in the Blue Mountains town of Faulconbridge in the City of Blue Mountains local government area of New South Wales, Australia, it was built from 1898 to 1913 by Francis Foy, Patrick Ryan, Lindsay, and the artist&#x27;s wife, Rose Lindsay (nee Soady). The property, owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) (Community Group), is also known as Maryville and Springwood.

The site includes a stone cottage home on a and several smaller buildings, including two used by Lindsay as an oil painting studio and an etching studio. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.

The 1994 film &quot;Sirens&quot;, based on Lindsay&#x27;s work and life, was filmed at the home and studio.

== History ==
The property was originally owned by Patrick Ryan, a local stonemason. In 1898 he sold the land, then called &quot;Erin-go-Braugh&quot; to Francis Foy, brother of Mark Foy, a Sydney entrepreneur. Soon after Foy commissioned Ryan to build a sandstone cottage, which his family used as a halfway house between Sydney and Medlow Bath, where Mark Foy owned the holiday retreat, The Hydro Majestic.

The house, renamed &quot;Maryville&quot;, was a small four bedroom construction with a roof covering of French tiles and a corrugated galvanised iron bullnosed verandah painted with red and white stripes, wooden support posts and iron lace brackets. There was a bow window on the left of the front door and a double hung sash window on the other side of the door. Because of the potential fire risk, the kitchen was a separate building. The kitchen was constructed from a different stone to that of the main building and was located on the highest point of the property. This siting suggests that perhaps the kitchen was the first building constructed, even when Ryan owed the property.

The front of the verandah was enclosed by a dry stone wall, which was later added to, as illustrated by the differing construction techniques. On the inside of the wall, in between the front gate and the driveway entrance, was a semi circular concrete bench under a gum tree. On one end was an iron urn and at the other was a circular stone with a hole in the middle. As it was not a very sound structure, it had been demolished by the 1930s. During this time the Foys owned the property, a number of outbuildings were constructed. A two bedroom cottage with a bathroom, verandah, and an open fireplace, known during the Lindsay era as &quot;The Camp&quot; was built as servants quarters. There was also a weatherboard structure to the west of &quot;The Camp&quot;. although it is unclear whether this was built by the Foys or in the very early Lindsay years. This shed structure consisted of a stable, feed room, buggy shed, tool shed, milking bails and yards.

===Purchase by the Lindsay family===
The property was discovered by Norman Lindsay and Rose Soady in a dilapidated and overgrown state in 1912, and was subsequently purchased by Rose at the end of that year. Throughout 1913, many renovations were made to the building. Initially, new floorboards were laid to replace old ones, which had been eaten by termites. Then major constructions began, with the help of numerous locals including the Stattons. The bullnosed verandah and wooden posts were removed and replaced with an extended verandah covered with tiles imported from France to match those on the main roof. At the north eastern side, a two-foot wall was constructed on the outside edge of the verandah, approximately halfway along that side and green wooden venetian blinds were added to the front and side to make a sleep-out. Norman&#x27;s design meant that the pitch of the roof was carried through to the verandah, and in conjunction with his interest in the classics, he cast many Grecian Ionic columns for supports.

It was also at this time that the wall between the two southwestern rooms was removed, thus creating the drawing room. The original bow window was also replaced with a pair of lead light French doors. Recesses were also made within the walls to accommodate Normans art works.

At the same time temporary wooden studio was built under a Moreton Bay Fig, where the courtyard is today. Whilst Lindsay used this studio, the construction of a more permanent sandstone studio was under way to the west of the main building, and further down the hill. This studio was a one-room construction with a closed verandah. This first studio was to later become the Etching Studio. Further down the hill were steps leading to a rectangular Roman style bath, apparently a pre-Lindsay installation on the location of a natural spring. It is possible that the bath was a Foy installation and a result of the family&#x27;s interest in hydrotherapy.

It was not until 1915 that it was realised that the land on which the etching studio was constructed was not part of their property, so in 1916 the Lindsays rushed to Sydney to purchase the seven acres adjoining block, before the &quot;actual&quot; owners realised that there was a building on their property.

This period also saw the beginning of Norman Lindsay&#x27;s project of populating the bush landscape of Springwood with nude statues. The first statue, of a female nude standing upright in an urn, was constructed and installed before the major works on the verandah began. Soon after the completion of the verandah and the front steps, Norman constructed two standing female nudes, which were placed on either side of the steps.

Between 1914 and 1916 construction of the swimming pool and the landscaping of the surrounding bush was in progress. The back wall of the pool was laid on bedrock, under which water seeped. There were also two cracks due to the formwork being taken away too soon. The filtration system consisted of fine wire netting through which the water flowed. The water was run off the property. There were also numerous terraces placed within the surrounding hillside, perhaps reflecting the influence that the English Romantic movement and notions of Arcadia had on Norman Lindsay&#x27;s planning endeavors.

Soon after the completion of the swimming pool in 1916, the statue of seated women was installed at its edge. At the same time the statue of the &quot;Satyr Pursuing the Nymph&quot; was constructed and positioned in its current location. The statue of the nude with her hands behind her head as also of this era, though it was perhaps originally placed in another location and moved in the late 1930s.

In 1918, the present painting studio was built by Norman Lindsay and Percy Louden, a local man who worked on the property. In its original state, the studio was a one-room building, assembled from concrete and coke breeze bricks made by Lindsay. There was also a first level deck on the northeastern side, to which access was gained by a ladder through a trapdoor in the ceiling of the building still remaining. The deck had rigging of screens and an umbrella, but it was abandoned due to the lack of protection from the elements. It was at this time also that previous studio was dedicated solely to the production of etchings, reflecting the changing direction in Norman&#x27;s art.

A statue installation of this time was that of the woman bending to dry her hair which was originally positioned directly in front of the new studio. It would have been soon after this that a bust was added to a head that was given to Norman by Francis Crossle, and which was subsequently installed to the left of NTA No 673. Later another bust was produced to match this one and was placed on the right hand side of NTA No 637, in front of the opening in the trellis which ran behind this statue group and in front of the studio. This trellis also hid the outhouse.

1920 brought the marriage of Norman and Rose and within two weeks the birth of their first child, Jane. This led to major changes to the house and grounds, and is perhaps this year that was one of the most important in terms the site&#x27;s development.

The principal change was the addition of the four rooms at the rear of the main building. The four rooms consisted of a nursery on the northeast end. In keeping with Norman&#x27;s original design, the roof and four rooms maintained the slope of the main buildings roof leading to the problem of very low perimeter ceilings in these rooms. At this time the bathroom was also built next to the kitchen, and the sleepout was glazed. The laundry was also in existence, which remains now in the form of the men&#x27;s toilets. The Studio also underwent changes with the addition of a small fibro-asbestos storeroom at the back. Within this storeroom was a darkroom, with red and green windowpanes which could be dropped into places as required during film processing. Two years later a small bedroom was added, extending towards the northwest with a shed behind it, thus replacing the first floor deck.

In 1924 also bought major changes to the building. Initially a kitchen and the bathroom were renovated and tiled in a style designed by Rose. The original hexagonal pattern now remains only within the pantry adjacent the kitchen currently used as a storeroom. At this time Rose also tiled all the doorsteps, the fireplace, front steps and outside toilet. Contemporaneously with these renovations a temporary corrugated galvanised iron structure was erected west of original kitchen to house the old small fuel stove.

The most important development of this period was the construction of the courtyard behind the spare room and sewing room, and west of the kitchen. A high wall was constructed on the southwest end, which was blind except for small square windows on either side of the storeroom. The building of this storeroom which still serves its original function was undertaken during a period which was one of the most productive times for Norman and his art. Verandahs were constructed on the opposing northwest and southeast facing walls. The verandah supports are wooden posts with concrete bases, and when the courtyard was completed, awnings were added to the northwest facing verandah roof. It was at this time that a skylight was added to the sewing room due to the lack of light resulting from the courtyard construction.

Soon after, the Balinese dancer statue was installed as a centrepiece to the open grass area in the courtyard space, which was used from this time as the main entertaining area. Around this time in 1924, the statue of the women holding her breasts was constructed, and placed on a bench, which had first been constructed in the 1910s. The passageway from the dining room to the kitchen was also built at this time, with a gauze doorway giving access to both the courtyard and the Isabella grapevine pergola on the other side. This pergola extended across from the edge of the kitchen roof to the edge of the nursery roof, and must have been installed and planted soon after the construction of a garage next to the existing shed.

1928 had under taken numerous other developments. Perhaps the most important was the installation of the main colonnade pergola running south-east/north-west along the northeastern wall of the main building. The ionic columns making up the walkway were made by Norman in the tradition of his earlier renovations, and wisteria plants were added soon after. Using the same moulds, Norman also built the tank stand on the northwestern side of the studio.

A second bedroom and bathroom was added to the studio, which housed Jane in 1940s and the domestic staff at various other times, and a small square window was knocked out of the front wall to compensate for the limited light provided by the skylight. The shed was also extended to allow for Rose&#x27;s second car.

Numerous changes to the garden had also eventuated by 1928. The two figures flanking the sides of the front steps were removed by Rose, as she believed them to be disproportionate to the rest of the facade. These were salvaged from the rubbish tip years later by the Lindayana collector Keith Wingrove, who repaired them and later donated them to the National Trust (NSW) when the bequest eventuated. The statues were replaced with two urns, which Rose purchased. The winged siren statue and the bench were installed in 1928 on the site of the roundhouse. It is not known when this building was constructed, though it was probably in the middle to late 1910s. The only remaining fabric is the concrete slab, upon which the bench and statue were placed.

Just before Norman and Rose left for the United States of America and England in 1930, one last addition was completed. The passageway between the ding room and the bathroom was constructed, resulting in the dismantling of the grape vine pergola, though remnants of the plants did remain. During this time there was also a bush pole and chicken wire screen planted with banana passionfruit, which ran from the corner of the laundry to the tank stand next to the studio.

After Norman and Rose left, &quot;The Camp&quot; was abandoned as the servants quarters when the Gassons, the staff of that time, moved into the house to take care of Jane and Honey Lindsay. Soon after, the building became infested with termites, until it was finally demolished around 1933. This period also spelt the end of the children&#x27;s playhouse under the remaining Moreton Bay Fig. The playhouse had been built in the mid-1920s.

Upon Norman&#x27;s and Rose&#x27;s return from overseas and Norman&#x27;s departure to 12 Bridge Street Sydney in 1934, a number of alterations came about, primarily instigated by Rose. With the intention of converting the studio to a gallery, she made some changes, starting with the bricking up of the small square window in the front, and having all of the exterior walls stuccoed. The original door was replaced with a reused historic cedar door, and the interior walls were lined with Hussein painted a bronze colour. A porch and picture rails were added, and the basin was removed to the back storeroom. This gallery idea never came to fruition, and the studio reverted to its former use upon Norman&#x27;s and Janis return in 1940.

Following Norman&#x27;s and Jane&#x27;s return from Sydney in 1940 and following Rose&#x27;s return from the United States of America in 1942, there was a further period of change for the property. In 1941, the statue of the woman bending to dry her hair was moved from its position at the front of the studio to its current location at the top of the stairs leading to the swimming pool, on the understanding that the move would be temporary until Norman could find another base. This rearrangement was to make way for Norman&#x27;s latest creation, the three-figure statue of a female nude and two satyrs. It was around 1943 that the two statues of the satyr and the sphinx were constructed and installed in their positions marking the path to the bottom of the garden and the swimming pool.

In 1946 the property was connected to the town water supply, leading to the construction of Norman&#x27;s first fountain, the seahorse. This fountain had running water before the house was connected. In that same year the wall between the dining room and the nursery was removed and the ceiling was renovated, creating the dining room as it is now. It was in this year also that drawing room was redecorated, with the painting recesses and gold wallpaper being removed, and the lounge suites recovered.

By 1949, the etching studio was no longer in use, due to the change in direction Norman had taken with his art, and so the seven-acre block and the studio were transferred to Jane&#x27;s name. She consequently designed extensions to the studio for a house and commissioned Clarrie and Mick Stratton to build it. The cottage was constructed from locally quarried sandstone, and it was completed in 1950, as well as flagged paths and terraces. Jane Lindsay lived there, on and off until about 1956 when she and her husband Bruce moved to Hunters Hill.

At this time a septic system was installed at Jane&#x27;s new house, and later at the main house. By this time the washing machine at the main house was located in the bathroom, indicating that the laundry was no longer in use.

In 1956 Rose moved to Hunters Hill with Jane and did not live at Springwood again. Late in the 1950s, when Norman was living alone; a bushfire came through and destroyed the shed complex. Soon after this, the painting studio began to leak so Norman moved into the house. From the late 1950s onwards he used the house as a virtual studio: keeping the model boats in the bedroom, using the courtyard for carpentry, cutting mounts in the sleepout and using the dining room for painting, writing and living. The spare bedroom he used for sleeping.

In 1968 Norman installed his final statue, a fountain with the figure of a reclining woman. This statue was constructed in the courtyard and lifted by a crane to its current position. By this time, Norman had decided that he wished to bequest the property to the National Trust of Australia, and consequently began making changes to the building, which continued, into 1969. These changes were the initial stages of the property&#x27;s conversion to a gallery and museum. With the help of Harry McPhee, the &quot;Sleep-out&quot; was extended to the front wall and totally enclosed, with the addition of a counter for the use of a shop. The drawing room underwent major changes with the installation of Fluorescent lights and the blocking off of the windows and the French doors. Lindsay remained living on the property until his death in 1969, aged 91. The oil painting studio has been preserved as it was at the time of his death with unfinished oils and materials.

===Acquisition by the National Trust of Australia===
The property was purchased by the National Trust in December 1970 for A$50,000. In 1994 the property was used to film the movie &quot;Sirens&quot;.

During their period of residence at Springwood, the Lindsays created a body of work of national importance. Norman Lindsay was the artist and creator: Rose was the etching technician, nurturer and wellspring of Norman&#x27;s artistic drive. Much of Norman&#x27;s art was inspired by the physical form of their Springwood property; and his imagination peopled its landscape and provided a background for his art. The Lindsay&#x27;s garden at Springwood, and their artwork, are the product of the same creative mind. The garden can be seen as a three-dimensional idealisation of the Lindsay&#x27;s two-dimensional artwork. The conjunction of the artist&#x27;s immediate environment and his artwork has a great deal to say about Lindsay&#x27;s subject matter as well as his creative process. In a way, his pictures grew out of his imagination, but also required an element of the tangible; hence the use of models photographs and research files of magazine clippings in developing a work. In a similar way, Norman Lindsay&#x27;s determined manipulation of the Springwood buildings, gardens and landscape consciously provided tangible forms, which informed his artwork, and provided imagery for them. Thus the house and garden have the rare ability to illustrate Norman Lindsay&#x27;s creative process.

The Lindsay&#x27;s Springwood property is, and was unique in Australia. The artist lived and worked there for most of his life. There are several other properties in Australia, which have connections with artists. At Hahndorf, in South Australia the house and studio of Hans Heyson has been maintained, but it has much more of a domestic sense than the Springwood property. The Arthur Boyd property at Bundanoon is now operated to include working artists. In Melbourne the home of the Reeds, at Heide near Heidelberg, includes a gallery for exhibitions and has a full-time curator. Daryl Lindsay&#x27;s house at Mulberry Hill in Victoria is a National Trust property open for public visitation.

Norman Lindsay is widely recognised within Australia and overseas, and most visitors to Springwood are familiar with his name, if not with everything he did. Perhaps the best comparison for an artist&#x27;s house museum could be made with the Rodin house and museum in Paris.

In 2015 the National Trust completed a new state-of-the-art air-conditioning system in the gallery that will ensure the nationally significant artworks are displayed in museum-standard climate-controlled conditions, reduce energy consumption and operational costs. The gallery, along with Everglades and Woodford Academy were all represented in the Blue Mountains Winter Magic street festival which attracted over 30,000 people. Currently, Norman Lindsay&#x27;s house and property is a popular tourist attraction in the Blue Mountains, not only for the art work on display but also for the beautiful gardens and bushwalk. Also on the property is Lindsay&#x27;s Cafe, attached to Norman Lindsay&#x27;s old etching studio.

== Description ==
The Norman Lindsay Gallery is a sandstone building with terra cotta tile roof and a verandah on three sides. A colonnaded pergola is located on the north eastern elevation. An enclosed courtyard on the western elevation is adjacent to a kitchen and former bathroom which are separately connected to the house by enclosed breezeways.

The grounds are an eclectic mix of Blue Mountasins hill station gardenesque and interwar domestic styles with idiosyncratic overlay of the work of the artist Norman Lindsay and members of his family in a park like setting surrounded by remnant native bushland. The garden is adorned with sculptures of nymphs, satyrs, sphinxes and female forms, fountains and urns. Formal hedges lead to particular statues and the extensive lawns are dotted with exotic specimen trees, mainly conifers and coral trees.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 12 October 2000, The house, studios, grounds and bush walk which comprise what we know as the Norman Lindsay Gallery Museum, etching studio and grounds, are intrinsically connected to Norman and Rose Lindsay, the Lindsay family generally, and the society of visitors and artists which the place attracted. The Norman Lindsay house and grounds occupied an important place in the artistic, literary and moral history of early to mid-20th century Australia: and as such the place is significant within a national context. The place provides potential to reveal the creative achievement of Norman and Rose Lindsay, and their family in integrating building, landscape and artwork. The landscaping of the grounds with fifteen fountains and statues, and the artworks and other contents of the house demonstrates the family artistic excellence.

Norman Lindsay Gallery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The house, studios, grounds and bush walk which comprise what we know as the Norman Lindsay Gallery Museum, etching studio and grounds, are intrinsically connected to Norman and Rose Lindsay, the Lindsay family generally, and the society of visitors and artists which the place attracted. The Norman Lindsay Gallery Museum and grounds are historically significant because of the influence and activities of the National Trust of Australia (NSW), who have owned and managed the property since 1969–1970. The trust&#x27;s custodianship and management of the Springwood property over the last thirty years has been informed by an evolving understanding of the property: and of the most appropriate interpretation of the place for the visiting public.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The landscape and statues of the Norman Lindsay property is highly significant because it represents an eclectic mix of Blue Mountains hill station gardenesque and interwar domestic styles with idiosyncratic overlays of the work of the artist Norman Lindsay and members of his family in a park-like setting surrounded by remnant native Bushland. The garden is adorned with sculptures of nymphs, satyrs, sphinxes and female forms, fountains and urns. Formal hedges lead to particular statues and the extensive lawns are dotted with exotic specimen trees, mainly conifers and coral trees.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The Norman Lindsay house and grounds occupied an important place in the artistic, literary and moral history of early to mid-20th century Australia: and as such the place is significant within a national context. This significance is exemplified by the continuing visitation by the public to this place.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The place provides potential to reveal the creative achievement of Norman and Rose Lindsay, and their family in integrating building, landscape and artwork. The landscaping of the grounds with fifteen fountains and statues, and the artworks and other contents of the house demonstrates the family artistic excellence.

<text>Minnedosa was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba from 1881 to 2011. It was created in 1881 with the expansion of the province&#x27;s western boundary. From 1886 to 1888, it was divided into two ridings, Minnedosa East and Minnedosa West.

Minnedosa was located in the southwestern region of Manitoba. It was bordered by Russell to the north, Ste. Rose to the east, Turtle Mountain to the east and south, and Arthur-Virden to the south and west. The constituency also surrounded the City of Brandon, which is divided into the ridings of Brandon East and Brandon West.

Minnedosa itself was the largest community in the constituency. Other communities in riding the included Souris, Rivers, Rapid City, Shilo, Basswood, Wawanesa, and Erickson.

Minnedosa&#x27;s population in 1996 was 18,694. In 1999, the average family income was $46,627, and the unemployment rate was 3.50%. Agriculture accounted for 22% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by government services at 12% and health and social services at 12%. Six per cent of the population was of German background, and 15% were over 65 years of age.

Minnedosa was held by the Progressive Conservative Party for several decades, but the New Democratic Party made efforts to win the seat in the riding&#x27;s last years. In the provincial election of 2003, the Conservative Party retained the seat by only 12 votes, but in the 2007 Election the Progressive Conservative incumbent Leanne Rowat won with 52.83% and the NDP candidate won 38.53% of the vote.

As a result of the 2008 Electoral Redistibution, for the 2011 Election, the constituency was dissolved. Most of the riding, including the city of Minnedosa, became part of the new riding of Riding Mountain. Smaller portions were transferred to the new ridings of Spruce Woods and Arthur-Virden.

<text>&quot;Ich will&quot; (German for &quot;I Want&quot;) is a song by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein from their third studio album &quot;Mutter&quot;. It was originally released in Germany in 2001. The German single contains a live cover of the Ramones song &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; sung by Rammstein keyboardist Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz. It is the walk-on song for Martin Schindler for the European Tour 

==Music video==
The music video of &quot;Ich will&quot; features the band members staging a bank robbery, making it seem as realistic as possible. The video shows both the robbery and its aftermath, and moves between these two scenes.

During the robbery scenes, the band is shown entering a bank wearing stockings over their heads, except for Flake, who has a very large and elaborate bomb strapped to his chest. They quickly remove their masks and head for the front desk. A bank employee reaches for the panic button, but she is seen by Richard, who presses her hand against the button, intentionally triggering the alarm. 

The woman faints, and Richard dances with her unconscious body until Ollie confirms that the police and media have arrived. The group continues to terrorize the hostages and vandalize the bank, while also fantasizing about the media storm when they exit. In another room, Till is giving a live interview to the press, who appear to be slain in the next scene, though the broadcast continues. 

As the band, excluding Flake, exit the bank unarmed, they are swarmed by members of the &quot;Spezialeinsatzkommando&quot; instead of the media as anticipated. Despite this, the band seems to revel in the attention they are getting, and shortly after the timer on Flake&#x27;s bomb reaches zero. The video quickly flicks through a series of short clips from some of Rammstein&#x27;s other music videos, then comes to an end.

During the aftermath scenes, the band, Flake excluded, emerges from a police bus wearing shackles and prison attire. They are escorted by guards down a red carpet surrounded by a large cheering crowd and many cameras, toward a podium where they receive a &quot;Goldene Kamera&quot; (Golden Camera) award, a German version of the Emmy award. Behind the podium is the main entrance of the bank they destroyed earlier, with a large sepia picture of Flake over the door. Most of the &quot;aftermath&quot; is shown at the beginning of the clip, although it is revisited later.

In an interview, Rammstein described the music video of &quot;Ich will&quot; as being a demonstration of the media&#x27;s obsession with a good story, as well as an illustration of the immortality that can be achieved by those who commit wrongs. The video was filmed in Berlin in the former State Council of the German Democratic Republic building (&quot;Staatsratsgebäude&quot;) which now houses the European School of Management and Technology.

==Live story==
Along with &quot;Nebel&quot;, &quot;Ich will&quot; was the only song from &quot;Mutter&quot; that was not played live in its demo form in the concert for members of the Fan Area in April 2000. Instead, it debuted on 1 May 2001, in another concert for members of the Fan Area. When played live, explosions are part of the performance, and it usually closes the show during festivals. It has been played paired with &quot;Sonne&quot; during the encores in every Rammstein concert up until Made in Germany 1995–2011 (tour), where &quot;Sonne&quot; opened the show while &quot;Ich will&quot; maintained its position in the encore.
