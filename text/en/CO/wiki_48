<text>Sol Hurok (also Solomon Israilevich Hurok; born Solomon Izrailevich Gurkov, Russian Соломон Израилевич Гурков; April 9, 1888March 5, 1974) was a 20th-century American impresario.

==Early life==
Hurok was born in Pogar, Chernigov Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Bryansk Oblast, Russia) in 1888. His father, Israel Hurok, was a hardware merchant. At age 17, he was sent to Kharkiv to learn the trade. Shortly thereafter, in 1906, he immigrated to the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1914.

==Career==
During Hurok&#x27;s long career, S. Hurok Presents managed many performing artists, including Jules Bledsoe, Marian Anderson, Irina Arkhipova, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Grace Bumbry, Feodor Chaliapin, Nestor Mesta Chayres, Van Cliburn, Victoria de los Ángeles, Manuela del Río, Isadora Duncan, Katherine Dunham, Michel Fokine, Margot Fonteyn, Emil Gilels, Alexander Glazunov, Horacio Gutiérrez, Daniel Heifetz, Jerome Hines, Isa Kremer, Moura Lympany, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, David Oistrakh, Anna Pavlova, Jan Peerce, Sviatoslav Richter, Mstislav Rostropovich, Arthur Rubinstein, Andrés Segovia, Isaac Stern, Galina Vishnevskaya, Regine, Ralph Votapek, Efrem Zimbalist, Mariemma and many others.

In the early 1920s, opportunities for Black singers, especially Black male singers, were nearly non-existent on the concert or operatic stage. Most of the few who found any success did so by traveling to Europe to establish a professional career. Jules Bledsoe was an exception: he was able to sign with Hurok. With Hurok&#x27;s sponsorship, Bledsoe made his professional singing debut in New York&#x27;s Aeolian Hall on Easter Sunday, April 20, 1924.

In 1935, Rubinstein introduced Hurok to singer Marian Anderson, who retained Hurok as her manager for the rest of her career. A few years later, with Walter White of the NAACP and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Hurok was instrumental in persuading U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes to arrange Anderson&#x27;s Easter Sunday open-air concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on April 9, 1939.

Beginning in the late 1930s Hurok managed Colonel W. de Basil&#x27;s Original Ballet Russe, as well as its offshoot rival company, Sergei J. Denham&#x27;s The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. They often performed near each other, and Hurok hoped to reunite the companies, but ultimately was unsuccessful.

In 1959, after 35 years of effort, Sol Hurok brought the Soviet Bolshoi Ballet to the United States for an eight-week performance tour. In 1961, he brought the Kirov Academy of Ballet and the Igor Moiseyev Ballet Company to the U.S. In 1962, he again brought the Bolshoi to the U.S. for a tour at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The First Moog Quartet, the first to perform electronic music in Carnegie Hall, was formed in 1970 in response to Hurok&#x27;s request to hear the Moog synthesizer in a live concert.

In honor of Hurok&#x27;s influence on American music, on December 4, 1971, he was awarded the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. Beginning in 1964, this award was &quot;established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year that has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.&quot;

In 1972, a bomb planted in Hurok&#x27;s Manhattan office exploded, killing employee Iris Kones and injuring several others, including Hurok. While many people believe the bombing had been arranged by the Jewish Defense League, a far-right terrorist organization which opposed the U.S. tours of artists from the Soviet Union, no one was ever convicted of the crime.

==Death==
In 1974, en route to a meeting with David Rockefeller to discuss a Rudolf Nureyev project, Hurok died of a heart attack. More than two thousand people nearly filled Carnegie Hall for his funeral, where Marian Anderson delivered the final eulogy.

Overall, he played 19 games for the Lions including 7 tests and scored one try. He was the second England player to reach 50 caps, after Rory Underwood, and was inducted onto the Twickenham &quot;Wall of Fame&quot; in November 2005.

Winterbottom played club rugby for Headingley, Harlequins and also for Hawkes Bay in New Zealand and Transvaal in South Africa

==After rugby==
Since his playing career ended, Winterbottom carved out a career in finance. He worked as a Corporate bond broker for Tullett &amp; Tokyo Ltd and BGC Partners alongside Ben Clarke, but left BGC in 2008 to join interdealer broker Creditex.
Peter is currently Director Rugby at Esher Rugby Football Club.

==Personal life==
Winterbottom is the uncle of Swiss-born James Leuzinger, who represented Great Britain at the 2006 Winter Olympics.

<doc id="1285393" wikidata="Q86502" url="?curid=1285393" title="Rudolf Bing">
<text>Sir Rudolf Bing, KBE (January 9, 1902 – September 2, 1997) was an Austrian-born British opera impresario who worked in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, including as General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1950 to 1972. He was naturalized as a British subject in 1946 and was knighted in 1971, although he spent decades living in the United States, where he died.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Born Rudolf Franz Joseph Bing in Vienna, Austria-Hungary to a well-to-do Jewish family (his father was an industrialist). Bing was an apprentice to a bookseller at the prestigious Viennese shop of Gilhofer &amp; Ranschburg before moving on to Hugo Heller, who also ran a theatrical and concert agency. He then studied music and art history at the University of Vienna. In 1927, he went to Berlin, Germany, and subsequently served as general manager of opera houses in that city and in Darmstadt.

While in Berlin he married a Russian ballerina, Nina Schelemskaya-Schlesnaya. In 1934, with the rise of Nazi Germany, the Bings moved to the United Kingdom, where, in 1946, he became a naturalised British subject. There, together with Fritz Busch and Carl Ebert, he helped to found the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. After the war in 1947, he co-founded and was the first director of the Edinburgh International Festival in Scotland.

===Metropolitan Opera===
In 1949, he moved to the United States, and became General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera the following year, a post he held for 22 years. During the 1960s, he supervised the move of the old Metropolitan on Broadway and 39th Street, to its new quarters in Lincoln Center and presided over one of the most prominent eras of the Met. It was summed up in 1990 by James Oestreich in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as follows:
&quot;Wielding his powerful position at the Metropolitan Opera with intense personal charisma over two decades, Sir Rudolf Bing ruled much of the operatic universe in autocratic fashion, nurturing young artists and cutting superstars down to size with equal enthusiasm. He oversaw the abandonment in 1966 of the stately but somewhat dilapidated old Metropolitan Opera House [which he then had razed] and the construction of a grand monument to his regime, the building the company now occupies, which dominates Lincoln Center. His conservative musical and dramatic bent, preference for Italian opera and concern for theatrical values yielded an identifiable artistic legacy.&quot;

During Bing&#x27;s tenure the Met&#x27;s artist roster became integrated for the first time. Marian Anderson became the first African American to sing a leading role in 1955. She was soon followed by Robert McFerrin, Gloria Davy, Mattiwilda Dobbs, Leontyne Price, George Shirley, Grace Bumbry, Shirley Verrett, Reri Grist, and many others. He was noted for his preference for European singers and an apparent lack of interest in some leading American performers. Beverly Sills had to wait until after Bing&#x27;s retirement to make her Met debut in 1975, although Bing later said that not engaging Sills earlier was a mistake. He fostered the careers of many American artists. Roberta Peters, Leontyne Price, Anna Moffo, Sherrill Milnes, and Jess Thomas are just a few that flourished during his time.

Bing is also remembered for his stormy relationship with the era&#x27;s most famous soprano, Maria Callas. After hiring her for the Met with a debut as &quot;Norma&quot; on opening night in 1956, he famously canceled her contract in 1958 when they could not come to terms regarding the roles she would sing. Bing invited Callas to return to the Met for two performances of &quot;Tosca&quot; in 1965, the year that turned out to be her final season in opera.

After leaving the Met, Bing wrote two books of memoirs, &quot;5000 Nights at the Opera&quot; (1972) and &quot;A Knight at the Opera&quot; (1981).

===Personal life===
While living in Berlin, Bing married the Russian ballerina Nina Schelemskaya-Schlesnaya in 1928. They remained together until her death in 1983. They had no children.
In January 1987, when Bing was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, he married Carroll Douglass, a 45-year-old woman with a history of mental illness, who then took him, in violation of a court order, on a 10-month-long excursion to Florida, then Anguilla, and eventually to Italy and the United Kingdom, where she had sought to buy Rolls-Royce automobiles and a helicopter to give to the Pope, for whom she had a fixation. The couple were found living in a homeless shelter in Leeds, England, before being coaxed to return to New York by Sir Rudolf&#x27;s lawyers. By 1989, a lawyer for Bing reported that his estate had been reduced during the marriage from $900,000 to less than $200,000, much of it spent on bodyguards hired to keep Douglass from spiriting him out of New York. 

For this reason, and owing to Bing&#x27;s mental impairment, a New York state court in September declared him incompetent to enter into a marriage contract and annulled the union. Douglass was a patient in the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital at the time and received no settlement except $25,000 to cover hospital expenses.

===Final years===
In May 1989, Roberta Peters and Teresa Stratas arranged for Bing to be admitted to the Hebrew Home for the Aged in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, New York, where he resided until his death. Bing died from respiratory failure as a complication of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on September 2, 1997, aged 95, at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Yonkers, New York.
He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

==Honors==
In New Year Honours List of 1956, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Bing a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for &quot;services to music.&quot; In 1971, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for &quot;services to Anglo-American relations,&quot; becoming Sir Rudolf Bing. Throughout his years in America, Bing had remained a British citizen.
In 1973, Bing received the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold for Services to the Republic of Austria.

<text>Shek Tong Tsui ( or ) or Belcher Point is an area in Sai Wan on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong. Administratively, it belongs to the Central and Western District.

This area is bounded to the east by Ka On Street, north by the Victoria Harbour, south by Pok Fu Lam Road and Third Street, and west by the intersection of Queen&#x27;s Road West and Belcher&#x27;s Street. To the east lies Sai Ying Pun and to the west is Kennedy Town. To the south are the slopes of Victoria Peak, Lung Fu Shan and High West. While the boundaries are not de jure drawn, they are nevertheless de facto defined by Collinson Street to the west and 

==History==
The name Shek Tong Tsui derives from an old stone pond nearby, or &quot;Shek Tong&quot; () in Cantonese. It was located around modern-day Hill Road and The Belcher&#x27;s, and was used by the Hakka people since the 17th century. 
The area was first settled in 1880 by granite miners. In the early 1900s, Hong Kong Island&#x27;s brothels were moved from Possession Point in Sheung Wan to this area under orders from the Hong Kong Governor Matthew Nathan. The place thus flourished as a red light district and came to its golden period. During this period, affluent Chinese in Hong Kong came to Shek Tong Tsui for entertainment, and numerous Cantonese opera theatres and Cantonese restaurants were founded in the area. It was known locally in the Cantonese phrase &quot;tong sai fung yuet&quot; (), which literally means &quot;good times west of the pond&quot;. Brothels in this area inspired numerous novels and Hong Kong films, most notably &quot;Rouge &quot;(1987), starring Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung.

This golden period lasted until the banning of prostitution by the Hong Kong Government in 1935. However, during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese military government relocated all Chinese brothels to the area, which they renamed Kuramae (). Again the area boomed, with about 500 brothels, which served only Japanese.

After the Japanese defeat, the area reverted to its Chinese name, like the rest of Hong Kong. The prostitution ban returned, and Shek Tong Tsui began urbanisation for decades.

==Constituency==

A constituency in the Central and Western District is called Shek Tong Tsui, extending as far as Water Street and into Sai Ying Pun. With a population of 17,170 (2011), the constituency returns one representative to the district council. Chan Choi-hi was elected in 1999, and 2003. The major housing developments in the ward are: Chong Yip Centre, Dragonfair Garden, Elegant Garden, Kong Chian Tower, Kwan Yick Building Phase I, and Wah Ming Centre.

The Belcher constituency also covers part of Shek Tong Tsui, south of Queen&#x27;s Road West. Yeung Sui Yin was elected in 2003. Wong Chit Man was elected in 1999. The Water Street constituency also lies within Shek Tong Tsui.

==Transport==
The tram terminus near Whitty Street is one of the termini of Hong Kong Tramways. Bus and minibus services are also available along the main streets. HKU station of the West Island line, an extension of the existing MTR Island line, serves this area.

The major roads in Shek Tong Tsui are the western ends of Des Voeux Road West and Queen&#x27;s Road West, Hill Road and part of Pok Fu Lam Road. Connaught Road West is the major access road. Hill Road is a &quot;double decker&quot; road taking traffic downhill from Pok Fu Lam Road to Connaught Road.

There are also a number of smaller terrace roads, including Yat Fu Lane, Woo Hop Street, Clarence Terrace, Po Tuck Street and South Lane.

==Education==
Shek Tong Tsui is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 11. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and the following government schools: Bonham Road Government Primary School and (李陞小學).

<doc id="1285416" wikidata="Q9290860" url="?curid=1285416" title="Common bile duct stone">
<text>Common bile duct stone, also known as choledocholithiasis, is the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct (CBD) (thus &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;). This condition can cause jaundice and liver cell damage. Treatments include choledocholithotomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

==Signs and symptoms==
Murphy&#x27;s sign is commonly negative on physical examination in choledocholithiasis, helping to distinguish it from cholecystitis. Jaundice of the skin or eyes is an important physical finding in biliary obstruction. Jaundice and/or clay-colored stool may raise suspicion of choledocholithiasis or even gallstone pancreatitis. If the above symptoms coincide with fever and chills, the diagnosis of ascending cholangitis may also be considered.

More than 70% of people with gallstones are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally during ultrasound. Studies have shown that 10% of those with gallstones will develop symptoms within 5 years of diagnosis, and 20% within 20 years.

==Causes==
While stones can frequently pass through the common bile duct into the duodenum, some stones may be too large to pass through the common bile duct and may cause an obstruction. One risk factor for this is duodenal diverticulum.

==Pathophysiology==
This obstruction may lead to jaundice, elevation in alkaline phosphatase, increase in conjugated bilirubin in the blood and increase in cholesterol in the blood. It can also cause acute pancreatitis and ascending cholangitis.

==Diagnosis==
Choledocholithiasis (stones in common bile duct) is one of the complications of cholelithiasis (gallstones), so the initial step is to confirm the diagnosis of cholelithiasis. Patients with cholelithiasis typically present with pain in the right-upper quadrant of the abdomen with the associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting, especially after a fatty meal. The physician can confirm the diagnosis of cholelithiasis with an abdominal ultrasound that shows the ultrasonic shadows of the stones in the gallbladder.

Although unusual, it is possible to have a common bile duct stone despite prior cholecystectomy. One study found that in patients diagnosed with choledocholithiasis, 28% had undergone prior cholecystectomy. Such stones are thought to be the result of stones missed at the time of the cholecystectomy, as opposed to the formation of new stones.

The diagnosis of choledocholithiasis is suggested when the liver function blood test shows an elevation in bilirubin and serum transaminases. Other indicators include raised indicators of ampulla of vater (pancreatic duct obstruction) such as lipases and amylases. In prolonged cases the international normalized ratio (INR) may change due to a decrease in vitamin K absorption. (It is the decreased bile flow which reduces fat breakdown and therefore absorption of fat soluble vitamins).
The diagnosis is confirmed with either a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or an intraoperative cholangiogram. If the patient must have the gallbladder removed for gallstones, the surgeon may choose to proceed with the surgery, and obtain a cholangiogram during the surgery. If the cholangiogram shows a stone in the bile duct, the surgeon may attempt to treat the problem by flushing the stone into the intestine or retrieve the stone back through the cystic duct.

On a different pathway, the physician may choose to proceed with ERCP before surgery. The benefit of ERCP is that it can be utilized not just to diagnose, but also to treat the problem. During ERCP the endoscopist may surgically widen the opening into the bile duct and remove the stone through that opening. ERCP, however, is an invasive procedure and has its own potential complications. Thus, if the suspicion is low, the physician may choose to confirm the diagnosis with MRCP, a non-invasive imaging technique, before proceeding with ERCP or surgery.
==Treatment==
Treatment is removal of the gallstone from the bile duct using ERCP or an intraoperative cholangiogram. In these procedures, a thin tube is introduced into the common bile duct to perform a cholangiogram. If stones are identified, the surgeon inserts a tube with an inflatable balloon to widen the duct, and the stones are usually removed using either a balloon or tiny basket. A laser can be used to split big stones and make it easier to solve it using laparoscopy.

If the either of these procedures is unsuccessful, the stone can be removed during surgery through an incision into the bile duct at the location of the stone (called choledocholithotomy). This procedure may be used if the stone is very large or if the duct anatomy is complex.

Typically, the gallbladder is then removed, an operation called cholecystectomy, to prevent a future occurrence of common bile duct obstruction or other complications.

<text>Youngsan University is a private university in southeastern South Korea. It operates a main campus in Yangsan City, South Gyeongsang province, a branch campus in nearby Busan, and an &quot;auxiliary learning center&quot; in Seoul. Youngsan offers undergraduate degrees in various practical fields, including international studies, law, Asian business, and information engineering. It also offers graduate degrees in legal affairs, hotel tourism management, information technology, real estate, and teaching English as a foreign language.

==History==
The Sungsim School Foundation (est. 1973)) received permission to open Youngsan University in 1996, and did so shortly thereafter, on March 10, 1997. The school was thus founded as a university, which is unusual; most South Korean universities began their existence as technical schools or colleges. The first president was Chun-koo Jeong. The first international sisterhood relationship was established later in the same year, with the International University of Russia. The maximum enrollment at that time was 940. Graduate schools were established in 1999.

<text>Youngnam Theological University and Seminary, also YTUS, is located in Gyeongsan City, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea, in an area inhabited by numerous other institutions of higher learning. It is officially a university, and is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church of Korea.

==History==
The Bible school which would become YTUS was founded by James E. Adams, an American missionary, in 1913. After the end of the Korean War, a formal seminary was established on April 12, 1954. At that time it was called &quot;Daegu Presbyterian Seminary&quot; and was located in Daegu. The name changed to Youngnam Seminary in 1970, and the campus changed to its present location in 1987. In the same year, the seminary was accredited as a four-year college by the South Korean Ministry of Education. The school was reorganized as a university, and adopted its current lengthy name, in 1994. Two years later, the graduate school was established.

<doc id="1285425" wikidata="Q7880069" url="?curid=1285425" title="Ulsterbus">
<text>Ulsterbus is a public transport operator in Northern Ireland and operates bus services outside Belfast. It is part of Translink, the brand name for the subsidiary operating companies of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, which also includes Northern Ireland Railways and Metro Belfast.

==History==

Ulsterbus was founded in 1967 with the creation of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, replacing the former Ulster Transport Authority. The founding of Ulsterbus coincided with the beginnings of The Troubles, a conflict which intensified throughout the 1970s and 1980s and often saw Ulsterbus buses and employees caught in the crossfire. Drivers would often face hijackings, assaults and robberies while operating Ulsterbus services, their buses being turned into burning barricades or occasionally being bombed. Four Ulsterbus employees were killed in the 1972 Bloody Friday bombings when an IRA bomb exploded at the Oxford Street bus station. In total, 17 employees from both Ulsterbus and Citybus were killed during The Troubles, with 1,484 buses in total being maliciously destroyed from 1964 to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

Werner Heubeck was the first managing director of both Ulsterbus and Citybus, managing both companies throughout The Troubles from his appointment in 1965 until his retirement in 1988. A former Luftwaffe conscript, Heubeck became known for carrying bombs off buses and for making Northern Ireland&#x27;s buses profitable and running to schedule despite the security situation, and received both an OBE in 1977 and a CBE on his retirement in 1988.

The Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company was rebranded to Translink in 1996. Ulsterbus and Citybus, as well as Northern Ireland&#x27;s rail services, were integrated into Translink and were subsequently rebranded. Translink have built and refurbished a number of bus stations served by Ulsterbus and have invested in a fully low-floor bus fleet, as well as introducing brands such as the Foyle Metro.

==Services==

Ulsterbus is responsible for most of the province-wide bus services in Northern Ireland. It operates 1,100 buses and twenty-two bus stations, several of which, such as those at Belfast Grand Central and Bangor, form integrated transport interchanges with Northern Ireland Railways stations.

Ulsterbus, as part of Translink, is charged with transporting over 55,000 children per day across Northern Ireland to school. Every July and August, around 250 vehicles are usually de-taxed. This is because not as many are needed for service due to schools finishing for summer holidays.

===Goldliner===

Goldliner is the name given to the inter-city express bus services operated by Ulsterbus. Originally launched as the &#x27;Northern Ireland Express&#x27; in the 1970s, these services were rebranded to &#x27;Goldline&#x27; in 1990, with the Belfast-Derry express service relaunched as the &#x27;Maiden City Flyer&#x27; with eight new coaches in 1991. This service has seen major expansion over the years: Belfast-Derry 212 service went from a thrice daily service in 1990 to half-hourly frequency, and many services have been expanded and introduced. In 2021, these services were rebranded again to &#x27;Goldliner&#x27; in line with the wider rebranding of Translink.

Goldliner services are primarily operated from Belfast to major destinations in Northern Ireland, as well as &#x27;Xpress&#x27; branded cross-border Goldline Express Services X1 (previously service 200) to Dublin (via Dublin Airport). This service was worked jointly with Bus Éireann&#x27;s service X1 (previously service 001) until December 2020, after which Bus Éireann withdrew their X1. There is also a X2 operating express between Belfast and Dublin Airport without any intermediate stops between them.

There are also a number of cross-channel (North Channel) services to Britain, operated in partnership with National Express under the Eurolines banner.

=== Foyle Metro ===

For many years, Derry&#x27;s internal bus network was operated as Ulsterbus&#x27;s Derry City Services. The network was relaunched as Ulsterbus Foyle on 4 September 2006 following a review and expansion of the city&#x27;s bus routes and replacement of many of the city&#x27;s older buses.

Ulsterbus Foyle was later rebranded as Foyle Metro on 1 September 2017, with buses branded in a deep red livery. The rebranded service, representing an investment of over £3 million, included 19 brand new buses delivereed and many others refurbished to operates across 14 quality bus corridors with new timetables.

In 2022, £30 million of funding from the Department for Infrastructure was acquired for the purchase of 38 battery electric buses, as well as charging equipment to be installed at the Foyle Metro&#x27;s Pennyburn garage. The buses, ten being Wright StreetDeck Electroliner double-decks and 28 being Wright GB Kite Electroliner single-decks, were delivered in May 2023, with the fleet rolled out onto city services to replace existing diesel buses from August onwards, enabling the Foyle Metro fleet to be completely zero-emission.

===Ulsterbus Tours===
Ulsterbus previously operated a holiday coaching arm named &#x27;Ulsterbus Tours&#x27;, operating &quot;day tours&quot; to other parts of Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and across the Irish Sea to Great Britain, mainly for shopping and visits to tourist attractions. Coaches could also be hired for sporting events such as Old Firm derbies and racing events such as the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Ulsterbus Tours was closed in September 2020 due to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Translink.

===Urby===

The Ulsterbus Urby service is an upgraded bus service offering USB charging, faster journeys, WiFi and leather seating, initially launched with 28 new Wright double decker buses in June 2018 to operate in Ballyclare, Bangor, Newtownards and Dromore. In September 2019, routes serving Ballygowan, Comber and Moneyreagh were upgraded to Urby routes with an investment of seven new buses.

==Incidents==
In December 2015, a single-decker bus crashed into Strangford Lough after colliding with a wall on the Portaferry Road near Newtownards. No passengers were on board at the time and the driver of the bus sustained only minor injuries. The bus was recovered and put back onto land a few hours later.

Two Ulsterbus Goldline coaches have suffered engine fires while in service; a coach bound for Belfast caught fire outside of Lurgan, County Armagh in November 2016, while another caught fire on the M2 in County Antrim in July 2021, which the company states was caused by &quot;accidental ignition&quot;.

An Urby bus was hijacked and set alight by &quot;masked men&quot; on the morning of 1 November 2021 in Newtownards. The bus had recently entered service in the Bowtown estate when hijackers held the driver at gunpoint and &quot;muttered something about the (Northern Ireland) protocol&quot; before setting the bus alight. No passengers were on board at the time, but the bus was totally destroyed and the driver left &quot;badly shaken&quot;. The attack was widely condemned by members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and all buses to the town were briefly suspended.

A double-decker Urby school bus carrying 43 pupils from Strangford College overturned in a field near Carrowdore on 7 October 2024 after colliding with a post. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service declared a major incident at the scene due to the number of ambulances required to attend, with the incident resulting in four pupils being taken to hospital and the rest onboard being released with minor injuries.

==Fleet==

As of October 2021, the Ulsterbus fleet consists of nearly 1,100 buses and coaches, with buses predominantly bodied by Wrightbus of Ballymena.

Prior to the advent of low-floor buses, the Ulsterbus fleet mainly consisted of Alexander-bodied Bristol REs, Leyland Leopards, Leyland Tigers and Volvo B10Ms. Many of these would be hijacked and maliciously destroyed throughout The Troubles, and as such, second-hand Bristol, Leyland and AEC buses were regularly purchased from British operators.

The last Leyland Tiger of a fleet of over 600 was handed over to the company in September 1993, with Ulsterbus moving over to the Volvo B10M following the closure of Leyland Bus. Most high-floor Ulsterbus buses were withdrawn by the mid-2000s; the last Leyland Leopards were finally withdrawn in 2006, with 681 being built for Ulsterbus and 228 of these being maliciously destroyed.

Following an order for 40 Leyland Atlanteans in 1971, no further double decker buses were ordered, as they were seen as expensive to run and not offering good value for money at the time. In 2001, however, double decker buses were reintroduced to Northern Ireland through the purchase of 20 low-floor Volvo B7TLs with Alexander ALX400 bodywork for both Ulsterbus and Citybus.

<text>The BMW M21 is a straight-six diesel engine developed by the German engine manufacturer BMW. It has swirl chamber injection and is based on the M20 petrol engine and was produced for BMW by the Upper Austrian Steyr engine plant from 1983 to 1991. It was succeeded by the M51.

== Background ==

In the 1970s BMW decided to develop an engine, which would both be powerful and have a good fuel economy. This was caused by the oil crisis in 1973. In 1975 a group of BMW engineers started working on the M78/M105 diesel engine project, using the M20 petrol engine as the basis. By the time the engine entered production, the code name was changed to M21. The Steyr engine plant was planned from the beginning to be the sole manufacturer of the new diesel engine. It started as a joint venture with Steyr-Daimler Puch in 1978, but in February 1982 BMW took over the reins. The first engines built there (in early 1982) were six-cylinder petrol units. Beginning in 1983, Ford was planning to buy 190,000 BMW turbodiesels over a period of several years. With the American diesel market imploding in the early 1980s, Ford only built a small number of Lincolns thus equipped and only for two model years. 

In 1983 at the IAA, the first passenger car was shown to the public which made use of the M21. It was the E28 524td, which has a top speed of and reaches in 12.9 s. This 5-series BMW was the fastest series production diesel car in the world in 1983. It has a fuel economy of .

== Technical description ==

As per the M20, the M21 is water-cooled, has a cast iron block and a SOHC valvetrain. The camshaft is driven by a belt, each cylinder has one inlet and one outlet valve. Compared to the M20, the M21 has reinforced connecting rods, cylinder heads, pistons, valves and a reinforced crankshaft with seven bearings.

For faster engine startup the M21 has a glowplug system called &quot;instant start&quot;, which reduces the time to reach starting temperature compared to similar diesel engines. The fuel is injected into swirl chambers.

A Garrett turbocharger is used (without an intercooler). Initially, the M21 was only available as a turbocharged engine. In 1985, BMW introduced a naturally aspirated version of the M21, which was popular in countries with a high motor vehicle tax.

Initially, the fuel pump was controlled mechanically. From 1987 Bosch&#x27;s electronically controlled fuel pump was used (EDC, called DDE, Digital Diesel Electronics by BMW), which increased the torque output by . The updated engine has a smaller turbocharger, which improves response. The naturally aspirated engine was fitted with ESC from 1989.

== Models ==
Applications:
* 1983 - 1988 E28 524td
* 1985 - 1988 E28 524d (naturally aspirated)
* 1985 - 1993 E30 324d (naturally aspirated)
* 1985 - 1993 E30 324td
* 1988 - 1991 E34 524td
* 1984 - 1985 Continental Mark VII
* 1984 - 1985 Lincoln Continental
* 1986 - 1987 Vixen 21 TD and Vixen 21 XC
* 1989 - 1991 Bertone Freeclimber
* 1992 UMM Alter II (four examples built)

<doc id="1285457" wikidata="Q1795701" url="?curid=1285457" title="Maritime Mobile Service Identity">
<text>A Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) is effectively a maritime object&#x27;s international &quot;maritime telephone number&quot;, a temporarily assigned UID issued by that object&#x27;s current flag state (unlike an IMO number, which is a permanent global UID).

An MMSI comprises a series of nine digits, consisting of three Maritime Identification Digits (country-codes), concatenated with a specific identifier. Whenever an object is re-flagged, a new MMSI must be assigned.

A &quot;maritime object&quot; could be anything that requests an MMSI identifier.—e.g., a vessel, fixed offshore installation, mobile unit, maritime aircraft, coast station, etc. 
Communications may be routed to &quot;individual objects&quot;, or to &quot;groups of objects&quot;. A group call to objects can be based on an object&#x27;s locale, owner/operator/fleet, type, etc. or combinations thereof.

MMSI are formed in such a way that the identity or part thereof can be used by telephone and telex subscribers connected to the general telecommunications network to call any of these objects automatically. Communications are sent in digital form over a radio frequency channel.

==Types==
As of 2024, there are six kinds of maritime mobile service identities:
* Ship station identities
* Group ship station identities
* Coast station identities
* Group coast station identities
* SAR aircraft
* Navigational aids and craft associated with a parent ship

==Maritime identification digits (MID)==

An MID consists of three digits, always starting with a number from 2 to 7 (assigned regionally). A second MID can be assigned once the first or subsequently allocated MID is more than 80% exhausted, and the rate of assignments is such that 90% exhaustion is foreseen. A listing of MIDs assigned to each country can be found in Table 1 of ITU Radio Regulations Appendix 43.

==The first digit of an MMSI==
The initial digits of an MMSI categorize the identity, as defined in by Recommendation M.585. The meaning of the first digit is:

* 0 Ship group, coast station, or group of coast stations 
* 1 For use by SAR aircraft (111MIDaxx)
* 2-7 MMSI&#x27;s used by individual ships, beginning with an MID:
** 2 Europe (e.g., Italy has MID 247; Denmark has MIDs 219 &quot;and&quot; 220)
** 3 North and Central America and Caribbean (e.g., Canada, 316; Greenland, 331; Panama, 351 through 357, plus 370 through 373; United States, 303(Alaska), 338(domestic), plus 366 through 369)
** 4 Asia (not the southeast) (e.g., PRC, 412, 413, and 414; Maldives, 455; Japan, 431)
** 5 Oceania (Australia, 503; New Zealand, 512), and Southeast Asia (Philippines, 548; Indonesia, 525)
** 6 Africa (Eritrea, 625)
** 7 South America (Peru, 760)
* 8 Handheld VHF transceiver with DSC and GNSS
* 9 Devices using a free-form number identity:
** Search and Rescue Transponders (970yyzzzz)
** Man overboard DSC and/or AIS devices (972yyzzzz)
** 406 MHz EPIRBs fitted with an AIS transmitter (974yyzzzz)
** craft associated with a parent ship (98MIDxxxx)
** navigational aids (AtoNs; 99MIDaxxx)

;Notes
==Station Identity Formats==

===Ship station identities===
The 9-digit code constituting a ship station identity is formed as follows:

:MIDxxxxxx

where MID represent the Maritime Identification Digits and X is any figure from 0 to 9. If the ship is fitted with an Inmarsat B, C or M ship earth station, or it is expected to be so equipped in the foreseeable future, then the identity should have three trailing zeros:

:MIDxxx000

If the ship is fitted with an Inmarsat C ship earth station, or it is expected to be so equipped in the foreseeable future, then the identity could have one trailing zero:

:MIDxxxxx0

If the ship is fitted with an Inmarsat A ship earth station, or has satellite equipment other than Inmarsat, then the identity needs no trailing zero.

===Group ship station call identities===
Group ship station call identities for calling simultaneously more than one ship are formed as follows:

:0MIDxxxxx

where the first figure is zero, and X is any figure from 0 to 9. The particular MID represents only the country assigning the group ship station call identity and so does not prevent group calls to fleets containing more than one ship nationality.

====Coast station identities====
Coast station identities are formed as follows:

:00MIDxxxx

where the first two figures are zeros, and X is any figure from 0 to 9. The MID reflects the country in which the coast station or coast earth station is located.

====Group coast station call identities====
Group coast station call identities for calling simultaneously more than one coast station have the same format as individual coast station IDs: two leading zeros, the MID, and the four digits. They are formed as a subset of coast station identities, as follows:

:00MID0000 for any coast station using the MID
:009990000 for any VHF coast station (regardless of MID)
US Coast Guard stations use a non-standard MMSI: 003669999 - any US Coast Guard Base station
Note that administrations in other countries may use different formats.

Reference: ITU-R Recommendations M.585-7

====Search and Rescue Transmitter====

AIS Search and Rescue Transmitters (AIS-SART) have an identifier related to the manufacturer, rather than a country&#x27;s MID:

:970YYxxxx

The digitals represented by the two Y characters are assigned by the International Association for Marine Electronics Companies and refer to the SART manufacturer, while the Xs are sequential digits assigned by the manufacturer identifying the SART.

===Federal US MMSIs ===
In the United States (one of whose MIDs is 366), federal MMSIs are assigned by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and are normally (but not always) formed as 3669xxxxx. Non-federal MMSIs are assigned by the Federal Communications Commission normally as part of the ship station license application and are formed as 366xxx000 for ships on international voyages and ships needing an Inmarsat mobile earth station, or 366xxxxx0 for all other ships.

The United States Coast Guard group ship station call identity is 036699999, and the group coast station call identity is 003669999.

In the U.S., MMSIs are primarily used for digital selective calling and for assigning Inmarsat identities.

==Exhaustion of MMSIs==
Because all ships on international voyages, as well as all ships fitted with an Inmarsat B or M ship earth station, are assigned MMSIs of the format MIDxxx000, a serious problem has arisen internationally in assigning sufficient numbers of MIDs to all administrations that need them. For example, a country having 10,000 Inmarsat-equipped ships would require 10 MIDs just to accommodate those 10,000 ships. If 50,000 boaters decided to fit small Inmarsat M terminals, 50 additional MIDs would be required to accommodate them.

The problem exists with Inmarsat-equipped ships because ITU-T recommendations require that Inmarsat ship earth stations be assigned the identity (MESIN) TMIDxxxYY, where T indicates the type of Inmarsat station, YY indicates the Inmarsat station extension (e.g.&quot;00&quot; might indicate a telephone in the bridge, &quot;01&quot; might indicate a fax machine in the radio room, etc.), and MIDxxx indicates the ship station number, which relates to the assigned ship station identity MIDxxx000.

The MMSI was meant to be an all-inclusive ship electronic identity, used in one form or another by every GMDSS or telecommunications instrument on the ship. Questions have been raised, however, whether the MMSI can in practice totally fulfill that role. ITU may eventually end the practice of relating Inmarsat MESIN identities with the ship MMSI identity.

To help mitigate against MMSI number exhaustion, manufacturers are required to cripple DSC-capable radios so that an MMSI number can only be entered once, which means that a device owner may not move the radio from one boat to another. This is especially egregious for hand-held VHF devices, for which a single MMSI number makes little sense.

The World Radio Conference, Geneva, 1997 (WRC-97), adopted Resolution 344 concerning the exhaustion of the maritime mobile service identity resource. In view of improvements to public switched telephone networks, and new capabilities of the Inmarsat system other than Inmarsat B or M, previous restrictions should no longer be applicable. All nine digits of the MMSI can be used in such cases, and no longer need to end in trailing zeros.

<text>Albert Louis Johanneson (13 March 1940 – 28 September 1995) was a South African professional footballer who was one of the first high-profile black men, of any nationality, to play top-flight football in England. He is recognised as being the first person of African heritage to play in the FA Cup final, in 1965 for Leeds United.

==Career==
Johanneson, a skilful and swift left winger, was recommended to Leeds United by a South African schoolteacher and joined the club in April 1961. He stayed there for nine years working diligently at his game, and by the 1963–64 season had established himself as a powerful attacking force providing 13 league goals, which assisted in Leeds&#x27; promotion from the Second Division.

In 1965, Johanneson earned his berth in the Leeds team at the Football Association Challenge Cup (F.A Cup) Final played at Wembley Stadium. While Leeds lost the match to Liverpool, and Johanneson regrettably did not play his best, he made history by becoming the first black person to feature in the final of the world-renowned football competition.

Over following seasons, a spate of injuries and the emergence of Eddie Gray left Johanneson on the sidelines, and he made only 10 further starts for Leeds before manager Don Revie released him in 1970. Later that year, Johanneson joined York City, scoring three goals in 26 appearances before retiring.

Life after football did not treat the South African well, and he suffered from addiction to alcohol. Johanneson died of meningitis and heart failure in 1995. He is remembered fondly by Leeds&#x27; fans of the 1960s for using his distinctive natural prowess to illuminate Elland Road.

==Personal life and legacy==

In 1963 Johanneson married Norma Comrie, a pharmacist originally from Jamaica. Together they had two children: Yvonne and Alicia. The couple&#x27;s marriage lasted 11 years, ending in divorce. Albert was dogged by problems with alcohol and ill health before his death in 1995. His body lay undiscovered for a week in his flat in Gledhow Towers, North Leeds. Albert&#x27;s nephew Carl Johanneson is a former Leeds super featherweight boxer.

In January 2019 Leeds United and Leeds Civic Trust unveiled a blue plaque commemorating Johanneson, his contribution to football and the city of Leeds. The ceremony was attended by Johanneson&#x27;s family and ex Leeds United footballer Brian Deane.

In late 2020 a picture of Johanneson was erected on the side of a building in Leeds, featuring himself beside Kalvin Phillips and Lucas Radebe.

==Johanneson in popular culture==

Today, Johanneson is hailed by many as having helped pave the way for the scores of black players that make up the ranks of the English Premiership, especially those with South African roots.

He is also viewed as a courageous pioneer with regard to the racial discrimination he humbly endured from spectators who hurled monkey chants and bananas at him from the sidelines. In the words of footballing legend, George Best within whose era he played: &quot;Albert was quite a brave man to actually go on the pitch in the first place, wasn&#x27;t he? And he went out and did it. He had a lot of skill. A nice man as well ... which is, I suppose, the more important thing, isn&#x27;t it? More important than anything.&quot;

Johanneson features in several chapters of Kester Aspden&#x27;s book &quot;The Hounding of David Oluwale&quot;, about Nigerian immigrant David Oluwale, who lived in Leeds for 20 years during the 50s and 60s. Writes Leeds United bibliographer Sam Gibbard: &quot;Aspden details in several chapters Albert Johanneson and his experiences playing for Leeds United, drawing parallels between the two men, two of just 450 black men living in Leeds during the early 1960s. At the start, their lives couldn’t have been more different, and yet both men’s lives ended tragically and needlessly early&quot;.

Johanneson is currently featured in the Out of Africa Campaign, a UK Heritage Lottery-funded, multimedia project and touring exhibition focused on the contributions of footballers from Africa who have made a substantial contribution to transforming professional football in Britain.

In 2010, Johanneson was featured in an exhibition examining the history of South African footballers in the United Kingdom as part of the FIFA World Cup celebrations that took place in South Africa. The exhibit was researched by the Sheffield-based Football Unites, Racism Divides organisation and was hosted by the historic District Six Museum in Cape Town.

In 2015, FURD and the District Six Museum and illustrator Archie Birch, from Cape Town, have joined forces to tell Albert&#x27;s inspirational, yet sadly poignant story in comic book form: &quot;Albert Johanneson: the First Black Superstar&quot;.

<text>Albert Lewin (September 23, 1894 – May 9, 1968) was an American film director, producer, and screenwriter.

==Personal life==
Lewin was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in Newark, New Jersey. He earned a master&#x27;s degree at Harvard and taught English at the University of Missouri. During World War I, he served in the military and was afterwards appointed assistant national director of the American Jewish Relief Committee. He later became a drama and film critic for the &quot;Jewish Tribune&quot; until the early 1920s, when he went to Hollywood to become a reader for Samuel Goldwyn. Later he worked as a script clerk for directors King Vidor and Victor Sjöström before becoming a screenwriter at MGM in 1924.

Lewin was appointed head of the studio&#x27;s script department and by the late 1920s was Irving Thalberg&#x27;s personal assistant and closest associate. Nominally credited as an associate producer, he produced several of MGM&#x27;s most important films of the 1930s. After Thalberg&#x27;s death, he joined Paramount as a producer in 1937, where he remained until 1941. Notable producing credits during this period include &quot;True Confession&quot; (1937), &quot;Spawn of the North&quot; (1938), &quot;Zaza&quot; (1939) and &quot;So Ends Our Night&quot; (1941).

In 1942, Lewin began to direct. He made six films, writing all of them and producing several himself. As a director and writer, he showed literary and cultural aspirations in the selection and treatment of his themes. He was the best friend of actress Devi Dja and cast her in three of his movies but failed to get her a leading role in &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; (1942). In 1966, Lewin published a novel, &quot;The Unaltered Cat&quot;.

==Films==
As director:
*&quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; (1942)
*&quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1945)
*&quot;The Private Affairs of Bel Ami&quot; (1947)
*&quot;Pandora and the Flying Dutchman&quot; (1951)
*&quot;Saadia&quot; (1953)
*&quot;The Living Idol&quot; (1957)

As screenwriter:
*&quot;The Fate of a Flirt&quot; (1925)
*&quot;Spring Fever&quot; (1927)

<text>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC; , ), also known as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, is a multi-service primary branch of the Iranian Armed Forces. It was officially established by Ruhollah Khomeini as a military branch in May 1979 in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution. Whereas the Iranian Army protects the country&#x27;s sovereignty in a traditional capacity, the IRGC&#x27;s constitutional mandate is to ensure the integrity of the Islamic Republic. Most interpretations of this mandate assert that it entrusts the IRGC with preventing foreign interference in Iran, thwarting coups by the traditional military, and crushing &quot;deviant movements&quot; that harm the ideological legacy of the Islamic Revolution. Currently, the IRGC is designated as a terrorist organization by Bahrain, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and the United States.

, the IRGC had approximately 125,000 total personnel. The IRGC Navy is now Iran&#x27;s primary force exercising operational control over the Persian Gulf. The IRGC&#x27;s Basij, a paramilitary volunteer militia, has about 90,000 active personnel. It operates a media arm, known as &quot;Sepah News&quot; within Iran. On 16 March 2022, it adopted a new independent branch called the &quot;Command for the Protection and Security of Nuclear Centres&quot; involved with Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.

Originating as an ideological militia, the IRGC has taken a greater role in nearly every aspect of Iranian politics, economics (including energy and food industries) and society. In 2010, BBC News described the organization as an &quot;Empire&quot;. In 2019, Reuters described it as &quot;an industrial empire with political clout&quot;. IRGC&#x27;s expanded social, political, military, and economic role under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad—especially during the 2009 presidential election and the suppression of post-election protests—has led many Western analysts to argue that it has surpassed even the country&#x27;s ruling clerical class in terms of political power.

Since 2019, Hossein Salami has served as the IRGC&#x27;s incumbent commander-in-chief.

== Terminology ==
Government organizations in Iran are commonly known by one-word names (that generally denote their function) rather than acronyms or shortened versions, and the general populace universally refers to the IRGC as Sepâh () (Sepoy; Sipahi). &quot;Sepâh&quot; has a historical connotation of soldiers, while in modern Persian it is also used to describe a corps-sized unit – in modern Persian &quot;Artesh&quot; () is the more standard term for an army.

Pâsdârân () is the plural form of Pâsdâr (), meaning &quot;Guardian&quot;, and members of Sepah are known as &quot;Pāsdār&quot;, which is also their title and comes after their rank.

Apart from the name &quot;Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&quot;, the Iranian Government, media, and those who identify with the organization generally use Sepāh-e Pâsdârân (Army of the Guardians), although it is not uncommon to hear Pâsdârân-e Enghelâb () (Guardians of the Revolution), or simply Pâsdârân () (Guardians) as well. Among the Iranian population, and especially among diaspora Iranians, using the word &quot;Pasdaran&quot; indicates hatred or admiration for the organization.

Most foreign governments and the English-speaking mass media tend to use the term Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRG) or simply the Revolutionary Guards. In the US media, the force is frequently referred to interchangeably as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The US government standard is &quot;Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&quot;, while the United Nations uses &quot;Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps&quot;.

== Organization ==

The force&#x27;s main role is to provide national security. It is responsible for internal and border security, law enforcement, and also Iran&#x27;s missile forces. IRGC operations are geared towards asymmetric warfare and less traditional duties. These include the control of smuggling, control of the Strait of Hormuz, and resistance operations. The IRGC is intended to complement the more traditional role of the regular Iranian military, with the two forces operating separately and focusing on different operational roles.

The IRGC is a combined arms force with its own ground forces, navy, air force, intelligence, and special forces. It also controls the Basij militia. The Basij is a volunteer-based force, with 90,000 regular soldiers and 300,000 reservists. The IRGC is officially recognized as a component of the Iranian military under Article 150 of the Iranian Constitution. It is separate from, and parallel to, the other arm of Iran&#x27;s military, which is called Artesh (another Persian word for an army). Especially in the waters of the Persian Gulf, the IRGC is expected to assume control of any Iranian response to attacks on its nuclear facilities.

=== History and structure ===
The IRGC was formed on 5 May 1979 following the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in an effort to consolidate several paramilitary forces into a single force loyal to the new government and to function as a counter to the influence and power of the regular military, initially seen as a potential source of opposition because of its traditional loyalty to the Shah. From the beginning of the new Islamic government, the Pasdaran (Pasdaran-e Enghelab-e Islami) functioned as a corps of the faithful. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic entrusted the defense of Iran&#x27;s territorial integrity and political independence to the regular military (&quot;artesh&quot;), while it gave the Pasdaran the responsibility of preserving the Revolution itself.

Days after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s return to Tehran on 1 February 1979, Mehdi Bazargan&#x27;s interim administration established the Pasdaran under a decree issued by Khomeini on 5 May. The Pasdaran was intended to protect the Revolution and to assist the ruling clerics in the day-to-day enforcement of the new government&#x27;s Islamic codes and morality. There were other, perhaps more important, reasons for establishing the Pasdaran. The Revolution needed to rely on a force of its own rather than borrowing the previous regime&#x27;s tainted units. As one of the first revolutionary institutions, the Pasdaran helped legitimize the Revolution and gave the new government an armed basis of support. Moreover, the establishment of the Pasdaran served notice to both the population and the regular armed forces that the Khomeini government was quickly developing its own enforcement body.

Thus, the Pasdaran, along with its political counterpart, Crusade for Reconstruction, brought a new order to Iran. In time, the Pasdaran would rival the police and the judiciary in terms of its functions.

Although the IRGC operated independently of the regular armed forces, it was often considered to be a military force in its own right due to its important role in Iranian defense. The IRGC consists of ground, naval, and aviation troops, which parallel the structure of the regular military. The Pasdaran was &quot;given control of Iran&#x27;s ballistic missile program in both missile employment and development.

Also contained under the umbrella of the more conventional Pasdaran, were the Basij Forces (Mobilization Resistance Force), a network of potentially up to a million active individuals who could be called upon in times of need. The Basij could be committed to assist in the defense of the country against internal or external threats, but by 2008 had also been deployed in mobilizing voters in elections and alleged tampering during such activities. Another element was the Quds Force, a special forces element tasked with unconventional warfare roles and known to be involved in providing assistance and training to various militant organizations around the world.

The Pasdaran is closely associated with Supreme Leader Khamenei who came to power in 1989, and used the Pasdaran to build support using expropriated state resources. Reportedly he reached &quot;far down into the ranks and appointed new colonels and brigadiers. &#x27;Khamenei micromanages the whole system, so everyone is loyal to him, He is hyperactive. He knows every low-ranking commander and even the names of their children&#x27;&quot;, according to Mehdi Khalaji of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

The Basij and Pasdaran were instrumental in crushing the Green Movement, and this power gave them political supremecy in Iran. According to at least one source (Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford), the regime &quot;clearly ... believed it was going to lose control, and the IRGC and the Basij saved the day. The result is that the IRGC now has the upper hand. Khamenei knows that without the IRGC he&#x27;d be out of a job in twenty-four hours.&quot;

Yahya Rahim Safavi, head of the IRGC since 1997, was dismissed as commander in chief of the Revolutionary Guards in August 2007. The dismissal of Safavi disrupted the balance of power in Iran to the advantage of conservatives. Analysis in the international press considered the removal of Safavi to be a sign of change in the defense strategies of Iran, but the general policies of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps are not personally determined by its commander.

Iran&#x27;s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated in Tehran, Iran on 27 November 2020. Fakhrizadeh was believed to be the primary force behind Iran&#x27;s covert nuclear program for many decades. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Israel&#x27;s Mossad was behind that attack and that Mick Mulroy, the former Deputy Defense Secretary for the Middle East said the death of Fakhirizadeh was &quot;a setback to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program&quot; and he was also a senior officer in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and that &quot;will magnify Iran&#x27;s desire to respond by force.&quot;

The Corps have occasionally distributed food aid packages.

=== Military structure ===
In late July 2008, reports originating that the IRGC was in the process of dramatically changing its structure. In a shake-up, in September 2008 Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards established 31 divisions and an autonomous missile command. The new structure changes the IRGC from a centralized to a decentralized force with 31 provincial corps, whose commanders wield extensive authority and power. According to the plan, each of Iran&#x27;s thirty provinces will have a provincial corps, except Tehran Province, which will have two.

==== Cyber Security Command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ====

In 2007 command for cyber security was established part of cyberdefense of IRGC. It was renamed in 2014, abbreviated GCDC or CIOC.
* Advanced Persistent Threat 34

==== Joint Staff ====
==== Basij ====
Basij Mustazafin were initially separate organization but were merged in 1980 into Corps and merged to its land forces since 2008.
The Basij is a paramilitary volunteer militia or &quot;plainclothes militia&quot; founded by the order of the Ayatollah Khomeini in November 1979. On 4 November 1979, in an address to the Revolutionary Guards during the Iran hostage crisis, Khomeini ordered the creation of an army of &quot;twenty million Iranians&quot; (&quot;Artesh-e bis million&quot;), proclaiming:

Equip yourself, get military training and train your friends. Give military training to those who are not trained. In an Islamic country, everyone should be a soldier and have military training. ... a country with 20 million young people [should have] 20 million riflemen, an army of 20 million&quot;

This pronouncement and Article 151 of the constitution, which calls for the government to &quot;provide a program of military training, with all requisite facilities, for all its citizens, in accordance with the Islamic criteria, in such a way that all citizens will always be able to engage in the armed defense of the Islamic Republic of Iran,&quot; are believed to refer to the Basij. While &quot;Iranian official estimates sometime put their total part-time and full-time strength at more than 20 million&quot;, others estimate the Basij as having &quot;a core strength of 90,000, and up to 600,000&quot; (CSIS, 11 January 2018, p.4); at 100,000 with &quot;hundreds of thousands of additional Basij could be mobilized in the event or an all-out war&quot; (CRS, 23 May 2018, p.18).

The Basij are &quot;the most visible symbol&quot; of the Pasdaran&#x27;s strength, whose members &quot;can be seen on street corners in every Iranian city&quot;. They are (at least in theory) subordinate to, and receive their orders from, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. However they have also been described as &quot;a loosely allied group of organizations&quot; including &quot;many groups controlled by local clerics.&quot; Currently, the Basij serve as an auxiliary force engaged in activities such as internal security as well as law enforcement auxiliary, the providing of social service, organizing of public religious ceremonies, and as morality police and the suppression of dissident gatherings.

==== Quds Force ====

The elite Quds Force (or Jerusalem Force), sometimes described as the successor to the Shah&#x27;s Imperial Guards, is estimated to be 2,000–5,000 in number. It is a special operations unit, handling activities abroad. The force basically does not engage directly.

==== Aerospace Force ====
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air and Space Force (IRGCASF; , officially acronymed NEHSA) is the strategic missile, air, and space force within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Iran. It was renamed from the IRGC Air Force into the IRGC Aerospace Force in 2009. Its 15,000 personnel man around 80 aircraft and operates several thousand short- and medium-range mobile ballistic missiles, including the Shahab-3/3B with a range of up to 2,100 kilometers.

==== Navy ====
IRGC started naval operations using mainly swarm tactics and speedboats during &quot;Tanker War&quot; phase of the Iran–Iraq War.

IRGC Navy and the regular &quot;Artesh&quot; Navy overlap functions and areas of responsibility, but they are distinct in terms of how they are trained and equipped—and more importantly also in how they fight. The Revolutionary Guards Navy has a large inventory of small fast attack craft, and specializes in asymmetric hit-and-run tactics. It is more akin to a guerrilla force at sea, and maintains large arsenals of coastal defense and anti-ship cruise missiles and mines. It has also a Takavar (special force) unit, called Sepah Navy Special Force (S.N.S.F.).
The navy received 750 new ships 2024 July.

==== Ground forces ====
==== Nuclear forces ====
==== Intelligence organization ====

Corps Intelligence directorate are accused of meddling in the 2021 Iranian presidential election.

=== Size ===
The 2020 edition of The Military Balance, published by IISS, says the IRGC has about 190,000 active personnel and controls the Basij on mobilisation (as much as 40,000 active paramilitary forces). It estimates the Ground Force is 150,000 strong and the Aerospace Force, which controls Iran&#x27;s strategic-missile force, has some 15,000 personnel. The Naval Forces are estimated to size at least 20,000, including 5,000 Marines.

=== Senior commanders ===

* Major General Hossein Salami (Commander-in-chief)
* Commodore Ali Fadavi (Second-in-command)
* Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour (Revolutionary Guards&#x27; Ground Forces)
* Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh (Revolutionary Guards&#x27; Aerospace Force)
* Commodore Alireza Tangsiri (Revolutionary Guards&#x27; Navy)
* Brigadier General Gholamreza Soleimani (Commander of the Mobilized Basij forces)
* Brigadier General Esmail Qaani (Quds Force)

=== Iran–Iraq War ===
=== Lebanon Civil War ===

During the Lebanese Civil War, the IRGC allegedly sent troops to train fighters in response to the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. In Lebanon, political parties had staunch opinions regarding the IRGC&#x27;s presence. Some, mainly the Christian militias such as the Lebanese Forces, Phalanges, and most of the Christian groups declared war on the IRGC, claiming they violated Lebanese sovereignty, while others, including Muslim militias, were neutral to their presence. Groups such as the PSP and Mourabiton did not approve of their presence, but to preserve political alliances they decided to remain silent on the matter.

=== 2006 Lebanon War ===
During the 2006 Lebanon War, several Iranian Revolutionary Guards were reportedly killed by Israeli forces in Baalbek, a town close to the Syrian border. Israeli officials believe that Iranian Revolutionary Guards forces were responsible for training and equipping the Hezbollah fighters behind the missile attack on the &quot;INS Hanit&quot; which left four Israeli sailors dead and seriously damaged the vessel.

=== 2006 plane crash ===
In January 2006, an IRGC Falcon crashed near Oroumieh, about 560 miles northwest of Tehran, near the Turkish border, Iranian media reported. All fifteen passengers died, including twelve senior IRGC commanders. Among the dead was General Ahmad Kazemi, the IRGC ground forces commander, and Iran–Iraq War veteran.

Gen. Masoud Jazayeri, spokesman for the IRGC, told state radio that both of the plane&#x27;s engines had failed, its landing gear had jammed, and there was snow and poor visibility at the time.

=== Possible attacks on Quds Force ===
On 7 July 2008, investigative journalist and author Seymour Hersh wrote an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stating that the Bush Administration had signed a presidential finding authorizing the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division to begin cross border paramilitary operations from Iraq and Afghanistan into Iran. These operations would be against the Quds Force, the commando arm of the IRGC that had been blamed for repeated acts of violence in Iraq, and &quot;high-value targets&quot; in the war on terror.

=== October 2009 Pishin bombing ===

In October 2009, several top commanders of the Revolutionary Guards were killed in a suicide bombing in the Pishin region of Sistan-Baluchistan, in the south-east of Iran. The Iranian state television said 31 people died in the attack, and more than 25 were injured. Shia and Sunni tribal leaders were also killed. The Sunni Baluchi insurgent group Jundullah claimed responsibility for the attack. The Iranian government initially blamed the United States for involvement in the attacks, as well as Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and later Pakistan for their alleged support of the Jundallah group. The United States denied involvement, but some reports of US assistance to Jundallah during the Bush administration have come from Western sources. The attacks appear to have originated in Pakistan and several suspects have been arrested.

=== Syria, 2011–present ===
Prior to the Syrian war, Iran had between 2,000 and 3,000 IRGC officers stationed in Syria, helping to train local troops and managing supply routes of arms and money to neighboring Lebanon.

General Qa&#x27;ani, Senior officer of Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, said: &quot;If the Islamic Republic was not present in Syria, the massacre of civilians would have been twice as bad. Had physically and non-physically stopped the rebels from killing many more among the Syrian people.&quot;

Iranian Revolutionary Guard soldiers, along with fellow Shi&#x27;ite forces from Hezbollah and members of Iran&#x27;s Basij militia participated in the capture of Qusair from rebel forces on 9 June 2013. In 2014, Iran increased its deployment of IRGC in Syria.

By late 2015, 194 IRGC troops had been killed in Syria; almost all of these soldiers were officers, with several even reaching the rank of Brigadier. Additionally, 354 Afghan combatants had died who were fighting under the command of the IRGC, as part of the IRGC-equipped and trained Fatemiyoun Brigade, which is part of Hezbollah Afghanistan. Another 21 Pakistanis also died as part of the Zainabiyoun Brigade.

The Afghan and Pakistani immigrants volunteered to go to Syria in exchange for salaries and citizenship. The Afghans were recruited largely from refugees inside Iran, and usually had combat experience before joining the IRGC; their status as members of the Iranian military is only vaguely acknowledged and sometimes denied, despite the troops being uniformed fighters led by IRGC officers. They were trained and equipped in Iran, paid salaries by the Iranian military, and received state funerals involving uniformed IRGC personnel. Mid to late October 2015 was particularly bloody for the IRGC, due to them stepping up their involvement in offensives around Aleppo. During this time, 30 IRGC officers, including &quot;three generals, battalion commanders, captains and lieutenants&quot; and &quot;one pilot&quot; were killed in fighting in Syria, as were several Afghan and Pakistani auxiliaries.

The fallen included General Hossein Hamadani, Farshad Hosounizadeh (IRGC colonel and former commander of the Saberin Special Forces Brigade), Mostafa Sadrzadeh (commander of the Omar Battalion of the Fatmiyoon Brigade), and Hamid Mojtaba Mokhtarband (IRGC commander).

=== Iraq, 2014–present ===

Two battalions of Revolutionary Guards were reported to be operating in Iraq trying to combat the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. The IRGC is considered to be a principle backer of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a loose coalition of Shi&#x27;a militias allied with the Iraqi government in its fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Major General Qasem Soleimani was an instrumental force in the Iranian ground mission in Iraq against ISIS, purportedly planning the Second Battle of Tikrit.

In December 2014, Brigadier General Hamid Taqavi, a veteran of the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War, was killed by snipers in Samarra. In May 2017, Shaaban Nassiri, a senior IRGC commander was killed in combat near Mosul, Iraq. In December 2019, the U.S. Air Force conducted airstrikes on weapons caches and facilities of the IRGC-sponsored militant group Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah. In retaliation, the group attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in the Green Zone.

On 3 January 2020, Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad International Airport along with the PMF commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

=== 2014 Israeli drone shoot down ===
Iran revolutionary guards said that they had shot down an Israeli drone approaching the Natanz nuclear facility. According to ISNA, &quot;The downed aircraft was of the stealth, radar-evasive type ... and was targeted by a ground-to-air missile before it managed to enter the area.&quot; The statement by revolutionary guards did not mention how they recognized it as an Israeli drone. Israel offered no comment.

=== Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 ===
Iranian authorities initially denied responsibility for the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 incident. However, the IRGC later admitted that the plane had been shot down by mistake.

The Aerospace Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps took &quot;full responsibility&quot; for unintentionally shooting down the airplane with a surface-to-air missile on 8 January 2020. President Hassan Rouhani stated that the plane was approaching an IRGC base when it was shot down: according to a senior Revolutionary Guards commander, the plane was mistaken for a cruise missile.
On 17 January 2020, the IRGC were protected by Ali Khamenei in the Friday sermon. He said that the downing was a &quot;bitter&quot; tragedy and additionally declared that &quot;Iran&#x27;s enemies&quot; used the crash and the military&#x27;s admission to &quot;weaken&quot; the IRGC.

=== Special Operation inside Pakistan ===
On 3 February 2021, IRGC announced that it had conducted an intelligence-based operation inside Pakistani territory to rescue two of its border guards who were taken as hostages by Jaish ul-Adl organization two and a half years ago.

=== Involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war ===
On 21 October 2022, a White House press release stated that Iranian troops were in Crimea assisting Russia in launching drone attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure. On 24 November, Ukrainian officials said the military had killed ten Iranians and would target any further Iranian military presence in Ukraine. The Institute for the Study of War assessed that these are likely Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or IRGC-affiliated personnel, as this formation is the primary operator of Iranian drones.

=== April 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel ===
On 13 April 2024, the IRGC, in collaboration with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, Hezbollah, and the Ansar Allah (Houthis), launched retaliatory attacks against Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights with loitering munitions, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. It was retaliation for the Israeli bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus on 1 April, which killed two Iranian generals. The strike was seen as a spillover of the Israel–Hamas war and marked Iran&#x27;s first direct attack on Israel since the start of their proxy conflict. The attack was the largest attempted drone strike in history, intended to overwhelm anti-aircraft defenses. It was the first time since Iraq&#x27;s 1991 missile strikes that Israel was directly attacked by a state force.

== Influence ==
=== Political ===
As an elite group, members of Pasdaran have influence in Iran&#x27;s political world. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (President 2005–2013) joined the IRGC in 1985, serving first in military operation in Iraqi Kurdistan before leaving the front line to take charge of logistics. A majority of his first cabinet consisted of IRGC veterans. Nearly one third of the members elected to Iran&#x27;s Majlis in 2004 are also &quot;Pásdárán&quot;. Others have been appointed as ambassadors, mayors, provincial governors and senior bureaucrats. However, IRGC veteran status does not imply a single viewpoint.

Strengthening the power of the IRGC was their actions against the Green Movement, where thousands of Iranians protested election irregularities in the 2009 victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over &quot;a well-liked&quot; reformer Mir-Hossein Mousavi. As &quot;the demonstrations gained strength, the security forces swept in, arresting, beating, and killing protesters&quot;. The IRGC was thought to be crucial in crushing the movement which &quot;marked a turning point&quot; for the Islamic Republic.

In a video leaked to the internet, the leader of the Pasdaran at the time, (General Mohammad Ali Jafari), opposed the protest as challenging &#x27;the tenets of the revolution&#x27;, but warned that it &#x27;was a blow that weakened the fundamental pillars of the regime,&#x27; and demonstrated that Iran&#x27;s rulers &quot;could no longer count on popular support&quot;, &#x27;Anyone who refuses to understand these new conditions will not be successful&#x27;.

Ayatollah Khomeini urged that the country&#x27;s military forces should remain unpoliticized. However, the Constitution, in Article 150, defines the IRGC as the &quot;guardian of the Revolution and of its achievements&quot; which is at least partly a political mission. His original views have therefore been the subject of debate. Supporters of the Basiji have argued for politicization, while reformists, moderates and Hassan Khomeini opposed it. President Rafsanjani forced military professionalization and ideological deradicalization on the IRGC to curb its political role, but the Pasdaran became natural allies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei when reformists threatened him. The IRGC grew stronger under President Ahmedinejad, and assumed formal command of the Basiji militia in early 2009.

Although never explicitly endorsing or affiliating themselves with any political parties, the Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran (or Abadgaran), is widely viewed as a political front for the Revolutionary Guards. Many former members (including Ahmadinejad) have joined this party in recent years and the Revolutionary Guards have reportedly given them financial support.

=== Economic activity ===
IRGC first expanded into commercial activity through informal social networking of veterans and former officials. IRGC officials confiscated assets of many refugees who had fled Iran after the fall of Abolhassan Banisadr&#x27;s government. It is now a vast conglomerate, controlling Iran&#x27;s missile batteries and nuclear program but also a multibillion-dollar business empire reaching almost all economic sectors. Estimates of the fraction of Iran&#x27;s economy that it controls through a series of subsidiaries and trusts vary from ten percent to over 50.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; estimates that IRGC has ties to over one hundred companies, with its annual revenue exceeding $12 billion in business and construction. IRGC has been awarded billions of dollars in contracts in the oil, gas and petrochemical industries, as well as major infrastructure projects.

The following commercial entities have been named by the United States as owned or controlled by the IRGC and its leaders.
* Khatam al-Anbia Construction Headquarters, the IRGC&#x27;s major engineering arm &amp; one of Iran&#x27;s largest contractors employing about 25,000 engineers and staff on military (70%) and non-military (30%) projects worth over $7 billion in 2006.
* Oriental Oil Kish (oil and gas industry)
* Ghorb Nooh
* Sahel Consultant Engineering
* Ghorb Karbala
* Sepasad Engineering Co. (excavation and tunnel construction)
* Omran Sahel
* Hara Company (excavation and tunnel construction)
* Gharargahe Sazandegi Ghaem
* Imensazen Consultant Engineers Institute (subsidiary of Khatam al-Anbia)
* Fater Engineering Institute (subsidiary of Khatam al-Anbia)

In September 2009, the Government of Iran sold 51% of the shares of the Telecommunication Company of Iran to the Mobin Trust Consortium (Etemad-e-Mobin), a group affiliated with the Guards, for the sum of $7.8 billion. This was the largest transaction on the Tehran Stock Exchange in history. IRGC also owns 45% participation in automotive Bahman Group and has a majority stake in Iran&#x27;s naval giant SADRA through Khatam al-Anbia.

The IRGC also exerts influence over &quot;bonyads&quot;, wealthy, non-governmental ostensibly charitable foundations controlled by key clerics. The pattern of revolutionary foundations mimics the style of informal and extralegal economic networks from the time of the Shah. Their development started in the early 1990s, gathered pace over the next decade, and accelerated even more with many lucrative no-bid contracts from the Ahmadinejad presidency. The IRGC exerts informal, but real, influence over many such organizations including:
* Mostazafan Foundation (Foundation of the Oppressed or The Mostazafan Foundation)
* Bonyad Shahid va Omur-e Janbazan (Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs)

As an elite force with great economic assets it has developed into what some observers call an &quot;untouchable élite&quot; and somewhat isolated in Iranian society. According to a &quot;former senior Middle Eastern intelligence officer&quot;, the Guard and their families &quot;have their own schools, their own markets, their own neighborhoods, their own resorts. The neighborhoods look like a carbon copy of Beverly Hills.&quot;

Former Bank Ansar and Bank Mehr Iranian were run by corps IRGC Cooperation Bonyad until merger with state Bank Sepah.

In 2023, Israel seized millions of dollars in cryptocurrency belonging to Hezbollah and the Quds force of the IRGC.

=== Analysis ===
Mehdi Khalaji of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy argues that the IRGC is &quot;the spine of the current political structure and a major player in the Iranian economy.&quot; The once theocratic state has evolved into a garrison state, like Burma, whereby the military dominates social, cultural, political, and economic life, protecting the government from internal rather than external opponents.

Greg Bruno and Jayshree Bajoria of the Council on Foreign Relations agree, stating that the IRGC has expanded well beyond its mandate and into a &quot;socio-military-political-economic force&quot; that deeply penetrates Iran&#x27;s power structure. &quot;The Guards&#x27; involvement in politics has grown to unprecedented levels since 2004, when IRGC won at least 16 percent of the 290 seats&quot; in the Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran. During the elections of March 2008, IRGC veterans won 182 out of 290 seats, helping Mahmoud Ahmadinejad consolidate power.

Half of Ahmadinejad&#x27;s cabinet was composed of former IRGC officers while several others were appointed to provincial governorships.

Ali Alfoneh of the American Enterprise Institute contends that &quot;While the presence of former IRGC officers in the cabinet is not a new phenomenon, their numbers under Ahmadinejad—they occupy nine of the twenty-one ministry portfolios—are unprecedented.&quot; Additionally, Ahmadinejad successfully purged provincial governorships of Rafsanjani and Khatami supporters and replaced them not only with IRGC members, but also members of the Basij and the Islamic Republic prison administration.

The IRGC chief, General Mohammad Ali Jafari, announced that the Guards&#x27; would go through internal restructuring in order to counter &quot;internal threats to the Islamic Republic.&quot; Bruce Riedel, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and former CIA analyst, argues the Guards was created to protect the government against a possible coup.

Since the disputed 2009 presidential elections, debate over how powerful the IRGC is has reemerged. Danielle Pletka and Ali Alfoneh see the irreversible militarization of Iran&#x27;s government. Abbas Milani, director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University, believes the Guards&#x27; power actually exceeds that of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Frederic Wehrey, adjunct Senior Fellow at the RAND Corporation believes the Revolutionary Guards is not a cohesive unit of similar-minded conservatives but rather a factionalized institution that is hardly bent on overthrowing their masters.

=== U.S. Department of the Treasury terrorist aid claims ===
The U.S. Department of the Treasury claims the Corp has supported several organizations the U.S. deems to be terrorist, including Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC), and the Taliban. In the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#x27;s report, four IRGC senior officials, Hushang Alladad, Hossein Musavi, Hasan Mortezavi, and Mohammad Reza Zahedi, were specifically named for providing support to terrorist organizations. Hushang Alladad, a financial officer for the IRGC, was cited as personally administering financial support to terrorist groups including Hizballah, Hamas, and PIJ.

Both General Hossein Musavi and Colonel Hasan Mortevazi were claimed to have provided financial and material support to the Taliban. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, the IRGC commander in Lebanon, was claimed to have played a crucial role in Iran&#x27;s aid to Hizballah. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Zahedi served as a liaison to Hizballah and Syrian intelligence services as well as taking part in weapon deals involving Hizballah.

The U.S. Treasury report goes on to detail the IRGC&#x27;s methods of support for terrorist groups: &quot;The Government of Iran also uses the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and IRGC-QF to implement its foreign policy goals, including, but not limited to, seemingly legitimate activities that provide cover for intelligence operations and support to terrorist and insurgent groups. These activities include economic investment, reconstruction, and other types of aid to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Lebanon, implemented by companies and institutions that act for or on behalf of, or are owned or controlled by the IRGC and the Iranian government.&quot;

== Controversy ==

From its origin as an ideologically driven militia, the IRGC has taken an ever more assertive role in virtually every aspect of Iranian society. Its part in suppressing dissent has led many analysts to describe the events surrounding the 12 June 2009 presidential election as a military coup, and the IRGC as an authoritarian military security government for which its Shiite clerical system is no more than a facade.

Since its establishment, IRGC has been involved in many economic and military activities among which some raised controversies. The organization has been accused of smuggling (including importing illegal alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and satellite dishes, into Iran via jetties not supervised by the Government), training and supplying Hezbollah and Hamas fighters, and of being involved in the Iraq War.

In December 2009, evidence uncovered during an investigation by the Guardian newspaper and Guardian Films linked the IRGC to the kidnappings of 5 Britons from a government ministry building in Baghdad in 2007. Three of the hostages, Jason Creswell, Jason Swindlehurst and Alec Maclachlan, were killed. Alan Mcmenemy&#x27;s body was never found but Peter Moore was released on 30 December 2009. The investigation uncovered evidence that Moore, 37, a computer expert from Lincoln was targeted because he was installing a system for the Iraqi Government that would show how a vast amount of international aid was diverted to Iran&#x27;s militia groups in Iraq.

According to Geneive Abdo, IRGC members were appointed &quot;as ambassadors, mayors, cabinet ministers, and high-ranking officials at state-run economic institutions&quot; during the administration of president Ahmadinejad. Appointments in 2009 by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei have given &quot;hard-liners&quot; in the guard &quot;unprecedented power&quot; and included &quot;some of the most feared and brutal men in Iran.&quot;

In May 2019, the United States accused the IRGC of being &quot;directly responsible&quot; for an attack on commercial ships in the Gulf of Oman. Michael M. Gilday, United States director of the Joint Staff, described US intelligence attributing that the IRGC used limpet mines to attack four oil tankers anchored in the Gulf of Oman for bunkering through the Port of Fujairah.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the IRGC unveiled the Mostaan 110, an experimental medical device that the IRGC claimed could detect instances of COVID-19 using electromagnetic radiation. The IRGC&#x27;s claims of Mostaan 110&#x27;s capabilities were met with widespread criticism from both Iranian and international experts, who called it pseudoscientific and compared it to the ADE 651, a fake explosive detector with a similar design.

In December 2022, German authorities accused the IRGC of attempting to orchestrate attacks against synagogues in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and spying on the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Moreover, in 2020, IRGC members were exposed as having given a talk to UK students in which one spoke of an apocalyptic war with Jews.

In July 2024, it was suspected that the IRGC had attempted to assassinate the former Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

=== Terrorist designation and sanctions ===

Since 15 April 2019, the United States, which opposes the activities of Sepah, considers the IRGC as a terrorist organization, which some top CIA and Pentagon officials reportedly opposed. On 8 April, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted in Hebrew that America&#x27;s terrorist designation was the fulfillment of &quot;another important request of mine.&quot; This designation was criticized by a number of governments including Turkey, Iraq and China as well as the Islamic Consultative Assembly, Iran&#x27;s parliament, in which members wore IRGC uniforms in protest.

On 29 April 2019, United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy said Iran posed five threats. The first was Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. The second was to maritime security in the Straits of Hormuz and the Bab al-Mandab, because a substantial portion of energy trade and commercial goods go through those areas. The third was because of their support to proxies and terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, Houthis in Yemen, some Hashd al-Shaabi in Iraq and safe-harboring senior al-Qaeda leaders in Iran. The fourth was Iranian made ballistic missiles sent to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen for use against Saudi Arabia and to Syria with Hezbollah to use against Israel. Cyber is the fifth threat and a growing concern. He also said that the terrorist designation did not grant any additional authorities to the Department of Defense and that they were not asking for any.

The IRGC has never been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, although the UNSCR 1929 had its assets frozen (this was lifted in 2016). Since 2010, the European Union has imposed broad sanctions on the IRGC and many of its members, without designating it as a terrorist organization.

Although Saudi Arabia and Bahrain already designated the IRGC as a terrorist organisation, several countries such as Australia are examining the possibility to designate the group as well. Canada outlawed the Quds Force in 2012. On 3 October 2022, in reaction to the death of Mahsa Amini and the persecution of protestors in the protests that ensued, Canada officially sanctioned the IRGC. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly announced sanctions targeting 9 entities, including the Morality Police and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, and 25 individuals, that include high-ranking officials and members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. These individuals include IRGC Commander-in-Chief Major General Hossein Salami, and Esmail Qaani, commander of the Quds Force of the IRGC.

On 7 October, the Canadian government expanded the sanctions, banning 10,000 members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from entering the country permanently, which represents the top 50% of the organization&#x27;s leadership. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau added that Canada plans to expand the sanctions against those most responsible for Iran&#x27;s &quot;egregious behavior&quot;. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added that Iran was a &quot;state sponsor of terror&quot;, and that &quot;it is oppressive, theocratic and misogynist; The IRGC leadership are terrorists, the IRGC is a terrorist organization&quot;.

According to &quot;Arab News&quot;, a 2020 report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change said that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is an &quot;institutionalized militia&quot; that &quot;uses its vast resources to spread a &#x27;mission of jihad&#x27; through an &#x27;ideological army&#x27; of recruits and proxies&quot;. In 2022, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the IRGC is &quot;probably the most designated organisation – one way or another – in the world among the organisations that we designate, including the foreign terrorist organisation designation&quot;.

In January 2023, it was reported that the United Kingdom was preparing to declare the IRGC a terrorist organization; this did not subsequently occur.

On 18 January 2023, the European Parliament passed an amendment proposed by the ECR Group, to call for the EU and its member states to include the IRGC on the EU&#x27;s terrorist list.

On 19 June 2024, Canada designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization under the nation&#x27;s Criminal Code.

=== Response to terrorist organization designation ===
The move was met with unfavorable reactions from Iranian leaders and militants. Shortly after the US announced the designation, the Iranian government declared the United States Central Command, whose area of responsibility includes the Middle East, as a terrorist organization. According to Iran&#x27;s Supreme National Security Council, the move &quot;was in response to the illegal and unwise move from the U.S.&quot; The next day, Iranian Members of Parliament displayed their support of the IRGC by collectively wearing green military pants and chanted &quot;death to America&quot; as they opened session. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani also responded to the move, commenting that it was a mistake which would only increase the IRGC&#x27;s popularity in Iran and elsewhere.

Since the designation, the United States Department of State&#x27;s Rewards for Justice Program has offered a reward of up to US$15 million for financial background information about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its branches, including an IRGC financier, Abdul Reza Shahlai, who it says was responsible for a raid that killed five American soldiers in Karbala, Iraq on 20 January 2007.

<text>The [[BMW]] M47 and [[Rover Group]] M47R are straight-4 Diesel engines. Variants were manufactured by BMW from 1998 to 2007. BMW gradually adopted high-pressure common rail fuel injection systems over the lifetime of the M47.

==M47D20==

The original M47 diesel engine featured non-common-rail direct fuel injection and a block. First seen in 1998, the M47D20 produced and in its original 320d/520d guise, and with in the 318d variant. All M47 engines have one Swirl and one Tangential intake port per cylinder, which can each improve performance under different conditions. These features are not to be confused with swirl flaps, which were introduced in the M47D20TÜ.

Applications:
* and 
** 2001–2003 E46 318d
* and 
** 1999–2001 E46 320d
** 2000–2003 E39 520d

==M47R==

Rover Group (UK) and Steyr (Austria), worked together to modify the M47D20 to create a transverse configuration for use in the Rover 75 front wheel drive saloon, as well as their all-wheel-drive Land Rover Freelander. The same engine was later deployed by MG Rover in the Rover 75 Tourer and MG ZT. The M47R (&quot;M47 Rail&quot;) differs from the original design by the introduction of common-rail technology, a transverse orientation, different turbochargers and more sophisticated systems for temperature management. However, the core heads of the M47R and M47D20 are the same. Combining a common-rail system with a relatively small engine capacity created engine temperature problems. More hardware was added to help control temperatures which also helped to escalate weight, fuel consumption, and manufacturing costs. The BMW Steyr plant manufactured and supplied M47R engines. The original version used in the Rover 75 developed at 4000rpm and at 2000rpm. A software update developed in conjunction with X Power, and released in 2002 after Rover&#x27;s separation from BMW, increased this to at 3500 rpm and at 1900rpm, and was badged CDTi rather than CDT.

The M47R in the Rover 75 and MG ZT used a Mitsubishi turbocharger with wastegate, whereas that fitted to the Freelander used a Garrett VNT.

Applications:
* 1999–2004 Rover 75 CDT
* 2002–2005 Rover 75 CDTi
* 2001–2006 Land Rover Freelander
* 2001–2004 MG ZT CDT
* 2002–2005 MG ZT CDTi

== M47D20TÜ==

The all-wheel drive BMW X3 and rear-wheel drive BMW 320d models, built approximately between September 2001 and December 2004, were fitted with the M47TÜ (&quot;M47 Technical Update&quot;). The exact production week is not known and was probably later than Production Week 33 in 2001 (e.g. one cannot rely on a UK 51 plate registered BMW 320d to have the M47TÜ).

The engine capacity was expanded to , and it retained the common-rail injector system that had proven popular in the smaller M47R and larger M57 engines. These changes empowered BMW to increase torque and improve fuel consumption, especially at lower revs. However, these modifications added to overall weight and emissions raised accordingly. In the UK, the new characteristics of the M47TÜ were sufficient to lift the BMW 320d into the next highest insurance bracket, and the next highest band for Vehicle Excise Duty (Road Tax).

The M47TÜ was regarded as so good that BMW made it available in the 320Cd Coupé.

The M47D20TÜ introduced new common failure points. Chief among these was a new &#x27;swirl flap&#x27; mechanism embedded in the inlet manifold. This consisted of a number of butterfly valves within each individual inlet tract, which are secured to an actuating rod via two small screws. It has become clear that over time these screws can come loose via vibration etc. When this happens they can end up being drawn into the respective cylinder, causing significant damage to the piston, cylinder head, and valves. If unlucky further damage can be caused to the turbo if the screw then makes its way through the exhaust valve into the manifold and subsequently into the turbo. These failures have occurred in such quantity that a number of specialist BMW magazines have featured articles on the problem including information on how to remove the swirl flaps. For those who wish to perform some preventive maintenance on the M47TUD20 engine, there are companies who supply and/or fit blanking plugs to allow the removal of these swirl flaps altogether. BMW addressed the problem by introducing stronger swirl flaps and larger diameter spindles – made from plastic – in 2006.

Applications:
* and 
** 2003–2005 E46 318d
* and 
** 2001–2005 E46 320d
** E83 X3 2.0d (up to end of 2006)

== M47D20TÜ2==

The engine was updated again in 2004 as the M47D20TÜ2 (for &quot;Technische Überarbeitung 2&quot; = second revision). Still at , it produced more power across the range.

Applications:
* and 
** E87 118d
** E90/E91 318d
* and 
** E60/E61 520d
** E87 120d
** E90/E91 320d
** E83 X3 2.0d (end of 2006 onwards)

<doc id="1285478" wikidata="Q6901325" url="?curid=1285478" title="Monoarthritis">
<text>Monoarthritis, or monoarticular arthritis, is inflammation (&quot;arthritis&quot;) of one joint at a time (as opposed to oligoarthritis, which affects 2-4 joints, and polyarthritis, which affects more than 4 joints). It is usually caused by trauma, infection, or crystalline arthritis.

==Causes==

===Septic arthritis===
Septic arthritis is an inflammatory response to an infection (usually bacterial) in the joint. Usually impacting large joints like the hip or the knee, it is a medical emergency with a mortality rate of about 10%. It is treated with oral and intravenous antibiotics as well as joint drainage.

===Gout===
Gout is inflammation caused by the deposition of needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals in the joints. It is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis in the United States. The disease typically affects a single joint in earlier stages but can progress into polyarthritis over time. It usually occurs in cooler areas of the body, often starting in the big toe.

===Pseudogout===
Pseudogout (also referred to as calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease) is another type of crystalline arthritis that presents very similarly to gout but is caused by the deposition of rhomboid-shaped calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. The knees, wrists, and fingers are the most common joints affected by pseudogout.

===Osteoarthritis===
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative, or non-inflammatory arthritis. It is the most common type of arthritis, affecting between 19% and 30% of adults above the age of 45. It is caused by a progressive erosion of cartilage which eventually leads to bone damage. It is a polyarthritis, but it usually begins in a single joint. Unlike other types of monoarthritis, which normally have acute onset, onset of osteoarthritis is almost always insidious.

===Psoriatic arthritis===
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis common in people with psoriasis. It often presents as asymmetric oligoarthritis (impacting 2-4 joints) affecting the distal interphalangeal joints, although it can appear in a single joint. Joint-area discoloration, dactylitis, nail changes, and enthesitis, are common symptoms of psoriatic arthritis that distinguish it from other forms of arthritis. Unlike other types of inflammatory arthritis, which typically affect women more than men, psoriatic arthritis has no gender preference.

==Diagnosis==
X-rays, MRI scans, and other types of imaging can show bone loss and erosion from degenerative arthritis or later stages of inflammatory arthritis. Laboratory testing, specifically microscopic synovial fluid examination, is a more accurate method of diagnosing arthritis. By performing a joint aspiration, physicians can check cell counts and look for signs of infection (bacteria/fungus) or crystal formation to determine which, if any, type of arthritis is present.

==Treatment==
Monoarthritis is treated the same way as other forms of arthritis. Minimizing pain, preventing disease progression, and improving joint function are the goals of arthritis treatment. Treatment can vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition. Physical therapy, acupuncture, and anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used to treat the disease. In more severe cases, intra-articular corticosteroid injections or surgical joint replacement may be necessary. Joint drainage and antibiotics are used to treat septic arthritis. Medications that decrease uric acid can mitigate chronic gout symptoms.

<text>Târgu Secuiesc (; , ; ; ) is a city in Covasna County, Transylvania, Romania. It administers one village, Lunga (&quot;Nyújtód&quot;).

== History ==
The town was first mentioned in 1407 as &quot;Torjawasara&quot;, meaning in Hungarian “Torja Market”. (Torja is the name of a stream nearby and is also the Hungarian name of the nearby village Turia.) Originally, the Hungarian name Kézdivásárhely was also used in Romanian in the form Chezdi-Oșorheiu, but this was altered to Tîrgu Secuiesc (now spelled Târgu Secuiesc) after the accession to Romania in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon. The Hungarian native name means “Kézdi Market”, Kézdi being the name of a Székely “seat”, a historical administrative unit. Its status as a market town dates back to the Middle Ages. The city was taken over by Hungary during World War II, following the Second Vienna Award of August, 1940. A small Jewish community was set up in the 1880s; it numbered 66 in 1920. In May 1944, the Hungarian authorities sent its members to the Sfântu Gheorghe ghetto, and deported them to the Auschwitz concentration camp the following month. Sovereignty was restored to Romania following the war.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Târgu Secuiesc had a population of 16,243; of those, 84,78% were Székely Hungarians and 6.02% Romanians. At the census from 2011, the city had 18,491 residents, of whom 91.1% were Székely Hungarians, 7.2% Romanians, and 1.6% Roma. The historical demographic evolution is as follows:

&quot;Demographic change according to census data:&quot;

==Natives==
* János Balogh
* Andrei Cadar
* André de Dienes
* Róbert Elek
* Tiberiu Ghioane
* Kató Havas
* Gergely Kovács
* Béla Markó
* Roland Niczuly
* Ioan Robu
* Árpád Szántó
* Nándor Tamás
* Gábor Vajna

==Education==
Despite its relatively small size the town has a few notable high schools: Nagy Mózes, Bod Péter, Apor Péter and Gábor Áron, all bearing the names of important Székely historical personalities. Because of this, Târgu Secuiesc is considered the educational center of the north eastern part of the county.

<text>The Night Climbers of Cambridge is a book, written under the pseudonym &quot;Whipplesnaith&quot;, about nocturnal climbing on the colleges and town buildings of Cambridge, England, in the 1930s. The book remains popular among Cambridge University students and the 1930s and 1950s editions can be hard to find. It is often credited with popularising and inspiring the first generation of urban explorers and night climbers.

==History==
After extensive research, it was revealed that &quot;Whipplesnaith&quot; is a pseudonym for Noël Howard Symington, who feared retribution for his work. Eric Waddams, a choral scholar at Kings, who either took or featured in most of the photographs, was a contributor. There was also a third unknown contributor.

The book was originally published in October 1937 by Chatto and Windus and proved popular. The book was revised in November 1937 and reprinted in 1952 and 1953, selling out each time. The second edition contains a reordered selection of photographs and a missing diagram explaining the escape from the roof of the Marks and Spencer, as well as other useful information on night climbing.

The book was sought after, especially in Cambridge itself where it was regarded as one of few &quot;guidebooks&quot; to the routes onto the roofs of the town&#x27;s ancient buildings. Famous climbs documented in the book are the King&#x27;s College and St John&#x27;s College chapels and the &quot;Senate House leap&quot; across Senate House Passage between Gonville and Caius College and the Senate House. &quot;The Night Climbers of Cambridge&quot; is often credited with inspiring the next generation of urban explorers and spawned many University of Cambridge legends and traditions. Since its publication several climbs of King&#x27;s College Chapel have been completed.

A new authorised edition was published on 26 October 2007 by Oleander Press, Cambridge, to mark the 70th anniversary of the original edition. The new edition includes images digitally remastered from the original negatives, and has proved popular among Oxbridge students and urban explorers.

==Similar projects==
In addition to &quot;The Night Climbers of Cambridge&quot;, an omnibus edition of &quot;The Roof Climber&#x27;s Guide to Trinity&quot; was published on 11 July 2011 by Oleander Press. Its introduction contains further details about Symington and his book. In addition it included not before seen information on night-climbing and urban exploring in Cambridge and the surrounding towns, villages and country houses. The &quot;Roof Climber&#x27;s Guide to Trinity&quot; has remained popular, though it is easier to find in bookshops than the original &quot;Night Climbers&quot;.

Given its sometimes clandestine nature, some Cambridge students have described &quot;The Night Climbers of Cambridge&quot; as a modern day Marauder&#x27;s Map of Harry Potter fame. In 2014, a team of Cambridge engineers designed an online app called the &quot;Cambridge Marauders Map&quot;, which allowed friends to view their movements within the colleges of Cambridge and identify potential hazards. The Marauders Map app included many climbing and urban exploring features taken from &quot;The Night Climbers of Cambridge&quot;. The app is no longer publicly available.

==Legacy==
Symington stood for Harborough in 1950 as an independent Mosleyite candidate, receiving 273 votes. In 1958 he published the book &quot;Return to Responsibility: A New Concept of the Case for Fascism in the Post-War World&quot;.

Eric Waddams was head of music at Elizabeth College, Guernsey in the 1950s and 1960s.

&quot;The Night Climbers of Cambridge&quot; is repeatedly referred to in &quot;The Bad Quarto&quot;, a mystery novel by Jill Paton Walsh. Her novel mentions a supposed additional chapter regarding night climbing in St Agatha&#x27;s College, the fictional Cambridge setting for most of Walsh&#x27;s stories about Imogen Quy, college nurse at St Agatha&#x27;s. Night climbing plays a central role in &quot;The Bad Quarto&quot;, along with a production of the 1603 quarto version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

<text>Braj Bihari Kachru (15 May 1932 – 29 July 2016) was an Indian-American linguist. He was Jubilee Professor of Linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He published studies on the Kashmiri language.

==Personal life==
Braj Bihari Kachru was a friend of Kashmiri poet and writer Zinda Kaul &quot;Masterji&quot;. Lala Sahab and his friends and colleagues had discussions on politics, literature and philosophy at his house. During their visits, Braj had the opportunity to interact with &quot;Masterji&quot; and his father&#x27;s other teacher colleagues.

In 1962 Kachru gained a PhD in Linguistics from the University of Edinburgh. His wife was fellow linguist Yamuna Kachru. Their son, Shamit Kachru, is a string theorist and professor at Stanford University. He died on 29 July 2016.

==Career==
He researched in the fields of World Englishes and Kashmiri language and published several books and research papers related to the field.

===Scholar and educationist===
At the University of Illinois, Braj headed the Department of Linguistics (1968–79), directed the Division of English as an International Language (1985–91), and was director of the Center for Advanced Study (June 1996 – January 2000). At the Linguistic Institute of the Linguistic Society of America, he was appointed director in 1978. He was president of American Association of Applied Linguistics (1984). He was named Jubilee Professor of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Illinois in 1992. In 1998, he became the Sir Edward Youde Memorial Fund Visiting Professor at Hong Kong University. He went on to become the president of the International Association for World Englishes (1997–99), and eventually the &quot;Honorary Fellow&quot; of the Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages, now English and Foreign Languages University in Hyderabad, India, in 2001.

===Writer and author===
Kachru has been on the editorial board of &quot;Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural development&quot;, &quot;International Journal of the Sociology of Languages&quot;, &quot;Asian Englishes&quot;, and &quot;Linguistics and the Human Sciences&quot;. Along with authoring &quot;The Alchemy of English: The Spread, Functions and Models of Non-Native Englishes&quot;, Kachru is also the associate editor for &quot;Contributor to the Cambridge History of the English Language&quot; and the acclaimed &quot;The Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot;.

==The circles of English==

To better understand the use of English in different countries, Kachru conceived the idea of three concentric circles of the language.

The inner circle represents the traditional bases of English: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and South Africa and some of the Caribbean territories. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

Next comes the outer circle, which includes countries where English is not the native tongue, but is important for historical reasons and plays a part in the nation&#x27;s institutions, either as an official language or otherwise. This circle includes India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, Tanzania, Kenya, non-Anglophone South Africa and Canada, etc. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.

Finally, the expanding circle encompasses those countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a foreign language or lingua franca. This includes much of the rest of the world&#x27;s population, including China, Russia, Japan, most of Europe, Korea, Egypt, Indonesia, and other nations. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimated because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually business English. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US, etc.) is &#x27;norm-providing&#x27;. That means that English language norms are developed in these countries – English is the first language there. The outer circle (mainly New Commonwealth countries) is &#x27;norm-developing&#x27;. The expanding circle, which includes much of the rest of the world, is &#x27;norm-dependent&#x27; because it relies on the standards set by native speakers in the inner circle.

It was designed from July 1984 as a replacement for the tactical road-mobile Pluton missile. Initially 120 missiles were planned to be deployed.

A wheeled trailer and launcher, each carrying two missiles in containers, was planned for deploying the Hadès. The original design had a range of 350 km, which was later increased to 450 km. The guidance system was an inertial platform which could be programmed to execute evasive maneuvers before hitting the target. A version designed to hit hardened underground targets also had a final guidance system which used a GPS-based digital system, resulting in a Circular Error Probable of only 5 m, compared to a CEP of 100 m for the standard version.

== Development ==
Hadès began with project definition in 1975 as a replacement for the Pluton system. Development started in July 1984, and flight testing started in 1988. The Hadès program planned to build 120 missiles, some with nuclear and some with HE warheads. Hadès was originally designed with a range of 350 km, that would enable it to reach East Germany and Czechoslovakia if deployed from within France. The range requirement was later increased to 450 km. The missile was carried horizontally, erected by the truck itself, and launched immediately. The light weight of the missile made it easy to deploy even on difficult zones, and its great range made it usable for limited strategic aims, though not to destroy Soviet cities and missile silos.
In 1991, due to the changing situation in Europe and to the German opposition to the program (which was openly designed to strike East Germany), restrictions were decided upon so as not to deploy the system and limit the complement to 15 mobile launching platforms and 30 missiles.

The system entered service in 1992, as a resource kept in storage in case of a serious national threat, in north-eastern France near Lunéville. Reports in 1993 suggested that a reversion to the 250 km range missile, but with a hard target HE penetration warhead and a GPS mid-course updating of the inertial navigation system, would provide an accurate and difficult-to-counter offensive weapon. A TV digital scene matching terminal guidance system has also been proposed, providing a CEP down to less than 5m.

=== Deployment ===
Hadès was designed for transportation on wheeled TELs, with tractor and trailer, each trailer carrying two missiles in containers that also act as launch boxes. The missile is reported to be 7.5m long, with a body diameter of 0.53m and a launch weight of about 1850 kg.

Reports suggest that the Hadès trajectory is kept low, so that the aerodynamic control fins at the rear of the missile can alter the trajectory and range during flight as well as making evasive maneuvers during the terminal phase near the target.

=== Payload ===
The missiles would be capable of carrying either the nuclear TN 90 or conventional HE warheads, the former probably having a yield of 80 kt.

==Implementation==
The program completed development in 1992, with the first flight test taking place in 1988. It was planned that Hadès would enter service in 1992, and that only 30 missiles on 15 TEL vehicles would be built instead of the original plan to build 120 missiles. In 1991 the French Government announced that the Hadès missiles would not be deployed, but kept in storage, and the programme was terminated in 1992. However, 20 to 25 missiles were available in a national emergency with their mobile TEL vehicles, and were all located at Lunéville.

==Decommissioning==
On 23 February 1996 the announcement by Jacques Chirac, the President of France, on the new format for French nuclear forces called for dismantling of Hadès missiles. On 23 June 1997 the last of the Hadès missiles was destroyed.

<text>Joseph Bové, also Joseph Jean-Baptiste Charles de Beauvais or Osip Ivanovich Bove (; — ), was an Italian-Russian neoclassical architect who supervised the reconstruction of Moscow after the Fire of 1812.

==Biography==
Bové was born in St. Petersburg in the family of Vincenzo Giovanni Bova, a painter from Naples who settled in Russia in 1782. He had two younger brothers, Michaele and Alessandro, who also trained in architecture and later became his associates. Soon after Joseph&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Moscow. From 1802 to 1807, he studied architecture. Starting in 1807 he worked as an assistant to Matvei Kazakov and Carlo Rossi in Moscow and Tver. As a full-time employee of the Expedition, he was involved in various Kremlin maintenance jobs. In 1813, after the Fire of Moscow (1812) that razed most of the city, Bové was hired by the Moscow Building Commission and assigned to lead the &quot;Facade Department&quot;, responsible for the approval of new facade designs and for enforcing the placement of new buildings according to the new master plan&#x27;s street lines. The plan, however, was not finalized until 1817. Private builders were so numerous that Bové and the city failed to control them. Emperor Alexander, visiting Moscow, was enraged to see buildings painted in all kinds of colors, especially deep red and dark green, and issued a decree that limited the city palette to modest, pale colours.

While the Giliardi Family was rebuilding major public buildings like Moscow State University, Bové was in charge of designing and rebuilding the new Central Squares of Moscow and Red Square. His best known project, Theatre Square, was completed in 1825, however both Bolshoi Theater and Maly Theater were subsequently rebuilt, and the square lost its neoclassical symmetry. In fact, most of his buildings were demolished by accidents or real estate developers:

* Trade Rows in Red Square (1815), with a rotunda dome mirroring the dome of Kazakov&#x27;s Kremlin Senate, were demolished in the 1880s to make way for the larger Upper Trading Rows.
* Gagarin family mansion in Novinsky Boulevard was destroyed by an air raid in 1941.
* Triumphal Arch by Tverskaya Zastava (1827–1834) was demolished in 1938; a replica was built in the 1960s in Dorogomilovo District.
* Listed memorial building at Tverskoy Boulevard, 26 and nearby was razed by Konstantin Ernst&#x27;s development company in 2003-2005.

In 1824 and 1825, he participated in the reconstruction of Moscow Manege. He designed numerous private mansions in Moscow, but his most famous work remains the Bolshoi Theatre. Extant buildings include:

* The Intercession Church in Balashikha
* 37, Myasnitskaya Street
* Catherine&#x27;s Hospital in Strastnoy Boulevard
* Military school and barracks in Lefortovo District
* First City Hospital in present-day Leninsky Prospekt
* Two small mansions on the Garden Ring (15, Sadovo-Kudrinskaya)

* Church of St.Nicholas in Kotelniki by Joseph Bové (on Kotelnicheskaya Embankment)
* His last work, Church of Theotokos, &quot;Joy of all who Sorrow&quot; on Bolshaya Ordynka Street (1831–1836)

==Death==
Bové died in Moscow in 1834, aged 49, and was interred at the Donskoy monastery.

Gheorgheni historically formed part of the Székely Land region of Transylvania. It was first mentioned in 1332. It belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary with several interruptions, the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and the Principality of Transylvania, administratively the town belonged to Gyergyószék. Between 1867 and 1918 it fell within Csík County, in the Kingdom of Hungary. 

In the aftermath of World War I, the Union of Transylvania with Romania was declared in December 1918. At the start of the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1918–1919, the town passed under Romanian administration. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of the Kingdom of Romania and fell within Ciuc County. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary. Towards the end of World War II, Romanian and Soviet armies entered the town in October 1944. The territory of Northern Transylvania remained under Soviet military administration until March 9, 1945, after which it again became part of Romania. Between 1952 and 1960, Gheorgheni was part of the Magyar Autonomous Region, and between 1960 and 1968 part of the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. After the administrative reform of 1968, the region was abolished, and since then, the city has been part of Harghita County.

<text>The BMW M51 is an inline-6 cylinder Diesel engine produced by the Upper Austrian BMW plant in Steyr from July 1991 through February 2000. Its predecessor is the BMW M21, the successor is the BMW M57.

== Description ==

The M51 is a water-cooled and turbocharged inline six-cylinder diesel engine with a Bosch VP37-swirl-chamber-injection. The displacement is and the compression ratio is 22.0:1.

Some engine variants have an intercooler in addition to the turbocharger, they can be identified by the &quot;tds&quot;. The M51 is an engine made of cast iron, it has one chain driven overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder. Compared to the M21 the M51 now has tappets and a hydraulic valve lash adjustment. The fuel injection in the first engines and all E36 models is controlled by the ECU Bosch DDE 2.1, which was replaced after the first technical revision by the DDE 2.2 This results in greater torque at lower revs. For lubrication SAE 5W-40 oil is used.

<text>Elfriede Hildegard Mohneke (born 2 March 1922, Dorschen, East Prussia, Germany (present-day Dorsze, Ełk, Poland) – died 11 December 1994, Berlin, Germany) was a guard at two Nazi concentration camps in World War II.

On 12 October 1944, Mohneke arrived at Ravensbrück concentration camp to begin overseer training under Dorothea Binz. In November 1944, the SS sent her as an Aufseherin to the Uckermark camp down the road from Ravensbrück. Mohneke served in the camp until the Allied liberation in April 1945. 

At the third Ravensbrück Trial, the former SS woman was sentenced to ten years in prison for the maltreatment of concentration camp prisoners. In her appeal against the sentence, she claimed she was sent to Ravensbrück against her will by a mandatory call for duty from the labour office. She was released on 14 June 1952 for good conduct after serving only four years of her sentence. On 31 May 1968 she was questioned by Berlin police about another perpetrator that they were trying to trace.

<text>The following is a list of people executed by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]; which abolished the death penalty in 1847. The one person executed after 1847 was executed by the United States strictly within federal jurisdiction. Thus, it was &quot;not&quot; performed within the legal boundaries of Michigan &quot;as a matter of law&quot;.

== French and British colonial periods ==
== Under U.S. jurisdiction (Michigan Territory) ==
== Federal executions in Michigan ==

Only One person has been executed by the United States for a federal crime committed &quot;in&quot; Michigan. The execution was carried out at Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, in York Charter Township near the Village of Milan.
As a matter of jurisdictional law, this execution did not take place in Michigan &quot;per se&quot; because it was carried out by the United States government at a US government-owned facility, located in but not subject to the State of Michigan&#x27;s jurisdiction.

<text>The BMW M57 is a straight-6 diesel engine produced from 1998 up to 2013 in BMW&#x27;s Upper Austrian engine plant in Steyr.

== Description ==
The M57 is a water-cooled and turbocharged inline six cylinder diesel engine with common rail injection. It was revised twice during its production time. It is based on its predecessor M51. The block and the crankcase of the first M57 engines and the TÜ (&quot;Technische Überarbeitung&quot; = revision) engines are made of cast iron, whilst the TÜ2 engines are made of aluminium instead. The combustion chamber was also changed in the TÜ2. The injection pressure is in the non TÜ engine, whilst all other engines use a pressure of . For fuel injection, magnetic injectors are used, except from the TÜ2 OL and TOP engines, which make use of piezo injectors. The common-rail-system is made by Bosch and also controlled by a Bosch DDE 4 ECU for non TÜ and DDE 5 ECU for TÜ. All models are equipped with turbocharger and an intercooler. The 2.9L M57, which is found in E39 530d and E38 730d, as well as early models of E46 330d and E53 X5, is equipped with one Garrett GT2556V turbocharger. The 2.5L M57TÜ uses a Garrett GT2056V turbocharger, the 3.0L M57TÜ a Garrett GT2260V turbocharger, the M57TÜ2 a Garrett GTB2260VK turbocharger, whilst the M57D30TÜTOP sports a BorgWarner KP39 high-pressure and a K26 low-pressure turbocharger. The compression ratio reaches from 16.5:1 to 18.0:1, M57 engines with higher power output and more than one turbocharger have a lower compression ratio. Every cylinder has two inlet and two exhaust valves as well as two chain-driven overhead camshafts. The redline is 4750 rpm.

<text>Cowley Road is an arterial road in the city of Oxford, England, running southeast from near the city centre at The Plain near Magdalen Bridge, through the inner city area of East Oxford, and towards the industrial suburb of Cowley. 

It is a section of the B480 road, which runs between Oxford and Henley-on-Thames. Cowley Road forms a terminal section of the B480 where it ends at The Plain, and becomes Oxford Road where it crosses the Boundary Brook and Marsh Road, before Temple Cowley (also known as Cowley). As such, Cowley is an area of Oxford distinct to Cowley Road, which is so named because it approaches Cowley. They are, however, often mistakenly conflated. Oxford also has another distinct Cowley Road, in Littlemore. Cowley Road in Littlemore approaches Cowley from the South, while the B480 Cowley Road approaches it from the North East.

Cowley Road is also the main shopping street of East Oxford, and in the evenings it is the area&#x27;s main leisure district. The central shopping is at .

Cowley Road, like most of Oxford, has an ethnically and economically diverse population. This includes significant, long-standing South Asian and Afro-Caribbean communities, who have been joined more recently by East European, Chinese and African arrivals. Alongside these ethnic groups, East Oxford plays host to many members of the city&#x27;s academic population, both undergraduate and academic staff, and is home to many politically active groups.

Cowley Road has high levels of both road traffic and pedestrian traffic, and space for both is limited. In 2005, Oxfordshire County Council invested about £1,000,000 from central government to re-model the busiest part of Cowley Road. The carriageway has been realigned and colourfully resurfaced, the pavements have been repaved, cycle lanes have been enhanced in some places and removed from others and in one section the speed limit has been reduced to .

==Music and culture==
The Cowley Road area has played a prominent part in the Oxford music scene. A number of successful bands made their formative performances in local venues such as the O2 Academy Oxford (formerly known as The Zodiac), and The Bullingdon (formerly The Art Bar). A house party on the Cowley Road was the site to the UK band Foals&#x27; first ever gig. Famous Oxford bands have included Supergrass, Radiohead and Ride.

Cowley Road is also home to the Cowley Road Carnival, an annual event when the road is pedestrianised, and which features live music, static sound systems, a parade, and food from around the world. Cowley Road Carnival became an integral part of contemporary Oxford. Held on the first Sunday in July it celebrated the multicultural diversity of the city and regularly attracted around 50,000 visitors. The COVID-19 pandemic caused cancellation of the street carnival and in 2022 the organisers announced closure of the Carnival. After a 5 year break, the carnival returned in 2024, taking place on the 1st of September.

<doc id="1285524" wikidata="Q665728" url="?curid=1285524" title="LHCb experiment">
<text>The LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) experiment is a particle physics detector collecting data at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. LHCb specializes in the measurements of the parameters of CP violation in the interactions of b- and c-hadrons (heavy particles containing a bottom and charm quarks). Such studies can help to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. The detector is also able to perform measurements of production cross sections, exotic hadron spectroscopy, and electroweak physics in the forward region. The LHCb collaborators, who built, operate and analyse data from the experiment, are composed of approximately 1650 people from 98 scientific institutes, representing 22 countries. Vincenzo Vagnoni succeeded on July 1, 2023 as spokesperson for the collaboration from Chris Parkes (spokesperson 2020–2023). The experiment is located at point 8 on the LHC tunnel close to Ferney-Voltaire, France just over the border from Geneva. The (small) MoEDAL experiment shares the same cavern.

== Physics goals ==
The experiment has wide physics program covering many important aspects of heavy flavour (both beauty and charm), electroweak and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) physics. Six key measurements have been identified involving B mesons. These are described in a roadmap document that formed the core physics programme for the first high energy LHC running in 2010–2012. They include:
* Measuring the branching ratio of the rare Bs → μ+ μ− decay.
* Measuring the forward-backward asymmetry of the muon pair in the flavour-changing neutral current Bd → K* μ+ μ− decay. Such a flavour changing neutral current cannot occur at tree-level in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and only occurs through box and loop Feynman diagrams; properties of the decay can be strongly modified by new physics.
* Measuring the CP violating phase in the decay Bs → J/ψ φ, caused by interference between the decays with and without Bs oscillations. This phase is one of the CP observables with the smallest theoretical uncertainty in the Standard Model, and can be significantly modified by new physics.
* Measuring properties of radiative B decays, i.e. B meson decays with photons in the final states. Specifically, these are again flavour-changing neutral current decays.
* Tree-level determination of the unitarity triangle angle γ.
* Charmless charged two-body B decays.

== The LHCb detector ==
The fact that the two b-hadrons are predominantly produced in the same forward cone is exploited in the layout of the LHCb detector. The LHCb detector is a single arm forward spectrometer with a polar angular coverage from 10 to 300 milliradians (mrad) in the horizontal and 250 mrad in the vertical plane. The asymmetry between the horizontal and vertical plane is determined by a large dipole magnet with the main field component in the vertical direction.

=== Subsystems ===
The Vertex Locator (VELO) is built around the proton interaction region. It is used to measure the particle trajectories close to the interaction point in order to precisely separate primary and secondary vertices.

The detector operates at from the LHC beam. This implies an enormous flux of particles; VELO has been designed to withstand integrated fluences of more than 1014 p/cm2 per year for a period of about three years. The detector operates in vacuum and is cooled to approximately using a biphase CO2 system. The data of the VELO detector are amplified and read out by the Beetle ASIC.
The RICH-1 detector (Ring imaging Cherenkov detector) is located directly after the vertex detector. It is used for particle identification of low-momentum tracks.

The main tracking system is placed before and after the dipole magnet. It is used to reconstruct the trajectories of charged particles and to measure their momenta. The tracker consists of three subdetectors:

* The Tracker Turicensis, a silicon strip detector located before the LHCb dipole magnet
* The Outer Tracker. A straw-tube based detector located after the dipole magnet covering the outer part of the detector acceptance
* The Inner Tracker, silicon strip based detector located after the dipole magnet covering the inner part of the detector acceptance
Following the tracking system is RICH-2. It allows the identification of the particle type of high-momentum tracks.

The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters provide measurements of the energy of electrons, photons, and hadrons. These measurements are used at trigger level to identify the particles with large transverse momentum (high-Pt particles).

The muon system is used to identify and trigger on muons in the events.

=== LHCb upgrade (2019–2021) ===
At the end of 2018, the LHC was shut down for upgrades, with a restart currently planned for early 2022. For the LHCb detector, almost all subdetectors are to be modernised or replaced. It will get a fully new tracking system composed of a modernised vertex locator, upstream tracker (UT) and scintillator fibre tracker (SciFi). The RICH detectors will also be updated, as well as the whole detector electronics. However, the most important change is the switch to the fully software trigger of the experiment, which means that every recorded collision will be analysed by sophisticated software programmes without an intermediate hardware filtering step (which was found to be a bottleneck in the past).

== Results ==
During the 2011 proton-proton run, LHCb recorded an integrated luminosity of 1 fb−1 at a collision energy of 7 TeV. In 2012, about 2 fb−1 was collected at an energy of 8 TeV. During 2015–2018 (Run 2 of the LHC), about 6 fb−1 was collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. In addition, small samples were collected in proton-lead, lead-lead, and xenon-xenon collisions. The LHCb design also allowed the study of collisions of particle beams with a gas (helium or neon) injected inside the VELO volume, making it similar to a fixed-target experiment; this setup is usually referred to as &quot;SMOG&quot;. These datasets allow the collaboration to carry out the physics programme of precision Standard Model tests with many additional measurements. As of 2021, LHCb has published more than 500 scientific papers.

=== Hadron spectroscopy ===
LHCb is designed to study beauty and charm hadrons. In addition to precision studies of the known particles such as mysterious X(3872), a number of new hadrons have been discovered by the experiment. As of 2021, all four LHC experiments have discovered about 60 new hadrons in total, vast majority of which by LHCb. In 2015, analysis of the decay of bottom lambda baryons (Λ) in the LHCb experiment revealed the apparent existence of pentaquarks, in what was described as an &quot;accidental&quot; discovery. Other notable discoveries are those of the &quot;doubly charmed&quot; baryon formula_1 in 2017, being a first known baryon with two heavy quarks; and of the fully-charmed tetraquark formula_2 in 2020, made of two charm quarks and two charm antiquarks. 

=== CP violation and mixing ===
Studies of charge-parity (CP) violation in B-meson decays is the primary design goal of the LHCb experiment. As of 2021, LHCb measurements confirm with a remarkable precision the picture described by the CKM unitarity triangle. The angle formula_3 of the unitarity triangle is now known to about 4°, and is in agreement with indirect determinations.

In 2019, LHCb announced discovery of CP violation in decays of charm mesons. This is the first time CP violation is seen in decays of particles other than kaons or B mesons. The rate of the observed CP asymmetry is at the upper edge of existing theoretical predictions, which triggered some interest among particle theorists regarding possible impact of physics beyond the Standard Model.

In 2020, LHCb announced discovery of time-dependent CP violation in decays of Bs mesons. The oscillation frequency of Bs mesons to its antiparticle and vice versa was measured to a great precision in 2021.

=== Rare decays ===
Rare decays are the decay modes harshly suppressed in the Standard Model, which makes them sensitive to potential effects from yet unknown physics mechanisms.

In 2014, LHCb and CMS experiments published a joint paper in Nature announcing the discovery of the very rare decay formula_4, rate of which was found close to the Standard Model predictions. This measurement has harshly limited the possible parameter space of supersymmetry theories, which have predicted a large enhancement in rate. Since then, LHCb has published several papers with more precise measurements in this decay mode.

Anomalies were found in several rare decays of B mesons. The most famous example in the so-called formula_5 angular observable was found in the decay formula_6, where the deviation between the data and theoretical prediction has persisted for years. The decay rates of several rare decays also differ from the theoretical predictions, though the latter have sizeable uncertainties.

=== Lepton flavour universality ===
In the Standard Model, couplings of charged leptons (electron, muon and tau lepton) to the gauge bosons are expected to be identical, with the only difference emerging from the lepton masses. This postulate is referred to as &quot;lepton flavour universality&quot;. As a consequence, in decays of b hadrons, electrons and muons should be produced at similar rates, and the small difference due to the lepton masses is precisely calculable.

LHCb has found deviations from this predictions by comparing the rate of the decay formula_7 to that of formula_8, and in similar processes. However, as the decays in question are very rare, a larger dataset needs to be analysed in order to make definitive conclusions.

In March 2021, LHCb announced that the anomaly in lepton universality crossed the &quot;3 sigma&quot; statistical significance threshold, which translates to a p-value of 0.1%. The measured value of formula_9, where symbol formula_10 denotes probability of a given decay to happen, was found to be formula_11 while the Standard Model predicts it to be very close to unity. In December 2022 improved measurements discarded this anomaly.

In August 2023 joined searches in leptonic decays formula_12 by the LHCb and semileptonic decays formula_13 by Belle II (with formula_14) set new limits for universality violations.
=== Other measurements ===
LHCb has contributed to studies of quantum chromodynamics, electroweak physics, and provided cross-section measurements for astroparticle physics.

<text>Margarete Maria Rabe (born 2 October 1923) was a guard at two concentration camps from November 1944 until April 1945.

In 1944, Rabe applied to the Neustadt camp office at Neustadt-Glewe to be a guard, and was stationed at Ravensbrück concentration camp on 7 November 1944. She immediately began mistreating the female prisoners there, and was infamous in the camp for her brutality. In late November or early December 1944, Rabe was one of several guards to be posted to the Uckermark camp under Ruth Closius. There the young SS &quot;Aufseherin&quot; helped select women and children for the gas chambers, and also took part in murders and torture (one survivor commented that the SS women in Uckermark were the most brutal of any in the Ravensbrück complex). In April 1945, Rabe fled the Uckermark camp.

At the third Ravensbrück Trial in April 1948, the British court handed her a sentence of life imprisonment. It was estimated that she had selected 3,000 female prisoners for the gas chamber and other execution methods. Rabe was released from prison on 26 February 1954, having served five years and ten months in confinement.

<text>Youngblood is a superhero team starring in their self-titled comic book series, created by writer/artist Rob Liefeld. The team made its debut as a backup feature in &quot;RAMM&quot; #1 (May 1987) before the next month appearing in the one-shot &quot;Megaton Explosion&quot; #1 (June 1987) before later appearing in April 1992 in its own ongoing series as the flagship publication for Image Comics and the wider Image Universe. Youngblood was originally published by Image Comics, and later by Awesome Entertainment. Upon Rob Liefeld&#x27;s return to Image Comics, it was revived in 2008, 2012, and 2017. In 2019, Liefeld revealed that he has not owned the rights to &quot;Youngblood&quot; for several years.

In most of its iterations, Youngblood is a high-profile superteam sanctioned and overseen by the United States government. Youngblood&#x27;s members include Shaft, a former FBI agent who uses a high-tech bow; Badrock, a teenager transformed into a living block of stone; Vogue, a Russian fashion model with purple-and-chalk-white skin; and Chapel, a government assassin.

==Publication history==
===Creation of the series===
&quot;Youngblood&quot; was inspired by creator Rob Liefeld&#x27;s idea that if superheroes existed in real life, they would be treated as celebrities, much the same as movie stars and athletes. The series, therefore, depicts the superhero members of Youngblood not only as they participate in adventures fighting crime and evil, but navigating the world of celebrity endorsement deals, TV show appearances, agents, managers, and the perceived pressures of celebrity life.

From 1985 to 1987, Liefeld did pinups for Megaton Comics, including one of the character Ultragirl that would see print in &quot;RAMM&quot; #1 (May 1987) and &quot;Megaton Comics Explosion&quot; #1 (June 1987), a &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot;-type reference book featuring individual entries of characters in the style of an encyclopedia or handbook. This gave Liefeld an opportunity for his own creation, Youngblood, to see print in this form. The two-page entry featuring the team (consisting at that point of the characters Sentinel, Sonic, Brahma, Riptide, Cougar, Psi-Fire, and Photon) was the team&#x27;s first appearance in print.

Two months later, the team appeared in an advertisement in &quot;Megaton&quot; #8 (August 1987) indicating that it would next appear in &quot;Megaton Special&quot; #1 by Liefeld and writer Hank Kanalz, with a cover by artist Jerry Ordway. However, Megaton Comics went out of business before that comic was printed.

Liefeld has explained that the version of &quot;Youngblood&quot; that eventually saw print in &quot;Youngblood&quot; #1 was based partially on his 1991 plan for a new &quot;Teen Titans&quot; series for DC Comics to be co-written with Marv Wolfman. According to Liefeld, he and managing editor Dick Giordano failed to reach an agreement on the project, and Liefeld merged his &quot;Teen Titans&quot; ideas with his previous, creator-owned &quot;Youngblood&quot; property. According to Liefeld, &quot;Shaft was intended to be Speedy. Vogue was a new Harlequin design, Combat was a Kh&#x27;undian warrior circa the Legion of Super-Heroes, ditto for Photon and Die Hard was a S.T.A.R. Labs android. I forgot who Chapel was supposed to be, but I&#x27;m sure it would have rocked&quot;. Given the failed deal with DC and Liefeld&#x27;s increasingly strained relationship with Marvel Comics over his &quot;X-Force&quot; royalties, he joined other Marvel artists to form Image Comics in order to publish &quot;Youngblood&quot; in their own series.

===Original runs===

&quot;Youngblood&quot; #1 (April 1992) was an anthology consisting of two separate stories published in flip book format: each half of the book had its own front cover and contained one story, rotated upside-down from the other half. One story featured the organisation&#x27;s &quot;Home Team&quot;, for domestic missions, consisting of Shaft, Badrock (originally named Bedrock), Chapel, Die Hard, Photon and Vogue. The other story featured the &quot;Away Team&quot;, for international missions, consisting of Sentinel, Brahma, Combat, Cougar, Psi-Fire and Riptide.
A sneak preview of the series appeared in &quot;The Malibu Sun&quot; #1 (February 1992), published by Image through Malibu Comics, which provided administrative, production, distribution, and marketing support for Image&#x27;s early publications. On March 13, two separate 5½&quot; x 8½″ black-and-white ashcan editions of &quot;Youngblood&quot; began to surface, each featuring one of two separate stories from &quot;Youngblood&quot; #1. Edition &quot;A&quot; featured the 13-page lead story, while Edition &quot;B&quot; featured the other side of the flip book, along with four extra pages of art that would not be included in the premier issue. According to Image Comics spokesperson John Beck, the print run on edition &quot;A&quot; was 1,000 copies, and edition &quot;B&quot; was limited to 500 copies.

&quot;Youngblood&quot; #1 (April 1992) was the first Image Comics publication. At the time of its release, it was the highest selling independent comic book published, despite receiving poor reviews from critics for unclear storytelling due to both Liefeld&#x27;s art and the book&#x27;s flip format, which some readers found confusing; poor anatomy; incorrect perspective; non-existent backgrounds; poor dialogue; and the late shipping of the book, a problem that continued with subsequent issues. In an interview in &quot;Hero Illustrated&quot; #4 (October 1993), Liefeld conceded disappointment with the first four issues of &quot;Youngblood&quot;, calling the first issue a &quot;disaster&quot;. He explained that production problems, as well as sub-par scripting by his friend and collaborator Hank Kanalz, whose employment Liefeld later terminated, resulted in work that was lower in quality than that which Liefeld produced when Fabian Nicieza scripted his plots on &quot;X-Force&quot;, and that reprints of those four issues would be re-scripted. Writer and columnist Peter David pointed to Liefeld&#x27;s scapegoating of Kanalz as an example of Liefeld&#x27;s failure to take responsibility for his project, and evidence that genuine collaboration with good writers like Louise Simonson and Fabian Nicieza, which some of the Image founders did not appreciate, had previously reflected better on Liefeld&#x27;s art. Throughout its run at Image, &quot;Youngblood&quot; and other books published by Liefeld&#x27;s Extreme Studios were attacked by critics for late issues and inconsistent quality.

Although intended for monthly publication, issues #1–3, #0 and #4–5 of &quot;Youngblood&quot; were published intermittently between April 1992 and July 1993. Four months passed between the publication of issues #3 and #0, and five months between issues #4 and #5. Ultimately, &quot;Youngblood&quot; #5 was published in flip-book format with &quot;Brigade&quot; #4 as its flip-side; Liefeld was also replaced with Chap Yaep as penciller. Various other Image Comics series were spun off or previewed in these issues: issue #0 introduced the team leader of &quot;Brigade&quot;, the story arc in issues #2–5 introduced the main characters and central premise of &quot;Prophet&quot;, and a backup story in issue #3 introduced the series &quot;Supreme&quot;.

An anthology spin-off series &quot;Youngblood: Strikefile&quot; began publication in 1993, featuring stories spotlighting various individual main characters from &quot;Youngblood&quot;. Issues #1–3 (April – August 1993) were flip books, containing three-part stories starring Die Hard and Chapel; issue #4 (October 1993) contained a single self-contained story featuring Shaft, Badrock and Die Hard. A one-shot &quot;Youngblood Yearbook&quot; (July 1993) featuring the &quot;Away Team&quot; was also published, effectively as an annual.

Liefeld solicited writer Kurt Busiek for &quot;Youngblood&quot; stories in 1993. Busiek wrote detailed plots for three issues and ideas for a fourth, under the proposed title &quot;Youngblood: Year One&quot;. This was never produced, but the plot lines were revived amid controversy years later.

From September 1993 a new title was launched, &quot;Team Youngblood&quot;, published monthly, pencilled by Chap Yaep. It featured what was formerly termed the &quot;Away Team&quot; with an altered team lineup, consisting of Sentinel, Cougar, Riptide, Photon, and new characters Dutch (owned by Yaep) and Masada. This series effectively replaced the original &quot;Youngblood&quot; title; the characters Shaft and Badrock were limited to cameos, and Chapel was added to the cast of &quot;Bloodstrike&quot;. Issues #7–8 were included in the &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot; crossover event.

The original &quot;Youngblood&quot; series resumed in June 1994 from issue #6, now published monthly, and strongly integrated with &quot;Team Youngblood&quot;: plot developments and characters regularly crossed back and forth between the two titles. Old characters were brought back including Shaft, Badrock, Vogue, Combat and Brahma, while new ones were introduced including Knightsabre, Troll, and trainee recruits Task and Psilence. &quot;Youngblood&quot; issue #9 was an out-of-continuity story written and pencilled by Jim Valentino as part of &quot;Image X Month&quot;, where creators swapped titles. The original volume of &quot;Youngblood&quot; ended with issue #10 in December 1994, having been delayed. &quot;Youngblood: Strikefile&quot; also resumed publication in July 1994 from issue #5, now also published monthly; it ended with issue #11.

The January 1995 crossover event &quot;Extreme Sacrifice&quot; incorporated &quot;Team Youngblood&quot; #17 as &quot;Part 6 of 8&quot;, and afterward included &quot;Youngblood: Strikefile&quot; #11 (February 1995) as &quot;Part 0 of 8&quot; for its main story featuring Chapel. &quot;Team Youngblood&quot; then ran for issues #18–20 (May – July 1995), ahead of a relaunch of the &quot;Youngblood&quot; title with a new issue #1 (September 1995).

The second &quot;Youngblood&quot; volume included many crossovers with other comics published by Image. Issue #3 (November 1995) crossed over with &quot;Glory&quot; in a two-part story. The January 1996 nine-part crossover event &quot;Extreme Destroyer&quot; included &quot;Youngblood&quot; #4. The &quot;Rage of Angels&quot; (March 1996) crossover included &quot;Youngblood&quot; #6 and also issue #21 of a revived &quot;Team Youngblood&quot;; the &quot;ShadowHunt&quot; crossover (April 1996) included &quot;Youngblood&quot; #7 and &quot;Team Youngblood&quot; #22, the latter series&#x27; final issue. Following issue #10, &quot;Youngblood&quot; crossed over with the Marvel Comics series &quot;X-Force&quot; (also created by Liefeld) in one of the several inter-company crossover one-shot stories Image Comics would do with Marvel over the course of the 1990s; the two-part story consisted of issues titled &quot;Youngblood/X-Force&quot; (July 1996) and &quot;X-Force/Youngblood&quot; (August 1996).

In September 1996, Liefeld had a falling out with his Image partners, forcing him to leave the company. Liefeld retained the creative rights to &quot;Youngblood&quot;; however, the series was put on hiatus. In December 1996, &quot;Youngblood&quot; #14 was published by Liefeld&#x27;s company Maximum Press – its story picked up directly after #10, and no issues #11-13 were ever published. The ongoing story arc was intended to conclude with an issue #15, which was solicited but never released.

===Alan Moore===
In 1997, Liefeld hired Alan Moore to relaunch and revamp &quot;Youngblood&quot;. Moore&#x27;s run on the title began with a mini-series entitled &quot;Judgment Day&quot;, which revolved around the mysterious murder of Youngblood member Riptide, the subsequent &quot;super-trial&quot; of teammate Knightsabre, and the all-powerful &quot;Book of All Stories&quot; which dictates the order of the universe.

Moore created a new, teenaged Youngblood group that was financed independently by millionaire Waxey Doyle, formerly the WWII superhero Waxman. The team was led by Shaft and was augmented by new members Big Brother, Doc Rocket, Twilight, Suprema, and Johnny Panic. Moore said he wanted Youngblood to be a &quot;less sprawling, more dynamic team&quot; and that &quot;if you have more characters than [six], the action gets cluttered and it becomes increasingly difficult to establish each character as a real and solid person in their own right&quot;. All of the new team members and most of the villains featured in this series, including Jack-A-Dandy, were Moore&#x27;s creations.

However, despite Moore&#x27;s plans for at least 12 issues of his new &quot;Youngblood&quot;, only three issues were ever printed, and the third issue was published in another book called &quot;Awesome Adventures&quot;. The team also appeared in a short story in the &quot;Awesome Christmas Special&quot; where Shaft&#x27;s journal provides the narration as the new team comes together.

Moore&#x27;s rough outline for the series was published in &quot;Alan Moore&#x27;s Awesome Handbook&quot; and included a budding relationship between Big Brother and Suprema, a giant planet-devouring entity called &quot;The Goat&quot;, Shaft&#x27;s fruitless crush on Twilight, and the revelation that Johnny Panic was the biological son of Supreme villain Darius Dax. In the &quot;Handbook&quot;, Moore also reveals that he intentionally chose the team members for their connections to various points and significant characters in the Awesome Universe&#x27;s superhero history, noting this as the case in the 1980s launch of &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;.

===&quot;Youngblood: Genesis&quot;===
In 2000, Liefeld began soliciting orders for &quot;Youngblood: Genesis&quot;, using Kurt Busiek&#x27;s unused &quot;Year One&quot; plots. Busiek asked that he only be credited with providing the plots for this new series. He was listed as plotter on the comic book itself when it came out years later, but when Liefeld advertised the comic through Diamond Previews &quot;as written by Kurt Busiek&quot;, Busiek accused him of not honoring their agreement and eventually asked that his fans not buy the series.

&quot;Youngblood: Genesis&quot; officially ended after two issues, as the third and fourth issues would have used Image Comics characters for which Liefeld did not have the appropriate permissions. According to Liefeld: &quot;I have the original issues #3 and #4 that Kurt wrote, [but] they can&#x27;t be produced as is simply from the standpoint that they heavily feature prominent supporting cast members from &quot;Spawn&quot; and &quot;Wildcats&quot;, as well as Lynch from &quot;Gen13&quot; and &quot;Team 7&quot;&quot;.

===2004–present===
A number of projects were announced in 2003 including reprinting older material and providing the art for two &quot;Youngblood&quot; series. The two new comic books involved Mark Millar writing new issues of &quot;Youngblood: Bloodsport&quot; and &quot;Youngblood: Genesis&quot; written by Brandon Thomas. However, only one issue of the &quot;Youngblood: Bloodsport&quot; was published, but in June 2008, Liefeld announced that issue #2 would appear in September.

In 2004, Robert Kirkman began writing a new series, &quot;Youngblood: Imperial&quot;, with artist Marat Mychaels but left after one issue due to his busy schedule. Fabian Nicieza was slated to take over.

In 2005, Liefeld announced that Joe Casey would be re-assembling and re-scripting the original &quot;Youngblood&quot; mini-series into a more coherent and sophisticated story to be titled &quot;Maximum Youngblood&quot;. On July 12, 2007, it was announced that Liefeld would return to Image Comics to publish a collected &quot;definitive version&quot; of &quot;Maximum Youngblood&quot; with a new ending written by Joe Casey, illustrated by Liefeld himself. This was followed in January 2008 by a new ongoing series (&quot;Youngblood&quot; Volume 4) written by Casey and illustrated by Derec Donovan, with covers by Liefeld. Liefeld was slated to begin writing and art duties on Youngblood beginning in May 2009. No new issues have come out since then, with &quot;Youngblood&quot; Volume 4 ending with only nine issues and issue #9 focusing only on the backup stories plot.

In late 2011, it was announced that screenwriter John McLaughlin would write a revival of &quot;Youngblood&quot; with artist Jon Malin and series creator Rob Liefeld for a May 2012 release, starting with &quot;Youngblood&quot; #71, as the series reverts to its original legacy numbering. The series ran for 8 issues, concluding with #78 in July 2013.

For the 25th anniversary of both Youngblood and Image Comics, in May 2017 a new ongoing series (&quot;Youngblood&quot; Volume 5) was launched, written by Chad Bowers with art by Jim Towe. It lasted 11 issues, a 12th issue was solicited but never published.

In August 2019, Liefeld revealed that he has not owned the rights of &quot;Youngblood&quot; since the late 1990s, and that they are currently owned by Andrew Rev of Terrific Production LLC.

In October 2024, it was announced Liefeld would be returning to write and illustrate a new &quot;YoungBlood&quot; series beginning in 2025. It was also revealed that Liefled would reunite with Scott Mitchell Rosenberg for more &quot;YoungBlood&quot; related projects including &quot;a &quot;Youngblood Vault Edition&quot; representing high resolution scans of the original art from the first &quot;Youngblood&quot; series in a deluxe oversized hardcover, as well as a Facsimile Edition of &quot;Youngblood #1&quot; to mark the title’s 33rd anniversary in April 2025, both to be published by Image Comics.&quot;

==Fictional team history==
In the 1980s, American politician Alexander Graves created Youngblood as a team of genetically-enhanced superpowered humans with the intention to forge the team into his own personal weapon—Graves was later revealed to be Lucifer.

Youngblood&#x27;s members include Shaft, Badrock, Vogue, and Chapel.

==Reaction and impact==
As &quot;Youngblood&quot; #1 is the comic book that introduced Image Comics, it is ranked #19 on Comic Book Resources&#x27;s 2008 chronological list of the 20 Most Significant Comics. According to CBR&#x27;s Steven Grant, this status is derived not so much from the comic&#x27;s content, but for triggering both the 1990s speculator boom and bust and the trend towards the creation of superhero universes among various publishers. The series, and the formation of Image itself, is credited with discouraging publishers&#x27; emphasis on their creative talent in their marketing decisions.

==In other media==
A half-hour &quot;Youngblood&quot; animated series was planned for the 1995–96 season on Fox as part of an hour block with a proposed &quot;Cyberforce&quot; series. The series was being developed by Roustabout Productions, a newly formed animation company. According to Nick Dubois, creative director and co-founder of Roustabout, the series would take a lighthearted approach with tongue-in-cheek humor. A clip was created but the series was never produced. The clip aired in commercials for Youngblood action figures.

A &quot;Youngblood&quot; video game, an isometric action game similar to &quot;&quot; but incorporating RPG elements such as experience points and character stats, was in development by Realtime Associates for the PlayStation and PC in 1997, with GT Interactive as the publisher. It was never released.

In 2009, Reliance Entertainment acquired the feature film rights to the comic book, reportedly for a mid-six figures, with Brett Ratner attached to direct.

==Collected editions==
A number of the comic books have been collected into trade paperbacks:
* &quot;Youngblood&quot; TPB (collects &quot;Youngblood&quot; Volume 1, #1–4; 96 pages; 1993 &quot;Previews&quot; Exclusive Edition)

<doc id="1285543" wikidata="Q13006" url="?curid=1285543" title="Tossa de Mar">
<text>Tossa de Mar (; Spanish: Tosa de Mar) is a municipality in Catalonia, Spain, located on the coastal Costa Brava, about 100 kilometres north of Barcelona and 100 kilometres south of the French border. It is accessible through Girona Airport, some distance north.

The GR 92 long-distance footpath, which roughly follows the length of the Mediterranean coast of Spain, has a staging point at Tossa de Mar. Stage 10 links northwards to Sant Feliu de Guíxols, a distance of , whilst stage 11 links southwards to Lloret de Mar, a distance of .

==History==

There is ample evidence of settlements dating back to the Neolithic period, and it is believed that the area has been continuously populated since that time. Between the 4th-1st century BC the first Iberian settlements appeared, followed shortly after by the Romans in the 1st century.

In 966, Tossa was ceded by Count Miró of Barcelona to the Abbey of Ripoll. Some two centuries later, in 1187, Tossa was granted its charter by the Abbot of Ripoll, coinciding with the building of a church atop Mount Guardí, the remnants of which can still be seen today.

Sometime in the 12th century, the medieval town was walled off and a castle was built on the highest point of Mt. Guardí, this castle was to be subsequently replaced by a windmill, and this in turn by a lighthouse which is still operational.

By the year 1500, the first houses were built &quot;extra-muros&quot; to accommodate population growth. This process was greatly accelerated during the 17th and 18th centuries, shaping an urban configuration that was to remain practically unchanged until the arrival of mass tourism in the 1950s.

In 1989, Tossa de Mar was the first place in the world to declare itself an anti-bullfighting city.

==Economy==

Contrary to popular belief that Tossa has traditionally been a fishing town, in medieval times and until the arrival of tourism, the local economy was mostly based on agricultural production, principally grapes and cork. There was a thriving export market of the latter (in the form of cork taps shipped to the Americas) during the 18th century and early 19th century.

Fishing has traditionally been a relatively minor contributor to the village&#x27;s economy, although it has consistently provided an alternative source of income in times of economic crisis. A small fishing industry is still active as of 2005 and occupies a few members of local fishing families. Most of their captures are sold to local restaurants and in the fish markets in neighbouring Blanes and Sant Feliu de Guíxols.

==Beaches==
Tossa de Mar has three main beaches:
*The Tossa Beach (Platja Gran), in front of downtown. This beach is enclosed to the west by the medieval castle. It is 380m long and 60m wide.
*La Mar Menuda, on the other side of the bay. It has all the usual services and facilities, such as sports equipment hire. Local police patrol the area on bicycles. Dimensions of the beach: 180m long and 20m wide.
*El Codolar, behind the walls.

==The Ancient Hospital of Sant Miquel==
This ancient hospital was founded in 1773 as a hospital for the poor. The founder, Tomás Vidal i Rey had become wealthy in America. It is a building with two floors and a central courtyard. It now houses the cultural centre of the village. At its side is the chapel of Sant Miquel with a baroque altar of some note.

==Roman villa of Ametllers==
This rural villa (1st century BC - 6th century AD) belonged to the Roman province of Tarraconensis. It consists of two parts: the rural and the rustic. One can get an idea of its great value by looking, among other things, at the remains of the spa, the central heating system, the mosaics, and the base of a fruit press with the recipient for the crushed juices. Fragments of the mosaics, the stucco, and several elements of sculptures attest to the wealth of the owners of the villa. The ceramic vases are proof of the trade with the Mediterranean world. Farming tools, fish tackle, and loom tools reveal agricultural and fishing activities. Everyday life is evoked by other objects such as hairpins, small spoons, and bone and ivory utensils.

==Parish church==

This church, dedicated to the martyr Vincent of Saragossa, was inaugurated on 29 November 1775, after 20 years of construction. The church is one of the largest in the diocese and can, during important celebrations, host the whole population of Tossa de Mar. Much of the interior of the church was devastated during the Civil War in 1936.

Inside is the chapel of Saint Sebastian, a saint adored by the population. The devotion started in the 15th or 16th century and culminates each year on 20 January into the commemoration of &quot;Vot del Poble&quot; (pledge of the people). The retable of the Rosary has also survived the destruction in 1936.

==The walled-in Old Town==

The &quot;Vila Vella enceinte&quot; is the only example of a fortified medieval town still standing on the Catalan coast. Its present appearance dates back to the end of the 14th century. It still has the entire original perimeter with battlemented stone walls, four turrets, and three cylindrical towers with parapets. At the highest point, where the lighthouse stands today, was, until the beginning of the 19th century, the castle of the Abbot of the Monastery &quot;Santa Maria de Ripoll&quot;, the territorial Lord of the town. The site was declared a national historic monument in 1931.

The interior of the Old Town is a charming place with narrow, cobblestoned streets, the Governor&#x27;s House (now the Municipal museum), the House of Holy Cloth (&quot;Sant Drap&quot;), a medieval hospital, and remnants of a Romanesque church and a Gothic church.

==Municipal museum==
The Municipal Museum, built in Late Gothic style, is situated in the Governor&#x27;s House, inside the &quot;Vila Vella enceinte&quot;. It used to be the residence of the jurisdictional governors of Tossa de Mar and its environs, who ruled for the Abbots of the monastery &quot;Santa Maria de Ripoll&quot;.

The museum was opened on 1 September 1935. It houses an important collection of contemporary art with works of Spanish and foreign artists who frequented Tossa de Mar during the 1930s, such as the &quot;Celestial Violinist&quot; by Marc Chagall. The archaeological section houses artefacts dating from the Paleolithical Period to the Late Middle Ages. Of particular note are the mosaics found in the atrium of the Roman Villa of the Ametllers, dating from the end of the 4th - beginning of the 5th century.

Associated with the artists were the Scottish journalist Archie Johnstone and his Anglo-Irish writer wife Nancy Johnstone who established a hotel in the old town in 1934, the &quot;Casa Johnstone&quot;. The building still exists, although it now forms part of a larger hotel complex, the Hotel Don Juan. At the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Johnstones turned the hotel over to use by refugee children who, shortly before Tossa fell to the Nationalists, the Johnstones piled 70 children into a truck, and drove them to safety in France, being chased throughout by Franco&#x27;s troops. Nancy wrote two memoirs recording their experiences in Tossa de Mar: &quot;Hotel in Spain&quot;, describing their ups and downs between 1934 and 1936, as they set up the hotel, and &quot;Hotel in Flight&quot; describing the war years, 1936-1939.

<text>A rules lawyer is a term used to describe a participant in a rules-based environment who attempts to use the letter of the law without reference to the spirit, usually in order to gain an advantage within that environment. The term is commonly used in wargaming and tabletop role-playing game communities, often pejoratively, as the &quot;rules lawyer&quot; is seen as an impediment to moving the game forward. The habit of players to argue in a legal fashion over rule implementation was noted early on in the history of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Rules lawyers are one of the &quot;player styles&quot; covered in &quot;Dungeon Master for Dummies&quot;. The rules of the game &quot;Munchkin&quot; include various parodies of rules lawyer behavior.

<doc id="1285549" wikidata="Q711045" url="?curid=1285549" title="Nikolai Vasilyevich Repnin">
<text>Prince Nikolai or Nicholas Vasilyevich Repnin (; – ) was a Russian statesman and general from the Repnin princely family who played a key role in the dissolution of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth; the leading figure in the Repnin Sejm, the victor at Maçin.

== Rule of Poland ==
Born in Saint Petersburg, Prince Repnin served in the Imperial Army under his father, Prince Vasily Anikitovich Repnin, during the Rhine Campaign of 1748, and subsequently resided for some time abroad, where he acquired &quot;a thoroughly sound German education.&quot; He also participated, in a subordinate capacity, in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

In 1763, Emperor Peter III sent him to Prussia as ambassador. The same year, Catherine transferred him to Poland as minister plenipotentiary; in Warsaw he was rumored to have had an affair with Izabela Fleming (and to have fathered Adam Jerzy Czartoryski).

Due to the level of Russian control of the Polish government, Repnin was the effective ruler of the country, with special instructions to form a pro-Russian faction from among the various Protestants, who were to receive equal rights with the Catholics. Repnin believed that the Protestants were not significant enough to benefit Russia; at the same time, the Protestant community itself petitioned Empress Catherine, requesting not to be involved.

In order to further Russian interests, he encouraged the creation of two Protestant &quot;confederations&quot; (of Sluck and Toruń) and later, a Catholic one (the Radom Confederation, led by Karol Stanisław &quot;Panie Kochanku&quot; Radziwiłł). According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;, Repnin&#x27;s correspondence reveals that he disliked the type of politics he was required to engage in. Nevertheless, he obeyed his instructions, and used various means to force the 1767–68 Sejm (the &quot;Repnin Sejm&quot;) to concede all points in dispute. Before the Sejm, he ordered the capture and exile to Kaluga of some vocal opponents of his policies — Józef Andrzej Załuski and Wacław Rzewuski. The immediate result was the formation of the Bar Confederation, which practically demolished the ambassador&#x27;s strategy.

== Military career ==
Repnin resigned his post to lead troops against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War. At the head of an independent command in Moldavia and Wallachia, he prevented a large Ottoman army from crossing the Pruth (1770), distinguished himself at the actions of Larga and Kagul, and captured Izmail and Kilia. In 1771 he received the supreme command in Wallachia and occupied Bucharest. A quarrel with the commander-in-chief, Rumyantsev, then induced him to send in his resignation, but in 1774 he participated in the capture of Silistria and in the negotiations which led to the peace of Kuchuk-Kainarji. In 1775-76 Repnin and his factotum, Yakov Bulgakov, represented Russian interests at the Porte.

On the outbreak of the War of the Bavarian Succession he led 30,000 men to Breslau, and at the subsequent congress of Teschen, where he was Russian plenipotentiary, compelled Austria to make peace with Prussia.

During the second Turkish war (1787-92) Repnin was, after Alexander Suvorov, the most successful of the Russian commanders. He defeated the Ottomans at Salcia, captured the whole camp of the &quot;seraskier&quot;, Cenaze Hasan Pasha, shut him up in Izmail, and was preparing to reduce the place when he was forbidden to do so because of his indecisiveness at the siege (1789). After another unsuccessful siege by Pavel Potemkin, Samoylov, and de Ribas, Suvorov, appointed by Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin, stormed Izmail. On the retirement of Potemkin in 1791, Repnin succeeded him as commander-in-chief, and immediately routed the grand vizier at Măcin, a victory which compelled the Ottomans to accept the truce of Galaţi (31 July 1791).

== Declining years ==
After the Second Partition of Poland, he was made governor-general of the newly acquired Lithuanian provinces, where he also commanded the Russian forces during the Kościuszko Uprising. Tsar Paul I raised him to the rank of field marshal (1796), and in 1798 sent him on a diplomatic mission to Berlin and Vienna to detach Prussia from France and unite the Habsburg monarchy and Prussia against the First French Republic. Unsuccessful, upon his return he was dismissed from service and died in Riga.

Repnin had an illegitimate son, Ivan Pnin, and it was widely rumored that Adam Jerzy Czartoryski was the fruit of a liaison between Repnin and Izabela Fleming. Repnin&#x27;s legitimate children were three daughters. Upon his death, as the male Repnin line became extinct, Alexander I permitted Repnin&#x27;s grandson prince Nikolai Repnin-Volkonsky to assume the Repnin name and his grandfather&#x27;s coat-of-arms.

<doc id="1285552" wikidata="Q6851953" url="?curid=1285552" title="Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill">
<text>The Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill was a private member&#x27;s bill introduced into the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by Tam Dalyell under the Ten Minute Rule. It received its formal first reading on 26 January 1999. The bill sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to Parliament. The long title of the bill was &quot;A Bill to require the prior approval, by a simple majority of the House of Commons, of military action by United Kingdom forces against Iraq&quot;. It was presented by Tam Dalyell and supported by Tony Benn, Harry Cohen, Jeremy Corbyn, George Galloway, Neil Gerrard, Ian Gibson, John McAllion, Alice Mahon, Robert Marshall-Andrews, Dennis Skinner and Audrey Wise.

The bill became Bill 35 in the 1998/1999 parliamentary session, and was initially scheduled for second reading on 16 April 1999. As a bill modifying the monarch&#x27;s prerogative powers, Queen&#x27;s Consent was required before it could be debated in Parliament. The Queen, acting upon the advice of her government, refused to grant her consent for the bill to be debated. The second reading was initially postponed from 16 April until 23 July 1999. Due to the Crown&#x27;s continuing refusal to signify its consent to the bill being debated, it could not receive its second reading on 23 July 1999. In the absence of a request for a further postponement, the bill was automatically dropped before it obtained its second reading.

When military action against Iraq was eventually organised in 2003, the government sought parliamentary approval on 18 March 2003, one day before the invasion began, although no powers under the royal prerogative were thereby transferred to Parliament.

<doc id="1285558" wikidata="Q580027" url="?curid=1285558" title="Gara Garayev">
<text>Gara Abulfaz oghlu Garayev (February 5, 1918May 13, 1982) was a prominent Soviet Azerbaijani composer. Garayev wrote nearly 110 musical pieces, including ballets, operas, symphonic and chamber pieces, solos for piano, cantatas, songs, and marches, and rose to prominence not only in the Azerbaijan SSR, but also in the rest of the Soviet Union and worldwide.

==Early life==
Garayev was born into a family of pediatricians, which was famous in Baku. His mother, Sona, was among the first graduates of the Baku-based school of the Russian Music Society. Garayev&#x27;s younger brother, Mursal, became a surgeon and Doctor of Medicine.

In 1926, at the age of eight, Gara Garayev first entered the junior music school at the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire, currently known as the Baku Music Academy. Due to his musical talents, Garayev was allowed to enroll simultaneously in two faculties at the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire in 1933. Among his teachers were , , and Uzeyir Hajibeyov. In 1937, Garayev joined the Union of Composers of Azerbaijan SSR.

==Career==
In 1938, at the age of twenty, Garayev composed his first musical piece, a cantata &quot;The Song of the Heart&quot; to the poem by Rasul Rza. It was performed in Moscow&#x27;s Bolshoi Theater in the presence of Joseph Stalin in the same year. Garayev conducted his cantata during the Decade of Azerbaijani Art festival in the Bolshoi Theater, an event also attended by Stalin. In the same year, Garayev moved to the Moscow State Conservatoire, where he became a student and a good friend of Dmitri Shostakovich.

In 1941 Garayev returned to Baku to teach at Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Society. In 1945, both he and Jovdat Hajiyev wrote the &quot;Motherland&quot; (&quot;Vətən&quot;) opera, for which they were awarded a prestigious Stalin Prize. In 1948, at the age of 30, Garayev was again awarded this prize for his symphonic poem &quot;Leyli and Majnun&quot;, based on the same-titled famous work of Nizami Ganjavi. Upon the death of Uzeyir Hajibeyov in 1948, Garayev became the Chair of the Union of Composers of Azerbaijan SSR and the rector of the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire. In this latter position, Garayev retained Uzeyir Hajibeyov&#x27;s traditional emphasis on Azerbaijani folk music in teaching, and also promoted contemporary genres, such as jazz in Azerbaijani music. In 1948 Garayev also became the delegate to the First National USSR Congress of Soviet Composers. In the same year Garayev also headed the Music Department at the Azerbaijan Architecture and Art Institute.

In 1952, under the direction of the choreographer P. A. Gusev, Garayev&#x27;s &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; ballet was staged at the Azerbaijani Theater of Opera and Ballet. Based on Nizami Ganjavi&#x27;s famous poem, &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; (&quot;Yeddi gözəl&quot;) opened a new chapter in the history of classical music of Azerbaijan. Garayev&#x27;s only other ballet, &quot;Path of Thunder&quot; (&quot;İldırımlı yollarla&quot;), staged in 1958, was dedicated to racial conflicts in South Africa. In the same year, Garayev also wrote the score for the documentary film &quot;A Story About the Oil Workers of the Caspian Sea&quot;, directed by Roman Karmen and set at the Oil Rocks.

During his teaching career at the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire, Garayev tutored a number of prominent Azerbaijani musicians and composers, including Galib Mammadov, Arif Malikov, Khayyam Mirzazade and among others. Garayev&#x27;s son, Faraj (born 1943), also became his student and went on to compose single-act ballets such as &quot;Shadows of Qobustan&quot; (&quot;Qobustanın kölgələri&quot;) and &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, and later led the musical avant-garde movement in Azerbaijan.

During the Cold War in June 1961, Garayev and Tikhon Khrennikov were the only two Soviet composers who attended the first International Los Angeles Music Festival held at UCLA. The festival programmed works by fifteen composers from around the world, including Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky. On June 11, Franz Waxman conducted the Festival Symphony Orchestra with a suite from Garayev&#x27;s &quot;Path of Thunder&quot;.

In 1962 Garayev became a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and visited the United States, Ethiopia, and Lebanon. In 1972 he visited Poland.

==Later life==

Garayev suffered from heart disease, which prevented him from attending his own 60th jubilee celebration held in Baku, where he was awarded the title of the Hero of Socialist Labor. Garayev spent the last five years of his life in Moscow, away from the public, although his love for Baku remained strong and was reflected in his writing:
Garayev died on May 13, 1982, in Moscow at the age of 64. His body was flown to Baku and buried at the Alley of Honor.

<doc id="1285567" wikidata="Q1166896" url="?curid=1285567" title="Darwin (lunar crater)">
<text>Darwin is a lunar impact crater of the type categorised as a walled plain. It lies in the southeastern part of the Moon, and is sufficiently close to the limb to appear significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth. Attached to its southern rim is Lamarck. To the northeast is the dark-floored crater Crüger.

The outer rim of this formation has been significantly disintegrated by the nearby impacts. The southern and northern parts of the rim in particular are all but destroyed. The eastern rim is somewhat worn but intact, and several small craters lie along the southwestern rim. The satellite crater Darwin B, a fairly large formation with a diameter of 56 kilometers, is attached to the outer western rim.

Parts of the interior floor of Darwin have been resurfaced. The southern floor of Darwin is only roughly level, with irregular surface features and several small craters. There is a dune-like set of hills in the northeast part of the floor, which is &quot;decelerated surface-flow ejecta&quot; from the Orientale basin impact that struck the eastern rim. In the western floor is a large, low, somewhat irregular dome, one of the few such features not found on a mare. There is also the remnant of a small crater at the southern end of the floor.

A system of rilles cut across the northern part of the floor, crossing the eastern rim and continuing to the southeast. These rilles are designated the Rimae Darwin, and they stretch for a distance of about 280 kilometers. To the east of Darwin, this system of rilles crosses Rima Sirsalis, a wide rille that follows a line to the northeast.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Darwin.

<doc id="1285569" wikidata="Q1182511" url="?curid=1285569" title="De-escalation">
<text>De-escalation refers to the methods and actions taken to decrease the severity of a conflict, whether of physical, verbal or another nature. It is the opposite of escalation. De-escalation may also refer to approaches in conflict resolution, by which specific measures are taken to avoid behaviours that escalate conflict. De-escalation can be modelled with game theory. 

== Psychology ==
=== Verbal de-escalation in psychiatric settings ===
In psychiatric settings, de-escalation is aimed at calmly communicating with an agitated client in order to understand, manage, and resolve their concerns. Ultimately, these actions are intended to reduce the client&#x27;s agitation and potential for present or future aggression or violence. An insufficient or overdue intervention may leave staff needing to use coercive measures to manage an aggressive or violent client. Coercive measures, such as chemical or mechanical restraints, or seclusion, are damaging to the therapeutic relationship and harmful to clients and staff.

As of 2016, there are 19 articles in literature that define or provide a model of de-escalation. Articles converge on a number of themes (i.e. de-escalation should involve safely, calmly, and empathetically supporting the client with their concerns).

Hankin et al.’s (2011) review of four de-escalation studies reflects the somewhat unclear state of de-escalation research. Their review settles on eight goals, seven elements, 15 general techniques, and 15 other techniques divided into three subheadings.

Price &amp; Baker (2012) identify seven themes across relevant papers: three related to staff skills (e.g. empathetic concern, calm appearance and gentle tone of voice) and four related to the process of intervention (e.g. establishing rapport, maintaining safety, problem solving and setting limits).

The available literature provides clinical descriptions of effective de-escalation based on qualitative data and professional observations. However, these thematic analyses need to be supported by more objective data; one hallmark of such objectivity would be an empirical scale or quantitative measure of de-escalation.

=== De-Escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale (DABS) ===
An English modified version of the De-Escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale (DABS) identifies seven qualities necessary for de-escalation:
* Valuing the client: Provides genuine acknowledgement that the client&#x27;s concerns are valid, important and will be addressed in a meaningful way.
* Reducing fear: Listens actively to the client and offers genuine empathy while suggesting that the client&#x27;s situation has the potential for positive future change.
* Inquiring about client&#x27;s queries and anxiety: Can communicate a thorough understanding of the client&#x27;s concerns, and works to uncover the root of the issue.
* Providing guidance to the client: Suggests multiple ways to help the client with their current concerns and recommends preventive measures.
* Working out possible agreements: Takes responsibility for the client&#x27;s care and concludes the encounter with an agreed-upon short-term solution and a long-term action plan.
* Remaining calm: Maintains a calm tone of voice and steady pace that is appropriate to the client&#x27;s feelings and behaviour.
* Risk taking: Maintains a moderate distance from the client to ensure safety, but does not appear guarded and fearful.
== Law enforcement ==
=== United States ===

Starting around 2015, after facing criticism after numerous high-profile killings of civilians by police officers, some police forces in the US adopted de-escalation training, designed to reduce the risk of confrontations turning violent or deadly for anyone involved.

The FIRST STEP Act prison reform bill, passed under the Trump administration, mandates de-escalation training, especially for &quot;incidents that involve the unique needs of individuals who have a mental illness or cognitive deficit.&quot;

==== Need for de-escalation practices in law enforcement ====
Richards (2007) states that de-escalation is the act of moving from a state of high tension to a state of reduced tension. Bell (2018) points out that the reason there is heightened tension in law enforcement today than ever before is due to technology. Media reports on the use of force, racial unrest, riots and injustice make it seem like conflicts between police and citizens are happening every day. Bell notes that because people can so readily view these conflicts between police and citizens through technology, people have become resistant to or challenging of law enforcement. In response, the police have had to become engaged in social media, ethics training, diversity training and de-escalation programs.

Bell notes that police are different from average citizens. He states that citizens have a “duty to retreat&quot; while trained officers are expected to pursue and make arrests if need be. Sometimes officers have some discretion in how they will handle a situation such as when an encounter has the potential to become violent. It is at these times that “officers can turn to de-escalation tactics and still complete their mission to protect and serve.” Oliva &quot;et al.&quot; note, “As the role of police officers continues to expand from exclusively crime fighting to encompass other service-oriented functions, they must be able to recognize the characteristics of individuals in crisis in order to provide an effective and helpful resolution to the situation while reducing liability and risk of injury” (p. 16.) Hence the need for de-escalation tactics on the part of law enforcement officers.

==== Types of de-escalation practices ====
De-escalation tactics predominantly revolved around securing the scene at hand and attempting to calmly communicate with the citizen involved. Andrew Bell describes several de-escalation practices to assist in a potentially violent situation:
* The Tactical Pause entails stepping back, pausing to allow everyone involved a brief moment to think, perhaps ending or limiting a fight-or-flight response.
* The Just-Be-Nice Tactic where the police officer speaks and gives commands in a friendly tone regardless of how the citizen is conducting themselves. Bell notes that there are occasions when the situation is not, in fact, what it appears to be, and the citizen is not committing a crime or violation. The Just-Be-Nice Tactic is particularly helpful in such cases.
* Be Aware, Understand, then React. Police need to avoid getting caught up in the moment so should take a moment to be aware, assess and understand what is going on around them before they react.
Oliva &quot;et al.&quot; suggest the following basic de-escalation techniques: securing the scene, remove distractions or disruptive people from the area. Further, &quot;The officer should remain calm and speak slowly, in short sentences, to encourage communication. The responding officer should also present a genuine willingness to understand and help&quot;. Oliva &quot;et al.&quot; go on to outline the following specific de-escalation techniques: 
* Effective Communication so that the officer and individual can understand each other.
* Active Listening Skills such as reflecting statements like &quot;I understand that makes you angry&quot;. Use of minimal encouragers-brief responses, like saying &#x27;OK,&#x27; that let the person know the officer is listening. Introducing oneself using &quot;I&quot; statements restating statements the individual says mirroring/reflecting or summarizing/paraphrasing.
* Use of Open-Ended/Closed-Ended Questions.
Oliva &quot;et al.&quot; also note behaviours that officers should avoid when attempting to de-escalate a situation which include: Not asking “why” questions as it makes the person defensive, they shouldn&#x27;t rush the person, never speak too loudly, they should keep their feelings from interfering, they shouldn&#x27;t challenge a person if they are having delusions or hallucinations but neither should they agree they are real.

==== Memphis Model ====
One of the most prominent de-escalation programs was developed by The Memphis Crisis Intervention Team or CIT. This program, which has come to be known as the Memphis Model, provides law enforcement with crisis intervention training to particularly help those with mental illness. This program is aimed at diverting those in a mental health crisis from ending up in jail. The goal of the program is to improve the safety of officers, family members and people in the community and to direct people with mental illness away from the judicial system and into the healthcare system. Through this program, officers are given 40 hours of comprehensive training that includes de-escalation techniques. Officers engage in role-playing various scenarios as part of this program.

According to The Memphis Crisis Intervention Team, research on the efficacy of CIT shows that it helps officers feel more confident, increases jail diversion for those with mental illness, increases the likelihood that those with mental illness get treatment, and injury to officers is significantly reduced. Compton et al. (2008) conducted a comprehensive review of the existing research on the effectiveness of the Memphis Model of the Crisis Intervention Team. While research is limited, the authors note that there is preliminary support that the Memphis Model may be helpful in connecting those with mental illness to the psychiatric services that they need. The authors further note that police officers knowledge and confidence improve with such training. Arrest rates also appear to be lower by officers trained in the CIT model.

According to PBS, the Memphis Model has expanded to approximately 3,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. However, there are shortcomings to the research done on the effectiveness of the CIT programs such as lack of control groups and small sample sizes. The CIT programs around the country seem limited to addressing instituting de-escalation interventions with the mentally ill and not with the broader range of offenders that law enforcement officers may encounter. Furthermore, not all officers are trained in CIT; only self-selected police officers participate in this specialized training.

==== Simulation-based De-escalation Training ====
Traditional deescalation training relies on a combination of direct instruction (e.g., lectures, presentations, webinars), group discussion, and live &quot;peer role-play&quot; among class participants. The experiential aspect of role-play (both simulated and with live peers) has been found to be especially important for helping trainees develop core de-escalation skills and be able to deploy those skills in high-pressure situations. Accordingly, in 2023 U.S. Senators introduced S. 2637, to fund the development and distribution of a federal law enforcement training program that uses &quot;live-action simulations and role playing to place law enforcement personnel in an interactive learning environment to replicate real-life scenarios or teach particular skills or techniques.&quot; Those skills and techniques must include situational awareness, critical decision-making and problem-solving, crisis intervention, and de-escalation.

Work in other fields (especially healthcare) has drawn into question the value of live peer role-play, over other options for interactive training. Researchers have found that this is because the live peer role-play experience can vary so greatly with the quality of the training facilitator and acting skills of one&#x27;s partner in role-play exercises. Participants reported that peer role-play is generally inferior to other role-play options that are aimed at greater consistency and authenticity. This has led an increasing number of agencies and organizations in healthcare and law enforcement to adopt simulation-based de-escalation training over peer roleplay. Simulation-based training ensures a consistent and engaging experience for all trainees.

Simulation-based training follows many of the basic de-escalation approaches noted above (e.g. effective communication and assessment of the scene) but is done through screen-based or head-mounted virtual reality simulator. Notable simulation-based de-escalation training systems include FAAC&#x27;s MILO Range System (a screen-based simulator) and Apex Officer&#x27;s Virtual Reality Training (a head-mounted VR simulator). These training systems address a range of de-escalation situations not limited just to work with the mentally ill. 

Screen-based simulators have been in use in law enforcement training for since the 1990s. While early systems were rudimentary and focused on a single domain (like marksmanship or pursuit driving), by the early 2000s they&#x27;d expanded to include de-escalation and other soft skills. 

Today, screen-based simulators are generally understood to offer the broadest range of training options. They can run either computer-generated simulations, or those filmed in high-definition video using live actors. These simulations can be used for marksmanship (including live fire ), use-of-force, driving, or de-escalation/interaction/communication training by single officers, groups of officers, or teams of officers and non-law enforcement personal (such as social workers). 

Head-mounted virtual reality systems like Apex Officer&#x27;s Virtual Reality Training (introduced to the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) at their 126th Annual Conference and Exposition in Chicago, Illinois in October 2019.) are more limited in their offerings. Despite being more immersive according to some studies, the reliance on lower-fidelity computer-generated environments and characters make such systems better suited to single-person training on decision-making and de-escalation.

== International relations ==
In the military, de-escalation is a way to prevent military conflict escalation. A historic example is the teaching harvested from the Proud Prophet war simulation of a conflict between the US and the USSR, which took place in 1983. In war-time diplomacy, de-escalation is used as an exit strategy, sometimes called an &quot;off-ramp&quot; or &quot;slip road&quot;. In such cases, an alternative peaceful resolution is offered to a belligerent (i.e. nation or person engaged in war or conflict) in order to avoid further bloodshed. Restraint or appeasement against interventionism can in some cases lead to escalation instead of de-escalation. Deterrence is one strategy to decrease conflict severity. In asymmetric conflicts a probabilistic escalation might be rational for one side in some situations, resulting in challenges for de-escalation. &quot;De-escalation through escalation&quot; strategy hopes for increased probability of a diplomatic deal or further de-escalation.

<doc id="1285571" wikidata="Q5206047" url="?curid=1285571" title="DRE voting machine">
<text>A DRE voting machine, or direct-recording electronic voting machine, records votes by means of a ballot display provided with mechanical or electro-optical components that can be activated by the voter. These are typically buttons or a touchscreen; and they process data using a computer program to record voting data and ballot images in memory components. After the election, it produces a tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as printed copy. The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location. The device started to be massively used in 1996 in Brazil where 100% of the elections voting system is carried out using machines.

In 2004, 28.9% of the registered voters in the United States used some type of direct recording electronic voting system, up from 7.7% in 1996.

==History==

The idea of voting by push button with electrical technology used to total the votes dates back to the 19th century when Frank Wood of Boston was granted a patent on a direct-recording electrical voting machine. (Thomas Edison&#x27;s electrical voting system patent is sometimes cited in this regard, but it was intended for tallying roll-call votes in legislative chambers; as such, it is more like an audience response system.) The idea of electrical voting was pursued with much more vigor in the 20th century. Numerous patents were filed in the 1960s, many of them by AVM Corporation (the former Automatic Voting Machine Corporation), the company that had a near monopoly on mechanical voting machine at the time.

The first direct-recording electronic voting machine to be used in a government election was the Video Voter. This was developed by the Frank Thornber Company in Chicago. The Video Voter saw its first trial use in 1974 near Chicago, Illinois, and remained in use until 1980.

Microvote and Shoup Voting Machine Corporation entered the market in the mid 1980s with the MV-464 and the Shouptronic. Both of these machines saw widespread use; over 11,000 Shouptronic machines had been sold by 1993. In the years that followed, the rights to the Shouptronic were transferred to Guardian Voting and then to Danaher Controls, which sold it as the ELECTronic 1242.
==Benefits==

DREs prevent overvotes and provide immediate feedback to the voter about undervotes. They avoid ballots with ambiguous marks where voter intent can be unclear.

Like electronic ballot markers, DREs can be programmed to offer ballots in multiple languages, and they let people with disabilities vote without assistance, which would remove the anonymity of their vote. The machines can use headphones and other adaptive technology to provide accessibility. 

Additionally, with DRE voting systems there is no risk of exhausting the supply of paper ballots, and they remove the need for printing paper ballots, which cost $0.10 to $0.55 per ballot, though some versions print results on thermal paper, which has ongoing costs.
==Issues==
Skepticism about the integrity of DRE voting machines led to the creation of election forensics, which can help identify election fraud. 

===Delays in voting===
DREs can cause more delay than paper ballots at busy times, since every voter needs access to a machine. Queuing theory calculates that waits of an hour result from known variations in when voters arrive, number of voters per machine, and average time a voter spends with a machine. 

===Errors===
Issues have included public web access to the software, before it is loaded into machines for each election, and programming errors which increment different candidates than voters select.

===2009 German court ruling===
In 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany found that with voting machines the &quot;determination of the result must be able to be examined by the citizen reliably and without any specialist knowledge of the subject.&quot; They further found the DRE-type voting machines, used in parliamentary elections under current German law, permitted voting machines but were unconstitutional without further qualification. The decision does not ban electronic voting but implements a higher standard.

===Demonstrated laboratory attacks===
* Diebold Election Systems AccuVote-TS (Manipulation of the votes by the Princeton University)
* Nedap ES3B (Manipulation of the votes by a citizen group)
* SDU voting computers (Violating the secrecy of the ballot using Van Eck phreaking, tested by the Dutch secret service AIVD)

Attacks have also been performed on both DRE machines and optical scan voting machines, which count paper ballots. (See California study, &quot;Security Analysis of the Diebold AccuBasic Interpreter&quot;).

Whether it is a DRE or an optical scan machine, the opportunity for tampering applies to persons with inside access (including government workers) and to a lesser extent, outside hackers. Therefore, framing election tampering issues as &quot;hacking&quot; may not be an accurate framework for public concerns. Within the context of protecting voting rights, it would not matter whether vote alteration was done by an outsider or an insider. What is of most importance is the ability to perform an audit with a record generated and verified by the voter at the time their vote is cast, all of which is lost with the sole use of these DRE systems.

<text>Goffredo Petrassi (16 July 1904 – 3 March 2003) was an Italian composer of modern classical music, conductor, and teacher. He is considered one of the most influential Italian composers of the twentieth century.

==Life==
Petrassi was born at Zagarolo, near Rome. At the age of 15 he began to work at a music shop to supply his family&#x27;s financial needs, and became fascinated by music. In 1928, he entered the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome to study organ and composition for five years under Vincenzo di Donato. In 1933, composer Alfredo Casella conducted Petrassi&#x27;s &quot;Partita&quot; for orchestra at the ISCM festival in Amsterdam.

From 1940 to 1960 Petrassi was professor of composition at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory; later, he also became musical director of the opera house La Fenice, and from 1960 to 1978 he taught in the master courses in composition at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia. He was also a teacher at the Salzburg Mozarteum. Petrassi had many famous students, including Franco Donatoni, Aldo Clementi, Cornelius Cardew, Ennio Morricone, Karl Korte, Boris Porena, Norma Beecroft, Mario Bertoncini, Ernesto Rubin de Cervin, Eric Salzman, Kenneth Leighton, Peter Maxwell Davies, Michael Dellaira, Armando Santiago, and Richard Teitelbaum. Petrassi died in Rome at the age of 98.

==Music==
Petrassi&#x27;s early work was part of an attempt by several Italian composers to create a national &quot;Italian&quot; revival in classical music, corresponding to the romantic work of Germans such as Richard Wagner. During this time, his work was characteristically neoclassical in style, influenced by Bartók, Hindemith and Stravinsky.

In later years, Petrassi&#x27;s open musical mind and acute personality led him to experiment with different post-Webernian influences and a wide range of poetic materials, from Latin hymns to Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;La follia d&#x27;Orlando&quot; and &quot;Ritratto di Don Chisciotte&quot; (&quot;Portrait of Don Quixote&quot;), based on the Miguel de Cervantes literary character. All these influences are present in a remarkable series of eight Concerti for Orchestra which he composed between 1934 and 1972. His music appears on the CD labels Chandos, Stradivarius, Naxos, and Capriccio.

Petrassi stopped composing in 1986 due to progressive loss of eyesight.

<text>Focas is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just past the southwestern limb. In this location the crater is occasionally brought into view due to libration, but not much detail can be seen because the crater is viewed from the side.

The crater is situated in the wide valley between the ring-shaped Montes Rook in the north and Montes Cordillera range in the south. These ranges form a double-ring around the Mare Orientale impact basin. The crater is located toward the southern end of this immense feature, just to the north of the Montes Cordillera range. Focas is a relatively isolated crater, with the nearest craters of note being the Wright–Shaler crater pair some distance to the east along the same interior edge of the Montes Cordillera.

This is a circular crater with an interior floor about half the total diameter. It is symmetrical in form, with only some slight appearance of wear along the rim. The interior floor contains no features or impacts of note.

Focas Crater is named after Jean-Henri Focas (1909-1969), a Greco-French astronomer.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Focas.

<doc id="1285591" wikidata="Q3087334" url="?curid=1285591" title="Freedom of Information Act 2000">
<text>The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (c. 36) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that creates a public right of access to information held by public authorities. It is the implementation of freedom of information legislation in the United Kingdom on a national level. Its application is limited in Scotland (which has its own freedom of information legislation) to UK Government offices located in Scotland. The Act implements a manifesto commitment of the Labour Party in the 1997 general election, developed by David Clark as a 1997 White Paper. The final version of the Act was criticised by freedom of information campaigners as a diluted form of what had been proposed in the White Paper. The full provisions of the act came into force on 1 January 2005. 
The Act was the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department (now renamed the Ministry of Justice). However, freedom of information policy is now the responsibility of the Cabinet Office. The Act led to the renaming of the Data Protection Commissioner (set up to administer the Data Protection Act 1998), who is now known as the Information Commissioner. The Office of the Information Commissioner oversees the operation of the Act.

A second freedom of information law is in existence in the UK, the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (asp 13). It was passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2002, to cover public bodies over which the Holyrood parliament, rather than Westminster, has jurisdiction. For these institutions, it fulfils the same purpose as the 2000 Act.

Around 120,000 requests were made in the first year that the Act was in force. Private citizens made 60% of them, with businesses and journalists accounting for 20% and 10% respectively. However, requests from journalists tended to be more complex, and, consequently, more expensive. They accounted for around 10% of initial FoI requests made to central government, but 20% of the costs of officials&#x27; time in dealing with the requests. The Act cost £35.5 million in 2005.

==Background==
The act implements what was a manifesto commitment of the Labour Party in the 1997 general election. Before its introduction, there had been no right of access to government by the general public, merely a limited voluntary framework for sharing information.

===The white paper===
The act was preceded by a 1998 white paper, &quot;Your Right to Know&quot;, by David Clark. The White paper was met with widespread enthusiasm, and was described at the time as being &quot;almost too good to be true&quot; by one advocate of freedom of information legislation. The final act was substantially more limited in scope than the initial white paper.

===Parliamentary debate===
A draft Bill was published in May 1999; the Bill was extensively debated in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and received royal assent in November 2000.

==How the FOIA of 2000 Affected Access to Public Records==
The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) modernised the UK Public Records Act of 1958. This act gave the public a general right to access all types of recorded information held by public authorities, much greater than was previously allowed. The FOIA was mainly concerned with the management and preservation of public records.
=== Access To More Recent Records ===
The FOIA reduced the 30-year rule to a 20-year rule, meaning records would be made public earlier. This gave the public the ability to access more recent records without sacrificing national security or personal privacy.

=== Creation of the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office ===
A significant part of the FOIA was the establishment of the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO). This office oversees the upholding of information rights in the public interest, as well as making sure the FOIA is adhered to properly. If you think a public body is intentionally not giving you the information you&#x27;ve asked for, the ICO is the agency to contact. They are essentially the centralized management agency for all things public records. 

=== Real Time Reporting ===
While there was still a waiting period for the public to access records, the FOIA also established a system of real time reporting of records to the National Archives which could be accessed by all UK government agencies. 

=== Digitisation of Public Records ===
This is also when public records began to become digitised which also meant that the time frame for accessing records was immediate or real-time. This is an ongoing process that started with the advent of the digital age of the 21st century and is today a common practice for all UK public records.

==Act==

===Applicability===
The Freedom of Information Act creates a statutory right for access to information in relation to bodies that exercise functions of a public nature. Three different kinds of bodies are covered under the act: Public Authorities, publicly owned companies and designated bodies performing public functions.

====Public authorities====
In principle, the freedom of information act applies to all &quot;public authorities&quot; within the United Kingdom. A full list of &quot;public authorities&quot; for the purposes of the act is included in Schedule 1. Government departments, the Houses of Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Welsh Assembly, the armed forces, local government bodies, National Health Service bodies, schools, colleges and universities, police authorities and Chief Officers of Police are included within this list, which ranges from the Farm Animal Welfare Council to the Youth Council for Northern Ireland. A few government departments are expressly excluded from the scope of the act, principally intelligence services.

As government departments are created or closed, the act must be continually updated. Schedule 4 of the Act empowers the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs to add a body or officeholder to Schedule 1 as a public authority if they are created statute or prerogative; and its members are appointed by the government.

=====Hybrid public authorities=====
It is important to note that for some public authorities listed under Schedule 1, the act has limited effect. For example, the BBC is subject to the act only for information which is not held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature, to prevent its journalistic activities from possible compromise. The scope of this provision was considered in the 2007 High Court decision of &quot;BBC v Sugar&quot;, an internal BBC document examining the BBC coverage of the Middle East for potential bias. The appellants in that case argued that the document had been produced for both operational and journalistic reasons, and so should not be covered by the partial exemption provided in the act. The High Court rejected this argument; Mr Justice Irwin considered that the meaning of journalism within the act meant that any information held for such purposes was covered by the exemption:

My conclusion is that the words in the Schedule mean the BBC has no obligation to disclose information which they hold to any significant extent for the purposes of journalism, art or literature, whether or not the information is also held for other purposes. The words do not mean that the information is disclosable if it is held for purposes distinct from journalism, art or literature, whilst it is also held to any significant extent for those listed purposes. If the information is held for mixed purposes, including to any significant extent the purposes listed in the Schedule or one of them, then the information is not disclosable.

A 4:1 majority (Lord Wilson dissenting) of the Supreme Court upheld this decision, stating that the disclosure of any information held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature was to be excluded - even if the information was predominantly held for other purposes.

====Publicly owned companies====
Companies that fall within the definition of a publicly owned company under s6 of the Act automatically fall within its grasp. S6 provides that a company is publicly owned if:

: (a) it is wholly owned by the Crown, or
: (b) it is wholly owned by any public authority listed in Schedule 1 other than
:: (i) a government department, or
:: (ii) any authority which is listed only in relation to particular information.

====Designated bodies====
Under Section 5 of the Act, the Secretary of State may designate further bodies as public authorities under the Act, provided that those bodies are exercising a function of a public nature or contracting to provide a service whose provision is a function of a public authority. The first order under section 5 (in November 2011) extended the list of public authorities to also include the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Financial Ombudsman Service and UCAS.

===Right of Access===
The act creates a general right of access, on request, to information held by public authorities. On receipt of a freedom of information claim a public authority has two corresponding duties. First, a duty to inform a member of the public whether or not it holds the information requested (s1(1)(a)), and second, if it does hold that information, to communicate it to the person making that request (s1(1)(b)). As the corollary to this, the Act thus grants the equivalent rights to a confirmation or denial and communication of relevant information to an individual making a request under the act. The basic duty is supplemented by an additional duty to aid individuals in making requests and ensuring that they frame their FOI requests appropriately. (s.16(1))

However, there are numerous exemptions. Some of these are absolute bars to disclosure; some are qualified, which means the public authority has to decide whether the public interest in disclosing the relevant information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption. An applicant for information who considers that a request has been wrongly rejected may apply to the Information Commissioner, who has the power to order disclosure. However, such orders can be appealed to a specialist tribunal (the Information Tribunal) and in some circumstances, the Government has the power to override orders of the Information Commissioner.

Any person can request information under the act; this includes legal entities such as companies. There is no special format for a request. Applicants do not need to mention the Act when making a request. Applicants do not have to give a reason for their request.

===Exemptions===
Although the Act covers a wide range of government information, the act contains a variety of provisions that provide for the exemption from disclosure of certain types of information. The act contains two forms of exemption: &quot;absolute&quot; exemptions that are not subject to any public interest assessment, they act as absolute bars to the disclosure of information; and &quot;qualified&quot; exemptions where a public interest test must be made, balancing the public interest in maintaining the exemption against the public interest in disclosing the information. The original Freedom of Information White Paper proposed 15 such exemptions, but the final Bill included 24, and not all of the initial 15 were included.

====Absolute exemptions====
Exemptions designated &quot;absolute exemptions&quot; have no public interest test attached. The act contains eight such exemptions:

* Information that is accessible by other means (s.21)
* Information belonging to security services (s.23)
* Information contained in court records (s.32)
* Where disclosure of the information would infringe parliamentary privilege (s.34)
* Information held by the House of Commons or the House of Lords, where disclosure would prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs (s.36). (Information that is not held by the Commons or Lords falling under s.36 is subject to the public interest test)
* Information which (a) the applicant could obtain under the Data Protection Act 1998; or (b) where release would breach the data protection principles. (s.40)
* Information provided in confidence (s.41)
* When disclosing the information is prohibited by an enactment; incompatible with a European Union obligation; or would commit a contempt of court (s.44)

====Qualified exemptions====
If information falls within a qualified exemption, it must be subject to a public interest test. Thus, a decision on the application of a qualified exemption operates in two stages. First, a public authority must determine whether or not the information is covered by an exemption and then, even if it is covered, the authority must disclose the information unless the application of a public interest test indicated that the public interest favours non-disclosure. Qualified exemptions can be subdivided into two further categories: class-based exemptions covering information in particular classes, and harm-based exemptions covering situations where disclosure of information would be liable to cause harm.

====Class-based exemptions====
* Information intended for future publication (s.22)
* Information which does not fall within s. 23(1) is exempt if required for the purpose of safeguarding national security (s.24)
* Information held for purposes of investigations and proceedings conducted by public authorities (s.30)
* Information relating to the formation of government policy, ministerial communications, advice from government legal officers, and the operation of any ministerial private office (s.35)
* Information that relates to communications with members of the Royal family, and conferring honours (s.37)
* Prevents overlap between FoI Act and regulations requiring disclosure of environmental information (s.39)
* Information covered by professional legal privilege (s.42)
* Trade secrets (s.43(1))

====Harm-based exemptions====
Under these exemptions the exemption applies (subject to the public interest test) if complying with the duty under s.1 would, or would be likely to:
* Prejudice defence or the capability, effectiveness or security of any relevant forces (s.26)
* Prejudice international relations (s.27)
* Prejudice relations between any administration in the United Kingdom and any other such administration (s.28)
* Prejudice the economic interests of the UK (s.29)
* Prejudice law enforcement (e.g., prevention of crime or administration of justice, etc.) (s.31)
* Prejudice the auditing functions of any public authorities (s.33)
* In the reasonable opinion of a qualified person: prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs; prejudice collective responsibility, or inhibit the free and frank provision of advice or exchange of views (s.36)
* Endanger physical or mental health, or endanger the safety of the individual (s.38)
* Prejudice commercial interests (s.43(2)).

===Refusing requests===

====Vexatious requests====
A public authority is not obliged to comply with a request for information if the request is vexatious (s14(1)). A request is considered vexatious if it is &#x27;obsessive or manifestly unreasonable&#x27;, harasses the authority or causes distress to its staff, imposes a significant burden, or if the request lacks any serious value.

===Implementing the act===
The Act affects over 100,000 public bodies including government departments, schools and councils. The Act came into force in phases, with the final &quot;general right of access&quot; to public information under the Act coming into force on 1 January 2005. As well as the &quot;general right of access&quot;, the Act places a duty on public authorities to adopt and maintain pro-active &quot;publication schemes&quot; for the routine release of important information (such as annual reports and accounts). These publication schemes must be approved by the Information Commissioner. In general, public authorities have 20 working days to respond to an information request, though this deadline can be extended in certain cases and/or with the agreement of the requester. Under the Act, public authorities are encouraged to enter into a dialogue with the requester to better determine the information they want, and the format they want it in - in itself, a change in the way UK authorities interact with the public. Requests can be refused if they cost more than £600, including time spent searching for files. The UK Government established the Access to Information Central Clearing House in order to ensure consistency across Central Government in the way requests are handled.

===Contrasts with freedom of information law in other jurisdictions===
Three aspects of the UK&#x27;s Freedom of Information Act differ from the position in many other countries:

* Requests by individuals for access to their own personal information are dealt with outside the act for most practical purposes. They are dealt with under the Data Protection Act 2018 once it has been determined that the exemption for first party personal data is engaged, although some key provisions remain applicable e.g. the right of complaint to the Information Commissioner.
* Requests for information about matters concerning the environment are dealt with by the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. Those regulations, while similar to the FOIA, do differ in a number of ways.
* There is no procedure whereby third parties can challenge a decision by a public authority to disclose information: for instance, if a commercial organisation provides information to a public authority, and the authority discloses that information in response to an FOI Act request, the commercial organisation has no right of appeal against that decision. By contrast, &quot;reverse FOI&quot; applications of this type are common in the U.S.

==Reception==
At the time of the passing of the Act, advocates of freedom of information legislation were critical of the bill for its complexity, limited scope and the inclusion of a ministerial veto. Lord Mackay criticised the bill in the House of Lords as &quot;toothless&quot; for its inclusion of provisions allowing ministers to veto applications.

By contrast, Tony Blair, the prime minister responsible for passing the Act regards it as &quot;One of the biggest mistakes of his career&quot;. Blair says that &quot;For political leaders, it&#x27;s like saying to someone who is hitting you over the head with a stick, &#x27;Hey, try this instead&#x27;, and handing them a mallet. The information is neither sought because the journalist is curious to know, nor given to bestow knowledge on &#x27;the people&#x27;. It&#x27;s used as a weapon.&quot; Labour peer Lord Falconer has criticised the use of the act by journalists for &quot;fishing expeditions&quot; into salacious stories, arguing that &quot;FoI is not for press[,] it is for the people. It needs to be properly used in order to promote good Government. Information needs to be handled responsibly, and I strongly believe that there is a duty of responsibility on behalf of the media as well.&quot;

In the article &quot;Freedom of Information: A sheep in wolf&#x27;s clothing?&quot; Rodney Austin offers the following criticisms of the substance of the Act:

* The range of exemptions is wider than for any other freedom of information act existing in a democratic state.
* The obligations to establish publication schemes were diluted meaning that there is no duty to publish information of any specified type.
* There is a ministerial veto which undermines the Act. This has been used five times: the first time to stop publication of minutes of cabinet meetings relating to the invasion of Iraq, the second and third time by successive governments to stop publication of cabinet meetings relating to discussions regarding devolution, the fourth to stop publication of a risk register on NHS overhaul in England, and the fifth to stop publication of private letters of Charles III, then the Prince of Wales, sent to a number of government departments.

The legislation has also been criticised for &quot;loopholes&quot; that allow authorities to avoid disclosing information in certain situations. Companies owned by one public authority are generally subject to the Act but companies owned by two or more public authorities are not covered.

==Facts revealed by the act==
Facts that have been brought to light by this Act include:

*The Government agreed to a £1.5 million bailout of one of the most troubled schools in its flagship academies programme ten days before the 2005 general election.
*Ministers and MPs claimed thousands of pounds on taxis as part of £5.9 million in expenses for travel.
*Foreign diplomats – who have diplomatic immunity – were accused of rapes, sexual assaults, child abuse and murders while working in Britain.
*Seventy-four police officers serving with the Metropolitan Police have criminal records.
*A clandestine British torture programme existed in post-war Germany, &quot;reminiscent of the concentration camps&quot;.
*The UK supported the Israeli nuclear weapons program, by selling Israel 20 tonnes of heavy water in 1958.
*The NHS has made available Implanon implants to girls from the age of 13 in an attempt to cut teenage pregnancies.

=== Data breaches ===
* On 8 August 2023, the Police Service of Northern Ireland inadvertently responded to a FoI request made using WhatDoTheyKnow by supplementing the source data used to answer the request, which included the personal details of all police officers and staff on the force.

==Amendment bill==

The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill was a private member&#x27;s bill introduced to the British House of Commons in 2007 which failed to become law. Conservative MP David Maclean introduced the bill to ensure that MPs&#x27; correspondence was exempt from freedom of information laws. The then leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell, said there should not &quot;be one law for MPs and a different law for everyone else&quot; and that the Bill might make it appear as though &quot;Parliament has something to hide&quot;. However, this failed to pass the first reading in the House of Lords.

Further to this, Lord Falconer made comments suggesting that time spent deciding whether or not information fell under an exemption clause should be included in the £600 cost limit. Consultation was carried out, with the government saying the change would cut costs and discourage requests for trivial information, although critics said that it was to keep embarrassing information secret.

<doc id="1285604" wikidata="Q243005" url="?curid=1285604" title="Jean Peters">
<text>Elizabeth Jean Peters (October 15, 1926 – October 13, 2000) was an American film actress. She was known as a star of 20th Century Fox in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and as the second wife of Howard Hughes. Although possibly best remembered for her siren role in &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; (1953), Peters was known for her resistance to being turned into a sex symbol. She preferred to play unglamorous, down-to-earth women.

Late in her career, and after her retirement, Peters occasionally played roles in TV productions, appearing in four from 1973 to 1988.

==Early life==
Peters was born on October 15, 1926, in East Canton, Ohio, the eldest daughter of Elizabeth Thomas (née Diesel; 1898–1987) and Gerald Peters (1900–1937), a laundry manager. She had a younger sister, Shirley Peters (born 1935). Raised on a small farm in East Canton, Peters attended East Canton High School. She was a Methodist. She went to college at the University of Michigan and later transferred to Ohio State University, where she studied to become a teacher and majored in literature.
While studying for a teaching degree at Ohio State, she entered and won the Miss Ohio State Pageant in the fall of 1945, besting 11 other finalists. Sponsored by photographer Paul Robinson, she was awarded the grand prize of a screen test with 20th Century-Fox.

==Career==
===20th Century Fox===
As her agent, Robinson accompanied Peters to Hollywood, and helped her secure a seven-year contract with Fox. She dropped out of college to become an actress, a decision she later regretted. (In the late 1940s, Peters returned to college, in between filming, to complete her work and obtain a degree.)

Fox announced that in her first film &quot;I Wonder Who&#x27;s Kissing Her Now&quot; (1947), she would play an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, supported by &quot;artificial freckles and horn-rimmed glasses&quot;. She eventually withdrew from the film. Peters was tested in 1946 for a farm girl role in &quot;Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!&quot; (1948), but the producer and director decided she was not suitable.

===Film debut===
Peters was selected to replace Linda Darnell as the female lead in &quot;Captain from Castile&quot; (1947) opposite Tyrone Power, when Darnell was reassigned to save the production of &quot;Forever Amber&quot;. Although she had not yet made her screen debut, Peters was highly publicized. She received star treatment during the filming. &quot;Captain from Castile&quot; was a hit. Leonard Maltin wrote that afterwards, Peters spent the new decade playing &quot;sexy spitfires, often in period dramas and Westerns.&quot; 

She was offered a similar role in the Western &quot;Yellow Sky&quot; (1948), but she refused the part, explaining it was &quot;too sexy&quot;. As a result, the studio, frustrated by her stubbornness, put her on her first suspension.

For her second film, &quot;Deep Waters&quot; (1948), which Peters filmed in late 1947, she was reunited with her director from &quot;Captain from Castile&quot;, Henry King. On this, she commented: &quot;It&#x27;s really a break for me, because he knows where he&#x27;s going and what he wants, and I naturally have great confidence in him.&quot; The film was not nearly as successful as &quot;Captain from Castile&quot;, but Peters was again noticed. She was named among the best five &#x27;finds&#x27; of the year, among Barbara Bel Geddes, Valli, Richard Widmark and Wanda Hendrix. 

She was next assigned to co-star next to Clifton Webb in &quot;Mr. Belvedere Goes to College&quot; (1949), but Shirley Temple later replaced her.

In early 1949 Peters signed on to play Ray Milland&#x27;s love interest in &quot;It Happens Every Spring&quot; (1949). For the role, she offered to bleach her hair, but the studio overruled this. Although the film became a success, most of the publicity was for Milland&#x27;s performance.

Peters next starred alongside Paul Douglas in the period film &quot;Love That Brute&quot; (1950), for which she had to wear a dress so snug she was unable to sit. The film was originally titled &quot;Turned Up Toes,&quot; and Peters was cast in the film in June 1949, shortly after the release of &quot;It Happens Every Spring&quot;. To prepare for a singing and dancing scene, Peters took a few lessons with Betty Grable&#x27;s dance instructor.

By 1950, Peters was almost forgotten by the public, but she had been playing lead roles since 1947. In late 1950, she was cast in a secondary role as a college girl in &quot;Take Care of My Little Girl&quot; (1951). A Long Beach newspaper reported that Peters gained her role by impressing Jean Negulesco with her sewing. She once became famous for playing a simple country girl, but as she grew up, the studio did not find her any more suitable roles.

===Stardom===
At her insistence, Peters was given the title role in &quot;Anne of the Indies&quot; (1951), which the press declared was the film that finally brought her stardom. Before its release, she was cast in &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952) opposite Marlon Brando. Julie Harris had been considered for this role. Also in 1951, Peters had her first collaboration with Marilyn Monroe, when they had secondary roles in &quot;As Young as You Feel&quot;.

Peters was set to play the title role in the drama film &quot;Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie&quot; (1952). It was the first time since the beginning of her career that Peters received this much publicity. While shooting the film in Hutchinson, Kansas, Peters was honored with the title &#x27;Miss Wheatheart of America&#x27;. Peters was one of many names in the studios &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot; (1952). She co starred with Jeffrey Hunter in &quot;Lure of the Wilderness&quot; (1952).

In 1953, director Samuel Fuller chose Peters over Marilyn Monroe for the part of Candy in &quot;Pickup on South Street.&quot; He said he thought Peters had the right blend of sex appeal and the tough-talking, streetwise quality he was seeking. Monroe, he said, was too innocent-looking for the role. Shelley Winters and Betty Grable had been considered, but both had turned it down. Because of the sexual attractiveness of her character, Peters was not thrilled with the role. She preferred playing more down-to-earth, unglamorous parts as she had done with &quot;Anne of the Indies&quot; (1951), &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952) and &quot;Lure of the Wilderness&quot; (1952).

For &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot;, Peters was advised to bleach her hair, but she refused to do so, wanting to avoid comparisons with Winters and Grable. She did agree to adopt a &quot;sexy shuffle&quot; for the role. She was helped by Marilyn Monroe to understand the role of a siren. Peters later said that she had enjoyed making the film, but announced in an interview that she was not willing to take on other siren roles. She said: &quot;&quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; was fine for my career, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to put on a tight sweater and skirt and slither around. I&#x27;m just not the type. On Marilyn Monroe it looks good. On me it would look silly.&quot; In another interview, Peters explained that playing down-to-earth and sometimes unwashed women have the most to offer in the way of drama.

She said:
 

Peters and Marilyn Monroe starred together in &quot;Niagara&quot;, also starring Joseph Cotten. In &quot;Niagara&quot;, Peters replaced Anne Baxter, with whom she co-starred in the anthology film &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot; (1952). Shooting of &quot;Niagara&quot; took place in the summer of 1952. Peters&#x27;s character was initially the leading role, but the film eventually became a vehicle for Monroe, who was by that time more successful.

Peters&#x27;s third film in 1953, &quot;A Blueprint for Murder&quot;, reunited her with Joseph Cotten. She was assigned to the film in December 1952 and told the press she liked playing in the film because it allowed her to sing, but no song by her is used in the picture, only the playing of a piano. Shortly after the film&#x27;s premiere in July 1953, the studio renewed Peters&#x27; contract for another two years.

In 1953, she also starred in the film noir &quot;Vicki&quot;. Writer Leo Townsend bought the story of the film, a remake of &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot;, as a vehicle for Peters. Townsend said that he gave the role to Peters in December 1952, because she was &quot;one of the greatest sirens he&#x27;s ever seen.&quot;

Next, Peters was assigned to replace Crain in the film &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1954), which was shot on location in late 1953 in Italy. Peters was unsatisfied with her role and said in a September 1953 interview: &quot;When I heard Dorothy McGuire, Clifton Webb, and Maggie McNamara were going to be in the picture, I thought I would finally have the kind of role that suited me. They sounded like smart, sophisticated company. But when I got to Italy and read the script, I discovered I was going to be an earthy kind of girl again. The script had me nearly being killed in a runaway truck.&quot; However, the film became a great success and brought Peters again into the limelight.

===Final films===

Other 1954 films co-starring Peters were the Westerns &quot;Apache&quot; (borrowed by Warner Bros.) and &quot;Broken Lance&quot;. Although &quot;Broken Lance&quot; did not attract much attention, she was critically acclaimed for her performance in &quot;Apache.&quot; One critic praised her for &quot;giving an excellent account for herself&quot;, declaring she was &quot;on her way to becoming one of the finest young actresses around Hollywood today.&quot;

Peters&#x27;s next (and ultimately final) film was &quot;A Man Called Peter&quot; (1955), in which she played Catherine Marshall, the wife of Peter Marshall, a Presbyterian minister and chaplain of the United States Senate. After the release of &quot;A Man Called Peter,&quot; Peters refused several roles, for which she was placed on suspension by the studio.

===Retirement===
Deciding she had had enough, Peters left Fox to focus on her private life. Following her marriage to Howard Hughes, she retired from acting. In 1957, the producer Jerry Wald tried to persuade her not to leave Hollywood but had no luck. She was supposedly discouraged from continuing as an actress by Hughes, and reported in late 1957 that she was planning on becoming a producer.

In March 1959, it was announced that Peters was to return to the screen for a supporting role in &quot;The Best of Everything&quot;. But, she did not appear in that film; and, despite her earlier announcement, never produced a film.

===Return to acting===
In 1970, rumors arose of Peters making a comeback to acting when the press reported that she was considering three film offers and a weekly TV series for the 1970–1971 season. She chose the television movie &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; (1973). Afterwards, she said, &quot;I am not pleased with the show or my performance in it. I found it rather dull.&quot; At the beginning, she had expressed enthusiasm for the project, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m very fond of this script. It&#x27;s the right age for me. I won&#x27;t have to pretend I&#x27;m a glamour girl.&quot; Her co-star William Windom praised her, saying she was &quot;warm, friendly, and charming on the set.&quot;

In 1976, Peters had a supporting role in the TV miniseries &quot;The Moneychangers&quot;. When asked why she took the role, she said: &quot;I&#x27;ll be darned if I know. A moment of madness, I think. I ran into my old friend Ross Hunter, who was producing &quot;The Moneychangers&quot; for NBC-TV, and he asked me if I wanted to be in it. It seemed like fun. It&#x27;s a nice part – not too big – and I greatly admire Christopher Plummer, whom I play opposite.&quot;

Peters appeared in the 1981 television film &quot;Peter and Paul&quot;, produced by her then-husband, Stan Hough. She guest-starred in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in 1988, which was her final acting performance.

==Personal life==
After landing a contract in Hollywood, Peters moved there, where she initially lived with her aunt, Melba Diesel. From the beginning of her career, Peters openly admitted she did not like fame due to the crowds. Co-actors at Fox recalled that she was very serious about her career. Jeanne Crain said Peters was &quot;anything but a party girl&quot;. Despite her clashes with the studio, Peters was well-liked by other contract players.

One biographer recalled: &quot;In all the research and planning that went into this book, no one ever had an unkind word to say of Miss Peters, and that is unusual.&quot; Peters was close friends with Marilyn Monroe, who also worked for Fox. Other actors she befriended during her career were Joseph Cotten, David Niven, Ray Milland, Marie McDonald, and especially Jeanne Crain.

In 1954, Peters married Texas oilman Stuart Cramer (grandson of Stuart W. Cramer). At the time they married, they had known each other for only a few weeks, and they separated a few months later. There was much talk of Peters possibly retiring from the screen, but the actress insisted that after her eight-week leave from Fox, she was to return to Hollywood.

The decorated soldier and actor, Audie Murphy, met Peters when both were students at the Actors Lab. They had a very warm affair in 1946; during this time she met Howard Hughes.

In 1957, after her divorce from Cramer, Peters married Howard Hughes. Soon after that, he retreated from public view and, reportedly, started becoming an eccentric recluse. The couple had met in the 1940s, before Peters became a film actress. During their highly publicized romance in 1947 there was talk of marriage, but Peters said that she could not combine it with her career. The columnist Jack Anderson claimed that Peters was &quot;the only woman [Hughes] ever loved.&quot; He reportedly had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship. The actor Max Showalter confirmed this, after becoming a close friend of Peters during shooting of &quot;Niagara&quot; (1953).

During her marriage, which lasted from 1957 to 1971, Peters retired from acting and social events in Hollywood. According to a 1969 article, she went through life unrecognized, despite being protected by Hughes&#x27;s security officers all day. Living in anonymity was easy, according to Peters, because she &quot;didn&#x27;t act like an actress.&quot; It was later reported that during the marriage, Peters was frequently involved in activities such as charitable work, arts and crafts, and university studies including psychology and anthropology at UCLA.

In 1971, Peters and Hughes divorced. She agreed to a lifetime alimony payment of $70,000 ($ today) annually, adjusted for inflation, and she waived all claims to Hughes&#x27;s estate, then worth several billion dollars. In the media, she refused to speak about the marriage, claiming she preferred to focus on the present and future. She said that she hoped to avoid being known as &#x27;Mrs. Howard Hughes&#x27; for the rest of her life, although that would be difficult. &quot;I&#x27;m a realist. I know what the score is, and I know who the superstar is.&quot;

Later in 1971, Peters married Stan Hough, an executive with 20th Century Fox. They were married until Hough&#x27;s death in 1990. 

Peters died of leukemia on October 13, 2000, in Carlsbad, California, two days before her 74th birthday. She was buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Gerard is a lunar impact crater that lies along the western edge of the Oceanus Procellarum near the northwest limb of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is located to the north-northwest of the crater von Braun, and northeast of Bunsen. Because of its location, Gerard appears strongly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth, hindering observation.

This is a worn and eroded formation with a rim that has been nearly obliterated in some locations and distorted in others. The northern half of the rim has outward bulges to the northeast, north, and northwest. The interior floor is rough in places, with several small and tiny craters along the floor and the eastern rim.

To the northwest of this formation is the unusual Gerard Q Inner (eastern floor covered in dark-hued basaltic lava) within the larger Gerard Q Outer, and a system of rilles named the Rimae Gerard. These extend for a distance of about 100 kilometers. Like many craters in this region of the moon (such as Von Braun and Bunsen), the floor of Gerard Q Inner is fractured.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gerard.

<doc id="1285618" wikidata="Q1607983" url="?curid=1285618" title="Erysipeloid">
<text>In humans, &quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot; infections most commonly present in a mild cutaneous form known as erysipeloid or fish poisoning. &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; can cause an indolent cellulitis, more commonly in individuals who handle fish and raw meat. &quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot; also causes Swine Erysipelas. It is common in domestic pigs and can be transmitted to humans who work with swine. It gains entry typically by abrasions in the hand. Bacteremia and endocarditis are uncommon but serious sequelae. Due to the rarity of reported human cases, &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; infections are frequently misidentified at presentation.

==Diagnosis==
Violaceous swelling with severe pain but without pus (Which differentiates from pus forming streptococcal and staphylococcal erysipelas)

==Erysipeloid of Rosenbach==
Erysipeloid of Rosenbach is a cutaneous condition most frequently characterized by a purplish marginated swelling on the hands. The eponym Rosenbach&#x27;s disease is in reference to the milder type of the condition and is named after Friedrich Julius Rosenbach. Early work on the condition in US fishermen was carried out by Klaunders and colleagues.

==Treatment==
The treatment of choice is a single dose of benzathine benzylpenicillin given by intramuscular injection, or a five-day to one-week course of either oral penicillin or intramuscular procaine benzylpenicillin. Erythromycin or doxycycline may be given instead to people who are allergic to penicillin. &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; is intrinsically resistant to vancomycin.

<text>Pleopeltis polypodioides, common name resurrection fern, is a species of creeping, coarse-textured fern native to the Americas and Africa.

==Description==
The evergreen fronds of &quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot; are 25 cm high by 5 cm wide and monomorphic. The leathery, yellow-green pinnae (leaflets) are deeply pinnatifid, oblong to narrowly lanceolate, usually widest near middle, occasionally at or near base. It attaches to the limbs of its host plant with a branching, creeping, slender rhizome, which grows to 2 mm in diameter. The scales are lanceolate, with light brown base and margins, and having a dark central stripe.
The gametophytes (the haploid gamete producers) develop from very small spores that float in the air and are deposited on moist tree branches. These spores are produced in sporangia that develop on the leaves of the fern&#x27;s sporophyte. The fern can also reproduce by the division of its rhizomes.

On the underside of the blades, the sori (reproductive clusters) are round, discrete, and sunken. Their outline can be seen as raised dimples on the upper surface. They are typically near the outer edge, and occur on all but the lowest pinnae of fertile fronds. Indusia are absent. Sporangia are yellow to brown at maturity. Spores are produced from summer to fall.

== Distribution and habitat ==

&quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot; resides in the hardwood forests of southeastern United States in areas including Delaware, Maryland, the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Ohio, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma. This fern can also be found in areas such as subtropical America, parts of southern Africa and other humid or sub-humid climate areas.

This fern is an epiphyte, or air plant, which means it attaches itself to other plants and gets its nutrients from the air and from water and nutrients that collect on the outer surface of bark. The resurrection fern lives on the branches of large trees such as cypresses and can often be seen carpeting the shady areas on limbs of large oak trees repeatedly exposed to rainfall. However, it is known to grow on the surfaces of rocks and dead logs as well. It is often found in the company of other epiphytic plants, such as Spanish moss.

== Physiology and rehydration ==
&quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot; gets its common name &quot;resurrection fern&quot; because it can survive long periods of drought by curling up its fronds and appearing desiccated, grey-brown and dead. However, when just a little water is present, the fern will uncurl and reopen, appearing to &quot;resurrect&quot;. It has been estimated that these plants could last 100 years without water and still revive after a single exposure.

The roots have evolved to function as anchors to tree bark. They have been found to be inefficient in absorption. When in clustered groups of ferns on the bark of trees, the increased transpiration of the ferns and bark allows the middle ferns of the cluster to remain open longer than ferns on the outside. The relative humidity of the air and the closing rate of the leaves of the ferns is an inverse relationship. The greater the humidity, the slower the leaves close because of prolonged exposure to moisture in the air.

&quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot; can severely desiccate and lose almost all of its water. Experiments have shown it can lose up to 97% and remain alive, though more typically, it loses around 76% in dry spells. For comparison, most other plants would die after losing only 8–12% water. Upon rainfall or even minute exposures to water, they can fully rehydrate and return to a normal state in 24 to 48 hours. Following substantial exposures to moisture, there is an immediate increase in its water content of up to 50% after the first hour and 65–70% after three hours. When it regains moisture, the fern can once again become photosynthetically active, increasing its metabolism and release of organic compounds that provide nutrients for symbiotic bacteria that allow them both to thrive.  

At least one study has shown association between &quot;P. polypodioides&quot; and moss, indicating that this fern may rely on moss for some of its water needs.
Resurrection ferns accumulate sugar in dehydrated cells in order to protect them and stabilize the membranes and proteins in the dry state. By accumulating sugar, the cells can maintain hydrogen bonds between necessary macromolecules needed for their structure. An interesting feature of the resurrection fern is it does not immediately take up water after having been in a desiccated state. &quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot; has a porous cell structure network that can expand and rearrange to accommodate absorbing three to four times its weight in water after being exposed.
When the fronds &quot;dry&quot;, the mesophyll deforms, which causes the lamina to curl and exposes the underside and show the peltate scales. The peltate scales help prevent photooxidation and mechanical damage, as well as assist in quick rehydration. The fern fronds contain canal cells in the center of their surface scales that direct water to the epidermis of the fern leaves, allowing absorption. The ability of the fern fronds to unroll after exposure to desiccation is attributed to the large cells of the upper epidermis along the midrib of the frond that increase in width more than any other epidermal cell, which forces the fronds to uncurl and flatten out.

&quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot; has adapted to survive desiccation with the ability of its cell walls to deform and reform, without bursting or rupturing. It has been observed that dehydrins may allow the cell walls of the fern fronds and leaves to deform and reform in times of extreme drought followed by water exposure, due to large fluctuations in water content. Dehydrins were found to be expressed only when the fern was drying or in the desiccated state, with the dehydrins located on the outsides of the cells near the cell walls, allowing the leaves and fronds of the ferns to deform and reform accordingly.

Thermoluminescence of the resurrection fern has been tested to observe at what temperatures it occurs and therefore shows what temperatures and amount of desiccation the ferns can tolerate before their chloroplasts lose the energy they have stored for the plant in the form of light emissions. One study found the resurrection fern required high temperatures before thermoluminescence occurred at around , whereas other desiccation-tolerant plants showed thermoluminescence at The thermoluminescent activity of the resurrection fern increased as it was exposed to six separate but consecutive flashes of green safelight at its leaves. Because thermoluminescence from the fern fronds was not observed until higher temperatures, this hints that the fern’s chloroplasts may have a mechanism to withhold and store energy for the fern as it desiccates, allowing it to survive higher temperatures and extreme periods of desiccation.

==Reproduction==

The fern has spores on the bottom of the fronds, contained in sori. Sori can be found aligned in rows on the underside of fertile fronds. They start as yellow, but as they mature, they turn brown and split. The fern sporulates in summer and early fall. Rhizome sections are also viable offspring and can root themselves in new medium.

<text>The Pluton missile was a French nuclear-armed tactical ballistic missile (short-range ballistic missile, SRBM) system launched from a transporter erector launcher (TEL) platform mounted on an AMX-30 tank chassis. It was designed to provide the tactical part of French nuclear deterrence during the Cold War.

== Development ==
The Pluton came in replacement of the U.S.-built Honest John missile. It had an operating range between , with a CEP of 150 m. This short range only allowed strikes on targets in West Germany or within France itself, which led to the development of the longer ranged &quot;Hadès&quot; missile.

The system was relatively light-weight, which allowed its deployment in difficult conditions. A CT-20 drone was available to provide last-minute information about the target before launch, making the &quot;Pluton&quot; system battle-capable.

A project for an updated version, called &quot;Super-Pluton&quot;, was dropped in favour of the &quot;Hadès&quot; project, and the aging &quot;Pluton&quot; was gradually discarded until completely retired in 1993.

== Units ==
The regiments and groups which used the equipment included:

* 1st Army Corps
** 3rd Artillery Regiment (1970–1990)
** 4th Artillery Regiment (1976–1980)
** 15th Artillery Regiment (1974–1990)
* 2nd Army Corps
** 32nd Artillery Regiment (1977–1993)
** 74th Artillery Regiment (1975–1993)
* 3rd Army Corps

<text>Alpinia purpurata, commonly referred to as red ginger, ostrich plume and pink cone ginger, is a ginger native to Maluku and the southwest Pacific islands. In typical ginger fashion, &quot;A. purpurata&quot; is a rhizomatous plant, spreading underground in a horizontal growth habit, sending feeder roots downwards into the substrate and sprouting leafy vertical stems from nodes located along the rhizome. As its common name implies, red ginger blooms with showy inflorescences on long, bright magenta- to red-hued bracts; while they appear to be a blossom, bracts are in fact modified leaves that contain the plant&#x27;s actual flowers. Bracts are a common feature of many botanical genera (such as &quot;Euphorbia&quot; sp. or the Araceae family), having evolved to protect and resemble the flowers and appeal to pollinators. The actual flower &quot;parts&quot; (pollen, pistil, stamen, etc.) are located inside, often accessed by crawling insects like ants or beetles.

Red ginger has several cultivars, such as &quot;A. purpurata&quot; &#x27;Jungle King&#x27; and &#x27;Jungle Queen&#x27;. The plant grows in many regions outside of its native southwest Pacific islands, including the countries and territories of Dominica, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Hawaii, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname (where its Dutch name is &quot;bokkepoot&quot;, or &quot;billy-goat&#x27;s foot&quot;) and Trinidad and Tobago, in addition to several Central American nations, including Belize and Panama. It is also found in Samoa, where it is the national flower, locally called &quot;teuila&quot;.

Red ginger can also be grown successfully in the United States, in places such as South Florida and coastal Southern California, as these regions&#x27; winter low temperatures do not typically reach freezing, usually dropping no lower than 45°-50 °F (about 7°-10 °C) at the coldest points of the year. Additionally, the plant may require extra overhead sun protection, as well as irrigation, in drier, hotter or sunnier climes outside its native range; as with many ginger species, red ginger prefers partial shade, indirect light and consistently moist—but not saturated—soil conditions, with preferably high levels of ambient humidity. If care is provided that the leaves do not sunburn, the red ginger can tolerate a few hours of full sun, earlier in the day. Extra light may help to stimulate more vivid foliage and vibrant blooms. In addition to planting in outdoor landscapes, red ginger may also be grown as an indoor houseplant (if provided with adequate light exposure). It can be successfully conditioned to grow in LECA or PON (in full, passive or semi-hydroponic setups). Its cut flowers and leaves are often used in floral arrangements and tropical bouquets.

In Hawaii, the flowers of red ginger are grown commercially for sale, and have been associated with the Hamakua area for a long time. Once a very common flower regionally, the gardening community there has experienced a slight decline in recent years, though is starting to make a comeback. Red ginger blooms are also, sometimes, called &quot;graveyard flowers&quot; as they are customarily placed at loved ones&#x27; headstones, lasting for quite a while thanks to their vigor &amp; long shelf-life as a cut flower.

<text>Robin Mark Askwith (born 12 October 1950) is an English actor and singer who has appeared in a number of film, television and stage productions.

Making his film debut as Keating in the film &quot;if...&quot; (1968), a role he would reprise in &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982), Askwith went on to appear in many films including &quot;Otley&quot; (1969), &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (1969), &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (1972), the horror films &quot;Tower of Evil&quot; (1972), &quot;The Flesh and Blood Show&quot; (1972) and &quot;Horror Hospital&quot; (1973) and the comedy films &quot;Bless This House&quot; (1972), &quot;Carry On Girls&quot; (1973) and &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British&quot; (1973). However it was his role as Timothy Lea in the &quot;Confessions&quot; film series that would make him a household name.

Askwith has appeared on television as Fred Pickering in &quot;Beryl&#x27;s Lot&quot; (1973–1975), Dave Deacon in &quot;Bottle Boys&quot; (1984–1985) and Ritchie de Vries in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (2013–2014).

In 1975, at Drury Lane&#x27;s New London Theatre, Askwith was voted &quot;Most Promising Newcomer – Male&quot; at the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Awards. Askwith&#x27;s most recent television roles include &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, &quot;Benidorm&quot; and a main role in &quot;The Madame Blanc Mysteries&quot;.

==Early life==
Askwith was born in Southport, Lancashire, England, the eldest child of Nelson and Hazel Askwith (née Cookson). His father was an accountant but served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War and his mother in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (WRENs). As a young child, he swam in a pool contaminated with insects; later that day Askwith&#x27;s mother found him fully submerged underwater in the bath. Taken to hospital in an ambulance, Askwith was found to have contracted polio and had to spend nine months in an isolation ward at Southport Infirmary and had to learn how to walk again. Shortly after this, the family moved from Southport to Eastcote, London where Askwith was educated at Orley Farm in nearby Harrow. Particularly sporty at school, Askwith represented the school at football, rugby and cricket and after joining the Ruislip and Northwood Swimming Club, he represented the South Counties at backstroke.

Askwith began an interest in acting because his neighbour was the floor manager at Pinewood Studios where he and his neighbour&#x27;s son would watch movies being filmed, including &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963) and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963). The next-door neighbour of a friend was &quot;Carry On&quot; actor Kenneth Connor, and so Askwith began attending a local amateur dramatics group. He also did a stint of modelling for catalogues and appeared in several commercials for baked beans and Fairy Liquid. 

After finishing at Orley Farm at the age of twelve, Askwith attended Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood. He found the school unduly strict and became a rebellious student to the extent that Askwith and two friends stole several rifles from the school armoury and held up Pinner post office stealing hundreds of pounds&#x27; worth of stamps with the intention of returning them the following week. Askwith also persuaded a crane operator, who was carrying out work at the school, to lift the headmaster&#x27;s car onto the school roof.

As a result of playing King Edward IV during a school production of &quot;Richard III&quot;, Askwith was approached by film director Lindsay Anderson, who had been in the audience, and encouraged to audition for a role in his upcoming film &quot;if...&quot;. Following a successful audition he played the role of Keating in the film.

==Career==
Following the success of &quot;if...&quot;, Askwith made his television debut as a yob in the BBC series &quot;Scene&quot;. He would also attend the Corona Theatre School in between acting jobs. Askwith had roles in the historical epic film &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (1969), the thriller &quot;Otley&quot; (1969), and, playing the title role, in the film version of &quot;Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates&quot; (1969). In 1970, Askwith had his first major role in the comedy film &quot;Cool It Carol!&quot; (1970).

Askwith then appeared on television in series such as &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; and &quot;Father, Dear Father&quot; and a recurring role as Eddie in &quot;Please Sir!&quot; and its spin-off &quot;The Fenn Street Gang&quot;, before having his first regular role as Harvey Micklethwaite in the sitcom &quot;On The House&quot; in 1971. In 1970, Askwith starred in &quot;Scramble&quot; (1970), the first of four films he would make for the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation, the others being &quot;All Coppers Are...&quot; (1971), &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Hostages&quot; (1975). Askwith also had a role in the epic film &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971). He would then have roles in television series including &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Public Eye&quot;, &quot;The Main Chance&quot; and &quot;Bless This House&quot;, and in a deleted scene from the film &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot; (1972). Askwith also starred in a string of horror films: &quot;Tower of Evil&quot; (1972), &quot;The Flesh and Blood Show&quot; (1973) and &quot;Horror Hospital&quot; (1973).

After appearing in Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (1972) and the comedy film &quot;Four Dimensions of Greta&quot; (1972), Askwith played Mike Abbot in the film version of television sitcom &quot;Bless This House&quot; (1972). During filming, Askwith became good friends with co-star Sid James. Other members of the cast included comedy stalwarts Peter Butterworth, Terry Scott, June Whitfield and Wendy Richard. Impressed by his performance, the producers offered Askwith a role in &quot;Carry On Girls&quot; (1973) which also starred Sid James.

Shortly after starring in Antony Balch&#x27;s &quot;Horror Hospital&quot; (1973), Askwith was offered the starring role in &quot;Confessions of a Window Cleaner&quot; (1974), directed by Val Guest. The part had been turned down by Richard Beckinsale, Richard O&#x27;Sullivan, Nicky Henson and Dennis Waterman. The success of the film led to three sequels, &quot;Confessions of a Pop Performer&quot; (1975), &quot;Confessions of a Driving Instructor&quot; (1976) and &quot;Confessions from a Holiday Camp&quot; (1977).

Although the &quot;Confessions&quot; series came to an end with &quot;Confessions from a Holiday Camp&quot;, a fifth and a sixth film, &quot;Confessions of a Plumber&#x27;s Mate&quot; and &quot;Confessions of a Private Soldier&quot; had been planned. Askwith even expressed a desire to direct &quot;Private Soldier&quot;, but neither film materialised. Plans to shoot a further made-for-video &quot;Confessions&quot; film in the 1980s also came to nothing, although by this time he was appearing in the poorly received ITV sitcom &quot;Bottle Boys&quot; (1984–1985).

He has also had roles in the soap operas &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; where he played a holiday tour guide named Aidan. The episodes of the soap that featured Askwith were filmed in Malta, close to the island of Gozo where he has lived for many years. Askwith returned to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on 11 December 2013 as musician Ritchie de Vries.

Askwith published his autobiography, titled &quot;The Confessions of Robin Askwith&quot; in 1999. In 2000, Askwith had a role in the horror film &quot;The Asylum&quot;.

Askwith made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Run For Your Wife&quot;, released in the UK on 14 February 2013. Askwith also appeared in an episode of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; in 2015. His role as con-man Marcus Hornby in the TV comedy drama &quot;Benidorm&quot; was broadcast in January 2016, and his episode of &quot;Casualty&quot; aired later that year.

In 2021, he joined the cast of Channel 5&#x27;s drama series &quot;The Madame Blanc Mysteries&quot; appearing alongside Sue Holderness, Sally Lindsay and Steve Edge as a series regular. The first series received a positive reception which led to a Christmas special broadcast in 2022 succeeded by a second series to be broadcast in 2023. In December 2022, Askwith appeared in the fourth and final episode of the quartet, &quot;Strike: Troubled Blood&quot;, on BBC1. His character, Steve Douthwaite, plays one of the suspected killers in the J. K. Rowling-inspired mystery crime drama. 

In 2023, it was announced that he would appear in the eighth series of &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;, and his name was used in the promotion for episode 5, &quot;Hold on Tight!&quot;. However the episode was fake and never produced, instead the hoax quiz show &quot;3 by 3&quot; was episode 5 of the series. 

In 2024 Askwith appeared in the ninth series of Inside No. 9, trying to get Shearsmith and Pemberton to create a real-life version of Hold on Tight!. 

===Stage work===
Askwith&#x27;s extensive work on stage, includes numerous farces such as &quot;Run For Your Wife&quot;, &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, &quot;One for the Road&quot; plus the stage &quot;Confessions&quot; sequel &quot;The Further Confessions of a Window Cleaner&quot; and Terry Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dead Funny&quot;. From 11 December 2012 – 27 January 2013, he appeared at the Mill at Sonning, Reading, Berkshire in Ray Cooney&#x27;s farce &quot;Caught in the Net&quot;.

In pantomimes, Askwith has appeared with the Chuckle Brothers in Dick Whittington, with Frank Bruno and Sooty in a Wolverhampton production of &quot;Goldilocks and the 3 Bears&quot; and in various productions of &quot;Aladdin&quot; as Abanazar.

More unusual stage roles include the title role in a production of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot;, and the Child Catcher in a 2006 touring production of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;.

==Personal life==
Askwith had relationships with the actresses Cheryl Hall and later Linda Hayden during the 1970s. Askwith married actress Leonie Mellinger in 1988 but they later divorced. From 1996 to 2002, he was married to Mary Smith, an aromatherapist.

Askwith lives on Gozo, a Mediterranean island near Malta, having moved there in 1991, where his hobbies include swimming, underwater diving and yachting, however he regularly returns to the UK for tours, events and filming.

Askwith is a great-nephew of the comic Robb Wilton.

He is a passionate cricket follower and also a supporter of Queens Park Rangers F.C.

<doc id="1285644" wikidata="Q472970" url="?curid=1285644" title="Geoffrey Winthrop Young">
<text>Geoffrey Winthrop Young (25 October 1876 – 8 September 1958) was a British climber, poet and educator, and author of several notable books on mountaineering.

Young was born in Kensington, the middle son of Sir George Young, 3rd Baronet, a noted classicist and charity commissioner, of Formosa Place at Cookham in Berkshire, where he grew up. His mother, formerly Alice Eacy Kennedy, was the daughter of Dr Evory Kennedy of Belgard Co. Dublin and had previously lived in India as Lady Lawrence, wife of Sir Alexander Lawrence, Bt, nephew to the Viceroy, Lord Lawrence. Widowed when Sir Alexander died in a bridge collapse, Alice returned to England, marrying Sir George in 1871. Winthrop&#x27;s brother Edward Hilton Young became the 1st Baron Kennet. 

==Mountaineering==
Educated at Marlborough, Young began rock climbing shortly before his first term at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied Classics and won the &quot;Chancellor&#x27;s Medal for English Verse&quot; two years running. While there, Young wrote a humorous college climbing guide called &quot;The Roof-Climber&#x27;s Guide to Trinity&quot;, in part a parody of early alpine guidebooks, in part a useful reference work for those, like him, who were keen to clamber up Cambridge&#x27;s highest spires. During his time as a student at Cambridge he developed a close life-long friendship with G. M. Trevelyan who was a contemporary at Trinity College.

During the Edwardian Period, and up until the outbreak of hostilities heralding World War I, Young made several new and difficult ascents in the Alps, including noted routes on the Zermatt Breithorn on Monte Rosa (the &quot;Younggrat&quot;), the west ridge of the Gspaltenhorn, on the west face of the Weisshorn, and a dangerous and rarely repeated route on the south face of the Täschhorn. His finest rock climb was the Mer de Glace face of the Aiguille du Grépon. In 1911, with H. O. Jones, he ascended the Brouillard ridge of Mont Blanc and made the first complete traverse of the west ridge of the Grandes Jorasses, and the first descent of the ridge to the Col des Hirondelles. His favoured, but not only, guide was Josef Knubel of St Niklaus.

Winthrop Young also put up new routes on the crags of Northumberland the Lake District and Wales. He was elected president of the Climbers&#x27; Club in 1913, and he organised the Pen-y-Pass gatherings that propelled the advancement of rock climbing and included such technical luminaries as J. M. Archer Thompson, George Leigh Mallory, Siegfried Herford, John Percy Farrar and Oscar Eckenstein. These parties, beginning in earnest about 1907, and sometimes reaching sixty men, women and children, flooded the hotel and overflowed into Eckenstein&#x27;s miner&#x27;s cabin and various tents. They came to an end in 1914.

==World War I and injury==
During the war, Young was at first a correspondent for the liberal &quot;Daily News&quot;, but later, as a conscientious objector, was active in the FAU, the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit. Sent to Italy he drove ambulances sometimes in the thick of battle, and as such he received several decorations. On 31 August 1917 on the Isonzo Front during the fight for Monte San Gabriele, an explosion caused injuries requiring the amputation of one of his legs. After the amputation, Young walked sixteen miles in two days to avoid being captured by the Austrians. He continued alpine climbing for a number of years – using a specially designed artificial leg that accepted a number of attachments for snow and rock work – and climbed the Matterhorn in 1928.

At the conclusion of the war in 1918 he married Eleanor Winthrop Young (née Slingsby), who helped him return to climbing after his amputation and often accompanied him on expeditions. Their son Jocelin was born on 25 October 1919, they moved to Cambridge at the end of 1924 and a daughter named Marcia was born on 11 March 1925, she went on to marry Peter Newbolt, the grandson of Sir Henry John Newbolt. Jocelin became a Royal Navy officer and an educator, he founded the Round Square association of schools and was private tutor to Constantine II of Greece. The biography written by Alan Hankinson mentions Winthrop Young&#x27;s bisexuality. 

==Outdoor educator and administrator==
In 1920 Young published the 300-page manual of mountaineering instruction entitled &quot;Mountain Craft&quot;, to which Eckenstein and J. Norman Collie also contributed. The editor of the Alpine Club, John Percy Farrar, wrote to Young on the book&#x27;s publication, saying: &#x27;The book is magnificent ... It will be standard for so long as mankind is interested in mountaineering. The profound amount of work put into it staggers me.&#x27;

To support himself and his family he worked for the Rockefeller Foundation, and spent much time in Germany, and – having met Kurt Hahn before the War – helped Hahn immigrate to England in 1934. Much of what may be called an outdoor adventure education springs from this connection. The now famous Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme and the International Award scheme comes from this co-operation between Hahn and Young. The Outward Bound movement, after World War II, owes a considerable debt to their friendship.

During World War II, Young was president of the Alpine Club and it was through his efforts that the British Mountaineering Council, the umbrella organisation for climbers in Great Britain, was created in 1945.

<doc id="1285648" wikidata="Q205661" url="?curid=1285648" title="Zirconium tungstate">
<text>Zirconium tungstate is the zirconium salt of tungstic acid with the formula . The phase formed at ambient pressure by reaction of ZrO2 and WO3 is a metastable cubic phase, which has negative thermal expansion characteristics, namely it shrinks over a wide range of temperatures when heated. In contrast to most other ceramics exhibiting negative CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion), the CTE of ZrW2O8 is isotropic and has a large negative magnitude (average CTE of -7.2x10−6K−1) over a wide range of temperature (-273 °C to 777 °C). A number of other phases are formed at high pressures.

==Cubic phase==
Cubic zirconium tungstate (alpha-ZrW2O8), one of the several known phases of zirconium tungstate (ZrW2O8) is perhaps one of the most studied materials to exhibit negative thermal expansion. It has been shown to contract continuously over a previously unprecedented temperature range of 0.3 to 1050 K (at higher temperatures the material decomposes). Since the structure is cubic, as described below, the thermal contraction is isotropic - equal in all directions. There is much ongoing research attempting to elucidate why the material exhibits such dramatic negative thermal expansion.

This phase is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature with respect to the binary oxides ZrO2 and WO3, but may be synthesised by heating stoichiometric quantities of these oxides together and then quenching the material by rapidly cooling it from approximately 900 °C to room temperature.

The structure of cubic zirconium tungstate consists of corner-sharing ZrO6 octahedral and WO4 tetrahedral structural units. Its unusual expansion properties are thought to be due to vibrational modes known as Rigid Unit Modes (RUMs), which involve the coupled rotation of the polyhedral units that make up the structure, and lead to contraction.

===Detailed crystal structure===
The arrangement of the groups in the structure of cubic ZrW2O8 is analogous to the simple NaCl structure, with ZrO6 octahedra at the Na sites, and W2O8 groups at the Cl sites. The unit cell consists of 44 atoms aligned in a primitive cubic Bravais lattice, with unit cell length 9.15462 Angstroms.

The ZrO6 octahedra are only slightly distorted from a regular conformation, and all oxygen sites in a given octahedron are related by symmetry. The W2O8 unit is made up of two crystallographically distinct WO4 tetrahedra, which are not formally bonded to each other. These two types of tetrahedra differ with respect to the W-O bond lengths and angles. The WO4 tetrahedra are distorted from a regular shape since one oxygen is unconstrained (an atom that is bonded only to the central tungsten (W) atom), and the three other oxygens are each bonded to a zirconium atom (&quot;i.e.&quot; the &quot;corner-sharing&quot; of polyhedra).

The structure has &quot;P213&quot; space group symmetry at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, a centre of inversion is introduced by the disordering of the orientation of tungstate groups, and the space group above the phase transition temperature (~180C) is &quot;Paformula_1&quot;.

Octahedra and tetrahedra are linked together by sharing an oxygen atom. In the image, note the corner-touching between octahedra and tetrahedra; these are the location of the shared oxygen. The vertices of the tetrahedra and octahedra represent the oxygen, which are spread about the central zirconium and tungsten. Geometrically, the two shapes can &quot;pivot&quot; around these corner-sharing oxygens, without a distortion of the polyhedra themselves. This pivoting is what is thought to lead to the negative thermal expansion, as in certain low frequency normal modes this leads to the contracting &#x27;RUMs&#x27; mentioned above.

==High pressure forms==

At high pressure, zirconium tungstate undergoes a series of phase transitions, first to an amorphous phase, and then to a U3O8-type phase, in which the zirconium and tungsten atoms are disordered.

==Zirconium tungstate-copper system==
Through hot-isostatically pressing (HIP) a ZrW2O8-Cu composite (system) can be realized. Work done by C. Verdon and D.C. Dunand in 1997 used similarly sized zirconium tungstate and copper powder in a low carbon steel can coated with Cu, and they were HIPed under 103MPa pressure for 3 hours at 600 °C. A control experiment was also conducted, with only a heat treatment (i.e., no pressing) for the same powder mixture also under 600 °C for 3 hours in a quartz tube gettered with titanium.

The results from X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the graph in Verdon &amp; Dunand&#x27;s paper shows expected products. (a) is from the as received zirconium tungstate powder, (b) is the result from the control experiment , and (c) is the ceramic product from the HIP process. Apparently there are new phases formed according to Spectrum (c) with no ZrW2O8 left. While for the control experiment only partial amount of ZrW2O8 was decomposed.

While complex oxides containing Cu, Zr, and W were believed to be created, selected area diffraction (SAD) of the ceramic product has proven the existence of Cu2O as precipitates after reaction. A model consisted of two concurrent processes were surmised (as presented): (b) the decomposition of the ceramic and loss of oxygen under low oxygen partial pressure at high temperature leads to Cu2O formation; (c) copper diffuses into the ceramic and forms new oxides that absorb some oxygen upon cooling.

Since only very few oxides, those of noble metals which are very expensive, are less stable than Cu2O and Cu2O was believed to be more stable than ZrW2O8, kinetic control of the reaction must be taken into account. For example, reducing reaction time and temperature helps alleviate the residual stress caused by different phases of the ceramic during reaction, which could lead to a delamination of the ceramic particles from the matrix and an increase in the CTE.

<doc id="1285649" wikidata="Q923188" url="?curid=1285649" title="Joe Royle">
<text>Joseph Royle (born 8 April 1949) is an English football manager and former footballer. In his playing career as a striker, he debuted for Everton at the age of 16 and went on to play for Manchester City, Bristol City, Norwich City, and the England national team. Later, he managed Oldham Athletic, Everton, Manchester City, and Ipswich Town. He is currently a director at Oldham Athletic.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
Royle was born in the Norris Green area of Liverpool on 8 April 1949. He attended Ranworth Square Primary School in Norris Green and Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool&#x27;s Allerton suburb, where he was an all-round sportsman. Unusually for a grammar schoolboy, he played for the Liverpool schoolboys team, which was usually drawn from secondary modern schools.

A number of clubs were interested in signing Royle, including Manchester United, but it was his hometown club Everton that succeeded in recruiting him to their ranks. He went on to make 270 appearances for Everton, scoring 119 times. He made his debut at the age of 16 and held the record of being the youngest player to play for Everton until James Vaughan beat the record on 10 April 2005 by 11 days. For five seasons he was Everton&#x27;s top scorer, notably scoring 23 goals in the Championship-winning side of 1969–70 and Manchester City manager Tony Book bought Royle for £170,000 in 1974 and he went on to claim further honours as he helped them to win the League Cup in 1976.

He left Maine Road in November 1977 to join Bristol City and had a further stint with Norwich City, including winning Norwich City player of the year in 1981, before being forced to retire from the game in 1982 (aged 33) due to a knee injury. In 2002, he was voted into the club&#x27;s hall of fame by Norwich supporters. His time at Bristol City, however, had not been so fruitful. After a storming on-loan debut, scoring four, he only tallied another 14 goals in the remaining 100 games with them.

===International career===
Royle was awarded the first of his six England caps against Malta in 1971.

== Managerial career ==
===Oldham Athletic===
In June 1982, Royle moved into management in the Second Division at Oldham Athletic. He spent more than 12 years in charge at Boundary Park, taking them into the First Division in 1991 (a year before it became the FA Premier League) as Second Division champions. Royle&#x27;s teams won many friends with their cavalier style of play, which was particularly evident during the season that they played on artificial turf on their home ground. Oldham reached a cup final for the first time in 1990 when they reached the final of the League Cup, but they were beaten 1–0 by Nottingham Forest. They also reached the FA Cup semi-finals that season, and held Manchester United to a 3–3 draw in the first match at Maine Road before losing the replay 2–1.

When England national football team manager Bobby Robson announced in May 1990 that he would be quitting the job after the World Cup that summer, Royle&#x27;s name was strongly linked with the role and the Football Association shortlisted him along with Graham Taylor and Howard Kendall. This was despite Royle having yet to manage in the First Division; whereas in contrast Kendall had won two league titles, an FA Cup and European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with Everton, and Taylor had taken both Aston Villa and Watford to runners-up spot in the top flight and Watford to an FA Cup final. Incredibly, Royle was selected on the shortlist ahead of Terry Venables, the Tottenham Hotspur manager whose managerial CV included taking Barcelona to the Spanish league title and to a European Cup final, as well as guiding Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers to an FA Cup final in 1982. Venables himself had expressed interest in the job – which would finally become his in January 1994. In the event, Graham Taylor was appointed as England&#x27;s new manager.

In 1991, Oldham finished champions of the Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division where they had last played 68 years earlier.

Royle was able to attract established stars to Oldham, as well as developing talent which would go on to excel at a higher level. These included striker Graeme Sharp – one of the most accomplished goalscorers of the past decade – who was signed from Everton in 1991, midfielder Mike Milligan (who was sold to Everton for £1million in 1990 and signed back for £600,000 a year later), left back Earl Barrett (who was one of the most expensive defenders in England when he was sold to Aston Villa for £1.7million in early 1992) and right-back Denis Irwin, who was signed on a free transfer from Leeds United in 1986 and was sold to Manchester United for £625,000 in 1990, where he went on to win numerous domestic and European honours over the next 12 years.

The Latics finished 17th in 1991–92 season – their first top flight campaign for almost 70 years – and secured their place in the new Premier League. A key game which helped ensure survival was a 5–1 home win over eventually relegated Luton Town, in which Graeme Sharp scored four goals. They also hosted Manchester United on Boxing Day 1991, and went down 6–3 in one of the most thrilling league contests of the season.

They survived on goal difference on the last day of the 1992–93 with a remarkable 4–3 home win over Southampton, their survival also boosted by an earlier 1–0 away win over Aston Villa – a victory which handed the title to Oldham&#x27;s local rivals Manchester United. This result sent Crystal Palace down instead.

However, 1993–94 brought another battle against relegation and this time the Latics were unable to win it. They were rarely outside the bottom three all season. Another away win over Southampton at the end of March 1994 lifted the Latics out of the relegation zone and a 4–1 home win over QPR in the next game put them three points clear of the drop zone with two games in hand. However, a late Manchester United equaliser put their FA Cup dream on ice in the Wembley semi-final and they were defeated 4–1 three days later in the Maine Road replay. The Premier League campaign had already brought two thrilling matches between Oldham and their bigger local rivals - a 5–2 win for United at Boundary Park just after Christmas, and at the beginning of April the return match at Old Trafford saw the hosts win a closely-fought game 3–2.

The Latics failed to win any of their final eight games and a 1–1 draw at Norwich City on the final day of the season was not enough to stave off relegation. Royle remained in charge of Oldham despite their relegation, and oversaw their first few months in Division One.

===Everton===
After 12 years of managing Oldham, Royle returned to Everton in November 1994 to succeed manager Mike Walker, who had been sacked after less than a year in charge following Everton&#x27;s worst start to a league season, with no wins from their first 12 league games. He permanently signed Scottish striker Duncan Ferguson, who was at Everton on loan. Ferguson would go on to play a big part in Everton&#x27;s success after Royle&#x27;s arrival, and would remain loyal to the team after retiring as a player in 2006 (taking a position as a trainer at Everton and even having an interim spell as manager in the 2019–20 season when he took over as temporary manager for three games before the arrival of Carlo Ancelotti).

Everton&#x27;s league form improved under Royle, and they achieved Premier League survival at the beginning of May, finally achieving a 15th-place finish. After defeating Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in the FA Cup semi-final, they went on to beat Manchester United 1–0 in the final, which remains their most recent major trophy to date.

That summer, Royle signed Manchester United&#x27;s top scorer Andrei Kanchelskis for a club record £5 million, and Everton progressed further in 1995–96 as they finished sixth in the league, although they only reached the second round of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, their first European campaign for 11 years. He then signed winger Gary Speed from Leeds United for £3.5 million in the summer of 1996, and paid a club record £5.75 million for Middlesbrough forward Nick Barmby later in 1996, but Everton&#x27;s form in 1996–97 was less convincing and on transfer deadline day in 1997 he was not permitted to sign Norwegians Tore André Flo and Claus Eftevaag by chairman Peter Johnson, which led to his resignation. Everton were just four points above the relegation zone when Royle resigned, their form having dipped since the sale of Andrei Kanchelskis to Fiorentina two months earlier.

Royle was named an Everton Giant in 2004 for his successes as both a player and a manager for the team.

===Manchester City===
After 11 months out of the game, he accepted the challenge to manage Manchester City in February 1998. When Royle arrived the club was battling against relegation from Division One. They won their final game of the season 5–2 away to Stoke City, but both teams were relegated due to the other three relegation-threatened teams all winning. Royle&#x27;s services were retained and he delivered an instant promotion the following season, as City beat Gillingham on penalties in the 1999 Division Two play-off final after drawing 2–2 in open play.
A year later, he delivered City a second successive promotion as they finished runners-up in Division One and clinched a place in the Premier League on the final day of the league season. However, City were relegated straight back to Division One and Royle was sacked in May 2001.

===Ipswich Town===
After more than a year out of the game, Royle returned to football in October 2002 to manage Ipswich Town, who had been relegated from the Premier League the previous season and had dismissed long-serving manager George Burley. From February to May 2003 the club was in administration, which led to the exit of several key players and a restriction of transfer and wage funds. Royle twice led Ipswich to the play-offs, in 2004 and 2005, but lost on both occasions to West Ham United in the semi-finals. Several players were subsequently sold off to Premier League sides, and Ipswich finished 15th in the 2005–06 season, their lowest finish since 1966, and Royle left the club by mutual consent.

===Later career===
In December 2006, Royle was appointed as a Patron of Trust Oldham, the official supporter&#x27;s association of Oldham Athletic. In November 2007, Royle was under serious consideration for the Leicester City and Wigan Athletic managerial roles, but decided to pull out of the running for both.

During his break from management, Royle co-commentated alongside the likes of John Helm and Tony Jones on Five&#x27;s UEFA Cup Football coverage.

On 15 March 2009, Royle was re-appointed to Oldham Athletic on a temporary basis, following the resignation of John Sheridan. In April, he was offered the job on a permanent basis, but turned it down on 28 April, and announced that he would be leaving the club after the final game. On 2 May, in his final game, and the club&#x27;s final game of the season, Royle led Oldham to a 2–1 away victory at Walsall.

On 2 June 2014, Royle joined Norwich City as a footballing consultant to new manager Neil Adams. On 14 July of the same year, Royle was appointed to help oversee the youth development at Everton, alongside David Unsworth. On 12 May 2016, following the departure of Roberto Martinez, Royle assisted Unsworth in taking charge of Everton&#x27;s final game of the season against Norwich.

In October 2018, Royle was appointed as a director at Wigan Athletic, following the club&#x27;s takeover.

In July 2022, Royle has been appointed as the director of Oldham Athletic after its takeover from the previous owners.

<doc id="1285650" wikidata="Q193027" url="?curid=1285650" title="Mawlid">
<text>Mawlid (), also known as Eid-e-Milad an-Nabi (Arabic: عید ميلاد النبي, &quot;ʿīd mīlad an-nabī&quot;, &#x27;feast of the birth of the prophet&#x27;), is an annual festival commemorating the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad on the traditional date of 12 Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal, the third month of the Islamic calendar. A day central to the traditions of Sunni Islam, the Mawlid is also celebrated by Shia Muslims.

The history of this celebration goes back to the early days of Islam when some of the Tabi‘un began to hold sessions in which poetry and songs composed to honour Muhammad were recited and sung to crowds in the major cities. 
The celebration was continued either by the Abbasids and the Fatimids. The Muslim general Gökböri, a deputy of Saladin (), is believed to have been the first to publicly celebrate Mawlid, which he did in an impressive ceremony at the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina. The Ottomans under Murad III () declared it an official holiday.

Celebrants hold on Mawlid in which religious poetry is recited in praise of Muhammad accompanied by a feast. Other customs affiliated with Mawlid are supererogatory fasting, Islamic music and . Most denominations of Islam approve of the commemoration of Muhammad&#x27;s birthday. 

The Mawlid observance is generally approved of across the four Sunni schools of law, by mainstream Islamic scholarship and it is a recognized national holiday in most of the Muslim-majority countries of the world.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the Arabic root word , meaning &quot;to give birth&quot; or &quot;descendant&quot;. Although it is a generic term for any day of birth, usually refers to the observance of the birthday of Muhammad.

Along with being referred to as the celebration of the birth of Muhammad, the term Mawlid refers to the &#x27;text especially composed for and recited at Muhammad&#x27;s nativity celebration&#x27; or &quot;a text recited or sung on that day&quot;. It is also known as ().

==Date==
According to the majority of Sunni Muslims and most Shias, Muhammad was born on the 12th of Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal. Many Twelver Shia Muslims on the other hand assert that Muhammad was born on the 17th of Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal. It stands as a matter of &quot;ikhtilaf&quot; or disagreement since prominent Shia scholars such as Muhammad ibn Ya&#x27;qub al-Kulayni, Ibn Babawayh, and Zayn al-Din al-Juba&#x27;i al-&#x27;Amili have affirmed the date of the 12th of Rabi&#x27; al-Awal. Nonetheless, others contend that the date of Muhammad&#x27;s birth is unknown and is not definitively recorded in the Islamic traditions. The issue of the correct date of the Mawlid is recorded by Ibn Khallikan as constituting the first proven disagreement concerning the celebration.

== History ==
The history of this celebration goes back to the early days of Islam when some of the Tabi‘un began to hold sessions in which poetry and songs composed to honour Muhammad were recited and sung to crowds in the major cities. The Ottomans declared it an official holiday in 1588, known as &quot;Mevlid Kandil&quot;. The term &quot;Mawlid&quot; is also used in some parts of the world, such as Egypt, as a generic term for the birthday celebrations of other historical religious figures such as Sufi saints.

In early days of Islam, observation of Muhammad&#x27;s birth as a holy day was usually arranged privately and later was an increased number of visitors to the Mawlid house that was open for the whole day specifically for this celebration. The history of this celebration goes back to the early days of Islam when some of the Tabi‘un began to hold sessions in which poetry and songs composed to honour Muhammad were recited and sung to the crowds.

The early celebrations, included elements of Sufi influence, with animal sacrifices and torchlight processions along with public sermons and a feast. The celebrations occurred during the day, in contrast to modern day observances, with the ruler playing a key role in the ceremonies. Emphasis was given to the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; with presentation of sermons and recitations of the Qur&#x27;an.

The exact origins of the Mawlid is difficult to trace. According to &quot;Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God&quot;, the significance of the event was established when Muhammad fasted on Monday, citing the reason for this was his birth on that day, and when Umar took into consideration Muhammad&#x27;s birth as a possible starting time for the Islamic calendar. According to &quot;Festivals in World Religions&quot;, the Mawlid was first introduced by the Abbasids in Baghdad. It has been suggested that the Mawlid was first formalized by al-Khayzuran of the Abbasids. Ibn Jubayr, in 1183, writes that Muhammad&#x27;s day of birth was celebrated every Monday of Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal at his birthplace, which had been converted into a place of devotion under the Abbasids.

According to the hypothesis of Nico Kaptein of Leiden University, the Mawlid was initiated by the Fatimids. It has been stated, &quot;The idea that the celebration of the &quot;mawlid&quot; originated with the Fatimid dynasty has today been almost universally accepted among both religious polemicists and secular scholars.&quot; Annemarie Schimmel also says that the tendency to celebrate the memory of Muhammad&#x27;s day of birth on a larger and more festive scale emerged first in Egypt during the Fatimids. The Egyptian historian Maqrizi (d. 1442) describes one such celebration held in 1122 as an occasion in which mainly scholars and religious establishment participated. They listened to sermons, distributed sweets, particularly honey, Muhammad&#x27;s favourite and the poor received alms. This Shia origin is frequently noted by those Sunnis who oppose Mawlid. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, however, what the Fatimids did was simply a procession of court officials, which did not involve the public but was restricted to the court of the Fatimid caliph. Therefore, it has been concluded that the first Mawlid celebration which was a public festival was started by Sunnis in 1207 by Muẓaffar al-Dīn Gökburi.

It has been suggested that the celebration was introduced into the city Ceuta by Abu al-Abbas al-Azafi as a way of strengthening the Muslim community and to counteract Christian festivals.

===Start of a public holiday===
In 1207, the Turkic general Gökböri started the first annual public festival of the Mawlid in Erbil. Gökböri was the brother-in-law of Saladin and soon the festival began to spread across the Muslim world. Since Saladin and Gokburi were both Sufis the festival became increasingly popular among Sufi devotees which remains so till this day. The Ottomans declared it an official holiday in 1588, known as &quot;Mevlid Kandil&quot;. It is a national holiday in most parts of the Muslim world except Saudi Arabia and Qatar which are officially Salafi. 

==Observances==
===Where===
Mawlid is celebrated in almost all Islamic countries, and in other countries that have a significant Muslim population, such as Ethiopia, India, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Nigeria, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Iraq, Iran, Maldives, Morocco, Jordan, Libya, Russia and Canada. Hari Maulaud Nabi is a public holiday in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

In the last decades of the late 20th century there has been a trend to &quot;forbid or discredit&quot; Mawlid because of the rise of Salafism.

===Sunni celebration===
The first Sunni mawlid celebration that we have a detailed description of was sponsored by Saladin&#x27;s general, Muzaffar al-Din Kokburi (Gökböri) and included the slaughtering of thousands of animals for a banquet which is believed to have cost 300,000 dirhams.

The presence of guests and the distribution of monetary gifts at &quot;mawlid&quot; festivals had an important social function as they symbolized &quot;concretizing ties of patronage and dramatizing the benevolence of the ruler&quot; and also held religious significance, as &quot;issues of spending and feeding were pivotal both to the religious and social function of the celebration.&quot; Often organized in some countries by the Sunni Sufi orders, Mawlid is celebrated in a carnival manner, large street processions are held and homes or mosques are decorated. Charity and food is distributed, and stories about the life of Muhammad are narrated with recitation of poetry by children. Scholars and poets celebrate by reciting Qaṣīda al-Burda Sharif, the famous poem by 13th-century Arabic Sufi Busiri. A general Mawlid appears as &quot;a chaotic, incoherent spectacle, where numerous events happen simultaneously, all held together only by the common festive time and space&quot;. These celebrations are often considered an expression of the Sufi concept of the pre-existence of Muhammad. However, the main significance of these festivities is expression of love for Muhammad.
===Theological pros and cons===

Early &quot;fatwas&quot; and criticisms of the &quot;mawlid&quot; have taken issue with the &quot;possibility of coerced giving&quot; as hosts often took monetary contributions from their guests for festival costs.

Jurists often conceptualized the observance of Muhammad&#x27;s day of birth as a &quot;form of reciprocation for God&#x27;s bestowal of the Prophet Muhammad&quot; as a way of justifying celebrations. According to this thought, the bestowal of such a gift required thanks, which came in the form of the celebration of the &quot;mawlid&quot;. Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (1392 CE) and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalini (1449 CE) both expressed such ideas, specifically referencing the hadith about the Jews and the fast of ‘Ashura’, but broadening the conception of &quot;thanks to God&quot; to multiple forms of worship including prostration, fasting, almsgiving, and Qur’anic recitation. The only limitation Ibn Hajar places on forms of celebration is that they must be neutral under Shari’a.

===By country===
Yemen

In Yemen, Mawlid al-Nabi, the celebration of Muhammad&#x27;s birthday, is one of the most significant events of the year and is home to the largest Mawlid gathering in the world. In cities like Sana&#x27;a and other major urban centers, millions gather to mark the occasion with religious ceremonies, poetry recitations, and large processions, creating a deeply spiritual atmosphere. The color green, the Prophet&#x27;s favorite color, is prominently worn by many, symbolizing life, renewal, and a connection to his legacy. Streets, mosques, and homes are adorned with green decorations and lights, further enhancing the festive mood. The event is not only a religious observance but also a reflection of Yemen’s strong cultural and historical ties to the Prophet’s life and teachings. 

====Pakistan====
During Pakistan&#x27;s Mawlid, the day starts with a 31-gun salute in federal capital and a 21-gun salute at the provincial capitals and religious hymns are sung during the day.

====Indonesia====
In many parts of Indonesia, the celebration of the &quot;Mawlid al-nabi&quot; &quot;seems to surpass in importance, liveliness, and splendour&quot; the two official Islamic holidays of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.

====Tunisia====
In Qayrawan, Tunisia, Muslims sing and chant hymns of praise to Muhammad, welcoming him in honor of his birth. Also, generally in Tunisia, people usually prepare Assidat Zgougou to celebrate the Mawlid.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, Mawlid is widely celebrated. It is referred to as &quot;Mevlid Kandili&quot; in Turkish, which means &quot;the candle feast for the Prophet&#x27;s day of birth&quot;. Traditional poems regarding Muhammad&#x27;s life are recited both in public mosques and at home in the evening. The most celebrated of these is the Mawlid of Süleyman Çelebi. Plenty of other mawlids were written in Ottoman times.

====India====

Among non-Muslim countries, India is noted for its Mawlid festivities. The relics of Muhammad are displayed after the morning prayers in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir at the Hazratbal Shrine, where night-long prayers are also held. Hyderabad Telangana is noted for its grand milad festivities. Religious meetings, night-long prayers, rallies, parades and decorations are made throughout the city and schools declare holiday.

=== The prophet himself ===
According to Sahih Muslim, the prophet fasted on his own birthday, which is why some Muslims also observe that fact and fast the day. 

==Mawlid texts==
Along with being referred to as the celebration of the birth of Muhammad, the term Mawlid also refers to the &#x27;text especially composed for and recited at Muhammad&#x27;s nativity celebration&#x27; or &quot;a text recited or sung on that day&quot;. Such poems have been written in many languages, including Arabic, Kurdish and Turkish. These texts contain stories of the life of Muhammad, or at least some of the following chapters from his life, briefly summarized below:

# The Ancestors of Muhammad
# The Conception of Muhammad
# The Birth of Muhammad
# Introduction of Halima
# Life of Young Muhammad in Bedouins
# Muhammad&#x27;s orphanhood
# Abu Talib&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s first caravan trip
# Arrangement of Marriage between Muhammad and Khadija
# Al-Isra&#x27;
# Al-Mi&#x27;radj, or the Ascension to heaven
# Al-Hira, first revelation
# The first converts to Islam
# The Hijra
# Muhammad&#x27;s death

These text are only part of the ceremonies. There are many different ways that people celebrate Mawlid, depending on where they are from. There appears to be a cultural influence upon what kind of festivities are a part of the Mawlid celebration. In Indonesia, it is common the congregation recite Simthud Durar, especially among Arab Indonesians.

==Permissibility==
Among Muslim scholars, the legality of Mawlid &quot;has been the subject of intense debate&quot; and has been described as &quot;perhaps one of the most polemical discussions in Islamic law&quot;. Traditionally, most Sunni and nearly all of the Shia scholars have approved the celebration of Mawlid, while Salafi and Deobandi scholars oppose the celebration.

===Support===
Examples of historic Sunni scholars who permitted the Mawlid include the Shafi&#x27;i scholar Al-Suyuti (d 911 A.H.). He was a scholar who wrote a fatwa on the Mawlid, which became one of the most important texts on this issue. Although he became famous outside of Egypt, he was caught in conflicts in Egypt his entire life. For example, he believed that he was the most important scholar of his time, and that he should be regarded as a mujtahid (a scholar who independently interprets and develops the Law) and later as a mujaddid (a scholar who appears at end of a century to restore Islam). These claims made him the most controversial person of his time. However, his fatwa may have received widespread approval and may not have provoked any conflicts.

He stated that:&quot;My answer is that the legal status of the observance of the Mawlid – as long as it just consists of a meeting together by the people, a recitation of apposite parts of the Qur&#x27;an, the recounting of transmitted accounts of the beginning of (the biography of) the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – and the wonders that took place during his birth, all of which is then followed by a banquet that is served to them and from which they eat-is a good innovation (bid&#x27;a hasana), for which one is rewarded because of the esteem shown for the position of the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – that is implicit in it, and because of the expression of joy and happiness on his – may God bless him and grant him peace – noble birth.&quot;Al-Suyuti thought that the Mawlid could be based on the fact that Muhammad performed the sacrifice for his own birth after his calling to be a prophet. He said that Abu Lahab, who he called an unbeliever, had been condemned by what was revealed in the Quran but was rewarded in the fire &quot;for the joy he showed on the night of the birth of the Prophet&quot; by releasing from slavery Thuwayba when she had informed him of the birth of Muhammad. Therefore, he talked about what would happen to a Muslim who rejoiced in his birth and loved him.

In response to al-Fakihani, al-Suyuti said a few things. He said that &quot;because a matter is not known it does not necessarily follow that the matter does not exist nor ever has existed.&quot; He also said that a &quot;learned and judicious ruler introduced it,&quot; in responding to al-Fakihani&#x27;s statement that &quot;on the contrary, it is a bida that was introduced by idlers... nor the pious scholars...&quot; Al-Suyuti also said in response to &quot;Nor is it meritorious, because the essence of the meritorious is what the Law demands,&quot; that &quot;the demands of meritorious are sometimes based on a text and sometimes on reasoning by analogy.&quot; Al-Suyuti said that bidas are not restricted to forbidden or reprehensible, but also to the permitted, meritorious, or compulsory categories in response to al-Fakihani&#x27;s statement that &quot;according to the consensus of the Muslims innovation in religion is not permitted.&quot; In response to al-Fakihani&#x27;s statement that &quot;This, not withstanding the fact that the month in which he… is born namely Rabi&#x27;I, is exactly the same as the one in which he died. Therefore joy and happiness in this month are not any more appropriate than sadness in this month,&quot; al-Suyuti said that &quot;birth is the greatest benefaction which has ever befallen us, but his death the greatest calamity that has been visited upon us.&quot; He said that the law allows expression of gratitude for benefactions, and that Muhammad had prescribed the sacrifice after the birth of a child because this would express gratitude and happiness for the newborn. Indeed, al-Suyuti said that the principles of the law say it is right to express happiness at Muhammad&#x27;s birth.

The Shafi&#x27;i scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani () too approved of the Mawlid and states that:&quot;As for what is performed on the day of the Mawlid, one should limit oneself to what expresses thanks to God, such as the things that have already been mentioned: [Qur&#x27;anic] recitation, serving food, alms-giving, and recitation of praise [poems] about the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – and asceticism which motivate people to perform good deeds and act in view of the next world.&quot;

The Damascene Shafi&#x27;i scholar Abu Shama () (who was a teacher of Imam al-Nawawi ()) also supports the celebration of the Mawlid. The Maliki scholar Ibn al-Hajj () also spoke positively of the observance of the Mawlid in his book &quot;al-Madhkal&quot;. Al-Hajj addresses his thoughts on the paradoxical problem of misguided Mawlid observance when he says:

&quot; This is a night of exceeding virtue and what follows from an increase in virtue is an increase in the thanks that it merits through the performance of acts of obedience and the like. [However], some people, instead of increasing thanks, have increased innovations on it.&quot;

Likewise, the Shafi&#x27;i Egyptian scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami () was an avid supporter of the Mawlid and wrote a text in praise of it. This was supported and commented on by the Egyptian scholar and former head of Al-Azhar University Ibrahim al-Bajuri and by the Hanafi Syrian Mufti Ibn Abidin. Another Hanafi Mufti Ali al-Qari () too supported the celebration of the Mawlid and wrote a text on the subject as did the Moroccan Maliki scholar Muḥammad ibn Jaʿfar al-Kattānī (). Ibn al-Jazari (), a Syrian Shafi&#x27;i scholar considers the celebration of the Mawlid to be a means of gaining Paradise.

In the Muslim world, the majority of Sunni Islamic scholars are in favor of the Mawlid. &quot;In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the celebration of the Prophet&#x27;s (s) birthday and the recitation of mawlid texts were ubiquitous practices endorsed by the majority of mainstream Sunni scholars... by the modern period the celebration of the Mawlid was overwhelmingly accepted and practiced at all levels of religious education and authority. Prominent elite scholars continued to contribute to the development of the tradition.&quot; Examples include the former Grand Mufi of Egypt Ali Gomaa, Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki of Saudi Arabia, Yusuf al-Qaradawi the primary scholar of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, Habib Ali al-Jifri, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, Muhammad bin Yahya al-Ninowy of Syria, president of the Heritage and History Committee of the United Arab Emirates Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Khazraji and Zaid Shakir, all of whom subscribe to Sunni Islam, have given their approval for the observance of Mawlid.

===Opposition===
Salafism sects represented in Saudi Arabia and Qatar does not celebrate mawlid while Deobandi sect also forbids its observance though some of their scholars participate in Mawlid gatherings.
Established in 31 May 1866 in India, Wahabi/Salafi influenced Deoband Madarsa and its Deobandi sect consider Mawlid un Nabi as Biddah.
However, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, scholars wing of Deobandism celebrate Mawlid in Kanpur city of Uttar Pradesh, India by bringing out 
procession since 1913 and also takes part in Mawlid celebrations in Aligarh Muslim University which is organized ever year under Seerat Committee. One of the Deobandi scholar who regularly delivers mawlid speeches in Aligarh Muslim University, India Prof. Qasmi (Dean, Faculty of Theology, AMU) told that Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi functions have been organized at MAO College/Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) since the times of its founder. 

Taj al-Din al-Fakihani (), an Egyptian Maliki, considered Mawlid to be a blameworthy innovation that was either makruh or haram. Al-Fakihani said that there was no basis of this in the Book of God, nor in the sunnah of Muhammad, and that there was no observance of it on authority of scholars of the umma. He said that it was a &quot;bida that was introduced by idlers, and a delight to which gluttons abandon themselves.&quot; He mentioned how the five legal categories included whether it is compulsory, meritorious, permitted, reprehensible, or forbidden. He said it was not compulsory, meritorious, or permitted, and therefore it was reprehensible or forbidden. He said that it was reprehensible when a person observed at their own expense without doing more at the gathering than to eat and abstain from doing anything sinful. The second condition of the category of forbidden, according to al-Fakihani, was when committing of transgressions entered into the practice, such as &quot;singing–with full bellies–accompanied by instruments of idleness like drums and reed flutes, with the meeting of men with young boys and male persons with attractive women–either mixing with them or guarding them–, just like dancing by swinging and swaying, wallowing in lust and forgetting of the Day of Doom.&quot; He also said, &quot;And likewise the women, when they come together and there lend their high voices during the reciting with sighing and singing and thereby during the declaiming and reciting disobey the law and neglect His word: ‘Verily, your Lord is on a watchtower’ (Sura 89:14).&quot; He further said, &quot;Nobody with civilized and courteous manners approves of this. It is only pleasing to people whose hearts are dead and do not contain few sins and offenses.&quot; Finally, he said that the month when Muhammad was born was also the month in which he died, and so implied that joy and happiness in that month are not more appropriate than sadness in that month.

Fellow Egyptian Maliki Ibn al-Haj al-Abdari also considered Mawlid as a blameworthy innovation that was either makruh or haram, who added that the celebration was never practiced by the Salaf. However Ibn al-Haj affirms the auspicious qualities of the month of the Mawlid in the most effusive terms. and considers Muhammad&#x27;s date of birth as a particularly blessed time of the year. The Maliki scholar al-Shatibi considered Mawlid an illegitimate innovation. The Andalusian jurist Abu &#x27;Abd Allah al-Haffar () opposed Mawlid, noting that had the Sahaba celebrated it then its exact date would not be a matter of uncertainty. The former grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Baz, along with Hammud ibn &#x27;Abd Allah al-Tuwayjiri (), another Saudi scholar, in their opposition also argued that there were many worthy occasions in Muhammad&#x27;s life which he never commemorated, such as the revelation of the first verses of the Qur&#x27;an, the Night Journey and the hijra.

===Ambiguity===
The position of Ibn Taymiyya (1263–1328) on the Mawlid has been ambiguous. On the one hand, he considered that it was a reprehensible devotional innovation and criticised those who celebrated the Mawlid out of a desire to imitate the Christian celebration of Jesus&#x27;s day of birth. On the other hand, he recognised that some observe Muhammad&#x27;s day of birth out of a desire to show their love and reverence of him and thus deserve a great reward for their good intentions. The Salafi writer Hamid al-Fiqi () criticised Ibn Taymiyya for holding this view and stating that &quot;How can they receive a reward for this when they are opposing the guidance of God&#x27;s Messenger (pbuh)?&quot;.

Ibn al-Hajj (c. 1250/56-1336) praised carrying out ceremonies and expression of gratitude during the festival, but rejected the forbidden and objectionable matters that took place at it. He objected to certain things, such as singers performing to the accompaniment of percussion instruments, pointing to their blameworthiness. He asked about what connections there might have been between percussion instruments and the month of Muhammad&#x27;s day of birth. However, he said that it was right to honor and distinguish the day of birth because it showed respect for the month. He also said that excellence lied in devotional acts. Therefore, al-Hajj said that &quot;the respect of this noble month should consist of additional righteous works, the giving of alms and other pious deeds. If anybody is not able to do so, let him then in any case avoid what is forbidden and reprehensible out of respect for this noble month.&quot; He said that even though the Quran might be recited, the people actually were &quot;longing for the most skilled adepts of folly and stimulating means to entertain the people,&quot; and said that this was &quot;perverse&quot;. Therefore, he did not condemn the Mawlid, but only &quot;the forbidden and objectionable things which the Mawlid brings in its wake.&quot; He did not disapprove of preparing a banquet and inviting people to participate. In addition, Ibn al-Hajj also said that people observed the Mawlid not just from reasons of respect but also because they wanted to get back the silver they had given on other joyous occasions and festivals, and said that there were &quot;evil aspects&quot; attached to this.

Skaykh al-Islam, Abu I-Fadl ibn Hajar, who was &quot;the (greatest) hafiz of this time,&quot; said that the legal status of the Mawlid was that it was a bida, which was not transmitted on the authority of one of the pious ancestors. However, he said that it comprised both good things, as well as the reverse, and that if one strove for good things in practicing it and evaded bad things, the Mawlid was a good innovation, and if not, then not. He said that the coming of Muhammad was a good benefaction, and said that only the day ought to be observed. He said that &quot;it is necessary that one restricts oneself to that which expresses gratitude to God… namely by reciting the Quran, the giving of a banquet, almsgiving, declamations of some songs of praise for the Prophet and some ascetic songs of praise, which stimulate the hearts to do good and to make efforts to strive for the Hereafter.&quot; He also said that the &quot;sama and the entertainment and the like&quot; may have been in line with the joyous nature of the day, but said that “what is forbidden or reprehensible, is, of course, prohibited. The same holds true for what is contrary to that which is regarded as the most appropriate.&quot;

==Other uses==
In some countries, such as Egypt and Sudan, Mawlid is used as a generic term for the celebration of the day of birth of local Sufi saints and not only restricted to the observance of the birth of Muhammad. Around 3,000 Mawlid celebrations are held each year. These festivals attract an international audience, with the largest one in Egypt attracting up to three million people honouring Ahmad al-Badawi, a local 13th-century Sufi saint.

<doc id="1285662" wikidata="Q622059" url="?curid=1285662" title="April Uprising of 1876">
<text>The April Uprising () was an insurrection organised by the Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire from April to May 1876. The rebellion was suppressed by irregular Ottoman bashi-bazouk units that engaged in indiscriminate slaughter of both rebels and non-combatants (see Batak massacre).

The American community around Robert College in Istanbul, the Protestant mission in Plovdiv headed by J.F. Clarke as well as two other Americans, journalist Januarius MacGahan and diplomat Eugene Schuyler, were indispensable in bringing knowledge of Ottoman atrocities to the wider European public.

Their reports of the events, which came to be known in the press as the Bulgarian Horrors and the Crime of the Century, caused a public outcry across Europe and mobilised both common folks and famous intellectuals to demand a reform of the failed Ottoman model of governance of the Bulgarian lands.

The shift in public opinion, in particular, in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s hitherto closest ally, the British Empire, eventually led to the re-establishment of a separate Bulgarian state in 1878.

==Background==

In Europe, in the 18th century, the classic non-national states were the &quot;multi-ethnic empires&quot; such as the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose population belonged to many ethnic groups and spoke many languages. The idea of nation state became more prominent during the 19th century. The most noticeable characteristic was the degree to which nation states used the state as an instrument of &quot;national unity&quot; in economic, social and cultural life. By the 18th century, the Ottomans had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in science, technology, and industry. However, the Bulgarian population was also suppressed socially and politically under Ottoman rule. Additionally, more immediate causes for the greater mobilisation compared to earlier revolts were the severe internal and external problems which the Ottoman Empire experienced in the middle of the 1870s. In 1875, taxes levied on non-Muslims were raised for fear of state bankruptcy, which, in turn, caused additional tension between Muslims and Christians and led to the Herzegovinian rebellion and the Stara Zagora revolt in Bulgaria. The failure of the Ottomans to handle the Herzegovinian uprising successfully showed the weakness of the Ottoman state, and the atrocities committed during its suppression discredited it internationally. In the late 19th century, European ideas of nationalism were adopted by the Bulgarian elite.

==Preparation==
In November 1875, activists of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee met in the Romanian town of Giurgiu and decided that the political situation was suitable for a general uprising. The uprising was scheduled for April or May 1876. The territory of the country was divided into five revolutionary districts with centers in Vratsa (leader-Stoyan Zaimov), Veliko Tarnovo (Stefan Stambolov), Sliven (Ilarion Dragostinov), Plovdiv (Panayot Volov—who later gave his position to his assistant Georgi Benkovski) and Sofia (Nikola Obretenov).

The rebels had been hoarding arms and ammunition for some time and even constructed a makeshift cannon out of cherry-wood.

In the progress of the preparation of the uprising, the organisers gave up the idea of a fifth revolutionary district in Sofia due to the deplorable situation of the local revolutionary committees and moved the centre of the fourth revolutionary district from Plovdiv to Panagyurishte. On 14 April 1876, a general meeting of the committees from the fourth revolutionary district was held in the Oborishte locality near Panagyurishte to discuss the proclamation of the insurrection. However, one of the delegates disclosed the plot to the Ottoman authorities. As a result, the Ottoman police made an attempt to arrest the leader of the local revolutionary committee in Koprivshtitsa, Todor Kableshkov on .

The Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee&#x27;s minutes from 17th of April 1876 chaired by Benkovski discuss retaliation against the Turkish and Muslim population in mixed regions opposing the uprising. These actions include killing, arson of property and homes and seizure of assets. On the other hand, Muslims who did not resist were to be protected in the same way as the Bulgarian population. The committee also gave approval for torching towns and villages. However, there is no evidence that this plan was implemented.

==Outbreak and suppression==

In conformity with the decisions taken at Oborishte, the local rebel committee attacked and surrounded the headquarters of the Ottoman police in Koprivshtitsa on 20 April 1876. At least two Ottoman police officers were killed, and the commander, Necip Aga, was forced to release arrested rebel suspects. Necip Aga and his close officials managed to escape the siege. However, due to this incident, the Bulgarian rebels had to proclaim the insurrection two weeks in advance of the planned date. 

Within several days, the rebellion spread to the entire Sredna Gora and to a number of towns and villages in the northwestern Rhodopes. The insurrection broke out in the other revolutionary districts, though on a much smaller scale. The areas of Gabrovo, Tryavna, and Pavlikeni also revolted in force, along with several villages north and south of Sliven and near Berovo (in present-day North Macedonia).

The Ottoman response was immediate and severe. Irregular &quot;bashi-bazouks&quot;, sometimes accompanied by army detachments, were swiftly mobilized. These forces attacked the first insurgent towns as early as 25 April. The Ottomans massacred civilian populations, the principal places being Panagurishte, Perushtitza, Klisura, and Batak (see Batak massacre). By the middle of May, the insurrection was completely suppressed. One of the last sparks of resistance was poet Hristo Botev&#x27;s attempt to come to the rebels&#x27; rescue with a detachment of Bulgarian political émigrés resident in Romania, which ended with the unit&#x27;s rout and Botev&#x27;s death.

Nevertheless, a unit of Circassian paramilitaries managed to commit a final atrocity well after the end of hostilities. They butchered 145 non-combatants at Boyadzhik after confusing the preparation for a Bulgarian holiday with a rebellion in the making.

The Porte&#x27;s refusal to send additional regular army detachments, and the decision of the Beys of Edirne and Filibe to instead arm bashi-bazouk forces greatly determined the number of casualties and the aftermath of the uprising&#x27;s suppression. Thus, the village of Bratsigovo, which was one of the best prepared centres of the rebellion and managed to fiercely resist enemy attacks for days, suffered only 250 casualties, very few of whom civilian, after fighting a regular Ottoman army unit. The leader of the Bratsigovo resistance, , also assumed all blame for what had happened. By contrast, Perushtitza, Panagurishte and Batak, which faced bashi-bazouk forces, all suffered enormous casualties, estimated by Schuyler at approx. 1,000, 3,000 and 5,000, respectively.

Schuyler qualified the uprising as poorly prepared and undeserving of the brutality of the Ottoman response. Modern Bulgarian historiography also calls it premature and poorly prepared and considers that the organisers only wanted to draw European and Russian public attention to the plight of Ottoman Bulgarians, with no illusions that the revolt would succeed. 

In view of the poor preparation of the insurgents, but the enormous repercussions of their deeds, American Protestant missionary and author Henry Otis Dwight called the revolt &quot;the maddest freak that ever led men to death&quot;.

==Casualties==
The most detailed contemporary account of the uprising was prepared by American diplomat Eugene Schuyler. He learned about the events from faculty members at Robert College, who feared that the coming investigation of Englishman Walter Baring would turn into a cover-up because of the British Empire&#x27;s strongly pro-Ottoman official stance and his own reputation as a Turkophile.

After visiting 3 cities and 11 villages, Schuyler compiled a report detailing the burning of sixty-five villages, the demolition of five monasteries and the slaughter of at least 15,000 people—rebels and non-combatants alike. However, what Schuyler emphasised the most was the exceptional, highly unnecessary brutality employed, in particular, at Batak. Eventually, despite his reputation as a Turkophile, Baring by and large confirmed Schuyler&#x27;s findings. The report of his investigation only reduced the estimated number of victims to 12,000.

Januarius MacGahan also put the number of Bulgarian casualties at 15,000, with the reservation that the figure does not cover the insurrection north of the Balkan. Subsequent investigations by the French and Russian Consuls estimated the number of Bulgarian casualties at 25,000–40,000. In mid-June 1876, Turkish sources claimed some 18,000 casualties, and Bulgarian ones 30,000.

According to Baring, the civilian Muslim population was not materially affected by the rebellion. This is also substantiated in the reports of Eugene Schuyler and James F. Clarke, who testify that very few peaceful Muslims were killed. According to Schuyler, Muslim casualties numbered 115, of whom 12 women and children. Ottoman officials at the time claimed approx. 500 Muslim casualties.

While contemporary witnesses are unanimous on the scale of destruction of human life and property among the rebels and agree that there were few Muslim casualties, there is disagreement on both issues among modern Western historians. Some of them not only take issue with the number of Muslim victims but also disparage or negate Bulgarian casualties. 

Thus, American historian Justin McCarthy claims that more than 1,000 Muslims were slaughtered and many more expelled during the revolt, while putting Bulgarian casualties at 3,000–12,000. He also stresses that Russian atrocities against Muslims during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 were far worse than those against insurgent Bulgarians. In &quot;History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey&quot;, Stanford Shaw claims that far more Muslims than Christians were killed in the uprising. He also estimates Bulgarian casualties at fewer than 4,000. 

On the other hand, Barbara Jelavich, who admits that the beginning of the April Uprising was accompanied by a massacre of Muslim civilians, upholds Baring&#x27;s estimate of 12,000 Bulgarian casualties. According to British historian Richard Shannon, the insurgents killed less than 200 Muslims, very few of whom were non-combatants.

According to the report written by Schuyler and American journalist Januarius MacGahan, the Ottoman government at the time did not claim more than 500 Muslims killed—most of whom in battle. Polish scholar Tomasz Kamusella opines that the numbers of victims may not distinguish between Orthodox Christians and Muslims, but acknowledges that there were only some 500 Muslim deaths. 

This is countered by American historian Richard Millman, who states that Schuyler visited in person only 11 of the villages he reported on, even though Schuyler himself admits that on the first page of his report. However, it is certain that Schuyler visited Batak and other towns and villages that suffered a particularly gruesome fate, e.g., Perushtitsa and Panagyurishte. Millman also claims that the accepted reality of the massacres is largely a myth.

McCarthy, Shaw and Millman all blame the accounts of Baring, MacGahan, Schuyler and Gladstone&#x27;s actions on a colonial mindset, an ingrained anti-Turkish bias, &quot;othering&quot;, preconceived ideas of Turkish barbarism and guilt or, at best, on pro-Russian leaning. McCarthy has since dedicated an entire book to the issue, where he attributes all negative perceptions of Turkey in the US to 19th century American missionaries—such as pastor James F. Clarke, who first gave an alert about the treatment of the Bulgarian rebels.

However, McCarthy, Shaw and Millman have in turn themselves been accused by fellow Western historians of being an &quot;apologist for the Turkish state&quot;, of having &quot;an indefensible bias toward the Turkish official position&quot; (McCarthy), of suffering from a &quot;Turkish-nationalist bias&quot;, of offering a &quot;vehemently anti-Armenian and Hellenophobic interpretation of modern Turkish history&quot; (Shaw), of &quot;being irredeemably pro-Turkish and pro-Disraeli&quot; (Millman), etc. multiple times throughout their careers. Most relevant in the context of the April Uprising&#x27;s casualty figures is fellow historian Hakem Al-Rustom&#x27;s critique that
&quot;Justin McCarthy is an apologist for the Turkish state and supports the official version of history, which denies the Armenian genocide. He thus might have exaggerated the number of Muslim victims in the Balkans in order to underplay the number of Armenian victims in Anatolia.&quot;

Both McCarthy and Shaw are Armenian Genocide denialists. McCarthy is also a member of, and has received grants from, the Institute of Turkish Studies.

Contemporary Bulgarian historians generally accept the number of Bulgarian casualties at the end of the uprising to be around 30,000. According to British and French figures, 12,000–15,000 Bulgarian civilians were massacred during the uprising.

==Reaction in the West==

===Press reports===

News of massacres of Bulgarians reached European embassies in Istanbul in May and June 1876 through Bulgarian students at Robert College, the American college in the city. Faculty members at Robert College wrote to the British Ambassador and to the Istanbul correspondents of &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;.


An article about the massacres in the &quot;Daily News&quot; on 23 June provoked a question in Parliament about Britain&#x27;s support for Turkey, and demands for an investigation. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli promised to conduct an investigation about what had really happened.

In July, the British Embassy in Istanbul sent a second secretary, Walter Baring, to Bulgaria to investigate the stories of atrocities. Baring did not speak Bulgarian (although he did speak Turkish) and British policy was officially pro-Turkish, so the Bulgarian community in Istanbul feared he would not report the complete story. They asked the American Consul in Istanbul, Eugene Schuyler, to conduct his own investigation.

Schuyler set off for Bulgaria on 23 July, four days after Baring. He was accompanied by a well-known American war correspondent, Januarius MacGahan, by a German correspondent, and by a Russian diplomat, Prince Aleksei Tseretelev.
Schuyler&#x27;s group spent three weeks visiting Batak and other villages where massacres had taken place. Schuyler&#x27;s official report, published in November 1876, said that fifty-eight villages in Bulgaria had been destroyed, five monasteries demolished, and fifteen thousand people in all massacred. The report was reprinted as a booklet and widely circulated in Europe.

Baring&#x27;s report to the British government about the massacres was similar but put the number of victims at about twelve thousand.

MacGahan&#x27;s vivid articles from Bulgaria moved British public opinion against Turkey. He described in particular what he had seen in the town of Batak, where five thousand of a total of seven thousand residents had been slaughtered, beheaded or burned alive by Turkish irregulars, and their bodies left in piles around the town square and the church.

===British response===
Liberal Party leader William Ewart Gladstone published a pamphlet on 6 September 1876, &quot;Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East&quot;, in which he attacked the Disraeli government for its indifference to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s violent repression of the April Uprising. Gladstone made clear his hostility focused on the Turkish people, rather than on the Muslim religion. The Turks he said:
The political impact of the reports was immediate and dramatic. As the leader of the opposition, Gladstone called upon the government to withdraw its support for Turkey.&quot;I entreat my countrymen&quot;, he wrote, &quot;upon whom far more than upon any other people in Europe it depends, to require and to insist that our government, which has been working in one direction, shall work in the other, and shall apply all its vigour to concur with the states of Europe in obtaining the extinction of the Turkish executive power in Bulgaria. Let the Turks now carry away their abuses in the only possible manner, namely, by carrying off themselves ...&quot;

Prominent Europeans, including Charles Darwin, Oscar Wilde, Victor Hugo, and Giuseppe Garibaldi, spoke against the Turkish behavior in Bulgaria. When war with Russia started in 1877, the Turkish Government asked Britain for help, but the British government refused, citing public outrage caused by the Bulgarian massacres as the reason.

=== Political affairs and propaganda ===
During the 19th century, British Empire typically supported Ottomans against their conflicts against Russian Empire, a common rival at the time, to curb its pan-Slavist and Orthodox Christian influence in Balkans. William Gladstone assumed a pro-Russian position on the conflict and was not concerned with the expansion of Russia&#x27;s power projection. In contrast, the works of Frederick Burnaby present a pro-Turkish understanding of events. To investigate the accounts of massacres in British media, Burnaby embarked on a travel through Ottoman lands; his memoirs were published under the titles &quot;A Ride to Khiva: Travels and Adventures in Central Asia&quot; (1876) and &quot;On Horseback through Asia Minor&quot; (1877). According to Burnaby, many Western accounts of atrocities were exaggerated and sometimes fabricated and atrocities against Muslims were omitted from the press reports. The landlord of Burnaby in Ankara complains to him about this as such,

Burnaby&#x27;s goal was to present a counter-narrative to the general Russophile attitude in Britain. According to Turkish historian Sinan Akıllı, his attempts manifested mixed results and were only partially successful in reversing the public opinion.

===Aftermath===

The April uprising was not successful in itself, but its bloody suppression by the Ottomans caused such outrage across Europe that public opinion, even in Turcophile England, shifted, demanding a reform of the model of Ottoman governance. As a result, the Great Powers called the Constantinople Conference in December 1876, where they presented the Sultan with a combined proposal that envisaged the creation of two autonomous Bulgarian provinces, largely overlapping with the borders of the Bulgarian Exarchate. By splitting the autonomy in two and ensuring extensive international oversight of provincial affairs, the proposal reflected all of the British Empire&#x27;s wishes and allayed its fears that the provinces would become Russian puppets.

Thus, the decades-long Bulgarian struggle for self-governance and freedom appeared to finally bear fruit. And this the Bulgarians had achieved entirely by themselves—through the efforts of both clergy and the young Bulgarian bourgeoisie, which had successfully argued before and succeeded in convincing Grand Vizier Âli Pasha in the need for a separate Bulgarian church and millet, thus initiating the Bulgarian nation-building process even under foreign rule, and through the blood shed by the hothead revolutionaries who had managed to cause a seismic shift in European public opinion.

However, on 20 January 1877, Grand Vizier Midhat Pasha officially and finally rejected the autonomy proposal. Bulgarian historiography has traditionally cast the blame for the failure of the Conference on the go-to villain in modern Bulgarian history, the English. However, newer research rather indicates that the power that sabotaged the Conference was the Russian Empire itself. The Russians had already apportioned Ottoman holdings in Europe amongst themselves and Austria-Hungary by virtue of the secret Reichstadt Agreement and Budapest Convention and stood to lose the most from a Bulgarian state that was not under their control—namely, their century-old dream of controlling the Turkish Straits and having a warm-water port (a.k.a. Catherine the Great&#x27;s &quot;Greek Plan&quot;).

The date of finalisation of the Budapest Convention, 15 January 1877, mere five days before Midhat Pasha&#x27;s rejection of the autonomy proposal, and its clauses, where the Russian Empire explicitly undertakes not to create a large Slavic state but rather two small autonomous Bulgarian principalities/provinces north and south of the Balkan mountains have even caused several researchers to call the Treaty of San Stefano a &quot;trick&quot; or a &quot;charade&quot;.

Whatever the truth, the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s rejection of the autonomy proposal gave the Russians the much-desired excuse to declare war on the Ottoman Empire, while preventing the United Kingdom from interfering because of public opinion. Less than two years after the uprising, Bulgaria, or at least a part of it, would be free again.

<text>The Ávila Adobe, built in 1818 by Francisco Ávila, is the oldest standing residence in the city of Los Angeles, California. Avila Adobe is located in the &quot;paseo&quot; of historic Olvera Street, a part of the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District, a California State Historic Park. The building itself is registered as California Historical Landmark #145, while the entire historic district is listed both on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

The Plaza is the third location of the original Spanish settlement El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de Los Ángeles sobre el Río Porciúncula, the first two having been washed out by flooding from the swollen Río Porciúncula (Los Angeles River). The Avila Adobe was one of the settlement&#x27;s first houses to share street frontage in the Pueblo de Los Angeles of Spanish colonial Alta California.

The walls of the Avila Adobe are thick and are built from sun-baked adobe bricks. The original ceilings were high and supported by beams of cottonwood, which was available along the banks of the Los Angeles River. Though the roof appears slanted today, the original roof was flat. Tar (Spanish: &quot;brea&quot;) was brought up from the La Brea Tar Pits, located near the north boundary line of Avila&#x27;s Rancho Las Cienegas. The tar was mixed with rocks and horsehair, a common binder in exterior building material, and applied to beams of the roof as a sealant from inclement weather.

The original floor of the Avila adobe was hard-as-concrete compacted earth, which was swept several times a day to keep the surface smooth and free from loose soil. (Dirt floors were common among most early adobes.) In later years, varnished wood planks were used as flooring.

The original structure was nearly twice as long as it now appears and was L-shaped, with a wing that extended nearly to the center of Olvera Street. The rear of the house had a long porch facing the patio. Francisco tended a garden and a vineyard in the rear courtyard. The nearby &quot;Zanja Madre&quot; (literally &quot;Mother Ditch&quot;) was a main water aqueduct and irrigation ditch that brought water down to the Pueblo from the Los Angeles River and was close enough to the adobe for Francisco Avila to avail himself. Avila eventually added a wooden veranda and steps to the front of the adobe.

== Beginnings ==
Avila Adobe was originally built in 1818 in Alta California. Throughout the years, the Avila home has kept the styles similarly as to when it was originally built, even after withstanding wars and restoration. The town in which the home was built was called El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles, which is now known as the city of Los Angeles. Before the construction of the Avila home, the land was colonized by Spanish people from Sinaloa, Mexico. In the early 1800s, the town was home to ranchero families who dominated the town. Francisco Avila was a wealthy cattle rancher who was a native of Sinaloa. Francisco grazed cattle which eventually led him to begin a ranching business that grew his wealth significantly.

Over time, the home was rented to different people, and in the next century the Avila home took many other forms of use. The home was used as a hotel, housing, lodging, and as a temporary home for U.S. troops. There was a period during its first century where the Avila Adobe was left vacant and unattended. During the years of the late 1920s, the home was neglected and unwatched. The city attempted to demolish the home as it had no use. The home was then saved by Christine Sterling, who saw the home as a historical site. Sterling did not want the authenticity of the home to be destroyed, since it was one of the first homes built in Los Angeles. Sterling was able to stop the city from demolishing the home and eventually transformed it into a museum for others to learn about the history of the home. Sterling influenced the creation of the Mexican marketplace called &quot;Placita Olvera&quot;, and today the home is often visited by many tourists and locals. Olvera Street continues to provide a Mexican cultural environment that is influenced by the history of the Avila Adobe home.

==Francisco Avila==

Francisco Avila, a Californio and wealthy cattle rancher, was the grantee of Rancho Las Cienegas west of the pueblo (present day mid-Wilshire district). Avila spent his working time at the rancho where he resided during the week. On weekends, special feast days, or holidays, he came to the Pueblo where he could conduct trade business, entertain friends, families, or patrons; or prepare for services at the &quot;Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles Asistencia&quot; (church) across the plaza.

The Avila Adobe was considered gracious in its day. It had a number of spacious rooms with an ample number of windows. It served many a social gathering with the Avilas hosting these events in the large &quot;sala&quot; (parlour).

Francisco Avila would trade hides and tallow (a main ingredient in candles and soap) to acquire luxury furnishings imported from Mexico and beyond to decorate the house. French doors and window frames were ordered from Boston. These imports were brought to post-independence Mexican Alta California by ship over thousands of miles around the southern Cape Horn of South America. Avila&#x27;s wealth and trade goods allowed the purchase of fine furnishings and goods from Mexico and New England, and Asia and Europe. Avila would also trade for household goods with merchant ships anchored in San Pedro Bay or the San Diego pueblo of Mission Bay, which were carted inland by an ox-drawn &quot;carreta&quot;, a wooden bullock cart of the era.

The adobe was always ready to receive friends, family, and travelers, including the famous trailblazer, Jedediah Smith. Smith had led a group of fur trappers overland and across the Mojave Desert to southern California, and stayed at the adobe for a few days during January 1827. These were the first U.S. citizens to reach Alta California from the east via an overland route. Smith later recorded: &quot;A few families are rich in cattle and horses and mules and among these Señor [Francisco Avila] and his brother [Ygnacio Avila] are perhaps the richest.&quot;

Francisco Avila died on April 5, 1832. His widow, Encarnacion Avila, remained at the adobe until her death in 1855, though sometime after Francisco&#x27;s death she did remarry.

==During the Mexican–American War==
On May 18, 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico, the Mexican–American War, at which time the U.S. took interest in Alta California. U.S. Navy Commodore Robert F. Stockton arrived in Monterey on July 14 and declared California won over. He then proceeded to march toward Los Angeles which he took without so much as a shot being fired. But the Pueblo de Los Angeles had not capitulated so easily and revolted against the garrison of men left to police the pueblo, winning the Siege of Los Angeles. Stockton was forced to return in October via San Diego. After the Battle of San Pasqual just north of San Diego in December, which was a setback for the Americans, they marched toward Los Angeles. They became involved in the Battle of Rio San Gabriel near the San Gabriel River on January 8, 1847, which after two days quelled the Mexican resistance there. The Battle of La Mesa followed.

When news of the advancing American troops reached the Pueblo, most of the inhabitants fled, including Maria Encarnacion Avila, whose husband was not around to protect her. She went to the home of a nearby relative and left the house in charge of a young boy who had orders to leave the doors and shutters closed. On January 10, Stockton arrived with a marching band fanfare that lured the young boy outside leaving the door open. The troops passing noticed the great size of the house with its lavish furnishings and decided to take it as temporary headquarters. When hostilities ended on January 13 with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga, the troops vacated the adobe.

Avila&#x27;s youngest daughter, Francisca married Theodore Rimpau, a German native in 1850. After Encarnacion Avila died in 1855, the couple lived in the adobe until 1868. By now the structure had aged appreciably, and the Rimpaus left. Various family member rented the house over the next few years after which it became a boarding house. An 1870 earthquake damaged the structure even more, causing it to fall into ruin, and in 1928 the City of Los Angeles condemned it.

==20th-century restoration==

Christine Sterling, a non-Hispanic woman from San Francisco, who had moved to Los Angeles, had an interest in the city&#x27;s cultural history. In 1926, she began work on the project of transforming the old plaza area from a skid row ruin into a Latin-American cultural center. She enlisted the aid of Harry Chandler, the Los Angeles Times owner and publisher, who printed several articles that would generate public interest in the project and raise funds for the restoration. However, after two years the funding was failing miserably. Even though she faced a seemingly lost cause, when she learned of the 1928 condemnation of the adobe, she acted quickly to get a stay on the wrecking ball. She tracked down the owner of the building who happened to be Miss Sophia Rimpau, a member of the original family. She agreed to rent the adobe to Mrs. Sterling for a nominal amount. Sterling then went to the papers and called in reporters to cover a story on the restoration of Olvera Street and the Avila Adobe. The campaign sparked the support she needed and soon she had enough funds to buy the house.

One of Sterling&#x27;s benefactors was Florence Dodson de Shoneman, a descendant of the Californio Sepulveda family, who provided furnishings for an entire room in the adobe. The adobe underwent the necessary renovations to keep it from being demolished and Sterling pleaded with city council to rescind the condemnation order. Not only did council fulfill the request, but the chief of police provided assistance from prison inmates to help clean up the plaza area. Eventually the Avila Adobe was completely restored to its former glory. By Easter Sunday 1930, the Olvera Street Plaza was transformed from a skid row to a Mexican-style marketplace.

Christine Sterling maintained her residence at the adobe, but held it open for group and student tours. In 1953 the State of California acquired the Avila Adobe as part of the El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park. Mrs. Sterling remained in the house until her death in 1963.

The 1971 Sylmar earthquake caused major damage to the adobe, and the house was closed to tours until a $120,000 and five-year restoration could be completed. A new structure added to the rear of the building was set up as a memorial to Christine Sterling. The Adobe has now been opened to tours since 1976.

==Historic house museum==
The present adobe is a historic house museum, with seven rooms left from what used to be a much larger building. Restoration has worked to create an idea of what the original home was like. The largest room, the family room, was a general area for dining, entertainment, and social gatherings. The office room was the main business room for Francisco Avila. The &quot;sala&quot;, or living room, was reserved for special occasions such as a wedding or baptism or maybe even entertaining special guests. There were sleeping quarters for the parents and another for the children and a kitchen for food preparation that doubled as a bathing room. Cooking was done outdoors in the courtyard. Sanitation was done elsewhere outside the house. Most of the original furnishings came from other countries with which Avila traded.

The adobe consists of a generous courtyard with covered porches for each of the adobe&#x27;s areas, including stables and a workshop. A more recent archaeological find has revealed a portion of the &quot;Zanja Madre&quot; (&quot;Mother Ditch&quot;), which transported water into the pueblo via a brick-laid pipeline from the river. In the courtyard grows two grape plants.

The adobe is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and a California Historical Landmark (No. 145) and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Access===
The Avila Adobe is open for public touring and is located at East 10 Olvera Street within El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park. The park office is located at 845 N. Alameda Street, and the Visitors Information Center is at 128 Paseo de la Plaza.

== Influence on Los Angeles history ==

The Avila Adobe home is a good demonstration of the history of Los Angeles and how the city was first discovered. The city was first named El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles, but then later renamed as Los Angeles. Before the construction of the Avila home, the city was a small town with a few homes and families that consisted of cattle ranchers. The home is a key factor in understanding the cultural history of Los Angeles because although today the city contains a multiculturalism population, it once only consisted of just Hispanic people. The city was founded by Spanish colonizers in 1781, which consisted of a group of only a few people.

Although there are many historical sites in the Los Angeles area, the location of where the Avila home stands is the oldest area of Los Angeles. There is a lot that can be learned historically by visiting the home. With the naming of Olvera Street where the home stands and the creation of the Mexican market, the home preserves the historical landmark. After the war and earthquake, the home was able to preserve the original refurnished style as in the 19th century. With the help and dedication of Christine Sterling, the Avila home was able to be restored and representing an important landmark in the city&#x27;s history. What is interesting is that Avila Adobe home is not interesting because of how it came to be, but because it still exists today.

==California Historical Landmark==
California Historical Landmark Marker NO. 145 at the site reads:
*&quot;NO. 145 AVILA ADOBE - This adobe house was built ca. 1818 by Don Francisco Avila, alcalde (mayor) of Los Angeles in 1810. Used as Commodore Robert Stockton&#x27;s headquarters in 1847, it was repaired by private subscription in 1929-30 when Olvera Street was opened as a Mexican marketplace. It is the oldest existing house in Los Angeles.&quot;

<text>James V. McConnell (October 26, 1925 – April 9, 1990) was an American biologist and animal psychologist. He is most known for his research on learning and memory transfer in planarians conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. McConnell also published several science fiction short stories in the mid-1950s.

==Career==
Most of McConnell&#x27;s academic career was spent in the psychology department at the University of Michigan, where he was a professor from 1963 through his retirement in 1988. He was an unconventional scientist, setting up his own refereed journal, the &quot;Journal of Biological Psychology&quot;, which was published in tandem with the &quot;Worm Runner&#x27;s Digest&quot;, a planarian-themed humor magazine. His paper &quot;Memory transfer through cannibalism in planarians&quot;, published in the &quot;Journal of Neuropsychiatry&quot;, reported that when planarians conditioned to respond to a stimulus were ground up and fed to other planarians, the recipients learned to respond to the stimulus faster than a control group did. McConnell believed that this was evidence of a chemical basis for memory, which he identified as memory RNA. Although well publicized, his findings were not completely reproducible by other scientists and were therefore at the time completely discredited (for review, see Chapouthier, 1973).

McConnell&#x27;s work has been referred to by a scientist who hypothesized that McConnell&#x27;s results could be explained by RNA interference (Smallheiser, 2001).

McConnell originally published satirical articles alongside serious scientific articles in the &quot;Journal of Biological Psychology&quot; but received complaints that it was difficult if not impossible to tell which was which. He decided to publish the satirical &quot;Worm Runner&#x27;s Digest&quot; upside down with its cover as the back of the &quot;Journal of Biological Psychology&quot; to make it clear which articles were satire. This, he said, created problems with librarians returning the Journal to the publisher with the complaint that it was improperly bound. He was amused by this. He spent many of his evening hours in the 1960s in informal rap sessions with students in their dorms. He was prone to making provocative statements, believed that memory was chemically based and that in the future humanity would be programmed by drugs. He once commented that he would rather be &quot;a programmer than a programmee&quot;.

McConnell was one of the targets of Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber. In 1985, he suffered hearing loss when a bomb, disguised as a manuscript, was opened at his house by his research assistant Nicklaus Suino.

McConnell died of a heart attack at St. Joseph&#x27;s Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1990.

<text>The Myanmar national football team () represents Myanmar in men&#x27;s international association football and is governed by the Myanmar Football Federation.

It was known as the Burma national football team until 1989, when Burma was renamed Myanmar. During their heydays, the team finished second in the 1968 AFC Asian Cup, participated in the Summer Olympics in 1972 and in the Asian Games and having won the Asian Games twice; in 1966 and 1970, and the football event of the Southeast Asian Games on five successive occasions; in 1965, 1967, 1969, 1971 and 1973. They did not participate in any FIFA World Cup qualification for the rest of the 20th century, contributing to the downfall of the national side.

Since being renamed, Myanmar&#x27;s highest achievement has been the silver medal at 1993 Southeast Asian Games. Myanmar played its first FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 2007 in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, losing 0–7 and 0–4 to China.

==History==

=== The golden era (1948–1970s) ===
Burma participated in 1954 Asian Games and won a bronze medal, standing behind Taiwan (gold) and South Korea (silver); this was the beginning of the golden era. On the other hand, the nation was not expected to contend for a medal in the Olympic-type Asian Games. In the meantime, this delegation became the first male Burmese team to win a continental medal. Against all odds, the Burma team bettered their 1954 effort by winning the gold medal in the Asian Games, which was held at Bangkok in the mid-1960s. In that tournament, Burma beat Iran in the gold-medal game.

The 1966 Asian Games gold medal-winning squad established itself as one of the two best teams in the region as it finished as runner-up to Iran at the 1968 AFC Asian Cup after losing against Iran and drawing against Republic of China. Having won a silver medal in 1968, the men&#x27;s soccer team had a strong performance in the early 1970s as it qualified to compete in the 1972 Summer Olympics, which was held at Munich (West Germany), upon being one of the three finalists in the Asian tournament. Despite only winning against Sudan with 2–0, the Burmese players won the Fair Play Award. The following year, the nation earned its fifth consecutive Southeast Asian Games gold medal in Singapore (Kuala Lumpur 1965, Bangkok 1967, Rangoon 1969, and Kuala Lumpur 1971).

Three years before that, the national team wrote perhaps their most important chapter: they captured the continental title for the second time in a row, after the Burmese Olympic Committee sent footballers to Thailand for the 1970 Asian Games. Burma thus became the third football squad to win the Asian tournament twice. They were declared national heroes in Rangoon, the then capital of Burma, with their second consecutive gold medal in men&#x27;s soccer.

During this golden era, Burma produced many talented footballers. One among them is Suk Bahadur who is now considered as the greatest Burmese footballer of all time for his outstanding contribution to Burmese football.

Over the following years, mainly due to political problems within the country, the national side&#x27;s ability to defend its Asian title slowly faded away.

=== Decline and struggle (1970s–2010s) ===
In the later years, Burma were unable to achieve similar results like in the golden era, due to many factors. The collapse of whole Burmese football system during the rule of Ne Win and later, the junta, had a negative impact on Burmese football team. Lack of funding and poor infrastructure prevented many Burmese players to play abroad, thus leading to retirement. At the same time, the rise of Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand made Myanmar&#x27;s golden era fade away.

Despite this, Myanmar did win 2 medals: a silver medal in the 1993 Southeast Asian Games, in a loss to Thailand, and a bronze in the 2004 AFF Championship.

=== Resurgence (2010–2019) ===

Myanmar&#x27;s 2011 reforms had been a major point of turning Myanmar&#x27;s football, which had declined since 1970s. During this era, a new wave of Burmese football had arrived with the change of Myanmar&#x27;s political climate, after many years under junta&#x27;s rule.

The arrival of the German manager Gerd Zeise has been the crucial turning point in Myanmar football. The Myanmar U20 team qualified to Myanmar&#x27;s first ever FIFA tournament, the 2015 FIFA U20 World Cup after progressing to the semi-finals in the 2014 AFC U19 Championship as host. In the 2016 AFF Championship, Myanmar, once again as host, went to semi-finals, only losing to the eventual champions, Thailand.

Despite these successes, problems remain. Myanmar&#x27;s football capability has been questioned after their disastrous 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification; while at the same time, many teams in Asia have developed after many years in the shadows. Once again, Myanmar failed to qualify for 2019 AFC Asian Cup, when they suffered a tremendous 1–5 loss to Kyrgyzstan. In an effort to prepare the team for the 2018 AFF Championship, on 13 October 2018, Myanmar played an unsuccessful friendly match against Bolivia at the Thuwunna Stadium, losing 3–0. Under Antoine Hey, Myanmar also had an unsuccessful 2018 AFF Championship, when the team was knocked out at the group stage, and Hey would resign after the tournament.

Myanmar began their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification grouping with old rival Kyrgyzstan, as well as Tajikistan, Mongolia and especially powerhouse Japan. Under the guidance of the new manager Miodrag Radulović, Myanmar had a disastrous beginning when the team fell 0–1 to Mongolia away, 0–2 to Japan at home and especially a 0–7 away defeat to the Kyrgyz, causing the Montenegrin to be fired. After the defeat to Kyrgyzstan, old coach Antoine Hey returned, where he helped Myanmar to gain a shock home win 4–3 over Tajikistan before beating Mongolia 1–0 also at home to boost morale.

=== Descent (2020–2022) ===
The COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar and subsequent Myanmar protests depleted greatly the national team when many key players refused to represent Myanmar in international football citing the junta&#x27;s involvement. As for the result, Myanmar brought to Japan with half of its squad members weren&#x27;t regular starters, and suffered its worst defeat in modern era to the host 0–10, forcing Antoine Hey&#x27;s men to win their 2 remaining matches against Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan while hoping for defeats from their 2 main opponents in the same time against Japan (and even a draw or a defeat against Mongolia for Kyrgyzstan) to be among the 4 best runners-up. Having lost to Kyrgyzstan 1–8 the next match, Myanmar were officially eliminated from the World Cup and the top 2 spots in the group. Eventually, Myanmar confirmed its bottom place in the group, losing 0–4 to Tajikistan, and have to play the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.

During the 2020 AFF Championship, Singapore defeated Myanmar 3–0, with Ikhsan Fandi scoring a brace. However in the next match, Myanmar bounced back from that defeat with Than Paing and Maung Maung Lwin both scoring a goal to earn a 2–0 victory over Timor-Leste which give the team the hope of qualifying to the semi-finals. However, those hopes were made impossible after Thailand won 4–0 against Myanmar which ended a disastrous tournament after failing to defeat the Philippines in the final matchday.

Myanmar were also drawn in the group of death in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, being drawn with Kyrgyzstan,Tajikistan and also Singapore. The team failed to secure a points in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification being humiliated by Singapore 6–2, Tajikistan 4–0 and Kyrgyzstan 2–0.

The 2022 AFF Championship took place with Myanmar having friendly matches in Thailand as preparation fixtures. They won two matches against club teams, Chonburi and Samut Prakan. Despite this, they lost 6–0 to old rivals Thailand, although the opponents fielded a weaker squad. Myanmar then played their opening match against Malaysia, but although counter-attacking play was good, they lost 1–0 due to Faisal Halim&#x27;s goal and a late penalty from Win Naing Tun being saved from Malaysia&#x27;s Syihan Hazmi. In the next match, Myanmar played Singapore at the Jalan Besar Stadium, an artificial grass which cost them in addition to poor performances as the final result was 3–2 in Singapore&#x27;s favour conceding the last goal from a goalkeeper punt kick which assisted Shawal Anuar to secure the 3 points for Singapore. However, Maung Maung Lwin did score two goals in this match: one being a composed right top corner finish while the other was a first-time volley. The team&#x27;s chances of qualifying had been ruined, as they played Laos on home soil, going down 1–0 early on through Soukaphone Vongchiengkham but Kyaw Min Oo, who was having an excellent tournament scored a header, completely unmarked. Laos scored back to take the lead up to 2–1 however in the 90+6 minutes, Myanmar captain Maung Maung Lwin secured a point for Myanmar as the match ended at 2–2 which also mean that this draw confirmed the team&#x27;s elimination from the tournament. They lost 3–0 against Vietnam in their final match and they failed to registered a single win in the group stage of the AFF Championship for the first time since the 2014 edition. On 31 January 2023, Antoine Hey resigned from his position as head coach. Despite the poor results, the team can take positives away from this tournament as the playing style was praised by many fans.

=== Glimpses of hope (2023–&quot;present&quot;) ===
In March 2023, Germany head coach Michael Feichtenbeiner was tasked to lead Myanmar with positive results. With the domestic league being more active compared to last year&#x27;s competition, Myanmar fans had no reason not to be optimistic when they participated in the 2023 Tri-Nation Series tournament hosted by India. This tournament saw the big returns of Aung Thu and Nyein Chan Aung after boycotting call-ups over the coup earlier, which was seen as a surprise. Players such as Lwin Moe Aung, Hein Htet Aung and Win Naing Tun were also called up to the national squad. In the first match, the finishing cost Myanmar against a tough India side, losing 1–0 with a goal in first half stoppage time by Anirudh Thapa. In the second match against Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar midfielder Kyaw Min Oo blew a big leading chance with a penalty miss in the first half. Despite this miss, Myanmar continued to press and trouble the Kyrgyzstan defence and were eventually rewarded with a goal from Aung Thu in the 82&#x27; minute. However, they gave away a goal in the 90+6&#x27; minute from a corner kick. Despite it being a draw, this result showed the return of the winning spirit that Myanmar desperately needed during the last year. The Myanmar team had shown a significant improvement throughout the last 6 months, and it showed in the match against Kyrgyzstan.

In June 2023, Myanmar travelled to Dalian to face China and Macau in the international friendly window in which Myanmar played their first match against China but came out with a 4–0 defeat despite a strong showing in the first half. On 19 June 2023, Macau was Myanmar&#x27;s next opponent and goals from Lwin Moe Aung and Maung Maung Lwin secured a 2–0 win, Myanmar&#x27;s first win in over two years since their last win over Timor-Leste on 8 December 2021. In September 2023, Myanmar played both of their friendly match at home against Nepal which the first match resulted in a disappointing 0–0 draw, with Myanmar goalkeeper Kyaw Zin Phyo saving Anjan Bista&#x27;s penalty. In the second match, the performance significantly improved and Myanmar won 1–0 to an 86&#x27; minute goal by striker Win Naing Tun. In October 2023, Myanmar played against Macau in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification first round match at home which see them thrashing Macau 5–1 at home on 12 October 2023. Myanmar failed to produce the same performance in the second leg however, as Macau put up a strong resistance to end the game in a disappointing goalless draw; still, due to having won 5–1 in the first leg, Myanmar advanced to the second round of the qualification, where Myanmar will have to face sterner oppositions in group B, which are Syria, North Korea and Asian hegemon Japan, which had impressed greatly in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Amidst the backdrop of ongoing security crisis on home soil, notably with the kickstarting of the Operation 1027 that led to war and destruction in the country&#x27;s borderlands and glimpse of war closer to Yangon, where Myanmar team chose to base themselves, the Burmese started their campaign with a predictable 5–0 thumping in the hands of Japan, the highest-ranked team in Asia at the time, before suffering an agonising 6–1 loss to North Korea on home soil, in which Win Naing Tun scored Myanmar&#x27;s solitary goal. On 21 March 2024, Myanmar shockingly held Syria to a 1–1 draw after Soe Moe Kyaw scored the only goal for the team during the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification match, which was a surprise after Syria&#x27;s decent performance in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup earlier. Unfortunately, Myanmar could not keep up with the tempo in the return leg, losing 7–0 to Syria in a match where the Burmese were reduced to ten men after Hein Phyo Win was sent off.

On 10 October 2024, Myanmar won 2–0 in a friendly against Sri Lanka.

=== Kits ===
The Myanmar national team kit was made by FBT in a contract in effect until 2018.

<text>The Matapedia River (, ) is a river in the Matapedia Valley in the province of Quebec, Canada. It runs on from Matapedia Lake down to the village of Matapédia where it empties into the left bank of Restigouche River on the provincial border of New Brunswick.

This freshwater course forms a natural border between the administrative regions of Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. The river is a North South divide in the Notre Dame Mountains that characterize the relief of the Gaspé Peninsula. The Matapedia River basin drains an area of about . Matapedia River is often called the&quot; Salmon Capital &quot;.

From the South side of Matapedia Lake and going to the South, the route 132 along the river goes on its entire length by the East bank.

The Canadian National Railway passes South of Matapedia Lake continues on the West bank of the river in Causapscal where the bridge at South of the village made the railway cross on the East bank. 
The track then continues South on ; then passes again in the West Bank via the railway bridge located at North of the confluence of the creek Doyle. 
The railway then rest on the West bank up to the railway bridge at the confluence of the . 
From there, the last railway segment passes through the Eastern shore, up to the confluence of the Matapedia River.

==Course==

Matapedia Lake becomes Matapedia River at Amqui, where it is a meander river for a distance of approximately . It widens into an elongated lake 1 kilometre wide and long at Lac-au-Saumon before narrowing back to a river below the dam in the village of Causapscal. 
There, it joins with a major tributary, the Causapscal River, forming a pool that is renowned for its Atlantic salmon. 
From there, the river continues on until the New Brunswick border, where it empties into the Restigouche River.

The Lake Matapedia (length: ; height: ) is the head of water of the Matapedia River. This water plan is located in the municipality Matapedia Lake, in Notre Dame Mountains. Its mouth is located in the Southeast to the height of a covered bridge.

The mouth of the Lake Matapedia is located at:
* Northwest from the confluence of the Matapedia River;
* Southeast of South Coastal Gulf of Saint Lawrence;
* South of the bridge route 132 that spans on the Matane River.

From the mouth of the Matapedia Lake, Matapedia River flows over as follow:

Higher Courses of the river(segment of )

* to the Southeast, up to the bridge of the city of Amqui of route 195;
* to the Southeast, up to the highway bridge;
* to the Southeast, with a detour to the Northeast to the Northwest shore of Salmon Lake (Matapédia);
* to the Southeast, crossing the Salmon Lake (Matapédia) on its full length;
* to the Southeast, to the confluence of the Causapscal River (from the Northeast) which is located on the South side of the village of Causapscal.

Lower course of the river (segment of )

* to the South, up to the highway bridge;
* to the South, up to the highway bridge from the village of Sainte-Florence;
* Southward up to the boundary of the Assemetquagan (township);
* to the south in Assemetquagan (township), up to the highway bridge from the village of Routhierville;
* Southward, up to the confluence of the Milnikek River (from the West);

* to the Southeast, up to the confluence of the Clark Creek (from the North);
* to the Southeast, up to the bridge of the village of Saint-Alexis-de-Matapédia;
* to the Southeast, up to the confluence of the river

The confluence of the Matapedia River flows on the north bank of the Restigouche River. This confluence is located at:
* West of the bridge in Campbellton, New Brunswick, at the confluence of the Restigouche River;
* Northeast of the confluence of the Patapédia River.

==Etymology==

Its name may derive from the Mi&#x27;kmaq word &quot;matapegiag&quot;, meaning &quot;river junction&quot;, from the parts &quot;mata&quot; (junction) and &quot;pegiag&quot; (river), referring to the Matapédia River that crosses the town just before its confluence with the Restigouche River. Another source from the late nineteenth century indicates that the Mi&#x27;kmaq named the area &quot;Magabegeak&quot; which means &quot;roughly flowing&quot;. It has also been spelled many different ways over time such as &quot;Matapediach&quot;, &quot;Madapeguia&quot;&quot;, Matapeguia&quot;&quot;, Matapediac,&quot; &quot;Matakpediack,&quot; &quot;Madapeguia,&quot; &quot;Metapedia&quot;, or &quot;Matapediac&quot;.

==History==

During the river&#x27;s most productive and fertile years (generally considered to be between 1890 and 1960), it was a destination for the wealthy and famous from around the world, including Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, American presidents Nixon and Carter, British royalty, and numerous Hollywood stars.

==Economy==

The Matapedia is a world-renowned Atlantic salmon fishing river and was given the title &quot;The Fishing Capital of the World&quot; due to the abundance of large, healthy, bright salmon. The Atlantic salmon is mainly a fly fishing only, &quot;catch and release&quot; species; and salmon fishing in this area is highly regulated by the Province of Quebec, with special daily permits and licenses required. It is recommended to inquire in the village of Matapedia for information on permits and guides. Public waters are available to anglers in the upper portions of the river. Limited-access salmon fishing, generally with outfitters or guides to the most productive salmon pools is made available to the public via a special annual lottery. There are still many private fishing camps on the banks of the lower river, such as Cold Springs, Glen Emma, Runnymeade Lodge, Restigouche Salmon Club and the Tobique, most of them owned by businessmen and large corporations.

== Municipalities on watercourse ==

Matapédia River crosses the territory of these Quebec municipalities:

*Amqui (taking his source in Matapédia Lake)
*Lac-au-Saumon (where the river crosses lac au Saumon (Matapédia))
*Causapscal
*Sainte-Florence
*Routhierville
*Saint-Alexis-de-Matapédia
*Matapédia (where the river empties in Restigouche River)

== List of salmon pools ==

<text>Katharine Houghton (born Katharine Houghton Grant; March 10, 1945) is an American actress and playwright. She portrayed Joanna &quot;Joey&quot; Drayton, a white woman who brings home her black fiancé to meet her parents, in the 1967 film &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;. Katharine Hepburn, who played the mother of Houghton&#x27;s character in the film, was Houghton&#x27;s aunt. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her performance. She is also known for her role as Kanna, the grandmother of Katara and Sokka in the film &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; (2010).

==Early life==
Houghton was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the second child of Marion Hepburn and Ellsworth Grant. Houghton was named after her maternal grandmother, Connecticut suffragist and reformer Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn.

She attended Kingswood-Oxford School and Sarah Lawrence College, where she majored in philosophy. Partially influenced by her aunt, actress Katharine Hepburn, she pursued acting as a way to help alleviate her osteoarthritis. During her junior year, she began appearing in summer stock theater. In 1965, she made her Broadway debut in &quot;A Very Rich Woman&quot; and appeared in minor television roles.

==Career==
===Acting===

Houghton made her film debut in &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967) as the daughter Joanna Drayton opposite Sidney Poitier. She auditioned for the role and believed that her aunt, who was also appearing in the film, was influential in her casting. During filming, the film&#x27;s director Stanley Kramer decided her character was appearing too articulate and intelligent. He decided instead to have her character portrayed as an ordinary and sweet girl. Arthur D. Murphy, the chief film critic for &quot;Variety&quot;, praised Houghton&#x27;s performance, writing she is &quot;an attractive, talented girl who is off to a running start.&quot; Because of the interracial kiss depicted in the film, Houghton and Kramer received hate mail and death threats. 

Following &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967), Houghton became typecast as the woman in interracial relationships. However, Houghton decided to leave behind her Hollywood career due to lackluster scripts. &quot;I turned down these projects and returned to the theater,&quot; she explained. &quot;It was fate. I went on to play Hedda and Nora and Nina and Kate.&quot; Since then, she has appeared in leading roles in over 60 productions on Broadway, Off-Broadway and in regional theatres throughout the United States. In 1970, she won the Theatre World Award for her performance in the Off-Broadway play &quot;A Scent of Flowers&quot; (written by James Saunders). She returned to film acting in the 1988 comedy-drama &quot;Mr. North&quot;.

Houghton has presented lectures at venues across the country including the 2001 Fall Concert &amp; Lectures Series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at The Cosmopolitan Club in New York. She lectured at the Metropolitan Museum of Art again in June 2008, presenting &quot;Saucy Gamine, Reluctant Penitent, and Glorious Victor&quot;, a review of her aunt&#x27;s career in Hollywood as reflected in three of her films.

===Writing===
Houghton has also worked as playwright, and by 1990, she had written nine Off-Broadway and regional productions. In 1975, Houghton wrote a children&#x27;s story, &quot;The Wizard&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, which is collected in the book &quot;Two Beastly Tales&quot;, illustrated by Joan Patchen. The second story in the book is written by John Grant, Houghton&#x27;s elder brother. During the early 1980s, she wrote and starred in a one-woman show &quot;To Heaven in a Swing&quot;, detailing Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s life with her Transcendentalist father, Amos Bronson Alcott.

She also co-wrote a one-act play titled &quot;Buddha&quot;, exploring a psychological power struggle between a man and a woman. The play was subsequently published in &quot;The Best Short Plays of 1988–1989.&quot; Her musical &quot;Bookends&quot; premiered at the New Jersey Repertory Company on July 19, 2007. It is loosely inspired by rare book dealers Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine Stern, whom Houghton had met while researching Alcott. The musical&#x27;s lyrics were composed by Dianne Adams and James McDowell. It received rave notices, and garnered the theater the highest box office sales in their 11-year history. Since then, it has twice been part of The York Theatre&#x27;s Developmental Reading Series.

<text>Manchester Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre (also known as “Victoria Park Mosque”) is a mosque in Manchester, England. Sometimes referred to as Jamia Mosque, it is situated in the middle of Victoria Park, Manchester close to the Curry Mile. It plays a key role in Manchester&#x27;s Muslim community. Imam and Khateeb Hafiz Mueen ud Din Akhtar and Qari Hafiz Javed Akhtar are leaders of the mosque, but left in 2018. Qari Javed also leads taraweeh prayers in Ramadan.

The Victoria Park Mosque began as two adjacent houses, one owned by the Syrian Textile Merchants operating in Manchester since the early 1900s, and the other owned by the mainly Asian community living in the nearby areas of Rusholme and Longsight.

In 1971, the Jamiat-ul-Muslimeen, Manchester, commenced work on a purpose-built mosque in Victoria Park and the two houses were demolished and the &quot;new look&quot; Mosque took its current form. Several expansions and modifications have taken place over the years.

This mosque acts according to the teachings of the Barelwi sect of the Indian subcontinent. Subcontinent.

<text>Sendhil Mullainathan () (born c. 1973) is an American professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was a professor of Computation and Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business from 2018-2024. He is the author of &quot;&quot; (with Eldar Shafir). He was hired with tenure by Harvard in 2004 after having spent six years at MIT.

Mullainathan is a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius grant&quot; and conducts research on development economics, behavioral economics, and corporate finance. He is co-founder of Ideas 42, a non-profit organization that uses behavioral science to help solve social problems, and J-PAL, the MIT Poverty Action Lab and has made extensive academic contributions through the National Bureau of Economic Research and has also worked in government at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In May 2018, he moved from Harvard to the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, becoming the George C. Tiao Faculty Fellow. In November 2018, he received the Infosys Prize (in Social Sciences category), one of the highest monetary awards in India that recognize excellence in science and research, for his contributions to the field of economics, especially behavioral economics. In 2024, he moved back to MIT as a professor on joint appointment between the Department of Economics and the School of Engineering. 

==Early life and career==
Born in a small farming village in Tamil Nadu, India, Mullainathan moved to the Los Angeles area in 1980. His father studied and later worked in aerospace engineering. As security clearance laws in the US aerospace industry were tightened in the 1980s, his father lost his job. His parents subsequently operated a video store.

He received his B.A. in computer science, mathematics, and economics from Cornell University in 1993 and he completed his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University 1993–1998.

==Research contributions==

He has made substantial contributions to the field of behavioral economics as well as innovative additions to the literature on development topics, such as discrimination, corruption, and corporate governance. According to IDEAS/RePEc, he ranked 185th in September 2018 in terms of research among 54 233 registered economists (i.e, among the top 0.4%).

His 2013 &quot;Poverty Impedes Cognitive Function&quot; published in &quot;Science&quot;, compared farmers&#x27; performance on intelligence tests in the bleak and stressful days before harvest, to the period of abundance following the sale of produce. Remarkably, the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, compared with after harvest, when rich. The controlled study found that the stress associated with poverty impeded other behaviors.

As a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research, he produced numerous papers that link behavioral science and economics. The 2002 paper &quot;Do Cigarette Taxes Make Smokers Happier&quot;, written together with Jonathan Gruber, found an improvement in smokers&#x27; psychological state when cigarette taxes were hiked to provide disincentive to buy cigarettes.

A December 2007 paper studies corruption in obtaining driving licenses in Delhi. On the average, individuals pay about twice the official amount to obtain a license and very few take the legally required driving test, resulting in many unqualified but licensed drivers. The magnitude of distortions in the allocation of licenses increases with citizens&#x27; willing to pay for licenses. The results support the view that corruption does not only transfer from citizens to bureaucrats but also distorts allocation. The paper also shows that partial anti-corruption measures have only a limited impact because players in this system adapt to the new environment. Specifically, a ban on agents at one regional transport office is associated with a high percentage of unqualified drivers overcoming the residency requirement and obtaining licenses at other license offices.

His influential 2004 paper &quot;Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination&quot; used a simple technique to measure labor market discrimination by switching the names at the top of resumes. Controlling for other factors, Mullainathan and his co-authors found that applications with white sounding names attained 50% more callbacks. The experiment provides convincing evidence of implicit discrimination in hiring practices.

In collaboration with Marianne Bertrand, Mullainathan published a series of papers scrutinizing executive compensation. The studies explain that increasing financial reward for CEO performance is a more complicated matter than incentive. Factors may enable CEOs to gain from luck, manipulating committees (the Skimming Model) and decreased sector competition.

His most-cited paper is a statistical methodology article, coauthored with Marianne Bertrand and Esther Duflo, which shows that a statistical procedure that is commonly used in the empirical economics literature frequently drastically overstates the stastical significance of the results. The article, &quot;How Much Should We Trust Differences-In-Differences Estimates?&quot; shows that when a trend is occurring, a statistical test of whether there has been a &quot;before and after&quot; change regarding some event, such as the passage of a law, is likely to find that there has been a significant change due to the passage of the law even when the law had no effect on the trend.

<text>Dandi is a village in the Jalalpore taluka, Navsari District, Gujarat, India. It is located on the coast of the Arabian Sea near the city of Navsari.

The village got into worldwide prominence in 1930, when Mahatma Gandhi selected it to be the destination for the Salt March. He marched from Sabarmati (Ahmedabad) to Dandi (Navsari) with some of his followers to protest against the imposition of a tax on salt by the British Raj. Thousands of people participated, travelling on foot for 24 days from Ahmedabad to Dandi.

The Government of India initiated plans to develop the Sabarmati-Dandi stretch as a tourist hub. In 2019 the National Salt Satyagraha Memorial to commemorate the Salt March of the Indian Independence Movement was opened in the village.

<text>WinPlus, originally Plus, was a cross-platform clone of the HyperCard application that enabled users to run HyperCard stacks on Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager. 

Originally the application was developed by Format Software GmbH (Cologne, Germany) to overcome deficits of Hypercard. It was released for the Mac in 1989, distributed by Olduvai, aimed at HyperCard power-users. Plus could run HyperCard stacks directly, and did so slightly faster than HyperCard itself. However, it also added many new features. Among the many &quot;wish list&quot; features were document-like resizable and scrollable windows, 8-bit color support, and the ability to display and work with graphics files stored externally. Plus did not, however, provide for pull-down menu support or allow stacks to be compiled into stand-alone applications, features of the competing Supercard.

Plus was purchased by Spinnaker Software and began the process of porting the system to Presentation Manager (OS/2) and Microsoft Windows. These versions used the same file format as the original, meaning it was the only HyperCard clone of the era that allowed a single stack to be used on all supported platforms. The system was later purchased by the newly formed ObjectPlus in early 1994, dropping the Mac and OS/2 versions and releasing the greatly updated WinPlus 3.0 in 1994, and 3.1 in 1995. By this time, the product was being referred to as a multimedia system, a niche market that most of the HyperCard-like systems had targeted.

WinPlus was also licensed by Oracle as the basis for Oracle Card, later known as Oracle Media Objects when the &quot;card&quot; terminology came to be frowned upon. It was first introduced in 1991 as part of &quot;Oracle for Windows&quot;, which included a full suite of client/server software and a variety of their existing database client-side interface programs (text based). Version 1.1 followed at the Oracle Developers and Integrators conference in 1992, followed shortly thereafter by the Mac version. The system was later re-purposed as the front-end for a database-hosted media system for interactive TV, changing the name to Oracle Media Objects. This project went nowhere, and Media Objects disappeared in the late 1990s.

<text>Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy are two Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters who debuted on &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot; and appeared in their own segment. The segments centered on the misadventures of a dachshund father-and-son team. Doggie Daddy (voiced by Doug Young with a Brooklyn accent, based on a Jimmy Durante impersonation) tried to do the best he could at raising his rambunctious son Augie (voiced by Daws Butler). The characters have made appearances outside of their series, including in their own video game and in &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Ark Lark&quot; and its spin-off series.

==Summary==
The segments centered around the misadventures of a dachshund father-and-son team. Doggie Daddy (voiced by Doug Young) tried to do the best he could at raising his rambunctious son Augie (voiced by Daws Butler). Augie, who loved his father, would often refer to him as &quot;dear old Dad&quot;. Their mutual admiration included Daddy gently chiding, &quot;Augie, my son, my son&quot;, when he would disappoint his father; and when his son would say or do something that inspired pride, Daddy would turn to the audience and say with a grin, &quot;Dat&#x27;s my boy who said dat!&quot;

The segments and characters were similar to the &quot;Spike and Tyke&quot; cartoons that William Hanna and Joseph Barbera produced during their theatrical animation careers at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Theme song==
A 45 rpm record released at the height of the show&#x27;s popularity featured the show&#x27;s theme song. The lyrics included this chorus:

An instrumental version of the song was used as the introductory theme to each cartoon.

==Character information==
===Augie Doggie===
Augie is a highly spirited male pup who is motivated by ambition and the desire to make his father proud. He is typically seen wearing only a green shirt. Possessing some knowledge in science and the ability to converse with animals, Augie would often capitalize upon his father&#x27;s foibles. In the remake series &quot;Jellystone!&quot;, Augie is depicted as female.

===Doggie Daddy===
The smooth-talking Doggie Daddy attempts to provide strict parental guidance to Augie, often to Augie&#x27;s displeasure. Doggie Daddy is usually depicted wearing only a purple collar. Despite his strictness, Doggie Daddy has a warm personality and typically acquiesces to his son&#x27;s wishes. Doug Young voiced Doggie Daddy as a Jimmy Durante impersonation.
