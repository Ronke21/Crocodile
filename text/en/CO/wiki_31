<text>Chely Wright (born Richell Rene Wright; October 25, 1970) is an American activist, author, and country music artist. She initially rose to fame as a commercial country recording artist with several charting singles, including the number one hit, &quot;Single White Female.&quot; She later became known for her role in LGBT activism after publicly coming out as a gay woman in 2010. She has sold over 1,500,000 copies and 10,000,000 digital impressions to date in the United States.

Raised in Kansas, Wright developed aspirations to become a country singer and songwriter. Yet, as a young child, she discovered her homosexuality and realized it conflicted with her Christian faith and her hopes of becoming a performer. Determined to become successful, she vowed to hide her sexuality and continued performing. Wright moved to Nashville, Tennessee, following high school graduation and was cast in stage productions at the now-defunct Opryland USA amusement park. She eventually signed her first recording contract in 1993 with PolyGram/Mercury Records and released two albums. With limited success, Wright switched record labels and had her first hit with 1997&#x27;s &quot;Shut Up and Drive&quot;. It was followed in 1999 with &quot;Single White Female,&quot; and a gold-certified album of the same name.

At her commercial zenith, Wright continued living a closeted life and became increasingly unhappy. She engaged in a long-term relationship with a woman but ultimately separated at the risk of being outed by members of the Nashville community. In 2006, Wright began suffering an emotional collapse and nearly took her own life. She then realized she needed to come out publicly and started working on projects that would help her come to terms with her homosexuality. In 2010, Wright released the memoir, &quot;Like Me: Confessions of a Heartland Country Singer,&quot; and the album, &quot;Lifted Off the Ground.&quot; Both projects centered around her coming out process and the acceptance of herself.

Wright became involved in LGBT activism following her 2010 decision. During that time she moved to New York City and released a documentary which chronicled her coming out titled, &quot;Wish Me Away.&quot; She would later establish a charity &quot;Like Me&quot;, which helped provide assistance to LGBT youth. She has since been a spokesperson for programs such as GLSEN. In recent years, she has held the role of Unispace&#x27;s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion officer. Wright would also marry and have two children. Wright also continued her music career, but transitioned more towards Americana and folk. She has since released 2016&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Rain&quot; and 2019&#x27;s &quot;Revival&quot;.

==Early life==
Wright was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1970, and was raised in the nearby community of Wellsville, Kansas. Wright was the youngest of three children born to Cheri and Stan Wright. Her parents&#x27; marriage was unhappy, partly due to her father&#x27;s drinking. This caused the family to temporarily separate while Wright was a small child. She lived with her mother and two siblings in Ottawa, Kansas, before her mother and father reunited. Wright had a strained relationship with her mother throughout her life. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say we were friends or buddies, but I liked my Mom,&quot; she wrote in her 2010 memoir.

Wright became interested in her Christian faith and convinced her mother to become baptized when she was six years old. She also discovered her homosexuality after noticing she had a crush on her third grade teacher. However, church teachings taught her that homosexuality was considered sinful behavior. &quot;I heard the words &#x27;whore,&#x27; &#x27;criminal,&#x27; &#x27;drunk,&#x27; &#x27;homosexual,&#x27; &#x27;pervert,&#x27; &#x27;liar&#x27; and &#x27;non-believer&#x27; all strung together so many times that I understood that those were the building blocks of sin and evildoing,&quot; she wrote in 2010. Every day as a child she prayed for her homosexual thoughts to be taken away. She attempted to find other examples of people in her hometown who were also homosexual, but had no luck. In her childhood, Wright often blamed negative events on her homosexual thoughts. This included when her brother broke a bone and the death of her cousin, David. &quot;It was God&#x27;s punishment for my being gay,&quot; she recalled.
Wright developed a passion for music at a young age. Both her parents enjoyed country music and encouraged her to also appreciate it. Her father played acoustic guitar, while she often sang along. Her mother kept handwritten lyrics to her favorite songs in a binder. The family often entertained guests on Saturday evenings and would throw &quot;pickin&#x27; parties.&quot; Wright often sang along with guests as they listened and played along to music. At age four, she began taking piano lessons. In her elementary years, she played trumpet in her school band. As a preteen, she started performing in singing groups. Wright also began performing in a local venues during this period, such as VFW halls, picnics, bars and churches.

At age 14, she started her own country music band called County Line, which included her father as their bass player. The summer of her final year in high school, she worked as a performing musician at the &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;, a long-running country music show in Branson, Missouri. In Branson, she rented a small trailer and bought her first car for $600. She also began dating a college-aged man whom she met sitting in the audience of her shows. Yet, Wright also realized she could not form the ideal romantic relationship with him: &quot;But soon I was wresting with my old fears again. Nothing could save me from being gay.&quot;

In 1989, she landed a position in a musical production at Opryland USA, a now-defunct theme park in Nashville, Tennessee. Making numerous costume changes in tight quarters led Wright to become good friends with several cast members. She also learned to sing as part of a vocal chorus and learned dance routines. Her contract only lasted one season and she later moved into the basement of a friend&#x27;s home closer to Nashville. She found employment at a local sporting goods store. It was at the store that she met a woman whom she would have her first brief intimate relationship with. During the summer of 1990, she was re-hired as part of the Opryland cast for a second season and started taking classes at Middle Tennessee State University.

==Music career==
===1993–1996: Beginnings at PolyGram and the rise to success===
Wright was signed to a publishing deal as a songwriter, which helped secure a recording contract as a recording artist with PolyGram/Mercury Records in 1993. Wright chose to keep her sexuality hidden from her record label and buying public, a theme which continued throughout her commercial career. She collaborated on her first album with Nashville producer, Harold Shedd. In a mutual agreement, Shedd agreed that Wright&#x27;s persona would not be centered around being &quot;a [music] video babe,&quot; but instead regarded for her artistic work as a country music artist. In 1994, Wright&#x27;s debut studio album was released through the label titled &quot;Woman in the Moon.&quot; The album would receive critical acclaim, despite limited success. The project spawned three singles (&quot;He&#x27;s a Good Ole Boy,&quot; &quot;Till I Was Loved by You&quot; and &quot;Sea of Cowboy Hats&quot;) that all peaked outside the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. The album helped Wright win Top New Female Vocalist at the 1995 Academy of Country Music Awards. Wright recalled in her memoir that she had low expectations of winning and was shocked to receive the accolade. &quot;I had not prepared a speech for that night, but I&#x27;d been rehearsing one since I was a little girl,&quot; she commented.

In 1996, Wright released her second album titled &quot;Right in the Middle of It.&quot; According to Wright, songs for the project were chosen carefully, even if they strayed from a traditional country sound. The album was produced by Ed Seay, along with Harold Shedd. At the time of its release, PolyGram/Mercury was hopeful of its success. The album had sold 42,000 copies in its initial release and its first music video had regular airtime on Country Music Television. Yet, the album was unsuccessful. Only two of its three singles charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Its highest-peaking single was 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Love That We Lost,&quot; which reached the top 50. &quot;Right in the Middle of It&quot; received acclaim from critics. Allmusic&#x27;s Charlotte Dillon rated the project at four and a half stars, praising Wright&#x27;s vocals and the album&#x27;s mix of material. With her lack of success, Wright was given permission to leave her contract with PolyGram/Mercury and she began exploring new options for commercial stardom.

===1997–2003: Breakout into the mainstream===
Free from her previous record label, Wright made several changes to her career. She began working with a new manager (Clarence Spalding) and a publicist (Wes Vause), who helped secure her a contract with MCA Records Nashville. Wright then contacted producer Tony Brown, who had previously made hit albums with Reba McEntire and Wynonna. Brown agreed to work with her and together they recorded her third album. In 1997, &quot;Let Me In,&quot; was released on MCA. According to Brown, the album&#x27;s material was backed by a simplified arrangement to help amplify Wright&#x27;s vocal performance. It received a four star rating from Thom Owens at Allmusic who highlighted its &quot;clean acoustic arrangements.&quot; Owens also called it her &quot;most accomplished and arguably best album to date.&quot; Meanwhile, Brian Wahlert of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; gave it a less favorable response, finding some of the material to be fillers rather than quality music. &quot;Let Me In&quot; was her first to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart, peaking at number 25 and spent 44 weeks there. It was also her first to enter the Billboard 200 where it charted for seven weeks. The album spawned Wright&#x27;s first major hit, &quot;Shut Up and Drive.&quot; The single peaked at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart and number 21 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Country chart in Canada. The album&#x27;s next two singles would reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; country top 40.
In 1999, Wright recorded her next song release, titled &quot;Single White Female.&quot; Once the recording was completed, producers Tony Brown, Buddy Cannon and Norro Wilson, believed the song could be a hit. The song would eventually reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and the &quot;RPM&quot; country chart. Wright celebrated the number one on the road with fellow band members, Jay DeMarcus and Joe Don Rooney (both of whom would later form Rascal Flatts). One month later, MCA celebrated by throwing Wright a &quot;Number One Party&quot; where she invited numerous guests inside and outside the music industry. The song was followed-up by another major hit, &quot;It Was,&quot; which reached number 11 on the American country chart. The same year, Wright&#x27;s fourth studio album of the same name was released. It peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and number 16 on Canada&#x27;s country albums chart. The album would eventually sell 500,000 copies and certify gold in sales from the Recording Industry Association of America. Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the studio effort, calling it &quot;a welcome addition to an already impressive catalog.&quot; Bill Friskics-Warren of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that despite its country pop production, the record &quot;hangs together as a sustained--and fairly compelling--song cycle about one woman&#x27;s search for intimacy.&quot;

In the fall of 2000, Wright began choosing songs for her upcoming fifth studio album. She composed the songs by herself, with help from Tim Nichols and Brad Paisley. Wright also served as the opening act on Paisley&#x27;s 2000 tour. The pair would also record a duet that would later be nominated for an accolade by the Country Music Association. The two would also become romantically involved during this time, all while Wright remained in a closeted relationship with a woman. In 2001, &quot;Never Love You Enough&quot; was released on MCA. Following on the heels of her previous release, the album was a chart success, climbing to number four on the Top Country Albums chart and number 62 on the Billboard 200. Yet its two singles only reached the top 30 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Its highest-charting hit was &quot;Jezebel,&quot; which reached number 23. The album received mixed reception from critics. Michael Gallucci called it a &quot;conservative follow-up,&quot; while &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; called it, &quot;a pleasant pop album, but hardly the sort of truly memorable work that Wright is so obviously capable of.&quot;

In 2001, Wright embarked on &quot;The Coca-Cola Hometown Hero Tour,&quot; a 30-date set of concerts and presented at the CMT Music Awards. She also made her acting debut the same year in the Disney film, &quot;Max Keeble&#x27;s Big Move.&quot; Wright was cast as the main character&#x27;s homeroom teacher. In 2002, Wright won the &quot;Fashion Plate Award&quot; from the CMT Flameworthy Awards. She would also be rated among &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; during this time as well. In 2002, she recorded a song for the soundtrack of &quot;The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea&quot; and was asked to be the &quot;guest of honor&quot; at Disney World. In 2003, Wright left MCA Records.

===2004–present: Musical transitions and coming out===
After leaving MCA, Wright co-wrote Clay Walker&#x27;s top ten hit, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Sleep&quot;. She also moved her recording career towards an independent direction. In 2004, she signed with the independent label, Vivaton, and also changed management. Her first Vivaton release was the 2004 single, &quot;Back of the Bottom Drawer.&quot; The song peaked at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Despite an intended album release, Wright exited Vivaton one month later, citing creative differences with label CEO, Jeff Huskins. Instead, she independently released an extended play titled &quot;Everything&quot;. In late 2004, Wright released the self-penned single, &quot;The Bumper of My SUV&quot;. She was inspired to write the song following a road-rage incident in which another driver was angry that Wright had a Marine Corps bumper sticker on her car. Following its release to radio, members of Wright&#x27;s fan club were accused of calling radio stations, falsely portraying military people to help it gain airplay. The conflict caused the single to be re-released in 2005 and it eventually peaked at number 35 on the Hot Country Songs chart. In 2005, she released her sixth album, &quot;The Metropolitan Hotel&quot;. Released on the independent Dualtone label, the project incorporated acoustic material with contemporary country. It reached number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and number 96 on the Billboard 200. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine concluded that it was &quot;her best and most complete album to date&quot;. &quot;No Depression&quot; found the album to have a &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;assertive edge&quot;.

Wright then went into a career hiatus after deciding to publicly come out to her record-buying public. She started writing material which would later make up her next studio release titled &quot;Lifted Off the Ground&quot;. She brought the album&#x27;s material to artist and producer, Rodney Crowell, who encouraged Wright to record it. The album&#x27;s sound contained a simpler arrangement that was comparable to folk music. It also contained material that alluded to her lesbian identity, particularly the track, &quot;Like Me&quot;. The album reached number 32 on the Top Country Albums chart and 200th position on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. The record and her corresponding memoir were released both on May 4, 2010. Reflecting on the experience, Wright told &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;I really do feel lifted off the ground. I have no secret now. I feel like I&#x27;m floating. I&#x27;m so proud to be standing where I am today&quot;. &quot;Lifted Off the Ground&quot; received four stars from Thom Jurek of Allmusic who cited Crowell&#x27;s production and Wright&#x27;s songwriting as the reasons for its success. Meanwhile, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; believed Wright could have challenged the country music establishment more rather than &quot;tread lighty&quot; in her songwriting material.

With the exception of a guest appearance on a Rodney Crowell album, Wright took a five-year break from music. During her hiatus, she got married, started a family and dedicated additional time to LGBT activism. &quot;I realize the power I had that I didn’t know I had&quot;, Wright said in response to her hiatus. Yet, she continued songwriting and brought new material to Crowell, who got her in contact with producer Joe Henry. Henry agreed to produce her and Wright formed a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the record. In 2016, she released &quot;I Am the Rain.&quot; The album featured collaborations with Crowell, Emmylou Harris and The Milk Carton Kids. It was considered a departure from her previous records, with roots centered in the Americana genre. &quot;I Am the Rain&quot; was her highest-charting album in ten years, reaching number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums list. It also reached number 181 on the &quot;Billboard 200.&quot; &quot;I Am the Rain&quot; received a positive response from &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, who compared the project to that of Carole King&#x27;s &quot;Tapestry&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s Marcey Donelson positively commented that the album had an &quot;intimate tone&quot;.

In 2018, Wright released the extended play titled &quot;Santa Will Find You!&quot;. The album was a collection of Christmas songs, two of which had previously appeared on Mindy Smith&#x27;s project, &quot;My Holiday&quot;. The album&#x27;s release was followed by a ten-day holiday concert tour that began in Decatur, Georgia. In March 2019, she released her third extended play, &quot;Revival.&quot; The five-song EP was produced by Jeremy Lister, who also performed on the record&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Say the Word&quot;. In August 2019, Wright returned to the stage of The Grand Ole Opry after a decade-long absence. Her last invitation to play the venue had been before publicly coming out in 2010.

===Musical styles===
Wright&#x27;s musical style is rooted in country, but also in the genres of Americana and country-folk. Wright&#x27;s early musical style was built on a traditional country platform. &quot;Roughstock&quot; called her first two albums with PolyGram/Mercury to be &quot;traditional,&quot; while also incorporating quality songwriting material. Critics have noted that Wright&#x27;s MCA albums incorporated more contemporary styles, while also including the traditional country from her PolyGram days. Thom Owens of Allmusic found that 1997&#x27;s &quot;Let Me In&quot; had &quot;clean acoustic arrangements&quot; and &quot;only a few cuts [were] adorned with pop/rock instrumentation.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine observed a similar trend with 1999&#x27;s &quot;Single White Female&quot;: &quot;The record picks up where its predecessor left off, offering a selection of ten songs with clean, tasteful arrangements that place Wright in the forefront...Even when Wright and Brown shoot for the charts, they pull it off, since Chely never oversings and the instrumentation is never bombastic.&quot;

With 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Metropolitan Hotel,&quot; Wright stated that she made more of an effort to shift towards Americana. However, she also felt the need to mix in radio-friendly styles, according to a 2019 interview. In a similar vein, Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that she had not &quot;completely abandoned the sound of contemporary country-pop&quot;, but also had &quot;stripped-back and direct&quot; songs. Wright&#x27;s musical sound moved further away from contemporary country sounds into the Americana format. Music journalists, such as Stephen L. Betts, observed her Americana transition in 2016&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Rain.&quot; In the same 2019 article, Wright explained that her style remains anchored to country roots despite an Americana feel: &quot;I want to be an artist that can be 60 years old sitting on stage at the Ford Theater at the Country Music Hall of Fame telling stories and singing songs that would be appropriate for a 60-year-old woman&quot;.

==Activist career==
===2000–2010: Early activism===
Wright first began her work with activism through music education. She was inspired to help public schools following the Columbine High School massacre. In 2000, she established the Reading, Writing and Rhythm non-profit organization. The program helps provide public schools with musical instruments and brings attention to the significance of music education. Wright holds a yearly concert for the organization in Nashville that has included numerous performers in its lineup. Musicians at previous events have included Jann Arden, Rodney Crowell, Taylor Swift and Tanya Tucker The concert has also helped raise significant amounts of money for the organization — in 2007 it raised $185,000. Since its inception, Reading, Writing and Rhythm has raised nearly one million dollars. &quot;I&#x27;m so proud of this charity and the difference we&#x27;ve been able to make in so many young people&#x27;s lives,&quot; she said in 2010. In 2002, Wright received the National Association for Music Education&#x27;s &quot;FAME Award&quot; in recognition of her accomplishments.
Wright has also been involved in working with military members and veterans. Following the September 11 attacks, she embarked on a USO tour performing for American troops in Iraq. She also met with servicemen in Germany and Kuwait. During the same period, she visited veterans and military servicemen recovering at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. In the early 2000s, also joined wounded and recovering troops at a private military service event hosted by former vice president, Dick Cheney. In 2003, she was named &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; by the American Legion Auxiliary

She has also spoken out against the former American military policy, Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell. In her 2010 memoir, Wright wrote that the law &quot;made no sense&quot; to her and that she believed policymakers at the time were wrong for accepting it. In addition, she stated she believes it was put into practice due to a misconception that LGBT people are more likely to be sexually promiscuous. In her book, Wright further explained her reasoning: &quot;Homosexuality does not make a person promiscuous, perverted, unprofessional, or without judgment.&quot; She later spoke out about it again in 2010 with &quot;Entertainment Weekly.&quot; Wright commented that she was &quot;angry&quot; that former president George W. Bush and former vice president Cheney had not spoken out on the law.

===2010–present: LGBT activism===
Wright became involved in LGBT activism following her decision to publicly come out in 2010. She received notable attention in the LGBT community with the release of her 2010 memoir, &quot;Like Me: Confessions of a Heartland Country Singer.&quot; The book was published by Random House, Inc. The book described Wright&#x27;s rise to fame and struggle with being a closeted person in the country music industry. It also chronicles Wright&#x27;s realization of her identity as a lesbian. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly,&quot; Wright explained that she chose to write the book for herself but also to encourage other LGBT individuals to accept themselves as they are: &quot;...if I aid someone or comfort someone or help facilitate understanding for someone in the process, that’s a great byproduct of what I’m doing,&quot; she explained. The book received positive reviews from critics following its release. Jack Feerick of &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; praised Wright for being &quot;unpolished and raw.&quot; The &quot;New York Journal of Books&quot; called the memoir &quot;gut-wrenching&quot; in their review of the book. &quot;Like Me&quot; later received recognition from the LGBT literature association, the Lambda Awards, in 2011.
Shortly after coming out, Wright performed at the 2010 Capitol Pride parade in Washington D.C. She also made several national public television appearances to discuss her coming out story and LGBT rights on shows, including &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot; Wright also spoke out on CNN in 2010 to discuss the increased suicide rate by LGBT youth in the United States. Also included on program were Nate Berkus, Kathy Griffin and Wanda Sykes. In 2010, Wright was named the National Spokesperson for the organization GLSEN. Wright was named one of &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual 100 People of the Year. &quot;Metro Source New York&quot; magazine named her as one of the 20 people We Love in 2010. In 2011, she appeared in the PBS documentary, &quot;Out in America,&quot; that discussed the LGBT experience in the United States. After U.S. President Barack Obama announced his support for LGBT rights, Wright endorsed his re-election campaign in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=11984&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Wright released a documentary chronicling her coming-out story titled &quot;Wish Me Away.&quot; The film was officially released to American markets in spring 2012. The film was directed by Bobbie Birleffi and Beverly Kopf. Both directors filmed &quot;Wish Me Away&quot; over a three-year span. The documentary was reviewed positively following its release. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a sympathetic, emotional portrait of a life at a pivotal transition.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded, &quot;By the end you may not be a fan of her music, but it’s hard not to root for her rebirth.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented that &quot;Wish Me Away&quot; was released at &quot;the right moment&quot; because marriage equality was a hot-button topic at the time. &quot;Wish Me Away&quot; was later nominated by the GLAAD Media Awards in the category of &quot;Outstanding Documentary.&quot; It also won an accolade from the Los Angeles Film Festival and received a nomination from the Emmy Awards. Since its release, Wright stated that she still receives letters from LGBT individuals who said it has helped them acknowledge their own sexuality.

In 2012, Wright established an LGBT organization titled, &quot;LIKEME.&quot; The nonprofit organization is designed to help educate and provide assistance to individuals in the LGBT community. This includes youth, adults and family members of those struggling with their sexual identity. In May 2012, Wright and the organization founded a &quot;Lighthouse&quot; center in Kansas City, Missouri. The community center includes resources, staff and counselors to help those in the LGBT community find support. Since its launch, the center has received funds from various events, including a 2016 live performance fundraiser.

In 2014, Wright spoke on the stage of the GLAAD Media Awards to discuss anti-bullying legislation with fellow activist Marcel Neergaard. She also introduced country artist Kacey Musgraves, who performed her song, &quot;Follow Your Arrow.&quot; In recent years, Wright has been outspoken on transgender bathroom laws. She discussed her views against the laws on Twitter and on other social media platforms. In 2016, Wright appeared on CNN encouraging the country music industry to be supportive of laws that protect transgender Americans in the state of Tennessee.

In 2021, Wright was announced as the Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer for the interior space company Unispace. She has since formed collaborations with the Women&#x27;s Business Enterprise National Council and the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council. In describing her transition into the role, Wright commented, &quot;I wanted to leverage my public capital in that way. That&#x27;s when I began working in corporate spaces, higher education, faith communities, and, combining all of those strategies.&quot;

Wright helped inspire the creation of the 2022 book &quot;My Moment&quot;, which included stories from various female entertainers and their experiences with the MeToo movement.

==Personal life==
===Early relationships, closeted identity and breaking point===
Wright harbored the belief her sexual orientation was immoral and that her secret would kill her career hopes, as a result of her Christian upbringing. From early childhood, she resolved to never confide her orientation to anyone or to pursue romantic relationships with women. Despite her resolution against having sex with women, Wright disclosed in her memoir that, by her early thirties, she had had sexual relationships with two women. She had her first same-sex experience at age 19 — &quot;it was the first time I&#x27;d ever had a girl&#x27;s body pressed against mine&quot;—and the affair lasted the better part of a year. From 1993 to about 2004, Wright maintained a committed relationship with a woman she described as &quot;the love of my life.&quot; In her memoir, Wright uses the pseudonym Julia to keep her identity hidden. She met Julia shortly after winning her first recording contract. The era of their relationship overlaps Wright&#x27;s rise to chart-topping stardom. They maintained their relationship even though her partner subsequently married a man, and even while both women briefly had relationships with men.
In 1998, Wright had a brief relationship with country artist Vince Gill. The pair had originally met as artists both signed to MCA Records. Although the pair had developed a friendship, Gill was also developing an affection for Christian singer-songwriter, Amy Grant. At the same time, Wright still had feelings for her long-term female partner. Gill and Wright eventually split, but remained on friendly terms. In the last months of 2000, Wright began a relationship with country singer Brad Paisley. Even though Wright and Julia had moved in together earlier that year, and Wright admitted she felt no sexual attraction to Paisley, she recounted that &quot;he&#x27;s wickedly smart, which is one of the reasons why I made the decision to spend time with him. I loved Brad. I never had the capacity to fall in love with him, but I figured if I’m gonna live a less than satisfied life, this is the guy I could live my life with. If I’m gonna be with a boy, this is the boy.&quot; She held him in high esteem and great affection in every way other than sexual attraction. In her autobiography she expressed remorse for how she treated Paisley.

In her memoir, Wright described being confronted about her sexuality for the first time. In March 2005, she met up with long-time friend, John Rich. After enjoying a night out, Rich drove her back. In the car ride, Rich confronted Wright about her sexuality: &quot;You know people talk about you...they wonder if you&#x27;re, you know, gay...You know, that&#x27;s not cool. People don&#x27;t approve of that deviant behavior. It&#x27;s a sin.&quot; The confrontation caused Wright to become fearful of being outed and ultimately led her to end her 12-year relationship with Julia. The pair would soon split and Wright moved out of their home. After Wright&#x27;s coming out in 2010, Rich issued a statement that stated his confrontation was &quot;taken the wrong way.&quot; He also commented that he wished Wright &quot;the best in her personal and professional life.&quot;

After moving out, Wright began to reach a personal breaking point in 2006. That year, she nearly took her own life while alone at her home in Nashville. She pointed a gun into her mouth, but changed her mind before pulling the trigger. In her memoir, Wright realized she had an &quot;urge to fight&quot; and had a determination to become stronger. After staying in bed for several days, she rode her bike 13 miles around the Nashville area. &quot;Keep pedaling, keep pushing, keep fighting for a breath,&quot; she recalled.

===Coming out and current life===
Wright eventually abandoned the belief of hiding her sexual identity. She soon took steps towards coming out. In 2008, Wright made the move from Nashville to New York City where she became more involved with the LGBT community. During this period, she came out to members of her immediate family and to a few of her close friends. It was not until 2007 that she decided to come out publicly, but spent the next three years writing her autobiography. She stated that she wanted to come out to free herself from the burdens of living a lie, to lend support to LGBT youth, and to dismantle the notion that being gay is immoral. On May 3, 2010, &quot;People&quot; magazine reported her coming out. Wright became one of the first members of the country music community to come out as gay; country artist k.d. lang came out in 1992 (though she later abandoned the country music genre), and Kristen Hall, formerly of Sugarland, was openly gay while working with that band.

Following her announcement, Wright received support from fellow country artists LeAnn Rimes, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Faith Hill, Naomi Judd, SHeDAISY and Trisha Yearwood. She also found new fans that discovered her through the LGBT community and through social media platforms. Wright also lost a significant chunk of her fan base and her record sales dropped in half.

Two weeks after publicly coming out, Wright met fellow LGBT activist and Sony Music marketing director Lauren Blitzer. On April 6, 2011, Wright announced her engagement to Blitzer. The couple married on August 20, 2011, in a private ceremony on a country estate in Connecticut officiated by both a rabbi and a reverend. On January 23, 2013, the couple announced that Chely was expecting identical twins. In May 2013, Wright gave birth to two twin boys named George and Everett. Both children were named after their great-grandfathers, according to Wright.

In 2018, Wright suffered a stroke. After having a series of migraine headaches that felt unusual, Wright went to the emergency room at New York&#x27;s Lenox Hill Hospital. Her doctor there confirmed that she had suffered a stroke. Wright made the news public a year later to help encourage other people to seek medical attention if they notice similar symptoms.

<doc id="1277647" wikidata="Q1140288" url="?curid=1277647" title="Statues (game)">
<text>Statues, also known as Red Light, Green Light in North America, and Grandma&#x27;s/Grandmother&#x27;s Footsteps or Fairy Footsteps in the United Kingdom is a popular children&#x27;s game, often played in different countries. There are variations of play throughout different regions of the world.

== General rules ==

# A person starts out as the &quot;curator&quot; (It, Granny, Pooh, etc.) and stands at the end of a field. Everyone else playing stands at the far end (distance depends upon playing area selected). The objective of the game is for a &quot;statue&quot; to tag the curator, thereby becoming the curator and resetting the game.
# The curator turns their back to the field, and the &quot;statues&quot; attempt to race across and tag the curator.
# Whenever the curator turns around, the statues must freeze in position and hold that for as long as the curator looks at them. The curator may even be allowed to walk around the statues, examining them. The curator needs to be careful – whenever the curator&#x27;s back is turned, statues are allowed to move.
# If a statue is caught moving they are sent back to the starting line to begin again, or eliminated.

== Variations ==

=== Red Light, Green Light ===
Red Light, Green Light is a variation of Statues played throughout North America. The title of the game refers to the colors of a traffic light. 
* Like Statues, Red Light, Green Light is played in a field or another long space.
* One player, the Caller, stands at one end of the field and calls out to the rest of the players who line up at the other end.
* The Caller turns around, looking away from the rest of the players and calls out &quot;green light!&quot;
* While the Caller is looking away, the other players are permitted to move, and they attempt to advance on the Caller. The objective is to get close enough to the Caller to tag them.
* At any point while the Caller is turned away, they can call &quot;red light!&quot; and turn back around to face the players. When this is called, the players must freeze in place. If the Caller observes any player moving, they send them back to the start.
* This repeats until another player tags the Caller.
* The caller may recite &quot;red light!&quot; and &quot;green light!&quot; as fast or slow as they would like in order to catch the other players while they are still moving.
* The first player to tag the Caller without being caught becomes the new Caller, and all other players return to the start to begin another round.

There are different levels of stringency in regard to how much movement the Caller may observe to send a player back to the start. Some allow general movement as long as the players are not moving their feet from the ground, while others restrict any large bodily movements, such as swaying of the arms or even smiling. Blinking and breathing are generally permitted.

In the Dutch version, instead of &quot;green light!&quot; the Caller sings in a slow voice &quot;Annemaria&quot;, followed by a quick and loud &quot;Koekoek!&quot; (&quot;Cuckoo!&quot;) when they turn around (like &quot;red light!&quot;). &quot;Koekoek!&quot; is also the Dutch equivalent of a Peekaboo game played with babies, where the parents hide their face with their hands, then reveal themselves whilst saying &quot;Peek-a-boo!&quot; (also known in Dutch as &quot;Kiekeboe!&quot;).

The Flemish version of the game is called &quot;1, 2, 3 Piano&quot;, in which the Caller shouts &quot;één, twee, drie, piano!&quot; (translating to one, two, three, piano in English) before turning around to the other players. Only during the time this sentence is being shouted, the participants are allowed to move.

=== Winnie the Pooh ===
Winnie the Pooh is a variation of Statues where the person playing &quot;Pooh&quot; (the Curator) usually leans against a wall and has to shout &quot;1, 2, 3, Winnie the Pooh, stop!&quot; (so it is long enough for the players to reach some distance and because of the rhyme it provides in Bulgarian, where this version comes from) before turning to face the players. Whenever a player tags Pooh they have to run so it doesn&#x27;t catch them. If they manage to go back to the wall where Pooh was leaning before it catches them, they become Pooh and the game starts over. In this variation the role of Pooh is more desirable.

=== Team building exercise ===
Another variation of the game was altered as a team building exercise. It follows the Red Light, Green Light rules with exception that if anybody moves after the red light the whole team must return to the starting line. Also, the object of the game is for the players to &quot;steal&quot; an &quot;object&quot; positioned near the &quot;it&quot; person and return with it to the other side of the field. Once the &quot;object&quot; is moved it has to stay hidden from &quot;it&quot;, who has several chances to guess who has it at the moment. If guessed successfully then the whole team must return to the starting line.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Doctor Who&quot; writer Russell T Davies said that the statue role in Grandmother&#x27;s Footsteps was a concept for the Weeping Angel, a recurring monster on the 2005–present show.
* In &quot;The Railway Series&quot; story &quot;Percy and the Trousers&quot;, Percy tries to play Grandmother&#x27;s Footsteps with the coaches, but instead hits a trolley of trousers.
* Folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary adapted this game into a song called &quot;Rocky Road&quot; on their 1963 album, &quot;In the Wind&quot;.
* Hajime Syacho, the most popular YouTuber in Japan and participants, 740 in all, played &quot;Daruma-san ga koronda&quot; at Industrial Development Center in Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture on 24 October 2015 which has been listed in the Guinness World Records.
* In the 1942 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;The Case of the Missing Hare&quot;, Bugs plays a statues game on the magician while Ala Bahma charges at Bugs to kill him.
* In the 1987 film &quot;RoboCop&quot;, the titular character is seen playing the game with elementary school children in footage shown during an in-film news report.
* In the Japanese manga &quot;As the Gods Will&quot; and its 2014 film adaptation, it is one of the games the students are forced to play with a Daruma doll.
* The third chapter of the 2017 game &quot;&quot; features this game as a method to obtain the key to progress. The player must collect the key and return without being caught by the cultist and the gray demon. Failing to comply will result in death.
* In the 2021 dystopian Netflix series &quot;Squid Game&quot;, it was the first game of the competition. Contestants played the game with a large doll resembling Young-hee, a young girl from a Korean book series. The game played was a deadlier iteration, where anyone caught moving would be shot dead.
* &quot;Crab Game&quot;, a 2021 game based on the Netflix series &quot;Squid Game&quot;, features the game as portrayed in the show—only in this version, players explode rather than being shot when they lose.
* In the 2022 game &quot;Poppy Playtime: Chapter 2 – Fly in a Web&quot;, there is a section somewhat similar to this game where the player must navigate through an obstacle course while being chased by a large caterpillar toy. When a light comes on, they must stand still and cannot move until it goes off again.

<text>George Robert Sims (2 September 1847 – 4 September 1922) was an English journalist, poet, dramatist, novelist and &quot;&quot;.

Sims began writing lively humour and satiric pieces for &quot;Fun&quot; magazine and &quot;The Referee&quot;, but he was soon concentrating on social reform, particularly the plight of the poor in London&#x27;s slums. A prolific journalist and writer he also produced a number of novels.

Sims was also a very successful dramatist, writing numerous plays, often in collaboration, several of which had long runs and international success. He also bred bulldogs, was an avid sportsman and lived richly among a large circle of literary and artistic friends. Sims earned a fortune from his productive endeavours but had gambled most of it away by the time of his death.

==Biography==
Sims was born in Kennington, London, England. His parents were George Sims, a prosperous merchant, and Louisa Amelia Ann Stevenson, president of the Women&#x27;s Provident League. Sims was the oldest of six children, who were exposed to their parents&#x27; cosmopolitan artistic and progressive friends, including suffragists. He grew up in Islington, London, and his mother often took him to the theatre. He was educated in Eastbourne and then Hanwell Military College and the University of Bonn. He had begun to write poetry at the age of ten, and at Bonn he wrote some plays, including an adaptation of &quot;Dr. Wespe&quot; by Roderich Benedix. He completed his studies in Germany and France, where he also became interested in gambling. In Europe, he translated Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Contes drôlatiques&quot;, which was published in 1874 by Chatto and Windus; but it was considered too racy and was withdrawn, only to be reissued in 1903.

Sims was married three times and was twice a widower. In 1876 he married Sarah Elizabeth Collis (b. 1850), in 1888 he married Annie Maria Harriss (b. 1859) and in 1901 he married Elizabeth Florence Wykes (b. 1873), who survived him. None of these marriages produced any children. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote in Sims&#x27;s obituary that 
:&quot;so attractive and original was the personality revealed in his abundant output—for he was a wonderfully hard worker—that no other journalist has ever occupied quite the same place in the affections not only of the great public but also of people of more discriminating taste... Sims was indeed a born journalist, with the essential &quot;flair&quot; added to shrewd common sense, imagination, wide sympathies, a vivid interest in every side of life, and the most ardent patriotism... He was [also] a highly successful playwright... a zealous social reformer, an expert criminologist, a connoisseur in good eating and drinking, in racing, in dogs, in boxing, and in all sorts of curious and out-of-the-way people and things.&quot;

===Journalism, satire and social writings===

He returned to England and briefly worked in his father&#x27;s business, but his interests lay in writing, and he began to write stories and poetry. He began to publish pieces in &quot;Fun&quot; in 1874, succeeding editor Tom Hood and making friendships with fellow contributors W. S. Gilbert and Ambrose Bierce. He also contributed early to the &quot;Weekly Dispatch&quot;. In 1876, Sims penned a satiric open letter &quot;To a Fashionable Tragedian&quot;, humorously accusing actor-producer Henry Irving of inciting mass murder by emphasising the gore in his Shakespeare plays and of paying bribes to critics. Irving sued Sims and his editor Harry Sampson for libel, but after an apology he withdrew the legal action.

In 1877, he began contributing to a new Sunday sports and entertainments paper, edited by Sampson, &quot;The Referee&quot;, writing a weekly column of miscellany, &quot;Mustard and Cress&quot;, under the pseudonym Dagonet, until his death. This was so successful that compilations of his verses from the paper, published as &quot;The Dagonet Ballads&quot; (1879) and &quot;Ballads of Babylon&quot; (1880), sold in hundreds of thousands of copies and were constantly in print during the next thirty years. He also wrote amusing and popular travelogues, also as Dagonet. He became editor of &quot;One and All&quot; in 1879 and for various papers wrote about horse racing, showing dogs, boxing, and leisure. Although Sims published his &quot;Mustard and Cress&quot; column every week for 45 years without fail, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, 
:&quot;week after week... the page read freshly and seemed always to have something new in it. It was sprinkled with neat little epigrams in verse, patriotic songs or parodies, with jokes, puns, conundrums, catch-words. He talked of politics... philanthropy, amusement, reminiscence, food and drink, and such travel as so confirmed a Cockney could enjoy. ...he would champion the cause of the unfortunate middle classes... He took his readers into his confidence, and told them all about... his friends... his pets... And he contrived to do this without ever becoming egotistical or a bore.&quot;

Sims is best remembered for his dramatic monologue from &quot;The Dagonet Ballads&quot; that opens &quot;It is Christmas Day in the workhouse&quot;. Its zealous social concern aroused public sentiment and made Sims a strong voice for reform, dramatising the plight of suffering Londoners. He also contributed numerous articles from 1879 to 1883 about the bad condition of the poor in London&#x27;s slums in the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot;, &quot;Daily News&quot; and other papers. Many of these were later published in book form, such as &quot;The Theatre of Life&quot; (1881, Fuller), &quot;Horrible London&quot; (1889, Billing and Sons), &quot;The Social Kaleidoscope&quot;, and &quot;The Three Brass Balls&quot;. In particular, in 1881, Sims and Frederick Barnard wrote a series of illustrated articles entitled &quot;How the Poor Live&quot; for a new journal, &quot;The Pictorial World&quot;. This was published in book form in 1883. He also wrote many popular ballads attempting to draw attention to the predicament of the poor. These efforts were important in raising public opinion on the subject and led to reform legislation in the Act of 1885.

Sims was appointed as part of an 1882 study of social conditions in Southwark in 1882 and as a witness before the 1884 royal commission on working-class housing. Sims also raised public awareness of other issues, including white slave traffic in a series articles published in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, later in book form as &quot;London by Night&quot; (1906) and &quot;Watches of the Night&quot; (1907); and the maltreatment of children, writing &quot;The Black Stain&quot; (1907). Together with Elizabeth Burgwin, he founded the &quot;Referee Children&#x27;s Free Breakfast and Dinner Fund&quot; (1880). Burgwin had already been supplying free breakfats and dinners at her school, but she persuaded him to write an annual appeal in &quot;The Referee&quot;. By 1900 it was the largest charity supplying free school meals in London. He also worked to promote the boys&#x27; clubs movement and campaigned to open museums and galleries and permit concerts on Sundays as part of the National Sunday League.

He also published a number of novels, including:
*&quot;Rogues and Vagabonds&quot;
*&quot;Memoirs of Mary Jane&quot;
*&quot;Mary Jane Married&quot;
*&quot;Memoirs of a Landlady&quot;
*&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;
*&quot;Li Ting of London&quot;

His autobiography, &quot;My Life: Sixty Years&#x27; Recollections of Bohemian London&quot; (1917) became very popular. It consisted of reminiscences originally contributed to &quot;The Evening News&quot;. Its profiles of Sims London contemporaries are written kindly but with zest. His other books include:

*&quot;The Coachman&#x27;s Club, Or, Tales Told Out of School&quot; (1897, F. V. White and Co.)
*&quot;Living London&quot; (3 vols. 1901–1903, Cassell, chronicling the variety in London life)
*&quot;Among My Autographs&quot; (1904, Chatto &amp; Windus)

Sims was intrigued by the psychology of crime, and he penned some ingenious detective stories. His story collection, &quot;Dorcas Dene, Detective&quot; (1897) featured an early example of a female detective in crime fiction. One of the Dorcas Dene stories, &#x27;The Haverstock Hill Murder&#x27;, was dramatised for BBC Radio in 2008. At Arthur Lambton&#x27;s Crimes Club, Sims took pleasure in discussing cases with Max Pemberton, Conan Doyle and Churton Collins. He was consumed with the murders of Jack the Ripper and even became a suspect. A modern edition of his poetry, &quot;Prepare to Shed Them Now: The Ballads of George R Sims&quot;, was published in 1968.

Sims&#x27;s sympathy and wit were not enough to spare him some criticism. To make fun of Sims the &quot;National Observer&quot;, in 1892, nominated him to succeed Tennyson as poet laureate. The members of the aesthetic movement were sometimes contemptuous of Sims, and in 1894 he was the butt of a spoof in &quot;The Green Carnation&quot; by Robert Hichens. In 1899, Charles Whibley wrote an acid profile of Sims. Sims later sacrificed some of his standing among progressives with his 1906 campaign in &quot;The Tribune&quot;, titled &quot;Bitter cry of the middle classes&quot;, in which he criticised organised labour and argued that lower middle-class tradesmen and workers were over-taxed in the name of statism.

===Plays===

Sims wrote over thirty plays, but most of them were adapted from European pieces. His first hit play, &quot;Crutch and Toothpick&quot;, based on a French farce by Labiche, was produced at the Royalty Theatre in 1879 and enjoyed a run for 240 nights. In 1881, he wrote the even more successful melodrama, &quot;The Lights o&#x27; London&quot;, produced by Wilson Barrett at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, London. This ran for 286 nights and toured in the British provinces, as well as earning record ticket sales in America. It went on to tour continuously in Europe and elsewhere through World War I. His next play, &quot;The Romany Rye&quot;, opened in 1882 at the Princess&#x27;s and was a hit. On opening night at the Theatre Royal, Exeter, during its regional tour, scenery caught fire during the performance, causing the Exeter Theatre Royal fire, which remains the UK&#x27;s deadliest building fire, and worst theatre disaster, killing 186 people. All of the cast and crew survived the fire, which mostly killed audience members in the pits and gallery, and the tour continued, although at the following performance, costumes and scenery had to improvised and borrowed as they had all been lost in the blaze.

In the early 1880s, Sims became the first playwright to have four plays running simultaneously in West End theatres. He also had a dozen touring companies playing his works by that time. He collaborated on many of his plays, and his co-authors included Barrett, Sydney Grundy and Clement Scott.

His most successful collaboration was with Henry Pettitt, with whom he created a substantial body of hits, including &quot;In the Ranks&quot; (1883, 457 performances at the Adelphi Theatre) and &quot;The Harbour Lights&quot; (1885, 513 performances at the Adelphi). Their Gaiety Theatre musical burlesques included &quot;Faust up to Date&quot; (1888), which remained a hit for several years and coined a new meaning for the phrase &quot;up-to-date&quot;, meaning &quot;abreast&quot; of the latest styles and facts. Their next hit was &quot;Carmen up to Data&quot; (1890). Both of these were composed by the Gaiety&#x27;s music director, Meyer Lutz. With Cecil Raleigh, he wrote the hit burlesque opera, &quot;Little Christopher Columbus&quot; (1893), and among his other musical plays were &quot;Blue-eyed Susan&quot; at the Prince of Wales Theatre (1892, starring Arthur Roberts) and &quot;The Dandy Fifth&quot; (Birmingham, 1898) and &quot;Dandy Dick Whittington&quot; (1895), at the Avenue Theatre, with a score by Ivan Caryll. Robert Buchanan and Sims co-authored five melodramas at the Adelphi between 1890 and 1893, including &quot;The Trumpet Call&quot; (1891), starring Mrs Patrick Campbell early in her career. On stage, one night, Mrs. Campbell&#x27;s costume collapsed which, her biographer suggests, extended the run of that play. Sims and Mrs Campbell had an affair, but she tired of it before he did. In 1896, Sims wrote the melodrama &quot;Two Little Vagabonds&quot; with Arthur Shirley (an adaptation of &quot;Les deux gosses&quot;) which was a hit at Princess&#x27;s Theatre and enjoyed many revivals. He also co-wrote some pantomimes, including &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; produced at the Drury Lane Theatre.

Sims&#x27;s other famous melodramas included:
* &quot;The Golden Ladder&quot;
* &quot;Master and the Man&quot;
* &quot;The Star of India&quot;
* &quot;The Gypsy Earl&quot;
* &quot;Scarlet Sin&quot;
* &quot;The Silver Falls&quot; (1888)
* &quot;The English Rose&quot; (1890)
* &quot;The Trumpet Call&quot; (1891)
* &quot;The White Rose&quot; (1892), starring Mrs. Patrick Campbell
* &quot;The Lights of Home&quot; (1892), starring Mrs. Patrick Campbell
* &quot;The Black Domino&quot; (1893)

His other notable comedies included:
* *&quot;Memoirs of a Mother-in-Law&quot; (1881)
* &quot;The Member for Slocum&quot; (1881)
* &quot;The Gay City&quot; (1881)

===Later years===

Sims enjoyed his position as a successful author and playwright and belonged to the Devonshire Club, the Eccentric Club and others. He reported earnings of nearly £150,000 in 1898, but he gambled most of his wealth away, or gave it to charities, by the time of his death. He was passionate about sports, especially horse racing and boxing, and he played badminton and bred bulldogs. Sims invented a tonic, Tatcho, that was marketed to cure baldness, but his friends found this a source of mirth when it did not stop his own hairline from receding.

Sims used the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to wage a campaign to secure the pardon and release of a Norwegian, Adolph Beck, who had twice been imprisoned because of mistaken identity. This effort led to the establishment, in 1907, of the court of criminal appeal. For his assistance, in 1905, the king of Sweden and Norway made him a knight of the Order of St Olav, first class, awarded by in 1905.

He died at his home in Regent&#x27;s Park, London, just after his 75th birthday in 1922, from liver cancer. After a funeral service at St Marylebone Parish Church, his body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, and his ashes were scattered in the crematorium&#x27;s grounds.

<text>The Newport Rising was the last large-scale armed rising in Wales, by Chartists whose demands included democracy and the right to vote with a secret ballot. 

On Monday 4 November 1839, approximately 4,000 Chartist sympathisers, under the leadership of John Frost, marched on the town of Newport, Monmouthshire. En route, some Newport chartists were arrested by police and held prisoner at the Westgate Hotel in central Newport. Chartists from industrial towns outside of Newport, including many coal-miners, some with home-made arms, were intent on liberating their fellow Chartists. Fighting began, and soldiers of the 45th Regiment of Foot, deployed in the protection of the police, were ordered to open fire. Between 10 and 24 Chartists were confirmed killed, whilst reports of perhaps a further 50 injured. Four soldiers were reported as injured, as well as the mayor of Newport who was within the hotel. Subsequently, the leaders of the rising were convicted of treason and were sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. The sentences were later commuted to transportation.

== Causes ==
The origins of Chartism in Wales can be traced to the foundation, in the autumn of 1836, of the Carmarthen Working Men&#x27;s Association.

Among the factors that precipitated the rising were the House of Commons&#x27; rejection of the first Chartist petition for democracy, in the People&#x27;s Charter of 1838 (which called for universal suffrage, secret ballot, a salary for MPs, giving those who did not own property the right to vote, etc.) on 12 July 1839, and the conviction of the Chartist Henry Vincent for unlawful assembly and conspiracy on 2 August.

Some kind of rising had been in preparation for a few months and the march had been gathering momentum over the course of the whole weekend, as John Frost and his associates led their followers down from the industrialised valley towns to the north of Newport. Some of the miners who joined the rising had armed themselves with home-made pikes, bludgeons and firearms.

A column was headed by Frost who led it into Newport from the west, Zephaniah Williams led a column from Blackwood to the northwest and William Jones led a column from Pontypool to the north.

The exact rationale for the confrontation remains opaque, although it may have its origins in Frost&#x27;s ambivalence towards the more violent attitudes of some Chartists, and the personal animus he bore towards some of the Newport establishment. The Chartist movement in southeast Wales was chaotic in this period and the feelings of the workers were running extremely high.

== Events leading up to the Rising ==
Heavy rainfall delayed the Chartists and there were delays in the planned meeting of each contingent at the Welsh Oak in Rogerstone. Jones and his men from Pontypool in fact never arrived, delaying the final march into Newport into the daylight hours, which might have prevented further deaths at the hands of the soldiers. As the columns progressed down the valleys on the Sunday morning, even one entire chapel congregation willingly joined, swelling the ranks of the Chartists.

After spending Sunday night mostly out of doors in the rain, the commitment of many of the Chartists was tested. Many had allegedly been ambivalent to the Chartist cause in the first place, more concerned with the immediate problems of their own employment conditions. Thus many Chartists did not participate in the final rising in Newport and simply waited in the outskirts of the town.

Rumours of a possible Chartist rising and alleged violence elsewhere, following the earlier arrest of Chartist leader Henry Vincent and his imprisonment at the gaol in Monmouth, meant that the authorities expected there might be a riot. The sheer scale of the rising, however was not fully appreciated until 3 November, the day before the rising. The authorities quickly prepared. The Mayor of Newport Thomas Phillips had sworn in 500 Special Constables and asked for more troops to be sent. There were about 60 soldiers stationed in Newport already, and he gathered 32 soldiers of the 45th (Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot in the Westgate Hotel where the Chartist prisoners were held.

== Climax of the Rising ==
It is estimated that nearly 10,000 Chartist sympathisers marched on the town. The Chartists were convinced that some of their fellows had been imprisoned at the Westgate Hotel. Filing quickly down the steep Stow Hill, the Chartists arrived at the small square in front of the hotel at about 9.30 am. It is unclear whether the Chartists knew that the hotel was defended by soldiers, who had only arrived at the hotel shortly before their march on the town began. 

The flash point came when the Chartists, who had surrounded the hotel arranged in regular order, demanded the release of those imprisoned inside, when one side or the other (it is not known which) began firing. A brief, violent and bloody battle ensued. The soldiers defending the hotel despite being greatly outnumbered by the large and very angry crowd, had vastly superior firepower. As many as 80 shots were fired by the Chartists into the hotel, and the Chartists did manage to enter the building temporarily, but were forced to retreat in disarray. After a fiercely fought battle, lasting approximately half an hour, between 10 and 24 of their number had been killed and upwards of 50 had been wounded.

Amongst the defenders of the hotel, Mayor Thomas Phillips was badly wounded, shot in the arm and groin whilst calling on the Chartists to lay down their arms, and one soldier was seriously hurt, along with two of the special constables. Another of the defenders, Sergeant James Daily, had received six slugs to the head. As the chartists fled they abandoned many of their weapons, a selection of which can still be seen in Newport Museum.

Some of the Chartist dead were buried in St. Woolos parish church (now Newport Cathedral) in the town where there is still a plaque to their memory. An urban myth persists that some of the bullet holes from the skirmish remained in the masonry of the hotel entrance porch until well into modern times. In reality the Westgate Hotel has been rebuilt since the uprising. The &quot;bullet holes&quot; may be bomb damage from the Second World War.

==Westgate Hotel First Shots Question==
Sources differ as to who opened fire first, and for what reason. Edward Patton, a carpenter who gave testimony at the trial of John Frost and who claimed not to be a Chartist but instead merely an observer present at the scene to &quot;see what happened&quot;, claimed that he did not know who fired first, but that it was &quot;likely enough that firing began from inside the Westgate Hotel&quot;. R.G. Gammage, a Chartist who disapproved of violence, claimed in his 1854 history of the Chartist movement that some of the crowd had fired through the windows before the soldiers returned their fire. Thomas Bevan Oliver, a special constable guarding the door of the hotel, claimed that he had bumped the door against the gun of one of the Chartists, accidentally discharging it.

== Aftermath ==

In the aftermath 200 or more Chartists were arrested for being involved and twenty-one were charged with high treason. All three main leaders of the rising, John Frost, Zephaniah Williams, and William Jones, were found guilty on the charge of high treason and were sentenced at the Shire Hall in Monmouth to be hanged, drawn and quartered. They were to be the last people to be sentenced to this punishment in England and Wales.

After a nationwide petitioning campaign and, extraordinarily, direct lobbying of the Home Secretary by the Lord Chief Justice the government eventually commuted the sentences of each to transportation for life. Other Chartists involved in some way included James Stephens, John Lovell, John Rees and William Price, and according to some accounts Allan Pinkerton.

Testimonies exist from contemporaries, such as the Yorkshire Chartist Ben Wilson, that a successful rising at Newport was to have been the signal for a national uprising. Older histories suggested that Chartism slipped into a period of internal division after Newport. In fact the movement was remarkably buoyant (and remained so until late 1842). Initially, while the majority of Chartists, under the leadership of Feargus O&#x27;Connor, concentrated on petitioning for Frost, Williams and Jones to be pardoned, significant minorities in Sheffield, East End of London and Bradford planned their own risings in response. Samuel Holberry led an aborted rising in Sheffield on 12 January; police action thwarted a major disturbance in the East End of London on 14 January, and on 26 January a few hundred Bradford Chartists staged a rising in the hope of precipitating a domino effect across the country. After this Chartism turned to a process of internal renewal and more systematic organisation, but the transported and imprisoned Newport Chartists were regarded as heroes and martyrs amongst workers.

Meanwhile, the Establishment and middle classes became convinced that the rising meant all Chartists were dangerously violent. Newport Mayor Thomas Phillips was proclaimed a national hero for his part in crushing the rising and was knighted by Queen Victoria barely six weeks later.

Frost himself was eventually given an unconditional pardon in 1856 and allowed to return to Britain, receiving a triumphant welcome in Newport. But he never lived in Newport again, settling instead in Stapleton near Bristol, where he continued to publish articles advocating reform until his death, aged 93, in 1877.

== Commemoration ==
Interest in the Newport Rising was kept alive through occasional articles in the &quot;Monmouthshire Merlin&quot; and &quot;South Wales Argus&quot;. In 1939, to commemorate the centenary of the Rising, Newport Borough Council erected a plaque on the Post Office building near the birthplace of John Frost. In the 1960s, redevelopment of Newport led to the creation of a central square which was named John Frost Square. The Chartist mural (see below) was situated in an underpass leading to the square. Newport Museum has a display relating to the uprising which includes homemade weapons. In 1991 three statues, &#x27;Union, Prudence, Energy&#x27; by Christopher Kelly, commemorating the uprising were installed on Commercial Street at the front of the Westgate Hotel. In 2015 it was announced that Duffryn High School was to be renamed John Frost School. An annual &#x27;Chartist Convention&#x27; is held in the city.

Commemorative sites in other communities includes a 26 ft tall statue of a Chartist designed by Sebastian Boyson, erected by Caerphilly County Borough Council near the Chartist Bridge at Blackwood. The Shire Hall in Monmouth, scene of the Chartist trial in 1840, has a preserved courtroom and displays relating to the trial. A plaque commemorating the departure of Frost, Williams and Jones from Chepstow by ship to Portsmouth on the first stage of their transportation
voyage is situated on the Chepstow river front.

=== John Frost Square mural ===

In the 1960s, as part of a redevelopment scheme, a new square was named John Frost Square to commemorate the leader of the Rising, and in 1978 a long mosaic mural, by Kenneth Budd, was created in a pedestrian underpass in the square. In 2007, an introductory panel was removed, and it was proposed that, as part of a further redevelopment scheme, the mural would be removed. Proposals to demolish the mural were restated in 2012. Despite a campaign to protect the mural, the council&#x27;s contractors demolished it on 3 October 2013. A trust is to be set up to commission a new memorial with £50,000 of funding provided by Newport City Council.

On 4 November 2019, exactly 180 years since the Chartist uprising, a new mural was unveiled. The new mural is a copy of the original, but smaller and in four panels. It was created by Oliver Budd, son of the original mural&#x27;s creator. The panels are located on Cefn Road, Rogerstone. It also includes an information board telling the history of Chartism.

==In popular culture==
In literature, the events of the Rising have been portrayed in:
*John Watkins&#x27;s 1841 play &quot;John Frost: A Chartist Play, in Five Acts&quot;
*James Augustus St John&#x27;s 1843 novel &quot;Sir Cosmo Digby, a novel of the Monmouthshire Riots&quot;
*Alexander Cordell&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;Rape of the Fair Country&quot; 
*Vivien Annis Bailey&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;Children of Rebecca&quot; published by Honno 

The track &quot;Ballad of Solomon Jones&quot; by Jon Langford on albums &quot;Skull Orchard Revisited&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Legend of LL&quot; (2015) is partially set during the Newport Rising.

The track &quot;The View from Stow Hill&quot;, on the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; 2014 album &quot;Futurology&quot;, written by bassist Nicky Wire, was based on the events of the Newport Rising.

The 2016 ITV biographical TV series &quot;Victoria&quot; offers a fictionalised account of the Newport Rising in which Queen Victoria is depicted as ordering the drawing and quartering of the ringleaders to be commuted to transportation to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania) after learning that one of the men is the nephew of a member of her household staff. The commutation is intended as a signal to the people that her reign is to be a merciful one.

In August 2019, in the BBC TV series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, Thomas Jones Phillips, a solicitor at the time of the Rising, was revealed to be an ancestor of TV producer Michael Whitehall and of his son, actor and comedian Jack Whitehall.

In August 2022, the Welsh ragga metal band Dub War released the album Westgate Under Fire, inspired by the events of the Newport Rising.

The 2024 book &#x27;The Puzzle Wood&#x27; by Rosie Andrews includes references to the Newport Rising.

<text>″s gibt nur a Kaiserstadt, &#x27;s gibt nur a Wien! is a polka written by Johann Strauss II in 1864. The title of this polka was inspired from the waltz duet in the Singspiel (musical comedy) &quot;Aline&quot; by Adolf Bäuerle with music by Wenzel Müller first performed at the Theater in der Leopoldstadt on 9 October 1822. The song titled &quot;&quot; was a hit during its day whereas its refrain (Yes, only one Imperial City, yes only one Vienna!) became a popular household phrase.

While Stauss adapts no music from the stage work, he did incorporate Haydn&#x27;s Austrian Hymn &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot; into the finale of the polka. Strauss first performed the work during a lucrative Russian tour at Pavlovsk where he frequently performed at the Vauxhall Pavilion. At his penultimate concert there on 8 October 1864 (Russian calendar 26 September), he performed the work under its original title &quot;&quot; (Forget Me Not). For his audiences back home in Vienna, he retitled the work and performed it on 4 December 1864 at a festive concert at the Vienna Volksgarten to celebrate his 20th anniversary of his public début at .

<doc id="1277655" wikidata="Q4998355" url="?curid=1277655" title="Bureau of Colored Troops">
<text>The Bureau of Colored Troops was created by the United States War Department on May 22, 1863, under General Order No. 143, during the Civil War, to handle &quot;all matters relating to the organization of colored troops.&quot; Major Charles Warren Foster was chief of the Bureau, which reported to Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. The designation United States Colored Troops replaced the varied state titles that had been given to the African-American soldiers.

== Origins and recruitment ==
The first official authorization to employ African Americans in federal service was the Second Confiscation and Militia Act of July 17, 1862. This act allowed President Abraham Lincoln to receive into the military service persons of African descent and gave permission to use them for any purpose &quot;he may judge best for the public welfare.&quot; However, the President did not authorize use of African Americans in combat until issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863: &quot;And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.&quot; With these words the Union army changed.

During the American Civil War, in mid-1863, the administrative load became so burdensome that the War Department decided to create a single entity under the umbrella of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Office, called the Bureau of Colored Troops, to manage its affairs. Headed by Major Charles Warren Foster, the bureau was to systematize the process of raising black units and securing officers for them. It also served as a clearinghouse of information on these units. Over the course of the next year, the War Department began to change the names of black commands. Instead of state designations, they became United States Colored Troops, and the various units became United States Colored Infantry, Artillery, or Cavalry.

== Racial segregation and treatment ==
The Bureau of Colored Troops brought efficiency to the USCT regiments, but not always equitable treatment. Despite objections from black leaders, the Bureau insisted on assigning only white men to commissioned officer positions. Although a small number of black soldiers received commissions by the end of the war—including the Virginia-born Martin R. Delany—and many served as non commissioned officers, the USCT remained primarily an organization led by whites. Officials in the army and in the government also initially assumed that black regiments would rarely, if ever, be used in combat. As a result, black soldiers endured a disproportionate share of labor duty. Also the assumption that black soldiers were workers, not fighters, led to inequities in pay. It was initially indicated that black soldiers would be paid $13 per month, which was the wage that white soldiers received. But in the Militia Act of 1862, Congress set the pay for black soldiers at $10 per month, $3 of which could be in clothing, which was the rate for military laborers. Black soldiers were also often denied recruitment bounties routinely offered to white soldiers, and were rarely eligible to collect aid for dependents, a benefit that state legislation often made available to white men serving in the ranks.

== Major supporters ==
After the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, black recruitment was pursued in earnest. Volunteers from South Carolina, Tennessee, and Massachusetts filled the first authorized black regiments. However recruitment was slow until the support of prominent figures of African American cultures such as Frederick Douglass and Martin Delany. Martin Delany was commissioned as a major, the first African-American field officer in the United States Army during the American Civil War and was active in recruiting black men for the United States Colored Troops. Frederick Douglass, on the other hand, encouraged black men to become soldiers to ensure eventual full citizenship. Volunteers began to respond, and in May 1863 the Government established the Bureau of Colored Troops to manage the burgeoning numbers of black soldiers.

<text>Saltburn-by-the-Sea, commonly referred to as Saltburn, is a seaside town in the civil parish of Saltburn, Marske and New Marske, in the Redcar and Cleveland unitary authority, in North Yorkshire, England. It is south-east of Hartlepool and south-east of Redcar. It lies within the historic boundaries of the North Riding of Yorkshire.

The development of Saltburn was driven by the discovery of ironstone in the Cleveland Hills and building of railways to transport the minerals.

== Demographics ==

In 1961, the parish had a population of 5,708. The town itself had a population of 5,958 in 2011.

==History==
Saltburn was formerly in the parish of Brotton, however, after 1894 Saltburn by the Sea became a separate civil parish, being formed from the part of Marske parish in Saltburn by the Sea Urban District. Saltburn by the Sea Urban District was also formed in 1894.

On 1 April 1932, the urban district was abolished to form Saltburn and Marske By the Sea Urban District. The original civil parish was also abolished on 1 April 1974 to form &quot;Saltburn and Marske by the Sea&quot;.

===Old Saltburn===
Old Saltburn is the original settlement, located in the Saltburn Gill. Records are scarce on its origins, but it was a centre for smugglers, and publican John Andrew is referred to as &#x27;king of smugglers&#x27;.

In 1856, the hamlet consisted of the Ship Inn and a row of houses, occupied by farmers and fishermen.
In the mid-18th century, authors Laurence Sterne and John Hall-Stevenson enjoyed racing chariots on the sands at Saltburn.

===Victorian era===
The Pease family of Darlington developed Middlesbrough as an industrial centre and, after discovery of iron stone, the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway and the West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway Company developed routes into East Cleveland. By 1861, the S&amp;DR reached Saltburn with the intention of continuing to Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus; but the WHH&amp;RCo had already developed tracks in the area, leaving little point in extending the S&amp;DR tracks further.

In 1858, while walking along the coast path towards Old Saltburn to visit his brother Joseph in Marske-by-the-Sea, Henry Pease saw &quot;a prophetic vision of a town arising on the cliff and the quiet, unfrequented and sheltered glen turned into a lovely garden&quot;.

The Pease family owned Middlesbrough Estate and had control of the S&amp;DR, and agreed to develop Henry&#x27;s vision by forming the Saltburn Improvement Company (SIC). Land was purchased from the Earl of Zetland, and the company commissioned surveyor George Dickinson to lay out what became an interpretation of a gridiron street layout, although this was interrupted by the railway which ran through the site. With as many houses as possible having sea views, the so-called &quot;Jewel streets&quot; along the seafront—Coral, Garnet, Ruby, Emerald, Pearl, Diamond and Amber Streets, said to be a legacy of Henry&#x27;s vision, were additional to the grid pattern.

After securing the best positions for development by the SIC, money was raised for construction by selling plots to private developers and investors. Most buildings are constructed using &#x27;Pease&#x27; brick, transported from Darlington by the S&amp;DR, with the name &quot;Pease&quot; set into the brick. The jewel in Henry Pease&#x27;s crown is said to have been The Zetland Hotel with a private platform, one of the world&#x27;s earliest railway hotels.

The parcel of land known as Clifton Villas was sold by the SIC in 1865 to William Morley from London who built the property, &#x27;The Cottage&#x27; (now Teddy&#x27;s Nook) on a site originally intended for three villas. The SIC stipulated in the deed of covenant that &quot;any trees planted along Britannia Terrace (now Marine Parade) were not to exceed 1&#x27; 6&quot; above the footpath&quot; (46 cm) to preserve sea views for Britannia Terrace residents and visitors.

The Redcar to Saltburn Railway opened in 1861 as an extension of the Middlesbrough to Redcar Railway of 1846. The line was extended to Whitby as part of the Whitby Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway.

== Geography ==
The coastline at Saltburn lies practically east–west, and along much of it runs Marine Parade. To the east of the town is the imposing Hunt Cliff, topped by Warsett Hill at . Skelton Beck runs through the wooded Valley Gardens in Saltburn, then alongside Saltburn Miniature Railway before being joined by Saltburn Gill going under the A174 road bridge and entering the North Sea across the sandy beach. The A174 road number is now used for the Skelton/Brotton Bypass.

== Landmarks ==

A forest walk in the Valley Gardens gives access to the Italian Gardens and leads on to the railway viaduct.
On the shore of Old Saltburn stands the Ship Inn, which dates to the 17th century.
In the town there are plenty of Victorian buildings.
There is also a thriving local theatre, &quot;The 53 Society&quot;, and a public library.

===Cliff lift===
The Saltburn Cliff Lift is one of the world&#x27;s oldest water-powered funiculars—the oldest being the Bom Jesus funicular in Braga, Portugal.
After the opening of Saltburn Pier in February 1869, it was concluded that the steep cliff walk was deterring people from walking from the town to the pier.
After the company was taken over by Middlesbrough Estates in 1883, they discovered that the wooden Cliff Hoist had a number of rotten supports.

The Saltburn tramway, as it is also known, was developed by Sir Richard Tangye&#x27;s company, whose chief engineer was George Croydon Marks. The cliff tramway opened a year later and provided transport between the pier and the town. The railway is water-balanced and since 1924 the water pump has been electrically operated. The first major maintenance was carried out in 1998, when the main winding wheel was replaced and a new braking system was installed.

===Pier===

Saltburn&#x27;s attractions include a Grade II* renovated pier, the only pleasure pier on the whole of the North East and Yorkshire coast.

===Miniature railway ===

The Saltburn Miniature Railway is a gauge railway that runs south from &quot;Cat Nab Station&quot; close to the beach, for about ½ mile inland to &quot;Forest Halt&quot;, where there is a woodland walk and the Italian Gardens.

=== Public houses ===
As the town had been founded by Quakers, the SIC had a ban on public houses. Alcohol was served in the hotels and the bars attached to them, and in private members&#x27; clubs, which included; Ruby Street Social Club (formerly The British Legion; now demolished), Lune Street Social Club (Top Club), Milton Street Social Club (Bottom Club), The Red Lodge, The Conservative Club, Saltburn Golf Club, Saltburn Cricket, Tennis and Bowls Club and The Queens (known locally as The Swingdoors).

Saltburn&#x27;s first public house (independent of an existing hotel) was The Victoria, opened on 8 December 1982.

Today the following public houses exist in Saltburn: Alexandra Vaults (known locally as Back Alex), The Victoria, The Marine, The Ship Inn, Vista Mar and The Hop and Vine (formerly Windsor&#x27;s).

=== Teddy&#x27;s Nook (The Cottage) ===
Teddy&#x27;s Nook is a house built in 1862 by Henry Pease, a director of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, for his own occupation.
Pease was responsible for the foundation of the seaside resort and the sturdy sandstone house was first named &quot;The Cottage&quot;.

Lillie Langtry—&quot;The Jersey Lily&quot;, stayed at the house at sometime between 1877 and 1880. She was often visited by Edward Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the United Kingdom) who had a suite of rooms at the Zetland Hotel.
The cottage, consequently, became known as Teddy&#x27;s Nook.

The Cottage was only one of four similar houses to be called &quot;Clifton Villas&quot;.
The cottage was the family home of Audrey Collins, MBE, who served as Mayor of Saltburn and chair of the South Tees Health Authority. Middlesbrough&#x27;s James Cook University Hospital has named a teaching unit in her name.

=== Saltburn Valley Woods ===

Locally known as Fairy Glen, the Saltburn Valley Woods run through Saltburn Beck. Places in these woods include the Stepping Stones and the Saltburn Viaduct.

== Education ==
Saltburn&#x27;s only secondary school is Huntcliff School which was rebuilt during 2007–8, re-opening on 8 September 2008. The redundant 50-year-old school buildings were then demolished to allow the town&#x27;s Junior and Infant schools to relocate to the same site in 2009 because the Junior and Infant schools used to be located in a different building, not in the campus area.

== History of education ==
In the early 1900s the building where the Earthbeat Centre is now located was a girls grammar school, and later a primary school until 2009. &quot;After many months of intensive renovation the former Saltburn School has now opened its doors to the public as the Earthbeat Centre.&quot; The site is now the home of the Earthbeat Centre, with a fifty-year lease that began in 2015.

== Transport ==

Saltburn railway station is at the end of the Tees Valley Line from and .
Beyond Saltburn a mineral goods line continues across Saltburn Viaduct and the edge of Hunt Cliff to the potash mine at nearby Boulby.

There are now only three buses an hour to Redcar and Middlesbrough and two an hour to Loftus and Whitby. There was an infrequent direct bus service to Guisborough and Stokesley, Monday to Friday only, but this was withdrawn in January 2023.New Services(1 and 2) were introduced in 2023. These run every seven minutes but are little used as the routes seem to suit very few people.

== Sport ==

Sports played in Saltburn include cricket, bowls and tennis also played at the Club in Marske Mill Lane.
The club has existed for over 100 years and is nearly as old as the town itself.
New facilities were provided in 2002 with financial help from the Lottery. The Saltburn Cricket Club play in the NYSD league.

The North Riding Duck Race is held each year on 1 August to celebrate Yorkshire Day.
The winner receives the Colin Holt Cup, named in honour of the late Colin Holt, for many years the Chairman of the Yorkshire Ridings Society. A prize is given also for the duck with the most original name.

The coastline is known for national surfing events held during the autumn and winter months, attracting competitors from England, Scotland and Wales.

== Culture and events ==

Annual events include the Saltburn Custom Classic Car Show—a lower prom display of mostly American cars—and the Saltburn Festival of Folk Music, Dance and Song.

<text>Johan Tobias Sergel (; 7 September 1740 in Stockholm – 26 February 1814 in Stockholm) was a Swedish neoclassical sculptor. Sergels torg, the largest square in the centre of Stockholm and near where his workshop stood, is named after him.

==Life==

Johan Tobias Sergel was born in Stockholm in 1740. He was the son of the decorator, Christoffer Sergel and Elisabet (née Swyrner), and was the brother of the decorator, Anna Brita Sergel. His first teacher was Pierre Hubert Larchevêsque. After studying in Paris, he went to Rome, where he moved in the same circles as the painters Alexander Runciman and James Barry. He stayed in Rome for twelve years and sculpted a number of groups in marble. Besides subjects from classical mythology such as the &quot;Diomedes Stealing the Palladium&quot;, which he sold to the British collector, Thomas Mansel Talbot, in 1772, he also sculpted a colossal representation of &quot;The Muse of History Recording the Deeds of Gustavus Adolphus&quot;, in which are depicted the achievements of King Gustav II Adolf before the Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna. It was in Rome also that he modelled the statue of King Gustav III, subsequently cast in bronze and purchased by the city of Stockholm in 1796. While primarily a sculptor, Sergel (inspired by English artists like Thomas Rowlandson) also drew sequential picture stories, an early form of comic strip.
Summoned by Gustav III, Sergel returned to Stockholm in 1779 and continued to work there. Among the monuments he created at this time are a tomb for Gustav Vasa, a monument to Descartes, and a large relief in the church of St. Clarens, representing the Resurrection. He was an important part of the artistic elite in Stockholm, drawing a portrait of Sweden&#x27;s bard Carl Michael Bellman among others. He had a relationship with the celebrated actress Fredrique Löwen and was possibly the father of one of her children. He died in his native city on 26 February 1814.

==Works==
Among his works in the Nationalmuseum in Blasieholmen, central Stockholm are his monumental sculptures &quot;Diomedes Stealing the Palladium&quot;, &quot;The Muse of History Recording the Deeds of Gustavus Adolphus&quot;, and a &quot;Bust of Gustavus III&quot;.

<text>Clarence Walker Barron (July 2, 1855 – October 2, 1928) was an American financial editor and publisher who founded the Dow Jones financial journal, &quot;Barron&#x27;s National Financial Weekly&quot;, later renamed &quot;Barron&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. 

He was one of the most influential figures in the history of Dow Jones. As a career newsman described as a &quot;short, rotund powerhouse&quot;, he died holding the posts of president of Dow Jones and &quot;de facto&quot; manager of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He is considered the founder of modern financial journalism.

==Early life and education==
Barron was born in Boston and graduated from Boston English High School in 1873.

==Career==
Barron began his journalism career as a reporter for the &quot;Boston Daily News&quot; from 1875 to 1878 and the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; from 1878 to 1887. At the &quot;Transcript&quot;, Barron gradually focused on financial news. He founded the Boston News Bureau in 1887 and the Philadelphia News Bureau in 1897, supplying financial news to brokers. Barron sought to improve objectivity in financial journalism to reflect what he called &quot;the public interest, the financial truth for investors and the funds that should support the widow and the orphan.&quot;

In 1902, Barron purchased Dow Jones &amp; Company for $130,000, following the death of co-founder Charles Dow. In 1912, he appointed himself president of Dow Jones and its newspaper &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Under Barron, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; gained new printing presses and expanded reporting staff, with circulation increasing from 7,000 in 1912 to over 18,000 in 1920 to beyond 50,000 by 1930. 

In 1913, he gave testimony to the Massachusetts Public Service Commission regarding a slush fund held by the New Haven Railroad. In 1920, he investigated Charles Ponzi, inventor of the Ponzi scheme, for &quot;The Boston Post&quot;. His aggressive questioning and commonsense reasoning helped lead to Ponzi&#x27;s arrest and conviction.

Barron also established the financial advertising agency Doremus &amp; Co. in 1903. In 1921, he founded the Dow Jones financial journal, &quot;Barron&#x27;s National Financial Weekly&quot;, later renamed &quot;Barron&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and served as its first editor. He priced the magazine at 10 cents an issue and saw circulation explode to 30,000 by 1926, with high popularity among investors and financiers.

==Personal life==
Barron married Jessie M. Waldron in 1900 and adopted her daughters, Jane and Martha. Mrs. Barron died in 1918. After Jane married Hugh Bancroft in 1907, Jane Barron became a prominent member of the Boston Brahmin Bancroft family. Martha Barron married H. Wendell Endicott, heir apparent to the Endicott Shoe Company. Mr. and Mrs. Barron and the Endicotts are buried in a joint family plot at the historic Forest Hills Cemetery in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.

Barron was a prominent lay member of the Massachusetts New Church (Swedenborgians).

Barron died in 1928 in Battle Creek, Michigan.

== Legacy ==
After his death, Barron&#x27;s responsibilities were split between his son-in-law Hugh Bancroft, who became president of Dow Jones, and his friend Kenneth C. Hogate, who became the managing editor of the &quot;Journal&quot;.

&quot;They Told Barron&quot; (1930) and &quot;More They Told Barron&quot; (1931), two books edited by Arthur Pound and S. T. Moore were published that showed his close connections and his role as a confidant to top financiers from New York City society, such as Charles M. Schwab. As a result, he has been called &quot;the diarist of the American Dream.&quot; (Reutter 148) This has led to allegations that he was too close to those he covered.

The Bancroft family remained the majority shareholder of Dow Jones &amp; Company until July 31, 2007, when Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp. won the support of 32 percent of the Dow Jones voting shares controlled by the Bancroft family, enough to ensure a comfortable margin of victory.

<text>In differential geometry, a &quot;G&quot;-structure on an &quot;n&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot;, for a given structure group &quot;G&quot;, is a principal &quot;G&quot;-subbundle of the tangent frame bundle F&quot;M&quot; (or GL(&quot;M&quot;)) of &quot;M&quot;.

The notion of &quot;G&quot;-structures includes various classical structures that can be defined on manifolds, which in some cases are tensor fields. For example, for the orthogonal group, an O(&quot;n&quot;)-structure defines a Riemannian metric, and for the special linear group an SL(&quot;n&quot;,R)-structure is the same as a volume form. For the trivial group, an {&quot;e&quot;}-structure consists of an absolute parallelism of the manifold.

Generalising this idea to arbitrary principal bundles on topological spaces, one can ask if a principal formula_1-bundle over a group formula_1 &quot;comes from&quot; a subgroup formula_3 of formula_1. This is called reduction of the structure group (to formula_3).

Several structures on manifolds, such as a complex structure, a symplectic structure, or a Kähler structure, are &quot;G&quot;-structures with an additional integrability condition.

==Reduction of the structure group==
One can ask if a principal formula_1-bundle over a group formula_1 &quot;comes from&quot; a subgroup formula_3 of formula_1. This is called reduction of the structure group (to formula_3), and makes sense for any map formula_11, which need not be an inclusion map (despite the terminology).

=== Definition ===
In the following, let formula_12 be a topological space, formula_13 topological groups and a group homomorphism formula_14.

==== In terms of concrete bundles ====
Given a principal formula_1-bundle formula_16 over formula_12, a &quot;reduction of the structure group&quot; (from formula_1 to formula_3) is a &quot;formula_3&quot;-bundle formula_21 and an isomorphism formula_22 of the associated bundle to the original bundle.

==== In terms of classifying spaces ====
Given a map formula_23, where formula_24 is the classifying space for formula_1-bundles, a &quot;reduction of the structure group&quot; is a map formula_26 and a homotopy formula_27.

=== Properties and examples ===
Reductions of the structure group do not always exist. If they exist, they are usually not essentially unique, since the isomorphism formula_28 is an important part of the data.

As a concrete example, every even-dimensional real vector space is isomorphic to the underlying real space of a complex vector space: it admits a linear complex structure. A real vector bundle admits an almost complex structure if and only if it is isomorphic to the underlying real bundle of a complex vector bundle. This is then a reduction along the inclusion &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,C) → &quot;GL&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;,R)

In terms of transition maps, a &quot;G&quot;-bundle can be reduced if and only if the transition maps can be taken to have values in &quot;H&quot;. Note that the term &quot;reduction&quot; is misleading: it suggests that &quot;H&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, which is often the case, but need not be (for example for spin structures): it&#x27;s properly called a lifting.

More abstractly, &quot;&quot;G&quot;-bundles over &quot;X&quot;&quot; is a functor in &quot;G&quot;: Given a Lie group homomorphism &quot;H&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, one gets a map from &quot;H&quot;-bundles to &quot;G&quot;-bundles by inducing (as above). Reduction of the structure group of a &quot;G&quot;-bundle &quot;B&quot; is choosing an &quot;H&quot;-bundle whose image is &quot;B&quot;.

The inducing map from &quot;H&quot;-bundles to &quot;G&quot;-bundles is in general neither onto nor one-to-one, so the structure group cannot always be reduced, and when it can, this reduction need not be unique. For example, not every manifold is orientable, and those that are orientable admit exactly two orientations.

If &quot;H&quot; is a closed subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, then there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between reductions of a &quot;G&quot;-bundle &quot;B&quot; to &quot;H&quot; and global sections of the fiber bundle &quot;B&quot;/&quot;H&quot; obtained by quotienting &quot;B&quot; by the right action of &quot;H&quot;. Specifically, the fibration &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is a principal &quot;H&quot;-bundle over &quot;B&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. If σ : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;B&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is a section, then the pullback bundle &quot;B&quot;H = σ−1&quot;B&quot; is a reduction of &quot;B&quot;.

== &quot;G&quot;-structures ==
Every vector bundle of dimension formula_29 has a canonical formula_30-bundle, the frame bundle. In particular, every smooth manifold has a canonical vector bundle, the tangent bundle. For a Lie group formula_1 and a group homomorphism formula_32, a formula_1-structure is a reduction of the structure group of the frame bundle to formula_1.

=== Examples ===
The following examples are defined for real vector bundles, particularly the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold.

Some formula_1-structures are defined in terms of others: Given a Riemannian metric on an oriented manifold, a formula_1-structure for the 2-fold cover formula_37 is a spin structure. (Note that the group homomorphism here is &quot;not&quot; an inclusion.)

=== Principal bundles ===
Although the theory of principal bundles plays an important role in the study of &quot;G&quot;-structures, the two notions are different. A &quot;G&quot;-structure is a principal subbundle of the tangent frame bundle, but the fact that the &quot;G&quot;-structure bundle &quot;consists of tangent frames&quot; is regarded as part of the data. For example, consider two Riemannian metrics on R&quot;n&quot;. The associated O(&quot;n&quot;)-structures are isomorphic if and only if the metrics are isometric. But, since R&quot;n&quot; is contractible, the underlying O(&quot;n&quot;)-bundles are always going to be isomorphic as principal bundles because the only bundles over contractible spaces are trivial bundles.

This fundamental difference between the two theories can be captured by giving an additional piece of data on the underlying &quot;G&quot;-bundle of a &quot;G&quot;-structure: the solder form. The solder form is what ties the underlying principal bundle of the &quot;G&quot;-structure to the local geometry of the manifold itself by specifying a canonical isomorphism of the tangent bundle of &quot;M&quot; to an associated vector bundle. Although the solder form is not a connection form, it can sometimes be regarded as a precursor to one.

In detail, suppose that &quot;Q&quot; is the principal bundle of a &quot;G&quot;-structure. If &quot;Q&quot; is realized as a reduction of the frame bundle of &quot;M&quot;, then the solder form is given by the pullback of the tautological form of the frame bundle along the inclusion. Abstractly, if one regards &quot;Q&quot; as a principal bundle independently of its realization as a reduction of the frame bundle, then the solder form consists of a representation ρ of &quot;G&quot; on Rn and an isomorphism of bundles θ : &quot;TM&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; ×ρ Rn.

== Integrability conditions and flat &quot;G&quot;-structures ==
Several structures on manifolds, such as a complex structure, a symplectic structure, or a Kähler structure, are &quot;G&quot;-structures (and thus can be obstructed), but need to satisfy an additional integrability condition. Without the corresponding integrability condition, the structure is instead called an &quot;almost&quot; structure, as in an almost complex structure, an almost symplectic structure, or an almost Kähler structure.

Specifically, a symplectic manifold structure is a stronger concept than a &quot;G&quot;-structure for the symplectic group. A symplectic structure on a manifold is a 2-form &quot;ω&quot; on &quot;M&quot; that is non-degenerate (which is an formula_38-structure, or almost symplectic structure), &quot;together with&quot; the extra condition that d&quot;ω&quot; = 0; this latter is called an integrability condition.

Similarly, foliations correspond to &quot;G&quot;-structures coming from block matrices, together with integrability conditions so that the Frobenius theorem applies.

A flat &quot;G&quot;-structure is a &quot;G&quot;-structure &quot;P&quot; having a global section (&quot;V&quot;1...,&quot;V&quot;n) consisting of commuting vector fields. A &quot;G&quot;-structure is integrable (or &quot;locally flat&quot;) if it is locally isomorphic to a flat &quot;G&quot;-structure.

== Isomorphism of &quot;G&quot;-structures ==
The set of diffeomorphisms of &quot;M&quot; that preserve a &quot;G&quot;-structure is called the &quot;automorphism group&quot; of that structure. For an O(&quot;n&quot;)-structure they are the group of isometries of the Riemannian metric and for an SL(&quot;n&quot;,R)-structure volume preserving maps.

Let &quot;P&quot; be a &quot;G&quot;-structure on a manifold &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; a &quot;G&quot;-structure on a manifold &quot;N&quot;. Then an isomorphism of the &quot;G&quot;-structures is a diffeomorphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;M&quot; → &quot;N&quot; such that the pushforward of linear frames &quot;f&quot;* : &quot;FM&quot; → &quot;FN&quot; restricts to give a mapping of &quot;P&quot; into &quot;Q&quot;. (Note that it is sufficient that &quot;Q&quot; be contained within the image of &quot;f&quot;*.) The &quot;G&quot;-structures &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are locally isomorphic if &quot;M&quot; admits a covering by open sets &quot;U&quot; and a family of diffeomorphisms &quot;f&quot;U : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;f&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) ⊂ &quot;N&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;U induces an isomorphism of &quot;P&quot;|U → &quot;Q&quot;|&quot;f&quot;(&quot;U&quot;).

An automorphism of a &quot;G&quot;-structure is an isomorphism of a &quot;G&quot;-structure &quot;P&quot; with itself. Automorphisms arise frequently in the study of transformation groups of geometric structures, since many of the important geometric structures on a manifold can be realized as &quot;G&quot;-structures.

A wide class of equivalence problems can be formulated in the language of &quot;G&quot;-structures. For example, a pair of Riemannian manifolds are (locally) equivalent if and only if their bundles of orthonormal frames are (locally) isomorphic &quot;G&quot;-structures. In this view, the general procedure for solving an equivalence problem is to construct a system of invariants for the &quot;G&quot;-structure which are then sufficient to determine whether a pair of &quot;G&quot;-structures are locally isomorphic or not.

== Connections on &quot;G&quot;-structures ==

Let &quot;Q&quot; be a &quot;G&quot;-structure on &quot;M&quot;. A principal connection on the principal bundle &quot;Q&quot; induces a connection on any associated vector bundle: in particular on the tangent bundle. A linear connection ∇ on &quot;TM&quot; arising in this way is said to be compatible with &quot;Q&quot;. Connections compatible with &quot;Q&quot; are also called adapted connections.

Concretely speaking, adapted connections can be understood in terms of a moving frame. Suppose that &quot;V&quot;i is a basis of local sections of &quot;TM&quot; (i.e., a frame on &quot;M&quot;) which defines a section of &quot;Q&quot;. Any connection ∇ determines a system of basis-dependent 1-forms ω via

:∇X Vi = ωij(X)Vj

where, as a matrix of 1-forms, ω ∈ Ω1(M)⊗gl(&quot;n&quot;). An adapted connection is one for which ω takes its values in the Lie algebra g of &quot;G&quot;.

=== Torsion of a &quot;G&quot;-structure ===
Associated to any &quot;G&quot;-structure is a notion of torsion, related to the torsion of a connection. Note that a given &quot;G&quot;-structure may admit many different compatible connections which in turn can have different torsions, but in spite of this it is possible to give an independent notion of torsion &quot;of the G-structure&quot; as follows.

The difference of two adapted connections is a 1-form on &quot;M&quot; with values in the adjoint bundle Ad&quot;Q&quot;. That is to say, the space &quot;A&quot;&quot;Q&quot; of adapted connections is an affine space
for Ω1(Ad&quot;Q&quot;).

The torsion of an adapted connection defines a map

:formula_39

to 2-forms with coefficients in &quot;TM&quot;. This map is linear; its linearization 

:formula_40

is called the algebraic torsion map. Given two adapted connections ∇ and ∇′, their torsion tensors &quot;T&quot;∇, &quot;T&quot;∇′ differ by τ(∇−∇′). Therefore, the image of &quot;T&quot;∇ in coker(τ) is independent from the choice of ∇.

The image of &quot;T&quot;∇ in coker(τ) for any adapted connection ∇ is called the torsion of the &quot;G&quot;-structure. A &quot;G&quot;-structure is said to be torsion-free if its torsion vanishes. This happens precisely when &quot;Q&quot; admits a torsion-free adapted connection.

=== Example: Torsion for almost complex structures ===

An example of a &quot;G&quot;-structure is an almost complex structure, that is, a reduction
of a structure group of an even-dimensional manifold to GL(&quot;n&quot;,C). Such a reduction is uniquely determined by a &quot;C&quot;∞-linear endomorphism &quot;J&quot; ∈ End(&quot;TM&quot;) such that &quot;J&quot;2 = −1. In this situation, the torsion can be computed explicitly as follows.

An easy dimension count shows that

:formula_41,

where Ω2,0(&quot;TM&quot;) is a space of forms &quot;B&quot; ∈ Ω2(&quot;TM&quot;) which satisfy

:formula_42

Therefore, the torsion of an almost complex structure can be considered as an element in 
Ω2,0(&quot;TM&quot;). It is easy to check that the torsion of an almost complex structure is equal to its Nijenhuis tensor.

== Higher order &quot;G&quot;-structures ==

Imposing integrability conditions on a particular &quot;G&quot;-structure (for instance, with the case of a symplectic form) can be dealt with via the process of prolongation. In such cases, the prolonged &quot;G&quot;-structure cannot be identified with a &quot;G&quot;-subbundle of the bundle of linear frames. In many cases, however, the prolongation is a principal bundle in its own right, and its structure group can be identified with a subgroup of a higher-order jet group. In which case, it is called a higher order &quot;G&quot;-structure [Kobayashi]. In general, Cartan&#x27;s equivalence method applies to such cases.

<text>Herd mentality is the tendency for people’s behavior or beliefs to conform to those of the group they belong to. The concept of herd mentality has been studied and analyzed from different perspectives, including biology, psychology and sociology. This psychological phenomenon can have profound impacts on human behavior.

Social psychologists study the related topics of collective intelligence, crowd wisdom, groupthink, and deindividuation.

== History ==
The idea of a &quot;group mind&quot; or &quot;mob behavior&quot; was first put forward by 19th-century social psychologists Gabriel Tarde and Gustave Le Bon. Herd behavior in human societies has also been studied by Sigmund Freud and Wilfred Trotter, whose book &quot;Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War&quot; is a classic in the field of social psychology. Sociologist and economist Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; illustrates how individuals imitate other group members of higher social status in their consumer behavior. More recently, Malcolm Gladwell in &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, examines how cultural, social, and economic factors converge to create trends in consumer behavior. In 2004, the &quot;New Yorker&quot; financial columnist James Surowiecki published &quot;The Wisdom of Crowds&quot;.

Twenty-first-century academic fields such as marketing and behavioral finance attempt to identify and predict the rational and irrational behavior of investors. (See the work of Daniel Kahneman, Robert Shiller, Vernon L. Smith, and Amos Tversky.) Driven by emotional reactions such as greed and fear, investors can be seen to join in frantic purchasing and sales of stocks, creating bubbles and crashes. As a result, herd behavior is closely studied by behavioral finance experts in order to help predict future economic crises.

==Research==

The Asch conformity experiments (1951) involved a series of studies directed by American Psychologist Solomon Asch that measured the effects of majority group belief and opinion on individuals. Fifty male students from Swarthmore College participated in a vision test with a line judgement task.

A naive participant was put in a room with seven confederates (i.e. actors) who had agreed in advance to match their responses. The participant was not aware of this and was told that the actors were also naive participants. There was one control condition with no confederates. Confederates purposefully gave the wrong answer on 12 trials. The other participant usually went with the group and said the wrong answer.

Through 18 trials total, Asch (1951) found that one third (33%) of naive participants conformed with the clearly incorrect majority, with 75% of participants over the 12 trials. Fewer than 1% of participants gave the wrong answer when there were no confederates.

Researchers at Leeds University performed a group experiment in which volunteers were told to randomly walk around a large hall without talking to each other. A select few were then given more detailed instructions on where to walk. The scientists discovered that people end up blindly following one or two instructed people who appear to know where they are going. The results of this experiment showed that it only takes 5% of confident looking and instructed people to influence the direction of the other 95% of people in the crowd, and the 200 volunteers did this without even realizing it.

Researchers from Hebrew University, NYU, and MIT explored herd mentality in online spaces, specifically in the context of &quot;digitized, aggregated opinions.&quot; Online comments were given an initial positive or negative vote (up or down) on an undisclosed website over five months. The control group comments were left alone.

The researchers found that &quot;the first person reading the comment was 32% more likely to upvote it if it had been already given a fake positive score.&quot; Over the five months, comments artificially rated positively showed a 25% higher average score than the control group, with the initial negative vote ending up with no statistical significance in comparison to the control group. The researchers found that &quot;prior ratings created significant bias in individual rating behavior, and positive and negative social influences created asymmetric herding effects.&quot;

&quot;That is a significant change,&quot; Dr. Aral, one of the researchers involved in the experiment, stated. &quot;We saw how these very small signals of social influence snowballed into behaviors like herding.&quot;

== Theories ==

=== Evolution ===
Evidence of herding in animals, especially monkeys, humankind’s closest relatives suggests that herd mentality has evolutionary roots. Evidence shows that animals acquire information to make important decisions (i.e. where to forage and mating potential) by monitoring the interactions of others with their environment. For instance, imitation in monkeys is the most effective strategy of rapidly transmitting information throughout the species. Accumulating evidence and statistical hypotheses framework developed using a Markov chain approach has shown that the joint exploitation of one source will give more benefit to the group than an even distribution of effort over two different sources. In humans, evidence suggests that conformity is the product of both informational and normative influences, where the latter refers to receptivity to intra-group social pressures. Social scientists have regarded this as an important evolutionary instinct which encourages socially constructive empathy and altruism, helpful in overcoming conflict. The advantages conferred to herd behavior has led to it shaping human evolution, consistent with Darwin’s theory of natural selection.

=== Neuroscience ===
Herd behavior can also be illuminated by neuroscience. Recent developments in neuroscience suggest that our tendency to ‘imitate’ might be due to a system of ‘mirror neurons’ in our brains. In an experiment that recorded electrical activity in the brain of a macaque, it was found that the same neurons fired both when the monkey acted and when the monkey observed the same action performed by the other. The neuron ‘mirrored’ the motor behavior of the other, as though the observer was executing the motor act. It is hypothesized that there is a similar ‘mirror neuron’ network that exists in human brains but has yet to be proven because of the ethical considerations surrounding experimentation.

Another neuroscientific phenomenon which results in the primitive, automatic and unconscious process of social mimicry is emotional contagion. When a receiver of information interacts with its sender, the receiver perceives the emotional expressions of the sender and automatically transfers the emotional expressions to his/her bodily expressions. Through the process of afferent feedback, the copied bodily expressions result in the receiver experiencing the same emotions as the sender. This leads to an emotional convergence and mimicry behavior. This theory is reinforced by a study that has shown that herd-decisions are associated with shorter decision-making times, suggesting that herding is an intrinsic, emotional response and a more automatic decision-making heuristic.

Neuroscientific analysis of economic games suggests that social rewards trigger a ‘bliss response’, through the release of the neurochemical, oxytocin. Importantly, activations are pronounced where cooperation is reciprocated. This creates a positive feedback loop, where the brain triggers social behavior to release a ‘bliss response’.

=== Psychology ===
‘Docility’, or receptivity to social norms is a fundamental characteristic that underlies herd behavior. Research done on cognitive psychology has shown that humans differ from other species in the development of social norms and mutually shared expectations which inform them about what actions are normal, appropriate or just given any situation. The Asch experiment where subjects conformed to the erroneous majority view, has shown that the human mind is built to be receptive to social norms and self-censor actions in advance to avoid deviations from the norm. ‘Docility’ is also created by the human response to narratives and stories, by which most information is conveyed, which influences people to view, interpret and see things from a shared viewpoint.

Experimental evidence has shown that there exists a correlation between risk aversion and herding behavior. People tend to avoid risk and conform to the status quo as they believe that others’ information is more reliable and strength in numbers minimizes uncertainties. For instance, consumers on online platforms perceive popular products as the ones with superior quality.

=== Sociology ===
A study by Katona established that there were two primary methods of group-learning: (1) the ‘stamping-in’ of simple rules-of-thumb and heuristics and (2) learning that occurs via problem solving and understanding. Imitating behavior of a social group to learn falls under the former as it relies on observations of others as opposed to individual experience. This provides a ‘fast and frugal heuristic approach to learning’ in social situations and a path of least resistance, which humans gravitate towards.

Additionally, in a world where social perception is an inherent determinant of social status, it seems rational to submit to majority pressure. The desire to strongly identify with the group could thus spur people to abandon their own judgements and imitate the actions of others within the group.

== In modern society ==
While in some situations, adopting the herd mentality can be a beneficial survival strategy, herd behavior has not been well-adapted for modern ‘artificial’ contexts and can lead to negative consequences.  

Trading in financial markets is characterized by herd behavior to a large extent. In times of market uncertainty, fear response drives investors to imitate what other investors are doing without conducting their own analysis to mitigate the risk of failure. Economist Keynes states that ‘worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally’. Unjustified runs on foreign exchange currencies and stock market bubbles are usually attributable to herding behavior. At other times, individuals benefit from the ‘information cascade’ by herding to piece together incomplete information about the market. Nonetheless, the arbitrary nature of decision-making in the financial markets based on herding can generate large-scale instability.

Herd mentality can be harnessed as a useful tool in marketing (i.e. influencers and reviews) as studies have found that shoppers are more inclined to purchase a product when their attitude is framed by others’ influence and that herd mentality becomes more apparent as the group size grows.

Nonetheless, herd behavior on social media can also create dangerous echo chambers and lead to the polarization of society. When people do not challenge the status quo or express dissenting opinions, it might create an echo-chamber environment where a person only encounters information that reflects and reinforces their own. Where members of a societal group adopt homogenous opinions, it amplifies the group’s collective beliefs and might result in the marginalization of minority viewpoints and a potential for group members to priorities consensus over rational decision-making (known as ‘group think’).

<doc id="1277704" wikidata="Q155954" url="?curid=1277704" title="Tenofovir disoproxil">
<text>Tenofovir disoproxil, sold under the brand name Viread among others, is a medication used to treat chronic hepatitis B and to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention of HIV/AIDS among those at high risk before exposure, and after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is sold both by itself and together in combinations such as emtricitabine/tenofovir, efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir, and elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir. It does not cure HIV/AIDS or hepatitis B. It is available by mouth as a tablet or powder.
Common side effects include nausea, rash, diarrhea, headache, pain, depression, and weakness. Severe side effects include high blood lactate and an enlarged liver. There are no absolute contraindications. It is often recommended during pregnancy and appears to be safe. It is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor and works by decreasing the ability of the viruses to replicate.
Tenofovir was patented in 1996 and approved for use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available in the United States as a generic medication as of 2017.

==Medical uses==
Tenofovir disoproxil is used for HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B treatment. For HIV-1 infection, tenofovir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for people 2 years of age and older. For chronic hepatitis B patients, tenofovir is indicated for patients 12 years of age and older.

===HIV risk reduction===
Tenofovir can be used for HIV prevention in people who are at high risk for infection through sexual transmission or injecting drug use. A Cochrane review examined the use of tenofovir for prevention of HIV before exposure and found that both tenofovir alone and the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination decreased the risk of contracting HIV for high risk patients. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also conducted a study in partnership with the Thailand Ministry of Public Health to ascertain the effectiveness of providing people who inject drugs illicitly with daily doses of tenofovir as a prevention measure. The results revealed a 48.9% reduced incidence of the virus among the group of subjects who received the drug in comparison to the control group who received a placebo.

==Adverse effects==
Tenofovir disoproxil is generally well tolerated with low discontinuation rates among the HIV and chronic hepatitis B population. There are no contraindications for use of this drug. The most commonly reported side effects due to use of tenofovir disoproxil were dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects include depression, sleep disturbances, headache, itching, rash, and fever. The US boxed warning cautions potential onset of lactic acidosis or liver damage due to use of tenofovir disoproxil.

Long term use of tenofovir disoproxil is associated with nephrotoxicity and bone loss. Presentation of nephrotoxicity can appear as Fanconi syndrome, acute kidney injury, or decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil can potentially lead to reversal of renal impairment. Nephrotoxicity may be due to proximal tubules accumulation of Tenofovir disoproxil leading to elevated serum concentrations.

== Interactions ==

Tenofovir interacts with didanosine and HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Tenofovir increases didanosine concentrations and can result in adverse effects such as pancreatitis and neuropathy. Tenofovir also interacts with HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, by decreasing atazanavir concentrations while increasing tenofovir concentrations. In addition, since tenofovir is excreted by the kidney, medications that impair renal function can also cause problems.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Tenofovir disoproxil is a nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). It selectively inhibits viral reverse transcriptase, a crucial enzyme in retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), while showing limited inhibition of human enzymes, such as DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. In vivo tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is converted to tenofovir, an acyclic analog of deoxyadenosine 5&#x27;-monophosphate (dAMP).
Tenofovir lacks a hydroxyl group in the position corresponding to the 3&#x27; carbon of the dAMP, preventing the formation of the 5′ to 3′ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation. Once incorporated into a growing DNA strand, tenofovir causes premature termination of DNA transcription, preventing viral replication.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Tenofovir disoproxil is a prodrug that is quickly absorbed from the gut and cleaved to release tenofovir. Inside cells, tenofovir is phosphorylated to tenofovir diphosphate (which is analogous to a &quot;tri&quot;phosphate, as tenofovir itself already has one phosphonate residue), the active compound that inhibits reverse transcriptase via chain termination.

In fasting persons, bioavailability is 25%, and highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after one hour. When taken with fatty food, highest plasma concentrations are reached after two hours, and the area under the curve is increased by 40%. It is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2.

Tenofovir is mainly excreted via the kidneys, both by glomerular filtration and by tubular secretion using the transport proteins OAT1, OAT3 and ABCC4.

===Detection in body fluids===
Tenofovir may be measured in plasma by liquid chromatography. Such testing is useful for monitoring therapy and to prevent drug accumulation and toxicity in people with kidney or liver problems.

== Chemistry ==
Tenofovir is a derivative of adenine and this was the chemical starting point for its first published synthesis which was included in patents to the compound. During drug development, attention switched to the phosphonate ester derivative, tenofovir disoproxil, which was the subject of extensive process chemistry to provide a viable manufacturing route.
Adenine is first reacted with a chiral version of propylene carbonate with &quot;R&quot; absolute configuration, using sodium hydroxide as base. Under these conditions, the reaction is regioselective, with alkylation occurring exclusively in the imidazole ring and at the less-hindered carbon of the dioxolane. In the second step, the hydroxyl group is reacted with a phosphonic acid derivative, using &quot;tert&quot;-butyllithium as base to ensure selective O-alkylation, with the formation of an ether bond. Tenofovir is formed when the diethyl phosphonate group is converted to its acid using trimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of sodium bromide, a further refinement of the original manufacturing route. The synthesis of the alternative ester in tenofovir disoproxil is completed by alkylation with the appropriate chloromethyl ether derivative and this may be purified as its fumarate salt.

==History==
Tenofovir was initially synthesized by Antonín Holý at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in Prague. The patent filed in 1986 makes no mention of the potential use of the compound for the treatment of HIV infection but claims activity against herpes simplex virus.

In 1985, De Clercq and Holý described the activity of PMPA against HIV in cell culture. Shortly thereafter, a collaboration with the biotechnology company Gilead Sciences led to the investigation of PMPA&#x27;s potential as a treatment for HIV infected patients. In 1997 researchers from Gilead and the University of California, San Francisco demonstrated that tenofovir exhibits anti-HIV effects in humans when dosed by subcutaneous injection.

The initial form of tenofovir used in these studies had limited potential for widespread use because it poorly penetrated cells and was not absorbed when given by mouth. Gilead developed a pro-drug version of tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil. This version of tenofovir is often referred to simply as &quot;tenofovir&quot;. In this version of the drug, the two negative charges of the tenofovir phosphonic acid group are masked, thus enhancing oral absorption.

Tenofovir disoproxil was approved in the U.S. in 2001, for the treatment of HIV, and in 2008, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.

==Drug forms==
Tenofovir disoproxil can be taken by mouth and is sold under the brand name Viread, among others. Tenofovir disoproxil is a pro-drug form of tenofovir phosphonate, which is liberated intracellularly and converted to tenofovir disphophate. It is marketed by Gilead Sciences (as the fumarate, abbreviated TDF).

Tenofovir disoproxil is also available in pills which combine a number of antiviral drugs into a single dose. Well-known combinations include Atripla (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/efavirenz), Complera (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/rilpivirine), Stribild (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat), and Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine).

Gilead has created a second pro-drug form of the active drug, tenofovir diphosphate, called tenofovir alafenamide. It differs from tenofovir disoproxil due to its activation in the lymphoid cells. This allows the active metabolites to accumulate in those cells, leading to lower systemic exposure and potential toxicities.

<text>George Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Nugent of Carlanstown, GCMG (31 December 1788 – 26 November 1850), was an Irish politician.

==Life==
A younger son of George Nugent-Temple, 1st Marquess of Buckingham, by Lady Mary Elizabeth Nugent, only daughter and heiress of Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent, he was born on 31 December 1788. His mother was created a baroness of the kingdom of Ireland in 1800, with remainder to her second son; and on her death (16 March 1813) he consequently succeeded to the peerage. Nugent was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, and in 1810 received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from the university.

He was Whig Member of Parliament for Buckingham, 1810–1812. This was a rotten borough controlled by the Grenvilles. At the general election of 1812 Nugent was returned to Parliament for the borough of Aylesbury; but in 1818 he was in some danger of losing his seat in consequence of his brother Richard, then by courtesy the Marquess of Buckingham, having joined the ministry. Nugent stood in his own interest, however, and was returned. He fought another successful contest in 1831, and remained one of the members for Aylesbury until the dissolution in 1832.

In November 1830 Nugent was made one of the Lords of the Treasury, but he resigned this position in August 1832, to become Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. This office he retained for three years, returning to England with the Grand Cross of St. Michael and St. George. He again offered himself for Aylesbury in 1837 and 1839, but was defeated on both occasions; and in 1843, when he stood, with the reformer George Thompson, for Southampton, he sustained a third defeat. On reappearing at Aylesbury in 1847 he was returned.

Nugent was an extreme Whig, or a whig-radical, in politics. He was a strong supporter of Queen Caroline of Brunswick, and he visited Spain as a partisan of the Spanish Liberals against the Carlists. In the session of 1848 Nugent moved for leave to bring in a bill abolishing the separate imprisonment in gaols of persons committed for trial, but the motion was lost. During the same session he advocated the abolition of capital punishment. In 1849 he voted for limiting the powers of the Habeas Corpus (Ireland) Suspension Bill, and also supported a measure for the further repeal of Penal Laws. 
He was a member of the Reform Club and the Athenaeum Club.

Nugent died on 26 November 1850, at his residence in Buckinghamshire.

==Works==
In 1812 Nugent published &quot;Portugal, a Poem&quot; then in 1829 &quot;Oxford and Locke&quot;, which defended the expulsion of Locke from the University of Oxford against the censures of Dugald Stewart. Nugent&#x27;s sympathetic &quot;Memorials of John Hampden&quot; appeared in 1832. The work was favourably reviewed by Thomas Babington Macaulay in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, and adversely by Robert Southey in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, resulting in a flurry of correspondence.

&quot;Legends of the Library at Lillies&quot; (his family seat) appeared in 1832: &quot;from the fireside of the... little oak library the following legends proceed.&quot; It was followed by the two-volume travelogue &quot;Lands Classical and Sacred&quot; in 18456. Nugent also wrote pamphlets on political, social, and ecclesiastical subjects.

==Family==

Nugent married, 6 September 1813, Anne Lucy, second daughter of Major-General the Hon. Vere Poulett. She died without issue in 1848, and the barony became extinct on the death of Nugent.

<doc id="1277707" wikidata="Q346490" url="?curid=1277707" title="Thomas Burnett Swann">
<text>Thomas Burnett Swann (October 12, 1928 – May 5, 1976) was an American poet, critic and fantasy author. His criticism includes works on the poetry of H.D. and Christina Rossetti. Swann died of cancer and several of his novels were published posthumously.

==Poetry==
Swann&#x27;s poetry consists largely of short, whimsical pieces evoking a naive innocence. Many of them were later incorporated into his novels and placed in the mouths of his characters – sometimes the same poem is spoken by two or three different characters in novels set centuries and continents apart.

Poets also frequently appear as characters in his novels, always on the side of good: Sappho in &quot;Wolfwinter&quot; (1972); Robert Herrick in &quot;Will-o-the-Wisp&quot; (1977, serialized 1974); a fictionalized Charles Sorley in &quot;The Goat Without Horns&quot; (1971); and Thomas Chatterton in &quot;The Not-World&quot; (1975).

==Fiction==

===Science fiction===
Swann began writing fiction in 1958 with &quot;Winged Victory&quot;, a science fiction story based on the famous headless statue known as the Winged Victory of Samothrace. In Swann&#x27;s story the statue&#x27;s head is discovered and found to have been modeled upon an alien visitor whom the sculptor took for a goddess.

Extraterrestrials also feature in &quot;The Painter&quot;, in which the painter Hieronymous Bosch is abducted by hideous aliens and forced to paint them, thereby providing the inspiration for the grotesque images in his painting &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;. This and many other early stories appeared in the British magazine &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;. Some stories also appeared in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction (F&amp;SF)&quot;.

===Fantasy===
Most of Swann&#x27;s fiction was outright fantasy. The early story &quot;The Dryad-tree&quot; is set in contemporary Florida and features a woman&#x27;s reaction to the knowledge that her new husband&#x27;s garden contains a tree possessed by a jealous dryad. The story was adapted as a short film in 2017.

The bulk of Swann&#x27;s fantasy fits into a rough chronology that begins in ancient Egypt around 2500 BC and chronicles the steady decline of magic and mythological races such as dryads, centaurs, satyrs, selkies and minotaurs. The coming of more &quot;advanced&quot; civilisations constantly threatens to destroy their pre-industrial world, and they must continually seek refuge wherever they can. They see the advent of Christianity as a major tragedy; the Christians regard magic and mythological beings as evil and seek to destroy the surviving creatures, although some manage to survive and preserve some of their old ways through medieval times down to the late 19th century and perhaps even the 20th.

===Sexuality as a topic===
An undercurrent of sexuality runs through all of these stories. Many of Swann&#x27;s characters are sexually adventurous and regard sexual repression as spiritually damaging. Casual and sometimes permanent nudity is common. Homosexual relationships between both male and female characters are often hinted at, although seldom made explicit.

The most openly homosexual relationship in Swann&#x27;s stories is also the most controversial. His novel &quot;How Are the Mighty Fallen&quot; (1974) depicts the Biblical Jonathan and David as lovers, and furthermore suggests that Jonathan was himself a member of an ancient winged half-human race. The book appeared from Swann&#x27;s regular publisher DAW Books, but only after DAW&#x27;s founder and chief executive Donald A. Wollheim fought to prevent distributor New American Library from banning it. However, Swann was reportedly unhappy with George Barr&#x27;s cover artwork, which showed two of the characters being chased by a cyclops, because he felt it misrepresented the style of the novel.

==Works (excluding non-fiction and poetry)==

===The Minotaur Trilogy===
(Written in reverse order. Swann claimed that he would correct the inconsistencies between the two earlier books if there was a second edition, but in the event there was not.)
*&quot;Cry Silver Bells&quot; (1977)
*&quot;The Forest of Forever&quot; (1971)
*&quot;The Day of the Minotaur&quot; (1966; previously serialized in 1964-1965 as &quot;The Blue Monkeys&quot; in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;)
The three novels were collected as &quot;The Minotaur Trilogy&quot; (1997)

===The Latium Trilogy===
(Not Swann&#x27;s title; also written largely in reverse)
*&quot;Queens Walk in the Dusk&quot; (1977)
**Formerly Swann&#x27;s rarest novel, only published in a limited edition of 2000 copies. It has since been reprinted in both hardcover and paperback editions.
*&quot;Green Phoenix: The Last Stand of the Prehumans&quot; (1972; based on the novella &quot;Love Is A Dragonfly&quot; published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; March 1972)
*&quot;Lady of the Bees&quot; (1976; expanded from the 1962 &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; story &quot;Where is the Bird of Fire?&quot;)

===Others===
*&quot;The Weirwoods&quot; (1967; serialized in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; 1965)
*&quot;Moondust&quot; (1968)
*&quot;The Goat Without Horns&quot; (1971)
*&quot;Wolfwinter&quot; (1972)
*&quot;How Are the Mighty Fallen&quot; (1974)
*&quot;Will-o-the-Wisp&quot; (1976; serialized in &quot;Fantastic&quot; in 1974); the book seems to have been typeset directly from the magazine, resulting in part of the synopsis of part 1 being erroneously included in the book. The cover design, depicting a woman riding a giant insect, also seems to have been inspired by the cover of the magazine issue containing part 1, although this actually had no connection with Swann&#x27;s story.
*&quot;The Not-World&quot; (1975)
*&quot;The Gods Abide&quot; (1976)
*&quot;The Tournament of Thorns&quot; (1976, assembled from two stories in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;; &quot;The Manor Of Roses&quot; [1966] and &quot;The Stalking Trees&quot; [January 1973])
*&quot;The Minikins of Yam&quot; (1976). This novel&#x27;s prologue is printed before the title page, opposite the inside front cover where promotional text would normally be placed.

===Short story collections===
*&quot;The Dolphin and the Deep&quot; (1968)
*&quot;Where is the Bird of Fire?&quot; (1970)

<text>Sophie Antonie Luise Schröder ( Bürger; 1 March 1781 – 25 February 1868) was a German actress and an early adopter of spoken word performances combined with music.

Born at Paderborn, the daughter of an actor, Gottfried Bürger, she made her first appearance in opera at St Petersburg, in 1793. On Kotzebue&#x27;s recommendation she was engaged for the Vienna Court theatre in 1798, and here and in Munich and Hamburg she won great successes in tragic roles like Marie Stuart, Phèdre, Merope, Lady Macbeth, and Isabella in &quot;The Bride of Messina&quot;, which gave her the reputation of being &quot;the German Siddons.&quot; 

She retired in 1840 and lived in Augsburg and Munich until her death in 1868. She had married, in 1795, an actor, Stollmers (properly Smets), from whom she separated in 1799. In 1804, she married the tenor Friedrich Schröder, and after his death in 1818, she married the actor, Wilhelm Kunst in 1825. Schröder&#x27;s eldest daughter was the opera singer, Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient. She had several illegitimate children with the painter Moritz Michael Daffinger.

She has worked with many popular artists; sales of albums on which her songs appear exceed 160 million worldwide. DioGuardi is a 2011 NAMM Music for Life Award winner, 2009 NMPA Songwriter Icon Award winner, 2007 BMI Pop Songwriter of the Year, and has received 20 BMI Awards for co-writing songs.

DioGuardi was a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot; for its eighth and ninth seasons. In 2008, she was appointed to the position of executive vice president of talent development at Warner Bros. Records; she has signed acts such as Jason Derulo and Iyaz. In 2011, she was a head judge on the Bravo singer-songwriter competition series &quot;Platinum Hit&quot;.

== Early life ==
DioGuardi was born in Ossining, New York. Her father is former Republican Congressman and 2010 US Senate candidate Joe DioGuardi; her grandfather was Albanian. Her mother Carol died in 1997 after a seven-year battle with ovarian cancer.

DioGuardi grew up in the Wilmot Woods section of suburban New Rochelle, New York and attended elementary school at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic School in Scarsdale, New York. She graduated from The Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, New York and earned a degree in political science at Duke University. After graduating from college, she worked for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as an assistant to Timothy White and Howard Lander; later she was an advertising sales representative there.

== Career ==
=== Professional songwriting ===
DioGuardi has a songwriting catalog of several hundred songs; over 300 have been released on major labels worldwide and over 150 have appeared on platinum selling albums. She has had 50 international charting singles over the course of her career, and her songs have helped propel more than 66 albums into the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. Her songs have been featured in major motion pictures, television shows, film soundtracks, and radio spots, as well as in national and international commercial campaigns.

She wrote with Ashlee Simpson for Simpson&#x27;s first and second albums, in 2003 and 2004. She collaborated with Thalía in 2003 for her self-titled album &quot;Thalía&quot;. In 2004, DioGuardi co-wrote one-sixth of the tracks off Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s sophomore album &quot;Breakaway&quot; including Clarkson&#x27;s hit &quot;Walk Away&quot;. DioGuardi then worked with Australian singer, Ricki-Lee Coulter on her 2005 single, Sunshine from her debut studio album, &quot;Ricki-Lee&quot;, which was released in October of the same year. 

She also worked with Christina Aguilera on her album &quot;Back to Basics&quot; in 2006, co-writing twelve of the thirteen tracks on disc one of the album, among them being &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Other Man&quot; and &quot;Back in the Day&quot;.

In 2007, DioGuardi worked with many notable artists, one of whom was Britney Spears. DioGuardi wrote and produced &quot;Ooh Ooh Baby&quot; and co-produced &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; on Spears&#x27; album &quot;Blackout&quot;. DioGuardi also contributed a majority of the songs on Hilary Duff&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Dignity&quot;. Since &quot;American Idol&quot; Season 8, DioGuardi returned to songwriting and producing, and has worked with number of artists, including Pink&#x27;s &quot;Sober,&quot; Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;I Do Not Hook Up,&quot; Cobra Starship&#x27;s &quot;Good Girls Go Bad,&quot; Katharine McPhee&#x27;s &quot;Had It All&quot;, Carrie Underwood&#x27;s &quot;Undo It&quot;, and Theory of a Deadman&#x27;s &quot;Not Meant to Be&quot; among other releases.

Among DioGuardi&#x27;s projects is the song &quot;Not Meant to Be&quot;, which appears on Theory of a Deadman&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;Scars &amp; Souvenirs&quot;. She co-wrote the song with lead singer Tyler Connolly, and is also featured as the love interest in the music video which was released on March 10, 2009. The song was her debut in the music video industry.

In 2007, Dioguardi and Eurythmics member Dave Stewart wrote &quot;Taking Chances&quot; for Celine Dion.
It was released as the first single from the album &quot;Taking Chances&quot; in September 2007.
The song was a success around the world reaching the top ten in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy and Switzerland. It also peaked at number 40 on the UK Singles Chart, while reaching number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

In 2009, DioGuardi wrote &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot; for Meat Loaf&#x27;s 2010 album, &quot;Hang Cool Teddy Bear&quot; and recorded the vocal as a duet with him. She is also one of the writers for &quot;Ghost&quot;, which was released as a single from Fefe Dobson&#x27;s album &quot;Joy&quot; (2010). She wrote songs for Aussie singer Natalie Imbruglia&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Counting Down the Days&quot;. After taking a break from writing DioGuardi was one of the songwriters of Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat Song&quot; which was the first single from Clarkson&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; (2015). DioGuardi wrote &quot;Rebel Hearts&quot; for Hilary Duff&#x27;s &quot;Breathe In Breathe Out&quot; album in 2015.

=== Songs for film and television ===
DioGuardi has also written for films and television series. She wrote &quot;Halo&quot; for One Tree Hill, &quot;Brand New Day&quot; for &quot;Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam&quot;, &quot;We Rock&quot; and &quot;Play My Music&quot; for &quot;Camp Rock&quot;, &quot;He Could Be the One&quot; for &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, &quot;Set This Party Off&quot; for &quot;Jonas,&quot; and &quot;Someone Watching over Me&quot; for &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot;. She has written songs which have been used as themes including &quot;Taking Chances&quot; on &quot;Glee&quot;, &quot;Come Clean&quot; on &quot;Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County&quot;, &quot;Autobiography&quot; on &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show,&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Other Man&quot; on &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel&quot;.

=== Music publishing ===
DioGuardi co-owns Arthouse Entertainment, a publishing company which is a resource business for record companies and other music entities seeking compositions, productions, artists, and related music services. Arthouse has been a part of many chart-topping hits including B.O.B&#x27;s &quot;Nothin&#x27; On You&quot;; Bruno Mars&#x27; &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; and &quot;Grenade&quot;; Cee-Lo Green&#x27;s &quot;Forget You&quot;, Flo Rida&#x27;s &quot;Club Can&#x27;t Handle Me&quot;, Demi Lovato&#x27;s &quot;Heart Attack&quot;; Jason DeRulo&#x27;s &quot;Want to Want Me&quot; and &quot;Trumpets&quot;; Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Monster&quot;, Zedd&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Now&quot;, Jon Bellion&#x27;s &quot;All Time Low&quot;, Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;Memories&quot;, Illenium&#x27;s &quot;Good Things Fall Apart&quot;, Halsey&#x27;s &quot;Graveyard&quot;, Florida Georgia Line&#x27;s &quot;Simple&quot;, and Ingrid Andress&#x27; &quot;More Hearts Than Mine.&quot;

=== Reality television ===
In July 2006, DioGuardi was a judge in an &quot;Idol&quot;-like TV show called &quot;The One: Making a Music Star&quot;. The show debuted on ABC with the second-lowest rating ever for a premiere on a major American network and was abruptly canceled after just two weeks.

In 2009, she joined the hit Fox television show &quot;American Idol&quot; as a fourth judge for the show&#x27;s eighth season alongside judges Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, and Paula Abdul. DioGuardi returned to &quot;Idol&quot; for its ninth season alongside Cowell, Jackson, and new judge Ellen DeGeneres who replaced Paula Abdul after she quit the show in contract disagreements. However, DioGuardi decided to leave the show on September 3, 2010 and did not return for the tenth season of &quot;Idol&quot;. It has since been said that DioGuardi helped Steven Tyler become a judge on American Idol, after they worked together at DioGuardi&#x27;s house in Los Angeles. She has had &quot;Idol&quot; connections in the past: in 2000, DioGuardi and former &quot;Idol&quot; judge Paula Abdul co-wrote the UK number-one single &quot;Spinning Around&quot;, performed by Kylie Minogue. DioGuardi has written many songs sung by Idol winners and alumni such as Kelly Clarkson, Allison Iraheta, David Archuleta, Carrie Underwood, Diana DeGarmo, Katharine McPhee, Kris Allen, Danny Gokey, and Adam Lambert. DioGuardi co-wrote the &quot;American Idol&quot; season eight coronation single, &quot;No Boundaries&quot;, which was performed by both finalists during the competition. DioGuardi struggled to find her place among the judges. In Richard Rushfield&#x27;s book, &quot;American Idol: The Untold Story,&quot; he reveals that often the other judges would leave the studio during commercial breaks, leaving DioGuardi behind to awkwardly sit by herself.

DioGuardi also co-wrote with Jason Reeves a song called &quot;Terrified&quot; for Katharine McPhee&#x27;s album &quot;Unbroken&quot;, which was covered by Didi Benami, an &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant from Season 9, during Hollywood week. DioGuardi recorded a video of herself singing &quot;Terrified&quot; with Jason Reeves on YouTube, which has over 1,800,000 views. She appeared on &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; as herself in the episode &quot;Judge Me Tender&quot;.

After leaving &quot;American Idol&quot;, she was a head judge on the Bravo singer-songwriter competition series &quot;Platinum Hit&quot;.

=== Other projects ===
DioGuardi guest starred as herself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. From September 5 – October 30, 2011, she made her Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in &quot;Chicago&quot;. She released an autobiography after her departure from &quot;American Idol&quot; named &quot;A Helluva High Note; Surviving Life, Love and American Idol&quot;.

Since 2012, she has taught a semester course called &quot;Hitmaking with Kara DioGuardi&quot; at Berklee College of Music in Boston. The course was developed specifically for the fall 2012 curriculum; it has paired 27 student songwriters and producers to mirror today&#x27;s music industry practices. One of her students was Charlie Puth.

In late 2017, DioGuardi helped launch the first effort in Maine of a national program working to prevent child sexual abuse, the Enough Abuse Campaign (EAC).

=== Awards and nominations ===
In 2003, DioGuardi won a BMI Cable Award for co-writing and performing &quot;Somethin&#x27; To Say&quot;, the theme to the Lifetime Television series &quot;For the People&quot;, which starred Lea Thompson, Debbi Morgan, A. Martinez, and Cecilia Suárez. DioGuardi has been awarded 15 BMI Awards for having co-written the most performed songs on the radio. One of the industry&#x27;s most highly sought after songwriters and producers, her songs have appeared on records which have sold more than 150 million copies combined. In 2007, she was nominated for a Latin Grammy in the category of Song of the Year for writing the Belinda single, &quot;Bella Traición&quot; along with co-writers Belinda, Ben Moody, Nacho Peregrin and producer Mitch Allan. In November 2007, DioGuardi was awarded the TAXI A&amp;R award for Humanitarian of the Year at the annual Road Rally Convention.

== Personal life ==
DioGuardi splits her time between Los Angeles and York Harbor, Maine. She began dating teacher-turned-general contractor Mike McCuddy in 2007 after the two met while he was working on a home adjacent to her property in Maine. After a year and a half of dating, DioGuardi and McCuddy got engaged in December 2008 and married on July 5, 2009, in Prospect Harbor, Maine. McCuddy has a teenage daughter from a previous relationship. Together, DioGuardi and McCuddy have one son, born via gestational carrier on January 31, 2013. The couple made the decision to use a surrogate after years of infertility and unsuccessful in vitro fertilization attempts.

DioGuardi works with the Phoenix House, a non-profit substance abuse service organization; she contributes to recording studios in the facilities and helps teach the teens how to operate the equipment. In February 2010, she joined former &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant Elliott Yamin in a charity trip sponsored by ExxonMobil to Angola where they visited malaria prevention and treatment projects as part of Idol Gives Back.

In May 2010, she posed nude for the annual &quot;Naked Truth&quot; issue of &quot;Allure&quot; magazine.

<doc id="1277721" wikidata="Q1702401" url="?curid=1277721" title="Johnny Rodriguez">
<text>Juan Raoul Davis &quot;Johnny&quot; Rodriguez (born December 10, 1951) is an American country music singer. He is a Tejano and Texas country music singer, infusing his music with Latin sounds, and even singing verses of songs in Spanish.

In the 1970s and 1980s, he was one of country music&#x27;s most successful male artists, recording a string of hit songs, such as &quot;You Always Come Back to Hurting Me,&quot; &quot;Desperado,&quot; &quot;Down on the Rio Grande&quot; and &quot;Foolin&#x27;.&quot; He has recorded six No. 1 country hits in his career.

==Early life==
Rodriguez was born in Sabinal, Texas, situated 90 miles from Mexico. He was the second youngest in a family of 10 children living in a four-room house. Growing up in Sabinal, Rodriguez was a good student in school and an altar boy for his church. He was also the captain of his junior high school football team. When Rodriguez was 16 years old, his father died of cancer, and his older brother, Andres, died in an automobile accident the following year. The two incidents had an effect on Rodriguez and he became a troubled teen.

In 1969, at age 18, Rodriguez ended up in jail. He sang frequently in his cell and was overheard by Texas Ranger Joaquin Jackson, who was impressed and told promoter &quot;Happy&quot; Shahan about him. (The common story told is that he was arrested after he and some friends were caught stealing and barbecuing a goat, although Jackson would later state that Rodriguez was in jail simply for an unpaid fine.)

Shahan then hired Johnny to perform at his local tourist attraction called the Alamo Village. During one of his sets in 1971, he came to the attention of country singers Tom T. Hall and Bobby Bare, who encouraged the young singer to go to Nashville, Tennessee. The 21-year-old singer arrived in Nashville with only a guitar in his hand and $14 in his pocket. Hall soon found work for Rodriguez fronting his band, as well as writing songs.

Less than one year later, Hall took Rodriguez to Mercury Records&#x27; Nashville division and landed him an audition with the record label. After performing the songs &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; and &quot;If I Left It Up to You,&quot; he was offered a contract with Mercury. He signed and began recording in their Nashville studio.

==Career==
===Career in the 1970s===
After signing with Mercury, his first single to be released was 1972&#x27;s &quot;Pass Me By (If You&#x27;re Only Passing Through).&quot; This recording was a success, going to No. 9 on the Hot Country Songs list that year. Rodriguez became the first well-known American of Mexican descent as a country singer.

In 1972, Rodriguez was voted the &#x27;Most Promising Vocalist&#x27; by the Academy of Country Music. The next year, he achieved his first No. 1 hit song, &quot;You Always Come Back to Hurting Me.&quot; Another song that year, &quot;Ridin&#x27; My Thumb to Mexico,&quot; written by Rodriguez, was also a No. 1 hit. Both songs were listed in the Billboard Hot 100.

In 1973, his debut album was released, which rose to No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart. He was nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year by the CMA Awards. In addition to his success in country music, he also had a role on the television show &quot;Adam-12&quot; and also made a guest appearance on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; in 1974.

In 1975, all three singles he released reached to No. 1 on the country chart: &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Get Her Out of My Mind&quot; &quot;Just Get Up and Close the Door,&quot; and &quot;Love Put a Song in My Heart.&quot; Rodriguez&#x27;s success on the country chart continued throughout much of the 1970s. He recorded songs not only written by himself around this time, but also covers of songs such as George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Something,&quot; Linda Hargrove&#x27;s &quot;Just Get Up and Close the Door,&quot; Mickey Newbury&#x27;s &quot;Poison Red Berries,&quot; and Billy Joe Shaver&#x27;s &quot;Texas Up Here Tennessee.&quot; By 1975, Rodriguez was considered a member of the outlaw country market in country music, like fellow musicians Bobby Bare and Tom T. Hall.

===Career in the 1980s and 1990s and murder charge===
Despite the outlaw movement fading from view in the late 1970s, Rodriguez was determined to stay on top of his game. In 1979, he switched to Epic Records. There he worked with the record producer Billy Sherrill. His first hit from Epic came that year with the No. 6 country hit, &quot;Down on the Rio Grande.&quot; His debut album from the record company was entitled &quot;Rodriguez&quot;, although all the songs from the album were cover versions.

Although Rodriguez did not make the Top 10 continuously as in the past, he managed to stay in the Top 20, with hits like &quot;Fools For Each Other&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;ll I Tell Virginia.&quot; At the same time, Rodriguez continued to be a popular concert attraction. However, Rodriguez was also having personal problems, due to his drug addiction. In 1982, he did a duet with Zella Lehr on the song &quot;Most Beautiful Girl (La Chica Mas Linda).&quot; The single was released by Columbia Records. In 1983, he went into the Top 5 with the hit song &quot;Foolin&#x27;,&quot; followed by the Top 10 hit &quot;How Could I Love Her So Much.&quot; However, by the mid-1980s, he was becoming less successful and, in 1986, he left Epic Records.

In 1987, he signed with Capitol Records for a brief period of time. He had his last major hit in 1988 with &quot;I Didn&#x27;t (Every Chance I Had),&quot; which reached No. 12 on the country chart. By 1989, he had left Capitol.

In August 1998, Rodriguez shot and killed a 28-year-old acquaintance in his Texas home, believing the man to be a burglar. In October 1999, he was acquitted of murder by a jury.

In 1993, he recorded an album for Intersound Records called &quot;Run For the Border.&quot; In the mid-1990s, the indie label High-Tone released his album, &quot;You Can Say That Again&quot;. He continued to tour around the country during this time. In 1996, he turned to another label, Paula Records, which issued &quot;One Bar At a Time&quot;, but it was unsuccessful. By this time his musical presence was fading from the public view.

===1998–present===
Since 1998, Rodriguez has toured the United States and further afield including Switzerland, Poland, UK, South Korea, Canada, and Mexico. He has performed concerts at the Ryman Auditorium and Carnegie Hall.

Rodriguez continues to tour and record new material, performing dates in the United States and Canada. In 2012, he released his first live album, &quot;Johnny Rodriguez: Live from Texas&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Rodriguez has been honored by three U.S. presidents: Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. He played at George H.W. Bush&#x27;s inaugural ball.

On August 18, 2007, Rodriguez was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, located in Carthage, Texas.

On October 23, 2010, Rodriguez received the Institute of Hispanic Culture Pioneer Award, in recognition of his accomplishment as the first major Hispanic singer in country music.

==Personal life==
Rodriguez was first married to Linda Diann Patterson, a Southern Airways flight attendant from Conyers, Georgia. His second marriage was in 1995 to Lana Nelson, daughter of country singer/songwriter Willie Nelson. That marriage lasted seven months. His most recent marriage was to Debbie McNeely, a hair salon owner from San Marcos, Texas, in 1998, with whom he had a daughter, Aubry Rae Rodriguez born in April 1998.

<doc id="1277725" wikidata="Q64854" url="?curid=1277725" title="Herta Ehlert">
<text>Herta Ehlert (née Liess; 26 March 1905 – 4 April 1997) was a female guard at many Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.

== During the war ==
Ehlert was working as a bakery assistant until she was called for &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) work by the Labor Exchange on 15 November 1939. She maintained that she was a conscript when she began working as a &quot;novice&quot; at Ravensbrück concentration camp. She stated, &quot;I had to see that civilian workers did not mix with the prisoners, and later on, I was detailed to working parties outside camp.&quot;

In October 1942, she was moved as an &quot;Aufseherin&quot; to the Majdanek camp near Lublin, Poland. She claimed she was moved as a punishment for being too nice to the prisoners, by not giving them harsh enough punishments and helping to feed them. However, according to the Belsen Trial, she had received a bonus, as well as better working conditions at this camp.

By mid-1944, she was transferred to Kraków. SS officers there noticed she was too lenient, polite and helpful to the prisoners, so the SS returned her to Ravensbrück to undergo another training course, this time by Dorothea Binz. During this time, Ehlert divorced her husband. 

Ehlert was later moved to the Auschwitz concentration camp as an &quot;Aufseherin&quot;, where she oversaw women commanding &quot;Kommando&quot;s (slave labor groups). Ehlert later served as a guard at the Auschwitz subcamp in Rajsko, Poland, before she was transferred to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she became deputy wardress under &quot;Oberaufseherinnen&quot; Elisabeth Volkenrath and Irma Grese.

Halina Nelken described Ehlert at Plaszow in these words: &quot;immensely obese, sly, vicious in character, and an absolute master in using the whip. She was the overseer in charge of the kitchen. Through a small window, she would spy on the Jewish women while they were at work peeling potatoes or onions, washing dishes, and doing other chores necessary in the kitchen. Once, Ehlert even ordered the women who were at work to undress completely. After they had stripped, Ehlert searched each one extremely thoroughly, looking, no doubt, for rings, money, wrist watches, and other valuables. She remained at her job until the final liquidation of the Plaszów camp. She, too, was on the death march when the time came for us to retreat along with Germans.&quot;

== Trials ==
When the British Army liberated the Belsen camp, Ehlert was arrested and tried at the Belsen Trial. She was defendant #8 during the trial. While on trial, Ehlert was asked if she had committed theft, witnessed severe beatings, had committed murder and so on, to which she had denied most accusations. Ehlert was remanded along with all 45 defendants, and pleaded not guilty to all charges. She was found guilty at Belsen and innocent at Oświęcim. Ehlert was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Her sentence was reduced 12 years, and Ehlert was released early on 7 May 1953.

== After the war ==
After the war, she remarried and lived under the name Herta Naumann. She died in April 1997, aged 92.

<text>Nachtfalter (Moths) op. 157 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II written in 1854. The waltz was first performed at a parish festival ball at Unger&#x27;s Casino in the suburb of Hernals, Vienna on 28 August of the same year.

The work, which first suggests the whirring of the wings of a moth in the Introduction and then its circling flight, failed to gain the recognition many now feel it deserves when first performed in 1854. The Habsburg monarchy has formed an alliance with France and Great Britain during the Crimean War and the action has incurred the wrath of the Russian Tsar. Vienna at that time was also recovering from a devastating cholera outbreak that autumn and many entertainment establishments were finding it difficult to attract patronage to their dance halls and Strauss&#x27; works during that time do not reach a wider public attention.

Strauss&#x27; work eventually enticed Liszt, who was made aware of the work&#x27;s charms. The latter was observed at a festive occasion to earnestly entreating his daughter Cosima Wagner to play &#x27;Nachtfalter&#x27; with his as a piano duet. Further, performances abroad such as in Pavlovsk and the later in Paris, confirmed the work as one of Strauss&#x27; earlier inspired creations.

<text>The Record is the only daily (Monday–Friday) English language newspaper based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. It serves the Eastern Townships region of that province. It is one of the French-speaking province&#x27;s last two English-language dailies; the other is the Montreal Gazette, which serves the anglophone community in Montreal.

Launched on February 9, 1897, by businessman Leonard Channell and originally known as the &quot;Sherbrooke Daily Record&quot;, it is one of the two last surviving English-language daily newspapers in the French-speaking province, the other being the much larger &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;.

For the past several years, &quot;The Record&quot; has been a daily community newspaper for the anglophone minority in the Eastern Townships, without comprehensive coverage of national and world news.

&quot;Talk&quot;, or &quot;Talk of the Townships&quot;, a weekly television, arts and cultural insert, appears every Friday. Periodic sections focus on individual communities and events within the Record&#x27;s service area.

Future Canadian media barons John W. H. Bassett and Conrad Black both got their starts in newspaper ownership as owner and co-owner, respectively, of the &quot;Sherbrooke Daily Record&quot;.

For years &quot;The Record &quot;was owned by Black&#x27;s Hollinger International. In January 2006 it was purchased by Alta Newspaper Group, a partnership of Glacier Ventures International and former Hollinger executive David Radler.

==Fire==
In January 1999, a fire broke out in &quot;The Record&quot;″s offices, which were located on rue Delorme in Sherbrooke. The building and its contents, including the newspapers computers and presses, suffered heavy losses. The newspaper was temporarily moved to a location in nearby Lennoxville without its own press. 
A replacement press was eventually purchased and in June 2000 the newspaper moved into its current location on rue Galt Est, in Sherbrooke.

<doc id="1277737" wikidata="Q7350603" url="?curid=1277737" title="Robert Vernon, 1st Baron Lyveden">
<text>Robert Vernon, 1st Baron Lyveden (23 February 1800 – 10 November 1873), known as Robert Vernon Smith until 1859, was a British Whig and then Liberal Party politician.

==Background and education==
Vernon was the son of Robert Percy Smith, of 20 Savile Row, London, and of Cheam, Surrey, and the nephew of The Rev. Sydney Smith, Canon of St Paul&#x27;s. His mother was Carolina Maria Vernon, daughter of Richard Vernon. Vernon was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (2nd class classics 1822).

==Political career==
He was elected Member of Parliament for Tralee in 1829, a seat he held until 1831, and then sat for Northampton from 1831 to 1859. When the Whigs came to power in 1830 under Lord Grey, Vernon was appointed a Lord of the Treasury (government whip), which he remained also when Lord Melbourne became Prime Minister in July 1834. The Whigs fell from office in November of that year, but returned already in April 1835, when Vernon was appointed Secretary of the Board of Control by Melbourne, which he remained until 1839. He then served as Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1839 to 1841. The latter year he was also admitted to the Privy Council. He did not hold office again until February 1852, when he was made Secretary at War in the first administration of Lord John Russell. However, the government fell already the same month. When the Liberals (as the Whigs were now known) returned to office in 1855 under Lord Palmerston, Vernon was appointed President of the Board of Control, with a seat in the cabinet, a post he retained until the government fell in March 1858. The Indian Mutiny took place during his tenure. The following year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lyveden, of Lyveden in the County of Northampton, and in 1879 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB).

In 1845 he was appointed one of the Lay Commissioners in Lunacy.

==Family==

Lord Lyveden married Emma Mary Fitzpatrick, the illegitimate daughter of John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory, in 1823. John FitzPatrick, 1st Baron Castletown was her brother.

In 1846 he assumed for his children by Royal licence the surname of Vernon in lieu of Smith and in 1859 he assumed for himself by Royal licence the same surname in lieu of Smith. Lord Lyveden died in November 1873, aged 73, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Fitzpatrick. Lord Lyveden was a member of the Reform Club, the Travellers Club, and Brooks&#x27;s.

He tomb is located in the church of St Andrew in Brigstock, Northamptonshire.

<text>Claude Sautet (23 February 1924 – 22 July 2000) was a French film director and screenwriter.

He was a chronicler of post-war French society. He made a total of five films with his favorite actress Romy Schneider.

==Biography==
Born in Montrouge, Hauts-de-Seine, France, Sautet first studied painting and sculpture before attending a film university in Paris where he began his career and later became a television producer. His first movie, &quot;Hello Smile!&quot; (originally &quot;Bonjour Sourire&quot;) was released in 1956.

He earned international attention with &quot;The Things of Life&quot; (&quot;Les choses de la vie&quot;, 1970), which he wrote and directed, like the rest of his later films. Featuring Michel Piccoli in the male lead, it was shown in competition at the 1970 Cannes Festival. The film also revived the career of Romy Schneider; she acted in several of Sautet&#x27;s later films. In his next film &quot;Max and the Junkmen&quot; (&quot;Max et les Ferrailleurs&quot;, 1971) Schneider played a prostitute, while in &quot;César and Rosalie&quot; (&quot;César et Rosalie&quot;, 1972) she portrayed a married woman who copes with the reappearance of an old flame.

&quot;Vincent, François, Paul and the Others&quot; (&quot;Vincent, Paul, François, et les Autres&quot;, 1974) is one of Sautet&#x27;s most acclaimed films. Four middle-class men meet in the country every weekend mainly to discuss their lives. As well as Piccoli, it featured Yves Montand, Gérard Depardieu, and Stéphane Audran. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in a 2020 tribute article to Michel Piccoli thought it was &quot;arguably the best&quot; of the &quot;five very well-regarded movies&quot; on which the actor and director collaborated. Sautet achieved even further critical success with &quot;Mado&quot; (1976). 

His film &quot;A Simple Story&quot; (&quot;Une Histoire simple&quot;, 1978) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The film featured Schneider again, this time as a dissatisfied working woman in her 40s. She won the César Award for Best Actress for her performance.

In the 1980s, he made only two films &quot;Waiter!&quot; (&quot;Garçon!&quot;, 1983), a drama starring Yves Montand as a middle-aged waiter, and the comedy &quot;A Few Days with Me&quot; (&quot;Quelques Jours Avec Moi&quot;, 1988).

Claude Sautet won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and the César Award for Best Director for &quot;A Heart in Winter&quot; (&quot;Un cœur en hiver&quot;, 1992) and received the César once more for &quot;Nelly and Mr. Arnaud&quot; (&quot;Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud&quot;, 1995). Both films starred Emmanuelle Béart. Apart from his own directing, he also wrote screenplays for other directors.

Claude Sautet died of liver cancer in Paris in July 22, 2000 and was buried there in the Montparnasse Cemetery. 

In 2001, from May 5th to July 14th, Canal Plus aired eleven of its feature films in their final versions, following the work done with Béatrice Valbin.

<doc id="1277750" wikidata="Q3025242" url="?curid=1277750" title="Pimba">
<text>Pimba is an umbrella term for Portuguese types or genres of music with an uptempo style and/or folk song features, corny romantic or saucy and vulgar lyrics, which was often associated with poorly educated public from rural areas and suburban poor or working-class neighbourhoods, as well as with Portuguese economic migrants living abroad who spend their holidays in their ancestors&#x27; localities across the Portuguese countryside. The Portuguese word &quot;pimba&quot; by itself means a quick, unexpected event or the end of an action, and is also a slang code word for having any type of sexual pleasure with another person. A loose translation could be the English word bang when used to express an act of sexual intercourse or the expression &quot;wham!&quot;. In the context of Portuguese music, the genre was christened Pimba after Emanuel&#x27;s 1995 single called Pimba Pimba.

==History==

The genre began to have a greater popularity in the 1980s and reached its apogee in the 1990s. Pimba bands and musicians or singers are influenced by the rural areas of the Portuguese countryside and the economic emigration phenomenon which was common place in Portuguese life and the society throughout the 20th century. The Pimba genre is characterized by humorous lyrics, usually charged with sexual metaphors (like Rosinha&#x27;s, Quim Barreiros&#x27; and Toy&#x27;s songs), but it can also be used to refer to singers of overly sentimental lyrics (such as Marco Paulo, Tony Carreira, Dino Meira, Mónica Sintra and Ágata) who play in local festivities across the country, usually during the Summer season, where the overly vulgar or saucy music performances were also displayed. At the onset and for many years, Pimba music and musicians or bands were object of negative criticism by some music erudites and cultural authorities, although being often much more popular and profitable across Portugal and the Portuguese expat communities abroad than other more reputable genres.

The origins of Pimba as a genre are hard to define with precision, but Portuguese singer Emanuel&#x27;s 1995 single called Pimba Pimba is regarded as a milestone in the genre&#x27;s popularity explosion even after Quim Barreiros’ 1991 and 1992 songs Bacalhau à Portuguesa (O Bacalhau Quer Alho) and O Sorveteiro (Chupa Teresa) have reached such a huge success that the genre started to be widely sought-after and appreciated nationwide by then, although still just known as Portuguese folk (or popular) music instead of Pimba music. The single Pimba Pimba eventually gave its name to this music genre. Always present in local festivities and holidays of villages and towns across the entire country, that are often connected with religious holidays in honor of a patron saint of a local community, almost always in the Summer, Pimba singers also became a must in several major university and college festivals or festivities, such as the Queima das Fitas.

Other names who were highly successful throughout the glory days of the genre include, Ana Malhoa and her father José Malhoa, the band Diapasão, Iran Costa, Fernando Correia Marques, Ruth Marlene, Micaela, Romana and Nel Monteiro.
Actress Maria João Bastos character Liliane Marise, a pimba music singer in the Portuguese telenovela &quot;Destinos Cruzados&quot; (2013/14), was so remarkable that the actress, impersonating the character, released a CD that reached first place in the Portuguese album chart and performed in Lisbon&#x27;s MEO Arena in October 2013, and also in Guimarães on 2 November 2013. In 1998 and 1999, the pimba music scene, at its most mediatic point, was parodied in RTP&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Débora&quot;, starred by Ana Bola.

<text>Acronis International GmbH, simply referred to as Acronis, is a Swiss cybersecurity and data protection technology company with its corporate headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland and global headquarters in Singapore. Acronis develops on-premises and cloud software which integrate cybersecurity, backup, disaster recovery, and endpoint management. Acronis has 15 offices worldwide. Its R&amp;D centers, Acronis Labs, are based in Bulgaria, the United States, Italy, Serbia and Singapore. Acronis has 55 cloud data centers around the world, including the United States, France, Singapore, Japan, and Germany.

==History==
Acronis was founded by Serg Bell in 2001 as a separate business unit within SWsoft. In 2003, Acronis was spun off as a separate company. The company moved from a focus on disk partitioning and boot loader software to a focus on backup and disaster recovery software based on disk imaging technology.

In 2006, SWsoft partnered with Acronis to resell Acronis True Image Server for SWsoft Plesk 8.1 control panel software. The software is standalone and works with other control panels, which enables service providers to offer backup and recovery capabilities with dedicated hosting packages.

In September 2012, Acronis acquired GroupLogic, Inc., which allowed Acronis to integrate mobile devices, including Apple, into enterprise environments through acquisition of software that formed Acronis Access Advanced. The acquisition expanded Acronis’ data protection on mobile devices. GroupLogic gained access to Acronis’ customer base.

In May 2013, co-founder and Board Director, Serg Bell, returned as CEO after working on other ventures. In December that same year, Acronis announced the launch of an official research and development wing, Acronis Labs.

Acronis won the Mobility Product of the Year award at the Network Computing Awards in 2014. In 2014, Acronis acquired BackupAgent, a cloud backup company, and , a disaster recovery software company.

The Global Partner Program through Acronis was launched in March 2015. The program gives partner companies access to the Acronis AnyData Engine. Also in 2015, Acronis won the ChannelPro Readers’ Choice Award for Best Backup and Disaster Recovery Vendor. In July 2015, Acronis announced a partnership with ProfitBrick to make Acronis Backup Cloud available for ProfitBrick&#x27;s cloud computing platform. In 2019, it was announced that Acronis would sponsor the ROKiT Williams F1 Team and SportPesa Racing Point. Acronis was the Gold Stevie Award winner under the Awards for the Innovation in Technology Development category at the 2019 Asia-Pacific Stevie Awards.

In 2019, the company acquired 5nine Software, a cloud management and security company. In 2020, the company acquired endpoint Data Loss Prevention Vendor DeviceLock. Acronis chief officers (Steiner in 2019, Magdanurov in 2020) confirmed their plans to integrate the capabilities of both software product lines into the Acronis Cyber Cloud Solutions portal over time.

In July 2021, founder and CEO Serg Bell voluntarily stepped down from his role and was replaced by Patrick Pulvermueller, former president of GoDaddy. In October 2021, Acronis partnered with Addigy, provider of the cloud-based Apple device management platform, for its latest integration of &quot;Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud&quot;. In October 2023, Patrick Pulvermueller left the company as CEO to focus on personal ventures. As of October 4, 2023, Acronis’ former Business President and Chief Corporate Development Officer, Ezequiel Steiner, was appointed the Acting CEO of Acronis. Ezequiel has almost 20 years of history with Acronis, supporting the company in different roles at different stages of its development.

<text>R2-45 is Scientology slang for murder or suicide by gun. Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard described it as &quot;an enormously effective process for exteriorization but its use is frowned upon by this society at this time&quot;. In Scientology doctrine, exteriorization refers to the separation of the thetan (soul) from the body, a phenomenon which Hubbard asserts can be achieved through Scientology auditing. R2-45 is said to be a process by which exteriorization could be produced by shooting a person in the head with a .45 caliber pistol. This literal meaning is acknowledged by the Church of Scientology, although they deny that it is meant seriously.

==Origins of R2-45==

In the book &quot;The Creation of Human Ability&quot;, Hubbard describes two training &quot;Routes&quot;, with the exercises in Route 1 numbered R1-4 to R1-15, and the exercises in Route 2 numbered R2-16 to R2-75. R2-45 is simply described as &quot;an enormously effective process for exteriorization but its use is frowned upon by this society at this time&quot;. 

Several conflicting accounts exist of where and when R2-45 originated and how it was presented by Hubbard. According to Stewart Lamont, in one of a series of lectures called the Philadelphia Doctorate Course, held from December 1 to 19, 1952, Hubbard demonstrated R2-45 by firing a Colt 45 into the floor of the podium. George Malko gives a slightly different account in his 1970 book &quot;Scientology: The Now Religion&quot;, writing that &quot;Hubbard is said to have marched out onto center stage at one of the Scientology congresses in Washington, D.C., in the late fifties, pulled out a .45 loaded with blanks, fired it into the audience, and announced to the stunned assemblage, &#x27;I just thought you&#x27;d like to see what R2-.45 looks like!&#x27;&quot; A 2007 promotional film produced by the Church of Scientology features a claimed eyewitness account of Hubbard&#x27;s introduction of R2-45. According to an unnamed veteran Scientologist who appeared in the film, R2-45 first appeared in a 1954 lecture given by Hubbard in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he described a series of auditing processes in numerical order:

Decades later, Hubbard&#x27;s estranged son Ronald DeWolf said that he had been present at a meeting where his father fired a pistol into the floor to illustrate R2-45. DeWolf commented, &quot;I thought he was kidding and that it was a blank, but it wasn&#x27;t; there was a hole in the floor. It was for real; he meant it.&quot;

==R2-45 in Hubbard&#x27;s lectures==

Hubbard mentioned R2-45 in several more lectures given to Scientologists in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1956 lecture &quot;Exteriorization&quot;, Hubbard referred in passing to R2-45; a footnote in the transcript refers to the process as being &quot;used humorously&quot;. In a lecture of 1958, Hubbard commented that &quot;Death is not the same as clearing but there is, remember, R2-45. It&#x27;s a very valid technique. A lot of people have used it before now.&quot; He said in a 1959 lecture that &quot;even cops or gangsters&quot; could make a &quot;Clear&quot; out of a person &quot;by taking a Webley 38 or Smith &amp; Wesson, or Colt or something like that and doing R2-45.&quot; An extract from this lecture was published on the Internet in 2009 by WikiLeaks. In a 1961 lecture, he said: &quot;If that fails you, well, you&#x27;ve always got suicide. You could propose that to the pc (preclear). That would solve his problems. &#x27;R2-45&#x27; by its various – various other techniques.&quot; He called it a &quot;big process&quot; that would &quot;take a pc&#x27;s head off&quot; in another lecture a few months later, to which the transcript records that the audience responded with laughter.

==R2-45 in practice==

Some critics of Scientology and ex-Scientologists have alleged that R2-45 was invoked by Hubbard to authorize the killing of individuals regarded as antagonistic to the Church of Scientology. There is no evidence that it has ever been put into practice and Hubbard did not explicitly define the meaning of R2-45 in writing. Representatives of the Church of Scientology have said that Hubbard&#x27;s description of R2-45 &quot;was coined as a joke — [it] is not authorized, and I am afraid [it] occasionally &#x27;misfires&#x27; as a joke when taken literally&quot;.

On two separate occasions orders to use R2-45 on specific individuals were published in a prominent Scientology magazine. On March 6, 1968, Hubbard issued an internal memo titled &quot;Racket Exposed&quot;, in which he denounced twelve people as &quot;Enemies of mankind, the planet and all life&quot;, and ordered that &quot;Any Sea Org member contacting any of them is to use Auditing Process R2-45.&quot; The memo was subsequently reproduced, with another name added, in the Church of Scientology&#x27;s internal journal, &quot;The Auditor&quot;. Another four people were named in a second R2-45 order published in &quot;The Auditor&quot; later in 1968. Stephen A. Kent of the University of Alberta characterises such orders as demonstrations of &quot;the manifestation of Hubbard&#x27;s malignant narcissism and, more specifically, his narcissistic rage.&quot; The Santa Rosa &quot;News-Herald&quot; reported in 1982 that &quot;attorneys have uncovered evidence to suggest that between 1975 and 1977, during the FBI&#x27;s investigation of the cult, meetings of Scientology executives were held in which there were discussions relative to &#x27;auditing&#x27; high-level FBI members with auditing process R2-45.&quot;

<text>Pacific University is a private university in Forest Grove, Oregon, United States. Founded in 1849 as the Tualatin Academy, the original Forest Grove campus is west of Portland. Affiliated with the United Church of Christ, the school maintains three other campuses in Eugene, Hillsboro, and Woodburn, and has an enrollment of more than 3,000 students. The university has Oregon&#x27;s only optometry school, and offers doctorates in 14 programs. Pacific competes in NCAA Division III as part of the Northwest Conference, with its teams known as the Boxers.

==History==

Tabitha Moffatt Brown immigrated to the Oregon Country over the new Applegate Trail in 1846. She and Harvey L. Clark started a school and orphanage in Forest Grove in 1847 to care for the orphans of Applegate Trail party. In March 1848, Tualatin Academy was established from the orphanage, with Clark donating to the school. George H. Atkinson had advocated the founding of the school and with support of the Presbyterians and Congregationalists helped start the academy. Although the university has long been independent of its founding affiliation with the United Church of Christ (UCC), it still maintains a close working relationship with the church as a member of the United Church of Christ Council for Higher Education.

Tualatin Academy was officially chartered by the territorial legislature on September 29, 1849. Clark was the first president of the board of trustees and later donated an additional to the institution. In 1851, what is now Old College Hall was built and in 1853 Sidney H. Marsh became the school&#x27;s first president. The current campus was deeded in 1851. In 1854, the institution became Pacific University. The first commencement occurred in 1863, with Harvey W. Scott as the only graduate. In 1872, three Japanese students, Hatstara Tamura, Kin Saito, and Yei Nosea, started at the university as part of Japan&#x27;s modernization movement. All three graduated in 1876. Marsh died in 1879 and was replaced by John R. Herrick.

Marsh Hall was built in 1895, serving as the central building on Pacific&#x27;s campus. Carnegie Library (now Carnegie Hall) opened in 1912 after Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s foundation helped finance the brick structure. Portland architecture firm Whidden and Lewis designed the library. In 1915, the preparatory department, Tualatin Academy, closed due to the proliferation of public high schools in Oregon. By 1920, the school had grown to five buildings on and had an endowment of about $250,000.

Marsh Hall was gutted by fire in 1975, but its shell was preserved, and the structure reopened in 1977. Phillip D. Creighton became Pacific&#x27;s 16th president in 2003 and retired in 2009. Tommy Thayer, lead guitarist of the band KISS, was elected to the university&#x27;s board of trustees in 2005. Pacific&#x27;s 17th president, Lesley M. Hallick, was named on May 19, 2009. She retired in 2022.

On February 9, 2022, Jenny Coyle was named the 18th president of Pacific University. She is the first alumnus to serve as president, having earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree, master&#x27;s degree and Doctor of Optometry from the university. Coyle previously served as a faculty member and dean of Pacific&#x27;s College of Optometry.

===Mascot===
In 1896, alumnus J.E. Walker, who had been a missionary to China, and his mother gave the university a bronze Chinese statue. Qilin (pronounced chee-lin or ki-rin) is a mythical Chinese creature with a leonine stance, a unicorn-like horn, and deer or ox hooves from the Qing Dynasty. During this period, qilin were often represented with a dragon head, fish scales, ox hooves and a lion&#x27;s tail. Said to be a good omen of wisdom and prosperity, the Pacific qilin was nicknamed Boxer by its Chinese and Japanese students as an embodiment of the community&#x27;s cultural diversity.

In the first half of the 20th century, the original mascot was the center of informal &quot;Boxer Toss&quot; events, where different clubs and groups scrimmaged for the statue as a tradition of passing its care from one group to another. In 1968, Boxer became the university&#x27;s official mascot, replacing Benny Badger.

In 1969, the statue went missing and remained so for the next 55 years. Various pieces of Boxer were returned to the university over the years, including the statue&#x27;s tail in 2012. In 2024, the original statue was returned to the university, largely intact.

Two recasts of Boxer were created in the original statue&#x27;s absence. In the 1980s, the statue was recast as Boxer II; after supposedly enjoying an epic road trip across America, it too disappeared in the mid-2000s.

In 2006, the university commissioned a 12-foot sculpture to replace the missing Boxers, which now stands in a central park welcoming students to Vandervelden Court residence hall. In 2018, alumni funded the design and casting of Boxer III by artist Pat Costello, unveiled during Homecoming weekend. Kept in trust as part of the university&#x27;s art collection, the statue and exhibits on its cultural and community history are on display in the Tran Library.

==Academics==

Pacific is home to five colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs.

===College of Arts &amp; Sciences===
Organized into 3 schools—Arts &amp; Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences—the college offers over sixty undergraduate degree options, including unique options in Asia-Pacific studies, communication sciences &amp; disorders, creative writing, editing and publishing, music therapy, outdoor leadership, nonprofit leadership, social work, and a suite of sustainability-centered art and science programs. The low-residency Masters of Fine Arts in Writing program, one of the earliest in the nation having begun in 2004, has been ranked by Poets &amp; Writers magazine as one of the nation&#x27;s top five low-residency MFA programs every year in which rankings were established. Pacific also opened a Master of Social Work program, based in Eugene, in 2014.

===College of Business===
The College of Business (COB) was founded in 2013. It offers undergraduate degrees as well as the Master of Business Administration (MBA) at the Hillsboro campus. The college is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).

===College of Education===
In 1994, the School of Education, now the College of Education, was established through reorganization of the professional teacher education programs that had been part of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 2004, the College of Health Professions was formed, now including four undergraduate programs and seven graduate programs.

===College of Health Professions===

Founded in 2006 (though several of its programs date back further), the College of Health Professions includes 13 different degree programs as well as a certification in gerontology. Most courses and clinics are on the Hillsboro campus, where the curricula focuses on interprofessional cooperation, and students gain practice in caring for underserved populations.

===College of Optometry===
The university&#x27;s College of Optometry is one of the university&#x27;s oldest colleges and one of 21 schools in the U.S. and Canada offering a doctorate in optometry. Pacific&#x27;s program dates back to 1945, when it merged with the North Pacific College of Optometry. Pacific&#x27;s College of Optometry also offers a master of vision science degree and operates eye clinic and eyeglass dispensaries in communities throughout the Portland area.

==Campuses==

Pacific University has four campuses across Oregon, in Forest Grove, Hillsboro, Eugene, and Woodburn. It also maintains satellite locations in Portland and Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i. Pacific&#x27;s Eugene campus is a single building that houses a portion of the College of Education; in 2013, Pacific opened a campus in Woodburn to provide further undergraduate and graduate programs in education.

===Forest Grove===
The Forest Grove campus features several historic buildings. Old College Hall is the oldest educational building west of the Mississippi and today serves as Pacific University&#x27;s museum. Carnegie Hall, the university&#x27;s first dedicated library building, was constructed in 1912 and today is home to the undergraduate psychology department. Marsh Hall, at the center of campus, houses several classrooms and faculty offices, in addition to administrative offices and a small auditorium. The Forest Grove campus opened a new residence hall, Cascade Hall, in 2014.

The Forest Grove campus is home to a number of sustainability initiatives in its infrastructure, earning a Silver Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS) rating in 2019. Several buildings have Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, including the Tim and Cathy Tran library, built in 2005 and remodeled with more study rooms and makers space in 2019. The LEED-certified Berglund Hall houses the College of Education and a community preschool, and Burlingham and Gilbert residence halls are LEED Gold-certified.

The Bill &amp; Cathy Stoller Center is home to the university&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams, athletic offices and the department of exercise science. It features more than 95,000 square feet of floor space, including team rooms, locker rooms, classrooms, a wood-floor gymnasium, a weight and fitness center and the Fieldhouse, the first indoor practice area in the Northwest Conference and the only one with FieldTurf. Outside the Stoller Center is the entrance to Hanson Stadium, which includes a FieldTurf soccer, lacrosse and football surface, a nine-lane track and grandstands. A new roof was built to cover the stadium grandstands in 2014. The stadium is part of the Lincoln Park Athletic Complex, built in 2008, which also houses the baseball complex, Chuck Bafaro Stadium at Bond Field, the softball complex, Sherman/Larkins Stadium, and natural grass fields for soccer and track throwing events, and is part of the City of Forest Grove&#x27;s Lincoln Park, also home to a fitness trail, playground equipment, a BMX course, a skateboard park and picnic areas.

===Hillsboro===
The Hillsboro campus opened in 2006 with its first building, a five-story LEED Gold-certified building, which was dedicated as Creighton Hall. A second building, known as HPC2 and also LEED-certified, opened in 2010. The campus is part of the Hillsboro Health &amp; Education District and is adjacent to the MAX light rail line. Primarily home to Pacific University&#x27;s College of Health Professions, the campus houses several master&#x27;s- and doctorate-level programs in health professions, as well as clinics, open to the public, for audiology, dental hygiene, physical therapy and professional psychology, as well as an interdisciplinary diabetes clinic and an eye clinic run by the Pacific University College of Optometry. The Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center also has a clinic and pharmacy on site.

<text>Nordseebilder (&quot;North Sea Pictures&quot;) op. 390 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1879.

This seascape waltz composition resulted from Strauss&#x27; visit to the North Frisian island of Föhr, when he and his second wife Angelika stayed in the town of Wyk during one of the holidays. The contrasting moods offered from living so close to the North Sea immediately galvanised Strauss&#x27; creative spirit which produced this mature work, capturing the sea storms as well as the strong gale all in 3/4 time.

Strauss&#x27; audiences in Vienna first heard the work when his brother Eduard Strauss conducted it at one of his concerts in the Musikverein on 16 November 1879. The waltz&#x27;s slow introduction suggests a calm sea scene, while swirling waves are captured in later themes. The coda incorporates the &#x27;sea storm&#x27; scene, with furious chords and fierce brass instruments suggesting the North Sea at the time of a severe gale. The first waltz theme is re-introduced before the work ends in a brilliant finish.

<text>John Michael Wallace (born October 28, 1940), is a professor of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington, as well as the former director of the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO)—a joint research venture between the University of Washington and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). His is the winner of the 2024 Japan Prize along with Sir Brian Hoskins in the field of &quot;Resources, Energy, the Environment, and Social Infrastructure&quot; for &quot;Establishment of a scientific foundation for understanding and predicting extreme weather events&quot; 

His research concerns understanding global climate and its variations using observations and covers the quasi biennial oscillation, Pacific decadal oscillation and the annular modes of the Arctic oscillation and the Antarctic oscillation, and the dominant spatial patterns in month-to-month and year-to-year climate variability, including the one through which El Niño phenomenon in the tropical Pacific influences climate over North America. He is also the coauthor with Peter V. Hobbs of what is generally considered the standard introductory textbook in the field: &quot;Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey&quot;. He was the third most cited geoscientist during the period 1973–2007.

<text>Breaza () is a town in Prahova County, Muntenia, Romania. The town center consists of at least two former villages, &quot;Podu Vadului&quot; and &quot;Breaza de Sus&quot;, which were later merged. Today, ten villages are administratively part of the town: Breaza de Jos, Breaza de Sus, Frăsinet, Gura Beliei, Irimești, Nistorești, Podu Corbului, Podu Vadului, Surdești, and Valea Târsei. 

==Geography==
The town is situated in the foothills of the Baiu and Bucegi mountains, at an altitude of about . It lies on the banks of the river Prahova, towards the southern end of the Prahova Valley. Breaza is located in the northwestern part of the county, from the county seat, Ploiești.

==History==

The town&#x27;s name is derived from a Slavic word, &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;birch tree&quot;.

The town was first documented in an act of 1503, mentioning a certain trader of Breaza called &quot;Neagoe&quot;. In 1622 the land of Breaza was divided between four boyars and in 1717, the new ruler of Wallachia, Nicolae Mavrocordat gave the Breaza estate to boyar Iordache Crețulescu. The land was divided by the agrarian reform of 1921 and in 1935 it was declared a spa.

==Economy==
One of the main occupations is farming, and traditional needlework, but many inhabitants also commute to work in the neighboring towns of Comarnic and Câmpina. Tourism is also important for the local economy, and many locals rent out rooms in the summer months.

Due to its naturally beautiful surroundings, being located among rolling hills, the town has long been popular with inhabitants of Bucharest, who tend to have vacation homes here. Among the people who had second residences in Breaza were Adrian Păunescu.

It is also the site of a folk art museum and a .

<text>Lord Robert Montagu PC (24 January 1825 – 6 May 1902) was a British Conservative politician. He served as Vice-President of the Committee on Education between 1867 and 1868.

==Background and education==
Montagu was born at Melchbourne, Bedfordshire the second son of George Montagu, 6th Duke of Manchester by his first wife Millicent, daughter of Robert Bernard Sparrow. William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester, was his elder brother. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated with an MA in 1849.

==Political career==

Montagu sat as Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire from 1859 to 1874 and for Westmeath from February 1874 until he retired in 1880. He held office under the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli as Vice-President of the Committee on Education from March 1867 until the fall of the government in December 1868 and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1867. He was an advocate of protectionist policies. He was a member of the Carlton Club and the Athenaeum Club.

==Family==
Montagu married firstly Ellen Cromie, born in 1825, daughter of John Cromie, at Portstewart on 12 February 1850. They had four children although their first son, John, died as a child. Ellen died aged 32 on 11 July 1857 at Portstewart, County Londonderry. Montagu remarried in London on 18 October 1862 to Elizabeth Wade (Holton, Suffolk, 15 May 1839 – London, 29 December 1908), daughter of William Wade of Holton, Suffolk, and had six more children. This second marriage scandalized society, since the former Betsy Wade had been a housemaid when Montagu met her. Montagu died 6 May 1902 at 91 Queens Gate, South Kensington, London and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

<text>The Arctic oscillation (AO) or Northern Annular Mode/Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode (NAM) is a weather phenomenon at the Arctic pole north of 55 degrees latitude. It is an important mode of climate variability for the Northern Hemisphere. The southern hemisphere analogue is called the Antarctic oscillation or Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The index varies over time with no particular periodicity, and is characterized by non-seasonal sea-level pressure anomalies of one sign in the Arctic, balanced by anomalies of opposite sign centered at about 37–45° N.

The North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) is a close relative of the Arctic oscillation. There is debate over whether one or the other is more fundamentally representative of the atmosphere&#x27;s dynamics. The NAO may be identified in a more physically meaningful way, which may carry more impact on measurable effects of changes in the atmosphere.

== Description ==

The Arctic oscillation appears as a ringlike (or &quot;annular&quot;) pattern of sea-level pressure anomalies centered at the poles. The presence of continents and large landmasses disrupts the ringlike structure at the Arctic pole, while anomalies surrounding the Antarctic pole are nearly circular.

The Arctic oscillation is believed by climatologists to be causally related to (and thus partially predictive of) global weather patterns. NASA climatologist James E. Hansen explained the mechanism by which the Arctic oscillation affects weather at points so distant from the Arctic, as follows (note, however, that Hansen&#x27;s explanation is erroneous: pressure in the Arctic is low in the positive AO phase, which configuration also enhances the jet stream): 
The Arctic oscillation index is defined using the daily or monthly 1000 hPa geopotential height anomalies from latitudes 20° N to 90° N. The anomalies are projected onto the Arctic oscillation loading pattern, which is defined as the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of monthly mean 1000 hPa geopotential height during the 1979-2000 period. The time series is then normalized with the monthly mean index&#x27;s standard deviation.

== Periodicity ==
Over most of the past century, the Arctic oscillation alternated between positive and negative phases. Data using a 60-day running mean has implied the oscillation has been trending to more of a positive phase since the 1970s, though it has trended to a more neutral state in the last decade. The oscillation still fluctuates stochastically between negative and positive values on daily, monthly, seasonal and annual time scales, although meteorologists have attained high levels of predictive accuracy for shorter term forecasts. The correlation between actual observations and the 7-day mean Global Forecast System ensemble AO forecasts is approximately 0.9.

This zonally symmetric seesaw between sea level pressures in polar and temperate latitudes was first identified by Edward Lorenz and named in 1998 by David W.J. Thompson and John Michael Wallace.
== Impacts ==
The National Snow and Ice Data Center describes the effects of the Arctic oscillation in some detail. In the positive phase, higher pressure at midlatitudes drives ocean storms farther north, and changes in the circulation pattern bring wetter weather to Alaska, Scotland and Scandinavia, as well as drier conditions to the western United States and the Mediterranean. In the positive phase, frigid winter air does not extend as far into the middle of North America as it would during the negative phase of the oscillation. This keeps much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains warmer than normal, but leaves Greenland and Newfoundland colder than usual. Weather patterns in the negative phase are in general &quot;opposite&quot; to those of the positive phase.

Climatologists are now routinely invoking the Arctic oscillation in their official public explanations for extremes of weather. The following statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s National Climatic Data Center: &quot;State of the Climate December 2010&quot; which uses the phrase &quot;negative Arctic Oscillation&quot; four times, is very representative of this increasing tendency:
:&quot;Cold arctic air gripped western Europe in the first three weeks of December. Two major snowstorms, icy conditions, and frigid temperatures wreaked havoc across much of the region...The harsh winter weather was attributed to a negative Arctic Oscillation, which is a climate pattern that influences weather in the Northern Hemisphere. A very persistent, strong ridge of high pressure, or &#x27;blocking system&#x27;, near Greenland allowed cold Arctic air to slide south into Europe. Europe was not the only region in the Northern Hemisphere affected by the Arctic Oscillation. A large snow storm and frigid temperatures affected much of the Midwest United States on December 10–13...&quot;

== Events of 2010 ==

A further, quite graphic illustration of the effects of the negative phase of the oscillation occurred in February 2010. In that month, the Arctic oscillation reached its most negative monthly mean value at about −4.266, in the entire post-1950 era (the period of accurate record-keeping). That month was characterized by three separate historic snowstorms in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The first storm precipitated on Baltimore, Maryland on February 5–6, and a second storm precipitated on February 9–10. In New York City, a separate storm deposited on February 25–26. 
Another snowstorm swept Catalonia as well as neighbouring French departments (Languedoc-Roussillon, Midi-Pyrenées) on March 8, depositing 60 cm of snow in Girona. This kind of snowstorm activity is considered to be highly anomalous, and as extreme as the negative Arctic oscillation value itself. These negative values of the AO during 2010 and following into the next winter allowed colder air to penetrate much further south than usual into sub-tropical South Florida which brought record breaking low temperatures and months registered in many locations and the coolest average monthly minimum temperatures for February, March and December that year in the tropical beach getaway of Cancún, up to over 4C below the climate period averages.

The greatest negative value for the Arctic oscillation since 1950 in January was −3.767 in 1977, which coincided with the coldest mean January temperature in New York City, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and many other mid-Atlantic locations in that span of time, although the January Arctic oscillation has been negative only 60.6% of the time between 1950 and 2010, nine of the ten coldest Januarys in New York City since 1950 have coincided with negative Arctic oscillations.

<text>Global Hybrid Cooperation, formerly Advanced Hybrid System 2 (AHS2), is a set of hybrid vehicle technologies jointly developed by General Motors, Daimler, and Chrysler LLC, with BMW joining in 2005. It uses 2 or 3 planetary gearsets in an automatic transmission: one on the internal combustion engine (ICE) side (input split) paired with a second (output split), forming the compound split, and possibly one third additional planetary gearset to multiply the number of fixed gear ratios (up to 4). General Motors has stopped using the &quot;AHS2&quot; name as of 2006, preferring to call it simply a two-mode hybrid system.

This technology was named as &quot;Technology of the Year&quot; for 2007 by &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine.

==History==
The dual-mode hybrid concept, as described in 1994, was developed to optimize vehicle efficiency by switching between parallel and series hybrid operation, taking advantage of series operation in stop-and-go traffic to minimize engine speed variance, and parallel operation at highway speeds to use efficient mechanical transmission. On September 30, 1993, the United States Department of Energy signed a contract with General Motors to develop and demonstrate hybrid electric powertrains for light duty vehicles. AHS-2 was derived from a dual-mode hybrid system developed earlier by Allison Transmission, then a division of GM, for transit buses. The Allison system first had been announced for buses in 2003.

===Partnership formed===
The GM/DaimlerChrysler partnership was announced on December 13, 2004, with Dieter Zetsche of DaimlerChrysler joining Rick Wagoner of GM on stage with a prototype. Negotiations had begun earlier in October, after engineering managers at both companies discovered they were independently working on similar dual-mode hybrid concepts while participating on the same conference panel. The agreement was not signed until the following August, however. GM was reportedly responsible for development of rear- and four-wheel drive truck and front wheel drive car systems while DaimlerChrysler was focused on a rear wheel drive luxury car application. It was announced on September 7, 2005, that BMW would also join the alliance, likely using then-archrival DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s rear wheel drive system.

The three companies formed an organization called Global Hybrid Cooperation with engineering and management centered at the GM, DaimlerChrysler and BMW Hybrid Development Center in Troy, Michigan. In 2006, an article published by &quot;Autoweek&quot; stated the three automakers planned to spend US$1 billion collectively to develop the front- and rear-wheel drive hybrid transmissions.

===Vehicles introduced===
The two-mode hybrid system was introduced to the light-duty vehicle market as a drivetrain option for the 2008 model year Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, with an observed improvement in fuel economy of 27–58% compared to a conventionally-powered equivalent. GM introduced the hybrid option for 2009 model year Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, and Cadillac Escalade. The largest improvement was in the EPA city rating. The dual-mode hybrid equipment added approximately , but this increase was offset completely by lighter seats, wheels, and 12-volt battery; aluminum engine and body components; and eliminating the starter motor. It was equipped with a 6.0L &quot;LFA&quot; and &quot;LZ1&quot; V-8 engines featuring Active Fuel Management, which was larger than the standard 5.3L &quot;LY5&quot; base engine.

The GM products were followed by a hybrid Dodge Durango and related Chrysler Aspen for the 2009 model year in late 2008; the 5.7L HEMI V-8 engine on these was equipped with a stop-start system to improve fuel economy. BMW and Mercedes introduced the X6 ActiveHybrid and ML450 Hybrid, respectively, in 2009, but these were discontinued in 2011.

===Dissolution===
Earlier, on March 1, 2007, BMW and DaimlerChrysler announced that they were entering a separate partnership to develop a mild hybrid module for rear wheel drive premium cars. They planned to roll out the new system within the next three years on BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. GM did not participate in the new partnership, and did not announce plans to develop a similar hybrid RWD system for cars.

In 2009 Mercedes released the S400 mild hybrid, using a lithium ion battery. It was reported in July 2009 that after the upcoming introductions of two-mode hybrid models of the BMW X6 (marketed globally) and the Mercedes-Benz M class (only in the United States), the two-mode hybrid joint venture would be dissolved. Daimler indicated that it wants to avoid investing in aftersales and service for a vehicle which will only be produced in small quantities, and will instead concentrate on modular hybrid building blocks with scalable lithium-ion batteries, based on the hybrid drive developed for the S-class and 7 Series sedans by the joint venture with BMW and auto supplier Continental AG.

By 2014, the two-mode hybrid drivetrain was no longer offered on any light-duty vehicles.

==Technology==
===Components===
The dual-mode hybrid drive unit includes two AC motor-generators (MG-A and MG-B, each are three-phase permanent magnet machines with peak output), three interconnected planetary gear sets (P1, P2, and P3), four selectively engaging friction clutches (C1, C2, C3, and C4), and two oil pumps.

This hybrid drive unit is coupled to the engine, taking the place of a conventional transmission. The engine crankshaft is coupled to the drive unit using a clutch and a torque damper (TD), replacing the torque converter used in most automatic transmissions. The entire drive unit is comparable in size and shape to an Allison 1000 transmission. A 300 volt battery pack is used to store energy for the two motor-generators.

===Overview===
General Motors has designated the drive unit as the 2ML70; for BMW and DaimlerChrysler vehicles, it is the GM-Allison AHS-2. The technology is known as a &quot;two-mode&quot; hybrid system because the transmission / drive unit can transfer either electrical power, mechanical power, or a blend of both to the wheels, operating both as a series hybrid, using the internal combustion engine solely to generate electrical power, or as a parallel hybrid, using the electrical motor(s) to augment the mechanical power from the engine. The two modes of operation are:

# Input-split mode — C1 engaged; the rotational speed of the 2nd motor (MG-B) is always proportional to the output shaft, while the 1st motor (MG-A) is not proportional to the input shaft. The 2nd electric motor direct drive the output, and it is possible to drive the vehicle without combustion engine. The power flow is split only at the input, that is why it is called &quot;Input-split&quot;. At low speeds, the vehicle can move with either the electric motor/generators, the internal combustion engine, or both, making it a so-called full hybrid. All accessories will still remain functioning on electric power, and the engine can restart instantly if needed. In this mode, one of the motor/generators (MG-A) acts as a generator, while the other operates as a motor (MG-B). This mode is operational for the two continuously variable ranges (&quot;input split and compound split&quot;) of the transmission. 
# Compound-split mode — C1 disengaged, C2 engaged; the rotational speed of the 2nd motor (MG-B) is not proportional to the output shaft, like the 1st motor (MG-A) is not proportional to the input shaft. The power flow is split at the input and at the output, that is why it is called &quot;Compound-split&quot;. It is impossible to drive the vehicle without combustion engine. This mode begins at the point where one of the motor/generators reaches zero speed; at this point some clutches within the system engage while others disengage to alter the physical configuration of the transmission, and the velocity is Vshift. Immediately after the shift, both electric machines operate as motors and the first gear ratio is employed. At a given velocity above Vshift, the second gear ratio is employed, and MG-B begins to operate as a generator, while also slowing down its angular speed.
This system amplifies the output of the electric motors similarly to the way in which a conventional transmission amplifies the torque of an internal combustion engine. It also, when required, permits transfer of more of the engine&#x27;s torque to the wheels, making the transmission more efficient even without the electric motors in use. Although the transmission mechanically has only four conventional gear ratios, the electric motors allow it to function as a continuously variable transmission. This variable ratio functions in addition to the torque multiplication of the planetary gears.

===How it works===

Mode I (&quot;input-split&quot;) is intended for the range of speeds commonly encountered during urban driving, while Mode II (&quot;compound-split&quot;) is intended for the higher range of speeds encountered during highway travel. Within these modes, there are four possible fixed gear ratios, two in each mode, in which one additional clutch is engaged.

The lowest fixed gear ratio, which is in Mode I, synchronizes both motor-generators, allowing the vehicle to use these as motors to augment mechanical power for stronger acceleration, or as generators for regenerative braking. The second fixed gear ratio, also in Mode I, allows the motor-generators to freewheel which reduces losses at higher speeds and improves overall efficiency.

Similarly, the third fixed gear ratio, which is in Mode II, synchronizes both motor-generators to allow electric motor boost or regenerative braking, and the fourth fixed gear ratio, also in Mode II, allows both motor-generators to freewheel for improved efficiency, relying solely on mechanical power transmission to move the vehicle.

Generally, the vehicle will start from rest in Mode I; as speeds increase, the transmission will transition to the first fixed gear ratio, shift back to Mode I, then transition to the second fixed gear ratio before entering Mode II.

In Mode II, unlike Mode I, there are no defined speed setpoints to enter or leave the third or fourth fixed gear ratios, but the third fixed gear ratio is intended for changing speeds (accelerating to pass or slowing), using inputs from the throttle position, while the fourth fixed gear ratio serves the same purpose as an overdrive ratio, for improved efficiency at high speeds.

When reversing, the vehicle remains in Mode I, using one of the motor-generators for traction.

Operation of the Allison Transmission (AHS-2), or Two-Mode Hybrid, from the Global Hybrid Cooperation. This transmission is mounted on the BMW X6 ActiveHybrid and the Mercedes-Benz ML450 BlueHybrid.


Per the patent, the planetary gearsets P1 and P2 are compounded, with MG-A driving (or being driven by) the sun gear of P1, which is coupled to the ring gear of P2, and the carriers for the planet gears in P1 and P2 are coupled. Similarly, MG-B drives (or is driven by) the sun gear of P2, which is coupled to the sun gear of P3 via a hollow shaft.

===Comparison with other hybrid systems===
Toyota&#x27;s Hybrid Synergy Drive may appear similar in that it also combines the power from an ICE and a pair of electric motor–generators; however in its current form, Toyota uses only one planetary gearset providing only single mode functionality (i.e. input split only) using a series/parallel architecture.

Honda&#x27;s Integrated Motor Assist uses a traditional ICE and transmission where the flywheel is replaced with an electric motor: it is a simple parallel architecture, requiring the addition of a mechanical continuously variable transmission (CVT), i.e. not electrically variable.
==Applications==
===Buses===

The two-mode hybrid drive system manufactured by Allison Transmission was first used in New Flyer transit buses which entered revenue service in 2004; in testing at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, measured fuel economy improved from for conventional diesel bus to with the hybrid drive unit in an equivalent bus over the same operating cycles, representing an improvement of – %.

By 2008, Allison had delivered 1,000 hybrid powertrains. Many transit operators since then have received buses with the Allison hybrid system, including:
* King County, Washington King County Metro (361 New Flyer buses announced from 2002 to present) The first DE60LF, serial 24129
* Albuquerque, New Mexico ABQ RIDE (112 New Flyer buses announced from December 21, 2004, to present)

* Shreveport, Louisiana SporTran (one bus announced June 9, 2005)
* Charlotte, North Carolina Charlotte Area Transit System (2 buses announced June 9, 2005)
* Springfield, Massachusetts Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (one bus announced October 14, 2005)
* Aspen, Colorado Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (seven buses announced December 9, 2005)
* Consortium (led by San Joaquin RTD) of 10 transit agencies in California and Nevada (157 Gillig buses announced March 20, 2006).
** Note: ABQ RIDE of Albuquerque, New Mexico was formerly a member of this consortium, but instead chose to order New Flyer buses on their own instead.
* Madison, Wisconsin Madison Metro (5 Gillig buses announced September 11, 2007, with 10 more planned for purchase in the next few years)

In 2020, Allison introduced its second generation two-mode hybrid drive units, branded eGen Flex, upgrading the existing H 40 EP and H 50 EP drive units with a disconnect clutch, allowing the engine to shut off completely, and adding a second line branded eGen Flex Max, which offers fully-electric propulsion with a lithium-titanate battery chemistry.

<text>Cidofovir, brand name Vistide, is a topical or injectable antiviral medication primarily used as a treatment for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis (an infection of the retina of the eye) in people with AIDS.

Cidofovir was approved for medical use in 1996.

==Medical use==

===DNA virus===
Its only indication that has received regulatory approval worldwide is cytomegalovirus retinitis. Cidofovir has also shown efficacy in the treatment of aciclovir-resistant HSV infections. Cidofovir has also been investigated as a treatment for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with successful case reports of its use. Despite this, the drug failed to demonstrate any efficacy in controlled studies. Cidofovir might have anti-smallpox efficacy and might be used on a limited basis in the event of a bioterror incident involving smallpox cases. Brincidofovir, a cidofovir derivative with much higher activity against smallpox that can be taken orally has been developed. It has inhibitory effects on varicella-zoster virus replication &quot;in vitro&quot; although no clinical trials have been done to date, likely due to the abundance of safer alternatives such as aciclovir. Cidofovir shows anti-BK virus activity in a subgroup of transplant recipients. Cidofovir is being investigated as a complementary intralesional therapy against papillomatosis caused by HPV.

It first received FDA approval on 26 June 1996, TGA approval on 30 April 1998 and EMA approval on 23 April 1997.

It has been used topically to treat warts.

===Other===
It has been suggested as an antitumour agent, due to its suppression of FGF2.

==Administration==
Cidofovir is only available as an intravenous formulation. Cidofovir is to be administered with probenecid which decreases side effects to the kidney. Probenecid mitigates nephrotoxicity by inhibiting organic anion transport of the proximal tubule epithelial cells of the kidney. In addition, hydration must be administered to patients receiving cidofovir. 1 liter of normal saline is recommended in conjunction with each dose of cidofovir.

==Side effects==
The major dose-limiting side effect of cidofovir is nephrotoxicity (i.e., kidney damage). Other common side effects (occurring in &gt;1% of people treated with the drug) include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Neutropenia
* Hair loss
* Weakness
* Headache
* Chills
* Decreased intraocular pressure
* Uveitis
* Iritis

Whereas uncommon side effects include: anaemia and elevated liver enzymes and rare side effects include: tachycardia and Fanconi syndrome. Probenecid (a uricosuric drug) and intravenous saline should always be administered with each cidofovir infusion to prevent this nephrotoxicity.

===Contraindications===
Hypersensitivity to cidofovir or probenecid (as probenecid needs to be given concurrently to avoid nephrotoxicity).

== Interactions ==
It is known to interact with nephrotoxic agents (e.g. amphotericin B, foscarnet, IV aminoglycosides, IV pentamide, vancomycin, tacrolimus, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, etc.) to increase their nephrotoxic potential. As it must be given concurrently with probenecid it is advised that drugs that are known to interact with probenecid (e.g. drugs that probenecid interferes with the renal tubular secretion of, such as paracetamol, aciclovir, aminosalicylic acid, etc.) are also withheld.

==Mechanism of action==
Its active metabolite, cidofovir diphosphate, inhibits viral replication by selectively inhibiting viral DNA polymerases. It also inhibits human polymerases, but this action is 8–600 times weaker than its actions on viral DNA polymerases. It also incorporates itself into viral DNA, hence inhibiting viral DNA synthesis during reproduction.

It possesses &quot;in vitro&quot; activity against the following viruses:
* Human herpesviruses
* Adenoviruses
* Human poxviruses (including the smallpox virus)
* Human papillomavirus

==History==
Cidofovir was discovered at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Prague, by Antonín Holý, and developed by Gilead Sciences and is marketed with the brand name Vistide by Gilead in the US, and by Pfizer elsewhere.

==Synthesis==
Cidofovir can be synthesized from a pyrimidone derivative and a protected derivative of glycidol.

* Brincidofovir, a prodrug of cidofovir

<text>Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD), also known as Toyota Hybrid System II, is the brand name of Toyota Motor Corporation for the hybrid car drive train technology used in vehicles with the Toyota and Lexus marques. First introduced on the Prius, the technology is an option on several other Toyota and Lexus vehicles and has been adapted for the electric drive system of the hydrogen-powered Mirai, and for a plug-in hybrid version of the Prius. Previously, Toyota also licensed its HSD technology to Nissan for use in its Nissan Altima Hybrid. Its parts supplier Aisin offers similar hybrid transmissions to other car companies.

HSD technology produces a full hybrid vehicle which allows the car to run on the electric motor only, as opposed to most other brand hybrids which cannot and are considered mild hybrids. The HSD also combines an electric drive and a planetary gearset which performs similarly to a continuously variable transmission. The Synergy Drive is a drive-by-wire system with no direct mechanical connection between the engine and the engine controls: both the gas pedal/accelerator and the gearshift lever in an HSD car merely send electrical signals to a control computer.
HSD is a refinement of the original Toyota Hybrid System (THS) used in the 1997 to 2003 Toyota Prius. The second generation system first appeared on the redesigned Prius in 2004. The name was changed in anticipation of its use in vehicles outside the Toyota brand (Lexus; the HSD-derived systems used in Lexus vehicles have been termed Lexus Hybrid Drive), was implemented in the 2006 Camry and Highlander, and would eventually be implemented in the 2010 &quot;third generation&quot; Prius, and the 2012 Prius c. The Toyota Hybrid System is designed for increased power and efficiency, and also improved &quot;scalability&quot; (adaptability to larger as well as smaller vehicles), wherein the ICE/MG1 and the MG2 have separate reduction paths, and are combined in a &quot;compound&quot; gear which is connected to the final reduction gear train and differential; it was introduced on all-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive Lexus models. By May 2007 Toyota had sold one million hybrids worldwide; two million by the end of August 2009; and passed the 5 million mark in March 2013. , more than 7 million Lexus and Toyota hybrids had been sold worldwide. The United States accounted for 38% of TMC global hybrid sales .
== Principle ==
Toyota&#x27;s HSD system replaces a normal geared transmission with an electromechanical system. An internal combustion engine (ICE) delivers power most efficiently over a small speed range, but the wheels need to be driven over the vehicle&#x27;s full speed range. In a conventional automobile the geared transmission delivers different discrete engine speed-torque power requirements to the wheels. Geared transmissions may be manual, with a clutch, or automatic, with a torque converter, but both allow the engine and the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The driver can adjust the speed and torque delivered by the engine with the accelerator and the transmission mechanically transmits nearly all of the available power to the wheels which rotate at a different rate than the engine, by a factor equal to the gear ratio for the currently selected gear. However, there are a limited number of &quot;gears&quot; or gear ratios that the driver can choose from, typically four to six. This limited gear-ratio set forces the engine crankshaft to rotate at speeds where the ICE is less efficient, i.e., where a liter of fuel produces fewer joules. Optimal engine speed-torque requirements for different vehicle driving and acceleration conditions can be gauged by limiting either tachometer RPM rate or engine noise in comparison with actual speed. When an engine is required to operate efficiently across a broad RPM range, due to its coupling to a geared transmission, manufacturers are limited in their options for improving engine efficiency, reliability, or lifespan, as well as reducing the size or weight of the engine. This is why the engine for an engine-generator is often much smaller, more efficient, more reliable, and longer life than one designed for an automobile or other variable speed application.

However, a continuously variable transmission allows the driver (or the automobile computer) to effectively select the optimal gear ratio required for any desired speed or power. The transmission is not limited to a fixed set of gears. This lack of constraint frees the engine to operate at its optimal brake-specific fuel consumption. An HSD vehicle will typically run the engine at its optimal efficiency whenever power is needed to charge batteries or accelerate the car, shutting down the engine entirely when less power is required.

Like a CVT, an HSD transmission continuously adjusts the effective gear ratio between the engine and the wheels to maintain the engine speed while the wheels increase their rotational speed during acceleration. This is why Toyota describes HSD-equipped vehicles as having an e-CVT (electronic continuously variable transmission) when required to classify the transmission type for standards specification lists or regulatory purposes.

=== Power flows ===
In a conventional car design the separately-excited alternator with integral rectifier (DC generator) and starter (DC motor) are considered accessories that are attached to the internal combustion engine (ICE) which normally drives a transmission to power the wheels propelling the vehicle. A battery is used only to start the car&#x27;s internal combustion engine and run accessories when the engine is not running. The alternator is used to recharge the battery and run the accessories when the engine is running.

The HSD system replaces the geared transmission, alternator, and starter motor with:
* MG1, an AC motor-generator having a permanent magnet rotor, used as a motor when starting the ICE and as a generator (alternator) when charging the high voltage battery
* MG2, an AC motor-generator, also having a permanent magnet rotor, used as the primary drive motor and as a generator (alternator), which regeneration power is directed to the high voltage battery. MG2 is generally the more powerful of the two motor-generators
* Power electronics, including three DC-AC inverters and two DC-DC converters
* Computerized control system and sensors
* HVB, a high voltage battery sources electrical energy during acceleration and sinks electrical energy during regeneration braking

Through the power splitter, a series-parallel full hybrid&#x27;s HSD system thus allows for the following intelligent power flows:

*Auxiliary power
**HVB -&gt; DC-DC converter -&gt; 12VDC battery
**12VDC battery -&gt; 12V vehicle electronics
*Engine charge (Recharging and/or heating catalytic converter and/or interior comfort HVAC)
**ICE -&gt; MG1 -&gt; HVB
*Battery or EV drive 
** HVB -&gt; MG2 -&gt; wheels
*Engine &amp; motor drive (Moderate acceleration)
** ICE -&gt; wheels 
** ICE -&gt; MG1 -&gt; MG2 -&gt; wheels
*Engine drive with charge (Highway driving)
** ICE -&gt; wheels
** ICE -&gt; MG1 -&gt; HVB 
*Engine and motor drive with charge (Heavy power situation such as in steep hills)
** ICE -&gt; wheels
** ICE -&gt; MG1 -&gt; HVB 
** ICE -&gt; MG1 -&gt; MG2 -&gt; wheels
*Full power or gradual slowing (Maximum power situations)
** ICE -&gt; wheels
** ICE -&gt; MG1 -&gt; MG2 -&gt; wheels
** HVB -&gt; MG2 -&gt; wheels
*B-mode braking
** Wheels -&gt; MG2 -&gt;HVB
** Wheels -&gt; MG1 -&gt; ICE (ECU - Electronic Control Unit - uses MG1 to spin ICE which drains battery – allowing more charge from MG2, and also links ICE to wheels causing &quot;engine braking&quot;; ICE RPM increases when charge level of HVB is too much to accept regen electricity from MG2, or increasing effort from driver pushing the brake pedal)
*Regenerative braking
** wheels -&gt; MG2 -&gt; HVB
*Hard braking
** Front disk/rear drum (rear disk in UK) -&gt; wheels
** All disk -&gt; wheels (2010 and newer, except 2012-current Prius c, which uses front disk, rear drum).

==== MG1 and MG2 ====
* MG1 (Primary motor-generator): A motor to start the ICE and a generator to generate electrical power for MG2 and to recharge the high voltage traction battery, and, through a DC-to-DC converter, to recharge the 12 volt auxiliary battery. By regulating the amount of electrical power generated (by varying MG1&#x27;s mechanical torque and speed), MG1 effectively controls the transaxle&#x27;s continuously variable transmission.
* MG2 (Secondary motor-generator): Drives the wheels and regenerates power for the HV battery energy storage while braking the vehicle. MG2 drives the wheels with electrical power generated by the engine-driven MG1 and/or the HVB. During regenerative braking, MG2 acts as a generator, converting kinetic energy into electrical energy, storing this electrical energy in the battery.

=== Transmission ===
The mechanical gearing design of the system allows the mechanical power from the ICE to be split three ways: extra torque at the wheels (under constant rotation speed), extra rotation speed at the wheels (under constant torque), and power for an electric generator. A computer running appropriate programs controls the systems and directs the power flow from the different engine + motor sources. This power split achieves the benefits of a continuously variable transmission (CVT), except that the torque/speed conversion uses an electric motor rather than a direct mechanical gear train connection. An HSD car cannot operate without the computer, power electronics, battery pack, and motor-generators, though in principle it could operate while missing the internal combustion engine. (See: Plug-in hybrid) In practice, HSD equipped cars can be driven a mile or two without gasoline, as an emergency measure to reach a gas station.

An HSD transaxle contains a planetary gear set that adjusts and blends the amount of torque from the engine and motor(s) as it&#x27;s needed by the front wheels. It is a sophisticated and complicated combination of gearing, electrical motor-generators, and computer-controlled electronic controls. One of the motor-generators, MG2, is connected to the output shaft, and thus couples torque into or out of the drive shafts; feeding electricity into MG2 adds torque at the wheels. The engine end of the drive shaft has a second differential; one leg of this differential is attached to the internal combustion engine and the other leg is attached to a second motor-generator, MG1. The differential relates the rotation speed of the wheels to the rotation speeds of the engine and MG1, with MG1 used to absorb the difference between wheel and engine speed. The differential is an epicyclic gear set (also called a &quot;power split device&quot;); that and the two motor-generators are all contained in a single transaxle housing that is bolted to the engine. Special couplings and sensors monitor rotation speed of each shaft and the total torque on the drive shafts, for feedback to the control computer.
In Generation 1 and Generation 2 HSDs, MG2 is directly connected to the ring gear, that is, a 1:1 ratio, and which offers no torque multiplication, whereas in Generation 3 HSDs, MG2 is connected to the ring gear through a 2.5:1 planetary gear set, and which, consequently, offers a 2.5:1 torque multiplication, this being a primary benefit of the Generation 3 HSD as it provides for a smaller, yet more powerful MG2. However, a secondary benefit is the MG1 will not be driven into overspeed as frequently, and which would otherwise mandate employing the ICE to mitigate this overspeed; this strategy improves HSD performance as well as saving fuel and wear-and-tear on the ICE.

===High voltage battery===

The HSD system has two principal battery packs, the High Voltage (HV) battery, also known as the traction battery, and a 12 volt lead-acid battery known as the Low Voltage (LV) battery, which functions as an auxiliary battery. The LV battery supplies power to the electronics and accessories when the hybrid system is turned off and the high-voltage battery main relay is off.

The traction battery is a sealed nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) battery pack. The battery pack of the first generation Toyota Prius consisted of 228 cells packaged in 38 modules, while the second generation Prius consisted of 28 Panasonic prismatic nickel metal hydride modules, each containing six 1.2 volt cells, connected in series to produce a nominal voltage of 201.6 volts. The discharge power capability of the second gen Prius pack is about 20 kW at 50% state of charge (SoC). The power capability increases with higher temperatures and decreases at lower temperatures. The Prius has a computer that&#x27;s solely dedicated to keeping the battery at the optimum temperature and optimum charge level.

Like the second generation Prius, the third generation Prius battery pack is made up of the same type of 1.2 volt cells. It has 28 modules of 6 cells for a total nominal voltage of only 201.6 volts. A boost converter is used 
to produce 500 volt DC supply voltage for the inverters for MG1 and MG2. The car&#x27;s electronics only allow 40% of total rated capacity of the battery pack (6.5 ampere-hour) to be used in order to prolong the battery life. As a result, the SoC is allowed to vary only between 40% and 80% of the rated full charge. The battery used in the Highlander Hybrid and the Lexus RX 400h was packaged in a different metal battery casing with 240 cells that deliver high voltage of 288 volts. 

A button labelled &quot;EV&quot; maintains electric vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than if the traction battery has enough charge. This permits all-electric driving with no fuel consumption for up to . However, the HSD software switches to EV mode automatically whenever it can. Only the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid has a longer driving all-electric range in blended operation electric-gasoline of (EPA rating) until the battery is depleted. The Prius PHEV is outfitted with 4.4 kWh lithium-ion batteries co-developed with Panasonic that weighs compared with the nickel-metal hydride battery of the third generation Prius, which has a capacity of only 1.3 kWh, and weighs . The larger battery pack enables all-electric operation at higher speeds and longer distances than the conventional Prius hybrid.

The following table details the HV battery capacity for several Lexus and Toyota vehicles.

== Operation ==
The HSD drive works by shunting electrical power between the two motor generators, running off the battery pack, to even out the load on the internal combustion engine. Since a power boost from the electrical motors is available for periods of rapid acceleration, the ICE can be downsized to match only the average load on the car, rather than sized by peak power demands for rapid acceleration. The smaller internal combustion engine can be designed to run more efficiently. Furthermore, during normal operation the engine can be operated at or near its ideal speed and torque level for power, economy, or emissions, with the battery pack absorbing or supplying power as appropriate to balance the demand placed by the driver. During traffic stops the internal combustion engine can even be turned off for even more economy.

The combination of efficient car design, regenerative braking, turning the engine off for traffic stops, significant electrical energy storage and efficient internal combustion engine design give the HSD powered car significant efficiency advantages—particularly in city driving.

=== Phases of operation ===

The HSD operates in distinct phases depending on speed and demanded torque. Here are a few of them:
* Battery charging: The HSD can charge its battery without moving the car, by running the engine and extracting electrical power from MG1. The power gets shunted into the battery, and no torque is supplied to the wheels. The onboard computer does this when required, for example when stopped in traffic or to warm up the engine and catalytic converter after a cold start.
* Engine start: To start the engine, power is applied to MG1 to act as a starter. Because of the size of the motor generators, starting the engine is relatively fast and requires relatively little power from MG1. Additionally, the conventional starter motor sound is not heard. Engine start can occur while stopped or moving.
* Reverse gear (equivalent): There is no reverse gear as in a conventional gearbox: the computer reverses the phase sequence to AC motor-generator MG2, applying negative torque to the wheels. Early models did not supply enough torque for some situations: there have been reports of early Prius owners not being able to back the car up steep hills in San Francisco. The problem has been fixed in recent models. If the battery is low, the system can simultaneously run the engine and draw power from MG1, although this will reduce available reverse torque at the wheels.
* Neutral gear (equivalent): Most jurisdictions require automotive transmissions to have a neutral gear that decouples the engine and transmission. The HSD &quot;neutral gear&quot; is achieved by turning the electric motors off. Under this condition, the planetary gear is stationary (if the vehicle wheels are not turning); if the vehicle wheels are turning, the ring gear will rotate, causing the sun gear to rotate as well (the engine inertia will keep the carrier gear stationary unless the speed is high), while MG1 is free to rotate while the batteries do not charge. The owners manual warns that Neutral gear will eventually drain the battery, resulting in &quot;unnecessary&quot; engine power to recharge batteries; a discharged battery will render the vehicle inoperable.

* EV operation: At slow speeds and moderate torques the HSD can operate without running the internal combustion engine at all: electricity is supplied only to MG2, allowing MG1 to rotate freely (and thus decoupling the engine from the wheels). This is popularly known as &quot;Stealth Mode&quot;. Provided that there is enough battery power, the car can be driven in this silent mode for some miles even without gasoline.
* Low gear (equivalent): When accelerating at low speeds in normal operation, the engine turns more rapidly than the wheels but does not develop sufficient torque. The extra engine speed is fed to MG1 acting as a generator. The output of MG1 is fed to MG2, acting as a motor and adding torque at the driveshaft.
* High gear (equivalent): When cruising at high speed, the engine turns more slowly than the wheels but develops more torque than needed. MG2 then runs as a generator to remove the excess engine torque, producing power that is fed to MG1 acting as a motor to increase the wheel speed. In steady state, the engine provides all of the power to propel the car unless the engine is unable to supply it (as during heavy acceleration, or driving up a steep incline at high speed). In this case, the battery supplies the difference. Whenever the required propulsion power changes, the battery quickly balances the power budget, allowing the engine to change power relatively slowly.
* Regenerative braking: By drawing power from MG2 and depositing it into the battery pack, the HSD can simulate the deceleration of normal engine braking while saving the power for future boost. The regenerative brakes in an HSD system absorb a significant amount of the normal braking load, so the conventional brakes on HSD vehicles are undersized compared to brakes on a conventional car of similar mass and last significantly longer.
* Engine braking: The HSD system has a special transmission setting labelled &#x27;B&#x27; (for Brake), that takes the place of a conventional automatic transmission&#x27;s &#x27;L&#x27; setting, providing engine braking on hills. This can be manually selected in place of regenerative braking. During braking, when the battery is approaching potentially damaging high charge levels, the electronic control system automatically switches to conventional engine braking, drawing power from MG2 and shunting it to MG1, speeding the engine with throttle closed to absorb energy and decelerate the vehicle.
* Electric boost: The battery pack provides a reservoir of energy that allows the computer to match the demand on the engine to a predetermined optimal load curve, rather than operating at the torque and speed demanded by the driver and road. The computer manages the energy level stored in the battery, so as to have capacity to absorb extra energy where needed or supply extra energy to boost engine power.

=== Performance ===

The Toyota Prius has modest acceleration but has extremely high efficiency for a midsized four-door sedan: usually significantly better than 40 mpg (US) (5.9 L/100 km) is typical of brief city jaunts; 55 mpg (4.3 L/100 km) is not uncommon, especially for extended drives at modest speeds (a longer drive allows the engine to warm up fully). This is approximately twice the fuel efficiency of a similarly equipped four-door sedan with a conventional power train. Not all of the extra efficiency of the Prius is due to the HSD system: the Atkinson cycle engine itself was also designed specifically to minimize engine drag via an offset crankshaft to minimize piston drag during the power stroke, and a unique intake system to prevent drag caused by manifold vacuum (&quot;pumping losses&quot;) versus the normal Otto cycle in most engines. Furthermore, the Atkinson cycle recovers more energy per cycle than the Otto because of its longer power stroke. The downside of the Atkinson cycle is much reduced torque, particularly at low speed; but the HSD has enormous low-speed torque available from MG2.

The Highlander Hybrid (also sold as the Kluger in some countries) offers better acceleration performance compared to its non-hybrid version. The hybrid version goes from 0–60 mph in 7.2 seconds, trimming almost a second off the conventional version&#x27;s time. Net power is compared to the conventional . Top speed for all Highlanders is limited to . Typical fuel economy for the Highlander Hybrid rates between 27 and 31 mpg (8.7–7.6 L/100 km). A conventional Highlander is rated by the EPA with 19 city, 25 highway mpg (12.4 and 9.4 L/100 km respectively).

The HSD mileage boost depends on using the gasoline engine as efficiently as possible, which requires:
* extended drives, especially in winter: Heating the internal cabin for the passengers runs counter to the design of the HSD. The HSD is designed to generate as little waste heat as possible. In a conventional car, this waste heat in winter is usually used to heat the internal cabin. In the Prius, running the heater requires the engine to continue running to generate cabin-usable heat. This effect is most noticeable when turning the climate control (heater) off when the car is stopped with the engine running. Normally the HSD control system will shut the engine off as it is not needed, and will not start it again until the generator reaches a maximum speed.
* moderate acceleration: Because hybrid cars can throttle back or completely shut off the engine during moderate, but not rapid, acceleration, they are more sensitive than conventional cars to driving style. Hard acceleration forces the engine into a high-power state while moderate acceleration keeps the engine in a lower power, high efficiency state (augmented by battery boost).
* gradual braking: Regenerative brakes re-use the energy of braking, but cannot absorb energy as fast as conventional brakes. Gradual braking recovers energy for re-use, boosting mileage; hard braking wastes the energy as heat, just as for a conventional car. Use of the &quot;B&quot; (braking) selector on the transmission control is useful on long downhill runs to reduce heat and wear on the conventional brakes, but it does not recover additional energy. Constant use of &quot;B&quot; is discouraged by Toyota as it &quot;may cause decreased fuel economy&quot; compared to driving in &quot;D&quot;.

Most HSD systems have batteries that are sized for maximal boost during a single acceleration from zero to the top speed of the vehicle; if there is more demand, the battery can be completely exhausted, so that this extra torque boost is not available. Then the system reverts to just the power available from the engine. This results in a large decline in performance under certain conditions: an early-model Prius can achieve over on a 6 degree upward slope, but after about of altitude climb the battery is exhausted and the car can achieve only 55–60 mph on the same slope. (until the battery is recharged by driving under less demanding circumstances)

== Prius Platform Generations ==
The design of the Toyota Hybrid System / Hybrid Synergy Drive has now had five generations since the original 1997 Japanese-market Toyota Prius. The power train has the same basic features, but there have been a number of significant refinements.

;Notes
=== Generation 1 (Toyota Hybrid System) ===

The system was called the Toyota Hybrid System (THS) when it was introduced with the Prius in 1997. The hybrid transaxle, designated P110, includes two electric motors (MG1 and MG2) and a planetary gearset, which Toyota calls the &quot;Power Split Device&quot; (PSD); mechanical power from the internal combustion engine (E) can be directed either to the wheels or to MG1, acting as a generator.

Electrical power flows between MG1, MG2, and a storage battery through an inverter. Although MG1 typically operates as a generator (alternator), it also serves as the starter motor for the internal combustion engine. MG2 usually acts as a motor, either by itself at low speeds or to assist the internal combustion engine, but MG2 also can act as a generator, for instance, during deceleration for regenerative braking.

Schematically, MG1 is connected to the central sun gear (S), the internal combustion engine is connected to the planetary gear carrier (P) and not to any individual gear, and MG2 is connected to the ring gear (R). The wheels are connected to the ring gear through appropriate reduction gearing and a differential, not illustrated in the diagram.

The Toyota Hybrid System uses a high-voltage battery pack, ranging between 276 and 288 V. There has been a continuous, gradual improvement in the specific capacity of the traction battery. The original Prius used shrink-wrapped 1.2 volt D cells, and all subsequent THS/HSD vehicles have used custom 7.2 V battery modules mounted in a carrier.

==== G1 single-motor ====

In 2001, a modified version of the Generation 1 THS transaxle was released in the Japanese domestic market as the P210 transaxle, fitted to the Estima minivan. The P210 couples the internal combustion engine (E) with the sun gear (S) and couples the starter/generator (MG1) with the planetary gear carrier (P), which is the opposite of the G1 THS scheme. In addition, the single-motor G1 THS omits the traction motor (MG2) and uses a belt-drive continuously variable transmission which can be selectively coupled via rotating clutches to either the planetary gear carrier (P) or the ring gear (R).

An all-wheel drive option for the Estima was released at the same time; the Q410 rear drive unit uses an electric traction motor with no mechanical coupling to the front transaxle.

=== Generation 2 (Toyota Hybrid System-II) ===
THS was followed by THS-II in the 2004 Prius. Starting with THS-II, Toyota also began referring to the system as Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD). Compared to THS, THS-II offered reduced consumption and better performance with increased power and torque. THS-II uses the same design as THS, combining traction power from an internal combustion engine and an electric motor via a planetary gearset (power split device) which can divert some power to an electrical generator.&lt;ref name=ORNL/TM-2006/423&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrically, HSD/THS-II adds a DC to DC converter boosting the potential of the battery to 500 V or more. This allows smaller battery packs to be used, and more powerful motors. Compared to THS, the physical size of the traction motor (MG2) in THS-II remains approximately the same, but the maximum output has increased from and the maximum torque has increased from . The stator windings are connected in series, which requires a higher potential.

Although not part of the THS/HSD as such, starting with the 2004 Prius, all THS/HSD vehicles have been fitted with an electric air-conditioning compressor, instead of the conventional engine-driven type. This removes the need to continuously run the engine when cabin cooling is required. Two positive temperature coefficient heaters are fitted in the heater core to supplement the heat provided by the engine.

=== Generation 3 (Hybrid Synergy Drive) ===

The updated version of HSD first delivered in the model year 2006 RX 400h is similar to THS/THS-II, with the addition of a second planetary gearset, which Toyota calls the Motor Speed Reduction Device (MSRD); it is compounded with the first planetary gearset (PSD) by coupling the two ring gears (R1 and R2) together. The coupled ring gears are still used to drive the front wheels of the vehicle. The traction motor (MG2) uses the MSRD as a reduction gear, making it possible to increase the power density of the motor. Ford has also developed a similar hybrid system, introduced in the Ford Escape Hybrid.

Toyota CEO Katsuaki Watanabe said in a February 16, 2007 interview that Toyota was &quot;aiming at reducing, by half, both the size and cost of the third-generation HSD system&quot;.
The new system will feature lithium-ion batteries in later years. Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy capacity-to-weight ratio compared to NiMH, but operate at higher temperatures, and are subject to thermal instability if not properly manufactured and controlled, raising safety concerns.

==== G3 all-wheel drive with hybrid transaxle ====
In 2005, vehicles such as the Lexus RX 400h and Toyota Highlander Hybrid added four-wheel drive operation by adding a third electric motor (&quot;MGR&quot;) on the rear axle. In this system, the rear axle is purely electrically powered, and there is no mechanical link between the engine and the rear wheels. This also permits regenerative braking on the rear wheels.

==== G3 rear-wheel drive (Lexus Hybrid Drive) ====

In 2006 and 2007, a further development of the HSD drivetrain, under the Lexus Hybrid Drive name, was fitted to the Lexus GS 450h / LS 600h sedans as the L110 transmission. Previous versions of HSD/THS were fitted to transaxles used with front-wheel drive platforms; Lexus Hybrid Drive applied the two-motor HSD concept to a longitudinal transmission for rear-wheel drive vehicles. This system uses two clutches (or brakes, on R2 and S3) to switch the second motor&#x27;s gear ratio to the wheels between a ratio of 3.9 and 1.9, for low and high speed driving regimes respectively. This decreases the power flowing from MG1 to MG2 (or vice versa) during higher speeds. The electrical path is only about 70% efficient, thus decreasing its power flow while increasing the overall performance of the transmission. The second planetary gearset is extended with a second carrier and sun gear to a ravigneaux-type gear with four shafts, two of which can be held still alternatively by a brake/clutch.

The GS 450h and LS 600h systems utilized rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive drivetrains, respectively, and were designed to be more powerful than non-hybrid versions of the same model lines, while providing comparable engine class efficiency.
A simplified version was released in 2012 with the fourteenth generation Crown (S210); the L210 transmission omits the two clutches but retains the second planetary gearset (MSRD) applied to the output of MG2, in common with other Generation 3 transaxles. However, compared to the G3 transaxles, instead of coupling the two ring gears, the L210 couples the PSD ring gear (R1) to the MSRD planetary gear carrier (P2), and grounds the ring gear of the MSRD (R2) instead of the planetary gear carrier.
===Generation 4===

On October 13, 2015, Toyota announced details of the Fourth Generation Hybrid Synergy Drive which was introduced for the 2016 model year. The overall design returns to a single planetary gearset similar to THS/THS-II; parallel reduction gears on the Fourth Generation transaxles replace the Motor Speed Reduction Device, which is a second planetary gear set found in the Third Generation transaxles. The transaxle and traction motor have been redesigned, delivering a reduction in size and combined weight. The traction motor itself is considerably more compact and gains a better power-to-weight ratio. Notably there is a 20 percent reduction in mechanical losses due to friction compared to the previous model. The 2012– Prius c retains the P510 transaxle. The P610 transaxle employs helical gears rather than the straight-cut spur gears employed in the earlier transaxles, and which run more smoothly and quietly, while also accommodating higher mechanical loads.

==== G4 all-wheel drive with hybrid transaxle ====
With the Fourth Generation HSD, Toyota is also offering a four-wheel drive option, dubbed &quot;E-Four&quot;, similar to the 2005 RX400h and Highlander Hybrid, in which an electric traction motor is added to the rear, but is not mechanically coupled to the internal combustion engine or front inverter. In fact, the &quot;E-Four&quot; system has its own rear inverter, although this inverter draws power from the same hybrid battery as the front inverter. &quot;E-Four&quot; began being offered in Prius models in the United States in the 2019 model year. &quot;E-Four&quot; is an integral part of the RAV4 Hybrid models offered in the United States, and all such RAV4 Hybrids are &quot;E-Four&quot; only.

==== G4 rear-wheel drive (Multistage THS-II) ====

The L310 transmission for rear-wheel drive applications succeeded the prior L110 transmission in premium vehicles. Compared to the L110 and L210, the L310 couples MG2 to the ring gear of the PSD (R1). In addition L310 adds a third planetary gearset, compounded with the second (MSRD) by coupling the planetary gear carrier of the second planetary gearset (P2) with the ring gear of the third planetary gearset (R3), and by coupling the ring gear of the second (R2) with the planetary gear carrier of the third (P3).

In addition, several rotating clutches and brakes have been added, including a one-way clutch on the planetary gear carrier of the second planetary gearset (P2). By selectively engaging these, the transmission can simulate ten different gear ratios.

===Generation 5===
The fifth generation Hybrid Synergy Drive transaxle is similar to the prior generation, with detail improvements making the electric motors lighter, more compact, and more powerful.

==Patent issues==

=== Antonov ===
As of autumn 2005, the Antonov Automotive Technology BV Plc company has sued Toyota, the Lexus brand mother company, over alleged patent infringement relating to key components in the RX 400h&#x27;s drivetrain and the Toyota Prius hybrid compact car. The case has been pending in secret since April 2005, but settlement negotiations did not bring a mutually acceptable result. Antonov eventually took legal recourse in the German court system, where decisions are usually made relatively swiftly. The patent holder seeks to impose a levy on each vehicle sold, which could make the hybrid SUV less competitive. Toyota fought back by seeking to officially invalidate Antonov&#x27;s relevant patents. The court motion in Microsoft Word document format can be read here.

On 1 September 2006 Antonov announced that the Federal Patent Court in Munich has not upheld the validity of the German part of Antonov&#x27;s patent (EP0414782) against Toyota. A few days later, a court in Düsseldorf had ruled that the Toyota Prius driveline and the Lexus RX 400h driveline do not breach the Antonov hybrid CVT patent.

=== Ford ===
Ford Motor Company independently developed a system with key technologies similar to Toyota&#x27;s HSD technology in 2004. As a result, Ford licensed 21 patents from Toyota in exchange for patents relating to emissions technology.

=== Paice ===
Paice LLC received a patent for an improved hybrid vehicle with a controllable torque transfer unit () and has additional patents related to hybrid vehicles. In 2010 Toyota agreed to license Paice&#x27;s patents; terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
In the settlement &quot;The parties agree that, although certain Toyota vehicles have been found to be equivalent to a Paice patent, Toyota invented, designed and developed the Prius and Toyota’s hybrid technology independent of any inventions of Dr. Severinsky and Paice as part of Toyota’s long history of innovation&quot;.
Paice earlier entered into an agreement with Ford for the license of Paice&#x27;s patent.

== Comparison with other hybrids ==
Aisin Seiki Co., minority-owned by Toyota, supplies its versions of the HSD transmission system to Ford for use as the &quot;Powersplit&quot; e-CVT in the Ford Escape hybrid and Ford Fusion Hybrid.

Nissan licensed Toyota&#x27;s HSD for use in the Nissan Altima hybrid, using the same Aisin Seiki T110 transaxle as in the Toyota Camry Hybrid. The 2011 Infiniti M35h uses a different system of one electric motor and two clutches.

In 2010, Toyota and Mazda announced a supply agreement for the hybrid technology used in Toyota&#x27;s Prius model.

General Motors, DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s and BMW&#x27;s Global Hybrid Cooperation is similar in that it combines the power from a single engine and two motors. In 2009, the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry said that &quot;GM is at least one generation behind Toyota on advanced, &#x27;green&#x27; powertrain development&quot;.

In contrast, Honda&#x27;s Integrated Motor Assist uses a more traditional ICE and transmission where the flywheel is replaced with an electric motor, thereby retaining the complexity of a traditional transmission.

==Aftermarket==
Some early non-production plug-in hybrid electric vehicle conversions have been based on the version of HSD found in the 2004 and 2005 model year Prius. Early lead-acid battery conversions by CalCars have demonstrated of ev-only and of double mileage mixed-mode range. A company planning to offer conversions to consumers named EDrive systems will be using Valence Li-ion batteries and have of electric range. Both of these systems leave the existing HSD system mostly unchanged and could be similarly applied to other hybrid powertrain flavors by simply replacing the stock NiMH batteries with a higher capacity battery pack and a charger to refill them for about $0.03 per mile from standard household outlets.

<text>Denis O&#x27;Conor, O&#x27;Conor Don (; 1794–1847) of Clonalis, County Roscommon, was an Irish nobleman, and Member of Parliament (MP) in the British House of Commons.

==Early life and family==
He was born in May 1794 to Owen O&#x27;Conor, O&#x27;Conor Don and his wife Jane Moore daughter of Edward Moore of Mount Browne, County Dublin and Jane Reynolds. Denis was the eldest of four children. He had one brother Edward who became an agent for their father and then to Denis, and two sister Jane and Catherine. He was brought up in Belanagare in County Roscommon until his father moved the family to Clonalis on the death of his fourth cousin once removed, Alexander O&#x27;Conor, O&#x27;Conor Don in 1820 whom his father inherited the title of O&#x27;Conor Don.

The O&#x27;Conors were prominent Catholic gentry who had been the traditional Kings of Connacht and counted among their ancestors two twelfth-century High-Kings of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Mor Ua Conchobair and Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair who was the last high king of Ireland.

On his father&#x27;s side, he was a nephew of Rev. Charles O&#x27;Conor and Matthew O&#x27;Conor. His father&#x27;s first cousin was Thomas O&#x27;Conor and therefore Denis was a second cousin of Thomas&#x27;s son Charles O&#x27;Conor of New York. His great-grandfather was the eminent antiquarian, writer and protagonist for catholic civil rights during the penal laws, Charles O&#x27;Conor of Belanagare. 
His maternal grandfather was a wealthy Catholic brewer in Dublin who was descended from Lewis O&#x27;More youngest brother of Rory O&#x27;More. His maternal grandmother was a daughter of Thomas Reynolds of Rathfarnham and Dundrum Castle. Thomas was a successful Silk manufacturer who descended from a cadet branch of Mac Raghnaill chiefs of Lough Scur in County Leitrim. Through this connection Denis&#x27;s Mother was a first cousin of Thomas Reynolds.

He was educated at St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware, Trinity College, University of Dublin, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and the King&#x27;s Inn to train as a barrister and took the Grand Tour in the early 1820s.

==Career==
In the 1820s, he supported the pro-Catholic agitation in Roscommon led by his father, the O’Conor Don, later that decade and assisted in his return for the county, following the granting of emancipation, in 1830. He moved the resolution for repeal of the legislative Union with Britain at a county meeting, on 14 January 1831, and seconded one in favour of parliamentary reform at another, on the 16 April 1831.

On the death of his father in June 1831, less than a month after he had regained his seat at the general election, he not only succeeded to his ancient title and estates, but, as heir to his father&#x27;s patriotic reputation, was the obvious choice of the county&#x27;s liberal Catholics for the representation.
Denis was elected unopposed to the seat, which he held until his death in 1847. His father had been an emancipationist and O&#x27;Conor continued in this tradition, always voting with Daniel O&#x27;Connell.

O&#x27;Connell wrote to Denis a month after his father&#x27;s death:

The death of my most respected and loved friend, your father, was to me a severe blow ... How little does the world know of the value of the public services of men who like him held themselves always in readiness without ostentation or parade but with firmness and sincerity to aid in the struggles which nations make for liberty ... I really know no one individual to whom the Catholics of Ireland are so powerfully indebted for the successful result of their contest for emancipation ... His was not holiday patriotism ... No, in the worst of times and when the storms of calumny and persecution from our enemies and apathy and treachery from our friends raged at their height he was always found at his post.

He was neither a prominent nor a particularly effective parliamentarian. His rather infrequent interventions were long-winded and pedantic, though always temperate. He was by disposition a conventional Whig rather than a repealer, but family loyalty kept him in O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s camp.

In 1843, he was much drawn to the liberal–unionist alliance of William Smith O&#x27;Brien and Thomas Wyse; he joined with them in obstructing the arms bill at the end of May 1843 and supported O&#x27;Brien a few months later in drawing up his remonstrance against British policy in Ireland, which served as a manifesto for the liberal unionists. However, when O&#x27;Brien was looking for signatures O&#x27;Conor demurred because, in Wyse&#x27;s opinion, he was afraid of what O&#x27;Connell would say. O&#x27;Connell spoke well but blandly of O&#x27;Conor and Charles Wood, joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, termed him ‘a gentleman, not wise but worth attention and civility’.

On 6 July 1846, O&#x27;Conor was appointed Junior Lord of the Treasury in Lord John Russell&#x27;s government; he was one of five Irish MPs who obtained junior ministerial posts as a result of the Irish party&#x27;s alliance with the whigs.

==Personal life==
On 27 August 1824, he married his first cousin once removed Mary Blake (died 1841), daughter of Major Maurice Blake, of Towerhill house, in County Mayo, and Maria O&#x27;Connor, daughter of the wealthy catholic merchant Valentine O&#x27;Connor, from a cadet branch of the O&#x27;Conor Sligo who had settled in Galway and Mary Moore. Mary&#x27;s father was from a cadet branch of the Blake baronets of Menlough through a younger son of Sir Valentine Blake, 3rd Baronet. They had seven children:

* Jane O&#x27;Conor. A Catholic nun at Princethorp Convent.
* Kate O&#x27;Conor. A Catholic nun at Princethorp Convent.
* Josephine O&#x27;Conor. A Catholic nun at Princethorp Convent. 
* Eugenia O&#x27;Conor. A Catholic nun at Princethorp Convent.
* Dionysia O&#x27;Conor. A Catholic nun at Princethorp Convent.
* Charles Owen O&#x27;Conor, O&#x27;Conor Don (1838-1906).
* Denis Maurice O&#x27;Conor (1840-1883).

He was a founding member of the Reform Club and a member of Brooks&#x27;s in London as well as being a member of the Stephen&#x27;s Green Club in Dublin.
He died on 22 July 1847. His eldest son Charles Owen succeeded him.

<text>José Desiderio Rodriguez Lima (September 30, 1972 – May 23, 2010) was a Dominican right-handed pitcher who spent 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Detroit Tigers (1994–1996, 2001–2002), Houston Astros (1997–2001), Kansas City Royals (2003, 2005), Los Angeles Dodgers (2004) and New York Mets (2006). His best year in the majors was 1999, when he won 21 games for the Astros and pitched in his only All-Star Game.

His remarkably animated displays of emotion on the mound made him a fan favorite, but also drew the ire of opposing teams. He was known for his flamboyant celebrations after his victories in the face of opponents. Due to his indulging in musical pursuits beyond baseball, he was once described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; sportswriter Ben Shpigel as &quot;the national anthem-crooning, towel-waving merengue singer who moonlights as a right-handed pitcher&quot;.

== MLB career ==
Lima made his Major League debut with the Detroit Tigers on April 20, 1994, at age 21, making a start against the Kansas City Royals. After three years in Detroit, he was traded to the Houston Astros on December 10, 1996, in an eight-player trade. In , he compiled a record of 21–10 and was named to the National League All Star Team that season. However, in 2000, Lima struggled to recapture his success, losing 16 games and recording a league-worst 6.65 earned run average and 48 home runs, the latter of which was only two short of the single season record held by Bert Blyleven.

On June 23, 2001, Lima was traded back to Detroit in exchange for Dave Mlicki. He was released by Detroit during the season, proclaiming at the time, &quot;If I can&#x27;t pitch on this team—the worst or second-worst team in baseball—where am I going to pitch? If I can&#x27;t start on this ballclub, I must be the worst pitcher on Earth.&quot;

Lima pitched for the Newark Bears in the Independent Atlantic League early in 2003, but returned to MLB in June 2003, when he was acquired by the Kansas City Royals. Lima started off fast in Kansas City, compiling a record of 7–0 with a 2.17 ERA after eight starts. A groin injury during his ninth start caused his performance to decline significantly, and he went 1–3 with a 10.65 ERA in his last six starts.

Lima joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in . With the Dodgers, Lima was 13–5 with a 4.07 ERA, his best performance since the 1999 season. Possibly the best moment of his career came on October 9, 2004, in Game Three of the 2004 National League Division Series, when he pitched a five-hit shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals. It was the Dodgers&#x27; first post-season victory since Game Five of the 1988 World Series. In , Lima returned to Kansas City as a free agent but managed only to compile a record of 5–16, while posting a 6.99 ERA and was not re-signed by the club.

On February 14, 2006, Lima was inked to a minor league deal by the Mets and pitched for the Mets&#x27; AAA affiliate, the Norfolk Tides. He was called up to the Mets on May 7, 2006, and went 0–3 with an 8.79 ERA in three starts before being designated for assignment on May 20, 2006. On July 4, 2006, Lima was again recalled by the Mets, when Heath Bell was optioned back to the Norfolk Tides. Lima had another poor outing, on July 7, 2006, against the Florida Marlins, which included surrendering a grand slam to opposing pitcher Dontrelle Willis, and was removed from the game. After the game, Lima was designated for assignment back to the Norfolk Tides for the second time during the 2006 season. Lima finished the 2006 season with a 0–4 record with a 9.87 ERA in four total starts for the Mets. In the Dominican Winter Baseball League, he played for the Águilas Cibaeñas. In , Lima also played for Saraperos de Saltillo in the Mexican League.

== Korea Professional Baseball ==
For the 2008 season, Lima signed with the Kia Tigers, a nine-time champion in the Korea Professional Baseball. Despite high expectations as a former MLB pitcher, Lima struggled in several starts, after which he was sent down to the Korea Baseball Futures League. Many in the media reported that Lima would be released from the Tigers. However, after returning to the Tigers, Lima got two consecutive wins against the Woori Heroes by pitching seven innings while not allowing a single run, and the Hanwha Eagles, pitching five innings and allowing just three runs, but was still released by the Tigers.

== Golden Baseball League ==
Lima signed with the Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball League (GBL) on March 27, 2009. He was to play under veteran minor league manager and former major league all-star Garry Templeton. Lima was traded by the Armada to the Edmonton Capitals for former Chicago White Sox first-round draft pick Kris Honel on July 31, 2009. During a May visit to Edmonton with the Long Beach Armada, Lima was heartily embraced by the Capitals&#x27; fans and even had a local fan club develop at the ballpark—a first ever for a visiting player there. He pitched a total of four games for the Capitals, going 1–2 in the regular season and losing his only GBL playoff appearance.

== Personal life ==
Lima had at least six children with at least six different mothers. He was married twice.

=== Death ===
Lima died on the morning of May 23, 2010, at age 37. He was rushed to Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy did not determine the cause of death, but stated that due to the condition of his heart, he likely died of a cardiac arrhythmia. The autopsy also showed that there were no drugs in his system at the time of his death. Lima suffered from cardiac problems. Lima was buried in Cementerio Las Charcas in Santiago.

On July 12, 2010, David Ortiz paid tribute to his late friend by dedicating his victory in the 2010 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby to Lima.

<text>In quantum mechanics, angular momentum coupling is the procedure of constructing eigenstates of total angular momentum out of eigenstates of separate angular momenta. For instance, the orbit and spin of a single particle can interact through spin–orbit interaction, in which case the complete physical picture must include spin–orbit coupling. Or two charged particles, each with a well-defined angular momentum, may interact by Coulomb forces, in which case coupling of the two one-particle angular momenta to a total angular momentum is a useful step in the solution of the two-particle Schrödinger equation.
In both cases the separate angular momenta are no longer constants of motion, but the sum of the two angular momenta usually still is. Angular momentum coupling in atoms is of importance in atomic spectroscopy. Angular momentum coupling of electron spins is of importance in quantum chemistry. Also in the nuclear shell model angular momentum coupling is ubiquitous.

In astronomy, spin–orbit coupling reflects the general law of conservation of angular momentum, which holds for celestial systems as well. In simple cases, the direction of the angular momentum vector is neglected, and the spin–orbit coupling is the ratio between the frequency with which a planet or other celestial body spins about its own axis to that with which it orbits another body. This is more commonly known as orbital resonance. Often, the underlying physical effects are tidal forces.

==General theory and detailed origin==
===Angular momentum conservation===

Conservation of angular momentum is the principle that the total angular momentum of a system has a constant magnitude and direction if the system is subjected to no external torque. Angular momentum is a property of a physical system that is a constant of motion (also referred to as a &quot;conserved&quot; property, time-independent and well-defined) in two situations:

#The system experiences a spherically symmetric potential field. 
#The system moves (in quantum mechanical sense) in isotropic space.

In both cases the angular momentum operator commutes with the Hamiltonian of the system. By Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty relation this means that the angular momentum and the energy (eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian) can be measured at the same time.

An example of the first situation is an atom whose electrons only experience the Coulomb force of its atomic nucleus. If we ignore the electron–electron interaction (and other small interactions such as spin–orbit coupling), the &quot;orbital angular momentum&quot; of each electron commutes with the total Hamiltonian. In this model the atomic Hamiltonian is a sum of kinetic energies of the electrons and the spherically symmetric electron–nucleus interactions. The individual electron angular momenta commute with this Hamiltonian. That is, they are conserved properties of this approximate model of the atom.

An example of the second situation is a rigid rotor moving in field-free space. A rigid rotor has a well-defined, time-independent, angular momentum.

These two situations originate in classical mechanics. The third kind of conserved angular momentum, associated with spin, does not have a classical counterpart. However, all rules of angular momentum coupling apply to spin as well.

In general the conservation of angular momentum implies full rotational symmetry 
(described by the groups SO(3) and SU(2)) and, conversely, spherical symmetry implies conservation of angular momentum. If two or more physical systems have conserved angular momenta, it can be useful to combine these momenta to a total angular momentum of the combined system—a conserved property of the total system. 
The building of eigenstates of the total conserved angular momentum from the angular momentum eigenstates of the individual subsystems is referred to as &quot;angular momentum coupling&quot;.

Application of angular momentum coupling is useful when there is an interaction between subsystems that, without interaction, would have conserved angular momentum. By the very interaction the spherical symmetry of the subsystems is broken, but the angular momentum of the total system remains a constant of motion. Use of the latter fact is helpful in the solution of the Schrödinger equation.

===Examples===
As an example we consider two electrons, in an atom (say the helium atom) labeled with = 1 and 2. If there is no electron–electron interaction, but only electron–nucleus interaction, then the two electrons can be rotated around the nucleus independently of each other; nothing happens to their energy. The expectation values of both operators, &#x27;1 and &#x27;2, are conserved.
However, if we switch on the electron–electron interaction that depends on the distance (1,2) between the electrons, then only a simultaneous
and equal rotation of the two electrons will leave (1,2) invariant. In such a case the expectation value of neither
&#x27;1 nor &#x27;2 is a constant of motion in general, but the expectation value of the total orbital angular momentum operator &#x27; = &#x27;1 + 2
is. Given the eigenstates of &#x27;1 and &#x27;2, the construction of eigenstates of (which still is conserved) is the &quot;coupling of the angular momenta of electrons&quot; 1 &quot;and&quot; 2.

The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is restricted to integer values and must satisfy the triangular condition that formula_1, such that the three nonnegative integer values could correspond to the three sides of a triangle.

In quantum mechanics, coupling also exists between angular momenta belonging to different Hilbert spaces of a single object, e.g. its spin and its orbital angular momentum. If the spin has half-integer values, such as for an electron, then the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum will also be restricted to half-integer values.

Reiterating slightly differently the above: one expands the quantum states of composed systems (i.e. made of subunits like two hydrogen atoms or two electrons) in basis sets which are made of tensor products of quantum states which in turn describe the subsystems individually. We assume that the states of the subsystems can be chosen as eigenstates of their angular momentum operators (and of their component along any arbitrary axis).

The subsystems are therefore correctly described by a pair of , quantum numbers (see angular momentum for details). When there is interaction among the subsystems, the total Hamiltonian contains terms that do not commute with the angular operators acting on the subsystems only. However, these terms &quot;do&quot; commute with the &quot;total&quot; angular momentum operator. Sometimes one refers to the non-commuting interaction terms in the Hamiltonian as &quot;angular momentum coupling terms&quot;, because they necessitate the angular momentum coupling.

==Spin–orbit coupling==
The behavior of atoms and smaller particles is well described by the theory of quantum mechanics, in which each particle has an intrinsic angular momentum called spin and specific configurations (of e.g. electrons in an atom) are described by a set of quantum numbers. Collections of particles also have angular momenta and corresponding quantum numbers, and under different circumstances the angular momenta of the parts couple in different ways to form the angular momentum of the whole. Angular momentum coupling is a category including some of the ways that subatomic particles can interact with each other.

In atomic physics, spin–orbit coupling, also known as spin-pairing, describes a weak magnetic interaction, or coupling, of the particle spin and the orbital motion of this particle, e.g. the electron spin and its motion around an atomic nucleus. One of its effects is to separate the energy of internal states of the atom, e.g. spin-aligned and spin-antialigned that would otherwise be identical in energy. This interaction is responsible for many of the details of atomic structure.

In solid-state physics, the spin coupling with the orbital motion can lead to splitting of energy bands due to Dresselhaus or Rashba effects.

In the macroscopic world of orbital mechanics, the term &quot;spin–orbit coupling&quot; is sometimes used in the same sense as spin–orbit resonance.

===LS coupling===

In light atoms (generally &quot;Z&quot; ≤ 30), electron spins s&quot;i&quot; interact among themselves so they combine to form a total spin angular momentum S. The same happens with orbital angular momenta ℓ&quot;i&quot;, forming a total orbital angular momentum L. The interaction between the quantum numbers L and S is called Russell–Saunders coupling (after Henry Norris Russell and Frederick Saunders) or LS coupling. Then S and L couple together and form a total angular momentum J:

:formula_2

where L and S are the totals:

: formula_3

This is an approximation which is good as long as any external magnetic fields are weak. In larger magnetic fields, these two momenta decouple, giving rise to a different splitting pattern in the energy levels (the Paschen–Back effect), and the size of LS coupling term becomes small.

For an extensive example on how LS-coupling is practically applied, see the article on term symbols.

===jj coupling===
In heavier atoms the situation is different. In atoms with bigger nuclear charges, spin–orbit interactions are frequently as large as or larger than spin–spin interactions or orbit–orbit interactions. In this situation, each orbital angular momentum ℓ&quot;i&quot; tends to combine with the corresponding individual spin angular momentum s&quot;i&quot;, originating an individual total angular momentum j&quot;i&quot;. These then couple up to form the total angular momentum J
:formula_4 
This description, facilitating calculation of this kind of interaction, is known as &quot;jj coupling&quot;.

==Spin–spin coupling==
Spin–spin coupling is the coupling of the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of different particles.
J-coupling between pairs of nuclear spins is an important feature of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as it can
provide detailed information about the structure and conformation of molecules. Spin–spin coupling between nuclear spin and electronic spin is responsible for hyperfine structure in atomic spectra.

== Term symbols ==
Term symbols are used to represent the states and spectral transitions of atoms, they are found from coupling of angular momenta mentioned above. When the state of an atom has been specified with a term symbol, the allowed transitions can be found through selection rules by considering which transitions would conserve angular momentum. A photon has spin 1, and when there is a transition with emission or absorption of a photon the atom will need to change state to conserve angular momentum. The term symbol selection rules are:  = 0;  = 0, ±1;  = ± 1;  = 0, ±1 .

The expression &quot;term symbol&quot; is derived from the &quot;term series&quot; associated with the Rydberg states of an atom and their energy levels. In the Rydberg formula the frequency or wave number of the light emitted by a hydrogen-like atom is proportional to the difference between the two terms of a transition. The series known to early spectroscopy were designated &quot;sharp&quot;, &quot;principal&quot;, &quot;diffuse&quot;, and &quot;fundamental&quot; and consequently the letters and were used to represent the orbital angular momentum states of an atom.

== Relativistic effects ==

In very heavy atoms, relativistic shifting of the energies of the electron energy levels accentuates spin–orbit coupling effect. Thus, for example, uranium molecular orbital diagrams must directly incorporate relativistic symbols when considering interactions with other atoms.

== Nuclear coupling ==

In atomic nuclei, the spin–orbit interaction is much stronger than for atomic electrons, and is incorporated directly into the nuclear shell model. In addition, unlike atomic–electron term symbols, the lowest energy state is not , but rather, . All nuclear levels whose value (orbital angular momentum) is greater than zero are thus split in the shell model to create states designated by and . Due to the nature of the shell model, which assumes an average potential rather than a central Coulombic potential, the nucleons that go into the and nuclear states are considered degenerate within each orbital (e.g. The 2 contains four nucleons, all of the same energy. Higher in energy is the 2 which contains two equal-energy nucleons).

<doc id="1277838" wikidata="Q41086" url="?curid=1277838" title="Mexican standoff">
<text>A Mexican standoff is a confrontation where no strategy exists that allows any party to achieve victory. Anyone initiating aggression might trigger their own demise. At the same time, the parties are unable to extract themselves from the situation without either negotiating a truce or suffering a loss, maintaining strategic tension until one of those three potential organic outcomes occurs or some outside force intervenes.

The term &quot;Mexican standoff&quot; was originally used in the context of using firearms and it still commonly implies a situation in which the parties face some form of threat from one another; the standoffs can span from someone holding a phone threatening to call the police being held in check by a blackmailer, to global confrontations.

The Mexican standoff as an armed stalemate is a recurring cinematic trope.

== Etymology ==
Sources claim the reference is to the Mexican–American War or post-war Mexican bandits in the 19th century.

The earliest known use of the phrase in print was on 19 March 1876, in a short story about Mexico, featuring the line:
== Popular culture ==
In popular culture, the term &quot;Mexican standoff&quot; references confrontations in which neither opponent appears to have a measurable advantage. Historically, commentators have used the term to reference the Soviet Union – United States nuclear confrontation during the Cold War, specifically the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The key element that makes such situations &quot;Mexican standoffs&quot; is the perceived equality of power exercised amongst the involved parties. The inability of any particular party to advance its position safely is a condition common amongst all standoffs; in a &quot;Mexican standoff&quot;, however, there is an additional disadvantage: no party has a safe way to &quot;withdraw&quot; from its position, thus making the standoff effectively permanent.

The cliché of a Mexican standoff where each party is threatening another with a gun is now considered a movie trope, stemming from its frequent use as a plot device in cinema. A notable example is in Sergio Leone&#x27;s 1966 Western &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, where the characters representing each played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach, face each other in a showdown.

Director John Woo, considered a major influence on the action film genre, is known for his use of Mexican standoffs. Director Quentin Tarantino (who has cited Woo as an influence) has featured Mexican standoff scenes in films including &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (the tavern scene features multiple Mexican standoffs including meta-discussion) and both &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, which depicts a standoff among four characters in the climactic scene.

Writer/Director Francis Galluppi&#x27;s 2023 movie &quot;The Last Stop in Yuma County&quot; features a mexican standoff scene in the diner.

<text>Adefovir is a prescription medicine used to treat (chronic) infections with hepatitis B virus. A prodrug form of adefovir was previously called bis-POM PMEA, with trade names Preveon and Hepsera. It is an orally administered nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (ntRTI). It can be formulated as the pivoxil prodrug adefovir dipivoxil.

==Uses==
It is used for treatment of hepatitis B.

Trials of adefovir in patients with HIV have not shown any clear benefits.

==History==
Adefovir was invented in the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic by Antonín Holý, and the drug was developed by Gilead Sciences for HIV with the brand name Preveon. However, in November 1999, an expert panel advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not to approve the drug due to concerns about the severity and frequency of kidney toxicity when dosed at 60 or 120 mg. The FDA followed that advice, refusing to approve adefovir as a treatment for HIV.

Gilead Sciences discontinued its development for HIV treatment in December 1999, but continued to develop the drug for hepatitis B (HBV), where it is effective with a much lower dose of 10 mg. FDA approval for use in the treatment of hepatitis B was granted on September 20, 2002, and adefovir is sold for this indication under the brand name Hepsera. Adefovir became an approved treatment for HBV in the European Union in March 2003.

==Mechanism of action==

Adefovir works by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial for the HBV to reproduce in the body. It is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with evidence of active viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevations in serum aminotransferases (primarily ALT) or histologically active disease.

The main benefit of adefovir over lamivudine (the first NRTI approved for the treatment of HBV) is that it takes a much longer period of time for the virus to develop resistance to it.

Adefovir dipivoxil contains two pivaloyloxymethyl units, making it a prodrug form of adefovir.

<text>The Northern Fleet (, &quot;Severnyy flot&quot;) is the fleet of the Russian Navy in the Arctic.

According to the Russian ministry of defence: &quot;The Northern Fleet dates its history back to a squadron created in 1733 to protect the territories of the Russian Empire, sea trade routes and fisheries in the White Sea near the coast of the Kola Peninsula. The order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy of 25 May 2014 determined 1733 as the year of foundation of the Northern Fleet, and June 1 as its annual holiday&quot;.

In its modern iteration, the Arctic Ocean Flotilla of the former Imperial Navy evolved into a full fleet of the Soviet Navy in 1933 as the Northern Flotilla. After being awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1965, it was officially known as the Red Banner Northern Fleet. During the Soviet era the Northern Fleet operated more than 200 submarines, ranging from diesel-electric to nuclear-powered ballistic missile classes.

On 1 December 2014 the fleet became the core element of the newly established Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command, including all Russian armed forces located in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Oblasts and on Russia&#x27;s offshore islands along its Arctic coast. It is co-equal in status with Russia&#x27;s Military Districts. The Northern Fleet is tasked with responsibility for operations and defense in the Arctic seas along Northern Russia, including the Barents Sea and Kara Sea, as well as the northwestern maritime approaches to Russia including the Norwegian Sea and Atlantic Ocean.

The Northern Fleet&#x27;s headquarters and main base are located in Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast, with secondary bases elsewhere in the greater Kola Bay area. The current commander is Vice-Admiral , who was appointed to the position in April 2024. In June 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an executive order making the Northern Fleet an independent military-administrative entity, effective January 1, 2021. That status was abolished on February 26, 2024 by a new presidential decree (effective since March 1, 2024) and fleet became part of the recreated Leningrad Military District.

==History==
===Arctic Sea Flotilla and White Sea Flotilla===
On June 19, 1916, the Imperial Russian Navy formed the Arctic Ocean Flotilla (&quot;Флотилия Северного Ледовитого океана&quot;, or &quot;Flotiliya Severnogo Ledovitogo okeana&quot;) during World War I to safeguard transportation routes of Allied ships through the Barents Sea from the Kaiserliche Marine of the German Empire. After the October Revolution and the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Soviet Navy replaced the Imperial Russian Navy and formed the White Sea Flotilla (&quot;Беломорская флотилия&quot;, &quot;Belomorskaya flotiliya&quot;) in March 1920, based in Arkhangelsk. The White Sea Flotilla replaced the Arctic Sea Flotilla and was renamed as the Naval Forces of the North Sea, but was later disbanded in January 1923.

===Soviet Navy===
====Northern Flotilla====
The Northern Flotilla was formed on August 5, 1933, by transferring patrol boats &quot;Smerch&quot; and &quot;Uragan&quot;, D-class submarines &quot;Dekabrist&quot; (D-1) and &quot;Narodovolyets&quot; (D-2) and two destroyers from the Baltic Fleet to Northern Russia. These ships departed from Kronstadt on 18 May 1933 and arrived at Murmansk on 5 August. Another destroyer, another patrol boat, another submarine, and two minesweepers joined the flotilla at Soroka in September 1933. Polyarny became the flotilla&#x27;s main base, and a flight of MBR-2 flying boats joined the unit at Murmansk in September 1935.

The Northern Flotilla was quickly expanded in the years after it was formed, receiving new ships, airfields, coastal and air defence artillery. On May 11, 1937, the fleet entered its current form when it was renamed to the Northern Fleet (&quot;Северный флот&quot;, &quot;Severnyy flot&quot;).

====World War II====
The Northern Fleet blocked the Finnish military base at Petsamo through the Winter War of 1939 and 1940. By June 1941, the fleet included 8 destroyers, 15 submarines, 2 torpedo boats, 7 patrol boats, 2 minesweepers, and 116 airplanes.

In August 1940, the Soviets created the White Sea Military Base to defend the coastline, bases, ports, and other installations. The White Sea Flotilla was established in August 1941 under the command of Rear-Admiral M. Dolinin. Subsequent commanders were Vice Admiral Georgy Stepanov (in October), Rear-Admiral Stepan Kucherov, and Vice-Admiral Yuriy Panteleyev.

During the German-Soviet War of 1941 to 1945, the Northern Fleet defended the coastlines of the Rybachy and Sredny peninsulas, secured internal and external transportation routes, and provided support to the maritime flank of the 14th Army. Naval Infantry and up to 10,000 Northern Fleet personnel participated in land warfare including the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation of 1944. Northern Fleet Naval Infantry units caused tens of thousands of German casualties fighting during the Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and North Caucasus campaigns.

Among the air units of the Northern Fleet was the 121st Fighter Aviation Regiment. The Northern Fleet was reinforced with naval aircraft and ships from the Pacific Ocean and Caspian Sea. Great Britain and the United States temporarily provided HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and to the USSR in exchange for the Italian ships captured during the war and destined to be divided among the allies. During the war, the Northern Fleet secured safe passage for 1,463 ships in external convoys and 2,568 ships in internal convoys.

Its submarines, torpedo boats, and aviation sank 192 enemy transport ships and 70 other hostile military ships. The Northern Fleet also damaged a total of 118 transport, military, and auxiliary ships. Soviet submarine &quot;K-21&quot;, under the command of Captain Nikolai Lunin, attacked the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; at 71° 22&#x27; 2&quot;N, 24° 34&#x27; 3&quot;E. The К-21 logbook reports observation of two torpedo explosions, but no damage is reported by German sources.

Ships were lost fighting against unequal odds. Patrol boat &quot;Tuman&quot;, a former trawler, was sunk by three Kriegsmarine destroyers at the entrance to Kola Bay on August 4, 1941. The icebreaker &quot;Sibiryakov&quot; was sunk on August 25, 1942 by the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; while defending two convoys. The patrol ship &quot;Brilliant&quot; (formerly trawler &quot;Murmany&quot;) was sunk by a submarine.

The Northern Fleet received the following awards:

* Two airborne regiments, a squadron of submarine hunters, eight submarines, and the destroyer &quot;Гремящий&quot; (&quot;Gremyaschiy&quot;, or &quot;Rattler&quot;) were awarded &quot;Soviet Guards&quot; status.
* Many formations, units, and ships were awarded with Order honors.
* Eighty-five sailors of the Northern Fleet received the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union (with three of them receiving the award twice).
* More than a total of 48,000 men were awarded medals.

====Cold War====
The White Sea Flotilla was reestablished under the fleet in December 1945 and the White Sea Naval Base in December 1956.

The Northern Fleet was considered secondary to the Baltic and Black sea fleets until operational responsibility for the Atlantic Ocean was shifted in the 1950s because of more direct access. In September 1955, the Soviet navy became the first to launch a ballistic missile from a submarine. In June 1956, Northern Fleet , (NATO designation Zulu IV 1/2) &quot;“Б-67”&quot; (B-67) became the first to carry ballistic missiles.

The 2nd Cruiser Division was formed on 31 May 1956 at Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast. Its ships included the s (Project 68) , &quot;Aleksandr Nevskiy&quot;, and &quot;Molotovsk&quot;, and the 121st Destroyer Brigade, with 11 , , and destroyers. On 5 June 1969, the division was reorganised with the 170th Destroyer Brigade (8 Project 56 destroyers) and the 10th Anti-Submarine Warfare Brigade (10 Project 42 and 50 ASW vessels). On 1 April 1961, the division was renamed the 2nd Anti-Submarine Warfare Division.

On 1 July 1958, the Northern Fleet raised the Soviet Navy ensign over the first Soviet nuclear submarine, K-3 Leninskiy Komsomol. Following the 1958 voyage of USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the &quot;Leninskiy Komsomol&quot; (named for Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Komsomol) traveled under the Arctic ice and surfaced at the North Pole on 17 July 1962. Russian submarines have visited the North Pole region more than 300 times since then. Two nuclear submarines of the Northern Fleet made a journey under the Arctic ice cap and reached the Pacific Fleet for the first time in history in September 1963.

More than 25 Soviet submarines did the same in the following years. The Northern Fleet was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 7 May 1965. Two Northern Fleet submarines made a journey &quot;around the world&quot; (actually only between the Kola Gulf and the base at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy around South America) without surfacing in 1966. The Northern Fleet had almost 50% of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s submarines by 1986.

From 1968 to 30 November 2005, the was the main Atlantic operational force of the fleet. The Museum of the Air Forces of the Northern Fleet was opened on 20 August 1976, in the closed settlement of Safonovo, Murmansk Oblast. Aircraft carriers began entering service with the Fleet in the 1970s. The lead unit of the Kiev class of heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers, , became operational in 1977, and was commissioned in 1987. Large nuclear-powered missile-carrying cruisers, the and , also entered service from 1980. Fortification of the southern reaches of the Barents Sea during the 1980s marked a Soviet naval strategy shift to an emphasis on bastion defense. Russia has continued to employ that strategy.

In 1982, the 175th independent Naval Infantry Brigade was formed at Tumannyy, in Murmansk Oblast.

In 1990, the 88th Separate Fighter Bomber Regiment, along with the rest of the 36th Air Army, was pulled out of Hungary along with the rest of the Southern Group of Forces. In order to save the unit, which had a distinguished history, from being disbanded under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, defence minister Marshal Dmitry Yazov transferred it to the Northern Fleet, which was not subject to the provisions of the treaty. In May 1990 the aircraft and personnel were moved to Olen&#x27;ya Airbase, near Olenegorsk, Murmansk Oblast where they operated in support of the Soviet Navy.

In May 1994, after the Russian Ministry of Defence had ordered the retirement of the MiG-23/27 family, the unit was re-equipped with the Sukhoi Su-25 and its aircraft were allowed to deteriorate, being stripped for scrap by the locals. It was then renamed the 88th Independent Shipboard Attack Air Regiment.

===Russian Navy===

An analysis of the Northern Fleet produced by Chatham House in the UK notes that: &quot;After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin paid little attention to the Arctic. During the 1990s, the Russian Arctic was at best considered a burden fraught with socio-economic problems. Little was done there until an ‘Arctic revival’ began in the 2000s, focused on reinvesting in a region that had previously been abandoned for more than 15 years&quot;.

Units were disbanded in the 1990s including the 6th and 3rd Submarine divisions in addition to aviation units. Previous units also included the 1st Submarine Flotilla, and the 7th Submarine Division of nuclear attack submarines. In 1989 the Soviet Navy had nearly 200 nuclear submarines in operation of which two-thirds were said to belong to the Northern Fleet. By 1996, only half were still in service.

The 57th Naval Missile Aviation Division of Tu-22s and electronic warfare Tu-16s from the Baltic Fleet at Bykhov, Mogilev Oblast, in the Byelorussian SSR transferred to the Northern Fleet in December 1991 as the 57th Combined Ship Aviation Division. The division commanded the 830th and 38th Shipborne Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiments and the 279th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment from Severomorsk-3 in Murmansk Oblast until disbanded on 1 May 1998.

The 5th Naval Missile Aviation Division commanding the 524th and 574th Naval Missile Aviation Regiments. The 574th Regiment was based at Lakhta air base (Katunino), until disbanded in 2002. The 100th Independent Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment (in February 1993) and its personnel and equipment absorbed by the 279th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment.

On 12 August 2000, the &quot;Kursk&quot; submarine disaster gained international attention when the &quot;Kursk&quot; of the Northern Fleet perished in a torpedo accident during exercises in the Barents Sea near Murmansk Oblast, resulting in the deaths of 118 sailors.

Beginning in the early 2000s, however, a renewed emphasis was placed on modernizing the Russian Navy, including the Northern Fleet. As argued in the Chatham House analysis: &quot;Moscow&#x27;s intentions for the Arctic are not Arctic-specific, but are related to the Kremlin&#x27;s global ambitions for reviving Russia as a great power. Russia&#x27;s force posture in the Arctic is informed by the changing geopolitical environment around its strained relations with the West&quot;.

The importance attached to the Northern Fleet is illustrated by the fact that it constitutes its own district command within the Russian Armed Forces equal to the Armed Forces&#x27; other military districts. In January 2016, Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced that the 45th Air Force and Air Defence Army had been formed under control of the Northern Fleet in December 2015. Its territorial control center assumed combat duty in July 2018. Today both the 45th Air Force and Air Defence Army, as well as the 14th Army Corps, fall under the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command, which was established in 2014 and is a military-administered district of equal status to the other four military districts of the Russian Armed Forces. Its jurisdiction is primarily within the northern region of European Russia and the Arctic Ocean. The formal status of the Northern Fleet as a command equal to that of other Russian military districts took effect on January 1, 2021.

The Northern Fleet includes about two-thirds of all the Russian Navy&#x27;s nuclear-powered ships. The flagship &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot; is named after &quot;Peter the Great&quot;. The Fleet staged a series of major Barents Sea exercises in January 2004 involving thirteen ships and seven submarines including &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot;, &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot;, with President Vladimir Putin was aboard the Typhoon class ballistic missile submarine &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot;. The exercise was marred by two RSM-54 SLBM launch failures aboard &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot; and &quot;Kareliya&quot;.

Submarines have traditionally been the strongest component of the Northern Fleet. Several new classes of submarines are in production to replace older models including: Borei/Dolgorukiy-class SSBNs, Yasen-class SSGNs, Khabarovsk-class SSGNs and Lada-class conventionally-powered submarines. However, the existing nuclear-powered submarines of the Northern Fleet are also aging rapidly. It is currently unclear whether the new Yasen-class, and other potential follow-on models, can be produced in sufficient numbers, and on a timely basis, to replace aging older nuclear submarines on a one-for-one basis. In this regard, reports suggest that Russian third-generation nuclear submarines have not been modernized to a level to avoid block obsolescence before 2030.

The Northern Fleet has also received attention with respect to technological upgrades. The Fleet has received new combat aircraft (deployed within the 45th Air and Air Defence Army), enhanced shore-based missile assets (both surface-to-surface and surface-to-air) as well as new systems such as the Samarkand electronic warfare systems in 2017 and the Barnaul-T air reconnaissance system in December 2021. Samarkand is designed to assess electromagnetic situation, search, detect and analyze radio emissions and Barnaul-T helps conduct reconnaissance round-the-clock. Russia&#x27;s Northern Fleet in 2018 resumed regular air patrols of the Arctic by long-range anti-submarine aircraft and its share of modern samples of weapons and equipment exceeded 56 percent. An air defense regiment of the Northern fleet armed with S-400 SAM launchers went on combat duty in Novaya Zemlya in the September 2019.

Ground force modernization has also been a priority focus through the creation of the 14th Army Corps within the fleet and broader equipment modernization. A tank battalion of a Northern Fleet&#x27;s separate motorized infantry brigade received the final batch of 26 T-80BVM tanks and completed the rearmament procedure in November 2019. The 76th Guards Air Assault Division and the 98th Guards Airborne Division, strategic reserve formations from the Russian Airborne Forces, might be deployed to help protect the Kola Peninsula, in certain circumstances.

While the Northern Fleet has traditionally emphasized the deployment of larger warships and submarines, new missile boats (of the Buyan/M and Karakurt classes) have temporarily been able to deploy into Northern Fleet waters utilizing Russian internal waterways. In 2020, the Buyan-M class corvette &quot;Zelenyy Dol&quot; and the Karakurt-class corvette &quot;Odintsovo&quot; trained and conducted trials in Arctic waters having deployed to northern waters via the internal waterways. The deployment illustrated the Russian capacity to reinforce the Northern Fleet with cruise missile-armed light units, potentially drawn from the Russian Navy&#x27;s two other western fleets or from the Caspian Flotilla. In 2021, the Karakurt-class corvette &quot;Sovetsk&quot; also made the transit from the Baltic to the White Sea for missile exercises.

In late 2021 it was reported that the Russian Navy was considering the possible creation of a new fleet, termed the &quot;Arctic Fleet&quot;, which would be oriented to employing &quot;ships and special equipment suitable for the Arctic&quot;. The Northern and Pacific fleets would continue to focus on &quot;combat missions&quot;. If established, it was envisaged that the &quot;Arctic Fleet&quot; would maintain infrastructure separate from the Northern and Pacific fleets.

==Sites==
The Northern Fleet&#x27;s main base is Severomorsk. There are six more naval bases at Polyarnyy, Olenya Bay, Gadzhiyevo (Yagelnaya/Sayda), Vidyayevo (Ura Bay and Ara Bay), Bolshaya Lopatka (Litsa Guba), and Gremikha. Civilian &quot;Arktika&quot; nuclear-powered icebreakers are based at Murmansk. Shipyards are located in Murmansk, Severodvinsk, Roslyakovo, Polyarnyy, Nerpa, and Malaya Lopatka. Spent fuel storage sites include Murmansk, Gremikha, Severodvinsk and Andreyeva Bay.

==HQ Band==

The Military Band of the Northern Fleet () is a military band unit of the Russian Armed Forces that is a branch of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia. It is based at the fleet HQ in Severomorsk. The band also takes part in national events and holidays in Russia such as the Victory Day and Defender of the Fatherland Day holidays as well as the Navy Day fleet parade. It has taken part in the ceremonial arrival of ships to the Northern Fleet Headquarters including the &quot;Vice-Admiral Kulakov&quot; and the &quot;USS Nicholas&quot;.

It had taken part in the funerals of many of the victims of the &quot;Kursk&quot; submarine disaster in the fall of 2000. In mid-March 2018, it took part in a competition at the Murmansk Nakhimov Naval School, which was presided by Colonel Timofey Mayakin, the Senior Director of Music of the Russian Armed Forces. In September of that year, the band as well as a band from Tromsø, Norway, where they performed &quot;Norwegian March&quot; and &quot;Farewell of Slavianka&quot; at the Murmansk Regional Philharmonic.

==Order of battle==
From January 1, 2021 the Northern Fleet command was made a separate command within the Russian Armed Forces having equal status to the other Russian military districts. As such, it consists of naval forces (the Northern Fleet itself), land forces (14th Army Corps, plus naval infantry and coastal defence troops), as well as aviation and air defence assets (45th Air Force and Air Defence Army). That status was abolished on February 26, 2024 by a new presidential decree (effective since March 1, 2024) which transferred the Northern Fleet to the re-formed Leningrad Military District.

Additional capability in Arctic waters is provided by civilian icebreakers operated by the state-owned Rosatom company as well as other companies (Rosmorport, Gazprom Neft) and a Project 21180 vessel built for the Russian Navy. This icebreaker fleet, which includes seven nuclear-powered vessels operated by Rosatom, has been described as &quot;crucial to military access and operations&quot;. Additional nuclear-powered Project 22220 (three in service, two more building and two additional ships planned as of early 2023) and Project 10510 (one vessel building) icebreakers have entered service, or are under construction/planned, to augment and replace those in service.

The Navy, in turn, is procuring a new &quot;lightened&quot; class of Project 21180M icebreakers (which are two-thirds the displacement of the existing Project 21180 ship) with the first vessel being deployed with the Pacific Fleet in early 2023. These plans were formalized under the terms of a presidential executive order and Arctic strategy unveiled in October 2020. The icebreakers are designed to ensure the capacity of year-round navigation along the Northern Sea Route.

The Russian Coast Guard provides additional armed patrol vessels in Arctic waters with a further expansion of its capabilities anticipated in the 2020s.

As of early 2023, the Northern Fleet itself comprises about 32 surface warships (including major surface combatants, light corvettes, mine counter-measures vessels and amphibious units), though some units are under repair or otherwise not operational. Additional lighter patrol units, support ships and auxiliaries are also deployed. The Fleet also comprises around 33+ submarines (including ballistic missile submarines, cruise missile submarines, special purpose submarines as well as nuclear and conventional attack submarines). As with the surface fleet, some submarines are not operational; others are in reserve and inactive. Nevertheless, programs to modernize the Russian Navy are continuing with the Northern Fleet traditionally having a priority focus with respect to major combatants.

As of early 2024, the Northern Fleet has formed several new units.

<text>A stacker is a large machine used in bulk material handling. Its function is to pile bulk material such as limestone, ores, coal and cereals onto a stockpile. A reclaimer can be used to recover the material.

Gold dredges in Alaska had a stacker that was a fixed part of the dredge. It carried over-size material to the tailings pile.

Stackers are nominally rated for capacity in t/h []. They normally travel on a rail between stockpiles in the stockyard. A stacker can usually move in at least two directions: horizontally along the rail and vertically by luffing (raising and lowering) its boom. Luffing of the boom minimises dust by reducing the distance that material such as coal needs to fall to the top of the stockpile. The boom is luffed upwards as the height of the stockpile increases. Some stackers can rotate the boom. This allows a single stacker to form two stockpiles, one on either side of the conveyor.

Stackers are used to stack in different patterns, such as cone stacking and chevron stacking. Stacking in a single cone tends to cause size segregation, with coarser material moving out towards the base. In raw cone ply stacking, additional cones are added next to the first cone. In chevron stacking, the stacker travels along the length of the stockpile adding layer upon layer of material.

Stackers and reclaimers were originally manually controlled, with no means of remote control. Modern machines are typically semi-automatic or fully automated, with parameters remotely set. The control system used is typically a programmable logic controller, with a human-machine interface for display, connected to a central control system.

Other than stacking, a stacker has three basic movements:
* Luffing: This is vertical movement. Stackers use either a winch mechanism with metal wire, or hydraulic cylinders, generally two. Winch mechanisms are highly reliable compared to hydraulic actuators and remain widely used, particularly in large stackers.
* Travelling: The stacker moves on a rail track, which may be broad or narrow gauge, enabling it to move around the stockyard as required. For this purpose, traction motors powered by direct current (DC) are connected by bevel gears to between 12 and 22 wheels. For manual control, all the controls are in a controller&#x27;s cabin above the boom conveyor or boom. Modern stackers can be controlled remotely.
* Slewing: This is rotation of the stacker around its central axis to align or place the stockpile where required. This works mostly by a slew pinion that rotates around a slew base. This type of gear assembly is called a sun and planet gear. The axles may be multiple and are driven by DC-powered axle motors which transmit the torque via bevel or helical gears.

The conveyor belts used in stackers may be made of fabric or metal wire, depending upon the material to be handled. They are driven by pulleys, which in turn are driven by DC motors. The motors and gear are coupled by fluid coupling.

Most stackers are electrically powered by way of a trailing cable. There are basically two types of cable trailing: power cord rotating drum (PCRD) and control cable rotating drum (CCRD). Pendulum adjustments are made to ensure the proper alignment of these cables while the stacker is travelling.

<text>Elizabeth Rogers (born Betty Jayne Rogers, May 18, 1934 – November 6, 2004) was an American actress.

==Life and career==

Born in Austin, Texas, she played minor characters in thirty-seven episodes of a dozen different prime-time network series, including &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Dragnet 1966&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Dragnet 1967&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Slattery&#x27;s People&quot;.

In the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series, she portrayed Lt. Palmer, a substitute communications officer, in two episodes: &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Way to Eden&quot; (1969). For &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot;, Rogers was brought in at the last minute after Nichelle Nichols (the series regular as communications officer Lt. Uhura) informed the producers that she was flying to New York for a concert performance. As Nichols had no standard contract she was legally free to do so, but Rogers&#x27; appearance was intended to convince her to keep herself available for &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Rogers said in a later interview, &quot;I got the part when Uhura [Nichols] had a singing engagement. I was used as an instant &#x27;threat&#x27; replacement.&quot;

During the 1970s, she also appeared in a string of Irwin Allen produced films including &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). She was a personal friend of Allen and his wife, Sheila Matthews Allen, and was married to actor Erik Nelson (also a regular in Irwin Allen films) in the backyard of Allen&#x27;s home. Her other film appearances included &quot;Bittersweet Love&quot; (1976), &quot;The Van&quot; (1977), &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; (1977), and &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982) as David Keith&#x27;s mother.

==Death==
She died from multiple strokes and lung cancer on November 6, 2004, in Tarzana, California at the age of 70.

<doc id="1277877" wikidata="Q827033" url="?curid=1277877" title="Berounka">
<text>The Berounka () is a river in the Czech Republic, a left tributary of the Vltava River. It flows through the Plzeň and Central Bohemian regions to Prague. It is formed by the confluence of the Mže and Radbuza rivers in Plzeň. Together with the Mže, which is its main source, the Berounka is long, which makes it the fifth longest river in the Czech Republic. Without the Mže, it is long.

==Etymology==
The river is named after the town of Beroun. Originally, the entire stream was called Mže () and the name first appeared in the 12th century, among others in &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot;. The name was written as &quot;Mse&quot;, &quot;Msa&quot; and &quot;Misa&quot;. From the 17th century, the lower course started to be named Berounka, but the name Mže still appeared as a name for the entire stream at the end of the 19th century. In order to avoid confusion, an initiative to rename the lower course back to the historical name Mže was created in 2008, but its efforts were unsuccessful due to the strongly adopted current name.

==Characteristic==

From a water management point of view, the Berounka and Mže are two different rivers with separate numbering of river kilometres. In a broader point of view, the Berounka (as Mže) originates in the territory of Mähring in the Upper Palatine Forest at an elevation of and flows to Prague-Lahovice, where it enters the Vltava River at an elevation of . It is long, of which is in Germany. In the Czech Republic, it is long, which makes it the fifth longest river in the country. Its drainage basin has an area of . The name Berounka is used from the confluence of the Mže with the Radbuza in Plzeň and from this point to the confluence with the Vltava, the river is long.

The Berounka has many significant tributaries. The sources and longest tributaries of the Berounka are:
==Settlements==

There are several large settlements on the river. The Mže flows through Tachov and Stříbro. After its confluence with the Radbuza in Plzeň, the Berounka flows through Beroun, Řevnice, Dobřichovice, Černošice and along the edge of Prague.

==Bodies of water==
There are 7,502 bodies of water in the basin area; the largest of them is the Hracholusky Reservoir with an area of , built at the confluence of the Mže and the stream Úterský potok. There are no bodies of water built directly on the lower course of the Berounka.

==Fauna==
The river is home to the mollusc &quot;Unio pictorum&quot;, which is critically endangered within the Czech Republic. The endemic species &quot;Bulgarica nitidosa&quot; lives by the river.

==Use==
There is an artificial slalom course in Roztoky, on the 63rd river km.

==Tourism==
The Berounka is considered one of the most beautiful rivers in the country and is among the most popular rivers for river tourism. Almost its entire flow from Plzeň is navigable. It is popular thanks to the sections in the protected landscape areas of Křivoklátsko and Český kras, which lead through unspoiled nature. The Berounka belongs to the undemanding rivers suitable for beginner paddlers. An 82 km long educational trail for paddlers runs along the river.

<doc id="1277879" wikidata="Q2121702" url="?curid=1277879" title="River Ystwyth">
<text>The River Ystwyth (; ; ) is a river in Ceredigion, Wales. The length of the main river is . Its catchment area covers . Its source is a number of streams that include the Afon Diliw, located on the west slopes of Plynlimon on the border of Ceredigion and Powys in the Cambrian Mountains. The Ystwyth flows westwards before its confluence with the Afon Rheidol and the estuary at Aberystwyth to drain into Cardigan Bay.

The Ystwyth valley is sparsely populated with villages, namely Ysbyty Ystwyth, Cwm Ystwyth, Pont-rhyd-y-groes, Llanilar and Llanfarian. In previous centuries, the valley was relatively densely populated due to its mineral wealth. Silver, lead and zinc have been mined in the valley since Roman times, an activity that reached its peak in the 18th century. The largest of the very many mines was Cwm Ystwyth Mine. It is reputed that the average age at death of the miners in Cwm Ystwyth was 32, largely because of acute lead poisoning. There is no active metal mining in the Ystwyth valley today.

Hafod Uchtryd was a mansion built by Thomas Johnes from 1783, part of it being designed by John Nash. The landscaped gardens were formed by blasting away parts of hills to create vistas. Roadways and bridges were built, and hundreds of thousands of trees were planted. The result was a landscape that became famous and attracted many visitors, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and it is believed to have inspired a passage in his poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. The house was demolished in 1955, but the landscape remains today.

The River still carries elevated levels of lead, zinc, and silver in its water, mostly due to seepage from abandoned mine tailings and discharges from mine adits. At the Frongoch mine near Pont-rhyd-y-groes, Natural Resources Wales has introduced a new technique for reducing the pollution. Water is drawn away from the mine in a leat to a wetland area, where biological processes involving the vegetation immobilise much of the pollutants. A similar approach is being used at Cwm Rheidol mine, near Aberystwyth. These remedies are considered important because the area supports a rich variety of wildlife, as well as bringing anglers and tourists to the area.

<doc id="1277883" wikidata="Q630397" url="?curid=1277883" title="Sabarmati River">
<text>The Sabarmati River is one of the major west-flowing rivers in India. It originates in the Aravalli Range of the Udaipur District of Rajasthan and meets the Gulf of Khambhat of Arabian Sea after travelling in a south-westerly direction across Rajasthan and Gujarat. of the river length is in Rajasthan, while is in Gujarat.

== Course ==
The Sabarmati River originates in the Aravalli Range in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The total length of the river is . After travelling in Rajasthan it flows into the Indian state of Gujarat where it is joined by a left bank tributary, Wakal, near the village Ghonpankhari. From there, the river continues southwest to Mhauri and meets a right bank tributary, the Sei River. Continuing its journey, it is joined by a left bank tributary, the Harnav River, before entering the Dharoi reservoir. After the Sabarmati passes the Dharoi dam it meets another left bank tributary, the Hathmati River. From there, the river flows past the city of Ahmedabad and is joined by a left bank tributary, the Watrak River. The Sabarmati River continues to flow and drains into the Gulf of Khambhat, in the Arabian Sea.

==Basin==
The catchment area of the Sabarmati basin is out of which lies in Rajasthan State and the remaining in Gujarat. The basin is located in a semi-arid zone with rainfall ranging from in different parts of the basin. The river traverses three geomorphic zones: rocky uplands, middle alluvial plains, and lower estuarine zone.

The major tributaries are the Watrak, Wakal, Hathmati, Harnav, and Sei rivers. Average annual water availability in the Sabarmati basin is per capita, which is significantly lower than the national average of per capita.

The Sabarmati is a seasonal river whose flows are dominated by the monsoon, with little or no flows post-monsoon. An average flow of per second was measured at Ahmedabad during the period 1968–1979. Over the past century, the flood of August 1973 is considered to be the largest flood, when a flow of per second was measured at Dharoi.

== Significance in Hinduism ==
In Rajasthan, it is believed that the Sabarmati River originated due to the penance of ascetic Kashyapa on Mount Abu. His penance had pleased Shiva and in return, Shiva gave ascetic Kashyapa the Ganges River. The Ganges River flowed from Shiva&#x27;s hair onto Mount Abu and became the Sabarmati River. In another legend surrounding the origin of the river, Shiva brought the goddess Ganga to Gujarat and that caused the Sabarmati to come into being.

==History==

Rajashekhara&#x27;s &quot;Kavya-mimamsa&quot; (10th century) calls the river Shvabhravati (IAST: Śvabhravatī). The 11th century text &quot;Shringara-manjari-katha&quot; calls it &quot;Sambhramavati&quot; (literally, &quot;full of fickleness&quot;).

Jain Acharya Buddhisagarsuri has written many poems about the Sabarmati River.

During India&#x27;s independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi established the Sabarmati Ashram as his home on the banks of this river.

In 2018, an assessment by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) named the Kheroj-Vautha stretch of the Sabarmati among the most polluted river stretches in India. Ahmedabad civic body&#x27;s failure to build a sewage treatment plant in Motera resulted in further pollution of the river water.

==Dams==
There are several reservoirs on the Sabarmati and its tributaries. The Dharoi dam is located on the main river. The Hathmati, Harnav and Guhai dams are located on the tributaries meeting the main river upstream of Ahmedabad while Meshvo reservoir, Meshvo pick-ueir, Mazam and Watrak dams are located on tributaries meeting downstream. The Kalpasar is planned project in the Gulf of Khambhat.

In 2002, water from the Narmada river was released into the Sabarmati River through the Sardar Sarovar dam.

== Economy ==

=== Sabarmati Riverfront ===
The Sabarmati Riverfront project is one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by the government to enrich the economy. As per the research conducted by couple of academics, the main concern of the riverfront project was to reduce river pollution, increase tourism, and prevent future floods. As of 2020, the second phase of the project has received in-principle approval. KPMG has listed the Sabarmati Riverfront project in its top 100 most innovative global infrastructure projects.

<doc id="1277885" wikidata="Q3288815" url="?curid=1277885" title="Antarctic oscillation">
<text>The Antarctic oscillation (AAO, to distinguish it from the Arctic oscillation or AO), also known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), is a low-frequency mode of atmospheric variability of the southern hemisphere that is defined as a belt of strong westerly winds or low pressure surrounding Antarctica which moves north or south as its mode of variability. 

It is a climate driver for Australia, influencing the country&#x27;s weather conditions – It is associated with storms and cold fronts that move from west to east that bring precipitation to southern Australia.

==Phases and impacts==
Both positive and negative SAM events tends to last for approximately ten days to two weeks, though the timeframe between a positive and a negative event is random. It is usually in the span of a week to a few months, with a negative SAM being more common in the cool months and a positive SAM being more prolonged in the warmer months. Winds associated with the Southern Annular Mode cause oceanic upwelling of warm circumpolar deep water along the Antarctic continental shelf, which has been linked to ice shelf basal melt, representing a possible wind-driven mechanism that could destabilize large portions of the Antarctic ice sheet.

===Positive===
In its positive phase, the westerly wind belt that drives the Antarctic Circumpolar Current intensifies and contracts towards Antarctica. In winter, a positive phase increases rainfall (including East coast lows) in south-eastern Australia (above Victoria) due to higher onshore flows from the Pacific Ocean, decreases rain in the south-west, and decreases snow in the alpine areas. In spring and summer, a positive phase reduces the chance of extreme heat and increases humid onshore flows, therefore making spring and summer wetter than normal. A positive phase would usually occur more frequently with a La Niña event.

===Negative===
Its negative phase involves the belt moving towards the equator, whereby decreasing rainfall in the southeast of Australia in the summer and as well as raising the possibility of spring heatwaves. Moreover, winters will usually be wetter than normal in the south and southwest with more snowfall in the alpine areas, but drier in the east coast due to less moist onshore flows from the east and blockage of cold fronts by the Great Dividing Range, which would act as a rain shadow. This phase will usually be more frequent with an El Niño event.

==Research==
In 2014, Nerilie Abram used a network of temperature-sensitive ice core and tree growth records to reconstruct a 1000-year history of the Southern Annular Mode. This work suggests that the Southern Annular Mode is currently in its most extreme positive phase over at least the last 1000 years, and that recent positive trends in the SAM are attributed to increasing greenhouse gas levels and later stratospheric ozone depletion.

<doc id="1277893" wikidata="Q902806" url="?curid=1277893" title="Thermogravimetric analysis">
<text>Thermogravimetric analysis or thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is a method of thermal analysis in which the mass of a sample is measured over time as the temperature changes. This measurement provides information about physical phenomena, such as phase transitions, absorption, adsorption and desorption; as well as chemical phenomena including chemisorptions, thermal decomposition, and solid-gas reactions (e.g., oxidation or reduction).

==Thermogravimetric analyzer==

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is conducted on an instrument referred to as a thermogravimetric analyzer. A thermogravimetric analyzer continuously measures mass while the temperature of a sample is changed over time. Mass, temperature, and time are considered base measurements in thermogravimetric analysis while many additional measures may be derived from these three base measurements.

A typical thermogravimetric analyzer consists of a precision balance with a sample pan located inside a furnace with a programmable control temperature. The temperature is generally increased at constant rate (or for some applications the temperature is controlled for a constant mass loss) to incur a thermal reaction. The thermal reaction may occur under a variety of atmospheres including: ambient air, vacuum, inert gas, oxidizing/reducing gases, corrosive gases, carburizing gases, vapors of liquids or &quot;self-generated atmosphere&quot;; as well as a variety of pressures including: a high vacuum, high pressure, constant pressure, or a controlled pressure.

The thermogravimetric data collected from a thermal reaction is compiled into a plot of mass or percentage of initial mass on the y axis versus either temperature or time on the x-axis. This plot, which is often smoothed, is referred to as a TGA curve. The first derivative of the TGA curve (the DTG curve) may be plotted to determine inflection points useful for in-depth interpretations as well as differential thermal analysis.

A TGA can be used for materials characterization through analysis of characteristic decomposition patterns. It is an especially useful technique for the study of polymeric materials, including thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, composites, plastic films, fibers, coatings, paints, and fuels.

===Types of TGA===

There are three types of thermogravimetry:

*Isothermal or static thermogravimetry: In this technique, the sample weight is recorded as a function of time at a constant temperature.
*Quasistatic thermogravimetry: In this technique, the sample temperature is raised in sequential steps separated by isothermal intervals, during which the sample mass reaches stability before the start of the next temperature ramp. 
*Dynamic thermogravimetry: In this technique, the sample is heated in an environment whose temperature is changed in a linear manner.

==Applications==

===Thermal stability===

TGA can be used to evaluate the thermal stability of a material. In a desired temperature range, if a species is thermally stable, there will be no observed mass change. Negligible mass loss corresponds to little or no slope in the TGA trace. TGA also gives the upper use temperature of a material. Beyond this temperature the material will begin to degrade.

TGA is used in the analysis of polymers. Polymers usually melt before they decompose, thus TGA is mainly used to investigate the thermal stability of polymers. Most polymers melt or degrade before 200 °C. However, there is a class of thermally stable polymers that are able to withstand temperatures of at least 300 °C in air and 500 °C in inert gases without structural changes or strength loss, which can be analyzed by TGA.


===Oxidation and combustion===

The simplest materials characterization is the residue remaining after a reaction. For example, a combustion reaction could be tested by loading a sample into a thermogravimetric analyzer at normal conditions. The thermogravimetric analyzer would cause ion combustion in the sample by heating it beyond its ignition temperature. The resultant TGA curve plotted with the y-axis as a percentage of initial mass would show the residue at the final point of the curve.

Oxidative mass losses are the most common observable losses in TGA. 

Studying the resistance to oxidation in copper alloys is very important. For example, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is conducting research on advanced copper alloys for their possible use in combustion engines. However, oxidative degradation can occur in these alloys as copper oxides form in atmospheres that are rich in oxygen. Resistance to oxidation is significant because NASA wants to be able to reuse shuttle materials. TGA can be used to study the static oxidation of materials such as these for practical use.

Combustion during TG analysis is identifiable by distinct traces made in the TGA thermograms produced. One interesting example occurs with samples of as-produced unpurified carbon nanotubes that have a large amount of metal catalyst present. Due to combustion, a TGA trace can deviate from the normal form of a well-behaved function. This phenomenon arises from a rapid temperature change. When the weight and temperature are plotted versus time, a dramatic slope change in the first derivative plot is concurrent with the mass loss of the sample and the sudden increase in temperature seen by the thermocouple. The mass loss could result from particles of smoke released from burning caused by inconsistencies in the material itself, beyond the oxidation of carbon due to poorly controlled weight loss.

Different weight losses on the same sample at different points can also be used as a diagnosis of the sample&#x27;s anisotropy. For instance, sampling the top side and the bottom side of a sample with dispersed particles inside can be useful to detect sedimentation, as thermograms will not overlap but will show a gap between them if the particle distribution is different from side to side.

===Thermogravimetric kinetics===

Thermogravimetric kinetics may be explored for insight into the reaction mechanisms of thermal (catalytic or non-catalytic) decomposition involved in the pyrolysis and combustion processes of different materials.

Activation energies of the decomposition process can be calculated using Kissinger method.

Though a constant heating rate is more common, a constant mass loss rate can illuminate specific reaction kinetics. For example, the kinetic parameters of the carbonization of polyvinyl butyral were found using a constant mass loss rate of 0.2 wt %/min.

==Operation in combination with other instruments==

Thermogravimetric analysis is often combined with other processes or used in conjunction with other analytical methods. 

For example, the TGA instrument continuously weighs a sample as it is heated to temperatures of up to 2000 °C for coupling with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and mass spectrometry gas analysis. As the temperature increases, various components of the sample are decomposed and the weight percentage of each resulting mass change can be measured.

<doc id="1277895" wikidata="Q868577" url="?curid=1277895" title="Helen Delich Bentley">
<text>Helen Bentley (née Delich; November 28, 1923 – August 6, 2016) was an American politician who was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Maryland from 1985 to 1995. Before entering politics, she had been a leading maritime reporter and journalist.

== Early life ==
Bentley was born in the copper-mining town of Ruth, Nevada. Her parents were immigrant Serbians, and her father was a miner. When Bentley was eight years old, her father died of silicosis, a common miner&#x27;s disease, and Bentley took a part-time job in a dress shop while her mother took in boarders to support the family.

While at high school, she had her first experiences of journalism and politics while working on the weekly newspaper of Ely, Nevada, which was published by Republican state legislator Charles Russell. She won scholarships to study journalism at the University of Missouri, graduating in 1944 after earning a BA degree with honors. While at college, she worked on the Senate campaign for Democrat James D. Scrugham, and was appointed his Senate secretary.

== Career ==

=== Journalism ===
Following her graduation, Bentley worked for small-town newspapers in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Lewiston, Idaho, but she wanted to report hard news for a larger publication; at the time, most women journalists were limited to writing society news. She wrote to all the main East Coast newspapers and eventually, in 1945, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; offered her a reporting position. She initially reported on labor and union matters, but was subsequently allocated maritime and waterfront news, a significant beat in a city and state whose port contributed heavily to the economy. She became a widely respected maritime reporter, dealing with people from dock workers to state politicians, and also writing for port agencies and shipping companies.

Beginning in 1950, Bentley hosted a local Baltimore TV program on WMAR, &quot;The Port That Built a City&quot;, presenting maritime and transportation-related news. Later retitled &quot;The Port That Built a City and State&quot;, the series was produced by Bentley until 1965 and included then-novel live remotes from the decks of ships in Baltimore harbor during the early years of television.

During the Vietnam War, Bentley became aware of the congestion in the port of Saigon, and traveled there to report on the problems of supplying American troops. President Johnson became aware of her report, and subsequently improvements were made to port facilities in Cam Ranh Bay to relieve pressure on Saigon.

=== Politics ===
In 1969, Bentley was offered a seat on the Federal Maritime Commission. However, she declined and asked for the position of chair instead. She was appointed and chaired the commission from 1969 to 1975. The position made her the highest-ranking woman in President Nixon&#x27;s administration. During her tenure, Bentley advocated for federal support for American shipbuilding yards.

Bentley challenged Democratic incumbent Clarence Long in in 1980 and 1982. She defeated Long on her third attempt in 1984, and was elected to the 99th Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1985, to January 3, 1995.

During her time in office, Bentley was a strong advocate for protectionist trade policies in support of U.S. manufacturing and the U.S. Merchant Marine fleet. She also introduced legislation which enabled the Chesapeake Bay to be dredged, allowing larger cargo ships to access the port of Baltimore. In the 1990s, she was sympathetic towards Serbians during the civil war in Yugoslavia, and opposed U.S. military involvement in that conflict.

Bentley was not a candidate for reelection to the 104th Congress in 1994, but was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination for Governor of Maryland. Despite an endorsement from the incumbent Democratic governor William Donald Schaefer, she was defeated in the Republican primary by the more conservative Ellen Sauerbrey.

When her successor in Congress, Bob Ehrlich, gave up his seat, Bentley sought to take the seat back in 2002. However, the district had been made significantly more Democratic in redistricting and included a large slice of Baltimore City, an area Bentley had never represented. She lost to Baltimore County Executive Dutch Ruppersberger.

In 1995, Bentley founded Helen Bentley &amp; Associates, Inc&quot;.&quot;, and provided consultancy services on international trade, business and government. She was also a consultant for the Maryland Port Administration and the Port of Baltimore, and served on the Board of Trustees for both the Baltimore Museum of Industry and the Maritime Industries Academy High School.

=== Electoral record ===
=== Recognition ===
In 2004, Bentley was inducted into the International Maritime Hall of Fame. In 2006, as part of the Port of Baltimore&#x27;s 300th anniversary celebrations, the port was renamed the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore.

Bentley was a member of the Maryland Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and a recipient of the Speaker&#x27;s Medallion, First Citizen Award, and Governor&#x27;s International Leadership Award from the state government of Maryland.

== Personal life ==
Bentley was married to William Roy Bentley, who died in 2003 from a stroke. The couple had no children. She died at the age of 92, at her home in Timonium, Maryland, from brain cancer.

<doc id="1277898" wikidata="Q369723" url="?curid=1277898" title="Lord Alfred Paget">
<text>Lord Alfred Henry Paget (26 June 1816 – 24 August 1888) was a British soldier, courtier and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1837 and 1865.

==Early life==
Paget was the sixth son of William Paget, the 1st Marquess of Anglesey and the former Hon. Charlotte Cadogan. Among his siblings were Lady Emily Paget (wife of John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney), Lord Clarence Paget, Lady Mary Paget (wife of John Montagu, 7th Earl of Sandwich), Lord George Paget, and Lady Adelaide Paget (wife of Frederick William Cadogan).

From his father&#x27;s first marriage to Lady Caroline Villiers (a daughter of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey and later, Duchess of Argyll), he had several older half-siblings, including Lady Caroline Paget (wife of Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond), Henry Paget, 2nd Marquess of Anglesey, Lady Jane Paget (wife of Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham), Lady Georgina Paget (wife of Edward Crofton, 2nd Baron Crofton), Lady Augusta Paget (wife of Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Templemore), Lord William Paget, Lady Agnes Paget (wife of George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford). From his mother&#x27;s first marriage to Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley, he had four half-siblings, including Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley, William Henry George Wellesley, Hon. Charlotte Wellesley (wife of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury), and Gerald Valerian Wellesley.

==Career==
He became a lieutenant in the Royal Horse Guards. In 1837 he was elected Member of Parliament for Lichfield and held the seat until 1865, when he was defeated by the Conservative Richard Dyott.

Paget was Chief Equerry and Clerk Marshal to the Queen from July 1846 to March 1852, from December 1852 to March 1858, and from June 1859. The office ceased to be a political one from 1866.

He was the Commodore of the Royal Thames Yacht Club, 1846–1873, and Vice-Commodore, 1845-1846 and 1874–1888.

On 1 August 1874, he resigned the Chief Equerryship only. He became a Lieutenant-Colonel (unattached) in 1854.

Paget was a director of the North Staffordshire Railway Company between January 1854 and February 1875.

==Personal life==
In 1847, Paget was married to Cecilia Wyndham (1829–1914), second daughter and co-heiress of George Thomas Wyndham, of Cromer Hall, Norfolk. Their children were:

* Victoria Alexandrina Paget (1848–1859)
* Evelyn Cecilia Paget (1849–1904)
* Sir Arthur Henry Fitzroy Paget (1851–1928), who married American heiress Mary Fiske “Minnie” Stevens In 1878.
* Alfred Wyndham Paget (1852–1918)
* George Thomas Cavendish Paget (1853–1939), raised Paget&#x27;s Horse for service in the Boer War.
* Gerald Cecil Stewart Paget (1854–1913), grandfather of Percy Bernard, 5th Earl of Bandon.
* Violet Mary Paget (1856–1908)
* Sydney Augustus Paget (1857–1916)
* Amy Olivia Paget (1858–1948)
* Alberta Victoria Paget (1859–1945)
* Almeric Hugh Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough (1861–1949), who married Pauline Payne Whitney in 1895. After her death in 1916, he married Edith Starr Miller in 1921.
* Alice Maud Paget (1862–1925)
* Alexandra Harriet Paget (1863–1944), who married Edward Colebrooke, 1st Baron Colebrooke.
* Guinevere Eva Paget (1869–1894)

He lived at 42 Grosvenor Place, London, and at Melford Hall, Sudbury, Suffolk. He died in 1888 unexpectedly, on his yacht off Inverness.

== In popular culture ==
In the television series &quot;Victoria&quot;, Lord Alfred is played by Jordan Waller. In the second series, he was depicted having a same-sex romantic relationship with Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s secretary, Edward Drummond. There is no historical evidence that this took place. In the same series, Lord Alfred marries Lady Wilhelmina Coke (the niece of the Duchess of Buccleuch); but in real life, Lord Alfred married Cecilia Wyndham.

<doc id="1277908" wikidata="Q955343" url="?curid=1277908" title="Morgenblätter">
<text>Morgenblätter (Morning Papers), Op. 279, is a Viennese waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in 1863 and first performed on 12 January 1864 at the Sofiensaal in Vienna.

==Genesis==
The work&#x27;s genesis was attributed to the composition of a waltz by Jacques Offenbach later titled &quot;Abendblätter&quot; when Offenbach dedicated his work to the influential Vienna Authors&#x27; and Journalists&#x27; Association (). The association had earlier intended the &quot;Abendblätter&quot; waltz (untitled by Offenbach when first dedicated) to be played at their Concordia Ball on 12 January 1864.

Strauss and his orchestra were engaged to provide music for the festivity and he was also obliged to dedicate a new composition of his own. Since he was clearly aware of Offenbach&#x27;s dedication, he similarly left it to the association to decide the title of his own work. The committee, in a mood for a musical joust, titled Offenbach&#x27;s work as &quot;Abendblätter&quot; (Evening Papers) and Strauss&#x27; work as &quot;Morgenblätter&quot; (Morning Papers). Friendly rivalry was top of their intentions though as Strauss dutifully premiered Offenbach&#x27;s work as well as his own because the latter was not present on the day in question. Despite many later claims that Strauss&#x27; work was initially ignored, first night press reviews do not proclaim in favor of either work although posterity seemed to pronounce in favor of Strauss&#x27; uplifting work with the &quot;Abendblätter&quot; waltz being equally impressive.

==Music==
The work consists of a brief introduction in followed by a sequence of waltz themes, the first of which is reprised.

===Main theme===


===Description===
&quot;Morgenblätter&quot; is another of Strauss&#x27; more inspired waltzes, during the time where the development of the waltz has been rapid, with varying moods immortalised amongst the 5 two-part sections. The quiet introduction in the key of D major begins the work, with repeated chords in the bass-line. A sharp series of loud chords interrupts the playful mood and a long clarinet passage ushers in the first waltz theme in G major. Waltz 1B (in D major) carries on the exuberant mood before a repeat of waltz 1A quickly proceeds to the tranquility of waltz 2A in C major. Waltz 3A and 3B (F major) is more robust and quicker than the previous sections whereas waltz 4A in B-flat major is quiet and brooding. Waltz 4B erupts in joy for a brief section and proceeding to repeat waltz 4A. Waltz 5A is the climax of the work, in E-flat major and is punctuated with the brass instruments, particularly the trombones. A more peaceful-sounding waltz 5B is played but the brash 5A makes another appearance.

A tense coda would be quickly replaced with a reprise of waltz 2A. A furious passage of chords brought in waltz 1A again before sweeping into a joyous conclusion complete with a snare drumroll and orchestral flourish.

Thomas Hardy&#x27;s poem &quot;A Seaside Town in 1869&quot; (in &quot;Moments of Vision&quot;, 1917) suggests that the waltz was popular in England in the late 1860s.

==Recordings==
*Michael Lanner with his orchestra. Recorded in Berlin on March 20, 1953. It was released by Electrola as catalog number EG 7897.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 34 episode &quot;Bartless&quot;, the waltz is played while Lisa dances in a dream sequence.

<text>The Cape Breton Post is the only daily newspaper published on Cape Breton Island. Founded in Sydney, Nova Scotia, in 1901, it specializes in local coverage of news, events, and sports from communities in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and the counties of Inverness, Richmond and Victoria.

Canwest, after acquiring the Southam Inc. chain in November 2000, which included the &quot;Cape Breton Post&quot;, examined ways to integrate many of its smaller market papers into its Global television news division; however, it wasn&#x27;t to be. On August 10, 2002, Canwest sold eight Atlantic Canada and two Saskatchewan daily newspapers, 34 community papers, and two printing plants to Transcontinental Media including the &quot;Cape Breton Post&quot;, and St. John&#x27;s&quot; The Telegram&quot;. The deal allowed Transcontinental to use its newly acquired Summerside, Prince Edward Island plant to print the Atlantic Canada version of the &quot;National Post&quot;. On April 13, 2017, Transcontinental announced that it had sold all of its newspapers in Atlantic Canada to SaltWire Network, a newly formed parent company of &quot;The Chronicle Herald&quot;.

In March 2024, Saltwire declared bankruptcy. Postmedia Network bought the remains of Saltwire in late summer 2024, including the &quot;Cape Breton Post&quot;. About a month after Postmedia&#x27;s takeover, major layoffs occurred in management, editorial staff, and writers, including cartoonist Michael de Adder which also resulted in local content being replaced by advertisements. The Post&#x27;s building in Sydney was sold in October 2024 as the paper is no longer printed in Sydney, but at the same printing press as the Halifax Chronicle Herald on the mainland.

<doc id="1277918" wikidata="Q218235" url="?curid=1277918" title="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)">
<text>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 2005 musical fantasy film directed by Tim Burton and written by John August, based on the 1964 children&#x27;s novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film stars Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, alongside David Kelly, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, Missi Pyle, James Fox, Deep Roy, and Christopher Lee. The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.

Development for a second adaptation of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; began in 1991, which resulted in Warner Bros. providing the Dahl estate with total artistic control. Prior to Burton&#x27;s involvement, multiple directors and actors were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; represents the first musical film directed by Burton and the first time since &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals.

Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. Rather than using computer-generated environments, Burton primarily used built sets and practical effects, which he claimed was inspired by the book&#x27;s emphasis on texture. Wonka&#x27;s Chocolate Room was constructed on the 007 Stage at Pinewood, complete with a faux chocolate waterfall and river. Squirrels were trained from birth for Veruca Salt&#x27;s elimination from the tour. Actor Deep Roy performed each Oompa-Loompa individually rather than one performance duplicated digitally. Burton shot the film simultaneously alongside the stop-motion animated film &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;, which he also directed.

Willy Wonka-themed chocolate bars were sold, and a Golden Ticket contest was launched as part of the film&#x27;s marketing campaign. Early plans to promote the film with a Broadway theatre musical were not realized. &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; premiered on July 10, 2005, and was released in the United States on July 15 to positive critical reviews, who commended it for its visual appeal and dark tone. It was also a box office success, grossing US$475 million and becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2005. The film received a nomination for Best Costume Design at the 78th Academy Awards, while Depp was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Musical or Comedy. It remains Tim Burton&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film to date.
==Plot==

Charlie Bucket is a kind and loving boy who lives in poverty with his family near the Wonka Factory. The company&#x27;s owner, Willy Wonka, has long closed his factory to the public due to problems concerning industrial espionage, which also caused all his employees, including Charlie&#x27;s Grandpa Joe, to lose their jobs. Charlie&#x27;s father, meanwhile, has more recently been laid off from his own job at a toothpaste factory, although he does not admit this to Charlie.

One day, Wonka announces a contest in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random Wonka Bars worldwide, and the winners will receive a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one will receive an additional prize at the end of the tour. Wonka&#x27;s sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the arrogant, gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, and the ill-tempered Mike Teavee. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in Russia, Charlie finds a banknote and purchases a third Wonka Bar. The Russian ticket is revealed to be a forgery just as Charlie discovers the real ticket inside the wrapper. He receives monetary offers for the ticket, but the cashier warns him not to trade it regardless, and Charlie runs back home. At home, Charlie initially wants to trade the ticket for money for his family&#x27;s betterment, but after a pep talk from Grandpa George, he decides to keep it, and brings Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the tour.

Charlie and the other ticket holders are greeted outside the factory by Wonka, who then leads them into the facility. Individual character flaws cause the other four children to give in to temptation, resulting in their elimination from the tour while Wonka&#x27;s new employees, the Oompa-Loompas, sing a song of morality after each. Meanwhile, Wonka reminisces on his troubled past and how his dentist father, Wilbur, strictly forbade him from consuming any candy. After sneaking a piece of candy, Wonka instantly became hooked and ran away from home to follow his dreams. When he returned, however, both his father and their house were gone.

After the tour, the four eliminated children leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their elimination, while Charlie learns that Wonka, now approaching retirement, intended to find a worthy heir. Since Charlie was the least ill-behaved of the five, Wonka invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, provided that he leave his family behind. Charlie declines, as his family is the most important thing in his life.

As Charlie and his family&#x27;s life improve, Wonka becomes despondent, causing his company and sales to decline. He eventually turns to Charlie for advice, and he decides to help Wonka reconcile with his estranged father, Wilbur. During the reunion, Charlie notices newspaper clippings of Wonka&#x27;s success which Wilbur collected, while Wonka realizes the value of family as he and Wilbur finally reconcile. Afterwards, Wonka allows Charlie and his family to move into the factory together.

==Production==
===Development===
Author Roald Dahl disapproved of the 1971 film adaptation. Warner Bros. Pictures and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered into discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl&#x27;s widow, Felicity (&quot;Liccy&quot;), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl estate&#x27;s subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; had languished in development hell since the 1990s.

Ang Lee, Terry Gilliam, Anthony Minghella, and Spike Jonze were among the Dahl estate&#x27;s preferred directors for the project. Scott Frank was hired to write the screenplay in February 1999, after approaching Warner Bros. for the job. Frank, a recent Oscar-nominee for the R-rated crime film &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998), wanted to work on a film that his children could enjoy. As an enthusiastic fan of the book, he intended to remain more faithful to Dahl&#x27;s vision than the 1971 film had been. Nicolas Cage was under discussions for Willy Wonka, but lost interest. Gary Ross signed to direct in February 2000, which resulted in Frank completing two drafts of the screenplay, before leaving with Ross in September 2001. Both Warner Bros. and the Dahl Estate wanted Frank to stay on the project, but he faced scheduling conflicts and contractual obligations with &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Lookout&quot; (2007).

Rob Minkoff entered negotiations to take the director&#x27;s position in October 2001, and Gwyn Lurie was hired to start from scratch on a new script in February 2002. Lurie said she would adapt the original book and ignore the 1971 film adaptation. Dahl&#x27;s estate championed Lurie after being impressed with her work on another Dahl adaptation, a live-action adaptation of &quot;The BFG&quot;, for Paramount Pictures, which was never made (Paramount distributed the earlier 1971 film version of &quot;Charlie&quot;, and later sold the rights to Warner Bros.). In April 2002, Martin Scorsese was involved with the film, albeit briefly, but opted to direct &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004) instead. Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn wanted Tom Shadyac to direct Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka, believing the duo could make &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; relevant to mainstream audiences, but Liccy Dahl opposed this.

===Pre-production===
In May 2003, Warner Bros. announced that &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; would be one of their tentpole film releases for 2005. Later that month, Tim Burton was hired to direct after receiving enthusiastic approval from the Dahl estate. Burton compared the project&#x27;s languishing development to &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), which he directed, in how there had been varied creative efforts with both films. He said, &quot;Scott Frank&#x27;s version was the best, probably the clearest, and the most interesting, but they had abandoned that.&quot; Liccy Dahl commented that Burton was the first and only director the estate was happy with. He had previously produced another of the author&#x27;s adaptations with &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996), and, like Roald Dahl, disliked the 1971 film because it strayed from the book&#x27;s storyline.

During pre-production, Burton visited Dahl&#x27;s former home in the Buckinghamshire village of Great Missenden. Liccy Dahl remembers Burton entering Dahl&#x27;s famed writing shed and saying, &quot;This is the Buckets&#x27; house!&quot; and thinking to herself, &quot;Thank God, somebody gets it.&quot; Liccy also showed Burton the original handwritten manuscripts, which Burton discovered were more politically incorrect than the published book. The manuscripts included a child named Herpes, after the sexually transmitted infection.

Lurie&#x27;s script received a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, who worked with Burton on &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005), but the director hired &quot;Big Fish&quot; screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch. Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods. August first read &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; when he was eight years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He did not see the 1971 film prior to his hiring, and when asking Burton if he should go back to watch it, August recalled &quot;Tim almost leaped across the table and told me not to.&quot; In terms of the screenwriting process, August said &quot;I literally went through the book with a highlighter and I would save even like little bits of scene description as much as I could, just so it would be as Roald Dahl-y as possible.&quot; &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; took three and a half weeks to write. Burton and August incorporated many parts of the book that were absent from the 1971 film adaptation, including the construction of the Indian Prince&#x27;s chocolate palace, the inclusion of Charlie&#x27;s father, and Veruca Salt&#x27;s attack by squirrels.

Despite their intention to remain close to the source material, Burton and August diverged from the book to explore themes of family, and in doing so unearthed Willy Wonka&#x27;s origin. &quot;We added new elements that aren&#x27;t in the book,&quot; explained Burton, &quot;but I always felt comfortable that everything was in the spirit of the book.&quot; In exploring Wonka&#x27;s upbringing, Burton and August created the character of Dr. Wilbur Wonka, Willy&#x27;s domineering father. Burton thought the paternal character would help explain Willy Wonka himself and that otherwise he would be &quot;just a weird guy&quot;. This element of the film was also personal for Burton. In 2002, Burton, who was somewhat estranged from his own parents, visited his dying mother in Lake Tahoe and discovered she had framed posters of all his films on her walls; this mirroring a scene towards the end of &quot;Charlie&quot; where it is revealed Dr. Wonka has been following his son&#x27;s career with framed newspaper articles on the walls. Burton would later reflect, &quot;I think all artistic endeavors are a way to resolve things, a form of therapy, a fantasy of resolving something. That&#x27;s why I chose to resolve it that way.&quot; The Dahl estate was conflicted about the addition of Wilbur Wonka but ultimately decided to support Burton&#x27;s vision.

Warner Bros. and the director held differences over the characterizations of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to entirely delete Mr. Bucket and make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka would not be a good father, finding the character similar to a recluse. Burton said, &quot;In some ways, he&#x27;s more screwed up than the kids.&quot; Warner Bros. also wanted Charlie to be a , but Burton resisted the characterization. He wanted Charlie to be an average child who would be in the background and not get in trouble.

===Casting===
Prior to Burton&#x27;s involvement, Warner Bros. considered or discussed Willy Wonka with Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Mike Myers, Ben Stiller, Leslie Nielsen, three members of Monty Python (John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin), as well as Patrick Stewart, and Adam Sandler. Dustin Hoffman and Marilyn Manson reportedly sought the role as well. Pitt&#x27;s production company, Plan B Entertainment, however, stayed on to co-finance the film with Warner Bros. Michael Jackson actively sought the role and secretly recorded an original soundtrack for the film at a small studio in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. did not want Jackson for the role, arguing that it would not be marketable for him to be the leading role in a family film. However, they &quot;went nuts&quot; over the soundtrack and offered to acquire the songs in addition to a small role elsewhere in the film. Jackson was upset and shelved the songs.

Johnny Depp was the only actor Burton considered for the role, although Dwayne Johnson was Burton&#x27;s second choice in case Depp was unavailable. This marked the first time Burton did not face pushback from the studio for wanting to cast Depp, as the blockbuster success of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; (2003) had Warner Bros. enthused about Depp being in the leading role. It was Depp&#x27;s intention to portray the character in a completely different way from Gene Wilder in the 1971 film adaptation. Depp and Burton derived their Willy Wonka from children&#x27;s television show hosts such as Bob Keeshan from &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, Fred Rogers, and Al Lewis from &quot;The Uncle Al Show&quot;, and Depp also took inspiration from various game show hosts. Burton recalled from his childhood that the characters were bizarre but left lasting impressions, saying, &quot;I used to watch a guy with a sheriff&#x27;s hat, or a guy who wore a weird leisure suit, or Captain Kangaroo, this guy had a weird haircut and a mustache and sideburns. And you think back and go, &#x27;What the fuck was that?&#x27; But they left a strong impression on you.&quot; Depp based Wonka&#x27;s exaggerated bob cut and sunglasses on &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine editor Anna Wintour. According to Depp, &quot;the hair I imagined as a kind of Prince Valiant do, high bangs and a bob, extreme and very unflattering but something that Wonka probably thinks is cool because he&#x27;s been locked away for such a long time and doesn&#x27;t know any better, like the outdated slang he uses.&quot; Depp also based Wonka&#x27;s unique voice on how he imagined George W. Bush sounding like while high on drugs.

The casting calls for Charlie Bucket, Violet Beauregarde, Veruca Salt, and Mike Teavee took place in the United States and United Kingdom, while Augustus Gloop&#x27;s casting took place in Germany. Burton said he sought actors &quot;who had something of the character in them&quot;, and found Mike Teavee the hardest character to cast. Burton was having trouble casting Charlie, until Depp, who had worked with Freddie Highmore on &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; (2004), suggested Highmore for the part. Highmore had already read the book before, but decided to read it once more prior to auditioning. The actor did not see the original film adaptation, and chose not to see it until after Burton&#x27;s production, so his portrayal would not be influenced. Before Adam Godley was officially cast as Mr. Teavee, Tim Allen, Ray Romano, and Bob Saget were considered for the role. Gregory Peck was reportedly considered for the role of Grandpa Joe but died before being able to accept the role.

===Design===
Production designer Alex McDowell described &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;″s visual aesthetic as &quot;a collision between psychedelic, inflatable pop art and 1960s Russian-American space race&quot;. Tim Burton wanted the setting of the film to be ambiguous in an effort to give the film a fable-like quality similar to the book. McDowell scouted several industrial mill towns in Northern England but came to the conclusion that a real place would not look stylized enough for Burton. &quot;It was back to the Pinewood backlot to start building something that looked grim, wet and depressing on the outside but transitioned believably into a magical kingdom inside.&quot; The town, whose design was shaped by the black and white urban photography of Bill Brandt, as well as Pittsburgh and Northern England, is arranged like a medieval village, with Wonka&#x27;s estate on top and the Bucket shack below. As per the film&#x27;s ambiguous setting, the cars drive down the middle of the roads. The backlot constructed at Pinewood Studios consisted of the factory courtyard, several streets, nearly fifty townhomes, twenty shops, and the Bucket shack. This town was coincidentally constructed on the same backlot Burton had used for Gotham City in &quot;Batman&quot; (1989). The Bucket home was inspired by Roald Dahl&#x27;s famed writing hut, while the exterior of Wonka&#x27;s factory was based on fascist architecture, with Burton remarking &quot;for Wonka&#x27;s factory, we kind of wanted a building with a kind of Hoover Dam-like optimism and strength, but then once it gets dark it looks slightly foreboding.&quot;

For the set pieces in Wonka&#x27;s factory, Burton favored using 360 degree enclosed sets because it offered a complete environment and got rid of visitors. The Inventing Room utilized scrap from the aeronautic industry, defunct confectionery machinery, and old car parts. McDowell compared the design of the Nut Room to that of a hospital with its plastic finish and sterile colors. The crew came up with the layout of the Nut Room fairly quickly, while the color scheme took more time to develop. The Nut Room had to be constructed at an elevation to account for the hole Veruca Salt would have to fall down. The all-white design of the TV Room was adapted directly from the book, though &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) and &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971) also served as inspirations. The designs of each set would influence the style of music for the Oompa-Loompa songs.
Willy Wonka&#x27;s Chocolate Room was built on Pinewood Studios&#x27; 007 Stage, one of the largest soundstages in the world. Sections of artificial grass were laid upon blocks of polystyrene foam that formed the shape of the landscape. For the chocolate river, McDowell insisted on having the river look edible, saying &quot;in the first film, it&#x27;s so distasteful.&quot; According to Tim Burton, &quot;the important thing for me was that we wanted to give the chocolate river a really chocolatey feel, give it a weight, not just brown water. That&#x27;s why we tried to use a real chocolate substitute, to give it a movement and texture.&quot; Joss Williams oversaw the creation of a faux chocolate concoction, taking months to create a non-toxic edible substance with the right consistency. The final mixture, developed by a UK-based chemical company called Vickers, was a mix of water and a thickening agent known as Natrosol, with food dye used to achieve the brown coloring. The river was long, deep, and consisted of of faux chocolate while of the same material made up the waterfall. Wonka&#x27;s boat, used by the characters to travel down the chocolate river, took 20 weeks to build and incorporated 54 animatronic Oompa-Loompas, along with its own internal rowing mechanism.

Colleen Atwood, who served as the costume designer on every live-action Tim Burton film from &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994) to &quot;Dumbo&quot; (2019), was set to reprise her position on &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; but ultimately declined citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;. Burton then selected Italian costume designer Gabriella Pescucci. Ten different jackets and overcoats were designed to find the right look for Willy Wonka. Pescucci described the film&#x27;s wardrobe as &quot;contemporary, but with old world styling&quot;. Wonka&#x27;s latex gloves, which Burton added as a symbol of his detachment from society, were provided by a London-based latex fetish BDSM clothing company.

===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; started on June 21, 2004. While the main set pieces were filmed on soundstages at Pinewood Studios in England, the crew also shot on several locations across the country, with the toothpaste factory filmed at a CompAir factory in High Wycombe, and Veruca Salt&#x27;s manor filmed at Hatfield House for the interior shots and Wrotham Park for the exterior. Various establishing shots were filmed in Germany, Yemen, and the United States. Tim Burton shot &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; simultaneously alongside &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005). Composer Danny Elfman, screenwriter John August, and production designer Alex McDowell served in the same position for both movies. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Deep Roy, and Christopher Lee provided their vocals to &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; during the filming of &quot;Charlie&quot;.

Tim Burton avoided using too many digital effects to reflect the original book&#x27;s emphasis on texture and because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI) wherever possible. Matte paintings were used during the Loompaland and Indian palace sequences. However, several scenes were deemed impossible to achieve realistically without CGI. The Moving Picture Company was tasked with creating entire CG environments for sequences such as the boat ride and the glass elevator tour. A practical method was initially used for Violet Beauregarde&#x27;s inflation; however, Burton was not satisfied by the effects and decided the scene would be accomplished with CGI. Willy Wonka&#x27;s pale complexion was achieved in post-production, using Colorfront to isolate Depp&#x27;s face in each shot and desaturate it.

Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001) and &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003). The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. &quot;Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots—all they do is work, work, work,&quot; Roy commented. &quot;So when it comes time to dance, they&#x27;re like a regiment; they do the same steps.&quot; Roy, who played a total of 165 individual Oompa-Loompas in the film, experienced an especially laborious regimen during production. He was required to regularly practice Pilates with a personal trainer and follow a diet in order for his appearance to remain unchanged during filming. With no prior professional dancing experience, each musical number involving Roy took a month to rehearse and six months in total to film. In referencing his workload during production, Burton called Roy the &quot;hardest-working man in show biz&quot;.

For Veruca Salt&#x27;s demise at the hands of a hundred squirrels, Burton wanted the animals to be real. He consulted with the film&#x27;s animal trainer, Mike Alexander, to determine which parts of the sequence would be achievable with live squirrels. Forty rescue squirrels were trained over 19 weeks, the first three of which were spent making the animals comfortable with their crates and their trainers. The squirrels were then given props and taught how to sit upon a bar stool, tap and then open a walnut, and deposit its meat onto a conveyor belt. According to Alexander, the smartest squirrels were assigned to shell, as those who had difficulty with the regimen were placed in a separate group that ran across the floor and attacked Veruca&#x27;s stunt double. For the shots where the rodents would be in close interaction with Veruca, CG squirrels designed by Framestore CFC were implemented. Several shots called for a hundred animated squirrels, while close-up models required five million computer-generated hairs to look realistic. Animatronic squirrels were also used in the background of shots where a live squirrel would be performing the shelling routine.

Several challenges emerged during filming. The delicate landscape of the Chocolate Room posed a challenge for the crew, with cinematographer Philippe Rousselot recalling that &quot;the set was very impractical for shooting because it was all curves and extraordinarily fragile—as soon as you stepped onto the grass, you destroyed it.&quot; Rousselot instead utilized a cable-suspended camera system known as Cablecam. On one occasion, the camera was improperly secured to the system and subsequently plunged into the faux chocolate river, destroying the $540,000 camera and delaying production. Another hurdle during filming was the existence of British Equity rules, which state that children can only work four and a half hours a day. Filming for &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; took six months, ending in December 2004. Despite these challenges, Burton claimed production ended ahead of schedule.

===Music===

Danny Elfman, similar to Tim Burton, had no emotional attachment to 1971&#x27;s &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. According to Elfman, &quot;I had no trouble divorcing myself from those [original] songs. I&#x27;ve dealt with that a couple of times. You know you&#x27;re dealing with something that&#x27;s going to make a lot of people angry, and you just can&#x27;t think about it.&quot; Because the Oompa-Loompa musical numbers would require complex choreography and be shot on set, Elfman had to compose those songs before filming began. Elfman also composed the songs simultaneously alongside the music from &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;. It was decided at an early stage that Elfman would be providing the vocals for all the Oompa-Loompas, a decision justified by the identical nature of the Oompa-Loompas, with pitch changes and modulations to represent different singers. &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; marks the first time since &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993) that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals.

The first song composed was &quot;Augustus Gloop&quot;, being done as a Bollywood spectacle per Deep Roy&#x27;s suggestion. Elfman recounted, &quot;my original approach was to find a style of music and apply that to all the songs. Tim was like, &#x27;No, no, no, no, no... we&#x27;re going to completely mix it up!&#x27; I said, &#x27;Great, let&#x27;s go.&#x27;&quot; Per Burton&#x27;s suggestion, the Oompa-Loompa songs would each reflect a different style of music: &quot;Violet Beauregarde&quot; is 1970s funk, &quot;Veruca Salt&quot; is 1960s bubblegum and psychedelic pop, and &quot;Mike Teavee&quot; is a tribute to late-1970s hard rock, particularly Queen, and early 1980s hair bands. All four songs utilize lyrics direct from Roald Dahl&#x27;s book; as such, the lyrics are credited to Dahl. Rather than using the book&#x27;s songs in their entirety, Elfman selected specific verses, as he believed using them unabridged would have made each song ten minutes long. &quot;Violet Beauregarde&quot; was the only song that required a partial rewrite, as the song in the book was about a girl who chewed gum rather than Violet Beauregarde herself. The only other song to require vocal performances was &quot;Wonka&#x27;s Welcome Song&quot;, which was written in collaboration with the film&#x27;s screenwriter John August.

In addition to the Oompa-Loompa songs, Elfman created an entire underscore for the film being based around three primary themes: a gentle family theme for the Buckets, generally set in upper woodwinds; a mystical, string-driven waltz for Willy Wonka; and a hyper-upbeat factory theme for full orchestra, Elfman&#x27;s homemade synthesizer samples and the diminutive chanting voices of the Oompa-Loompas. Elfman and Burton differed on their ideas for the main title music, as Elfman imagined something more dreamy while Burton wanted something energetic. Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; plays during a sequence in the film as a direct reference to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). When introducing himself to the golden ticket winners, Wonka quotes &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot; from the 1967 musical &quot;Hair&quot;.

The original motion picture soundtrack was released on July 12, 2005, by Warner Sunset Records. Doug Adams of &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; said of the Oompa-Loompa songs: &quot;Each piece includes something the others don&#x27;t, rhythms or hooks or harmonies that in Elfman&#x27;s inimitable way seem like deconstructions and wholly original concepts at the same time.&quot; Filmtracks.com called the soundtrack a &quot;rhythmically driven affair&quot; because of the mechanical nature of the factory, a departure from Elfman&#x27;s penchant for quieter heartbreaking themes. &quot;Wonka&#x27;s Welcome Song&quot; was honored with a Grammy nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media. Elfman would later cite &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; as being one of the most fun projects he had been involved with.

In 2010, thirteen previously unreleased tracks were included as part of the &quot;Danny Elfman &amp; Tim Burton 25th Anniversary Music Box&quot;. In addition to those tracks, instrumentals of &quot;Wonka&#x27;s Welcome Song&quot; and the Oompa-Loompa songs were included, as well as several demos.

==Release==

&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; had its premiere at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on July 10, 2005, where money for the Make-a-Wish Foundation was raised. In addition to the film&#x27;s cast and crew, the Los Angeles premiere was attended by John Stamos, Seth Green, Lisa Rinna, Harry Hamlin, Larry King, Frankie Muniz, Emma Roberts, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, and Britney Spears. The film was released in the United States on July 15, 2005, in 3,770 theaters. Additionally, the film was digitally re-mastered to simultaneously release in 65 North American IMAX theaters that same day. In the United Kingdom, the premiere was held on July 17 at Leicester Square, only ten days after the July 7 London bombings. It was released nationwide on July 29 in 531 theaters.

The release of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; rekindled public interest in Roald Dahl&#x27;s 1964 book, which appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list from July 3 to October 23, 2005. Burton&#x27;s film also reignited interest in the 1971 film adaptation. According to Michael Böllner, who portrayed Augustus Gloop in &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, the first adaptation was largely unheard of in Germany until Burton&#x27;s version was released.

===Marketing===
Early in the development of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; in February 2000, Warner Bros. announced their intention of marketing the film with a Broadway theatre musical after release. The studio reiterated their interest in May 2003; however, the idea was postponed by the time filming began in June 2004. The teaser poster for &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was released in November 2004, with the teaser trailer premiering the following month in front of showings of &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (2004). The longer theatrical trailer was made available in May 2005 exclusively via Moviefone before its theatrical debut alongside screenings of &quot;Madagascar&quot; (2005).

The main tie-in for &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; focused on the Willy Wonka Candy Company, a division of Nestlé. A small range of Wonka Bars were launched, utilizing their prominence in the film. Echoing the central storyline of the film, Wonka candies introduced their own Golden Ticket contest in Wonka products, including Wonka Bars, Donutz, Laffy Taffy, Nerds, and SweeTarts. The contest&#x27;s prizes included a trip to Europe, a tour of an animation studio, a trip to a sports camp, a shopping spree, and $10,000 cash. 60 million packages of candy participated in the sweepstakes. The contest officially began on June 28 following its announcement on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, and the first winners were announced on July 8. In addition to Nestlé, Hostess introduced Chocolicious WonkaCakes, and Wendy&#x27;s released &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;-themed kids&#x27; meal toys. Other partners included Carlson, Penguin Young Readers, Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, and American Express.

In line with the film&#x27;s theatrical release in the United States, an eponymous tie-in video game was released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Microsoft Windows platforms. The film&#x27;s cast provided their voices for the game, with the sole exception of Depp who was replaced by James Arnold Taylor. The game garnered mostly negative reviews from critics, although Winifred Phillips&#x27;s score attracted some praise.

===Box office===
Although it opened the same day as &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; and within a week of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, the film&#x27;s primary competition for its opening weekend was considered to be the sixth installment in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book series. &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; earned $56,178,450 in its opening weekend in the United States, the fifth-highest opening-weekend gross for 2005, and remained the highest-grossing film for two weeks. $2.2 million of the opening weekend gross was from 65 IMAX theaters, marking the widest domestic IMAX opening ever at the time. At the time of release, the film&#x27;s opening earnings marked Depp&#x27;s highest to date, surpassing &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;″s $46,630,690 opening. &quot;Charlie&quot; also set a record for the best-performing opening in July for a PG-rated film. According to studio exit polling conducted during its opening weekend, 54 percent of the film&#x27;s audience was under the age of 18 and the majority was female.

The film&#x27;s debut in the United Kingdom &quot;smashed even the most optimistic industry projections&quot;, taking in $37.3 million. The film performed well in France, Spain, Australia, and Mexico. Its performance in Germany was considered less than expected. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed $206,459,076 in the United States and $269,366,408 in foreign countries, coming to a worldwide total of $475,825,484.

&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was the 58th-highest-grossing film of all time when released. Worldwide, the film was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2005, while it was the seventh-highest in the United States and fourth-highest in the United Kingdom. It remains the eighteenth-highest-grossing musical film of all time not adjusted for inflation and Tim Burton&#x27;s second-highest-grossing, behind only &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010). It is also the eighth-highest-grossing film of Johnny Depp&#x27;s career. &quot;Forbes&quot; hypothesized that the film&#x27;s success could be attributed to Depp and Burton being at the height of their popularity in 2005.

===Home media===
&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on November 8, 2005. The single-disc version of the film included two special features: an Oompa-Loompa dance tutorial and &quot;Becoming Oompa-Loompa&quot;, which documented Deep Roy&#x27;s experience on the production. A two-disc edition was also released which included six more behind the scenes featurettes: &quot;Chocolate Dreams&quot;, exploring the writing and Tim Burton&#x27;s vision for the film; &quot;Different Faces, Different Flavors&quot;, exploring the characters; &quot;Designer Chocolate&quot;, detailing the production design and costumes; &quot;Sweet Sounds&quot;, how Danny Elfman created the Oompa-Loompa songs; &quot;Under the Wrapper&quot;, detailing the film&#x27;s practical and digital effects; and &quot;Attack of the Squirrels&quot;, exploring how real squirrels were utilized for Veruca Salt&#x27;s elimination. The two-disc edition also contained several games and DVD-Rom features. The film&#x27;s DVD sales underperformed, reaching $16 million by 2010.

For the film&#x27;s HD DVD release in October 2006, all the behind the scenes featurettes from the two-disc edition were included. The HD DVD release also introduced an audio commentary by Burton, a music-only audio track, a &quot;Club Reel&quot;, and an in-movie experience titled &quot;Television Chocolate&quot;, with trivia and interviews overlayed onto the screen during the film. A Blu-ray release followed in October 2011, followed by a 10th anniversary Blu-ray release in March 2015. Both sets featured the same bonus features as the HD DVD, although the anniversary edition included a personal retrospective by Burton and a photo book.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 229 critical reviews of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Closer to the source material than 1971&#x27;s &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is for people who like their &quot;Chocolate&quot; visually appealing and dark.&quot; According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 from 40 critic reviews, the response to the film was &quot;generally favorable&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a positive review, writing &quot;in spite of relapses and imperfections, a few of them serious, Mr. Burton&#x27;s movie succeeds in doing what far too few films aimed primarily at children even know how to attempt anymore, which is to feed—even to glut—the youthful appetite for aesthetic surprise.&quot; Scott also praised Alex McDowell&#x27;s set design, comparing the look of the factory to something out of Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). Mick LaSalle from the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; found &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; Burton&#x27;s &quot;best work in years. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film&#x27;s heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that&#x27;s rare in a child actor.&quot; Peter Travers wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that &quot;Depp&#x27;s deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka&#x27;s secret heart than what Gene Wilder did. Depp and Burton may fly too high on the vapors of pure imagination, but it&#x27;s hard to not get hooked on something this tasty. And how about that army of Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy, in musical numbers that appear to have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley on crack.&quot;

Depp&#x27;s performance as Willy Wonka drew comparisons to Michael Jackson. Roger Ebert was among the critics who made such comparisons, citing Depp&#x27;s performance as the weak spot in an &quot;otherwise mostly delightful&quot; film and noting &quot;[Willy Wonka&#x27;s] reclusive lifestyle, the fetishes of wardrobe and accessories, the elaborate playground built by an adult for the child inside&quot; as parallels between the two. Depp was surprised by the comparisons and stated that he did not base his performance on Jackson. Burton dismissed the comparisons and stated that, unlike Jackson, Depp&#x27;s iteration of the character does not like children. Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized Depp&#x27;s acting: &quot;The cumulative effect isn&#x27;t pretty. Nor is it kooky, funny, eccentric or even mildly interesting. Indeed, throughout his fey, simpering performance, Depp seems to be straining so hard for weirdness that the entire enterprise begins to feel like those excruciating occasions when your parents tried to be hip.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Depp&#x27;s performance, writing &quot;he maintains the paradox, the mystery, of Willy Wonka: a misanthrope who has little patience for children, who can&#x27;t even utter the word &#x27;parents&#x27; without gagging, yet who invents for those same kids the purest and most luscious candies out of the sugar dream of his imagination.&quot; Depp earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Musical or Comedy nomination for his performance but lost to Joaquin Phoenix for &quot;Walk the Line&quot;.

===Gene Wilder&#x27;s reaction===
In 2004, during on-set interviews while filming, Burton criticized the 1971 film adaptation, while Depp paid homage to Gene Wilder&#x27;s portrayal and praised it as &quot;brilliant but subtle&quot;. Wilder was appreciative towards Depp&#x27;s comments, but expressed skepticism toward Burton&#x27;s production, questioning it as a remake made for profit. The filmmakers emphasized that the film was an adaptation of the 1964 book and not a remake of the 1971 film. Depp found Wilder&#x27;s remarks &quot;disappointing&quot;, although &quot;I can understand where he&#x27;s coming from, I guess.&quot; Wilder later praised Depp&#x27;s casting, saying, &quot;If I were going to cast the movie, I would cast Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka because I think he is wonderful. Mysterious—always—and magical.&quot; In 2013, Wilder further criticized the film as a &quot;Warner Bros.&#x27; insult&quot;, disapproving of Burton &quot;for doing stuff like he did&quot;.

===Legacy===

In the years following its release, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; has been described as &quot;popular but divisive&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;, respectively, ranked &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; as Tim Burton&#x27;s third and fourth-best film, calling it &quot;a delectably sustained flight of fancy&quot; and &quot;a bittersweet homage to our whole relationship to candy and pleasure&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Time Out&quot; named it the worst adaptation of a Roald Dahl book, elaborating &quot;there&#x27;s something so horribly garish about Burton&#x27;s film that you can&#x27;t help feeling a little queasy afterwards.&quot; Unlike the 1971 film, Burton&#x27;s film is regarded as more faithful to Dahl&#x27;s text.

Guy Lodge of &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed that the film&#x27;s reputation was hurt by Depp&#x27;s &quot;off-puttingly fey, chilly spin on Wonka&quot;, even though &quot;Burton&#x27;s film handily trumps [the 1971 adaptation] for cinematic verve and vibrancy.&quot; Korey Coleman of &quot;Double Toasted&quot; echoed Lodge&#x27;s sentiments about Depp&#x27;s performance, calling it &quot;unsettling&quot; and &quot;off-putting&quot;. Despite not caring for the overall film, Coleman praised Burton for applying his own vision to the story rather than imitating the 1971 adaptation. In a series reflecting on Burton&#x27;s filmography, Griffin Newman of &quot;Blank Check&quot; praised the film, noting that it had a comic energy that was lacking in Burton&#x27;s subsequent films such as &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010) and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012).

&quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; noted that the film is popular among those who grew up in the 2000s. In 2020, a cosplayer emulating Depp&#x27;s portrayal of Willy Wonka went viral on TikTok, with &quot;Nylon&quot; dubbing him &quot;sexy Willy Wonka&quot;. During the &quot;Depp v. Heard&quot; trial, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was one of the most viewed films on Netflix. In April 2024, Freddie Highmore reprised his role as Charlie Bucket for a skit on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;: a fake trailer for a &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; sequel parodying the &quot;Willy&#x27;s Chocolate Experience&quot; event that had gone viral months earlier.

Paul King and Timothée Chalamet, who respectively directed and starred in &quot;Wonka&quot; (2023), a prequel to Dahl&#x27;s story, stated that they were fans of Burton&#x27;s adaptation. While promoting the film in Japan, Chalamet said, &quot;If you would&#x27;ve told me when I was 12 years old watching the Johnny Depp version of Willy Wonka that I&#x27;d get to be here in Tokyo promoting this movie as Willy Wonka, standing next to Hugh Grant, I would&#x27;ve told you you were lying.&quot; Calah Lane, who portrayed the character of Noodle in &quot;Wonka&quot;, had only seen &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; prior to her audition and was under the impression it was the only adaptation of the book.

<doc id="1277926" wikidata="Q2033747" url="?curid=1277926" title="Pacific decadal oscillation">
<text>The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) is a robust, recurring pattern of ocean-atmosphere climate variability centered over the mid-latitude Pacific basin. The PDO is detected as warm or cool surface waters in the Pacific Ocean, north of 20°N. Over the past century, the amplitude of this climate pattern has varied irregularly at interannual-to-interdecadal time scales (meaning time periods of a few years to as much as time periods of multiple decades). There is evidence of reversals in the prevailing polarity (meaning changes in cool surface waters versus warm surface waters within the region) of the oscillation occurring around 1925, 1947, and 1977; the last two reversals corresponded with dramatic shifts in salmon production regimes in the North Pacific Ocean. This climate pattern also affects coastal sea and continental surface air temperatures from Alaska to California.

During a &quot;warm&quot;, or &quot;positive&quot;, phase, the west Pacific becomes cooler and part of the eastern ocean warms; during a &quot;cool&quot;, or &quot;negative&quot;, phase, the opposite pattern occurs. The Pacific decadal oscillation was named by Steven R. Hare, who noticed it while studying salmon production pattern results in 1997.

The Pacific decadal oscillation index is the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of monthly sea surface temperature anomalies (SST-A) over the North Pacific (poleward of 20°N) after the global average sea surface temperature has been removed. This PDO index is the standardized principal component time series. A PDO &#x27;signal&#x27; has been reconstructed as far back as 1661 through tree-ring chronologies in the Baja California area.

== Mechanisms ==

Several studies have indicated that the PDO index can be reconstructed as the superimposition of tropical forcing and extra-tropical processes. Thus, unlike El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the PDO is not a single physical mode of ocean variability, but rather the sum of several processes with different dynamic origins.

At inter-annual time scales the PDO index is reconstructed as the sum of random and ENSO induced variability in the Aleutian Low, whereas on decadal timescales ENSO teleconnections, stochastic atmospheric forcing and changes in the North Pacific oceanic gyre circulation contribute approximately equally. Additionally sea surface temperature anomalies have some winter to winter persistence due to the reemergence mechanism.
; ENSO teleconnections, the atmospheric bridge

ENSO can influence the global circulation pattern thousands of kilometers away from the equatorial Pacific through the &quot;atmospheric bridge&quot;. During El Niño events, deep convection and heat transfer to the troposphere is enhanced over the anomalously warm sea surface temperature, this ENSO-related tropical forcing generates Rossby waves that propagate poleward and eastward and are subsequently refracted back from the pole to the tropics. The planetary waves form at preferred locations both in the North and South Pacific Ocean, and the teleconnection pattern is established within 2–6 weeks. ENSO driven patterns modify surface temperature, humidity, wind, and the distribution of clouds over the North Pacific that alter surface heat, momentum, and freshwater fluxes and thus induce sea surface temperature, salinity, and mixed layer depth (MLD) anomalies.

The atmospheric bridge is more effective during boreal winter when the deepened Aleutian Low results in stronger and cold northwesterly winds over the central Pacific and warm/humid southerly winds along the North American west coast, the associated changes in the surface heat fluxes and to a lesser extent Ekman transport creates negative sea surface temperature anomalies and a deepened MLD in the central Pacific and warm the ocean from the Hawaii to the Bering Sea.
; SST reemergence

Midlatitude SST anomaly patterns tend to recur from one winter to the next but not during the intervening summer, this process occurs because of the strong mixed layer seasonal cycle. The mixed layer depth over the North Pacific is deeper, typically 100-200m, in winter than it is in summer and thus SST anomalies that form during winter and extend to the base of the mixed layer are sequestered beneath the shallow summer mixed layer when it reforms in late spring and are effectively insulated from the air-sea heat flux. When the mixed layer deepens again in the following autumn/early winter the anomalies may again influence the surface. This process has been named &quot;reemergence mechanism&quot; by Alexander and Deser and is observed over much of the North Pacific Ocean although it is more effective in the west where the winter mixed layer is deeper and the seasonal cycle greater.
;Stochastic atmospheric forcing

Long term sea surface temperature variation may be induced by random atmospheric forcings that are integrated and reddened into the ocean mixed layer. The stochastic climate model paradigm was proposed by Frankignoul and Hasselmann, in this model a stochastic forcing represented by the passage of storms alter the ocean mixed layer temperature via surface energy fluxes and Ekman currents and the system is damped due to the enhanced (reduced) heat loss to the atmosphere over the anomalously warm (cold) SST via turbulent energy and longwave radiative fluxes, in the simple case of a linear negative feedback the model can be written as the separable ordinary differential equation:
formula_1

where v is the random atmospheric forcing, λ is the damping rate (positive and constant) and y is the response.

The variance spectrum of y is:
formula_2

where F is the variance of the white noise forcing and w is the frequency, an implication of this equation is that at short time scales (w»λ) the variance of the ocean temperature increase with the square of the period while at longer timescales(w«λ, ~150 months) the damping process dominates and limits sea surface temperature anomalies so that the spectra became white.

Thus an atmospheric white noise generates SST anomalies at much longer timescales but without spectral peaks. Modeling studies suggest that this process contribute to as much as 1/3 of the PDO variability at decadal timescales.
;Ocean dynamics
Several dynamic oceanic mechanisms and SST-air feedback may contribute to the observed decadal variability in the North Pacific Ocean. SST variability is stronger in the Kuroshio Oyashio extension (KOE) region and is associated with changes in the KOE axis and strength, that generates decadal and longer time scales SST variance but without the observed magnitude of the spectral peak at ~10 years, and SST-air feedback. Remote reemergence occurs in regions of strong current such as the Kuroshio extension and the anomalies created near the Japan may reemerge the next winter in the central pacific.
;Advective resonance
Saravanan and McWilliams have demonstrated that the interaction between spatially coherent atmospheric forcing patterns and an advective ocean shows periodicities at preferred time scales when non-local advective effects dominate over the local sea surface temperature damping. This &quot;advective resonance&quot; mechanism may generate decadal SST variability in the Eastern North Pacific associated with the anomalous Ekman advection and surface heat flux.
;North Pacific oceanic gyre circulation 
Dynamic gyre adjustments are essential to generate decadal SST peaks in the North Pacific, the process occurs via westward propagating oceanic Rossby waves that are forced by wind anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. The quasi-geostrophic equation for long non-dispersive Rossby Waves forced by large scale wind stress can be written as the linear partial differential equation:
formula_3

where h is the upper-layer thickness anomaly, τ is the wind stress, c is the Rossby wave speed that depends on latitude, ρ0 is the density of sea water and f0 is the Coriolis parameter at a reference latitude. The response time scale is set by the Rossby waves speed, the location of the wind forcing and the basin width, at the latitude of the Kuroshio Extension c is 2.5 cm s−1 and the dynamic gyre adjustment timescale is ~(5)10 years if the Rossby wave was initiated in the (central)eastern Pacific Ocean.

If the wind white forcing is zonally uniform it should generate a red spectrum in which h variance increases with the period and reaches a constant amplitude at lower frequencies without decadal and interdecadal peaks, however low frequencies atmospheric circulation tends to be dominated by fixed spatial patterns so that wind forcing is not zonally uniform, if the wind forcing is zonally sinusoidal then decadal peaks occurs due to resonance of the forced basin-scale Rossby waves.

The propagation of h anomalies in the western pacific changes the KOE axis and strength and impact SST due to the anomalous geostrophic heat transport. Recent studies suggest that Rossby waves excited by the Aleutian low propagate the PDO signal from the North Pacific to the KOE through changes in the KOE axis while Rossby waves associated with the NPO propagate the North Pacific Gyre oscillation signal through changes in the KOE strength.

== Impacts ==

 Temperature and precipitation 

The PDO spatial pattern and impacts are similar to those associated with ENSO events. During the positive phase the wintertime Aleutian Low is deepened and shifted southward, warm/humid air is advected along the North American west coast and temperatures are higher than usual from the Pacific Northwest to Alaska but below normal in Mexico and the Southeastern United States. &lt;br&gt;
Winter precipitation is higher than usual in the Alaska Coast Range, Mexico and the Southwestern United States but reduced over Canada, Eastern Siberia and Australia &lt;br&gt;
McCabe et al. showed that the PDO along with the AMO strongly influence multidecadal droughts pattern in the United States, drought frequency is enhanced over much of the Northern United States during the positive PDO phase and over the Southwest United States during the negative PDO phase in both cases if the PDO is associated with a positive AMO.&lt;br&gt;
The Asian Monsoon is also affected, increased rainfall and decreased summer temperature is observed over the Indian subcontinent during the negative phase.

== Reconstructions and regime shifts ==

The PDO index has been reconstructed using tree rings and other hydrologically sensitive proxies from west North America and Asia.

MacDonald and Case reconstructed the PDO back to 993 using tree rings from California and Alberta. The index shows a 50–70 year periodicity but is a strong mode of variability only after 1800, a persistent negative phase occurring during medieval times (993–1300) which is consistent with La Niña conditions reconstructed in the tropical Pacific and multi-century droughts in the South-West United States.

Several regime shifts are apparent both in the reconstructions and instrumental data, during the 20th century regime shifts associated with concurrent changes in SST, SLP, land precipitation and ocean cloud cover occurred in 1924/1925, 1945/1946, and 1976/1977:
*1750: PDO displays an unusually strong oscillation.
*1924/1925: PDO changed to a &quot;warm&quot; phase.
*1945/1946: The PDO changed to a &quot;cool&quot; phase, the pattern of this regime shift is similar to the 1970s episode with maximum amplitude in the subarctic and subtropical front but with a greater signature near the Japan while the 1970s shift was stronger near the American west coast.
*1976/1977: PDO changed to a &quot;warm&quot; phase.
*1988/1989: A weakening of the Aleutian low with associated SST changes was observed, in contrast to others regime shifts this change appears to be related to concurrent extratropical oscillation in the North Pacific and North Atlantic rather than tropical processes.
*1997/1998: Several changes in sea surface temperature and marine ecosystem occurred in the North Pacific after 1997/1998, in contrast to prevailing anomalies observed after the 1970s shift. The SST declined along the United States west coast and substantial changes in the populations of salmon, anchovy and sardine were observed as the PDO changed back to a cool &quot;anchovy&quot; phase. However the spatial pattern of the SST change was different with a meridional SST seesaw in the central and western Pacific that resembled a strong shift in the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation rather than the PDO structure. This pattern dominated much of the North Pacific SST variability after 1989.
*The 2014 flip from the cool PDO phase to the warm phase, which vaguely resembles a long and drawn-out El Niño event, contributed to record-breaking surface temperatures across the planet in 2014.

== Predictability ==
The NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory produces official ENSO forecasts, and Experimental statistical forecasts using a linear inverse modeling (LIM) method to predict the PDO, LIM assumes that the PDO can be separated into a linear deterministic component and a non-linear component represented by random fluctuations.

Much of the LIM PDO predictability arises from ENSO and the global trend rather than extra-tropical processes and is thus limited to ~4 seasons. The prediction is consistent with the seasonal footprinting mechanism in which an optimal SST structure evolves into the ENSO mature phase 6–10 months later that subsequently impacts the North Pacific Ocean SST via the atmospheric bridge.

Skills in predicting decadal PDO variability could arise from taking into account the impact of the externally forced and internally generated Pacific variability.

*ENSO tends to lead PDO cycling.
*Shifts in the IPO change the location and strength of ENSO activity. The South Pacific convergence zone moves northeast during El Niño and southwest during La Niña events. The same movement takes place during positive IPO and negative IPO phases respectively. (Folland et al., 2002)
*Interdecadal temperature variations in China are closely related to those of the NAO and the NPO.

*Sea level rise is affected when large areas of water warm and expand, or cool and contract.

<doc id="1277932" wikidata="Q2120215" url="?curid=1277932" title="R.B.I. Baseball">
<text>R.B.I. Baseball is a baseball sports video game series. &quot;R.B.I.&quot; stands for &quot;runs batted in&quot;. Launched in 1987 as a localized version of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Family Stadium&quot; series, the &quot;R.B.I. Baseball&quot; series initially ran through 1995. In 2014, the series was rebooted as a competitor to &quot;&quot;, with releases each year until its cancellation. The series ended in 2022 with the release of &quot;MLB The Show 22&quot; on the Nintendo Switch.

==History==

Namco developed and released &quot;Pro Yakyū: Family Stadium&quot; (&quot;Pro Baseball: Family Stadium&quot;) for the Family Computer (Famicom), the first game in their &quot;Family Stadium&quot; series, on December 10, 1986. &quot;Pro Baseball: Family Stadium&quot; was created by Namco programmer Yoshihiro Kishimoto, who had previously worked on games such as &quot;Baraduke&quot; (1985).

Atari Games released a Nintendo VS. System arcade machine of &quot;Family Stadium&quot; named &quot;Atari R.B.I. Baseball&quot; in 1987. Atari programmer Peter Lipson adapted &quot;Family Stadium&quot; into the American localized version &quot;R.B.I. Baseball&quot; for the NES, which was published by Atari Games subsidiary Tengen. Subsequent editions were published until 1995, mostly on Sega systems.

In 2014, Major League Baseball Advanced Media, the digital arm of MLB, revived the name for a new series of MLB games featuring arcade-style gameplay influenced by the original series. The new series, which had annual releases, was made available on multiple platforms. The series was meant to contrast the Sony-published and formerly PlayStation-exclusive &quot;MLB The Show&quot;, which is considered more simulationist in its focus. In 2022, the series was cancelled due to the release of &quot;MLB The Show 22&quot; on the Nintendo Switch.

==Gameplay==

&quot;RBI Baseball&quot; was the first console game of its kind to be licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and used actual MLB player names, unlike other baseball video games of the late 1980s. As it was not licensed by Major League Baseball (MLB) itself, it did not use team names or logos. Instead, the game contained 8 teams listed by only their location: Boston, California, Detroit, Houston, Minnesota, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco; their real-life, MLB counterparts were the first place teams in each division in (Boston, California, Houston, New York) and (Detroit, Minnesota, St. Louis, San Francisco) MLB seasons. The game also boasted two All-Star teams, American League and National League; the two featured established veterans such as George Brett, Mike Schmidt, Dale Murphy and Andre Dawson—none of whom appeared on the other eight teams—and up-and-coming players like Mark McGwire, Andrés Galarraga, Kevin Seitzer and José Canseco.

Each player has different capabilities in the game; hitters vary in ability to make solid contact, to hit the ball with power, and their base running speed. Vince Coleman is the fastest player in the game; it is very difficult to catch him stealing second base. Pitchers vary in pitching speed, and the amount by which the player can steer the ball left and right during its flight. Pitchers also have varying stamina; as a pitcher gets tired, the ball slows down and is harder to steer. Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens are two pitchers in the game with the fastest pitches. Fernando Valenzuela, without a hard fastball, has tremendous movement in both directions with his pitches. Mike Scott has a sharp and deceptive breaking ball. The best pitcher is debatable, depending on how they are used by the players. There is no evidence that fielding abilities correspond to individual players.

The abilities of each player do not necessarily correspond with the statistics shown on the screen when the player comes to bat or takes the mound. These statistics are generally accurate, with many exceptions. They do not change during the course of the game or sequence of games.

A rudimentary box score is displayed during and after the game showing composite statistics for each team. A hit batter is credited with a walk, and anyone reaching on an error gets credited for a hit even as the other team is charged with an error. Conversely, a batter thrown out while trying for extra bases is not credited with a hit.

The infield fly rule is not implemented.

The rosters for the eight teams are fairly accurate if simplified representations of the playoff rosters from their respective years. Each team has 8 starting batters, four bench players, two starting pitchers and two relievers. The player can start any pitcher they like, though the relievers have very low stamina. If they play consecutive games without resetting the system, any starting pitcher used in the previous game will be unavailable. The player has to wait until the game starts before substituting players with pinch hitters, who can play any position. Pinch runners are not implemented.

Unlike Major League Baseball, R.B.I. Baseball implements the mercy rule—if one team is ahead by ten or more runs after any number of completed innings, the game ends immediately.

Additionally, while the statistics shown on the screen for each player in the original game were reasonably accurate, their playing attributes were not always accurate. For example, George Brett was depicted in-game as a right-handed batter, while the real-life Brett batted left-handed. Also, all real-life switch hitters, such as Tim Raines, were depicted exclusively as left-handed batters.

In &quot;Vs. RBI Baseball&quot;, the teams are made up of legends from 10 different franchises. These players were statistically represented with their best seasons. A notable exception was that of McGwire, who was included on the Oakland team, and was statistically represented by his potential numbers. In a remarkable display of foresight, he was projected to hit 62 home runs in his best season. In 1998, he set the then-major league record for home runs in a season with 70.

From the second game onward in the original R.B.I. Baseball series, all of the (then) 26 (later 28) Major League Baseball teams were featured; however, these later games also did not have a full MLB license, so the teams were only identified by their cities (though they still had real player names as they had the MLBPA license). Beginning with the third game in the series, some playoff teams of the recent past were featured, which also include the rosters of those teams in the years that they qualified.

==Reception==
Most every edition of &quot;R.B.I. Baseball&quot; typically received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot; from critics starting with its 2014 reboot, according to review aggregator Metacritic. &quot;R.B.I. Baseball 19&quot; received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

IGN called &quot;R.B.I. Baseball 14&quot; and &quot;15&quot; &quot;bad&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; gave bad reviews to &quot;16&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, and &quot;18&quot;. &quot;18&quot; was criticized for its animation and collision detection. &quot;Polygon&quot; called &quot;R.B.I. Baseball 18&quot; &quot;primitive&quot;.

&quot;R.B.I. Baseball 18&quot; was nominated for &quot;Sports Game&quot; and &quot;Strategy/Simulation Game&quot; at the 2019 Webby Awards.

<doc id="1277935" wikidata="Q7750176" url="?curid=1277935" title="The Maneater">
<text>The Maneater is an official, editorially independent student news publication at the University of Missouri. &quot;The Maneater&quot; editorial and advertising staffs are composed entirely of students, with the exception of a professional business adviser. Financially, The Maneater is a non-profit publication funded by advertisers. The newspaper is distributed free of charge, and all aspects of its website remain accessible at no cost to readers. The editorial department of The Maneater remains independent from any student governments and organizations, as well as the Missouri School of Journalism and university itself.

== History ==
&quot;The Maneater&quot; was founded in 1955 by Joel Gold, then a sociology student, as editor-in-chief and Jim Willard as business manager. Gold took over the former newspaper, then named the Missouri Student and controlled by the Delta Upsilon fraternity. Gold renamed it &quot;The Maneater&quot; to reflect a more aggressive news angle and transitioned the paper into an independent watchdog of the university.

Regarding the name change, Gold wrote in the first issue of &quot;The Maneater&quot;, “The name ‘Missouri Student’ reflected the editorial policy of the former paper quite well. It signified nothing... The Maneater by its very name cannot content itself with merely presenting the news... The Maneater is a tiger with fangs bared and claws sharpened ready to analyze the facts and then to pounce. A tiger exists because it is, and not for one group or another.”

From 1969 to 2013, &quot;The Maneater&quot; newspaper was published twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Fridays, during the academic year. A growing desire for digital content led the paper to scale back to a weekly publishing schedule beginning in August 2013. In 2019, the paper had to change to a monthly printing cycle rather than weekly due to funding. As of March 2023, the newspaper is exclusively digital.

== Independent news ==
Though the Missouri Student was established in 1926 as a student paper, it fell under the purview of a Student Publications Board made up of MU faculty and was printed by the School of Journalism. It was the publications board that invited Gold to apply for editor-in-chief following the noticeable shift that had occurred at the paper by 1950. The news publication developed into a Greek Town rag and society paper, favoring party commentary before news reporting. From 1950 to 1955, six members from the Delta Upsilon Fraternity controlled the paper. As circulation numbers dropped, the publications board sought to shake up the Student. Given the task of refurbishing the paper, Gold likened The Maneater&#x27;s new editorial policy to an aggressive news source, with the goal of turning out stories that students would want to read.

&quot;The Maneater&quot; soon took to its stand as a harsh critic of student government, penning many articles and editorials on its practices. It went on to find its footing covering multiple wars and anti-war protests. In 1969, School of Journalism printers decided they couldn&#x27;t typeset a caption describing the vulgarities of a cartoon printed and distributed by a student, later expelled from the university, on campus. Readers opened the paper to a series of dashes printed in the caption&#x27;s place. According to the paper&#x27;s university editor at the time, by the middle of the decade, the relationship between the university and The Maneater deteriorated.

Until 1970, an issue of &quot;The Maneater&quot; cost 10 cents. Facing harsh competition from an upstart rival paper called the Campus Courier, which distributed its issues at no cost to readers, The Maneater was forced to make itself free as well in order to compete, and although the Courier lasted only a year, the loss of 10 cents an issue and more competition for advertising put The Maneater into substantial debt that lasted until the middle of the decade. Nevertheless, &quot;The Maneater&quot; has remained free ever since.

The School of Journalism has offered to absorb The Maneater into its system many times through its history. However, The Maneater has remained afloat of its own accord and remains distant from any such attempts. Today, &quot;The Maneater&quot; is a division of the university&#x27;s Department of Student Life. The paper was printed in Sedalia, Mo., and though a publications board still exists to handle the publication&#x27;s internal matters, its editorial content remains independent of any university authority or student group.

== Awards ==
Both the newspaper and website are highly decorated publications. &quot;The Maneater&quot; has been consistently distinguished by state and national press honors, including several ACP Pacemaker Awards, Society of Professional Journalists Mark of Excellence Awards and Missouri College Media Association Better Newspaper Contest awards.

The Pacemaker Award, widely considered the Pulitzer Prize of collegiate journalism, has been awarded to The Maneater newspaper four times, in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2007. The paper was a finalist in 1993, 1994, 2000 and 2012. The Maneater website has received the Online Pacemaker (established in 2000) five times, in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2012. It was a finalist in 2005.

== MOVE Magazine ==
Since 2002, &quot;The Maneater&quot; has also produced an entertainment weekly called &quot;MOVE Magazine.&quot; MOVE is aimed at local and national news as well as extensive coverage of lifestyle, arts and entertainment. In addition to a more recent focus on the Columbia, Mo. cultural scene. In 2012 and 2013, MOVE featured interviews with artists such as Passion Pit, Wilco, Ingrid Michaelson and The Wonder Years. Semester special editions have included coverage of Columbia&#x27;s Treeline Music Festival (formerly known as Roots N Blues N BBQ) and the True/False Film Fest.

Prior to fall 2013, MOVE had been published as an insert within &quot;The Maneater&quot;, under its own style and design guidelines, with the eventual hope that it could develop into its own distinct publication. However, under the 2013-14 editorial board, MOVE replaced the Arts and Entertainment section of the newspaper and was integrated more uniformly with the rest of The Maneater. In the 2016–17 school year, MOVE set itself apart once again as the main student-run campus magazine. As of 2023, MOVE Magazine remains a sub-publication of &quot;The Maneater&quot; and releases semesterly, digital editions.

<text>The Linton Bushfire was a wildfire that burned through private land and state forests near the township of Linton, Victoria, Australia on 2 December 1998. Firefighters from the Victorian state government&#x27;s Department of Natural Resources and Environment and the Country Fire Authority (CFA) were deployed to put out the fire. At approximately 8.45pm, two firefighting appliances and their crews were entrapped and engulfed in fire following an unexpected wind change. The bushfire covered a maximum land of 660 hectares of private and public land.

==Accident==
The crew of one of those appliances, five men from Geelong, who were all volunteers from the Geelong West Fire Brigade were killed.

The coronial inquest examining the fire and the deaths, was one of the longest-running inquests in the history of the state. It was this inquest, that led to changes in safety operating procedures in the SA Country Fire Service and Victorian Country Fire Authority, relating to the Dead Man Zone.

==Firefighters==
The five Geelong West volunteer firefighters that died in the Linton fire were Christopher Evans, Garry Vredeveldt, Stuart Davidson, Jason Thomas and Matthew Armstrong.

A memorial for the firefighters was placed in West Park, Geelong West. Another one was put in Linton, Victoria.

Grovedale College, who lost a former pupil in the fire, instituted an award named after Jason Thomas, for the student who has best served the community.

<text>Barrie C. Cooke (1931 – 4 March 2014) was an English-born Irish abstract expressionist painter.

Cooke was born in Knutsford, to an English father and an American mother, and spent part of his childhood in Jamaica and Bermuda, before moving to the U.S. in 1947, where he studied art history at Harvard University. He moved to Ireland in 1954, and in 1955 went to Salzburg to study under Austrian artist Oskar Kokoschka. His work is represented in such collections as the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Ulster Museum, the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), the Haags Gemeentemuseum (The Hague), and other public and private collections worldwide.

He was a friend and collaborator of both Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney, illustrating Hughes&#x27;s &quot;The Great Irish Pike&quot; (1982) and Heaney&#x27;s Bog Poems (1975).

The Barrie Cooke archive which contains letters and poems from friends, including Heaney and Hughes is at Pembroke College, Cambridge.

He died in 2014 in Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Ireland.

<text>Tomás José Ruiz González (born March 23, 1963) is a Mexican politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, who most recently served as a state government official in Veracruz under Governor Javier Duarte. He previously served as director of the National Lottery and as president of the New Alliance Party (Nueva Alianza), a position he held from November 28, 2006 to August 28, 2007.

==Biography==
Tomás Ruiz holds a law degree from the Escuela Libre de Derecho, has a diploma from the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico and a Master&#x27;s from Columbia University. In the late 1980s and 1990s, he held important positions in the Bank of Mexico and the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit, for which he was twice the Undersecretary of Finance, as well as the first president of the Tax Administration Service (SAT).

In 2000, PAN president Vicente Fox appointed him director general of Banobras. This non-PRI position conflicted with the leadership of his party, and he resigned in 2003 to be nominated by the PRI as candidate for federal deputy of the LIX Legislature of the Mexican Congress. He was a proportional representation deputy elected from the third electoral region and served on a trio of business-related commissions: Finances and Public Credit, Budget and Public Accounts, and Oversight of the Superior Auditor of the Federation.

He worked alongside PRI parliamentary coordinator Elba Esther Gordillo in the Chamber of Deputies when a conflict arose between Gordillo and the president of the PRI, Roberto Madrazo Pintado. He supported a failed fiscal reform measure that would have extended the application of value-added tax to food and medicine products and wound up dividing the PRI parliamentary faction in the Chamber of Deputies. After the dismissal of Gordillo from the PRI, González resigned from the Chamber of Deputies and was replaced by José Luis García Mercado. In 2004, he took the position as head of the National Lottery; in October 2005, he broke ties with the PRI, of which he had been a member for 20 years.

On November 29, 2006, he was elected president of Nueva Alianza, replacing Miguel Ángel Jiménez Godinez. He resigned just nine months later and was replaced by Jorge Kahwagi.

In 2010, Ruiz González&#x27;s political career was resuscitated when new Governor of Veracruz Javier Duarte appointed him as the state&#x27;s Secretary of Finance, a position in which he remained until March 2013, when he resigned for &quot;personal reasons&quot; and left the department in a severe cash crisis. He rejoined the PRI in July 2012. Two years after leaving the state government, Duarte put Ruiz back in his cabinet, this time as state secretary of infrastructure and public works.

In July 2016, one local PAN politician said that Ruiz had &quot;disappeared&quot; from the state of Veracruz, a year after awarding a concession for an underwater tunnel in Coatzacoalcos that was still not complete.

<text>Silvia Pinal Hidalgo (12September 193128November 2024) was a Mexican actress. She began her career in theatre before venturing into cinema in 1949. She became one of the greatest female stars of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema and, with her performance in &quot;Shark!&quot; (1969), part of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Her work in film and popularity in her native country led Pinal to work in Europe, particularly in Spain and Italy. Pinal achieved international recognition by starring in a trilogy of films directed by Luis Buñuel: &quot;Viridiana&quot; (1961), &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot; (1962) and &quot;Simon of the Desert&quot; (1965). 

In addition to her film career, Pinal pioneered musical theatre in Mexico, had a successful career in television, and held a series of public roles and political offices, including First Lady of Tlaxcala in the 1980s and elected terms in the Chamber of Deputies, the Assembly of Representatives of the Federal District, and the Senate of the Republic. She was considered &quot;the last diva&quot; of the Golden Age of Mexican film.

==Early life==
Silvia Pinal Hidalgo was born in Guaymas, Sonora, on 12September 1931. Her parents were María Luisa Hidalgo Aguilar and Moisés Pasquel. Pasquel was an orchestra conductor at radio station XEW by whom Hidalgo Aguilar became pregnant when she was 15 years old. Her father did not acknowledge Pinal as his child, and she did not know him until she was 11 years old. Her biological father sired three more children: Eugenio, Moisés, and Virginia. However, Pinal never spent time with the Pasquel family. Pinal spent her first years behind the counter of a seafood restaurant near XEW, where her mother worked. When she was five years old, her mother married Luis G. Pinal, a journalist, military man, and politician 20 years her senior. Pinal subsequently adopted Silvia as his daughter and, in later interviews, she described Pinal as her only father. Pinal also had three daughters from a previous marriage: Mercedes, Beatriz and Eugenia. Luis Pinal held several public positions, including serving as the municipal president of Tequisquiapan, Querétaro.

Pinal had an interest in show business since she was a child. In addition to film and music, she liked to write and recite poems. She studied first at Pestalozzi College in Cuernavaca and then at the Washington Institute in Mexico City. Despite her artistic aspirations, her father cautioned her to look for &quot;something useful&quot;, so she learned to type. At age 14, she began working as a secretary at Kodak.

Pinal went to study opera and began preparing by taking classes, first with a private teacher and then with Professor Reyes Retana. Her first step toward fame occurred when she was invited to participate in a beauty pageant. In this contest, Pinal obtained the title of Student Princess of Mexico. At her coronation, she met the actors Rubén Rojo and Manolo Fábregas, with whom she became close friends. While studying &quot;bel canto&quot;, Pinal went to work as a secretary in the pharmaceutical laboratories of Carlos Stein. At the music academy, Pinal auditioned for a role in the opera &quot;La Traviata&quot;. However, the audition was a failure. A teacher encouraged her to take acting courses at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA), where she was a classmate of figures such as Carlos Pellicer, Salvador Novo and Xavier Villaurrutia. She debuted as an extra in a performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Career==

===Beginning===
Pinal continued working in the advertising department of a pharmaceutical products firm. Aware that she was studying acting, her boss allowed her to participate in recording radio comedies for the station XEQ. She debuted in the comedy &quot;Dos pesos la dejada&quot;.

At the radio station, Pinal met publicists who invited her to join an experimental company. With that company, she debuted in the play &quot;Los caprichos de Goya&quot;. The director of this work was the Cuban-Mexican actor and director Rafael Banquells, with whom Pinal began an employment relationship and a close friendship that led to romance. Banquells got Carlos Laverne to allow them to use Mexico City&#x27;s Ideal Theater for their productions. Laverne chose Pinal to participate in a montage with the company of the Ideal Theater, directed by the Spanish actress Isabelita Blanch. The work was called &quot;Nuestra Natacha&quot;. Pinal acted in numerous productions for this company. Her first starring role was in &quot;Un sueño de cristal&quot;.

===Film===
Just fifteen days after she debuted in the theater, Pinal made her debut in the cinema with a brief role in &quot;Bamba&quot; (1949), starring Carmen Montejo and directed by Miguel Contreras Torres. Contreras Torres had seen her work at the Ideal Theatre and invited her to participate in the project. Contreras Torres was a demanding, strict director who made Pinal suffer for her inexperience. That same year, she performed in the film &quot;&quot;, directed by Julián Soler and starring Meche Barba. In that film, she worked for the first time in cinema with Rafael Banquells, who had become her husband. Immediately, she played another small role in the movie &quot;Escuela para casadas&quot;, by Miguel Zacarías. Pinal met and worked for the first time with the actor and singer Pedro Infante in the film &quot;La mujer que yo perdí&quot;. The actor and comedian Cantinflas (a close personal friend) chose Pinal as his co-star in &quot;El portero&quot; (1950). Her breakthrough participation was in the comedy &quot;El rey del barrio&quot; (1949), co-starring with Germán Valdés &quot;Tin Tan&quot;, directed by Gilberto Martínez Solares. Pinal and Tin Tan acted together in two more films: &quot;La marca del zorrillo&quot; (1950) and &quot;Me traes de un ala&quot; (1952).

Pinal won her first Silver Ariel as a supporting actress for her performance in the film &quot;Un rincón cerca del cielo&quot; (1952), where she worked again with Infante. In 1952, she performed with Joaquín Pardavé in the comedies &quot;Doña Mariquita de mi corazón&quot; and &quot;El casto Susano&quot;. In 1953, Pinal got her first starring roles in the films &quot;Reventa de esclavas&quot; (1953) and &quot;Yo soy muy macho&quot; (1953). In that same year, she performed in the musical film &quot;Mis tres viudas alegres&quot;, where she shared credits with Lilia del Valle and the Cuban rumba dancer Amalia Aguilar. They also starred in the comedy &quot;Las cariñosas&quot;. That same year, she acted with Libertad Lamarque in &quot;Si volvieras a mí&quot;.

Pinal gained success and recognition in 1954 after appearing in the film &quot;Un extraño en la escalera&quot;, directed by Tulio Demicheli, where she starred alongside Arturo de Córdova. Initially, de Córdova preferred either the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida or the Cuban rumba dancer Rosa Carmina as his co-stars, due to his reservations about Pinal&#x27;s youth. With the support of the producer Gregorio Walerstein, Pinal transformed her image, emphasizing her sex appeal, which ultimately led to de Córdova&#x27;s approval for the role. The movie became a major success, solidifying Pinal&#x27;s status as a leading film actress.

Another director who effectively utilized Pinal&#x27;s acting skills was Alberto Gout. Under his direction, Pinal starred in &quot;La sospechosa&quot; (1954). Pinal participated in &#x27; (1954), a film in which Pinal co-starred with actresses María Elena Marqués, Columba Domínguez and Irasema Dilián. With Tito Davison as director, Pinal also filmed the Mexican-Spanish-Chilean co-production &quot;Cabo de Hornos&quot; (1955), along with the actor Jorge Mistral. Pinal worked again with Pedro Infante as his co-star in the celebrated comedy &quot;El inocente&quot; (1955). Pinal starred in several films by Demicheli, including &#x27; (1955), which would bring her first Silver Ariel Award as best actress. Her second was thanks to her role in the film &quot;La dulce enemiga&quot; (1957), directed by Davison. In 1956, Pinal starred in &quot;Una cita de amor&quot; (1956), where she worked under the direction of Emilio Fernández.
Pinal&#x27;s popularity and success in Mexico paved the way for her to work in Europe, following the advice of Demicheli. Her first project was the Spanish-Mexican co-production &quot;Las locuras de Bárbara&quot; (1958), directed by Demicheli. Under his direction, she also starred in the Spanish musical film &quot;Charlestón&quot;. Given the success of her films in Europe, Pinal was invited to work in Italy, co-starring with Vittorio de Sica and Elke Sommer in the film &quot;Uomini e Nobiluomini&quot; (1959). Under the direction of José María Forqué, Pinal starred in the Spanish film &quot;Maribel y la extraña familia&quot; (1960). In 1961, she filmed the Spanish musical film &quot;&quot;, along with Fernando Fernán Gómez.

Pinal had her first contact with Luis Buñuel through Mexican actor Ernesto Alonso, with the firm intention of starring in the film version of Pérez Galdós&#x27;s novel &quot;Tristana&quot; in the 1950s. However, the tiny commercial success of Buñuel&#x27;s films prevented the producers from financing the project. By the end of the 1960s, Buñuel shot the film in Spain with Catherine Deneuve instead. Years later, Pinal, with the help of her second husband, producer Gustavo Alatriste, looked for Buñuel in Spain and convinced him to film &quot;Viridiana&quot; (1961), also loosely based on a Pérez Galdós novel. It was the winner of the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Despite the success and prestige enjoyed by the film, it was rejected by the Spanish censorship board (Spain was under the Franco dictatorship) and the Vatican at the time, who described the film as blasphemous. The film was saved through Pinal&#x27;s intervention, when she fled to Mexico with a copy. The Vatican censorship also resonated in Mexico, but with the help of Salvador Novo, the film had a limited release.

Pinal achieved international acclaim through a trilogy. Her second film with Buñuel was &quot;El ángel exterminador&quot; (1962), in which Pinal starred with a choral cast. The film also received critical acclaim worldwide. In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; recognized it among the best films ever. Her third and last project with Buñuel was &quot;Simón del desierto&quot; (1964). The film, misrepresented as a medium-length feature, was initially conceived as an episodic film. Pinal and Gustavo Alatriste looked for Federico Fellini to direct a second episode, but Fellini accepted only on the condition that his wife, Giulietta Masina, star in it. They then sought out Jules Dassin, who likewise said he would accept the project only on the condition that his wife, Melina Mercouri, star; Pinal also rejected this condition. The idea was that Pinal should star in all the episodes, so Buñuel ended up filming the project himself. In the film, Pinal also made the first nude appearance in her career, an act still rare in Mexican cinema and the first nude scene in Buñuel&#x27;s films.

Pinal was also on the verge of starring with Buñuel in the film &quot;Diary of a Chambermaid&quot; in France. She learned French and was willing to receive no pay for her role. However, French producer Serge Silberman ended up choosing Jeanne Moreau. Pinal was also going to shoot with Buñuel in Spain on &quot;Divinas palabras&quot;, but there were problems obtaining a copyright for the film. Years later, Pinal finally shot the movie in Mexico with Juan Ibáñez, featuring a nude scene.

After her work with Buñuel, Pinal returned to the cinema with the comedy &quot;Buenas noches, año nuevo&quot; (1964), where she co-starred with Ricardo Montalbán. In 1966 she made the film &#x27;, directed by José Bolaños and inspired by the Mexican Revolution. That same year, she participated in the Mexican-Brazilian co-production &quot;Juego peligroso&quot;, directed by Luis Alcoriza and based on a script by Gabriel García Márquez. She also appeared in the Franco-Italian-Mexican co-production &quot;Guns for San Sebastian&quot;, along with Anthony Quinn and Charles Bronson. In 1967 Pinal appeared in &quot;Shark!&quot;, with Burt Reynolds and directed by Samuel Fuller, making this the only Hollywood production in which Pinal appeared. Pinal starred in the film &#x27; (1968), based on a popular cartoon by Yolanda Vargas Dulché. Between the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pinal mostly made comedy films directed by René Cardona Jr. In 1976, Pinal starred in &quot;&quot;, a psychological suspense thriller.

Pinal returned in 1992 with the movie &quot;Modelo Antiguo&quot;, directed by Raúl Araiza. The decline of Mexican cinema and Pinal&#x27;s activities on television and in other fields, such as politics, reduced the time she spent making films. In later years, her film appearances were limited to &quot;Ya no los hacen como antes&quot; (2002) her first and only dubbing role in &quot;El Agente 00-P2&quot; (2009) and a brief special appearance in &quot;Tercera llamada&quot; (2013), her last feature film.

===Stage===
Pinal made her theatrical debut at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. Eventually, she acted in experimental plays, then worked at the Ideal Theater in Mexico City. Outside of this company, in 1950, she participated in the play &quot;Celos del aire&quot; with Manolo Fábregas and Carmen Montejo. That same year she represented &quot;Doña Inés&quot; in &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot;, co-starring with Jorge Mistral. The other plays from her early theatrical career are &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;, co-starring Prudencia Griffel, and &quot;El cuadrante de la Soledad&quot;, by José Revueltas, with sets by the artist Diego Rivera. In 1954, Pinal participated in the play &quot;La Sed&quot; with Ernesto Alonso and the Argentinean actor Pedro López Lagar. In 1955 she obtained recognition in the theater scene in the cast of &quot;Anna Christie&quot;, along with Wolf Ruvinskis. In 1957 Pinal staged the play &quot;Desnúdate, Lucrecia&quot;, in Chile, with Jorge Mistral, who eventually became a star of Mexican cinema.

In 1958, Pinal was responsible for producing Mexico&#x27;s first musical comedy, &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, directed by Luis de Llano Palmer. For this work, Pinal received an offer from Judy Holliday&#x27;s manager to work on Broadway, but Pinal refused to leave her career in Mexico. In 1964 she made the Mexican version of the musical &quot;Irma La Douce&quot;, alongside Julio Alemán and directed by Enrique Rambal. José Luis Ibáñez ended up becoming her head theater director. Under his direction, Pinal starred in the work &quot;Vidas privadas&quot;. One of her most notable works in musical comedy was the Mexican version of &quot;Mame&quot;, a successful Broadway musical. Thanks to her success, Pinal starred in three productions (1972, 1985, and 1989). In 1976 she also starred in the Mexican version of the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.

In 1977, to commemorate her twenty-five-year career anniversary, Pinal set up a cabaret show entitled &quot;¡Felicidades Silvia!.&quot; The show was presented with great success, first at the nightclub El Patio and then at the Teatro de la Ciudad in Mexico City. In 1978, she starred in the musical &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;. Her daughter Viridiana&#x27;s death truncated the theatrical project &quot;Agnes of God&quot;, in which both starred in 1982. In 1983, Pinal starred in and produced the Mexican montage of the work &quot;La señorita de Tacna&quot;, based on the work of Mario Vargas Llosa. In 1986, Pinal starred in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. In 1988, in association with Margarita López Portillo, Pinal acquired the Cine Estadio, located in Mexico City&#x27;s Colonia Roma, transforming it into a theatrical venue, the Teatro Silvia Pinal. The theater was opened in 1989 with the third production of the musical &quot;Mame&quot;, with Pinal at the head of the cast. Several problems caused Pinal to close the theater, which ceased production in 2000 and became a religious temple.

In 1992, Pinal acquired the former Cine Versailles, located in Colonia Juárez in Mexico City, and turned it into her second theater, the Diego Rivera Theater. This theater opened in 1991 with the production &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot;. In 1996, Pinal returned to musical theater with the second Mexican version of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, opposite Ignacio López Tarso. Pinal&#x27;s last work in theater was &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1998), starring alongside her daughter, singer Alejandra Guzmán. Pinal returned to the theater in 2005 with the play &quot;Debiera haber obispas&quot;, She participated in productions such as &quot;Adorables enemigas&quot; (2008) and &quot;Amor, dolor y lo que traía puesto&quot; (2012). In 2014, the Diego Rivera Theater changed its name to become the new Silvia Pinal Theatre.

She produced the Mexican versions of the musicals &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; (1989), &quot;Cats&quot; (1991) and &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1992).

===Television===

Pinal dabbled in television since its appearance in Mexico in the early 1950s. In 1952, she participated in a television show titled &quot;Con los brazos abiertos&quot;. Later, she participated in numerous telecasts by Luis de Llano Palmer, where Pinal introduced playback on Mexican television.

Pinal hosted &quot;Los Especiales de Silvia Pinal&quot;, a comedy-musical show on Televisa, in the mid-1960s. When Silvia married the actor and singer Enrique Guzmán, both produced and starred in the variety show &quot;Silvia y Enrique&quot;, which ran for four years (1968–1972). Once separated from Guzmán, Silvia continued her variety show titled &quot;¡Ahora Silvia!&quot;

In 1985, she became a producer and presenter of the &quot;Mujer, casos de la vida real&quot; TV show. Initially, the show was created to respond to cases and needs of the public and focused on locating victims of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. Over time, the show evolved to present current issues in daily life, including domestic violence, legal issues, and public health. This production was successful and lasted over 20 years. The program was canceled in 2007.

In 1968, Pinal debuted in telenovelas with the historical production &quot;Los Caudillos&quot;, inspired by the Mexican War of Independence. Ernesto Alonso produced the telenovela. Her second foray into the genre was with the telenovela &quot;¿Quién?&quot; (1973), produced by Guillermo Diazayas and based on a cartoon by Yolanda Vargas Dulché.

Eventually, Pinal decided to produce her telenovelas; her first hit was &quot;Mañana es primavera&quot; (1982), the last acting work of her daughter Viridiana before her death. In 1985, she also produced and starred in &quot;Eclipse&quot;. She also produced the melodramas &quot;Cuando los hijos se van&quot; (1983) and &quot;Tiempo de Amar&quot; (1987).

Her later appearances were as a special guest star in various telenovelas and television series. These included &quot;Carita de ángel&quot; (2000), in which she replaced actress Libertad Lamarque following her death, &quot;Fuego en la sangre&quot; (2008), &quot;Soy tu dueña&quot; (2010) and &quot;Mi marido tiene familia&quot; (2017). In 2009, Pinal performed in an episode of the series &quot;Mujeres asesinas&quot;.

===Politics===
Pinal became involved in politics after her fourth marriage, to the politician Tulio Hernández Gómez, governor of Tlaxcala. Between 1982 and 1987, Pinal was the first lady of that state. Eventually, she became a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and, in 1991, was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for Mexico City&#x27;s 27th district. In 1994 she was elected to the Assembly of Representatives of the Federal District, and from 1997 to 2000 she sat as a national-list senator. In those positions, her achievements included contributions to the Cinematographic Law to protect the rights of performers, her work on the Law of Condominiums and the Law of Tourism, tasks in favor of ecology, her promotion of the dissemination of theater books, and her fight against the Ministry of Finance to lower taxes on the theater.

Since the 1950s, Pinal actively participated in the trade union movement representing her country&#x27;s actors. In 1998 she became the leader of the National Association of Interpreters (ANDI) and, between 2010 and 2014, she served as general secretary of the National Association of Actors (ANDA).

Pinal had legal problems in 2000 due to conflicts with her management as the president of the Association of Theater Producers (Protea) in the early 1990s. For this reason, she lived in Miami, United States, for some time. After eleven months, the proceedings were vacated and she returned to Mexico.

To protect older actors, she founded the &quot;Asociación Rafael Banquells&quot;, in charge of providing non-profit help to performers. As president of the association, Pinal delivered the for highlights in music, film, theater, radio, television, dubbing and commercials during the year. The awards have been given annually since 1991.

==Personal life and death==

Pinal was married four times. Her first marriage was to Cuban actor and director Rafael Banquells in 1947. She acknowledged that her marriage at such an early age was partly to escape her repressive father: &quot;I changed my father for a softer one that stimulated me in my career.&quot; The couple divorced in 1952, a year after the birth of their daughter, Sylvia Pasquel, who later had a successful career as an actress.

Her second marriage was to the businessman and film producer Gustavo Alatriste. Pinal revealed on numerous occasions that Alatriste was the love of her life, a husband with whom she could have stayed forever. Pinal met Alatriste at a meeting at Ernesto Alonso&#x27;s house when he was about to divorce actress Ariadne Welter. It was thanks to Alatriste that Pinal was able to make her film projects with Luis Buñuel. The marriage ended in 1967 due to Alatriste&#x27;s infidelities and business problems between the couple. From her relationship with Alatriste, she had a daughter, actress (1963–1982). Viridiana died in a car accident in Mexico City in 1982 at the age of 19.

Her third marriage was to rock-and-roll singer and idol Enrique Guzmán. Pinal and Guzmán met when he was a guest on Pinal&#x27;s television show &quot;¡Ahora Silvia!&quot; They were married in 1967 despite some public resistance, as Pinal was 11 years older than her husband. Their marriage lasted nine years. They worked together and had two children: the singer Alejandra Guzmán (born 1968) and the musician and composer Luis Enrique Guzmán (born 1970).

Her last marriage was to the politician Tulio Hernández Gómez, at the time the governor of Tlaxcala. The couple married in 1982, and it was through Hernández that Pinal entered the world of politics. Pinal and Hernández divorced in 1995.

In addition to her marriages, at various times in her life, Pinal had multiple romances. In 1954, when filming &quot;Un extraño en la escalera&quot;, Pinal fell in love with her co-star, Arturo de Córdova. Other romances were with Mexican businessman Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, Egyptian actor Omar Sharif and American businessman Conrad Nicholson Hilton, Jr.

With time, Pinal became the head of one of Latin America&#x27;s most famous artistic dynasties. Her daughters Sylvia and Viridiana followed in her footsteps as actresses. Alejandra, her youngest daughter, is one of Mexico&#x27;s most popular singers. Alejandra&#x27;s daughter Frida Sofía is also a model living in Miami, United States. In addition, her granddaughter Stephanie Salas (daughter of Sylvia) has also forged a career as an actress and singer. Stephanie&#x27;s daughters, Michelle Salas and Camila Valero, are both models and actresses.

In November 2024, Pinal was hospitalized in Tlalpan, Mexico City, for a urinary tract infection. She died there on 28 November, at the age of 93. The Senate of the Republic observed a minute&#x27;s silence as a mark of respect, and the Secretariat of Culture organized a posthumous homage to the actress in the Palacio de Bellas Artes on 30 November. Her cremated ashes were placed at her family crypt, in the Panteón Jardín cemetery in San Ángel.

<text>Im Krapfenwald&#x27;l (In Krapfen&#x27;s Woods) op. 336 is a polka by Johann Strauss II written in 1869 and was originally titled &#x27;Im Pawlowsk Walde&#x27; (In the Pavlovsk Woods) when first performed in Pavlovsk on 6 September (= 25 August Russian calendar) 1869. Reportedly, several encores of the piece were called for and Strauss felt moved to retitled the piece to suit his audience back in native Vienna.

The new title &#x27;Im Krapfenwald&#x27;l&#x27; alludes to the popular Krapfenwald area of the Wienerwald located in the scenic village of Grinzing and the heights of Cobenzl and Kahlenberg. The piece may also refer to the owner of the local tavern &#x27;Krapfenwaldel&#x27;, Franz Josef Krapf who opened his establishment at the same area. Eduard Strauss, who was responsible for performing many of his elder brother&#x27;s works dating from his Russian tour first performed the work in Vienna at the Vienna Volksgarten on 24 June 1870 where it enjoyed greater admiration.

The work which hints strongly at the Viennese Woods backdrop calls for bird whistles which adorn the polka. Strauss has the last laugh when he calls for one of these birdsong in the closing moments of this cheerful work before a rushed ending with percussions and a flourish.

Felix Wong Yat-wah (born September 4, 1961) is a Hong Kong actor and singer best known for his performances in many &quot;wuxia&quot; television series produced by TVB, such as &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; (1983), in which he played the protagonist Kwok Ching. He is considered to be one of the most popular teen idols of the 1980s and was named as &quot;Third Tiger&quot; among Five Tiger Generals of TVB.

==Career==
Wong was recruited into TVB&#x27;s Artist Training Academy in September 1979, before his 18th birthday. While he was a trainee, he made cameo appearances in several dramas, such as &quot;The Bund&quot; (1980). After finish the secondary school in 1981, Wong was offered a major supporting role in &quot;The Misadventure of Zoo&quot; (1981), which starred Lydia Shum and Adam Cheng. Afterwards, Wong was immediately cast to play the male lead in &quot;The Lonely Hunter&quot; (1981), which subsequently propelled him to instant fame in Hong Kong. While the drama was airing, Wong received more fan letters than any other popular TVB actors and actresses at the time.

In the mid-1980s, Wong, along with Andy Lau, Tony Leung, Michael Miu and Kent Tong, were called the &quot;Five Tiger Generals of TVB&quot; and said to be the most popular male actors from TVB at that time. According to some polls conducted at the time, Wong had the largest fanbase.

Wong is perhaps best known for his role as the hero Kwok Ching in the 1983 television series &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot;, an adaptation of Louis Cha&#x27;s novel of the same title. Wong also starred in another two television adaptations of Cha&#x27;s novels, &quot;Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils&quot; (1982) and &quot;Sword Stained with Royal Blood&quot; (1986). Wong is also notable for his performance in &quot;Looking Back in Anger&quot; (1989), in which his character was involved in a love triangle with the characters played by Carina Lau and Kathy Chow. Besides playing the roles of the protagonists in most of his works, Wong has also achieved success for his portrayals of antagonists, such as the villain Lee Mat in &quot;The Grand Canal&quot; (1987), Jamukha in &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (1987), and recently as Stone Sir in &quot;Gun Metal Grey&quot; (2010).

In 1989, Wong left TVB after having completed filming &quot;Kim-mo Tuk-ku Kau-pai&quot;. He joined ATV and worked on four television series between 1990 and 1992. He also worked in the Taiwanese television drama &quot;Imperial Wanderer&quot; with Kathy Chow. Wong returned to TVB in 1993 and starred with Amy Chan in &quot;Racing Peak&quot;, a television series about a horse racing company. He left TVB again on 11 January 2002 to work on some mainland Chinese television series. Wong expressed his unhappiness with TVB in an interview, citing that as the reason for his departure. His last major project in TVB was &quot;Treasure Raiders&quot;, an adaptation of one of the works of Gu Long.

Wong starred in the 2005 film &quot;Wait &#x27;til You&#x27;re Older&quot; after being invited by Andy Lau. In July 2009, after filming &quot;Turning Point&quot;, Wong revealed that he will be working with Michael Miu in a new crime fiction television drama on TVB in October 2009 called &quot;Gun Metal Grey.&quot;

==Personal life==
Wong started dating fellow actress Leung Kit-wah in 1982 and they got married on December 7, 1988. They have a daughter, Adrian Wong Tsz-ching, on May 1, 1990. Leung died of organ failure at Gleneagles Hospital Hong Kong on May 26, 2020.
