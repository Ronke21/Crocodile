He made scores exceeding 60 in four consecutive matches and was ultimately named &quot;man of the series&quot;. Astle performed well in the subsequent series&#x27; such as the Singer-Akai Nidahas Trophy (1998) and the home series against South Africa accumulating close to 600 runs.

In the final match of the series, he made 119 off 116 balls that contained 21 fours. During the innings he was involved in a record stand of 193 for the first wicket with captain Stephen Fleming. It helped New Zealand win the series. In the rain-affected 2001–02 Trans-Tasman Trophy against Australia, Astle scored moderately in the first two Tests and came back with a valiant 156 not out in the third Test. Though New Zealand had their upper hand throughout the series, it ended in a draw. In the tour he made a career best First-class score of 223 against Queensland. Following that, England visited New Zealand to play five ODIs and three Test matches.

===2003 World Cup and return===
Astle made a remarkable comeback to the 2003 World Cup after disastrous performances in the previous two editions that appeared. He scored a century, second in World Cups, against Zimbabwe and finished the tournament with 213 runs from seven matches at an average of 42.60.
Immediately following the World Cup, New Zealand toured India to play two Test matches. In the first Test at Ahmedabad, Astle scored 103, when New Zealand were struggling thus helping them save the match. The following year Astle went on to record his highest ODI score when he made 145 not out against USA at the ICC Champions Trophy 2004. By this time, his Test average dipped down; he went on to make only two more hundreds till the end of his career, including one against Zimbabwe. However, he continued his good form in ODIs. In August 2005, he made an unbeaten 115 against India at the final of the Videocon Tri-Series that was held in Zimbabwe. New Zealand won the tournament and Astle was adjudged &quot;player of the match&quot;.

During the 2005 Chappell–Hadlee Series and the preceding tour to South Africa, Astle incurred media criticism along with fellow New Zealand cricket team teammates Craig McMillan, Hamish Marshall and James Marshall, for a slump in form. As a result of this, he was dropped from the national team. However he returned to the side in 2006 for the home series against West Indies. He scored 118 not out at Christchurch, and ended up as New Zealand&#x27;s leading run scorer of the tournament. Over the New Zealand summer, he scored 690 ODI runs from 11 matches at an average of 54.2.

<text>Jorge Carlos Vergara Madrigal (; 3 March 1955 – 15 November 2019) was a Mexican businessman and film producer. He was the founder of the multi-level marketing company Grupo Omnilife. In addition to its health products business, Grupo Omnilife owns the football club C.D. Guadalajara. Vergara was also owner of Costa Rican football team Saprissa (2003–2011) and Major League Soccer club Chivas USA (2004–2014).

Vergara produced internationally recognized films such as &quot;The Assassination of Richard Nixon&quot; and the Oscar-nominated &quot;Y Tu Mamá También&quot; through the production company, Producciones Anhelo.

Organized a cruise to Cuba for children affected by the terrorist attack at school No. 1 in Beslan in 2004.

== Career ==

=== Business ===
Born in Guadalajara, Vergara once sold tacos on Mexican streets. Back in the 1980s Vergara sold condominiums and timeshares in Manzanillo, Mexico, where he met and began working with John Peterson.

When Peterson became a Herbalife salesperson, he recruited Vergara and together they began selling Herbalife products in Mexico. Since Herbalife had not received Mexican government approval to sell their products, Peterson and Vergara had to smuggle the products into the country. After six months of smuggling the products into Mexico, Herbalife took notice and began the process of getting government approval. Vergara was asked to help get the Herbalife products approved by the Mexican government and was instrumental in helping Herbalife&#x27;s founder, Mark R. Hughes deal with the Mexican Government. This gave Vergara insight into how a multi-level company profits and expands into other countries. Vergara was partners with Roger Daley, Jim Fobair and Charlie Ragus. With already the 51% of the company, Vergara acquired the rest of Omnitrition at the end of the deal with his U.S. partners and took the whole control of Omnitrition de Mexico. Since its foundation in 1991, the privately owned corporation has grown from one company, Omnilife de Mexico, to comprise nineteen companies. Today, approximately 5.2 million people distribute Omnilife products in 22 countries, while the company has reached annual sales of nearly $4.2 billion.

Vergara was the director of Omnilife de Mexico from 1991 to his death.

=== Film ===
In 1999, Vergara met film director Alfonso Cuarón while seeking out filmmakers for his corporate movies. Cuarón, however, was more interested in filming &quot;Y Tu Mamá También&quot;, and gave Vergara the screenplay. A known lover of films, Vergara read it and right away proposed that they begin production. In the process they established a production company Producciones Anhelo that would go on to co-produce Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Backbone&quot;, along with Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s El Deseo and del Toro&#x27;s Tequila Gang. Anhelo also produced Sebastián Cordero&#x27;s &quot;Crónicas&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Variety&quot; named Vergara one of its Ten Producers to Watch. For the 2004 edition of the Guadalajara International Film Festival, Vergara created the JVC Award for Best Director, which was given to Fernando Eimbcke for his feature debut &quot;Temporada de patos&quot;.

=== Chivas ===
Vergara gained ownership of the football team C.D. Guadalajara (popularly known as &quot;Chivas&quot;) in 2002. Shortly after he took ownership in Mexico, while attending the 2004 U.S. Major League Soccer All-Star Game, he announced intentions to expand Chivas to MLS.

Vergara and MLS inaugurated Chivas USA in 2004, and the team played its first official season in 2005 with Home Depot Center in the Los Angeles area as its home stadium. Chivas USA was initially successful; in its first five seasons of operation, the team recorded four straight MLS playoff appearances. Both performance and attendance declined sharply after 2009.

On 20 February 2014, Major League Soccer purchased Chivas USA from Vergara. They announced plans to sell to a buyer dedicated to keeping the club in Los Angeles, as well as a plan to rebrand the club. After being unable to find a buyer, the club folded following the 2014 season. A new club, Los Angeles FC, was founded in 2018, but with no connection to the former Chivas USA club.

== Personal life ==
Vergara had six children.

Vergara and Rossana Lerdo de Tejada were married 10 June 2017 in Guadalajara, Mexico. Lerdo de Tejada is his widow.

== Death ==
Vergara died on 15 November 2019 at the age of 64 in New York City as a result of a cardiac arrest.

<doc id="1300440" wikidata="Q296975" url="?curid=1300440" title="Iván Helguera">
<text>Iván Helguera Bujía (; born 28 March 1975) is a Spanish former professional footballer.

Playing as either a central defender or defensive midfielder, with both good defensive and offensive skills, he represented five clubs during his professional career, notably Real Madrid – achieving team success as an important player – and Valencia. In his early 20s, he also had an unassuming abroad spell with Roma, going on to amass La Liga totals of 291 games and 21 goals over 11 seasons.

A Spanish international on nearly 50 occasions, Helguera represented the country at the 2002 World Cup and in two European Championships.

==Club career==
===Early career and Real Madrid===
Born and raised in Santander, Cantabria and brought up at local Racing Club, Helguera started playing professionally for Manchego CF and Albacete Balompié, appearing in 14 Segunda División games in the 1996–97 season for the latter. He was purchased by Serie A side AS Roma after that, alongside compatriot César Gómez, but left after one disappointing campaign to join RCD Espanyol, where his stellar performances as a defender under coach Marcelo Bielsa led to a Real Madrid deal even before 1998–99 had finished.

With Real Madrid from July 1999, Helguera was an instant first choice, and scored five and six La Liga goals in his second and fourth seasons (both ended with the national championship conquest) alternating between defender and midfielder. He was also instrumental in the capital team&#x27;s two UEFA Champions League conquests: in the 2000 final, against fellow Spaniards Valencia CF, he started the match as a sweeper in a 3–0 win, appearing as stopper two years later in the 2–1 victory over Bayer 04 Leverkusen.

Not a starter in his final two years, Helguera still made a total of 42 appearances, scoring in a 3–1 away defeat of Gimnàstic de Tarragona on 28 October 2006. At the start of his last season he was surprisingly stripped of his No. 6 jersey which went to new signing Mahamadou Diarra, given No. 21 and made to train with the youth team in anticipation of his leaving the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, even though his contract ran until June 2009. However, he later managed to fight his way back into the starting eleven, being somewhat influential in helping the club to the 2007 domestic league.

===Valencia===
On 20 July 2007, Helguera signed for Valencia on a three-year deal – upon joining, he stated that he had wanted to come to Valencia for a &quot;long time&quot; and was &quot;delighted&quot; to arrive at the club. He was relatively important during his debut campaign, also helping the &quot;Che&quot; to win the Copa del Rey.

However, after having appeared very rarely in the first part of the following season, Helguera&#x27;s contract was cancelled on 12 December 2008, and both FC Dinamo București and Los Angeles Galaxy declared interest in signing the player, but nothing came of it and he retired from football later that year.

==International career==
Helguera was capped 47 times for Spain, the first coming on 18 November 1998 in an away friendly with Italy (2–2). He played for his country at UEFA Euro 2000, the 2002 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2004, missing the 2006 World Cup after being omitted from the squad in the months before the tournament by national team coach Luis Aragonés.

==Personal life==
Helguera&#x27;s younger brother, Luis, was also a professional footballer. A midfielder, he played in the first division for Real Zaragoza and Deportivo Alavés, and also in Italy.

He married his longtime girlfriend Lorena, and welcomed his first baby, a boy named Luca, on 30 November 2005.

<doc id="1300441" wikidata="Q3867049" url="?curid=1300441" title="Multiflow">
<text>Multiflow Computer, Inc., founded in April, 1984 near New Haven, Connecticut, USA, was a manufacturer and seller of minisupercomputer hardware and software embodying the VLIW design style. Multiflow, incorporated in Delaware, ended operations in March, 1990, after selling about 125 VLIW minisupercomputers in the United States, Europe, and Japan.

While Multiflow&#x27;s commercial success was small and short-lived, its technical success and the dissemination of its technology and people had a great effect on the future of computer science and the computer industry. Multiflow&#x27;s computers were arguably the most novel ever to be broadly sold, programmed, and used like conventional computers. (Other novel computers either required novel programming, or represented more incremental steps beyond existing computers.)

Along with Cydrome, an attached-VLIW minisupercomputer company that had less commercial success, Multiflow demonstrated that the VLIW design style was practical, a conclusion surprising to many. While still controversial, VLIW has since been a force in high-performance embedded systems, and has been finding slow acceptance in general-purpose computing.

==Early history==
===Technology roots===
The VLIW (for Very Long Instruction Word) design style was first proposed by Joseph A. (Josh) Fisher, a Yale University computer science professor, during the period 1979-1981. VLIW was motivated by a compiler scheduling technique, called trace scheduling, that Fisher had developed as a graduate student at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University in 1978. Trace scheduling, unlike any prior compiler technique, exposed significant quantities of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) in ordinary computer programs, without laborious hand coding. This implied the practicality of processors for which the compiler could be relied upon to find and specify ILP.

VLIW was put forward by Fisher as a way to build general-purpose instruction-level parallel processors exploiting ILP to a degree that would have been impractical using what would later be called superscalar control hardware. Instead, the compiler could, in advance, arrange the ILP to be carried out nearly in lock-step by the hardware, commanded by long instructions or a similar mechanism. While there had previously been processors that achieved significant amounts of ILP, they had all relied upon code laboriously hand-parallelized by the user, or upon library routines, and thus were not general-purpose computers and did not fit the VLIW paradigm.

The practicality of trace scheduling was demonstrated by a compiler built at Yale by Fisher and three of his graduate students, John Ruttenberg, Alexandru Nicolau, and especially John Ellis, whose doctoral dissertation on the compiler won the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award in 1985. Encouraged by their compiling progress, Fisher&#x27;s group started an architecture and hardware design effort called the ELI (Enormously Long Instructions) Project.

===Business beginnings===
ELI, which was to have 512-bit instruction words and initiate 10-30 RISC operations per cycle, was never built. Instead, Fisher, Ruttenberg, and John O&#x27;Donnell, who had led the ELI hardware project, started Multiflow in 1984 after failing to interest any mainstream computer companies in partnering in the ELI project. Originally, Multiflow was to have become a division of the workstation company Apollo Computer, but eventually it sought venture capital funding, closing its first round of financing in January, 1985, when the company already had about 20 employees. Donald E. Eckdahl, a former head of the NCR computer division, joined the company in 1985 as its CEO.

Multiflow delivered its first working VLIW minisupercomputers in early 1987 to three beta-sites: Grumman Aircraft, Sikorsky Helicopter, and the Supercomputer Research Center. A Trace 14/200 was demonstrated to the public at a supercomputing conference in May, 1987, in Santa Clara, California.

==Technology==
===Innovative architecture===
Multiflow&#x27;s first computers were called the Trace 7/200 and Trace 14/200. The 7/ in the computer model number signified that the processor could initiate seven operations each cycle, using a 256-bit long instruction composed of 7 32-bit operations and a 32-bit utility field. The seven operations were four integer/memory, two floating, and a branch. The 14/ models had twice as many of each instruction, and thus 512-bit long instruction words. Like many scientific-oriented processors of its day, the Trace had no traditional cache memory.

Multiflow also announced a 28/ model at the outset, and eventually these were built and sold to a few customers. The 28/ had 1024-bit instruction words. Having ordinary programs compiled for computers like these was unquestionably revolutionary, as no earlier computer had offered compiled ILP even like that of the 7/ models. The 28/ systems pushed these limits far beyond either academic or industrial conception. While only a few customer programs contained enough ILP to keep a 28/ busy, when they did the performance was remarkable, since the processor would then initiate close to all 28 operations on average.

===Hardware===
Each 7/ processor datapath comprised a control unit board, an integer ALU board, and a floating point board. The 14/ added a second integer ALU board and a second floating point board. Before many systems were in the field, faster 3rd party floating-point chips became available, and the /200 family was replaced by the object-code incompatible 7/300 and 14/300, and the 14/300 became by far the company&#x27;s most popular model. In about 1988, a /100 entry level series was introduced as well, but these were essentially /300 systems with a slower clock. All the processors were built using CMOS gate arrays for the integer ALUs and registers, 3rd-party floating point chips, and medium-scale integrated circuits for the control and other portions.

In 1988, the company started development of an ECL /500 family, which was to feature a 14/ that could also be used as a multiprocessor of two 7/ models, but that system was not completed before the company ceased operations.

One example Trace system is in storage at the Computer History Museum.

===Innovative software===
Multiflow also produced the software tools for the systems it built. The systems ran Berkeley Unix. Probably, at the time the Multiflow systems were delivered, no computer that issued instructions longer than a single operation at a time had ever run a compiled mainstream operating system. Yet the entire Unix operating system and the usual tools all ran, with the usual portions compiled, on all the company&#x27;s models.

The compiler was particularly noteworthy, as could be expected given Multiflow&#x27;s technology. The company built a new compiler, in a similar style to that developed at Yale, but industrial-strength and with the incorporation of much commercially-necessary capability. In addition to implementing aggressive trace scheduling, it was known for its reliability, for its incorporation of state-of-the-art optimization, and for its ability to handle simultaneously many different language variants and all of the different object-code incompatible models of the Multiflow Traces. (While code from a 7/X00 could run correctly on a 14/X00, the nature of the architecture mandated that it would have to be recompiled to run faster than it did on the 7/.)

The compiler was generating correct code by 1985, and by 1987 it was producing code that found significant amounts of ILP. After 1987, with the press of customers and prospects, its development emphasized features and functionality, though performance-oriented improvement continued.

The compiler was so robust, and so good at exposing ILP independent of the system it was targeted for, that after Multiflow closed, the compiler was licensed by many of the largest computer companies. It has been reported that this included Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment Corporation, Fujitsu, Hughes, HAL Computer Systems, and Silicon Graphics. Other companies known to have licensed the technology include Equator Technologies, Hitachi and NEC. Compilers built starting from that code base were used for advanced development and benchmark reporting for the most important superscalar processors of the 1990s. Descendants of the compiler were still in wide use 20 years after it first started generating correct code (notably, Intel&#x27;s icc &quot;Proton&quot; compiler and the NEC Earth Simulator compiler), and are often used as benchmark targets for new compiler development. MIT and the University of Washington are among the universities that received and used the compiler for advanced research purposes.

The Multiflow compiler was written in C. It pre-dated the popular use of C++ (Multiflow was a beta-site for the language). The compiler designers were strong believers in the object-oriented paradigm, however, and the compiler had a rather idiosyncratic style that encapsulated the structures and operations in it. This caused a steep learning curve for the many developers who used it after Multiflow&#x27;s demise, but one that was usually considered a good investment because of the unique combination of ambitious compiling and rock-solid engineering the compiler offered.

==Customers and business history==
===Customers===
While a few of Multiflow&#x27;s sales went to organizations wishing to learn more about the new VLIW design style, most systems were used for simulation in product development environments: mechanical, aerodynamic, defense, crash dynamics, chemical, and some electronic. Customers ranged from a major metropolitan air-quality board to a major consumer detergent, food and sundries company, along with the expected heavy industry companies, research laboratories and universities. In 1987, GEI Rechnersysteme GmbH, a division of Daimler-Benz, began distributing Traces in Germany with great success, despite fierce competition from other minisupercomputer companies. In the following three years, Multiflow opened offices or had distributors in most of Western Europe and Japan, and opened offices in many US metropolitan areas.

===Multiflow&#x27;s end===
Multiflow ended operations on March 27, 1990, two days after a large deal contemplated with Digital Equipment Corporation came apart. At that point, the board determined that the prospects for successful additional financing, in the amounts necessary to bring Multiflow to maturity, were too unlikely to justify the company&#x27;s continuation. Multiflow&#x27;s failure is often blamed anecdotally on “good technology, but bad marketing,” on “good software, but slow, conservative hardware,” on some property of its innovative technology, or even on the isolated location of its headquarters. The more likely cause was that its business plan was incompatible with seismic shifts in the computer industry. Building a full-scale, general-purpose computer company seemed to require many hundreds of millions of dollars (US) by 1990. But the killer micro revolution meant there would be a steady march of ever faster and cheaper competition. The economies inherent in microprocessors were inaccessible to startups in general, and incompatible with VLIWs, which would have required too much silicon for the densities of the time. (The first VLIW microprocessor was the Philips Life, the ancestor of today&#x27;s TriMedia, delivered several years later.) Since the founding of Sun and SGI in the early 1980s, no new general-purpose computer company has succeeded without building computers for which there was an existing large software base, and none of the many minisupercomputer startup companies of the 1980s eventually succeeded.

===Corporate culture===
Multiflow was staffed by engineers, computer scientists, and other computer professionals who were attracted to the combination of a novel and challenging technology, an uphill battle, and the remarkable social experience of working in the most uniformly talented group they were ever likely to be a part of. The system was so novel that its engineering was widely expected to fail. Despite that, even though none of the employees (besides Eckdahl) had ever held senior engineering positions, Trace systems and their software were delivered on time, were robust, and exceeded their promised performance. In great part this was due to the talent level of those attracted to the company, and to the tremendous learning environment it was from the outset.

Following Multiflow&#x27;s closing, its employees went on to have a widespread effect on the industry. The small core group of engineers and scientists, numbering about 20, produced four fellows in major American computer companies (two of whom were Eckert-Mauchly Award winners), several founders of successful startups, and leaders of major development efforts at large companies. The only nontechnical person in the core group, hired out of business school, went on to lead corporate development at a major research lab. As Multiflow grew, it continued the tradition of hiring highly talented people: as one example, the documentation writer became one of the most influential editors in computer publishing. Multiflow&#x27;s effect on the computer industry was very much its people in addition to its technology.

<text>Scouse is a type of stew typically made from chunks of meat (usually beef or lamb) with potatoes, carrots, and onion. It is particularly associated with the port of Liverpool; hence, the inhabitants of that city are often referred to as &quot;scousers&quot;.
The word &quot;scouse&quot; comes from &quot;lobscouse&quot;, a stew commonly eaten by sailors throughout northern Europe in the past, and surviving in different forms there today.

==Description==
Scouse is particularly associated with the port of Liverpool. The recipe for scouse is fairly broad; it was traditionally made from leftovers and whatever was in season. &quot;Guardian&quot; food writer Felicity Cloake describes scouse as being similar to Irish stew or Lancashire hotpot, though generally using beef rather than lamb as the meat. While ingredients can vary, those essentials are potatoes, carrots, onions, and chunks of meat, with beef favoured over lamb. These are simmered together for several hours. The meat may be seared first, then reserved while some of the potatoes are boiled; as they break up, thickening the mix, the meat and the rest of the potatoes are added, and the stew finished off.

A survey by &quot;The Liverpool Echo&quot; in 2018 confirmed that for the majority of cooks the basic ingredients are potatoes, carrots, onion and chunks of meat, though many advocated the addition of a stock cube, and a few also added other ingredients, such as peas, lentils or sweet potato, and herbs including rosemary, parsley and basil. The choice of meat varied: some cooks did not stipulate a particular meat; among those who did, beef was chosen rather than lamb by a majority of nearly two to one.
Although some argue that anything other than beef, potatoes, carrots, onion is not scouse, others point out that, as a thrift dish, it will contain &quot;whatever veg you had... and...the cheapest cuts of meat&quot;. Some recipes suggest including marrowbones to thicken the stew. Proportions vary from equal amounts of meat and vegetables to a 1:5 proportion between meat and potato. A meatless version, known as &quot;blind scouse&quot;, is also recorded, for vegetarians, or when people were too poor to afford meat. Scouse is generally served with pickled red cabbage or beetroot and crusty bread.

==Origin ==
Scouse is strongly associated with the port of Liverpool and its hinterland in the northwest of England. Other parts of the country were slower to begin growing potatoes, but they were cultivated in Lancashire from the late 17th century onwards. By the late 18th century the potato-based lobscouse – by then also known simply as scouse – had become a traditional dish of the region. A 1797 description records that potatoes were &quot;peeled, or rather scraped, raw; chopped, and boiled together with a small quantity of meat cut into very small pieces. The whole of this mixture is then formed into a hash, with pepper, salt, onions, etc., and forms a cheap and nutritive dish&quot;. An earlier reference from 1785 refers to &quot;LOBS-COUSE, a dish much eaten at sea, composed of salt beef,&quot; [ship&#x27;s] &quot;biscuit&quot;&quot;, and onions, well peppered and stewed together.&quot; The same recipe was used by nineteenth-century sailors. In the poorest areas of Liverpool, when funds ran too low for the purchase of even the cheapest cuts of meat, &quot;blind scouse&quot; would be made, using only vegetables.

Similar dishes are traditional in countries around the North Sea, such as Norway (&quot;lapskaus&quot;), Sweden (&quot;lapskojs&quot;), Finland (&quot;lapskoussi&quot;), Denmark, (&quot;skipperlabskovs&quot;), and northern Germany (&quot;Labskaus&quot;), though these differ from the original lobscouse and from each other. Swedish &quot;Lapskojs&quot; and Norwegian &quot;Lapskaus&quot; is a stew, like scouse, while German &quot;Labskaus&quot; is a form of hash. However, lobscouse is also different from scouse, being a type of gruel.

==Origin of name==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) states that &quot;scouse&quot; is a shortened form of &quot;lobscouse&quot; a sailors dish from the 18th century, and has also been written as &quot;lopscourse&quot;, &quot;lobscourse&quot;, &quot;lobskous&quot;, &quot;lobscouce&quot;, and &quot;lap&#x27;s course&quot;.

Its oldest reference in the OED is from 1707, by the satirist Edward Ward: &quot;He has sent the Fellow ... to the Devil, that first invented Lobscouse.&quot;

The first known use of the term &quot;lobscouse&quot; is dated 1706, according to &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. Tobias Smollett refers to &quot;lob&#x27;s course&quot; in 1750. The roots of the word are unknown. The &quot;OED&quot; states that the origin is unknown, and goes on to compare the word to &quot;loblolly&quot;, which means a &quot;thick gruel or spoon-meat, frequently referred to as a rustic or nautical dish or simple medicinal remedy; burgoo&quot; and &quot;perhaps [is] onomatopoeic: compare the dialectal lob &#x27;to bubble while in process of boiling, said esp. of porridge&#x27;, also &#x27;to eat or drink up noisily&#x27;&quot;.

According to &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, lobscouse &quot;almost certainly has its origins in the Baltic ports, especially those of Germany&quot;, although it offers no evidence to support this assertion. The claim is repeated in a number of sources, though again, no reason given for this belief. Contrariwise, Crowley points out that lobscouse (as &quot;lobs course&quot;) is mentioned by Smollett in 1750, while Friedrich Kluge dates its first appearance in German in 1878, and concludes the usage spread from Britain to northern Europe rather than vice versa.

Kluge also states that the origin of lobscouse is unknown, and that it was loaned to German in the 19th century, where it was called &quot;labskaus&quot;. Hjalmar Falk and Alf Torp states that &quot;lobscous&quot; originally was &quot;lob&#x27;s course&quot; from a lob (a lump) and course (a dish) and that the word has travelled to Norwegian as &quot;lapskaus&quot; and Danish as &quot;lobskous&quot;.

The similarities with &quot;labs kauss&quot; in Latvian and &quot;labas kaušas&quot; in Lithuanian is called gobbledygook (&quot;Kauderwelsch&quot;) of the mind in Der Spiegel by Petra Foede. Foede translates &quot;Labs kausis&quot; to means a &quot;good plate&quot; in Latvian, and says that in Lithuanian they use &quot;labas káuszas&quot; for a &quot;good plate&quot;. According to Gerhard Bauer &quot;káuszas&quot; in Lithuanian means a wooden ladle or dipper or a wooden drinking bowl and is the same word as Lettish &quot;kauśis&quot; and this Baltic word has been adopted in German as &quot;Kausche&quot; or &quot;Kauszel&quot; which means wooden jug, pitcher or drinking bowl.

 claims that Labskaus stems from a combination of &quot;Lappen, Lappenstücke&quot; or &quot;&quot; from the pig and a Low German word &quot;Kaus&quot; which he explains as a plate or platter and concludes that Labskaus is a paraphrase for a plate of minced pork. Reich does not cite any sources to his claim.

==Global Scouse Day==
Since 2000 there has been an annual International or Global Scouse Day held, where bars, cafes and restaurants in Liverpool and around the world put scouse on the menu for the day, raising funds for charities.

==Variations==
Lobscouse is also remembered in other parts of the northwest. In the Potteries, a similar stew is known as &quot;lobby&quot;,
and people from Leigh, Greater Manchester, are known as &quot;lobby-gobblers&quot;.
In North Wales the full form is retained as &quot;lobsgows&quot; (Welsh: &quot;lapsgóws&quot;)

A version of scouse has been known on the Atlantic coast of Canada in Newfoundland and Labrador, from at least 1792. It is described as a sea dish of minced and salted beef, crumbled sea biscuit, potatoes and onions.

<text>The fishing vessel Gaul was a deep sea factory ship based at Hull, United Kingdom. She was launched in December 1971 by Brooke Marine of Lowestoft, entering service during 1972 with the Ranger Fishing company, where she was registered at North Shields as &quot;Ranger Castor&quot;, SN18. She was renamed when Ranger Fishing was bought by British United Trawlers and re-registered at Hull as &quot;Gaul&quot;, H243. She sank some time on the night of 8–9 February 1974 in storm conditions in the Barents Sea, north of Norway. No distress signal was received and her loss was not realised until 10 February after she twice failed to report in. An extensive search operation was launched but no trace of the ship was found, apart from a lifebuoy recovered three months later. All thirty-six crew were lost. The president of the British Trawler Federation described the loss of the &quot;Gaul&quot; as &quot;the worst ever single-trawler tragedy&quot;. The wreck was finally located in 1997.

== Final voyage ==
&quot;Gaul&quot; sailed from Hull on the morning of 22 January 1974. Mate George Petty became ill and was put ashore at Lødingen on the 26th. Maurice Spurgeon joined the crew on the 28th at Tromsø and &quot;Gaul&quot; arrived at the fishing grounds off the north coast of Norway the following day. On 8 February the sea state became severe. Reports from the skippers of other trawlers in the area give the wave height at between 6.5 and 9m, wind between 7 and 10 on the Beaufort scale.

At 09:30 &quot;Gaul&quot; reported to British United Trawlers that she was &quot;laid and dodging off the North Cape Bank&quot;. At 10:30, as was company policy, she reported to the &quot;Orsino&quot; on the &quot;Skipper&#x27;s Freezer Schedule&quot; – a summary of position, weather conditions, catch etcetera. A further report was due at 16:30 but &quot;Gaul&quot;, alone of the 17 British United Trawlers ships in the area at the time, failed to report.

By the afternoon of 10 February British United Trawlers had alerted their insurance company, UK Trawlers Mutual that &quot;Gaul&quot; had failed to report for two days. On the following morning the insurance company sent out a message to all the trawlers they insured reading 

The aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; was in the area and was ordered to commence searching. The search involved four other British ships, three Norwegian ships and 19 trawlers, coordinated by the &quot;Hermes&quot;. No evidence of the missing &quot;Gaul&quot; was found and the search was called off on the afternoon of 15 February.

== The 1970s Formal Investigation ==
The original Formal Investigation in 1974 concluded that the most likely reason for her loss was that she was overwhelmed by a succession of very large waves in heavy seas and capsized. The preliminary investigation had also found deficiencies in the maintenance of chutes, doors and hatches on &quot;Gaul&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Kurd&quot;, but the relevance of this fact was downplayed at the formal inquiry.

&quot;Gaul&quot; was one of the most modern ships in the UK fishing fleet — she was only 18 months old — and relatives of the crew were reluctant to accept the investigation findings.

In 1975 a TV programme claimed she had been sunk while engaging in espionage and over the years other theories, including conspiracy theories, have been advanced:

* She was captured and interned by the Soviet Union because she was engaged in espionage.
* She was sunk by a Soviet submarine for the same reason.
* She collided with a submarine engaged in clandestine operations.
* She was dragged under after snagging her trawling gear in secret undersea cables (SOSUS).

== The wreck is found ==
In 1975 the Norwegian trawler &quot;Rairo&quot; reported snagging her nets on an undersea obstruction in the area where the &quot;Gaul&quot; was lost. In 1977, however, the UK government decided against launching a search based on this (and other similar) information, despite being confident that this was indeed &quot;Gaul&quot;. It was argued that such an investigation would add little new information in aid of safety at sea to justify the cost.

In 1997 a TV crew, with help from Norwegian experts located the wreck exactly where &quot;Rairo&quot; had reported the snagging of her nets. She was discovered to be located some off the northern coast of Norway and lying in of water.

This prompted UK Deputy Prime Minister (and Hull MP) John Prescott to ask the Marine Accident Investigation Branch of the Department for Transport to carry out extensive surveys of the wreck, which it did in 1998 and 2002. During the latter part of the underwater survey in 2002, samples of bones and other human remains were recovered from the wreck, DNA tests conducted by the Forensic Science Service established that the remains came from four of the Gaul&#x27;s crew. This finding quelled suspicions that the crew had been taken from the vessel by the Russians during cold war hostilities. After reviewing the factual evidence gained from the underwater surveys, the MAIB concluded that there was enough new evidence to warrant a new formal inquiry. The surveys revealed that some of &quot;Gaul&quot;″s hatches and doors were open and, specifically, the outer non-return flaps and the inner covers to the duff and offal waste chutes were open. Additionally, the inner cover to the duff chute appeared to be secured open and the ship&#x27;s steering gear (a steerable kort nozzle) was found to show between 10° and 15° of port helm. John Prescott concurred with the MAIB and a new investigation was launched (the 2004 Re-opened Formal Investigation (RFI)).

== 2004 inquiry ==
On 17 December 2004 the RFI concluded that these open chutes, doors and hatches had compromised the ship&#x27;s watertight integrity and, combined with a following (and as already noted) heavy sea led to flooding on the factory deck. The RFI also postulated that an attempted emergency manoeuvre by the &quot;Gaul&quot;″s officer of the watch (a perfectly logical move to try to turn &#x27;into the sea&#x27;) caused 100 tonnes of floodwater to surge across to the starboard side of the ship leading to capsize and a catastrophic loss of stability. Further flooding then took place through open doors, chutes and hatches until the &quot;Gaul&quot; lost her reserves of buoyancy, she then sank very rapidly, stern first.

The report of the RFI dismissed the notion that &quot;Gaul&quot; was involved in espionage or that she was in a collision. It found that she was not fishing at the time of her loss, which indicated that no snagging (of the nets) could have occurred. Regarding espionage the report did include, verbatim, the following submission from Commander Clark RN: &quot;Skippers, radio officers and Mates of trawlers were involved in the low level observation and photography of Soviet vessels and aircraft and passive listening. This was on both a voluntary and an opportunity basis. General records and press cuttings on file indicate that some 30 to 40 Skippers were involved in the 1960s when this activity was at its peak. No records of trawler personnel involved in this activity exist in MOD files...However this type of intelligence gathering declined in the early 1970s. I have seen nothing to indicate that the crew of the FV GAUL were involved in this type of activity.&quot; 

The commissioner for wrecks, Mr Justice Steel, told the inquiry that the 1974/5 inquiry had been inadequate and that it had been an &quot;open secret&quot; that the trawler had been involved in spying.

In the immediate wake of the report, relatives of the crew said they were not satisfied and claimed that the &quot;truth was still to be told&quot;.

== Memorial service ==
In February 2014, a memorial service was held on St. Andrew&#x27;s Quay, Hull, to mark the 40th anniversary of the loss of the &quot;Gaul&quot;.

In 2024 there will be a multitude of different events held in Hull, from 8 to 15 February, in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of The &quot;Gaul&quot;.

== Notes ==
* &quot;Gaul&quot; was one of four ships in her class. the others were &quot;Kurd&quot;, &quot;Kelt&quot; and &quot;Arab&quot; (later &quot;Kappin&quot;).
* She was a stern trawler, meaning that the nets were cast off of the back of the ship (rather than the side, as with a sidewinder trawler) 
* She was a filleter-freezer factory ship and processed fish, as well as catching it. This means she effectively had two crews, the &#x27;sailing&#x27; crew and the factory crew. The Reopened Formal Investigation noted this as a potential risk factor if the factory crew were not fully conversant with the safe operation of &quot;Gaul&quot;.
* The report claimed that the skipper and Mate, although experienced mariners, had never sailed in a ship of &quot;Gaul&quot;&#x27;s class, specifically ships with separate factory crew.
* The chutes at the centre of the RFI&#x27;s conclusions were the &quot;duff&quot; and &quot;offal&quot; chutes, used to dispose of unwanted marine organisms and fish processing waste respectively. The Wreck Commissioner, Mr Justice Steel, said of the poor condition of these chutes: &quot;This reflects poorly on the maintenance and repair work performed by the owners and their staff.&quot;
*The inquiry secured for the first time official confirmation that the UK government used trawlers for espionage during the Cold War, but found no evidence that &quot;Gaul&quot; was – or had ever been – so used.
*In 2010 an independent and critical investigation was carried out into the &quot;Gaul&quot;&#x27;s reserves of operational stability, the results of which revealed that she did not meet the IMCO (now IMO) minimum stability standards in all of her anticipated seagoing conditions.

<text>PA Media (formerly the Press Association) is a multimedia news agency. It is part of PA Media Group Limited, a private company with 26 shareholders, most of whom are national and regional newspaper publishers. The biggest shareholders include the Daily Mail and General Trust, News UK, and Informa. 

PA Media Group also encompasses Globelynx, which provides TV-ready remotely monitored camera systems for corporate clients to connect with TV news broadcasters in the UK and worldwide; TNR, a specialist communications consultancy; Sticky, a digital copywriting and content strategy agency; and StreamAMG, a video streaming business. The group&#x27;s photography arm, PA Images, has a portfolio comprising more than 20 million photographs online and around 10 million in physical archives dating back 150 years.

==History==
Founded in 1868 by a group of provincial newspaper proprietors, the PA provides a London-based service of news-collecting and reporting from around the United Kingdom. The news agency&#x27;s founders sought to produce a more accurate and reliable alternative to the monopoly service of the telegraph companies.

In January 1870 the agency moved from temporary offices into new headquarters at 7 Wine Office Court, off Fleet Street. At 5am on Saturday 5 February 1870, its first press telegram was transmitted. The agency&#x27;s first Editor-in-Chief was Arthur Cranfield, appointed in 1926.

In 1995, PA moved from Fleet Street to Vauxhall Bridge Road, enabling the company to rapidly expand its output particularly in the sports and new media divisions.

The Press Association launched the Ananova news website in 2000. Ananova was then sold to Orange.

In 2005, the company changed its name to PA Group.

In December 2013, PA Group sold its weather business MeteoGroup, Europe&#x27;s largest private sector weather company, to global growth investment firm General Atlantic.

In February 2015, PA announced the sale of its finance publications divisions, which included TelecomFinance and SatelliteFinance.

In September 2018 it was announced that the news agency was renamed from Press Association to PA Media, and the umbrella company from PA Group Limited to PA Media Group Limited. This coincided with a move from their Vauxhall Bridge Road offices to a new space that would accommodate the move toward digital media.

The editor-in-chief of the news agency is Pete Clifton, who was appointed in October 2014.

In June 2024, the Central Arbitration Committee forced PA to recognize the National Union of Journalists as the official union representing PA&#x27;s editorial employees. As of May, the bargaining unit was composed of 274 workers.

==Other divisions and ventures==
===PA Training===

PA Training is Europe&#x27;s biggest journalism and media training company. It was formed in 2006, when the Press Association acquired Trinity Mirror&#x27;s training centre in Newcastle upon Tyne. The NCTJ course in Newcastle has been around since 1969.

The business already owned the former Westminster Press-owned Editorial Centre and merged the two businesses to become PA Training.

===Alamy===

Alamy, a global stock photo agency with over 125 million images, was wholly acquired by PA Media in February 2020. The purchase enables PA Media to enter the international stock photography market.

===Other subsidiaries===
Other subsidiaries include Globelynx, founded in 2001; Sticky Content, acquired in full between 2013 and 2015; StreamAMG (Advanced Media Group), acquired in April 2017; and RADAR, founded in 2017.

<doc id="1300462" wikidata="Q4932376" url="?curid=1300462" title="Bob Enyart">
<text>Robert Enyart (January 10, 1959September 12, 2021) was an American conservative talk radio host and pastor of Denver Bible Church in Denver, Colorado. He was an anti-abortion advocate and political commentator. Enyart opposed mandated vaccinations and mask mandates for COVID-19. He died of COVID-19 in September 2021.

==Early life and education==
Enyart was born and raised in Paterson, New Jersey. He attended a Catholic grammar school for eight years before attending a public high school. Enyart studied at Arizona State University at Tempe, where he specialized in computer science.

==Career==
Before graduating from college, Enyart began working in the technology industry, including positions at McDonnell Douglas and US West in Denver. He designed computer software for military helicopters and served as a computer analyst for Microsoft.

Opposed to legal abortion, Enyart began working for Operation Rescue in 1989; multiple arrests for trespassing, assault and obstruction at women&#x27;s clinics led to conviction, and Enyart spent time in jail.

In 1991, Enyart began broadcasting about conservative issues at KQXI. With his audience growing, he began broadcasting on Christian television station KWHD-TV, owned by LeSea Broadcasting of South Bend, Indiana.

In 2000, Enyart became pastor at Denver Bible Church.

Enyart hosted &quot;Bob Enyart Live,&quot; a daily show on Denver-based Christian radio station KLTT and was a host for Cornerstone Television.

In 1991, Enyart created a radio show to support creationism and attack evolution. Enyart changed the name of the show in 2006 to &quot;Real Science Friday&quot; as a challenge to National Public Radio&#x27;s show &quot;Science Friday.&quot; On December 28, 2012, Enyart settled a trademark infringement and cybersquatting lawsuit brought against him by NPR and renamed his show &quot;Real Science Radio.&quot;

== Activism and views ==
=== Abortion ===
Enyart served as a spokesperson for the anti-abortion group American Right to Life. He picketed the homes of doctors who performed abortions, causing one Colorado town to ban such protests in residential neighborhoods. Enyart criticized presidential candidates who did not share his view on abortion and advocated for the death penalty for women who had abortions.

=== AIDS ===
In 1995, Enyart angered families of people with AIDS when he read a man&#x27;s obituary on his television show, &quot;Bob Enyart Live,&quot; calling the deceased a sodomite. A regular feature of the show involved reading obituaries of people who had died from AIDS while playing &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; by Queen, whose lead singer, Freddie Mercury, died in 1991 from complications from AIDS.

=== Corporal punishment ===
Enyart was a proponent of corporal punishment of children. He served a 60-day jail sentence in the Jefferson County Correctional Facility after being convicted of child abuse for hitting a 7-year-old child with a belt so violently that he raised welts and broke the skin of the child.

In 1994, Enyart agreed to stop making late-night telephone calls to residents of Kenosha, Wisconsin, who were upset with the content of his program on a Kenosha television station. The calls prompted Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) to call for a Federal Communications Commission investigation to determine if the talk show host had broken laws.

Enyart was sentenced to 11 days in jail in June 2009 after he refused to pay a fine upon his conviction of criminal trespassing at the Focus on the Family headquarters.

=== O. J. Simpson ===
In 1999, Enyart bought about $16,000 worth of O. J. Simpson memorabilia, which he burned on the steps of the Los Angeles courthouse where Simpson was acquitted, to protest the verdict in the Simpson murder case.

=== Open Theism ===
Enyart was a proponent of the doctrine Open Theism which rejects several aspects of the Classical Theism of traditional Christianity. In 2014, he publicly debated the issue with Reformed Baptist apologist James R. White.

=== COVID-19 ===
Following a lawsuit brought by Enyart, a U.S. District Court judge ruled in October 2020 that the state could not impose mask-wearing mandates or limits on the size of gatherings at Denver Bible Church.

Enyart supported the debunked theory that COVID-19 vaccinations had been tested on aborted fetuses. He remained unvaccinated until his death from Covid.

==Personal life and death==
Enyart married Krista Johnson in 1982. The couple had two children, Josiah and Nathanial, before divorcing in 1989 as a result of his extra-marital affairs.

After a brief second marriage, Enyart married Cheryl Mayns in 1994. In 1999, he served a 60-day jail sentence after being convicted of child abuse for hitting her 7-year-old child with a belt so violently that he raised welts and broke the skin of the child.

In August 2021, Enyart announced that he had contracted COVID-19. He died from the virus on September 12, 2021, at the age of 62.

<text>The Brooklyn Eagle (originally joint name The Brooklyn Eagle and Kings County Democrat, later The Brooklyn Daily Eagle before shortening title further to &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;) was an afternoon daily newspaper published in the city and later borough of Brooklyn, in New York City, for 114 years from 1841 to 1955.

At one point, the publication was the afternoon paper with the largest daily circulation in the United States. Walt Whitman, the 19th-century poet, was its editor for two years. Other notable editors of the &quot;Eagle&quot; included Democratic Party political figure Thomas Kinsella, seminal folklorist Charles Montgomery Skinner, St. Clair McKelway (editor-in-chief from 1894 to 1915 and a great-uncle of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; journalist), Arthur M. Howe (a prominent Canadian American who served as editor-in-chief from 1915 to 1931 and as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Advisory Board from 1920 to 1946) and Cleveland Rodgers (an authority on Whitman and close friend of Robert Moses who was editor-in-chief from 1931 to 1938 before serving as an influential member of the New York City Planning Commission until 1951).

The paper, added &quot;Daily&quot; to its name as &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle and Kings County Democrat&quot; on June 1, 1846. The banner name was shortened on May 14, 1849, to &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, but the lower masthead retained the political name until June 8. On September 5, 1938, the name was further shortened, to &quot;Brooklyn Eagle,&quot; with &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; continuing to appear below the masthead of the editorial page, through the end of its original run in 1955. The paper ceased publication in 1955 due to a prolonged strike. It was briefly revived from the bankrupt estate between 1960 and 1963.

A new version of the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; as a revival of the old newspaper&#x27;s traditions began publishing in 1996. It has no business relation to the original &quot;Eagle&quot; (the name having lost trademark protection). The new paper publishes a daily historical/nostalgia feature called &quot;On This Day in History&quot;, made up of much material from the original publication.

==History==

&quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; was first published on October 26, 1841. Its address at this time, and for many years afterwards, was at 28 Old Fulton Street, Brooklyn (today the site of a landmark building known as the &quot;Eagle Warehouse&quot;). A few days after it started, the paper suspended publication for a month due to a printing press fire. From 1846 to 1848, the newspaper&#x27;s editor was the poet Walt Whitman.

The paper started as a combination of objective news and Democratic party organ. During the American Civil War, the &quot;Eagle&quot; supported the Democratic Party; as such, its mailing privileges through the United States Post Office Department were once revoked due to a forged letter supposedly sent by President Abraham Lincoln. The &quot;Eagle&quot; played an important role in shaping Brooklyn&#x27;s civic identity. The once-independent city became the third-largest city in America at that time, across the water from old New York City. In 1898, it became a borough as part of the annexation and merger campaign that formed the City of Greater New York. The &quot;Eagle&quot; had editorially tried to forestall and stop this process, claiming that Brooklyn would go from being a great city on its own to a hinterland of the bigger city.

In August 1938, Frank D. Schroth bought the newspaper from M. Preston Goodfellow. In addition to dropping the word &quot;Daily&quot; from the paper&#x27;s front page, Schroth increased the paper&#x27;s profile and readership with more active local coverage focused on the borough as opposed to the other competing dailies at that time in Manhattan, such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot;, New York Journal-American, &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun&quot;, &quot;New York Daily Mirror,&quot; and, later, &quot;Newsday&quot;, further out in the Long Island suburbs.

The newspaper received the 1951 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its &quot;crime reporting during the year&quot;. Investigative journalist Ed Reid in an eight-part series exposed the activities of bookmaker Harry Gross and corrupt members of the New York City Police Department. This exposé led to an investigation by the Brooklyn District Attorney, and resulted in the eventual resignation of Mayor of New York City William O&#x27;Dwyer.

=== Hollow Nickel Case ===
On June 22, 1953, a newspaper boy, collecting for the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;, at an apartment building at 3403 Foster Avenue in Brooklyn, was paid with a nickel that felt funny to him. When he dropped it on the ground, it popped open and contained microfilm inside. The microfilm contained a series of numbers. He told the New York City Police Department, which in two days told a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent about the strange nickel. The FBI was not able to link the nickel to KGB agents until a KGB (Committee on State Security of the Soviet Union) agent, Reino Häyhänen, wanted to defect to the West and the U.S. in May 1957, including Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (aka Rudolph Ivanovich Abel).

=== Closure ===

In the face of the continued economic pressure brought on by a 47-day strike by the local reporters&#x27; trade union, the Newspaper Guild, and later attempting to sell the &quot;Eagle&quot;, the paper published its last edition on January 28, 1955, and shut down for good on March 16, 1955. Thomas N. Schroth, the publisher&#x27;s son, served as the newspaper&#x27;s managing editor in the last three years of its existence. Thereafter, he became editor of &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; and founded &quot;National Journal&quot; in Washington, D.C. This occurred around the same time as the Brooklyn Dodgers professional baseball team (who had played since 1913 at Ebbets Field in Crown Heights) shocked New Yorkers by joining Manhattan&#x27;s New York Giants (a fellow National League team based at the Polo Grounds in Washington Heights) in moving to the West Coast, becoming the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants in the process.

The loss of both primary national icons of the borough&#x27;s identity within two and a half years—compounded by such factors as longstanding institutional decline at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the Brooklyn Army Terminal, which were both decommissioned in 1966; the precipitous contraction of the borough&#x27;s manufacturing sector after state-level right-to-work laws were permitted by the 1947 Taft–Hartley Act; the advent of containerization and the 1956–1962 development of the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey, largely supplanting the panoply of breakbulk cargo facilities that had scaled Brooklyn&#x27;s western waterfront from Greenpoint to Bush Terminal for decades; and the deeply intertwined phenomena of redlining, suburbanization and white flight—sent the borough into a psychological and socioeconomic slump. Comparatively sanguine developments—ranging from the initial wave of professional-driven gentrification in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill and Park Slope (leading to the former neighborhood&#x27;s designation as New York City&#x27;s first landmark historic district in 1965) to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (which removed racially-based restrictions on immigration to the United States, enabling many neighborhoods to be revitalized by migrants from Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean)—did not immediately attenuate the malaise in the popular consciousness. Notwithstanding the Heights and analogous enclaves, Brooklyn as a whole continued to elicit disproportionately vituperative scorn (first reified decades earlier in the stock &quot;uneducated Brooklyn character&quot; of classical Hollywood cinema, a trope that continued to manifest in such later films as John Badham&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), and in an array of deprecatory literary works emblematized by James Agee&#x27;s &quot;Brooklyn Is&quot;) from affluent, Manhattan-based New Yorkers working in the city&#x27;s influential media and FIRE industries. Ultimately, the publication of key counternarratives (such as the oeuvre of Jonathan Lethem) and the broader maturation of the borough&#x27;s postwar institutions would effectively render Manhattan&#x27;s cultural hegemony moot by the late 2000s.

As journalist Pete Hamill (who worked as a delivery boy for the &quot;Eagle&quot;) observed in &quot;New York&quot; in 1969,[Even] though the &quot;Eagle&quot; was not a great paper, it had a great function: it helped to weld together an extremely heterogeneous community. Without it, Brooklyn became a vast network of hamlets, whose boundaries were rigidly drawn but whose connections with each other were vague at best, hostile at worst. None of the three surviving metropolitan newspapers really covers Brooklyn now until events ... have reached the stage of crisis; the &quot;New York Times&quot; has more people in Asia than it has in Brooklyn, and you could excuse that, certainly, on grounds of priorities if you did not also know that this most powerful New York paper has three columnists writing on national affairs, one writing on European affairs, and none at all writing about this city. Without the &quot;Eagle&quot;, local merchants floundered for years in their attempt to reach their old customers; two large Brooklyn department stores—Namm&#x27;s and Loeser&#x27;s—folded up. If you were looking for an apartment or a furnished room in Brooklyn, there was no central bulletin board.

=== 1960s revival attempts ===

In 1960, former comic book publisher Robert W. Farrell acquired the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s&quot; assets in bankruptcy court, five years later after its closing, publishing five Sunday editions of the paper in 1960. In 1962–1963, under the corporate name Newspaper Consolidated Corporation, Farrell and his partner Philip Enciso briefly revived the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; newspaper as a daily. During the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike, the paper had circulation grow from 50,000 to 390,000 until the strike ended.

The final edition appeared on June 25, 1963.

==1990s–present version==
The Brooklyn Daily Bulletin, a much smaller newspaper also focusing on the Brooklyn borough began publishing when the original &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; folded in 1955.

In 1996, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; merged with a newly revived &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, and now publishes a morning paper five days a week under the Brooklyn Daily Eagle name. There is also a weekend edition published Saturdays as Brooklyn Eagle: Weekend Edition. This revived &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; has no business relationship with the original &quot;Eagle&quot;; but it adopted the &quot;Eagle&quot; name adding it to its &quot;Bulletin&quot; title after the &quot;Eagle&quot; name fell into the public domain, and following a dispute with another Brooklyn publisher over ownership of the &quot;Eagle&quot; name. The new publication is published by J. Dozier Hasty. The &quot;Daily Eagle&quot; editorial staff includes 25 full-time reporters, writers, and photographers.

As of 2014, it is one of three English-language daily newspapers published in the borough of Brooklyn (the others are the &quot;New York Daily Challenge&quot; and &quot;Hamodia&quot;).

As an homage to the original &quot;Eagle&quot;, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle publishes a daily feature called &quot;On This Day in History&quot;, made up of much material taken from the original &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;.

Several exhibits have been held regarding the role of the paper in creating the identity of Brooklyn and its citizens at the Brooklyn Historical Society, including extensive mention and documentation in several histories published.

==Everything Brooklyn Media==
The new publication is published under the auspices of Everything Brooklyn Media (now stylized as ebrooklynmedia). The &quot;Daily Eagle&quot; editorial coverage has grown to include other areas with local publications under the ebrooklynmedia banner. These include:
*&quot;The Bay Ridge Eagle&quot; a weekly section in Western Brooklyn, particularly Bay Ridge area.
*&quot;Brooklyn Reporter&quot; in South Brooklyn
*&quot;Queens Daily Eagle&quot; in Queens – first issue printed June 25, 2018.
*&quot;Brooklyn Heights Press and Cobble Hill News&quot; in Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill, Brooklyn areas
*&quot;Brooklyn Barrister&quot;, a legal practice publication

<text>Oded Golan (; born 1951 in Tel Aviv) is an Israeli engineer, entrepreneur, and antiquities collector. He owns one of the largest collections of Biblical archaeology in the world.
==Biography==
Oded Golan is the son of an engineer and a professor of microbiology. He served as an officer in the Israel Defense Forces before studying industrial and management engineering at the Technion, graduating with honors. Since childhood, Golan has had a keen interest in archeology and antiquities. At the age of 10, during a visit to the ancient site of Tel Hatzor, he discovered the world’s oldest dictionary, which was later published by Professor Yigael Yadin. At the age of 12, Golan participated in excavations at Masada.

== Antiquity collection ==
Golan&#x27;s collection, amassed over a period of more than 50 years, contains thousands of archaeological artifacts, the vast majority of which were purchased from antiquities dealers, mostly in East Jerusalem.

Golan’s collection includes a wide range of artifacts which together represent the culture of Israel and TransJordan from the fifth millennium BCE to the fifth century AD. Among the items that attracted international attention is the James Ossuary, the bone box possibly used to intern the bones of James, brother of Jesus.

==Controversy==
In June 2003, Golan was accused by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) of involvement in the forgery of one half of the James Ossuary inscription, the Jehoash Inscription and other items. Golan denied any involvement in forgery and argued that he purchased the two items from licensed antiquities dealers in 1976 and 1999 respectively. Four other defendants were indicted along with Golan, including two of the largest antiquities dealers in Israel. 

In 2012, the court acquitted Golan of forgery and fraud, but convicted him of illegal trading in antiquities. In late 2013, the Supreme Court ordered the State to return to Golan the James Ossuary, the Jehoash Inscription and hundreds of other items that had been confiscated by the IAA &quot;for the purpose of investigation.&quot;

The IAA claimed that Golan and numerous antiquity dealers were involved in forgery assisted by experts in ancient Semitic languages. Media coverage and documentary films which reported the case created what Golan called a “media circus&quot;. The BBC reported that when the police took Golan into custody and searched his apartment they discovered a workshop with a range of tools, materials, and half finished &#x27;antiquities&#x27;. According to the allegations, collectors around the world paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for artifacts that came through Golan&#x27;s associates. Dozens items were examined. Police suspected that artefacts made by these forgers had found their way into leading museums.

The documentary film &quot;The History Merchants&quot; alleged Golan (working with a team of people, including an expert in ancient semitic languages and an artisan) had produced forged artifacts for sale on the religious antiquities market. In 2004, &quot;Horizon&quot; aired &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Tablet of Stone&quot; on the BBC. This program included allegations of forgery and fraudulent activity by Golan.

On December 29, 2004, Golan was indicted in an Israeli court along with three antiquities dealers; Robert Deutsch, one of Israel’s leading antiquities dealers and an inscriptions expert who has lectured at the University of Haifa; dealer and conservator Refael Braun; and dealer Shlomo Cohen; Faiz al-Amla, a Palestinian dealer from the village of Beit Ula in the Hebron Hills was charged with trading in antiquities without a license. Early in the trial, charges were dropped against Braun and Cohen, leaving Golan and Deutsch as the only defendants.

Golan denied any involvement in forgery and argued that the inscriptions were purchased from licensed antiquities dealers. He presented evidence that he had purchased the James Ossuary in 1976 and the Jehoash Table in 1999. Golan stated that to the best of his understanding and judgment, these are authentic ancient inscriptions.

== Court ruling and acquittal ==
In a trial that lasted almost eight years (2004–2012), the District Court of Jerusalem heard testimony relating to the authenticity of the inscriptions on the James Ossuary and the Jehoash Tablet from over 50 experts from a wide range of fields, who examined the inscriptions and submitted dozens of scientific reports, and 70 other witnesses including antiquities dealers and well-known collectors. Trial transcripts covered over 12,000 pages, and the court ruling was 438 pages long.

The IAA announced that they accepted the court&#x27;s ruling. The State accepted the main decision of the District Court and did not appeal against the judgment. After the judgment, the State moved to confiscate the James Ossuary and the Jehoash Tablet for the State Treasury, arguing that these items may well be of enormous historic, religious and archeological significance and therefore should not remain in private hands. The District Court and the Supreme Court denied this motion and ordered the State to return to Golan all the antiquities that had been taken from him. The James Ossuary and the Jehoash Tablet, as well as hundreds of other antiquities, were returned to Golan in late 2013.

<text>Internexin, alpha-internexin, is a Class IV intermediate filament approximately 66 KDa. The protein was originally purified from rat optic nerve and spinal cord. The protein copurifies with other neurofilament subunits, as it was originally discovered, however in some mature neurons it can be the only neurofilament expressed. The protein is present in developing neuroblasts and in the central nervous system of adults. The protein is a major component of the intermediate filament network in small interneurons and cerebellar granule cells, where it is present in the parallel fibers.

==Structure==

Alpha-internexin has a homologous central rod domain of approximately 310 amino acid residues that form a highly conserved alpha helical region. The central rod domain is responsible for coiled-coil structure and is flanked by an amino terminal head region and a carboxy terminal tail. This rod domain is also involved in the 10 nm filament assembly structure. The head and tail regions contain segments that are highly homologous to the NF-M’s structure. The head region is highly basic and contains many serine and threonine polymers while the tail region has distinct sequence motifs like a glutamate rich region. The alpha domain is composed of heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues that aid the formation of a coiled coil structure. The structure of Alpha-internexin is highly conserved between rats, mice and humans.

Alpha-internexin can form homopolymers, unlike the heteropolymer the neurofilaments form. This formation suggests that α-internexin and the three neurofilaments form separate filament systems. Not only can alpha-internexin form homopolymers but it form a network of extended filaments in the absence of other intermediate filament proteins and efficiently co-assemble with any type IV or type III subunit, in vitro. In Ching et al., a model of the intermediate filaments assembly is proposed. This model includes the following steps: 
*Step 1: in the first step of IF assembly two parallel, unstaggered intermediate filament polypeptides chains form a dimer via their a-helical rod domains; these dimers can be either homodimers or heterodimers.
*Step 2: the dimers may associate laterally to form antiparallel, unstaggered tetramers or antiparallel, staggered tetramers.
*Step 3: the dimers may also associate longitudinally with a short head-to-tail overlap of the a-helical rod domains.
*Step 4: these lateral and longitudinal associations lead to the formation of protofibrils (octamers) and ultimately 10 nm intermediate filaments.

The close connection between the neurofilament triplet proteins and α-internexin is quite obvious. α-internexin is functionally interdependent with the neurofilament triplet proteins. If one genetically deletes NF-M and/or NF-H in mice, the transport and presence, in the axons of the Central Nervous System, of α-internexin will be drastically reduced. Not only are they functionally similar, the turnover rates are also similar among the four proteins.

==Function and expression==

It is expressed in early development in the neuroblast along with α-internexin and peripherin. As development continues into neurons the neurofilament triplet proteins (NF-L: neurofilament low molecular mass, NF-M: neurofilament medium molecular mass, and NF-H: neurofilament high molecular mass) are expressed in increasing molecular mass order as α-internexin expression decreases. In the neuroblast phase of development α-internexin is found in the neural tube and neural crest derived neuroblasts.

In adult cells, α-internexin is expressed abundantly in the central nervous system, in the cytoplasm of neurons, along with the neurofilament triplet proteins. They are expressed in a relatively fixed stoichiometric ratio to neurofilaments.

Alpha-internexin is a brain and central nervous system filament that is involved in neuronal development and has been suggested to play a role in axonal outgrowth. Gefiltin and xefiltin, homologs of α-internexin in zebrafish and Xenopus laevis, respectively, are highly expressed during retinal growth and optic axon regeneration and therefore have aided the speculation that α-internexin and axonal outgrowth may be connected. With this speculation, studies have been performed to develop a stronger bridge between the two. Through knockout studies using mice, the inhibition of α-internexin had no visible effect on development of the nervous system which suggests that axonal outgrowth is unaffected by α-internexin, however, the knockout study failed to rule out subtle differences that the protein may have caused. Not only has α-internexin been linked to axonal outgrowth but it may regulate axonal stability or diameter through changes in filaments and their subunit composition. Also, internexin could be involved in the maintenance or the formation of dendritic spines. There have been many implications as to the function of α-internexin, but no concrete evidence currently exists to fully support or negate these speculations.

==Disease associations==

α-internexin has also been implicated in several degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, neuropathies, tropical spastic paraparesis and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy. In HTLV-1 myelopathy, Tax, transactivator expressed by HTLV-1, interacts with α-internexin in cell culture resulting in dramatic reduction in Tax transcactivation and intermediate filament formation.

<text>Desmin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;DES&quot; gene. Desmin is a muscle-specific, type III intermediate filament that integrates the sarcolemma, Z disk, and nuclear membrane in sarcomeres and regulates sarcomere architecture.

== Structure ==

Desmin is a 53.5 kD protein composed of 470 amino acids, encoded by the human &quot;DES&quot; gene located on the long arm of chromosome 2. There are three major domains to the desmin protein: a conserved alpha helix rod, a variable non alpha helix head, and a carboxy-terminal tail. Desmin, as all intermediate filaments, shows no polarity when assembled. The rod domain consists of 308 amino acids with parallel alpha helical coiled coil dimers and three linkers to disrupt it. The rod domain connects to the head domain. The head domain 84 amino acids with many arginine, serine, and aromatic residues is important in filament assembly and dimer-dimer interactions. The tail domain is responsible for the integration of filaments and interaction with proteins and organelles. Desmin is only expressed in vertebrates, however homologous proteins are found in many organisms. Desmin is a subunit of intermediate filaments in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and smooth muscle tissue. In cardiac muscle, desmin is present in Z-discs and intercalated discs. Desmin has been shown to interact with desmoplakin and αB-crystallin.

== Function ==

Desmin was first described in 1976, first purified in 1977, the gene was cloned in 1989, and the first knockout mouse was created in 1996. The function of desmin has been deduced through studies in knockout mice. Desmin is one of the earliest protein markers for muscle tissue in embryogenesis as it is detected in the somites. Although it is present early in the development of muscle cells, it is only expressed at low levels, and increases as the cell nears terminal differentiation. A similar protein, vimentin, is present in higher amounts during embryogenesis while desmin is present in higher amounts after differentiation. This suggests that there may be some interaction between the two in determining muscle cell differentiation. However desmin knockout mice develop normally and only experience defects later in life. Since desmin is expressed at a low level during differentiation another protein may be able to compensate for desmin&#x27;s function early in development but not later on.

In adult desmin-null mice, hearts from 10 week-old animals showed drastic alterations in muscle architecture, including a misalignment of myofibrils and disorganization and swelling of mitochondria; findings that were more severe in cardiac relative to skeletal muscle. Cardiac tissue also exhibited progressive necrosis and calcification of the myocardium. A separate study examined this in more detail in cardiac tissue and found that murine hearts lacking desmin developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and chamber dilation combined with systolic dysfunction. In adult muscle, desmin forms a scaffold around the Z-disk of the sarcomere and connects the Z-disk to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. It links the myofibrils laterally by connecting the Z-disks. Through its connection to the sarcomere, desmin connects the contractile apparatus to the cell nucleus, mitochondria, and post-synaptic areas of motor endplates. These connections maintain the structural and mechanical integrity of the cell during contraction while also helping in force transmission and longitudinal load bearing.

In human heart failure, desmin expression is upregulated, which has been hypothesized to be a defense mechanism in an attempt to maintain normal sarcomere alignment amidst disease pathogenesis. There is some evidence that desmin may also connect the sarcomere to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through desmosomes which could be important in signalling between the ECM and the sarcomere which could regulate muscle contraction and movement. Finally, desmin may be important in mitochondria function. When desmin is not functioning properly there is improper mitochondrial distribution, number, morphology and function. Since desmin links the mitochondria to the sarcomere it may transmit information about contractions and energy need and through this regulate the aerobic respiration rate of the muscle cell.

== Clinical significance ==

Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy (DRM or desminopathy) is a subgroup of the myofibrillar myopathy diseases and is the result of a mutation in the gene that codes for desmin which by changing the protein structure prevents it from forming protein filaments, and rather, forms aggregates of desmin and other proteins throughout the cell. Desmin (&quot;DES&quot;) mutations have been associated with restrictive, dilated, idiopathic, arrhythmogenic and non-compaction cardimyopathy. The N-terminal part of the 1A desmin subdomain is a genetic hot spot region for mutations affecting filament assembly. Some of these &quot;DES&quot; mutations cause an aggregation of desmin within the cytoplasm. A mutation p.A120D was discovered in a family, where several members had sudden cardiac death. In addition, &quot;DES&quot; mutations cause frequently cardiac conduction diseases.

Desmin has been evaluated for role in assessing the depth of invasion of urothelial carcinoma in TURBT specimens.

<text>Vimentin is a structural protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;VIM&quot; gene. Its name comes from the Latin &quot;vimentum&quot; which refers to an array of flexible rods.

Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein that is expressed in mesenchymal cells. IF proteins are found in all animal cells as well as bacteria. Intermediate filaments, along with tubulin-based microtubules and actin-based microfilaments, comprises the cytoskeleton. All IF proteins are expressed in a highly developmentally-regulated fashion; vimentin is the major cytoskeletal component of mesenchymal cells. Because of this, vimentin is often used as a marker of mesenchymally-derived cells or cells undergoing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during both normal development and metastatic progression.

== Structure ==

The assembly of the fibrous vimentin filament that forms the cytoskeleton follows a gradual sequence. The vimentin monomer has a central α-helical domain, capped on each end by non-helical amino (head) and carboxyl (tail) domains. Two monomers are likely co-translationally expressed in a way that facilitates their interaction forming a coiled-coil dimer, which is the basic subunit of vimentin assembly. A pair of coiled-coil dimers connect in an antiparallel fashion to form a tetramer. Eight tetramers join to form what is known as the unit-length filament (ULF), ULFs then stick to each other and elongate followed by compaction to form the fibrous proteins.

The α-helical sequences contain a pattern of hydrophobic amino acids that contribute to forming a &quot;hydrophobic seal&quot; on the surface of the helix. In addition, there is a periodic distribution of acidic and basic amino acids that seems to play an important role in stabilizing coiled-coil dimers. The spacing of the charged residues is optimal for ionic salt bridges, which allows for the stabilization of the α-helix structure. While this type of stabilization is intuitive for intrachain interactions, rather than interchain interactions, scientists have proposed that perhaps the switch from intrachain salt bridges formed by acidic and basic residues to the interchain ionic associations contributes to the assembly of the filament.

== Function ==

Vimentin plays a significant role in supporting and anchoring the position of the organelles in the cytosol. Vimentin is attached to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, either laterally or terminally.

The dynamic nature of vimentin is important when offering flexibility to the cell. Scientists found that vimentin provided cells with a resilience absent from the microtubule or actin filament networks, when under mechanical stress &quot;in vivo&quot;. Therefore, in general, it is accepted that vimentin is the cytoskeletal component responsible for maintaining cell integrity. (It was found that cells without vimentin are extremely delicate when disturbed with a micropuncture). Transgenic mice that lack vimentin appeared normal and did not show functional differences. It is possible that the microtubule network may have compensated for the absence of the intermediate network. This result supports an intimate interaction between microtubules and vimentin. Moreover, when microtubule depolymerizers were present, vimentin reorganization occurred, once again implying a relationship between the two systems. On the other hand, wounded mice that lack the vimentin gene heal slower than their wild type counterparts.

In essence, vimentin is responsible for maintaining cell shape, integrity of the cytoplasm, and stabilizing cytoskeletal interactions. Vimentin has been shown to eliminate toxic proteins in JUNQ and IPOD inclusion bodies in asymmetric division of mammalian cell lines.

Also, vimentin is found to control the transport of low-density lipoprotein, LDL, -derived cholesterol from a lysosome to the site of esterification. With the blocking of transport of LDL-derived cholesterol inside the cell, cells were found to store a much lower percentage of the lipoprotein than normal cells with vimentin. This dependence seems to be the first process of a biochemical function in any cell that depends on a cellular intermediate filament network. This type of dependence has ramifications on the adrenal cells, which rely on cholesteryl esters derived from LDL.

Vimentin plays a role in aggresome formation, where it forms a cage surrounding a core of aggregated protein.

In addition to its conventional intracellular localisation, vimentin can be found extracellularly. Vimentin can be expressed as a cell surface protein and have suggested roles in immune reactions. It can also be released in phosphorylated forms to the extracellular space by activated macrophages, astrocytes are also known to release vimentin.

== Clinical significance ==

It has been used as a sarcoma tumor marker to identify mesenchyme. Its specificity as a biomarker has been disputed by Jerad Gardner. Vimentin is present in spindle cell squameous cell carcinoma.

Methylation of the vimentin gene has been established as a biomarker of colon cancer and this is being utilized in the development of fecal tests for colon cancer. Statistically significant levels of vimentin gene methylation have also been observed in certain upper gastrointestinal pathologies such as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and intestinal type gastric cancer. High levels of DNA methylation in the promoter region have also been associated with markedly decreased survival in hormone positive breast cancers.
Downregulation of vimentin was identified in cystic variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma using a proteomic approach.

<doc id="1300487" wikidata="Q14864874" url="?curid=1300487" title="Peripherin">
<text>Peripherin is a type III intermediate filament protein expressed mainly in neurons of the peripheral nervous system. It is also found in neurons of the central nervous system that have projections toward peripheral structures, such as spinal motor neurons. Its size, structure, and sequence/location of protein motifs is similar to other type III intermediate filament proteins such as desmin, vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Like these proteins, peripherin can self-assemble to form homopolymeric filamentous networks (networks formed from peripherin protein dimers), but it can also heteropolymerize with neurofilaments in several neuronal types. This protein in humans is encoded by the &quot;PRPH&quot; gene. Peripherin is thought to play a role in neurite elongation during development and axonal regeneration after injury, but its exact function is unknown. It is also associated with some of the major neuropathologies that characterize amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but despite extensive research into how neurofilaments and peripherin contribute to ALS, their role in this disease is still unidentified.

==History==
Peripherin, first named such in 1984, was also known as 57 kDa neuronal intermediate filament prior to 1990. In 1987, a second distinct peripherally located retinal rod protein was also given the name peripherin. To distinguish between the two, this second protein is referred to peripherin 2 or peripherin/RDS (retinal degeneration slow) for its location and role in retinal disease.

==Structure and properties==
Peripherin was discovered as being the major intermediate filament in neuroblastoma cell lines and in rat pheochromocytoma cells. It is classified by gene structure and coding sequence as a type III intermediate filament protein because of its homology with vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and desmin. All intermediate filament proteins share a common secondary structure consisting of three main domains, the most conserved of which is the central α-helical rod domain. This central coil is capped by non-helical head (N-terminal) and tail (C-terminal) domains. The α-helical rod domain contains repeating segments of hydrophobic amino acids, such that the first and fourth residues of every set of seven amino acids are usually nonpolar. This specific structure enables two intermediate filament polypeptides to coil together and create a &quot;hydrophobic seal&quot;. The rod also contains specific placement of alternating acidic and basic residues, many of which are spaced 4 amino acids apart. This spacing is optimal for the formation of ionic salt bridges, which serve to stabilize the α-helical rod through intrachain interactions. A switch from intrachain salt bridges to interchain ionic associations may assist in intermediate filament assembly by utilizing electrostatic interactions to stabilize coiled-coil dimers. The head and tail regions of intermediate filament proteins vary in length and amino acid composition, with greater variations in length occurring in the tail regions.

Peripherin, unlike keratin IFs, can self-assemble and exist as homopolymers (see polymer). They can also heteropolymerize, or co-assemble, with other type III proteins or the light neurofilament subunit (NF-L) to form intermediate filament networks. Type III proteins like peripherin can exist in different states within a cell. These states include nonfilamentous particles which combine to firm short IFs, or squiggles. These squiggles come together to form long IFs that make up cytoskeletal networks. Studies of network assembly in spreading fibroblasts and differentiating nerve cells show that particles move along microtubules in a kinesin and dynein-dependent manner, and as spreading continues, the particles polymerize into intermediate filaments.

In addition to the main species of peripherin, 57 kDa, two other forms have been identified in mice: Per 61 and Per 56. These two alternatives are both made by alternative splicing. Per 61 is created by introducing a 32 amino acid insertion within coil 2b of the α-helical rod domain of peripherin. Per 56 is made by a receptor on exon 9 of the peripherin gene transcript which induces a frameshift and replacement of a 21 amino acid sequence in the C-terminal found on the dominant 57 form with a new 8 amino acid sequence. The functions of these two alternative forms of peripherin are unknown. Per 57 and 56 are normally co-expressed, whereas Per 61 is not found in normal peripherin expression in adult motor neurons.

=== Tissue distribution ===
Peripherin is widely expressed in the cell body and axons of neurons in the peripheral nervous system. These include small-sized root ganglion neurons, lower motor neurons, sensory and motor neurons of the cranial nerves, and autonomic neurons in ganglia and the enteric nervous system. It is also expressed in the central nervous system in a small set of brainstem and spinal cord neurons that have projections toward peripheral structures. Some of these structures include the hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei, pontine cholinergic nuclei, some cerebellar nuclei, and scattered neurons in the cerebral cortex. They can also be found in the ventral horn neurons and in the cholinergic laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) and pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT) nuclei.

A comparison of peripherin expression in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus in mice showed a sixty-fold higher expression in the posterior hypothalamus. This higher expression is due to the presence of peripherin in the tuberomammillary neurons of the mouse posterior hypothalamus.

== Function ==
The diverse properties of intermediate filaments, compared with the conserved microtubule and actin filament proteins, could be responsible for the distinguishing molecular shapes of different cell types. In nerve cells, for example, the expressions of different types of IFs relates to the change in shape during development. Early stages of development in neurons is marked by the outgrowth of neurites and axons contributing to the cells asymmetric shape. During these transitions in cell shape, only homopolymer type III intermediate filaments, such as those with peripherin, are made. As the nerve cell matures, these type III IFs are replaced by more complex type IV neurofilaments expanding the diameter of axons in order to attain normal velocities of action potentials.

The exact function of peripherin is unknown. Expression of peripherin in development is greatest during the axonal growth phase and decreases postnatally, which suggests a role in neurite elongation and axonal guidance during development. Expression is also increased after axonal injury, such as peripheral axotomy in motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia. This upregulation implies that peripherin may also play a role in axon regeneration. However, experiments using peripherin depleted PC12 cells and peripherin knockout mice provide proof that the majority of neurons have no requirement of peripherin for axonal guidance and regrowth. PC12 cells lacking peripherin showed no defects in neurite outgrowth and peripherin knockout mice develop normally with no anatomical abnormalities or different phenotypes. In these experiments, peripherin deficiency did produce an upregulation of α-internexin, indicating the possibility that this type IV intermediate filament makes up for the loss of peripherin. Future studies of double knockout mice for both the peripherin and α-internexin genes might address this theory. However, while most peripherin knockout mice displayed normal neuron growth, its absence did affect development of a subset of unmyelinated sensory axons. In such mice, there was a &quot;34% reduction in the number of L5 unmyelinated sensory fibers that correlated with a decreased binding of the lectin IB4.&quot;

== Gene (PRPH) ==
The complete sequence of the human (GenBank L14565), rat (GenBank M26232) and mouse (EMBL X59840) peripherin genes (PRPH) have been reported and complementary DNAs (cDNA) thus far described are those for rat, mouse and Xenopus peripherin. The use of a mouse cDNA probe during the in situ hybridization procedure allowed for the localization of the PRPH gene to the E-F region of mouse chromosome 15 and the q12-q13 region of human chromosome 12.

The overall structure of the peripherin gene is nine exons separated by eight introns. This configuration is conserved among the three known mammalian species with known coding for peripherin, namely human, rat and mouse. The nucleotide sequences of human and rat exons were 90% identical and produced a predicted protein that differed at only 18 of 475 amino acid residues. Comparison of introns 1 and 2 also yielded high homology of conserved segments. The 5&#x27; flanking regions and regulatory sequences were also very similar and a nerve growth factor negative regulatory element, a Hox protein (See Hox gene) binding site, and a heat shock element were found in all known peripherin genes.

=== Regulatory mechanisms ===
Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays the major role in the regulation of peripherin. It is both a transcriptional inducer and post-translational regulator of peripherin expression in PC12 and neuroblastoma cells. The mechanism of NGF-induced activation occurs through 5&#x27; flanking elements and intragenic sequences involving the TATA box and other upstream elements as well as depression at a negative element. The specific signals regulating peripherin expression in vivo are unknown. The peripherin gene is transcriptionally activated in both small and large sized sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion at about day E10, and mRNA is present in these cells after postnatal day 2 and throughout adulthood. Post transcriptional mechanisms reduce detectable peripherin to only the small sized cells; however, crushing of the peripheral processes in dorsal root ganglion neurons lead to mRNA and detectable peripherin in the large sized cells.

The proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, can also induce peripherin expression through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This specific upregulation is linked to neuronal regeneration.

== Potential role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ==

Protein and neurofilamentous aggregates are characteristic of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease. Spheroids, specifically, which are protein aggregates of neuronal intermediate filaments, have been found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Peripherin has been found in such spheroids in conjunction with other neurofilaments in other neuronal diseases, thus suggesting that peripherin may play a role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

=== Alternative splicing ===
An alternatively spliced mouse peripherin variant was identified that includes intron 4, a region that is spliced out of the abundant peripherin forms. Because of the change in reading frame, this variant produces a larger form of peripherin (Per61). In human peripherin, the inclusion of introns 3 and 4, regions that are similarly spliced out of the abundant peripherin protein forms, results in the generation of a truncated peripherin protein (Per28). In both cases, an antibody specific to a peptide coded by the intron regions stained the filamentous inclusions of in tissues affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These studies suggest that such alternative splicing could play a role in the disease and lend themselves to further investigation.

=== Mutations ===
Experiments examining peripherin overexpression in mice have suggested that PRPH mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with more recent studies investigating the prevalence of such mutations in humans. Though many polymorphic variants of PRPH exist, two variants of PRPH were seen uniquely in patients with ALS, both of which consisted of a frameshift mutation. In the first variant, a single base pair deletion in exon 1 of PRPH was predictive of a peripherin species truncated to 85 amino acids. This truncation negatively impacted the ability of the neurofilament network to assemble, thus suggesting that mutations in PRPH may play a role in at least a small percentage of human cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

The second variant consisted of an amino acid substitution from aspartate to tyrosine as a result of a single point mutation in exon 1. This was also shown to adversely affect the assembly of the neurofilament network. The PRPH mutations observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cause a change in the 3D structure of the protein. Consequently, the mutant peripherin forms aggregates instead of the filamentous network that it usually forms.

==Other clinical significance==
Peripherin may be involved in the pathology of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (or diabetes mellitus type 1) in animals; however, no direct linkage has been found in human patients. In a nonobese diabetic mouse model, peripherin has been found as a known autoantigen (See antigen). B cell clones reactive to peripherin have also been found in early stages of the disease. Since peripherin is expressed in both the peripheral nervous system and, in young animals, by islet beta cells, it is possible that the destruction of both peripheral nervous system elements and islet β-cells in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is due to the immune response to autoreactive peripherin.

Peripherin can also play a role in the definitive diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. Patients suspected of having the disease undergo rectal biopsy to look for the presence or absence of ganglion cells. However, the identification of these cells can be very difficult, especially in newborns where immature ganglion cells are easily confused with endothelial, mesenchyme and inflammatory cells. To aid in identification, a protocol utilizing peripherin and S-100 immunohistochemistry staining was developed to assist in the recognition of ganglion cells in rectal biopsies.

== Potential applications ==
Possible involvement of intermediate filaments such as peripherin in neurodegenerative diseases is currently being investigated. Interactions between intermediate filaments and other proteins are also being pursued. Peripherin has been shown to associate with protein kinase Cε, inducing its aggregation and leading to increased apoptosis. It may be possible to regulate this aggregation and apoptosis using siRNAs and protein kinase Cε. Pinpointing the source and possible resolution of protein aggregates is a promising direction for potential therapeutics.

<text>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a protein that is encoded by the &quot;GFAP&quot; gene in humans. It is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein that is expressed by numerous cell types of the central nervous system (CNS), including astrocytes and ependymal cells during development. GFAP has also been found to be expressed in glomeruli and peritubular fibroblasts taken from rat kidneys, Leydig cells of the testis in both hamsters and humans, human keratinocytes, human osteocytes and chondrocytes and stellate cells of the pancreas and liver in rats.

GFAP is closely related to the other three non-epithelial type III IF family members, vimentin, desmin and peripherin, which are all involved in the structure and function of the cell&#x27;s cytoskeleton. GFAP is thought to help to maintain astrocyte mechanical strength as well as the shape of cells, but its exact function remains poorly understood, despite the number of studies using it as a cell marker. The protein was named and first isolated and characterized by Lawrence F. Eng in 1969. In humans, it is located on the long arm of chromosome 17.

== Structure ==
Type III intermediate filaments contain three domains, named the head, rod and tail domains. The specific DNA sequence for the rod domain may differ between different type III intermediate filaments, but the structure of the protein is highly conserved. This rod domain coils around that of another filament to form a dimer, with the N-terminal and C-terminal of each filament aligned. Type III filaments such as GFAP are capable of forming both homodimers and heterodimers; GFAP can polymerize with other type III proteins. GFAP and other type III IF proteins cannot assemble with keratins, the type I and II intermediate filaments: in cells that express both proteins, two separate intermediate filament networks form, which can allow for specialization and increased variability.

To form networks, the initial GFAP dimers combine to make staggered tetramers, which are the basic subunits of an intermediate filament. Since rod domains alone &quot;in vitro&quot; do not form filaments, the non-helical head and tail domains are necessary for filament formation. The head and tail regions have greater variability of sequence and structure. In spite of this increased variability, the head of GFAP contains two conserved arginines and an aromatic residue that have been shown to be required for proper assembly.

==Function in the central nervous system==
GFAP is expressed in the central nervous system in astrocyte cells, and the concentration of GFAP differs between different regions in the CNS, where the highest levels are found in medulla oblongata, cervical spinal cord and hippocampus. It is involved in many important CNS processes, including cell communication and the functioning of the blood brain barrier.

GFAP has been shown to play a role in mitosis by adjusting the filament network present in the cell. During mitosis, there is an increase in the amount of phosphorylated GFAP, and a movement of this modified protein to the cleavage furrow. There are different sets of kinases at work; cdc2 kinase acts only at the G2 phase transition, while other GFAP kinases are active at the cleavage furrow alone. This specificity of location allows for precise regulation of GFAP distribution to the daughter cells. Studies have also shown that GFAP knockout mice undergo multiple degenerative processes including abnormal myelination, white matter structure deterioration, and functional/structural impairment of the blood–brain barrier. These data suggest that GFAP is necessary for many critical roles in the CNS.

GFAP is proposed to play a role in astrocyte-neuron interactions as well as cell-cell communication. In vitro, using antisense RNA, astrocytes lacking GFAP do not form the extensions usually present with neurons. Studies have also shown that Purkinje cells in GFAP knockout mice do not exhibit normal structure, and these mice demonstrate deficits in conditioning experiments such as the eye-blink task. Biochemical studies of GFAP have shown MgCl2 and/or calcium/calmodulin dependent phosphorylation at various serine or threonine residues by PKC and PKA which are two kinases that are important for the cytoplasmic transduction of signals. These data highlight the importance of GFAP for cell-cell communication.

GFAP has also been shown to be important in repair after CNS injury. More specifically for its role in the formation of glial scars in a multitude of locations throughout the CNS including the eye and brain.

===Autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy===

In 2016 a CNS inflammatory disorder associated with anti-GFAP antibodies was described. Patients with autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy developed meningoencephalomyelitis with inflammation of the meninges, the brain parenchyma, and the spinal cord. About one third of cases were associated with various cancers and many also expressed other CNS autoantibodies.

Meningoencephalitis is the predominant clinical presentation of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy in published case series. It also can appear associated with encephalomyelitis and parkinsonism.

==Disease states==
There are multiple disorders associated with improper GFAP regulation, and injury can cause glial cells to react in detrimental ways. Glial scarring is a consequence of several neurodegenerative conditions, as well as injury that severs neural material. The scar is formed by astrocytes interacting with fibrous tissue to re-establish the glial margins around the central injury core and is partially caused by up-regulation of GFAP.

Another condition directly related to GFAP is Alexander disease, a rare genetic disorder. Its symptoms include mental and physical retardation, dementia, enlargement of the brain and head, spasticity (stiffness of arms and/or legs), and seizures. The cellular mechanism of the disease is the presence of cytoplasmic accumulations containing GFAP and heat shock proteins, known as Rosenthal fibers. Mutations in the coding region of GFAP have been shown to contribute to the accumulation of Rosenthal fibers. Some of these mutations have been proposed to be detrimental to cytoskeleton formation as well as an increase in caspase 3 activity, which would lead to increased apoptosis of cells with these mutations. GFAP therefore plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alexander disease.

Notably, the expression of some GFAP isoforms have been reported to decrease in response to acute infection or neurodegeneration.
Additionally, reduction in GFAP expression has also been reported in Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy. The HIV-1 viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 can directly inhibit the phosphorylation of GFAP and GFAP levels can be decreased in response to chronic infection with HIV-1, varicella zoster, and pseudorabies. Decreases in GFAP expression have been reported in Down&#x27;s syndrome, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.

The generally high abundance of GFAP in the CNS has led to a great interest in GFAP as a blood biomarker of acute injury to the brain and spinal cord in different types of disease mechanisms, such as traumatic brain injury and cerebrovascular disease. Elevated blood levels of GFAP are also found in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, a disease targeting astrocytes. In a study of 22 child patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), children with abnormally high levels of GFAP were 13 times more likely to die and 11 times more likely to suffer brain injury than children with normal GFAP levels.

== Interactions ==

Glial fibrillary acidic protein has been shown to interact with MEN1 and PSEN1.

==Isoforms==
Although GFAP alpha is the only isoform which is able to assemble homomerically, GFAP has 8 different isoforms which label distinct subpopulations of astrocytes in the human and rodent brain. These isoforms include GFAP kappa, GFAP +1 and the currently best researched GFAP delta. GFAP delta appears to be linked with neural stem cells (NSCs) and may be involved in migration. GFAP+1 is an antibody which labels two isoforms. Although GFAP+1 positive astrocytes are supposedly not reactive astrocytes, they have a wide variety of morphologies including processes of up to 0.95 mm (seen in the human brain). The expression of GFAP+1 positive astrocytes is linked with old age and the onset of AD pathology.

<text>Neurofilaments (NF) are classed as type IV intermediate filaments found in the cytoplasm of neurons. They are protein polymers measuring 10 nm in diameter and many micrometers in length. Together with microtubules (~25 nm) and microfilaments (7 nm), they form the neuronal cytoskeleton. They are believed to function primarily to provide structural support for axons and to regulate axon diameter, which influences nerve conduction velocity. The proteins that form neurofilaments are members of the intermediate filament protein family, which is divided into six types based on their gene organization and protein structure. Types I and II are the keratins which are expressed in epithelia. Type III contains the proteins vimentin, desmin, peripherin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Type IV consists of the neurofilament proteins NF-L, NF-M, NF-H and α-internexin. Type V consists of the nuclear lamins, and type VI consists of the protein nestin. The type IV intermediate filament genes all share two unique introns not found in other intermediate filament gene sequences, suggesting a common evolutionary origin from one primitive type IV gene.

Any proteinaceous filament that extends in the cytoplasm of a nerve cell is also termed a &quot;neurofibril&quot;. This name is used in the neurofibrillary tangles of some neurodegenerative diseases.

==Neurofilament proteins==
The protein composition of neurofilaments varies widely across different animal phyla. Most is known about mammalian neurofilaments. Historically, mammalian neurofilaments were originally thought to be composed of just three proteins called neurofilament protein NF-L (low molecular weight; NF-L), NF-M (medium molecular weight; NF-M) and NF-H (high molecular weight; NF-H). These proteins were discovered from studies of axonal transport and are often referred to as the &quot;neurofilament triplet&quot;. However, it is now clear that neurofilaments also contain the protein α-internexin and that neurofilaments in the peripheral nervous system can also contain the protein peripherin. (this is different from peripherin 2 that is expressed in the retina). Thus mammalian neurofilaments are heteropolymers of up to five different proteins: NF-L, NF-M, NF-H, α-internexin and peripherin. The five neurofilament proteins can co-assemble in different combinations in different nerve cell types and at different stages of development. The precise composition of neurofilaments in any given nerve cell depends on the relative expression levels of the neurofilament proteins in the cell at that time. For example, NF-H expression is low in developing neurons and increases postnatally in neurons with myelinated axons. In the adult nervous system neurofilaments in small unmyelinated axons contain more peripherin and less NF-H whereas neurofilaments in large myelinated axons contain more NF-H and less peripherin. The type III intermediate filament subunit, vimentin, is expressed in developing neurons and a few very unusual neurons in the adult in association with type IV proteins, such as the horizontal neurons of the retina.

The triplet proteins are named based upon their relative size (low, medium, high). The apparent molecular mass of each protein determined by SDS-PAGE is greater than the mass predicted from the amino sequence. This is due to the anomalous electrophoretic migration of these proteins and is particularly extreme for neurofilament proteins NF-M and NF-H due to their high content of charged amino acids and extensive phosphorylation. All three neurofilament triplet proteins contain long stretches of polypeptide sequence rich in glutamic acid and lysine residues, and NF-M and especially NF-H also contain multiple tandemly repeated serine phosphorylation sites. These sites almost all contain the peptide lysine-serine-proline (KSP), and phosphorylation is normally found on axonal and not dendritic neurofilaments. Human NF-M has 13 of these KSP sites, while human NF-H is expressed from two alleles one of which produces 44 and the other 45 KSP repeats.

== Neurofilament assembly and structure ==


Like other intermediate filament proteins, the neurofilament proteins all share a common central alpha helical region, known as the rod domain because of its rod-like tertiary structure, flanked by amino terminal and carboxy terminal domains that are largely unstructured. The rod domains of two neurofilament proteins dimerize to form an alpha-helical coiled coil. Two dimers associate in a staggered antiparallel manner to form a tetramer. This tetramer is believed to be the basic subunit (i.e. building block) of the neurofilament. Tetramer subunits associate side-to-side to form unit-length filaments, which then anneal end-to-end to form the mature neurofilament polymer, but the precise organization of these subunits within the polymer is not known, largely because of the heterogeneous protein composition and the inability to crystallize neurofilaments or neurofilament proteins. Structural models generally assume eight tetramers (32 neurofilament polypeptides) in a filament cross-section, but measurements of linear mass density suggest that this can vary.

The amino terminal domains of the neurofilament proteins contain numerous phosphorylation sites and appear to be important for subunit interactions during filament assembly. The carboxy terminal domains appear to be intrinsically disordered domains that lack alpha helix or beta sheet. The different sizes of the neurofilament proteins are largely due to differences in the length of the carboxy terminal domains. These domains are rich in acidic and basic amino acid residues. The carboxy terminal domains of NF-M and NF-H are the longest and are modified extensively by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation in vivo. They project radially from the filament backbone to form a dense brush border of highly charged and unstructured domains analogous to the bristles on a bottle brush. These entropically flailing domains have been proposed to define a zone of exclusion around each filament, effectively spacing the filaments apart from their neighbors. In this way, the carboxy terminal projections maximize the space-filling properties of the neurofilament polymers. By electron microscopy, these domains appear as projections called sidearms that appear to contact neighboring filaments.

== Neurofilament function ==

Neurofilaments are found in vertebrate neurons in especially high concentrations in axons, where they are all aligned in parallel along the long axis of the axon forming a continuously overlapping array. They have been proposed to function as space-filling structures that increase axonal diameter. Their contribution to axon diameter is determined by the number of neurofilaments in the axon and their packing density. The number of neurofilaments in the axon is thought to be determined by neurofilament gene expression and axonal transport. The packing density of the filaments is determined by their side-arms which define the spacing between neighboring filaments. Phosphorylation of the sidearms is thought to increase their extensibility, increasing the spacing between neighboring filaments by the binding of divalent cations between the sidearms of adjacent filaments

Early in development, axons are narrow processes that contain relatively few neurofilaments. Those axons that become myelinated accumulate more neurofilaments, which drives the expansion of their caliber. After an axon has grown and connected with its target cell, the diameter of the axon may increase as much as fivefold. This is caused by an increase in the number of neurofilaments exported from the nerve cell body as well as a slowing of their rate of transport. In mature myelinated axons, neurofilaments can be the single most abundant cytoplasmic structure and can occupy most of the axonal cross-sectional area. For example, a large myelinated axon may contain thousands of neurofilaments in one cross-section

== Neurofilament transport ==
In addition to their structural role in axons, neurofilaments are also cargoes of axonal transport. Most of the neurofilament proteins in axons are synthesized in the nerve cell body, where they rapidly assemble into neurofilament polymers within about 30 minutes. These assembled neurofilament polymers are transported along the axon on microtubule tracks powered by microtubule motor proteins. The filaments move bidirectionally, i.e. both towards the axon tip (anterograde) and towards the cell body (retrograde), but the net direction is anterograde. The filaments move at velocities of up to 8 μm/s on short time scales (seconds or minutes), with average velocities of approximately 1 μm/s. However, the average velocity on longer time scales (hours or days) is slow because the movements are very infrequent, consisting of brief sprints interrupted by long pauses. Thus on long time scales neurofilaments move in the slow component of axonal transport.

== Clinical and research applications ==

Numerous specific antibodies to neurofilament proteins have been developed and are commercially available. These antibodies can be used to detect neurofilament proteins in cells and tissues using immunofluorescence microscopy or immunohistochemistry. Such antibodies are widely used to identify neurons and their processes in histological sections and in tissue culture. The type VI intermediate filament protein Nestin is expressed in developing neurons and glia. Nestin is considered a marker of neuronal stem cells, and the presence of this protein is widely used to define neurogenesis. This protein is lost as development proceeds.

Neurofilament antibodies are also commonly used in diagnostic neuropathology. Staining with these antibodies can distinguish neurons (positive for neurofilament proteins) from glia (negative for neurofilament proteins).

There is also considerable clinical interest in the use of neurofilament proteins as biomarkers of axonal damage in diseases affecting the central nervous system. When neurons or axons degenerate, neurofilament proteins are released into the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Immunoassays of neurofilament proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma can thus serve as indicators of axonal damage in neurological disorders. NF-L levels in blood and CSF are therefore useful markers for disease monitoring in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and more recently Huntington&#x27;s disease. It has also been evaluated as a prognostic marker for functional outcome following acute ischemic stroke. Mutant mice with neurofilament abnormalities have phenotypes resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent work performed as a collaboration between EnCor Biotechnology Inc. and the University of Florida showed that the NF-L antibodies employed in the most widely used NF-L assays are specific for cleaved forms of NF-L generated by proteolysis induced by cell death. .

<text>The Livonian War (1558–1583) concerned control of Old Livonia (in the territory of present-day Estonia and Latvia). The Tsardom of Russia faced a varying coalition of the Dano-Norwegian Realm, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Union (later Commonwealth) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland.

From 1558 to 1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva. The Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland–Lithuania into the conflict, and Sweden and Denmark-Norway intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark-Norway bought the old Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state, the Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576.

In 1576, Stephen Báthory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish–Polish–Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. That was followed by an extended campaign through Russia, culminating in the long and difficult Siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland–Lithuania, Russia lost all of its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland–Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa, with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.

==Prelude==

===Pre-war Livonia===
By the mid-16th century, economically prosperous Old Livonia had become a region organised into the decentralised and religiously divided Livonian Confederation. Its territories consisted of the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order, the prince-bishoprics of Dorpat (Tartu), Ösel–Wiek, as well as Courland, the Archbishopric of Riga and the city of Riga. Together with Riga, the cities of Dorpat (Tartu) and Reval (Tallinn), along with the knightly estates, enjoyed privileges enabling them to act almost independently. The only common institutions of the Livonian estates were the regularly held common assemblies known as &quot;Landtags&quot;. As well as a divided political administration, there were also persistent rivalries between the Archbishop of Riga and the &quot;Landmeister&quot; of the Order for hegemony. A schism had existed within the Order since the Reformation had spread to Livonia in the 1520s, although the transformation of the country into a Lutheran region was a gradual process, resisted by part of the Order that to a varying degree remained sympathetic to Roman Catholicism. As war approached, Livonia had a weak administration subject to internal rivalries, lacked any powerful defences or outside support, and was surrounded by monarchies pursuing expansionist policies. Robert I. Frost notes of the volatile region: &quot;Racked with internal bickering and threatened by the political machinations of its neighbours, Livonia was in no state to resist an attack.&quot;

The Order&#x27;s &quot;Landmeister&quot; and the &quot;Gebietigers&quot;, as well as the owners of Livonian estates, were all lesser nobles who guarded their privileges and influence by preventing the creation of a higher, more powerful noble class. Only the archbishopric of Riga successfully overcame resistance of the lesser nobles. Wilhelm von Brandenburg was appointed as Archbishop of Riga and Christoph von Mecklenburg as his Coadjutor, with the help of his brother Albert (Albrecht) of Brandenburg–Ansbach, the former Prussian &quot;Hochmeister&quot; who had secularised the southern Teutonic Order state and in 1525 established himself as duke in Prussia. Wilhelm and Christoph were to pursue Albert&#x27;s interests in Livonia, among which was the establishment of a hereditary Livonian duchy styled after the Prussian model. At the same time the Order agitated for its re-establishment (&quot;Rekuperation&quot;) in Prussia, opposed secularization, and creation of a hereditary duchy.

===Aspirations of Livonia&#x27;s neighbours===

By the time the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had already lost its monopoly on the profitable and prosperous Baltic Sea trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval (Tallinn), and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the Baltic Sea, controlled the entrance to the Baltic Sea, collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.

A long bar of Danish territories in the south and lack of sufficient year-round ice-free ports severely limited Sweden&#x27;s access to Baltic trade. Nevertheless, the country prospered due to exports of timber, iron, and most notably copper, coupled with the advantages of a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow Gulf of Finland. Before the Livonian War, Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia, but the intervention of the Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.

Through its absorption of the principalities of Novgorod (1478) and Pskov (1510), the Tsardom of Russia had become Livonia&#x27;s eastern neighbour and grown stronger after annexing the khanates of Kazan (1552) and Astrakhan (1556). The conflict between Russia and the Western powers was exacerbated by Russia&#x27;s isolation from sea trade. The new Ivangorod port – built in 1550 during the reign of Tsar Ivan IV on the eastern shore of the Narva River – was considered unsatisfactory on account of its shallow waters. Thereafter the tsar demanded that the Livonian Confederation pay about 6,000 marks to keep the Bishopric of Dorpat, based on the claim that every adult male had paid Pskov one mark when it had been an independent state. The Livonians eventually promised to pay this sum to Ivan by 1557, but were sent from Moscow when they failed to do so, ending negotiations. Ivan continued to point out that the existence of the Order required passive Russian support, and was quick to threaten use of military force if necessary. He aimed to establish a corridor between the Baltic and the new territories on the Caspian Sea, because if Russia were to engage in open conflict with major western powers, it would need imports of more sophisticated weaponry.

The Polish King and Lithuanian Grand Duke Sigismund II Augustus was wary of Russian expansionist aspirations. Expansion of Russia into Livonia would have meant not only a stronger political rival but also loss of lucrative trade routes. Therefore, Sigismund supported his cousin Wilhelm von Brandenburg, archbishop of Riga, in his conflicts with Wilhelm von Fürstenberg, the Livonian Order&#x27;s &quot;landmeister&quot;. Sigismund hoped that Livonia, just like the Duchy of Prussia under Duke Albert, would become a vassal state of Poland–Lithuania. With weak support in Livonia, von Brandenburg had to largely rely on external allies. Among his few Livonian supporters was &quot;landmarschall&quot; Jasper von Munster, with whom he planned an April 1556 attack on his opponents that would involve military aid from both Sigismund and Albert. However, Sigismund hesitated over participation in the action, fearing that it would leave the Kiev Voivodeship exposed to a pending Russian attack. When von Fürstenberg learned of the plan, he led a force into the archbishopric of Riga and in June 1556 captured the main strongholds of Kokenhusen and Ronneburg. Jasper von Munster fled to Lithuania, but von Brandenburg and Christoph von Mecklenburg were captured and detained at Adsel and Treiden. This resulted in a diplomatic mission to petition for their release being dispatched by the Pomeranian dukes, the Danish King, Emperor Ferdinand I, and the estates of the Holy Roman Empire. A cross-party meeting in Lübeck to resolve the conflict was scheduled for 1 April 1557, but was cancelled due to quarrels between Sigismund and the Danish envoys. Sigismund used the killing of his envoy Lancki by the &quot;landmeister&#x27;s&quot; son as an excuse to invade the southern portion of Livonia with an army of around 80,000. He forced the competing parties in Livonia to reconcile at his camp in Pozvol in September 1557. There they signed the Treaty of Pozvol, which created a mutual defensive and offensive alliance, with its primary target Russia, and provoked the Livonian War.

==1558–1562: Dissolution of the Livonian Order==

===Russian invasion of Livonia===
Ivan IV regarded the Livonian Confederation&#x27;s approach to the Polish–Lithuanian union for protection under the Treaty of Pozvol as &quot;casus belli&quot;. In 1554 Livonia and Russia had signed a fifteen-year truce in which Livonia agreed not to enter into an alliance with Poland–Lithuania. On 22 January 1558, Ivan reacted with the invasion of Livonia. The Russians were seen by local peasants as liberators from the German control of Livonia. Many Livonian fortresses surrendered without resistance while Russian troops took Dorpat (Tartu) in May, Narva in July and laid siege to Reval (Tallinn). Reinforced by 1,200 Landsknechts, 100 gunners, and ammunition from Germany, Livonian forces successfully retook Wesenberg (Rakvere) along with a number of other fortresses. Although the Germans raided Russian territory, Dorpat (Tartu), Narva, and many lesser fortresses remained in Russian hands. The initial Russian advance was led by the Khan of Qasim Shahghali, with two other Tatar princes at the head of a force that included Russian boyars, Tatar, and Pomestnoe cavalry, as well as Cossacks, who at that time were mostly armed foot soldiers. Ivan gained further ground in campaigns during the years 1559 and 1560. In January 1559, Russian forces again invaded Livonia. A six-month truce covering May to November was signed between Russia and Livonia while Russia fought in the Russo-Crimean Wars.

Prompted by the Russian invasion, Livonia first unsuccessfully sought help from Emperor Ferdinand I, then turned to Poland–Lithuania. &quot;Landmeister&quot; von Fürstenburg fled to Poland–Lithuania to be replaced by Gotthard Kettler. In June 1559, the estates of Livonia came under Polish–Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius. The Polish &quot;sejm&quot; refused to agree to the treaty, believing it to be a matter affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In January 1560, Sigismund sent ambassador Martin Volodkov to the court of Ivan in Moscow in an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia.

Russian successes followed similar patterns featuring a multitude of small campaigns, with sieges where musketmen played a key role in destroying wooden defences with effective artillery support. The Tsar&#x27;s forces took important fortresses like Fellin (Viljandi), yet lacked the means to gain the major cities of Riga, Reval (Tallinn), or Pernau (Pärnu). The Livonian knights suffered a disastrous defeat by the Russians at the Battle of Ērģeme in August 1560. Some historians believe the Russian nobility were split over the timing of the invasion of Livonia.

Eric XIV, the new King of Sweden, turned down Kettler&#x27;s requests for assistance, along with a similar request from Poland. Kettler turned to Sigismund for help. The weakened Livonian Order was dissolved by the second Treaty of Vilnius in 1561. Its lands were secularised as the Duchy of Livonia and Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and assigned to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Kettler became the first Duke of Courland, in doing so converting to Lutheranism. Included in the treaty was the &quot;Privilegium Sigismundi Augusti&quot; by which Sigismund guaranteed the Livonian estates privileges including religious freedom with respect to the Augsburg Confession, the &quot;Indygenat&quot;, and continuation of the traditional German administration. The terms regarding religious freedom forbade any regulation of the Protestant order by religious or secular authorities.

Some members of the Lithuanian nobility opposed the growing Polish–Lithuanian union and offered the Lithuanian crown to Ivan IV. The Tsar publicly advertised this option, either because he took the offer seriously, or because he needed time to strengthen his Livonian troops. Throughout 1561, a Russo-Lithuanian truce (with a scheduled expiration date of 1562) was respected by both sides.

===Danish and Swedish interventions===

In return for a loan and a guarantee of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26 September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark-Norway the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden, Denmark-Norway made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region. Magnus at once pursued his own interests, purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick&#x27;s consent and trying to expand into Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This brought him into direct conflict with Eric.

In 1561, Swedish forces arrived and the noble corporations of Harrien–Wierland and Jerwen (Järva) yielded to Sweden to form the Duchy of Estonia. Reval (Tallinn), similarly, accepted Swedish rule. Denmark-Norway dominated the Baltic, and Sweden wished to challenge this by gaining territory on the Eastern side of the Baltic. Doing so would help Sweden control the West&#x27;s trade with Russia. This helped to precipitate the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War since in 1561, Frederick II had already protested against Swedish presence in Reval (Tallinn), claiming historical rights relating to Danish Estonia. When Eric XIV&#x27;s forces seized Pernau (Pärnu) in June 1562, his diplomats tried to arrange Swedish protection for Riga, which brought him into conflict with Sigismund.

Sigismund maintained close relations with Eric XIV&#x27;s brother, John, Duke of Finland (later John III), and in October 1562 John married Sigismund&#x27;s sister, Catherine, thereby preventing her marrying Ivan IV. While Eric XIV had approved the marriage, he was upset when John lent Sigismund 120,000 dalers and received seven Livonian castles as security. This incident led to John&#x27;s capture and imprisonment in August 1563 on Eric XIV&#x27;s behalf, whereupon Sigismund allied with Denmark and Lübeck against Eric XIV in October the same year.

==1562–1570==

The intervention of Denmark-Norway, Sweden, and Poland-Lithuania into Livonia began a period of struggle for control of the Baltic, known contemporaneously as the &quot;dominium maris baltici&quot;. While the initial war years were characterised by intensive fighting, a period of low-intensity warfare began in 1562 and lasted until 1570 when fighting once more intensified. Denmark, Sweden, and to some extent Poland–Lithuania were occupied with the Nordic Seven Years&#x27; War (1563–1570) taking place in the Western Baltic, but Livonia remained strategically important. In 1562, Denmark and Russia concluded the Treaty of Mozhaysk, respecting each other&#x27;s claims in Livonia and maintaining amicable relations. In 1564, Sweden and Russia concluded a seven-years truce. Both Ivan IV and Eric XIV showed signs of mental disorder, with Ivan IV turning against part of the Tsardom&#x27;s nobility and people with the &quot;oprichina&quot; that began in 1565, leaving Russia in a state of political chaos and civil war.

===Russian war with Lithuania===
When the Russo-Lithuanian truce expired in 1562, Ivan IV rejected Sigismund&#x27;s offer of an extension. The Tsar had used the period of the truce to build up his forces in Livonia, and he invaded Lithuania. His army raided Vitebsk and, after a series of border clashes, took Polotsk in 1563. Lithuanian victories came at the Battle of Ula in 1564 and at Czasniki (Chashniki) in 1567, a period of intermittent conflict between the two sides. Ivan continued to gain ground among the towns and villages of central Livonia but was held at the coast by Lithuania. The defeats of Ula and Czasniki, along with the defection of Andrey Kurbsky, led Ivan IV to move his capital to the Alexandrov Kremlin while the perceived opposition against him was repressed by his &quot;oprichniki&quot;.

A &quot;grand&quot; party of diplomats left Lithuania for Moscow in May 1566. Lithuania was prepared to split Livonia with Russia, with a view to a joint offensive to drive Sweden from the area. However, this was seen as a sign of weakness by Russian diplomats, who instead suggested that Russia take the whole of Livonia, including Riga, through the ceding of Courland in southern Livonia and Polotsk on the Lithuanian–Russian border. The transfer of Riga, and the surrounding entrance to the River Dvina, troubled the Lithuanians, since much of their trade depended on safe passage through it and they had already built fortifications to protect it. Ivan expanded his demands in July, calling for Ösel in addition to Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva. No agreement was forthcoming and a ten-day break was taken in negotiations, during which time various Russian meetings were held (including the &quot;zemsky sobor&quot;, the &quot;Assembly of the Land&quot;) to discuss the issues at stake. Within the Assembly, the church&#x27;s representative stressed the need to &quot;keep&quot; Riga (though it had not yet been conquered), while the Boyars were less keen on an overall peace with Lithuania, noting the danger posed by a joint Polish-Lithuanian state. Talks were then halted and hostilities resumed upon the return of the ambassadors to Lithuania.

In 1569, the Treaty of Lublin unified Poland and Lithuania into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno in 1566, came under Polish–Lithuanian joint sovereignty. In June 1570 a three-year truce was signed with Russia. Sigismund II, the Commonwealth&#x27;s first King, died in 1572 leaving the Polish throne with no clear successor for the first time since 1382 and thus began the first free election in Polish history. Some Lithuanian nobles, in an effort to retain Lithuanian autonomy, proposed a Russian candidate. Ivan, however, demanded the return of Kiev, an Orthodox coronation, and a hereditary monarchy in parallel to Russia&#x27;s, with his son, Feodor, as King. The electorate rejected these demands and instead chose Henry of Valois (&quot;Henryk Walezy&quot;), brother of King Charles IX of France.

===Russian war with Sweden===

In 1564, Sweden and Russia agreed the Treaty of Dorpat, whereby Russia recognised Sweden&#x27;s right to Reval (Tallinn) and other castles, and Sweden accepted Russia&#x27;s patrimony over the rest of Livonia. A seven-year truce was signed between Russia and Sweden in 1565. Eric XIV of Sweden was overthrown in 1568 after he killed several nobles in the Sture Murders (&quot;Sturemorden&quot;) of 1567, and was replaced by his half-brother John III. Both Russia and Sweden had other problems and were keen to avoid an expensive escalation of the war in Livonia. Ivan IV had requested the delivery of John&#x27;s wife, the Polish-Lithuanian princess Catherine Jagellonica, to Russia, since he had competed with John to marry into the Lithuanian-Polish royal family. In July 1569 John sent a party to Russia, led by Paul Juusten, Bishop of Åbo, which arrived in Novgorod in September, following the arrival in Moscow of the ambassadors sent to Sweden in 1567 by Ivan to retrieve Catherine. Ivan refused to meet with the party himself, forcing them to negotiate instead with the Governor of Novgorod. The Tsar requested that Swedish envoys should greet the governor as &#x27;the brother of their king&#x27;, but Juusten refused to do so. The Governor then ordered an attack on the Swedish party, that their clothes and money be taken, and that they be deprived of food and drink and be paraded naked through the streets.

Although the Swedes were also to be moved to Moscow, this occurred at the same time Ivan and his &quot;oprichniki&quot; were on their way to launch an assault on Novgorod in northern Russia. In an act of vengeance against the perceived treason of the local Orthodox church in Novgorod, Ivan&#x27;s forces launched an attack on the city, where 2,000–15,000 people were killed.

On his return to Moscow in May 1570, Ivan refused to meet the Swedish party, and with the signing of a three-year truce in June 1570 with the Commonwealth he no longer feared war with Poland–Lithuania. Russia considered the delivery of Catherine to be a precondition of any deal, and the Swedes agreed to meet in Novgorod to discuss the matter. According to Juusten, at the meeting the Russians demanded the Swedes to abandon their claim to Reval (Tallinn), provide two or three hundred cavalry when required, pay 10,000 thaler in direct compensation, surrender Finnish silver mines near the border with Russia, and allow the Tsar to style himself &quot;Lord of Sweden&quot;. The Swedish party left following an ultimatum from Ivan that Sweden should cede its territory in Livonia or there would be war. Juusten was left behind while John rejected Ivan&#x27;s demands, and war broke out anew.

===Impact of the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War===
Quarrels between Denmark-Norway and Sweden led to the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War in 1563, which ended in 1570 with the Treaty of Stettin. Primarily fought in western and southern Scandinavia, the war involved important naval battles fought in the Baltic. When Danish-held Varberg surrendered to Swedish forces in 1565, 150 Danish mercenaries escaped the subsequent massacre of the garrison by defecting to Sweden. Among them was Pontus de la Gardie, who thereafter became an important Swedish commander in the Livonian War. Livonia was also affected by the naval campaign of Danish admiral Peder Munk, who bombarded Swedish Reval (Tallinn) from sea in July 1569.

The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark the supreme and dominating power in Northern Europe, yet failed to restore the Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led to a series of conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and thus the Livonian War continued. From Ivan&#x27;s point of view, the treaty enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him, now that they were no longer fighting each other.

==1570–1577: Russian dominance and the Kingdom of Livonia==
During the early 1570s, King John III of Sweden faced a Russian offensive on his positions in Estonia. Reval (Tallinn) withstood a Russian siege in 1570 and 1571, but several smaller towns were taken by Russian forces. On 23 January a Swedish army of 700 infantry and 600 cavalry under command of Clas Åkesson Tott (the Elder) clashed with a Russian and Tartar army of 16,000 men under the command of Khan Sain-Bulat at the Battle of Lode by the village of Koluvere. The Russian advance concluded with the sacking of Weissenstein (Paide) in 1573, where, after its capture, the occupying forces roasted some of the leaders of the Swedish garrison alive, including the commander. This triggered a retaliatory campaign by John centred on Wesenberg, to which the army departed in November 1573 with Klas Åkesson Tott in overall command and Pontus de la Gardie as field commander. There were also Russian raids into Finland, including one as far as Helsingfors (Helsinki) in 1572. A two-year truce on this front was signed in 1575.

John&#x27;s counter-offensive stalled at the siege of Wesenberg in 1574, when German and Scottish units of the Swedish army turned against each other. This failure has also been blamed on the difficulties of fighting in the bitter winter conditions, particularly for the infantry. The war in Livonia was a great financial burden for Sweden, and by the end of 1573, Sweden&#x27;s German mercenaries were owed 200,000 &quot;daler&quot;. John gave them the castles of Hapsal, Leal, and Lode as security, but when he failed to pay they were sold to Denmark.

Meanwhile, efforts by Magnus to besiege Swedish-controlled Reval (Tallinn) were faltering, with support from neither Ivan nor Magnus&#x27; brother, Frederick II of Denmark forthcoming. Ivan&#x27;s attention was focused elsewhere, while Frederick&#x27;s reluctance perhaps stemmed from a new spirit of Swedish–Danish unity that made him unwilling to invade Livonia on behalf of Magnus, whose state was a vassal of Russia. The siege was abandoned in March 1571, whereupon Swedish action in the Baltic escalated, with the passive backing of Sigismund, John&#x27;s brother-in-law.

At the same time Crimean Tatars devastated Russian territories and burned and looted Moscow during the Russo-Crimean Wars. Drought and epidemics had fatally affected the Russian economy while &quot;oprichnina&quot; had thoroughly disrupted the government. Following the defeat of Crimean and Nogai forces in 1572, &quot;oprichnina&quot; was wound down and with it the way Russian armies were formed also changed. Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy whereby he relied on tens of thousands of native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.

Ivan&#x27;s campaign reached its height in 1576 when another 30,000 Russian soldiers crossed into Livonia in 1577 and devastated Danish areas in retaliation for the Danish acquisition of Hapsal, Leal, and Lode. Danish influence in Livonia ceased, as Frederick accepted deals with Sweden and Poland to end nominal Danish involvement. Swedish forces were besieged in Reval (Tallinn) and central Livonia raided as far as Dünaburg (Daugavpils), formally under Polish–Lithuanian control since the 1561 Treaty of Vilnius. The conquered territories submitted to Ivan or his vassal, Magnus, declared monarch of the Kingdom of Livonia in 1570. Magnus defected from Ivan IV during the same year, having started to appropriate castles without consulting the Tsar. When Kokenhusen (Koknese) submitted to Magnus to avoid fighting Ivan IV&#x27;s army, the Tsar sacked the town and executed its German commanders. The campaign then focussed on Wenden (Cēsis, Võnnu), &quot;the heart of Livonia&quot;, which as the former capital of the Livonian Order was not only of strategic importance, but also symbolic of Livonia itself.

==1577–1583: Defeat of Russia==

===Swedish and Polish–Lithuanian alliance and counter-offensives===

In 1576, the Transylvanian prince Stephen Báthory became King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania after a contested election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne with the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian II. Both Báthory&#x27;s fiancée Anna Jagiellon and Maximilian II had been proclaimed elected to the same throne in December 1575, three days apart; Maximilan&#x27;s death in October 1576 prevented the conflict from escalating. Báthory, ambitious to expel Ivan IV from Livonia, was constrained by the opposition of Danzig (Gdansk), which resisted Báthory&#x27;s accession with Danish support. The ensuing Danzig War of 1577 ended when Báthory conceded further autonomous rights to the city in return for a payment of 200,000 zlotys. For a further 200,000 zloty payment, he appointed Hohenzollern George Frederick as administrator of Prussia and secured the latter&#x27;s military support in the planned campaign against Russia.

Báthory received only few soldiers from his Polish vassals and was forced to recruit mercenaries, primarily Poles, Hungarians, Bohemians, Germans, and Wallachians. A separate Szekler brigade fought in Livonia.

Swedish King John III and Stephen Báthory allied against Ivan IV in December 1577, despite problems caused by the death of Sigismund which meant that the issue of the substantial inheritance due to John&#x27;s wife, Catherine, had not been resolved. Poland also claimed the whole of Livonia, without accepting Swedish rule of any part of it. The 120,000 &quot;daler&quot; lent in 1562 had still not been repaid, despite Sigismund&#x27;s best intentions to settle it.

By November, Lithuanian forces moving northward had captured Dünaburg while a Polish–Swedish force took the town and castle of Wenden in early 1578. Russian forces failed to retake the town in February, an attack followed by a Swedish offensive, targeting Pernau (Pärnu), Dorpat, and Novgorod among others. In September, Ivan responded by sending in an army of 18,000 men, who recaptured Oberpahlen (Põltsamaa) from Sweden and then marched on Wenden. Upon their arrival at Wenden, the Russian army laid siege to the town, but was met by a relief force of around 6,000 German, Polish, and Swedish soldiers. In the ensuing Battle of Wenden, Russian casualties were severe with armaments and horses captured, leaving Ivan IV with his first serious defeat in Livonia.

Báthory accelerated the formation of the hussars, a new well-organised cavalry troop that replaced the feudal levy. Similarly, he improved an already effective artillery system and recruited cossacks. Báthory gathered 56,000 troops, 30,000 of them from Lithuania, for his first assault on Russia at Polotsk, as part of a wider campaign. With Ivan&#x27;s reserves in Pskov and Novgorod to guard against a possible Swedish invasion, the city fell on 30 August 1579. Báthory then appointed a close ally and powerful member of his court, Jan Zamoyski, to lead a force of 48,000, including 25,000 men from Lithuania, against the fortress of Velikie Luki which he went on to capture on 5 September 1580. Without further significant resistance, garrisons such as Sokol, Velizh, and Usvzat fell quickly. In 1581, the force besieged Pskov, a well-fortified and heavily defended fortress. However, financial support from the Polish parliament was dropping, and Báthory failed to lure Russian forces in Livonia out into open field before the onset of winter. Not realising that the Polish–Lithuanian advance was on the wane, Ivan signed the Truce of Jam Zapolski.

The failure of the Swedish siege of Narva in 1579 led to Pontus de la Gardie&#x27;s appointment as commander-in-chief. The towns of Kexholm and Padise were taken by Swedish forces in 1580, then in 1581, concurrent with the fall of Wesenberg, a mercenary army hired by Sweden recaptured the strategic city of Narva. A target of John III&#x27;s campaigns, since it could be attacked by both land and sea, the campaign made use of Sweden&#x27;s considerable fleet but later arguments over formal control in the long term hampered any alliance with Poland. Following la Gardie&#x27;s taking of the city, and in retaliation for previous Russian massacres, 7,000 Russians were killed according to Russow&#x27;s contemporary chronicle. The fall of Narva was followed by those of Ivangorod, Jama, and Koporye, leaving Sweden content with its gains in Livonia.

===Truces of Jam Zapolski and Plussa===

Subsequent negotiations led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino resulted in the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, in part because he requested the truce. Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held and the city of Dorpat (Tartu) to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territory—specifically Narva—could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Báthory&#x27;s control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III&#x27;s wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Báthory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Báthory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva.

Following a decision by John, the war with Russia ended when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa (&quot;Plyussa, Pljussa, Plusa&quot;) with Sweden on 10 August 1583. Russia relinquished most of Ingria, leaving Narva and Ivangorod as well under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590. During the negotiations, Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory, including Novgorod. Whilst these conditions were probably only for the purposes of negotiation, they may have reflected Swedish aspirations of territory in the region.

==Aftermath==

The post-war Duchy of Courland and Semigallia south of the Düna (Daugava) river experienced a period of political stability based on the 1561 Treaty of Vilnius, later modified by the 1617 &quot;Formula regiminis&quot; and &quot;Statuta Curlandiæ&quot;, which granted indigenous nobles additional rights at the duke&#x27;s expense. North of the Düna, Báthory reduced the privileges Sigismund had granted the Duchy of Livonia, regarding the regained territories as the spoils of war. Riga&#x27;s privileges had already been reduced by the Treaty of Drohiczyn in 1581. Polish gradually replaced German as the administrative language and the establishment of voivodeships reduced the Baltic German administration. The local clergy and the Jesuits in Livonia embraced the Counter-Reformation in a process assisted by Báthory, who gave the Roman Catholic Church revenues and estates confiscated from Protestants as well as initiating a largely unsuccessful recruitment campaign for Catholic colonists. Despite these measures, the Livonian population did not convert &quot;en masse&quot;, while the Livonian estates in Poland–Lithuania were alienated.
In 1590, the Russo-Swedish truce of Plussa expired and fighting resumed while the ensuing Russo-Swedish War of 1590–5 ended with the Treaty of Teusina (Tyavzino, Tyavzin), under which Sweden had to cede Ingria and Kexholm to Russia. The Swedish–Polish alliance began to crumble when the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund III, who as son of John III of Sweden (died 1592) and Catherine Jagellonica, was the successor to the Swedish throne, met with resistance from a faction led by his uncle, Charles of Södermanland (later Charles IX), who claimed regency in Sweden for himself. Sweden descended into a civil war in 1597, followed by the 1598–1599 war against Sigismund, which ended with the deposition of Sigismund by the Swedish &quot;riksdag&quot;.

Local nobles turned to Charles for protection in 1600 when the conflict spread to Livonia, where Sigismund had tried to incorporate Swedish Estonia into the Duchy of Livonia. Charles then expelled the Polish forces from Estonia and invaded the Livonian duchy, starting a series of Polish–Swedish wars. At the same time, Russia was embroiled in civil war over the vacant Russian throne (&quot;Time of Troubles&quot;) when none of the many claimants had prevailed. This conflict became intertwined with the Livonian campaigns when Swedish and Polish–Lithuanian forces intervened on opposite sides, the latter starting the Polish–Muscovite War. Charles IX&#x27;s forces were expelled from Livonia after major setbacks at the battles of Kokenhausen(1601) and Kircholm (1605). During the later Ingrian War, Charles&#x27; successor Gustavus Adolphus retook Ingria and Kexholm which were formally ceded to Sweden under the 1617 Treaty of Stolbovo along with the bulk of the Duchy of Livonia. In 1617, when Sweden had recovered from the Kalmar War with Denmark, several Livonian towns were captured, but only Pernau (Pärnu) remained under Swedish control after a Polish–Lithuanian counter-offensive. A second campaign then started with the capture of Riga in 1621 and expelled Polish–Lithuanian forces from most of Livonia, where the dominion of Swedish Livonia was created. Swedish forces then advanced through Royal Prussia and Poland–Lithuania accepted Swedish gains in Livonia in the 1629 Treaty of Altmark.

The Danish province of Øsel was ceded to Sweden under the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, which ended the Torstenson War, one theatre of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. It was retained after the Peace of Oliva and the Treaty of Copenhagen, both in 1660. The situation remained unchanged until 1710 when Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Russia during the Great Northern War, an action formalised in the Treaty of Nystad (1721).

<text>A gastrointestinal cocktail, (also known as a GI cocktail or gastric cocktail), is a mixture of medications used to treat symptoms of dyspepsia. The GI cocktail generally contains a mixture of viscous lidocaine, an antacid, and an anticholinergic. The GI cocktail is commonly prescribed in the hospital or emergency department, and has been used to help distinguish chest pain as either gastrointestinal or cardiac. While it has been widely used in the treatment of dyspepsia, studies have suggested that the GI cocktail is only as effective as antacids alone.

The &quot;GI cocktail&quot; does not refer to a specific product. Rather, it refers to a mixture of viscous lidocaine, an antacid, and an anticholinergic. Viscous lidocaine works as an anesthetic to numb pain in the throat, esophagus, and stomach. Antacids work to neutralize stomach acid. Anticholinergics work to ease symptoms that accompany dyspepsia including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping.

== Contents and dosing ==
The GI cocktail is a mixture of a viscous anesthetic, an antacid, and an anticholinergic. Common viscous anesthetics use are viscous lidocaine or xylocaine. Common antacids used are magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, or simethicone (more commonly known as Mylanta or Maalox). Common anticholinergics used are hyoscyamine sulfate, atropine sulfate, scopolamine hydrobromide, and phenobarbital (more commonly known as Donnatal). Typical dosing is 5ml of viscous anesthetic, 30ml of liquid antacid, and 10ml of anticholinergic.

== Medical uses ==
The GI cocktail is commonly prescribed in the hospital or emergency department to treat symptoms of dyspepsia. These symptoms include: belching, heartburn, chest pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, nausea, loss of appetite, and flatulence. Dyspepsia itself is not an illness, rather it is an indicator of chronic underlying gastrointestinal issues such as peptic ulcer disease, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, &quot;H. pylori&quot; gastritis, gastroparesis, or upper gastrointestinal cancers. Dyspepsia can additionally be contributed to medications such as potassium supplements, NSAIDs, digitalis, iron, glucocorticoids, and colchicine, as well as lifestyle factors such as diet, stress, and cigarette smoking.

== Side effects ==
Some people experience side effects that are the result of the individual medications used to make the GI cocktail. They include:

Viscous lidocaine:
* Allergic reaction such as rash, itching, or hives. Swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth, face, and throat is possible in severe cases 
* Numbness/tingling
* Visual changes 
* Nervousness
* Confusion
* Chest pain
* Seizures
* Difficulty breathing 
Antacid:
* Allergic reaction such as rash, itching, or hives. Swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth, face, and throat is possible in severe cases 
* Stomach cramps 
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Headache
Anticholinergic:
* Dry mouth
* Blurry vision
* Dry eyes
* Constipation
* Urinary retention
* Dizziness 
* Confusion
* Heart arrhythmia

== Efficacy ==
Prior studies regarding the GI cocktail for management of dyspepsia in the emergency department have varied in quality of methodology and have demonstrated mixed results. A 1990 single-blind study performed by Welling and Watson compared 30 mL of antacid with or without the addition of 15 mL of viscous lidocaine and concluded that the addition of viscous lidocaine provided a significantly greater degree of immediate pain relief than antacids alone in patients with dyspepsia. A 2004 single-blind study performed by Vike and Davis, compared treatment with antacids plus either viscous lidocaine or benzocaine solution and did not find a statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms – however the study lacked an antacid monotherapy arm. A robust double-blind clinical trial performed in 2003 by Berman et al. compared 30 mL of antacid monotherapy, antacid with the addition of 10 ml of an anticholinergic, and an antacid with anticholinergic with the addition of 10 mL of 2% viscous lidocaine. That study demonstrated no statistically significant difference in pain relief between treatment arms and concluded that all treatments were clinically effective. The ultimately recommended antacid monotherapy alone in the treatment of dyspepsia.

<text>Middleport is a residential and industrial district in the city of Stoke-on-Trent, England. Middleport lies to the west of Burslem, between Burslem and the Newcastle-under-Lyme district of Porthill. To the north is Tunstall and to the south Cobridge and Etruria. Middleport conjoins Longport.

Middleport is primarily residential, with distinctive Victorian terraced houses. However, it also a working industrial district and contains several potteries: ranging from Middleport Pottery, owned by Re-Form Heritage and claimed to be the only working Victorian pottery remaining in the city, and Steelite, a large manufacturer of hotelware.

The Trent and Mersey Canal and a key path of the National Cycle Network run through Middleport. The line of the canal through the City of Stoke-on-Trent is a linear conservation area. Middleport contains one of the nation&#x27;s richest stretches of canalside industrial heritage. Since 1990 the canal area has benefited from around £1m of Groundwork funding, and £4m of Townscape Heritage funding. Clarice Cliff&#x27;s Newport Pottery, where she produced some of her most famous work, was adjacent to the canal and an artist-designed 12-foot steel markerpost identifies the location.

Middleport is an area that is strategic to the regeneration of the city, as it sits in the centre of a ring of imminent projects totalling around £250m: the Chatterley Valley scheme, the Etruria Valley scheme, the regeneration of Burslem town centre, and a proposed major &quot;park and ride&quot; interchange and business-park on the site of the old Shelton Bar steel rolling-mill.

Middleport piloted a community warden service in 2002 &amp; 2003; as a result, crime dropped by 80 per cent. The service was subsequently extended across Stoke-on-Trent and adopted in other cities.

Middleport features in several of the novels of Arnold Bennett, and the film version of his &quot;The Card&quot; was filmed in Middleport with Alec Guinness.

Middleport Park Bowling Club has a national reputation and has won several national trophies.

Middleport Matters (founded 2015) is a local community action group dedicated to improving the lives of those who live and work in Middleport and the surrounding areas.

<text>Gaekwads (also spelled as Gaikwads, Guicowars, Gaekwars) (IAST: &quot;Gāyakavāḍa&quot;), a Hindu Maratha dynasty of the former Maratha Confederacy and its subsequent (erstwhile) princely state of Baroda in western India from the early 18th century until 1947. The ruling prince was known as the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda. With the city of Baroda (Vadodara) as its capital, during the British Raj its relations with the British were managed by the Baroda Residency. It was one of the largest and wealthiest princely states existing alongside British India, with wealth coming from the lucrative cotton business as well as rice, wheat and sugar production.

==Early history==

The Gaekwad rule of Baroda began when the Maratha general Pilaji Rao Gaekwad conquered the city from the Mughal Empire in 1721. The Gaekwads were granted the city as a Jagir by Chhatrapati Shahu I, the Chhatrapati of the Maratha Confederacy.

In their early years, the Gaekwads served as subordinates of the Dabhade family, who were the Maratha chiefs of Gujarat and holders of the &quot;senapati&quot; (commander-in-chief) title. When Umabai Dabhade joined Tarabai&#x27;s side against Balaji Baji Rao, Pilaji&#x27;s son Damaji Rao Gaekwad commanded the Dabhade force. He was defeated, and remained under Peshwa&#x27;s arrest from May 1751 to March 1752. In 1752, he was released after agreeing to abandon the Dabhades and accept the Peshwa&#x27;s suzerainty. In return, Damaji was made the Maratha chief of Gujarat, and the Peshwa helped him expel the Mughals from Gujarat.

Damaji subsequently fought alongside Sadashiv Rao, Vishwas Rao, Malhar Rao Holkar, Jankoji Scindia, Sidhoji Gharge-Desai (Deshmukh) and Mahadji Shinde in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). After the Maratha defeat at Panipat, the central rule of the Peshwas was weakened. As a result, the Gaekwads, along with several other powerful Maratha clans, established themselves as virtually independent rulers, while recognizing the nominal authority of the Peshwas and suzerainty of the Bhonsle Maharaja of Satara.

==British suzerainty==

The Gaekwads, together with several Maratha chieftains, fought the British in the First Anglo-Maratha War.

On 15 March 1802, the British intervened to defend the Gaekwad Maharaja, Anand Rao Gaekwad, who had recently inherited the throne against rival claimants, and the Gaekwads concluded the Treaty of Cambey with the British that recognized their independence from the Maratha Confederacy and guaranteed the Maharajas of Baroda local autonomy in return for recognizing British suzerainty, though it was a result of an inability to overpower them.

Maharaja Sayaji Rao III, who took the throne in 1875, did much to modernize Baroda, establishing compulsory primary education, a library system and the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. He also encouraged the setting up of textile factories, which helped create Baroda&#x27;s textile industry. He is well known for offering B. R. Ambedkar a scholarship to study at Columbia University.

Upon India attaining its independence in 1947, the last ruling Maharaja of Baroda, Pratapsinhrao, acceded to India. Baroda was eventually merged with Bombay State, which was later divided, based on linguistic principle, into the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in 1960.

Gaekwad or Gayakwad also survives as a fairly common Maratha surname, found mainly in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

<text>Industrial district (ID) is a place where workers and firms, specialised in a main industry and auxiliary industries, live and work. The concept was initially used by Alfred Marshall to describe some aspects of the industrial organisation of nations. At the end of the 1990s the industrial districts in developed or developing countries had gained a recognised attention in international debates on industrialisation and policies of regional development.

==History of the term==

The term was used the first time by Alfred Marshall in &quot;The Principles of Economics&quot; (1890, 1922) and in his &quot;Industry and Trade&quot; Marshall talks of a... &quot;thickly peopled industrial district&quot;.

The term was also used in political struggle. The 1917 handbook of the Industrial Workers of the World states:-

: &quot;In order that every given industrial district shall have complete industrial solidarity among the workers in all industries as well as among the workers of each an INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT COUNCIL is formed ...&quot;

The term also appears in English literature. For instance, in a short story of 1920 by D. H. Lawrence, &quot;You Touched Me&quot; (aka &#x27;Hadrian&#x27;):-

: &quot;Matilda and Emmie were already old maids. In a thorough industrial district, it is not easy for the girls who have expectations above the common to find husbands. The ugly industrial town was full of men, young men who were ready to marry. But they were all colliers or pottery-hands, mere workmen.&quot;

The strong specialisation of the workers and an appropriate support of public goods and institutions are supported by an &quot;Industrial Atmosphere&quot; related to a locally developing division of labour. Competences and knowledge are shared in informal way with processes of learning by doing and learning by using, and this promotes innovation over time. Local firms, families and civic organisations are connected by way of both market mechanisms and non-market mechanisms, like trust within bilateral or team exchanges, and collective action supporting the availability of local industrial, social and environmental infrastructure. Also, the notion that firms located in geographical proximity benefit from agglomeration effects in having a common or collective infrastructure is frequently mentioned as one of the main bases in the industrial district literature.

==Recent evolution of the use of the term==
Within the study of economics, the term has evolved. Giacomo Becattini rediscovered the concept to describe the Italian industrial configuration of the middle of the 20th century. Since the 1980s, the dynamic industrial development in NEC (North, East and Centre) of Italy, where after the Second World War geographical concentration of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) raised up, led to an increasing attention to the Marshall&#x27; seminal works. A growing literature with an accompanying cloud of definitions of what is meant as an industrial district characterised the international dabate, e.g. Cluster. Industrial districts in Italy have a coherent location and a narrow specialisation profile, e.g. Prato in woollen fabric, Sassuolo in ceramic tiles or Brenta in ladies&#x27; footwear.

The success of SME-based Italian districts in the last century and the alternate fortunes of the current ones led to investigate more thoroughly some related aspects. The general characteristics of the ID are consistent with gradual change supported by processes of innovation from below, or decentralized industrial creativity. However, the globalisation processes asked non-gradual changes to the historical IDs and technical and organisational difficulties could hit them.

In the Industry 4.0 era, the specialised capabilities of these areas seem to have the possibility to encourage the emergence of the New Artisans, Maker in the context of adapted models like the &quot;ID mark 3.0&quot;.

<doc id="1300537" wikidata="Q766956" url="?curid=1300537" title="Karnaphuli">
<text>The Karnaphuli River ( &quot;Kôrnophuli&quot;; also spelt Karnafuli and Khawthlangtuipui in Mizo, meaning &quot;western river&quot; and Borgang in Chakma, meaning &quot;Big River&quot;) is the largest and most important river in Chittagong and the Chittagong Hill Tracts. It is a wide river in the south-eastern part of Bangladesh. Originating from the Saithah village of Mamit district in Mizoram, India, it flows southwest through Chattogram Hill Tracts and Chattogram into the Bay of Bengal. It is the fastest flowing river in Bangladesh, after the Padma. It is said to &quot;represent the drainage system of the whole south-western part of Mizoram.&quot; Principal tributaries include the Kawrpui River or Thega River, Tuichawng River and Phairuang River. A large hydroelectric power plant was built on the Karnaphuli in the Kaptai region in the 1960s. The mouth of the river hosts the Port of Chattogram, the largest and busiest seaport of Bangladesh.

==Etymology==
The presence of Arab traders and merchants in the history of Chittagong led to many areas in Chittagong to have names of Arabic origin. The name of this river is thought to have come from &quot;qarnaful&quot;, the Arabic word for clove, and refers to an incident in which an Arab ship full of cloves sank in this river.

==Course==
===Chittagong City===
Chittagong is situated on the banks of the Karnaphuli River between the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the Bay of Bengal. The city is a noteworthy seaside seaport city and monetary focus in southeastern Bangladesh. The Chittagong Metropolitan Area has a populace of more than 8.9 million, making it the second biggest city in Bangladesh. It is the capital of an eponymous locale and division. A water treatment plant has been set up by Chittagong Port Authority to source water from the Karnaphuli river for its uses. The plant will make the port self-reliant in its water needs.

===Tlabung===
Tlabung is situated on the banks of the Karnaphuli River in Lunglei district, Mizoram. Karnaphuli River links Mizoram with the port cit of Chittagong on the shores of Bay of Bengal. British Troops and missionaries used this route to reach Mizoram during the Colonial days. It used to take 5 days to reach from Chittagong to Tlabung on a motorboat, a distance of about 90 kilometers, after which they would travel another 35 kilometers to reach Lunglei.

==Transport==

The government had awarded a contract to build a two lane Karnaphuli tunnel underneath the Karnaphuli river to China Communication Construction Company (CCCC). This is the first underwater tunnel in Bangladesh. CCCC received $706 million for its services, with total costs expected to be over $1 billion.

==Kaptai dam==

The Kaptai Dam is the location of the Karnafuli Hydroelectric Power Station, constructed in Kaptai in 1962 and the only hydroelectric power plant in the country. An earth-filled dam on the Karnaphuli River, the Kaptai Dam, created the Kaptai Lake, which acts as the water reservoir for the hydropower station. The power plant produces a total of 230 megawatts of electricity. When then east Pakistan built the dam, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru didn&#x27;t object even though it resulted in part of Indian side getting submerged and inflow of more than 40000 refugees.

==Pollution==
Like many rivers in Bangladesh, Karnaphuli is heavily polluted by agricultural runoff. Reducing the amount of oxygen available and harming aquatic life in the river. In 2015, a train carrying oil crashed over a tributary of the river. The spill caused environmental degradation.

==Aquatic life==
The river is home to the Ganges river dolphin, which is an endangered species. Hilsa used to be common in the river, but have nearly disappeared from the river due to pollution.

<doc id="1300540" wikidata="Q4460752" url="?curid=1300540" title="Quebec Agreement">
<text>The Quebec Agreement was a secret agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States outlining the terms for the coordinated development of the science and engineering related to nuclear energy and specifically nuclear weapons. It was signed by Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt on 19 August 1943, during World War II, at the First Quebec Conference in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.

The Quebec Agreement stipulated that the US and UK would pool their resources to develop nuclear weapons, and that neither country would use them against the other, or against other countries without mutual consent, or pass information about them to other countries. It also gave the United States a veto over post-war British commercial or industrial uses of nuclear energy. The agreement merged the British Tube Alloys project with the American Manhattan Project, and created the Combined Policy Committee to control the joint project. Although Canada was not a signatory, the Agreement provided for a Canadian representative on the Combined Policy Committee in view of Canada&#x27;s contribution to the effort.

British scientists performed important work as part of the British contribution to the Manhattan Project, and in July 1945 British permission required by the agreement was given for the use of nuclear weapons against Japan. The September 1944 Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire extended Anglo-American co-operation into the post-war period, but after the war ended, American enthusiasm for the alliance with Britain waned. The McMahon Act (1946) ended technical co-operation through its control of &quot;restricted data&quot;. On 7 January 1948, the Quebec Agreement was superseded by a &quot;modus vivendi&quot;, an agreement which allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada.

== Background ==
=== Tube Alloys ===

The neutron was discovered by James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in February 1932. In April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split lithium atoms with accelerated protons. Then, in December 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at Hahn&#x27;s laboratory in Berlin-Dahlem bombarded uranium with slowed neutrons, and discovered that barium had been produced. Hahn wrote to his colleague Lise Meitner, who, with her nephew Otto Frisch, explained that the uranium nucleus had been split. By analogy with the division of biological cells, they named the process &quot;fission&quot;.
The discovery of fission raised the possibility that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created. The term was already familiar to the British public through the writings of H. G. Wells, in his 1913 novel &quot;The World Set Free&quot;. Sir Henry Tizard&#x27;s Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defence was originally formed to study the needs of anti-aircraft warfare, but branched out to study air warfare generally. In May 1939, a few months before the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in September 1939, it was directed to conduct research into the feasibility of atomic bombs. Tizard tasked George Paget Thomson, the professor of physics at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson&#x27;s team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing.

Oliphant&#x27;s team reached a strikingly different conclusion. He had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Frisch, who could not work on the university&#x27;s secret projects like radar because they were enemy aliens, and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. They calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as would suffice, and would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.

Oliphant took the Frisch–Peierls memorandum to Tizard. As a result, the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort. Four universities provided the locations where the experiments were taking place. The University of Birmingham undertook theoretical work, such as determining what size of critical mass was needed for an explosion. This group was run by Peierls, with the help of fellow German refugee scientist Klaus Fuchs. The laboratories at the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford experimented with different types of isotope separation. Chadwick&#x27;s group at Liverpool dealt with thermal diffusion, a phenomenon observed in mixtures of mobile particles where the different particle types exhibit different responses to the force of a temperature gradient. Francis Simon&#x27;s group at Oxford investigated the gaseous diffusion, which works on the principle that at differing pressures uranium 235 would diffuse through a barrier faster than uranium 238. This was determined to be the most promising method. Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather&#x27;s group at Cambridge investigated whether another element, now called plutonium, could be used as a fissile material. Because of the presence of a team of refugee French scientists led by Hans von Halban, Oxford also had the world&#x27;s main supply of heavy water, which helped them theorise how uranium could be used for power.

In July 1941, the MAUD Committee produced two comprehensive reports that concluded that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The MAUD Committee unanimously recommended pursuing its development as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. But even before its report was completed, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, had been briefed on its findings by his scientific advisor, Frederick Lindemann, and had decided on a course of action. A new directorate known by the deliberately misleading name of Tube Alloys was created to co-ordinate this effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, became the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed its director.

=== Early American efforts ===

The prospect of Germany developing an atomic bomb was also of great concern to scientists in the United States, particularly those who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. In July 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein had written a letter warning the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, of the danger. In response, Roosevelt created an Advisory Committee on Uranium in October 1939, chaired by Lyman Briggs of the National Bureau of Standards. Research concentrated on slow fission for power production, but with a growing interest in isotope separation. On 12 June 1940, Vannevar Bush, the president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Harry Hopkins, a key advisor to the president, went to the president with a proposal to create a National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) to co-ordinate defence-related research. The NDRC was formally created on 27 June 1940, with Bush as its chairman. It absorbed the Advisory Committee on Uranium which had gone beyond its original role and was now directing research. It became the Uranium Committee of the NDRC.
One of Bush&#x27;s first actions as the chairman of the NDRC was to arrange a clandestine meeting with Air Commodore George Pirie, the British air attaché in Washington, and Brigadier Charles Lindemann, the British Army attaché (and Frederick Lindemann&#x27;s brother), to discuss a British offer of a full exchange of technical information. Bush was strongly in favour of this proposal, and at their meeting on 8 July 1940, he offered advice on how it should be presented. It was endorsed at a Cabinet meeting on 11 July, and an official acceptance was conveyed to Lord Lothian, the British Ambassador to the United States, on 29 July.

Among the wealth of information that the Tizard Mission, a scientific mission sent to the United States to promote the exchange of military science and technology, brought to America were details about the MAUD Committee&#x27;s deliberations and activities. Some information from the MAUD Committee had already been conveyed to the United States by Ralph H. Fowler, the British scientific attaché to Canada. Cockcroft, a member of the Tizard Mission, brought more. Cockcroft and Fowler met with the Uranium Committee, but the information flow was largely one-way. Cockcroft reported that the American atomic bomb project lagged behind the British, and was not proceeding as fast. Work conducted in America included research by Szilard and Enrico Fermi at Columbia University into the possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction; preliminary investigations into isotope separation using centrifugation, gaseous diffusion and thermal diffusion processes; and efforts to produce plutonium in the cyclotron at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California.

Kenneth Bainbridge from Harvard University attended a MAUD Committee meeting on 9 April 1941, and was surprised to discover that the British were convinced that an atomic bomb was technically feasible. The Uranium Committee met at Harvard on 5 May, and Bainbridge presented his report. Bush engaged a group headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel laureate in physics and chairman of the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago, to investigate further. Compton&#x27;s report, issued on 17 May 1941, did not address the design or manufacture of a bomb in detail. Instead it endorsed a post-war project concentrating on atomic energy for power production. On 28 June 1941, Roosevelt created the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), with Bush as its director, personally responsible to the president. The new organisation subsumed the NDRC, now chaired by James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University. The Uranium Committee became the Uranium Section of the OSRD, but was soon renamed the S-1 Section for security reasons.

Britain was at war, but the US was not. Oliphant flew to the United States in late August 1941, ostensibly to discuss the radar programme, but actually to find out why the United States was ignoring the MAUD Committee&#x27;s findings. He discovered to his dismay that the reports and other documents sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with all members of the committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with William D. Coolidge, who was acting in Compton&#x27;s place while the latter was in South America; Samuel K. Allison, a colleague of Compton&#x27;s at the University of Chicago; Ernest O. Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory; Fermi and Conant to explain the urgency. In these meetings he spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty. Allison recalled that when Oliphant met with the S-1 Section, he &quot;came to a meeting, and said &#x27;bomb&#x27; in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb and said we had no right to work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost $25 million, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us.&quot;

Bush and Conant received the final MAUD Report from Thomson on 3 October 1941. With this in hand, Bush met with Roosevelt and Vice-President Henry A. Wallace at the White House on 9 October 1941, and obtained a commitment to an expanded and expedited American atomic bomb project. Two days later, Roosevelt sent a letter to Churchill in which he proposed that they exchange views &quot;in order that any extended efforts may be coordinated or even jointly conducted.&quot;

== Collaboration ==
Roosevelt regarded this offer of a joint project as sufficiently important to have the letter personally delivered by Frederick L. Hovde, the head of the NDRC mission in London, but Churchill did not respond until December. He assured Roosevelt of his willingness to collaborate, and informed him that Hovde had discussed the matter with Sir John Anderson and Lord Cherwell, as Frederick Lindemann was now known. The MAUD Committee had considered the issue of collaboration with the United States, and had concluded that while pilot isotope separation plants could be established in the United Kingdom, full-scale production facilities would have to be built in the United States. The British expressed concerns about the security of the American project. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies. John Cairncross had given the Soviet Union a copy of the MAUD Committee report. Although not conveyed to the Americans, the British had other concerns about what might happen after the war if the Americans embraced isolationism, as had occurred after the First World War, and Britain had to fight the Soviet Union alone. The opportunity for a joint project was therefore missed. British and American exchange of information continued but their programmes remained separate.
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 led to the United States&#x27; entry into the war. Funding now became available in amounts undreamt of the year before. OSRD contracts were due to expire at the end of June 1942, and there was intense wartime competition for raw materials. It was agreed that in 1942–1943, the United States Army would fund $53 million of an $85 million programme. On 18 June 1942, Colonel James C. Marshall was ordered to organise the Army component. He established his headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York City, with the innocuous name of the Manhattan Engineer District, following the usual practice of naming engineer districts after the city in which its headquarters was located. The project soon adopted the name &quot;Manhattan&quot; as well. By September 1942, Bush and Conant felt that the time had come for the Army to take over, something already approved by the president on 17 June 1942, and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. became the director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. Groves attempted to tighten security through a policy of strict compartmentalisation similar to the one that the British had imposed on radar.

The American effort soon overtook the British. British scientists who visited the United States in 1942 were astounded at the progress and momentum the Manhattan Project had assumed. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised Churchill that: &quot;We must face the fact that ... [our] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a &#x27;merger&#x27;. Soon we shall have little or none&quot;. But Bush and Conant had already decided that British help was no longer needed. In October 1942, they convinced Roosevelt that the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb, despite the agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.

The positions of the two countries were the reverse of what they had been in 1941. American officials were concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. The Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, felt that since the United States was doing &quot;ninety percent of the work&quot; on the bomb, it would be &quot;better for us to go along for the present without sharing anything more than we could help&quot;. In December 1942, Roosevelt agreed to restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war, even if doing so impeded the American project. The Americans stopped sharing any information on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of atomic bomb design, or the facts about fast neutron reactions. This adversely impacted the work of the Montreal Laboratory, the joint British and Canadian project that was investigating nuclear reactor design. In retaliation, the British stopped sending scientists to America, slowing the pace of work there, which had relied on British scientists. The Americans then ceased all information sharing.
The Tube Alloys Directorate considered whether Britain could produce a bomb without American help. A gaseous diffusion plant to produce 1 kg of weapons-grade uranium per day was estimated to cost up to £3 million in research and development, and anything up to £50 million to build in wartime Britain. A nuclear reactor to produce 1 kg of plutonium per day would have to be built in Canada. It would take up to five years to build and cost £5 million. The project would also require facilities for producing the required heavy water for the reactor costing between £5 million and £10 million, and for producing uranium metal, which would cost another £1.5 million. The project would need overwhelming priority, as it was estimated to require 20,000 workers, many of them highly skilled, 500,000 tons of steel, and 500,000 kW of electricity. Disruption to other wartime projects would be inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. The unanimous response was that before embarking on this, another effort should be made to obtain American co-operation.

By March 1943 Bush and Conant had decided that British help would benefit some areas of the Manhattan Project. In particular, it could benefit enough from assistance from Chadwick and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and the construction company Kellogg wanted British comments on the design of the gaseous diffusion plant it was building.

== Negotiations ==
Churchill took up the matter with Roosevelt when they met at the Washington Conference on 25 May 1943. A meeting was arranged that afternoon between Cherwell and Bush in Hopkins&#x27;s office in the White House, with Hopkins looking on. Both stated their respective positions, and Cherwell explained that Britain&#x27;s post-war interest was in nuclear weapons, and not commercial opportunities. Hopkins reported back to Roosevelt, and Churchill and Roosevelt agreed that information interchange should be reviewed, and that the atomic bomb project should be a joint one. Hopkins sent Churchill a telegram confirming this on 17 June, but American policy did not change, largely because Roosevelt did not inform Bush when they next met on 24 June. When Churchill pressed for action in a telegram on 9 July, Hopkins counselled Roosevelt that &quot;you made a firm commitment to Churchill in regard to this when he was here and there is nothing to do but go through with it.&quot;
Bush was in London on 15 July 1943 to attend a meeting of the British War Cabinet&#x27;s Anti-U-boat Committee. Sir Stafford Cripps took him to see Churchill who told Bush that the President had given him his word of honour on full co-operation, and that he was incensed at obstruction by American bureaucrats. Bush suggested that he take up the matter with Stimson, who was also in London. Churchill did so on 17 July, and Stimson promised to submit the matter to Roosevelt. On 20 July, Roosevelt wrote to Bush with instructions to &quot;renew, in an inclusive manner, the full exchange with the British Government regarding Tube Alloys&quot;, but since Bush was in London, he did not see this letter for another ten days. Stimson, Bush and Stimson&#x27;s special assistant, Harvey Bundy, met Churchill, Cherwell and Anderson at 10 Downing Street in London on 22 July. None of them was aware that Roosevelt had already made his decision.

Stimson had just finished a series of arguments with the British about the need for an invasion of France. He was reluctant to appear to disagree with them about everything, and, unlike Bush, was sensitive to insinuations that Britain was being unfairly treated. He spoke in conciliatory terms about the need for good post-war relations between the two countries. For his part, Churchill disavowed interest in the commercial applications of nuclear technology. The reason for British concern about the post-war co-operation, they explained, was not commercial concerns, but so that Britain would have nuclear weapons after the war. Bush then proposed a five-point plan, which Stimson promised to put before the president for approval.

Anderson drafted an agreement for full interchange, which Churchill re-worded &quot;in more majestic language&quot;. Anderson feared that Groves might tell Stimson and Bush that &quot;like all Americans who come to our misty island, they have been taken in by our hypocritical cunning and carried away by our brilliant Prime Minister&quot;. When Conant found out about the agreement, he expressed the opinion that he would feel more at home on the staff of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, a newspaper renowned for its anti-British views. Anderson arrived in Washington with the draft on 5 August, and went over it with Conant and Bush. From the American point of view, nothing made it into the final draft that contradicted the existing policy on interchange of information. Anderson extracted one important concession: the creation of the Combined Policy Committee to oversee the joint project with representation from the United States, Britain and Canada. Conant&#x27;s objections to Anderson&#x27;s proposed arrangements for information interchange were met by assigning the task to the Combined Policy Committee. Stimson, General George Marshall and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell reviewed the document and made minor changes, and it was then sent to the British Embassy for approval.

== Agreement ==

A speedy drafting process was required because Roosevelt, Churchill and their political and military advisors converged for the Quadrant Conference at the Citadelle of Quebec on 17 August, hosted by the Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King. Most of the discussions were about the invasion of France. Although the Quebec Agreement was a bilateral one to which Canada was not a signatory, the British felt that Canada&#x27;s contribution to Tube Alloys was significant enough that high-level representation was appropriate. King was therefore asked to nominate a Canadian member of the Combined Policy Committee, and he selected C. D. Howe, the Canadian Minister of Munitions and Supply. Stimson, Bush and Conant would be the American members, while Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin would be the British members.

On 19 August Roosevelt and Churchill signed the Quebec Agreement, which was typed on four pages of Citadelle notepaper, and formally titled &quot;Articles of Agreement governing collaboration between the authorities of the USA and UK in the matter of Tube Alloys&quot;. The United Kingdom and the United States agreed that &quot;it is vital to our common safety in the present War to bring the Tube Alloys project to fruition at the earliest moment&quot;, and that this was best accomplished by pooling their resources. The Quebec Agreement stipulated that:
# The US and UK would pool their resources to develop nuclear weapons with a free exchange of information;
# Neither country would use them against the other;
# Neither country would use them against other countries without consent;
# Neither country would pass information about them to other countries without consent;
# That &quot;in view of the heavy burden of production falling, upon the United States&quot;, the President might limit post-war British commercial or industrial uses of atomic energy.

The only part of the Quebec Agreement that troubled Stimson was the requirement for mutual consent before atomic bombs could be used. Had Congress known about it, they would never have supported it. The American veto over post-war British commercial and industrial uses made it clear that Britain was the junior partner in the Grand Alliance. Churchill in particular considered the Quebec Agreement to be the best deal he could have struck under the circumstances, and the restrictions were the price he had to pay to obtain the technical information needed for a successful post-war nuclear weapons project. Margaret Gowing noted that the &quot;idea of the independent deterrent was already well entrenched.&quot;

The Quebec Agreement was a secret agreement. Its terms were known to but a few insiders, and its very existence was not revealed to the United States Congress. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was given an oral summary on 12 May 1947. On 12 February 1951, Churchill wrote to President Harry S. Truman for permission to publish it, but Truman declined. Churchill therefore omitted it from his memoir, &quot;Closing the Ring&quot; (1951). It remained a secret until Churchill read it out in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954. However, on 4 September 1943 the Soviet atomic spy Ursula Kuczynski (&quot;Sonia&quot;) reported details of the agreement to the GRU in Moscow, which she had probably obtained from Fuchs.

== Implementation ==
Even before the Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with instructions that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Simon should leave immediately for North America. They arrived on 19 August, the day it was signed, expecting to be able to talk to American scientists, but were unable to do so. Two weeks passed before American officials learned of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Bush told Akers that his action was premature, and that the Combined Policy Committee would first have to agree on the rules governing the employment of British scientists. With nothing to do, the scientists returned to the UK. Groves briefed the OSRD S-1 Executive Committee, which had replaced the S-1 Committee on 19 June 1942, at a special meeting on 10 September 1943. The text of the Quebec Agreement was vague in places, with loopholes that Groves could exploit to enforce compartmentalisation. Negotiations on the terms of technical interchange dragged on until December 1943. The new procedures went into effect on 14 December with the approval of the Military Policy Committee (which governed the Manhattan Project) and the Combined Policy Committee. By this time British scientists had already commenced working in the United States.
Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times. The first occasion was on the afternoon of 8 September 1943; Stimson discovered that he was the chairman only that morning. This first meeting established a Technical Subcommittee chaired by American Major General Wilhelm D. Styer. The Americans did not want Akers on the Technical Subcommittee due to his ICI background, so Llewellin nominated Chadwick, whom he also wanted to be Head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The other members of the Technical Committee were Richard C. Tolman, who was Groves&#x27;s scientific advisor, and C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the Canadian National Research Council. It was agreed that the Technical Committee could act without consulting the Combined Policy Committee whenever its decision was unanimous. It held its first meeting at The Pentagon on 10 September 1943.

There remained the issue of co-operation between the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Montreal Laboratory. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944, Chadwick pressed for resources to build a nuclear reactor at what is now known as the Chalk River Laboratories. Britain and Canada agreed to pay the cost of this project, but the United States had to supply the heavy water. Because it was unlikely to have any impact on the war, Conant in particular was cool about the proposal, but heavy water reactors were still of great interest. Groves was willing to support the effort and supply the heavy water required, but with certain restrictions. The Montreal Laboratory would have access to data from the Metallurgical Laboratory&#x27;s research reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site; nor would they be given any information about the chemistry of plutonium, or of methods for separating it from other elements. This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944.

Chadwick supported the British contribution to the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill&#x27;s backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured. While the pace of research eased as the war entered its final phase, scientists were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise them away from the wartime projects in which they were invariably engaged. A British Mission led by Akers assisted in the development of gaseous diffusion technology in New York. Another, led by Oliphant, who acted as deputy director at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, assisted with the electromagnetic separation process. As head of the British Mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory, Chadwick, and later Peierls, led a multinational team of distinguished scientists that included Sir Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, William Penney, Frisch, and Fuchs. Four members of the British Mission became group leaders at Los Alamos. Penney observed the bombing of Nagasaki on 9 August 1945 and participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946.

A major strain on the Agreement came up in 1944, when it was revealed to the United States that the United Kingdom had made a secret agreement with Hans von Halban to share nuclear information with France after the war in exchange for free use of patents related to nuclear reactors filed by French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie and his Collège de France team. Upon this revelation, the United States and Canada objected, stating that the Halban agreement violated the terms of the Quebec Agreement, namely the section about third-party information-sharing without prior mutual consent. The United Kingdom broke its obligations to France in order to satisfy the United States. Anderson was extremely concerned about alienating the French, and he and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Anthony Eden, suggested that the French be offered an undertaking that France would subsequently be included in the Manhattan Project, but Churchill did not agree, and remained adamantly opposed to any disclosures to France or the Soviet Union. After the war, the French government repudiated the Halban agreement.

The issue of patent rights was a complex one, and attempts to negotiate deals between Britain and the United States in 1942, and between Britain and Canada in 1943, had failed. After the Quebec Agreement was signed, British and American experts sat down together again and hammered out an agreement, which was endorsed by the Combined Policy Committee in September 1944. This agreement, which also covered Canada, was retrospective to the signing of the Quebec Agreement in August 1943, but owing to necessary secrecy, was not finalised until 1956, and covered all patents held in November 1955. Each of the three countries agreed to transfer to the others any rights it held in the others&#x27; countries, and waive any claims for compensation against them.

Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, the deputy head of the British Mission to the United States, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Dill died in Washington on 4 November 1944, and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. It was therefore Wilson who, on 4 July 1945, under the clause of the Quebec Agreement that specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent, agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.

== Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire ==

In September 1944, a second wartime conference was held in Quebec known as the Octagon Conference. In the wake of a string of Allied victories, thoughts turned to post-war planning. Afterwards, Roosevelt and Churchill spent some time together at Roosevelt&#x27;s Springwood estate in Hyde Park, New York. They discussed post-war collaboration on nuclear weapons, and on 19 September signed the Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire, detailing the agreement resulting from what they discussed. Most of this dealt with Bohr&#x27;s thoughts on international control, but it also provided that &quot;[f]ull collaboration between the United States and the British Government in developing Tube Alloys for military and commercial purposes should continue after the defeat of Japan unless and until terminated by joint agreement.&quot;

Of Roosevelt&#x27;s advisors, only Hopkins and Admiral William D. Leahy knew of this secret wartime agreement, and Leahy, possibly because he never believed that the atomic bomb would work, and was therefore perhaps not paying much attention, had only a muddled recollection of what had been said. When Wilson raised the Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July. Even then, Groves questioned the document&#x27;s authenticity until the American copy was located many years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt&#x27;s naval aide, apparently misfiled in Roosevelt&#x27;s Hyde Park papers by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, and who thought it had something to do with naval guns or boiler tubes.

== End of the Quebec Agreement ==
Truman, who had succeeded Roosevelt on the latter&#x27;s death on 12 April 1945, Clement Attlee, who had replaced Churchill as prime minister in July 1945, Anderson and United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes conferred while on a boat cruise on the Potomac River, and agreed to revise the Quebec Agreement, with a view to replacing it with a looser form of co-operation on nuclear matters between the three governments. Groves, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Patterson&#x27;s advisor George L. Harrison met with a British delegation consisting of Anderson, Wilson, Malcolm MacDonald, the High Commissioner to Canada, Roger Makins from the British Embassy in Washington, and Denis Rickett, Anderson&#x27;s assistant, on 15 November 1945 to draw up a communiqué. They agreed to retain the Combined Policy Committee. The Quebec Agreement&#x27;s requirement for &quot;mutual consent&quot; before using nuclear weapons was replaced with one for &quot;prior consultation&quot;, and there was to be &quot;full and effective cooperation in the field of atomic energy&quot;, but in the longer Memorandum of Intention, signed by Groves and Anderson, this was only &quot;in the field of basic scientific research&quot;. Patterson took the communiqué to the White House, where Truman and Attlee signed it on 16 November 1945. A draft agreement was approved by the Combined Policy Committee on 4 December 1945 as the basis for the revocation of the Quebec Agreement.
The next meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 produced no accord on collaboration, and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee. Truman cabled on 20 April that he did not see the communiqué he had signed as obligating the United States to assist Britain in designing, constructing and operating an atomic energy plant. Attlee&#x27;s response on 6 June 1946 &quot;did not mince words nor conceal his displeasure behind the nuances of diplomatic language.&quot; At issue was not just technical co-operation, which was fast disappearing, but the allocation of uranium ore. During the war this was of little concern, as Britain had not needed any ore, so all the production of the Congo mines and all the ore seized by the Alsos Mission had gone to the United States, but now it was also required by the British atomic project. Chadwick and Groves reached an agreement by which ore would be shared equally.

The defection of Igor Gouzenko and the resulting espionage conviction of Alan Nunn May, a British physicist who had worked at the Montreal Laboratory, made it politically impossible for US officials to exchange information with the UK. Congress, unaware of the Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire because of the loss of the American copy, enacted the McMahon Act. Signed by Truman on 1 August 1946, and in effect from midnight on 1 January 1947, this law ended technical co-operation. Its control of &quot;restricted data&quot; prevented the United States&#x27; allies from receiving any information. The remaining scientists were denied access to papers that they had written just days before. The McMahon Act fuelled resentment from British scientists and officials alike, and led directly to the British decision in January 1947 to develop its own nuclear weapons. In the United States, there was a furore over the British veto over the use of nuclear weapons when the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was informed of the Quebec Agreement (but not the November 1945 agreement) on 12 May 1947, resulting in intense pressure on Truman to drop the provision. On 7 January 1948, Bush, James Fisk, Cockcroft and Mackenzie concluded an agreement known as the &quot;modus vivendi&quot;, that allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada, which officially repealed the Quebec Agreement. Like the Quebec Agreement it replaced, the &quot;modus vivendi&quot; was classified &quot;Top Secret&quot;.

As the Cold War set in, enthusiasm in the United States for an alliance with Britain cooled as well. A September 1949 poll found that 72 per cent of Americans agreed that the United States should not &quot;share our atomic energy secrets with England&quot;. The reputation of the British was further tarnished by the 1950 revelation that Fuchs was a Soviet atomic spy. British wartime participation in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial to the success of High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom&#x27;s post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the McMahon Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.

<doc id="1300546" wikidata="Q322457" url="?curid=1300546" title="Subrogation">
<text>Subrogation is the assumption by a third party (such as a second creditor or an insurance company) of another party&#x27;s legal right to collect debts or damages. It is a legal doctrine whereby one person is entitled to enforce the subsisting or revived rights of another for their own benefit. A right of subrogation typically arises by operation of law, but can also arise by statute or by agreement. Subrogation is an equitable remedy, having first developed in the English Court of Chancery. It is a familiar feature of common law systems. Analogous doctrines exist in civil law jurisdictions.

Subrogation is a relatively specialised legal field; entire legal textbooks are devoted to the subject.

== Doctrine ==
Countries which have inherited the common law system will typically have a doctrine of subrogation, but its doctrinal basis in a particular jurisdiction may vary from that in other jurisdictions, depending upon the extent to which equity remains a distinct body of law in that jurisdiction.

English courts have now accepted that the concept of unjust enrichment has a role to play in subrogation. In contrast, this approach has been stridently rejected by the High Court of Australia, where the doctrinal basis of subrogation is said to lie in the prevention of unconscionable results: for example, the discharge of a debtor or one party obtaining double recovery.

==Types ==
The situations in which subrogation will be available are not closed and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Subrogation typically arises in three-party situations. Some common examples of subrogation include:
* &quot;Indemnity insurance.&quot; An indemnity insurer may be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of insured as against a third party who is responsible for the damage to the insured.
* &quot;Law of guarantees&quot;. A surety may be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor as against the principal debtor.
* &quot;Trust creditors.&quot; A creditor of a trustee may be entitled to be subrogated to the trustee&#x27;s right of indemnity.

===Indemnity insurer&#x27;s subrogation rights===
&quot;Subrogation&quot; has been used in this context to refer to two distinct situations.

First, after paying out under a policy of indemnity insurance, an insurer may be entitled to stand in the shoes of the insured and enforce the insured&#x27;s rights against the third party tortfeasor who is responsible for the loss. This is subrogation in its proper or core sense. Insurance subrogation, and, specifically, the types and amounts of payments that can be recovered, differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Secondly, after paying out under a policy of indemnity insurance, an insurer may be entitled to sue the insured where the insured has already had his loss made good by the third party tortfeasor. That is, the insurer has a claim against the insured so as to ensure that the insured does not get double recovery. This situation might arise if, for example, an insured claimed in full under the policy, but then started proceedings against the third party tortfeasor, and recovered substantial damages. Strictly speaking, this is not a case of subrogation; it is a case of recoupment.

===Travel insurance subrogation process===
In an &quot;excess&quot; or &quot;supplemental&quot; travel insurance policy where there is a &#x27;first payer&#x27; clause, through the subrogation process an insurer is legally entitled to seek cost-sharing up to a certain percentage from a member&#x27;s private group health insurance provider after the insurer pays out a travel insurance claim. These plans are less expensive but if there is a major claim made, Insurance carriers, such as RBC insurance, can offer 

While these supplemental travel insurance policies may be less expensive in the short run, they can have devastating consequences if a serious and costly health crisis occurs while travelling. That means that if a client makes a claim, the insurer will recover that amount from the member&#x27;s private group health insurance provider such as $100,000 of the $200,000 total. That can become problematic if the member later has a serious illness because many private group health insurance providers have a lifetime maximum coverage amount, such as $500,000, for its extended health plans. If the member purchases travel insurance from their own extended health-care provider, a claim would not have affected the lifetime maximum.

===Surety&#x27;s subrogation rights===
A surety who pays off the debts of another party may be entitled to be subrogated to the creditor&#x27;s former claims and remedies against the debtor to recover the sum paid. That would include the endorser on a bill of exchange. The surety will then have the benefit of any security interest in favour of the creditor for the original debt. Conceptually this is an important point, as the subrogee will take the subrogor&#x27;s security rights by operation of law, even if the subrogee had been unaware of them.

===Subrogation rights against trustees===
A trustee of who enters into transactions for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust is generally entitled to be indemnified out of the trust assets; this is secured by way of an equitable lien or first charge over the trust assets. This is a proprietary security interest.

Trust creditors (that is, persons who have become creditors of the trustee &quot;qua&quot; trustee) may be entitled to be subrogated to the trustee&#x27;s lien. This is a particularly precarious &#x27;right&#x27; of trust creditors: a trustee may not have a right of indemnity (for example, because the trustee has committed a breach of trust in incurring the liability to the creditor in question) or it may be limited (for example, where the trustee has committed an unrelated breach of trust and the clear accounts rule operates). In some jurisdictions it is possible for the trustee&#x27;s right of indemnity to be excluded altogether. In these cases, subrogation may be rendered worthless or impossible.

===Lender&#x27;s subrogation rights===
Where a lender lends money to a borrower to discharge the borrower&#x27;s debt to a third party (or which the lender pays directly to the third party to discharge the debt), the lender may be entitled to be subrogated to the third party&#x27;s former rights against the borrower to the extent of the debt discharged.

===Miscellaneous ===
Where a bank, acting on what it believes erroneously to be the valid mandate of its client, pays money to a third party which discharges the customer&#x27;s liability to the third party, the bank is subrogated to the third party&#x27;s former remedies against the customer.

==Effects==
If subrogation is available, the subrogated party is entitled to stand in the shoes of another and enforce that other party&#x27;s rights. If the equity is established, the court may effect the subrogation remedy by way of equitable lien, charge, or a constructive trust with a liability to account. Crucially, the claimant&#x27;s rights are wholly derivative, hence the claimant has no higher rights than the person to whom he or she is subrogated.

==Waiver of subrogation==
In practice insurers may agree to a waiver of their subrogation rights.

== Subrogation in case law==
In the United States, in &quot;River Junction v Maryland Casualty Co.&quot; (1943), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the assignee (the bank), should properly be subrogated to the rights of the owner, and not the surety.

== Subrogation in civil law jurisdictions ==
Analogous doctrines exist in civil law countries; for example, Articles 1651-1659 of the &quot;Civil Code of Quebec&quot; deal with subrogation under Quebec&#x27;s civil law:

<text>The University of Chittagong() also known as Chittagong University, abbreviated as CU, is a public research university located in Chittagong, Bangladesh. It was established on 18 November 1966. It is one of the oldest universities in Bangladesh. Its campus is the largest among universities in Bangladesh. It is one of the four autonomous universities of Bangladesh.

== Facilities ==

===Library===

Chittagong University&#x27;s collection of about 350,000 books, and over 40,000 bound journals is housed in a library built in 1990.

===Chittagong University Museum===

Chittagong University Museum was established in 1973 with artifacts from the History Department, including fossils found amongst the Nasirabad hills. It has subsequently accumulated an extensive collection of historical artifacts and paintings. In 2016, The Daily Star donated a Chittagong history archive to the museum.

===University shuttle train===

The university shuttle train is operated by Bangladesh Railway eastern division and monitored by university authority. Trains leave Chattogram railway station and Sholoshohor railway station, and city-bound trains leave Chattogram University railway station.

====Shuttle graffiti====
Chittagong University shuttle trains have a long history of graffiti art. There were allegations it was being used by rival political groups to assert influence over train compartments. After April 2011 clashes between five compartment-based gangs left at least eight students injured, the university expelled 11 students and banned all types of compartment-based organisational activities, including sticking posters, leaflets and graffiti on the trains.
Eleven years after that incident, German artist Lukas Zeilinger, accompanied by Livia, his wife, and Arup Barua, a teacher at the Department of Dramatics of the university, painted the carriages once again. The project was self-funded by the Zeiligers as part of their art project.

<text>Berkeley College is a residential college at Yale University, opened in 1934. The eighth of Yale&#x27;s 14 residential colleges, it was named in honor of Bishop George Berkeley (1685–1753), dean of Derry and later bishop of Cloyne, in recognition of the assistance in land and books that he gave to Yale in the 18th century. Built on the site of a group of buildings known from the 1890s until 1933 as the Berkeley Oval, the college was renovated in 1998. It is distinct for having two courtyards connected by an underground tunnel.

==College life==


*Berkeley freshmen are housed in Lanman-Wright Hall, renovated in 2014.
*Dining Hall: The dining hall is named in honor of Joseph Fogg. 
*Buttery: Currently known as olo-Marvin’s. Known in the 1980s and 1990s as the &quot;Bagel Bar.&quot;
*Library: Also known as &quot;Laz,&quot; study space named in honor of George Lazarus and Shelly Lazarus. 
*South Court Basement.
*Multipurpose Room: A half-court space to play basketball, it is also frequently used for practicing yoga or student orchestra rehearsals. It can be reserved through the Head&#x27;s Office.
* North Court Basement: Home to The Thomas Mendenhall Common Room and the Samuel Hemingway Music Room.
* The Swiss Room: A private dining room in the dining hall. Transplanted piece by piece from Switzerland, this 16th-century wooden room has been decorated with stained glass by G. Owen Bonawit and is considered priceless. Access is restricted to fellows and Berkeley events.
* The tunnel: An underground passageway connecting Berkeley&#x27;s two grand courts, North Court and South Court, which are divided by a grassy area in front of Yale&#x27;s main library, Sterling Memorial Library. It stands steps away from the Beinecke Library, the Bass Library, the Commons, and the Old Campus. The tunnel features a variety of student murals on the walls.
*On the wall outside the Head&#x27;s House that faces Sterling Memorial Library, there is a plaque stating that its location marks the house where Josiah Willard Gibbs lived.
* The Head&#x27;s House was named as the Swensen House in 2013 to honor Berkeley Fellow David Swensen&#x27;s enormous contributions to Yale as the Chief Investment Officer.
* Similar to other residential colleges, Berkeley has its own gym, seminar rooms, and other amenities.

==Traditions==
Annual traditions include the Berkeley Birthday Dinner for fellows and seniors, Thunder Brunch, Lunar New Year&#x27;s Feast, a snowball fight (which pits North Court against South Court), GLO (a blacklight party), and the Bishop Bash, which was founded in the spring of 2002 by Ben Reiter and Charles Finch under the guidance of the Head&#x27;s Office.

==Dining hall==
According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Berkeley had the best college dining hall in the country. Until 2006 it was the testing ground for an experimental organic food and sustainable produce dining plan overseen by celebrity chef Alice Waters. Currently, the dining hall has joined the rest of the residential colleges in serving the same menu, thereby rescinding its unique status. It still remains an immensely popular place to eat, largely due to its central location on campus.

<doc id="1300568" wikidata="Q1095354" url="?curid=1300568" title="Clarence 13X">
<text>Clarence 13X, also known as Allah the Father (born Clarence Edward Smith) (February 22, 1928 – June 13, 1969), was an American religious leader and the founder of the Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Nation of Gods and Earths (NGE/NOGE)&quot;. He was born in Virginia and moved to New York City as a young man, before serving in the United States Army during the Korean War. After returning to New York, he learned that his wife had joined the Nation of Islam (NOI). He followed her, taking the name Clarence 13X. He served in the group as a security officer, martial arts instructor, and student minister before leaving for an unclear reason in 1963. He enjoyed gambling, which was condemned by the NOI, and disagreed with their teachings that Wallace Fard Muhammad was a divine messenger.

After leaving the NOI, Clarence 13X formed a new group with other former members. He concluded that all black men were divine and took the name Allah to symbolize this status. He rejected the belief in an invisible God, teaching that God could be found within each black man. In his view, women were &quot;earths&quot; that complemented and nurtured men. He believed that they should be submissive to men. He and a few assistants retained some NOI teachings and pioneered novel interpretations of them. They ascribed teachings to the meaning of letters and numerals: understanding the meaning of each letter and number was said to provide deep truths about God and the universe. Clarence 13X referred to his new movement as the &quot;Five Percenters&quot;, referencing a NOI teaching that only five percent of the population knew and promoted the truth about God. One way that he distinguished his group from his previous faith, was by rejecting dress codes or strict behavioral guidelines—he allowed the consumption of alcohol, and at times, the use of illegal drugs.

In 1964, Clarence 13X was shot by an unknown assailant, but survived the attack. After an incident several months later, in which he and several of his followers vandalized stores and fought with police, he was arrested and placed in psychiatric care. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He referred to himself as &quot;Allah&quot;, which had become his preferred name. He was released from custody after a 1966 ruling by the Supreme Court placed limits on confinement without trial. Although he initially taught his followers to hate white people, he eventually began to cooperate with white city leaders. They gave him funding for a night school, and in return, he tried to prevent violence in Harlem. In June 1969, Clarence 13X was fatally shot. The identity of his killer is unknown. The mayor of New York City and several other prominent leaders expressed condolences to his followers. Although the Five Percenters faltered in the immediate aftermath of his death, the movement rebounded after new leadership emerged. The group took a non-hierarchical approach to leadership, and no single leader replaced Clarence 13X. He has been held in high regard by Five Percenters, who celebrate his birthday as a holiday.

==Early life and Nation of Islam==
Clarence Edward Smith was born on February 22, 1928, and raised in Danville, Virginia, with his five brothers and one sister. During his childhood, Virginia was racially segregated, and he witnessed incidents of racism, including a fight between his father and a white man that was sparked by racial tensions. In 1946, he moved with his mother to New York City, where they settled in Harlem. He attended only two years of high school.

In 1949, Smith fathered a child, Clarence Jowers, with Willieen Jowers. He married a woman named Dora Smith in 1950. He fathered another child, Otis Jowers, with Willieen in 1951. He also had several sons and daughters with Dora. Smith joined the U.S. Army in the early 1950s and was stationed in Korea from 1952 to 1954, where he served as an infantryman in the Korean War. After returning to the U.S., he lived in Harlem and served in the United States Army Reserve until 1960. During his military service, he became skilled in karate.
Dora Smith embraced the Nation of Islam (NOI) while her husband was away and he converted after returning to New York. By 1961, he had registered at Mosque No. 7 and changed his name to Clarence 13X in accordance with NOI practice. Before his conversion, he often smoked marijuana and gambled, activities forbidden by the NOI. After joining the group, he studied the NOI&#x27;s doctrines and quickly progressed within their organizational structure, possibly thanks to skills learned in the military. His responsibilities included teaching martial arts and serving on the Fruit of Islam security team. He was recognized as a skilled speaker and reached the rank of &quot;student minister&quot; at Mosque No. 7. By 1963, he had come to the attention of the FBI—informants recorded his presence at rallies led by Malcolm X.

The early 1960s were a turbulent period for the NOI. Unrest was caused by conflicts between leaders Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X. Around that time, Clarence 13X became disenchanted with the organization, although the root of his qualms is not known. NOI members have offered contradictory accounts of the events that caused his exit and whether he left voluntarily. His departure has been variously attributed to doubts about the NOI&#x27;s theology, violations of their moral code, objections to the luxurious lifestyles of their senior leadership, or Malcolm X&#x27;s distrust of him. Dora Smith elected to stay with the group, prompting the couple&#x27;s separation. 

Before leaving the NOI, Clarence 13X had begun to doubt their teaching that Wallace Fard Muhammad was a divine messenger. He believed that the NOI&#x27;s teachings were contradictory because they taught that God is black, but encouraged reverence of Fard Muhammad, who was not of exclusively African descent. Clarence 13X concluded that divinity was found in all black men, rather than in a single person. Several times before he left the NOI, he was censured by the leadership for these assertions. His friend John 37X elected to leave with him. Malcolm X left the NOI in 1963 and remained on good terms with Clarence 13X. Clarence 13X did not join Malcolm X&#x27;s newly created group, Muslim Mosque, Inc.

==Founding the Five Percenters==
After leaving the NOI, Clarence 13X and John 37X continued to study the group&#x27;s teachings, sometimes while smoking marijuana. They assumed new names: 13X took Allah, and 37X, Abu Shahid. After reading an NOI book with 34 riddles, known as the &quot;Lost-Found Lessons&quot;, 37X concluded that numbers represented specific concepts, such as knowledge or wisdom. He referred to this system as &quot;living mathematics&quot;. During its development, he was imprisoned on firearms charges. 

While 37X was in prison, 13X taught a system of beliefs he referred to as &quot;supreme wisdom&quot;, which he saw as the core of Islam, to groups of young men. He was assisted by his friend James Howard, with whom he developed a modified version of living mathematics, &quot;supreme mathematics&quot;, and an accompanying doctrine about letters, the &quot;supreme alphabet&quot;. The development of these systems, considered a &quot;divine science&quot; by adherents, may have been influenced by the teachings of Sufism. Like some schools of Sufism, they found esoteric meanings in the alphabet. David Smydra of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; compares these teachings to Kabbalah. Felicia Miyakawa of Middle Tennessee State University sees similarities to Gnosticism and Kemetism.

Clarence 13X ascribed novel teachings, assigning backronyms to familiar words. He stated that the letters of the word &quot;Allah&quot; stood for &quot;arm, leg, leg, arm, head&quot;, signifying the human body. This was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature. He named parts of the New York area after locations in the Middle East that are significant to Islam: Harlem was referred to as Mecca, and Brooklyn as Medina. Other disaffected NOI members, including some who served the Fruit of Islam, were soon drawn to his burgeoning group. Several people from the NOI who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X also joined. Clarence 13X incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders. 

In the group&#x27;s early years, some Five Percenters attended NOI events. Clarence 13X&#x27;s theology had much in common with the teachings of the NOI, although there were notable differences. He taught his followers that he was an incarnation of God, and they each were gods. His followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for God. Clarence 13X taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of African descent not found in Europeans and their descendants, echoing statements made by Elijah Muhammad. 

Clarence did not enforce the NOI&#x27;s strict moral rules: One way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the NOI, including gambling, alcohol consumption, and drug use. Clarence 13X told his followers to avoid developing addictions, but that drug use was not inherently wrong. He strictly forbade the consumption of pork, arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the United States, such as rats and dogs, and hence should not be consumed. Owing to their belief that black men are gods, the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet.

Early members of the group often proselytized on street corners for hours. Clarence 13X&#x27;s assistants led classes about the group&#x27;s teachings, strictly enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings about the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did so, they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.

Clarence 13X&#x27;s group was initially known as the &quot;Suns of Almighty God Allah&quot; or the &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. After Malcolm X&#x27;s death, the group became known as the &quot;Five Percenters&quot; or the &quot;Five Percent Nation&quot;. The name was drawn from the NOI&#x27;s claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about God. Clarence 13X considered his movement to be the five percent of the NOI that still held to truth and integrity. The other 95 percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt. 

Clarence 13X assembled an inner circle of assistants, nine of whom are referred to by Five Percenters as the &quot;First Born&quot;: they are said to embody his attributes. The assistants were assigned to spread the group&#x27;s teachings to younger people, many of whom took African names, including some from non-Islamic societies. Clarence 13X taught Afrocentrism to his disciples and often wore a dashiki. Male Five Percenters members frequently wore tasseled kufis, and female members wore colorful African head wraps. Some Five Percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft. Others intentionally committed minor legal infractions, hoping to proselytize to others who had been arrested.

Clarence 13X&#x27;s followers saw him as a divine messenger and referred to him as &quot;Father Allah&quot;. This elevated him to a higher position than Elijah Muhammad, who had deemed himself the &quot;Messenger of Allah&quot;. Eventually, Clarence 13X stopped identifying himself as a Muslim, and spoke out against the reverence of Fard Muhammad, casting him as a &quot;mystery God&quot;. He rejected the idea that God is invisible, which he felt weakened people. He encouraged his followers to learn about and respect other spiritual traditions.

Female converts were initially referred to as &quot;nurses&quot;. Clarence 13X renamed them &quot;earths&quot; in 1967. He taught that women were not gods, as he believed that they were created by man and did not possess creative power. In his view, women could nurture, but only men could make children. Women were said to resemble the Earth in their ability to sustain life. Clarence 13X had a patriarchal philosophy, and the Five Percenters were initially overwhelmingly male. He spoke in favor of fathers&#x27; arranging their daughters&#x27; marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as God. Polygamy or serial monogamy was allowed, and legal marriage was discouraged. Clarence 13X encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control.

==Opposition==
NOI leaders were angry that Clarence 13X freely taught portions of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members. Although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop, Clarence refused. Clarence 13X also experienced conflict within his family: his children did not revere him, and hostility quickly developed between core Five Percenters and some of his sons when Willeen Jowers brought them to visit him.

On December 9, 1964, Clarence 13X was shot twice in the torso, while at a popular gathering place in the basement of a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown. Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence 13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence 13X&#x27;s companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence 13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.

The Five Percenters soon attracted attention from media and law enforcement. Local papers published negative coverage of the group, describing them as a violent hate group or a street gang. The &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; reported that Clarence 13X had threatened to kill white children if his group did not receive a government subsidy. In 1965, the FBI initiated an investigation of his group and may have provided sensationalized rumors to the press. That year, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover described Clarence 13X as a &quot;Harlem rowdy&quot;, and feared that he would form ties with more dangerous groups. The FBI developed a detailed file on Clarence 13X. In 1967, Hoover described him as a potential threat to President Lyndon B. Johnson, and sent a detailed folder about him to the United States Secret Service.

==Arrest==

After Malcolm X&#x27;s death in 1965, Clarence 13X mourned his loss but did not attend his funeral. In May 1965, while visiting the site of Mosque No. 7, then closed, 13X and several of his companions were told to leave by a police officer. They left, and began to vandalize nearby buildings, and blocked the street near the former headquarters of Muslim Mosque, Inc. More police arrived and subdued 13X after an altercation, bringing him into custody with several of his followers. After being arrested, he refused to identify himself and was charged with assault and drug possession.

About 60 of his followers attended his arraignment, but were removed from the court after shouting &quot;Peace&quot;. 13X proclaimed his innocence and announced his intent to defend himself in court. He told the judge that he was Allah, and that the city would face grave judgment if he were not released. The judge disregarded his prognostication and set his bail at $9,500.

At a court date in June, about 50 Five Percenters protested outside the court. Afterwards, several were arrested on charges of making Molotov cocktails. In July, the court sent 13X to Bellevue Hospital Center for a psychiatric examination. While in the hospital, he made a few disciples and communicated with some followers through a hospital window. Under his instructions, Five Percenters resisted future NOI leader Louis Farrakhan&#x27;s attempts to convert them.

Knight states that 13X&#x27;s psychiatric results were not processed for an unusually long time. He posits that the delay was due to FBI involvement and argues that 13X was a political prisoner. In November 1965, 13X was ruled incompetent to stand trial, and committed to the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene, which placed him at the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. After he declared himself Allah and a &quot;Master Gambler&quot;, the doctors concluded that he had schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type with delusions of grandeur. He faced indefinite commitment. Many Five Percenters and their converts traveled to the hospital to meet with him and receive instruction. He proselytized to fellow inmates, converting one young white man, who later became a committed follower.

While 13X was in prison, the Five Percenters continued to proselytize and teach their doctrines. He instructed his followers to adopt names different from those used in the NOI, to differentiate their group. After attaining a certain degree of knowledge of the group&#x27;s doctrines, members were allowed to adopt the surname &quot;Allah&quot; and sometimes &quot;God&quot; as a first name. This was in recognition of 13X&#x27;s teachings that black men were gods, and that each member should worship himself. His followers often took the name Allah, but refrained from referring to themselves as such in Clarence&#x27;s presence, in deference to his authority. After a 1966 decision (&quot;Pate v. Robinson&quot;) by the Supreme Court of the United States, limits were placed on the confinement of mentally ill criminals, causing many to be released. 13X was consequently released in March 1967.

==Cooperation and conflict==

In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay sought to develop closer ties with leaders of impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by concerns voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence 13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence 13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence 13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor&#x27;s official residence.

The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and with help from the National Urban League, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school&#x27;s administrators. Clarence 13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. 

In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence 13X in &quot;The Mayor&#x27;s Man&quot;. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it, after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence 13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.

In February 1968, Lindsay estimated that there were about 500 to 700 Five Percenters. Some of Clarence 13X&#x27;s followers attempted to create break-away groups, proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements. They generally retained aspects of Five Percenter doctrine with different emphases.

After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, Lindsay feared that rioting would occur in Harlem. He traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences. Clarence 13X and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets. Clarence 13X instructed his followers to try to prevent violence and looting. He was commended by the city&#x27;s leadership for his efforts, and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of Five Percenter teachings and portions of the Quran. 

Willieen Jowers recalled that Clarence 13X admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time. He later described himself as &quot;neither anti-white nor pro-black&quot; and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings. His white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in Harlem during the February 1969 nor&#x27;easter. He was accepted as a Five Percenter, as Clarence 13X maintained that &quot;civilization&quot;—rather than race—was valued by the group. Clarence 13X made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed. 

Contrary to his radical reputation, Clarence endorsed some conservative positions in the late 1960s, including capital punishment, respect for the U.S. flag, and American involvement in Vietnam. He allowed his supporters to attend Christmas celebrations. Knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement. Clarence 13X was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young Five Percenters and won some concessions from the institution&#x27;s leadership. Some secular black leaders disliked him, owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric. On one occasion, he was invited to address an audience of black Marxists, then spoke to them about numerology.

Around 1968, Clarence 13X fathered a son with a young convert named Gusavia. That year, Gloria Steinem published an article about Clarence 13X in &quot;New York&quot; magazine. She blamed the NOI for the previous attempt to kill Clarence, arguing that they were angered by his claim to be Allah and thus above Elijah Muhammad. Clarence 13X also received coverage from international media, including a Canadian television program.

==Death==
By 1969, Clarence 13X was sleeping little. He feared that he would be killed, and instructed his followers to remain strong if he died. On June 12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith&#x27;s house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants, who fatally shot him while he was in the lobby of her apartment building, at 21 West 112th Street in Harlem, within the Martin Luther King Jr. Towers housing project. That morning, several people from the mayor&#x27;s office met with his family. The mayor later visited the Five Percenters&#x27; school to express condolences.

Clarence 13X&#x27;s funeral was held four days after his death. It was attended by about 400 people and was followed by a procession through Harlem. His death put the leadership of his movement in question—there was no clear successor. At that time, his followers were primarily teenagers, and several of his top leaders subsequently struggled with drug addiction.

Most local media sources gave Clarence 13X positive coverage in the wake of his death. The &quot;Daily News&quot; connected his murder with the recent death of NOI activist Charles Kenyatta, casting them as part of a &quot;Muslim War&quot;. The mayor believed that the NYPD told them this and was angered by their claim. Louis Farrakhan denied culpability, maintaining that he had good relations with Clarence 13X. NYPD investigators suspected that he was killed by members of an extortion ring, possibly connected to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. In August 1969, an arrest was made in connection with his murder. The suspect denied involvement, and charges were soon dropped. Five Percenters have posited different culprits, including the CIA, the NOI, or a disgruntled follower.

==Legacy and reception==
Five Percenter membership plunged after Clarence 13X&#x27;s death, but rebounded in 1970 after new leadership emerged and revitalized the group. After his death, the group was not dominated by a single leader. This may have been a result of their teaching that all black men are gods, which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable.

Knight doubts that Clarence 13X set out to build a movement or a culture, but after his death, the movement expanded and gained converts across the United States. Five Percenters have celebrated Clarence 13X&#x27;s birthday as a holiday, and minimized the descriptions of his flaws in their accounts of his life. Numerous apocryphal stories from his life have circulated among the group. Some accounts claim that he gambled, only as a means to reach others with his teachings. He did not leave behind a record of his teachings, and the group had few formalized tenets at the time of his death. In the following decades, the group&#x27;s doctrine became more complicated.

Akbar Muhammad of the NOI described Clarence 13X as &quot;confused&quot;. Relations between the Five Percenters and NOI leaders have improved over time. Clarence 13X&#x27;s teachings may have influenced the doctrines of Dwight York, founder of the Nuwaubian Nation. York saw Clarence 13X&#x27;s teachings as an insufficient, incomplete path.

Lawyer Sidney Davidoff, one of Lindsay&#x27;s assistants, deemed Clarence 13X &quot;a little bit snake-oil salesman and a little bit crazy, but no more unstable than anyone else preaching a gospel on the street corner.&quot; Davidoff saw Clarence 13X&#x27;s black supremacist teachings as a way to instill confidence in young people. Knight states that Clarence 13X went from a &quot;&#x27;Harlem rowdy&#x27; to [a] legitimate community leader&quot;. Lindsay later cast Clarence 13X&#x27;s role in the city as similar to that of Al Sharpton.

<text>The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) develops and publishes uniform public health procedures involving zoonotic disease (diseases transmitted from animals to people) in the United States and its territories. These veterinarians work closely with emergency rooms, legislators, local officials, schools, health departments, and the general public to prevent disease exposure and control diseases that are transmitted to humans from animals and animal products.

==About the Association==
 The Association provides the following services: &lt;br&gt;
-a communication network between and for its members,&lt;br&gt;
-education and resources to the public health community and general public, and &lt;br&gt;
-prevention and control guidance on zoonotic disease issues.

State Public Health Veterinarians hold at least one annual meeting, but the President of the Association can call more if necessary, and groups of veterinarians can also meet in quorums.

The Association was started in 1953 as the &quot;Association of State and Territorial Public Health Veterinarians&quot;. This Association had the same basic objectives. It was during this time that the National Standard Rabies Vaccination Certificate was adopted, and it was a part of the ban on pet sales of baby turtles.

With declining support from the CDC and difficulty taking progressive action, the Association voted to become the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, and independent incorporated organization, in 1970. Trouble with rabies vaccine reports prompted the NASPHV to take the responsibility for the annual Rabies Compendium in 1975, and with support, it has created the standardized procedure found in the compendium today. In the 1980s, NASPHV began to publish Zoonotic Infection Practice Papers, which led to the Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease and Injury Associated with Animals in Public Settings, first published in 2003.

The current membership in the Association is about 160 veterinarians.

==NASPHV Publications==
 The Association publishes four compendia: 
* Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control
* Compendium of Measures To Control Chlamydophila psittaci Infection Among Humans (Psittacosis) and Pet Birds (Avian Chlamydiosis)
* Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settings
* Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions for Zoonotic Disease Prevention in Veterinary Personnel

===Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control===
The purpose of this compendium is to standardize procedures concerning rabies prevention and control, in both domestic animals and wildlife. It provides recommendations which are meant to contribute to the national rabies control program.

The latest revision of this compendium was published May 31, 2011.

Recent changes to the compendium include:&lt;br&gt;
-Addition of national case definition for animal rabies to provide clarification &lt;br&gt;
-Expansion of Part I A.9. to clarify use of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rabies laboratory, include testing methodology for appropriate field testing, and clarify ante mortem procedure &lt;br&gt;
-Expansion of Part I A.11. to include topics warranting further study &lt;br&gt;
-Update to table of rabies vaccines licensed and marketed in the U.S.

===Compendium of Measures to Control Chlamydophila psittaci Infection Among Humans and Pet Birds===
The purpose of this compendium is to provide information about Chlamydophila psittaci to all those concerned with the control of the disease, which had 66 reported human cases between 2005 and 2009. It includes standardized procedures to control avian chlamydiosis in birds, which causes the disease in humans.

The latest revision of this compendium was published in 2010.

===Compendium of Measures to Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settings===
The purpose of this compendium is to provide guidelines to reduce risk of spreading zoonotic disease when in contact with animals, since the number of disease outbreaks associated with this type of contact increased from 1991 to 2005.

The latest revision of this compendium was published May 6, 2011.

Recent changes to the compendium include: &lt;br&gt;
-Revision of the list of references to include recent publications and disease outbreaks &lt;br&gt;
-Update of information about indirect transmission of zoonotic infection through contact with contaminated areas and objects &lt;br&gt;
-Addition of new procedures for intensive animal contact venues like farm day camps&lt;br&gt;
-Expansion of information regarding zoonotic influenza

===Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions for Zoonotic Disease Prevention in Veterinary Personnel===
The purpose of this compendium is to raise awareness of zoonotic diseases and provide standardized procedures for veterinary practice and infection control.

The latest revision of this compendium was published in 2010.

==NASPHV Contributions==

SPHVs study and provide the public with services such as: 
*knowledge of and studies concerning antimicrobial resistance
*discovery and knowledge about 150 zoonotic diseases in the U.S.
*investigation of outbreaks of &quot;E. coli&quot;, cryptosporidiosis, pfiesteria, Salmonellosis, West Nile virus, Lyme disease, rabies
*exclusive knowledge/training concerning parasites, vectors, other hosts of zoonotic diseases
*management of animal control and animal welfare agencies
*preparation of guidelines for animals in schools and health care facilities
*investigation of occupational health problems
*composition of compendiums

<doc id="1300577" wikidata="Q5019758" url="?curid=1300577" title="Grace Hopper College">
<text>Grace Hopper College is a residential college of Yale University, opened in 1933 as one of the original eight undergraduate residential colleges endowed by Edward Harkness. It was originally named Calhoun College after US Vice President John C. Calhoun, but renamed in 2017 in honor of computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper. The building was designed by John Russell Pope.

From the 1960s onward, Calhoun&#x27;s white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership had prompted calls to rename the college and remove its tributes to Calhoun. In 2016, the Yale Corporation chose to retain the Calhoun name, but in 2017 it reversed its decision and renamed the college after Hopper.

==History==

=== Before the college ===

In 1641, John Brockston established a farm on the plot of land that is now Grace Hopper College. After the American Revolutionary War an inn was constructed that would later become the meeting place of Phi Beta Kappa society. From 1863 until 1931 the land was home to the Yale Divinity School, which was housed in three buildings known as West Divinity Hall, Marquand Chapel, and East Divinity Hall. After Yale President James Rowland Angell announced the residential college plan in 1930, the Divinity School campus was demolished and a new campus built at the top of Prospect Hill, where it currently stands.

=== Construction and early history ===
Although all the other Collegiate Gothic-style colleges at Yale were conceived by James Gamble Rogers, the commission for the new college at the corner of College and Elm Streets was given to John Russell Pope, a campus planner who concurrently designed the Payne Whitney Gymnasium. The new dormitory was named Calhoun College.

Like all other residential colleges at their inception, the college had twenty-four-hour guard service and the gates were never locked. Jacket and tie was the necessary attire in the dining hall and meals were served at the table.

At first, it was considered an undesirable college because of its location at the corner of College and Elm, where trolleys frequently ran screeching around the corner. This perception changed under the popular Master Charles Schroeder, who once remarked that if the despicable trolley service were ever removed he would purchase a trolley car, put it in the courtyard, and hold a celebration to commemorate the event. The trolley system was indeed removed in 1949, and though a whole car proved unfeasible, Master Schroder secured the fare collecting machine from a trolley and made good on his promise to celebrate. Thus was born Trolley Night, a proud tradition of the college.

The coat of arms designed for Calhoun College combined the university arms, set atop the Calhoun arms (a saltire engrailed sable on a field argent). The college colors were black, navy blue, and gold.
Under the Yale College policy that let incoming students express a residential college preference, Calhoun developed a reputation for attracting athletic, upper-class elites until the policy ended with the class of 1958.

=== Later events ===

In 1989, Calhoun was the first residential college to be renovated. The renovations, mostly funded by alumnus Roger Horchow, were done quickly and over the summer to minimize disruption to student life, and by 2000, the physical plant began to show wear and tear again.

2005 saw the retirement of William and Betsy Sledge as Master and Associate Master. They were succeeded by Dr. Jonathan Holloway (PhD &#x27;95) and his wife Aisling Colón. In 2014, Holloway became the Dean of Yale College, the first African-American to hold that position. He was succeeded as Master by Julia Adams, Professor of Sociology and International and Area Studies. In the same year a limited window replacement was commissioned amid controversy over the college&#x27;s exclusion from the most recent campus-wide renovation effort.

Stephen Lassonde stepped down as dean in June 2007 thus ending one of the longest tenures in the college&#x27;s history. Within the Residential College system at Yale, deanships normally last only a few years, but Stephen Lassonde served as Calhoun Dean for fourteen years. In late April 2007, he made the official announcement that he would be leaving the college to serve as Deputy Dean of the College at Brown University in nearby Providence, Rhode Island. He was succeeded by Leslie Woodard, who died unexpectedly at her home at the college in October 2013. Until June 2007 Dean Woodard was the director of the undergraduate creative writing program at Columbia University. A published author of short stories, Dean Woodard also had a history in the performing arts; she was a professional dancer in the Dance Theater of Harlem for a decade.

In late June 2007 the college&#x27;s mighty elm, which had provided shade since the college&#x27;s foundation and also supported the college&#x27;s famous tire swing, was felled. The tree was rotting from the ground up and was beginning to lean dangerously. Given the fact that the tree was actually taller than the college (itself a five- and six-story building in different places), the tree posed a real danger to the college structure and students.

The college was eventually fully renovated over the 2008-09 school-year.

==Namesakes and Calhoun controversy==
===John C. Calhoun===
John C. Calhoun grew up on a plantation in South Carolina. He entered Yale College in November 1802. His professors included Benjamin Silliman, and Yale Presidents Jeremiah Day and Timothy Dwight. Calhoun was socially ostracized at Yale and wrote to his cousin that he found “a considerable prejudice here against both the southern states and students.” He did well academically, was selected as a member of the Linonia literary society, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1804. He was selected to give his commencement address, but was prevented from doing so by illness.

Calhoun remained in Connecticut for several years to obtain a law degree from Litchfield Law School, then returned to South Carolina. After his student years, Calhoun never again had significant involvement in Yale and was never a benefactor. Calhoun&#x27;s plantation estate later became the campus of Clemson University.

Elected to the United States Congress in 1810, he made his name as a War Hawk before the War of 1812, then became Secretary of War under President James Monroe. He was elected Vice President in 1825 and served two terms before resigning to fight for South Carolina&#x27;s nullification of federal tariffs as a Senator. During his political career, Calhoun gained a reputation as a great rhetorician and intellectual. In addition to his advocacy of states&#x27; rights, Calhoun was a proponent of slaveholder rights and believed that slavery was justified by white supremacy.

===Naming of Calhoun College===
Because of his political, military, and intellectual achievements, Calhoun was venerated as an illustrious Yale alumnus beginning in the mid-nineteenth century. He was the only Yale graduate to be elected to a federal executive office in the school&#x27;s first two centuries, until the election of U.S. President William Howard Taft in 1909. A 1914 biography of Calhoun by Yale Secretary Anson Phelps Stokes details his accomplishments as an &quot;eminent Yale man&quot; without once mentioning his slaveholdings or pro-slavery leadership.

Already holding some of Calhoun&#x27;s papers, Yale offered its first commemoration of Calhoun during the construction of the Memorial Quadrangle in 1917. Statues of eight pre-20th century &quot;Yale worthies&quot; were placed on Harkness Tower, including an eight-foot statue of Calhoun. Of these, only Calhoun and Jonathan Edwards were selected as namesakes of the eight original residential colleges when they were named around 1931.

===Re-naming debates===
A debate over the appropriateness of the college&#x27;s name has waxed and waned, as John C. Calhoun&#x27;s involvement in defending slavery has been reconsidered. In 1992, the graduating seniors commissioned a plaque noting the unfortunate reality of John C. Calhoun&#x27;s legacy, but at the same time supported the notion that the college retain its name for historical purposes. Around the same time, a pane of stained glass in the college&#x27;s common room depicting a shackled black man kneeling before Calhoun was altered to depict Calhoun alone.

After the June 2015 Charleston church shooting, radio commentators Colin McEnroe and Ray Hardman questioned whether the preservation of the college&#x27;s name was an inappropriate legacy of white supremacy. The events, which instigated student protests and alumni petitions in the same year, caused administrators to consider renaming the college. In their petition students argued that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an &quot;extraordinary American statesman&quot;—he was &quot;one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy&quot; in the history of the United States. In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed. He described Calhoun as &quot;a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina.&quot; He acknowledged that Calhoun also &quot;believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.&quot;

In April 2016 Salovey announced that &quot;despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,&quot; Calhoun&#x27;s name would remain on the Yale residential college. Salovey argued that it was preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun&#x27;s &quot;shadow&quot; so they will be &quot;better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future.&quot; He claimed that if they removed Calhoun&#x27;s name, it would &quot;obscure&quot; his &quot;legacy of slavery rather than addressing it.&quot; &quot;Yale is part of that history&quot; and &quot;We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.&quot; At the same time, Salovey announced that the title of “master” would be changed to “head of college” because of the title&#x27;s freighted use by American slaveowners.

===Artistic depictions of antebellum slavery===
Stained glass window panels in the college depicted images of slavery. One showed a black man in shackles kneeling before Calhoun. Temple University professor and co-founder of the Yale Black Alumni Network Chris Rabb advocated for that panel to be altered. The alterations replaced the black man with blank white pieces of glass. The university had plans to change some additional stained glass windows in the dining hall in 2016, but, before that was done, Corey Menafee, an African-American dishwasher who worked there, knocked out the pane that showed black slaves harvesting cotton in the fields, because, as he related, he no longer wanted to be subjected to seeing the &quot;racist, very degrading&quot; image at his place of work, but also added: &quot;There&#x27;s always better ways of doing things like that than just destroying things.&quot; Menafee was initially arrested on felony and misdemeanor charges. Yale chose not to press charges which were then dropped and, after initially accepting Menafee&#x27;s resignation, rehired him to work at a different location.

Calhoun&#x27;s name has been tied up in larger controversies about the associations of the colleges with slavery. A 2001 report revealed that at least seven of the colleges&#x27; namesakes were slave owners. In 2009, a student group protested the connection by posting alternative names for slaveowner-named colleges near the college entrances. Commenting for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Roger Kimball pointed out that Yale&#x27;s namesake, Elihu Yale, was a slave trader, and questioned how Yale can defend the name of the university against similar moral arguments.

===Renaming===
Partly because of the controversy surrounding the 2016 decision not to rename Calhoun College, Yale put in place a policy on the potential renaming of buildings and other institutions around the university. One of the first items of business the consequent task force addressed was the renaming of Calhoun College, and in February 2017 it recommended to the Yale Corporation that the college&#x27;s name be changed. The Corporation accepted that recommendation, and voted at its February 2017 meeting to change the name of Calhoun to Grace Hopper College, effective July 1, 2017.

The college&#x27;s new namesake has a tie to Yale, having received her Ph.D. from there under the direction of Øystein Ore in 1934.

The college&#x27;s new arms, designed in 2017, were intended to represent Admiral Hopper&#x27;s history, as well as to create a tie to the college&#x27;s past. The heraldic dolphin represents both leadership and Hopper&#x27;s career in the United States Navy. The rectangles and circles represent her contributions to mathematics and computer science. The scalloped (engrailed) bar is evocative of waves—and also incorporates a design element of the Calhoun College arms, which featured an engrailed saltire.

==Unique features==

The courtyard used to have a popular tire swing, which stood in stark contrast to the Neo-Gothic architecture. In fall 1990, newly appointed master Turan Onat made it his first priority to remove the tire swing as he sought &quot;to restore the courtyard to a grassier state.&quot; The seniors immediately reinstalled the swing overnight and Onat quickly reversed his policy.

The college used to be the only residential college with its own sauna. The sauna was removed from Entryway B/C during the 2005–06 school year.

The College Council is a student governing organization that coordinates activities and social life for the residential college. Throughout the year, the Council organizes numerous activities including: Study Breaks, a dorm-wide dance, and Trolley Night, an annual dance party.

<doc id="1300580" wikidata="Q5230230" url="?curid=1300580" title="Davenport College">
<text>Davenport College (colloquially referred to as D&#x27;port) is one of the fourteen residential colleges of Yale University. Its buildings were completed in 1933 mainly in the Georgian style but with a gothic façade along York Street. The college was named for John Davenport, who founded Yale&#x27;s home city of New Haven, Connecticut. An extensive renovation of the college&#x27;s buildings occurred during the 2004–2005 academic year as part of Yale&#x27;s comprehensive building renovation project. Davenport College has an unofficial rivalry with adjoining Pierson College.

==Namesake==

John Davenport was born in 1597 to draper and Mayor of Coventry Henry Davenport and Winifred Barnaby. He attended Oxford University for three years starting in 1613 before leaving without a degree. He returned to Oxford to finish his MA and Bachelor of Divinity after serving as the chaplain of Hilton Castle and vicar of St. Stephen&#x27;s Church in London. In 1633 he resigned from the Church of England after several disputes with the senior clergy.

In 1638 he sailed to North America with his congregation and a patent for a colony in Massachusetts. One year later he co-founded the city of New Haven with Theophilus Eaton and served as its burgess until his departure to Boston 30 years later. Beginning in the 1640s, Davenport advocated for the creation of a college near the New Haven Green, a vision realized by Yale College some fifty years after his death. He is also credited with co-founding the nearby Hopkins School.

In 1668, Davenport left New Haven to serve as the pastor of the First Church in Boston. His invitation to that position was not without opposition due to his strict Puritan values, especially regarding infant baptism. Davenport died of apoplexy less than two years later.

==Buildings and architecture==
===The College===

Davenport College was, like many of Yale&#x27;s residential colleges, designed by James Gamble Rogers. It has two distinct styles of architecture: The York Street facade is constructed from gothically-detailed sandstone while the remainder of the college has been built in the red-brick Georgian style of the colonial era. This &quot;hybridization&quot; is meant to complement the monumental gothic streetscape of York Street, on which the western façades of the Branford and Saybrook College complex along with Jonathan Edwards College stand opposite the gothic-inspired Yale Daily News building and University Theater. On the inner, Georgian face, the college entrance has an adaptation of the eastern façade of the original Massachusetts Statehouse, in which the British imperial lion and unicorn have been replaced by a pair of yales. The inner face was featured in the 2008 movie The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.
The enclosed space of Davenport College features three courtyards: Kumble Court (usually referred to as the &quot;upper courtyard&quot;), the lower courtyard and a recently created stone courtyard in front of the dean&#x27;s suite, the result of the annexation of the former Yale Record building during the 2004–2005 renovations. A half-story terrace and two house-like residential units (one dubbed &quot;The Cottage&quot;) flank the upper courtyard to the north. Traditionally, the college&#x27;s sophomores live in the suites bordering the lower courtyard, while most of the juniors and seniors of the College live around the upper courtyard.

Separating the two main courtyards is the Crosspiece, housing both the Dean&#x27;s and Head&#x27;s Offices and a classroom space as well as carrels and reading rooms extending from the college&#x27;s Spitzer Library. The Crosspiece formerly held a second library in the top floor which has since been converted to student housing, with the book holdings moved into the expanded Library. Indoor spaces of architectural note include the Davenport Common Room, the aforementioned Spitzer Library and the Dining Hall. The Dining Hall&#x27;s walls are adorned with a two-panel portrait showcasing the diversity of the college&#x27;s staff and students. A Waterford crystal chandelier hangs from the dining hall&#x27;s ceiling.

The student buttery, or &quot;The Dive&quot;, is the snack shop. An entertainment center—and game room is nearby. The Davenport basement also includes a letterpress print-shop, a pottery studio, a digital media arts center, a dance studio, and a small theater with stadium seating. These are all shared with students in Pierson. Davenport students also have access to shared facilities on the Pierson side of the basement, including music practice rooms and an exercise room containing treadmills, ellipticals, and free weights.

===Freshman housing===

Davenport College freshmen live on the Old Campus with the rest of their Yale College class, with the exception of students from Silliman, Timothy Dwight, Pauli Murray, and Benjamin Franklin. Currently, Davenport College freshmen live in Welch Hall, which is located next to Phelps Gate. Welch is known for the 10- and 12-pack suites on the bottom floor (for 10 and 12 students) and the princess suites on the top two floors, complete with cathedral ceilings and skylights.

== History ==

Under the Yale College policy that let incoming students express a residential college preference, Davenport developed a reputation for attracting athletic, upper-class elites until the policy ended with the class of 1958.

For a while after Davenport College&#x27;s inception into the Yale residential college system, students were known as &quot;Hybrids,&quot; a reference to the hybrid style of the college&#x27;s architecture. While the nickname appeared in a few official publications in the 1970s, it was no longer used by either Davenporters or their rivals. Davenport students were without a title or figure to rally behind.

In 1998, then junior Thomas Shaw, upon returning from a semester of mountaineering, brought back from the California Redwood country a five-and-a-half foot tall, 400 pound carved wooden gnome as a gift to the college. The gnome, with its green painted shirt and yellow pants, quickly developed a following in the Davenport community, and was soon proudly adopted as the college&#x27;s official mascot.

The gnome was first placed in the college&#x27;s courtyard, but after repeated theft by neighbor and unofficial Davenport rival Pierson, the gnome was relocated inside. It was in the entrance of the administrative offices in Crosspiece for the first semester of the 2005–2006 school year, but was moved to the Davenport Dining Hall. In April 2011, Davenport students stopped a group of Piersonites from the most recent attempt at stealing the gnome. The gnome was successfully rescued and taken to its home in the Davenport Dining Hall.

==Intramurals==

Davenport College has competed for the Tyng Cup, winning the championship 4 times. The college&#x27;s ice hockey team has won 16 championships, most recently in 1997. Davenport is the current coed football champion and has won championships in table tennis, golf, bowling, men&#x27;s volleyball, swimming, softball, and track and field in the past 5 years.

<doc id="1300584" wikidata="Q5423410" url="?curid=1300584" title="Ezra Stiles College">
<text>Ezra Stiles College is one of the fourteen residential colleges at Yale University, built in 1961 and designed by Eero Saarinen. The college is named after Ezra Stiles, the seventh President of Yale. Architecturally, it is known for its lack of right angles between walls in the living areas. It sits next to Morse College.

==Origin==
In his report on the 1955–56 academic year, Yale President A. Whitney Griswold announced his intention to add at least one residential college to Yale&#x27;s two-decade-old system. &quot;We have the colleges so full that community life, discipline, education, even sanitation are suffering,&quot; he said. After several years of speculation about the possibility of four or five new colleges, the university confirmed the construction of two new colleges in spring 1959, choosing Eero Saarinen &#x27;34 as the project architect and the Old York Square behind the Graduate School as the site. The Old Dominion Foundation, established by Paul Mellon &#x27;29, provided funding for the construction of Stiles and Morse, calling for the building of two &quot;radically different&quot; Yale colleges in order to reduce over-crowding.

==Design==

The college is built of rubble masonry in the style of pre-Gothic Tuscan towers, similar to those in the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano. Many architecture critics regard the college as a &quot;masterpiece of American architecture,&quot; though it is considered one of the &quot;ugly ducklings&quot; of Yale. The college consists of many single rooms and suites, and in a modern attempt to capture the spirit of Gothic architecture, Saarinen eliminated all right angles from the living areas.

Stiles&#x27; adjacent &quot;twin&quot; residential college Morse is architecturally similar, was built at the same time, and has an adjoining dining room with a common kitchen. Architecturally, Morse and Stiles differ from older colleges by having more private space per student and the lowest ratio of natural light aperture to wall surface.

Saarinen wrote in a description of the architectural plans: &quot;Somehow, the architecture had to declare them as colleges, not dormitories.&quot; Saarinen continued: &quot;We have made the buildings polygonal—their shapes derived in order to provide the diversity of student rooms, to answer the needs of the site, and to give variety and sequence of spatial experiences in the courts. We conceived of these colleges as citadels of earthy, monolithic masonry - buildings where masonry walls would be dominant and whose interiors of stone, oak, and plaster would carry out the spirit of strength and simplicity. Since handicraft methods are anachronistic, we found a new technological method for making these walls: these are &#x27;modern&#x27; masonry walls made without masons.&quot;

Because none of the interior walls make right angles, many of Stiles&#x27; dorm rooms are furnished with built-in desks and bookshelves. The college was once heated by a system that warmed the stone floors, but maintenance troubles led Yale to abandon it and install radiators.

The back of the Yale University bookstore acts as a wall in the courtyard.

In fall 2010, the refurbishment of adjoining Morse College gave Stiles students access to a new gym, dance studio, and the Underground Crescent Theater. Work on Stiles itself began in summer 2010, and was complete by August 2011. Among other things, it added suites to the college and refurbished several massive lighting fixtures designed by UCLA sculptor Oliver Andrews, meant to be abstract and contemporary versions of &quot;the sort of thing you&#x27;d find in an ancient castle&quot;.

==Student life==
The mascot is the A. Bartlett Giamatti Memorial Moose. Ezra Stiles students presented the college with the taxidermy moose head in 1972 when they found out that the then College Master A. Bartlett Giamatti would be leaving the role with instructions not to hang his picture in the college, as had been the custom. Giamatti in 1977 became Yale&#x27;s youngest president, and in 1989 was named Commissioner of Baseball. Giamatti&#x27;s son, actor Paul Giamatti, lived in the Head of college&#x27;s House on the Ezra Stiles College grounds from birth through age five. The moose appears on much of the Ezra Stiles apparel and is part of the Ezra Stiles cheer.

Stiles has had success in Yale&#x27;s intramural sports program, winning the Tyng Cup — presented to the residential college with the best intramural sports performance — in 1964, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 2003, 2004, and 2005. This 10-cup total places Stiles just one behind leaders Pierson College and Timothy Dwight College. More recently, the college has taken second place behind Silliman College, which won the Cup in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Stiles also won the intramural water polo championship in 2020, making it the first major Stiles intramural win in a several-year-long drought.

Ezra Stiles and Morse used to co-host an annual Casino Night since the early 1990s, until it was shut down due to legal concerns. A formal affair, the event featured casino-style games and live music. Stilesians also host an annual &quot;Medieval (K)night.&quot; For one night in April, the dining hall is transformed into a medieval banquet hall, and students enjoy medieval fare and dramatic re-enactments of &quot;Beowulf&quot; and dragon battles after besieging and pillaging rival colleges. In addition to raiding other colleges, Stiles has historically also pranked their fellow residential colleges. In 2019, the &quot;Morse&quot; banner in the Morse dining hall was edited overnight to read &quot;Moose&quot;. While the culprits were never caught, Stilesians were the prime suspects.

The college is well known for a robust arts community, maintaining a student-run art gallery, and holding &quot;Stiles Arts Week&quot; for over 40 years. During Arts Week, the college hosts study breaks and activities which have included painting pots for succulents, workshops in stop-motion animation, and open mic nights. For Arts Week 2020, the week kicked off with a 12-hour knitting marathon called &quot;The Great Knit.&quot; Recently Arts Week has included the Stiles Student Film Festival, a formal affair featuring films from all Yale students regardless of major or residential college affiliation. Arts Week culminates in a &quot;classical brunch,&quot; in which Stiles musicians perform classical music during brunch.

<text>Morse College is one of the fourteen residential colleges at Yale University, built in 1961 and designed by Eero Saarinen. It is adjacent to Ezra Stiles College and the two colleges share many facilities. The current Head of College is Catherine Panter-Brick. The Associate Head of College is Mark Eggerman. Blake Trimble is the Dean of Morse College.

==Origin==
In his report on the year 1955-56, Yale President A. Whitney Griswold announced his intention to add at least one more residential college to the system Yale had launched only two decades earlier. &quot;We have the colleges so full that community life, discipline, education, even sanitation are suffering,&quot; he stated. This news bred wild rumors about four or five new colleges being added to Yale&#x27;s system. Nothing substantial was announced until the spring of 1959 when Eero Saarinen &#x27;34 was chosen as the architect, and the Old York Square behind the Graduate School became the designated site. New Haven high schools, Boardman Manual Training School and Hillhouse High School were demolished to make way for the colleges. 

The Old Dominion Foundation, established by Paul Mellon &#x27;29, provided money to build two &quot;radically different&quot; colleges, which would alleviate the growing strain on the older colleges. Mellon&#x27;s gift of $15 million led to the development of Morse and its adjacent college, Ezra Stiles College. Morse College is named after Samuel Morse.

==Design==
Morse College is an eclectic structure built on an odd, angular site with many design features that are reminiscent of Tuscan villages, most notably San Gimignano. The college&#x27;s original construction consisted almost entirely of single rooms, and in a modern attempt to capture the spirit of Gothic architecture, Saarinen eliminated all right angles from the living areas. (Scully called the design an &quot;anti-Masonic satire in brick and mortar.&quot; There are, of course, right angles in every window, between the floors and the walls, and the walls and the ceilings.) This resulted, notoriously, in two rooms which had eleven walls, none of which was long enough to put the bed against and still be able to open the door. 

In a 1959 article in the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, Eero Saarinen discussed his design for Morse, noting &quot;[o]ur primary effort was to create an architecture which would recognize the individual as individual instead of an anonymous integer in a group.&quot; However, right angles have been reintroduced into the architecture of Morse College after renovation in 2010.

The college provides several amenities to its resident &quot;Morsels.&quot; The fourteen-story main tower provides an inspiring view of all of New Haven. The college&#x27;s common areas include air hockey, pool, ping-pong, foosball, and a big-screen TV. A quieter atmosphere is found in &quot;Ericka&#x27;s Room&quot;, a space filled with comfy couches, a TV, and board games. &quot;Ericka&#x27;s Room&quot; memorializes Ericka Bishop &#x27;97, who was killed by a drunk driver just prior to the start of her junior year in Morse.

Morse has an adjacent &quot;twin&quot; residential college named &quot;Ezra Stiles&quot; which is architecturally similar and was built at the same time. The two distinct colleges share a combined dining hall, over which runs a public walkway to the Payne Whitney Gymnasium. Architecturally, Morse and Stiles differ from their predecessors by having more private space per student, and the lowest ratio of natural light aperture to wall surface of any other colleges. Morse and Stiles have unique architecture that sets them apart from the other colleges and sometimes against each other. The Morse-Stiles rivalry is decades old.

Morse College was entirely renovated during 2009-2010. The top-to-bottom refurbishment updated the facilities of the college to meet growing student needs while preserving the design and style Morse is known for.

The centerpiece of the renovation project is its new underground recreational spaces, including a theater, music practice rooms, a weaving studio, a recording studio, a digital media room, exercise facilities, and spaces for dance and aerobics. The space joins Morse with neighboring Ezra Stiles College via an underground courtyard spanned by a pedestrian bridge. The former 11,699 square feet of shared social space in Morse and Stiles swelled to 15,300 after the renovations. Pierson and Davenport, by comparison, together have 14,638.

Other completed work at Morse includes an upgrade of all mechanical and electrical facilities, a new roof, new windows, updates to meet fire-safety and handicapped-accessibility codes, and air conditioning for public spaces and the Head of College&#x27;s suite. Student rooms, common rooms, the gallery, game room, and the buttery have also been upgraded to accommodate the goal of Yale&#x27;s residential college system as a center for social interaction. There has also been a major reconfiguration of the kitchen and servery that expands the capacity of the dining halls in both Morse and Stiles.

Morse College freshmen are housed exclusively in the historic Durfee Hall, which, built in 1871, is among the oldest buildings on Yale&#x27;s Old Campus. It is known for its unique housing quarters, 80% of which are singles—the highest percentage of any freshman housing. Durfee Hall has twelve-foot vaulted ceilings, hardwood floors, at least two fireplaces per suite, and a unique walk-through suite system that allows residents access to all floors and stairwells of the building. In the 1980s, Morse freshmen lived in Vanderbilt Hall.

<doc id="1300591" wikidata="Q888553" url="?curid=1300591" title="Kalaallit">
<text>Kalaallit are a Greenlandic Inuit ethnic group, being the largest group in Greenland, concentrated in the west. It is also a contemporary term in the Greenlandic language for the Indigenous of Greenland (). The Kalaallit (singular: ) are a part of the Arctic Inuit. The language spoken by Inuit in Greenland is known as Kalaallisut, known in English as Greenlandic.

== Name ==
Probably adapted from the name &quot;Skræling&quot;, &quot;Kalaallit&quot; historically referred specifically to Western Greenlanders. 
On the other hand, Northern and Eastern Greenlanders call themselves Inughuit and Tunumiit, respectively. About 80% to 88% of Greenland&#x27;s population, or approximately 44,000 to 50,000 people identify as being Inuit.

==History==
Kalaallit are descended from the Thule people but probably not from their predecessors in Greenland, the Dorset culture.

==Regions==
As 84% of Greenland&#x27;s landmass is covered by the Greenland ice sheet, Kalaallit live in three regions: Polar, Eastern, and Western. In the 1850s some Canadian Inuit migrated to Greenland and joined the Polar Inuit communities.

The Eastern Inuit, or &quot;Tunumiit&quot;, live in the area with the mildest climate, a territory called &quot;Ammassalik&quot;. Hunters can hunt marine mammals from kayaks throughout the year.

The Northeast Greenland Inuit are now extinct. Douglas Clavering (1794–1827) met a group of twelve Inuit, including men, women and children, in Clavering Island in August 1823. There are many remains of former Inuit settlements in different locations of the now desolate area, but the population died out before mid-19th century.

==Art==
The Kalaallit have a strong artistic tradition based on sewing animal skins and making masks. They are also known for an art form of figures called &quot;tupilaq&quot;, or &quot;evil spirit object.&quot; Traditional art-making practices thrive in the &quot;Ammassalik&quot;. Sperm whale ivory remains a valued medium for carving.

<text>Pierson College is a residential college at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Opened in 1933, it is named for Abraham Pierson, a founder and the first rector of the Collegiate School, the college later known as Yale. With just under 500 undergraduate members, Pierson is the largest of Yale&#x27;s residential colleges by number of students.

==History==

Yale built the Pierson College buildings in the Georgian or &quot;Georgian Revival&quot; architectural style. These include a prominent tower, inspired by that of Philadelphia&#x27;s Independence Hall. It is one of the eight original residential colleges bequeathed by Edward Harkness and designed by James Gamble Rogers.

Pierson College&#x27;s first master was Alan Valentine, then in 1935 international relations scholar Arnold Wolfers took over the role, one he held until 1949. Wolfers and his wife Doris made the Master&#x27;s House at Pierson a center for entertaining on the campus second only to the house of the president of the university. Among those they hosted where diplomats who visited the campus.

During World War II, Wolfers played a significant role in recruiting students into the intelligence services such as the OSS, and overall a disproportionate number of intelligence workers came from Pierson College. In addition to Wolfers, other Pierson fellows who did recruiting included Wallace Notestein and C. Bradford Welles. Pierson College residents who later became intelligence figures included future CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton, who often spent time in Wolfers&#x27; living room listening to poets such as Robert Frost that Wolfers brought in to read. Other attendees to these sessions included a future U.S. Poet Laureate, Reed Whittemore.

In 2004, Yale completed a year long renovation of Pierson as part of a campaign to rehabilitate all twelve colleges. Major changes included the reconfiguration of existing suites and rooms, the move of the &quot;Dean&#x27;s&quot; office, the addition of a new residential building, Upper Court. Most significantly, the renovation joined the basements of Pierson its adjacent and rival residential college, Davenport, giving the colleges common facilities.

The courtyard was home to George Rickey&#x27;s kinetic sculpture, &quot;Two Planes Vertical—Horizontal II&quot; for many years, but the sculpture has now been moved to the courtyard of the Yale University Art Gallery.

==Namesake==
Abraham Pierson was born in Southampton, Long Island in 1646 and was an early student at Harvard College. After many years as a Congregational minister in Newark, New Jersey, he assumed the pulpit in Killingworth, Connecticut in 1694. While presiding there, he and five other ministers established the third college in the American colonies, the Collegiate School, in 1701. Pierson was elected its first rector, but unable to leave his position in Killingworth, he taught courses from his parsonage in present-day Clinton. Pierson died in his sixth year as Yale&#x27;s rector, in 1707.

A statue of Pierson stands on Yale&#x27;s Old Campus. Since there are no known portraits of Pierson, the statue is an &quot;imaginative recreation.&quot;

==Student life==

Pierson freshmen are currently housed in Lanman-Wright Hall on Old Campus, along with freshmen from Berkeley College. Wright Hall represents the first half of the old Yale freshman saying: &quot;Wright bites, Durfee sucks!&quot; Wright Hall was renamed Lanman-Wright Hall after William K. Lanman &#x27;28 donated renovation funds in 1993 and is now referred to by Piersonites as &quot;L-Dub.&quot;

Pierson has been traditionally renowned for its thriving social life and once had the reputation of consistently trailing other Yale residential colleges in academic rankings. In fact, Pierson&#x27;s rallying cry at one time was, &quot;Tyng, Tang, and GPA,&quot; reflecting Pierson&#x27;s reputation for winning Yale intramural sports (Tyng), an annual drinking competition among the residential colleges (Tang), and having the lowest average GPA of all the residential colleges. In 2004, 2018, and 2021, however, Pierson has been awarded the Gimbel Cup for highest average GPA at Yale. In light of new Connecticut alcohol laws, Dean Amerigo Fabbri has cracked down on events such as Tuesday Night Club (TNC), founded in 1981, restricting the event to Pierson seniors. However, in 2006, Pierson students were able to organize a successful Inferno, the traditional Pierson Halloween party. TNC was traditionally held in the &quot;Lower Courtyard&quot; of Pierson. Lower Courtyard housing is generally occupied by seniors.

Another Pierson tradition is Pierson Day, which typically falls on the last day of classes of the academic year. On Pierson Day, the Head of Pierson College wrestles another College Head, student, or other willing opponent in a ring filled with yellow jello.

Pierson achieved world renown in 1977 as a result of the still-famous television broadcast of its Bladderball &#x27;victory&#x27;. Pierson&#x27;s most storied tradition is the theft of Davenport College&#x27;s gnome mascot. Pierson&#x27;s famous &quot;fight song,&quot; heard annually at &quot;the Game&quot; between the Yale and Harvard football teams, starts off with: &quot;&#x27;P&#x27; is for the &#x27;P&#x27; in Pierson College; &#x27;I&#x27; is for the &#x27;I&#x27; in Pierson College,&quot; and continues in predictable fashion.

Among the activities for which Pierson is known is the Pierson Press, one of the most active of Yale&#x27;s many traditional letterpress print shops. It was founded over half a century ago and nurtured by a succession of Pierson Heads including John Hersey, Quincy Porter, Gaddis Smith, and Harvey Goldblatt. For many years the Press was located in a converted squash court in Pierson Tower, designed by Charles Willard Moore of the Yale School of Architecture. During the renovation of the college in 2004, it was relocated to enhanced facilities in the basement, where it now shares space with the Davenport Press in a greatly expanded Book Arts Center that includes half a dozen presses, over 1000 cases of hand type, a book bindery, paper mill and more. Over 75 Pierson and Davenport students attended the college&#x27;s rigorous Apprentice Course during the Fall of 2005.

The basement of Pierson is also home to the Pierson Buttery. The Buttery is run by students and offers a variety of late night food options that can be ordered online. In the Spring of 2007, Pierson won the annual Freshmen Olympics, held on Old Campus. The Class of 2010 beat the eleven other residential colleges in Pierson&#x27;s first ever Freshman Olympics victory. Since then, Pierson has won the Freshman Olympics several times, most recently in 2014.

Pierson&#x27;s Fellowship, consisting of both faculty members and distinguished outside Associate Fellows, is one of the most active at Yale. The Fellows meet twice monthly during the academic year, generously support undergraduate activities in the college, including social events such as the annual Pierson Inferno at Halloween. Throughout its history, the group has consisted of a diverse and dignified range of members, from poet Robert Frost to actor George Takei (Sulu of Star Trek fame) to G. D. Mostow the mathematician of Mostow rigidity theorem fame and Calvin Hill, NFL Rookie of the Year and multiple Pro Bowl selectee.

Pierson was home to one of the longest serving Yale residential college deans, Dean Christa Dove &#x27;76MPhil. Within the Residential College system at Yale, deanships normally last only a few years. Dove, however, was Dean of Pierson College for 22 years, from 1983 to 2005.
The renovation of 2003-04 was extensive, and included the reconfiguration of student suites, student activities areas, and dining facilities; new bathrooms, new interior finishes and lighting; additional student rooms in a new Upper Court building; complete replacement of all mechanical and electrical systems; new security, fire protection, and information technology systems; new elevators, ramps, and other enhancements to accessibility; and repairs to windows, masonry, roofs, and gutters. The renovation also included enlarging the library and adding a mezzanine level computer cluster. The completion of the additional building, called &quot;Upper Court&quot;, increased Pierson College&#x27;s dorm space capacity from 264 to 310. During the renovation, students who would otherwise live in Pierson College, lived in what is called &quot;Swing Space,&quot; dormitories located near Payne Whitney Gymnasium that resemble a cheap hotel and do not include a dining hall.

A number of the songs from Dirty Projectors&#x27; Don Henley and Hernán Cortés infused glitch-opera, The Getty Address, were recorded in Pierson College, as Dave Longstreth was a student at Yale.

Pierson&#x27;s sister college is Lowell House at Harvard University.

The inaugural Pierson College all-alumni reunion was recently held in New Haven from February 15–17, 2013, coinciding with the 80th year of the college&#x27;s existence. Notable Pierson alumni in attendance included Howard Dean, PC &#x27;71, and George Pataki, PC &#x27;67. Also honored during the celebration were Head of College Harvey Goldblatt, who completed his 19th and final year as Head of Pierson College in May 2013, and Yale&#x27;s then President-elect (now President) Peter Salovey.

<text>Joshi is a surname used by the Brahmin (caste) in India and Nepal. Joshi is also sometimes spelled as Jyoshi.

<text>The Port Tobacco River is a tidal tributary of the Potomac River in Charles County, Maryland, in the United States. The river is about long. Port Tobacco, the county seat of Charles County from 1658 to 1895, was an active port until that portion of the river became silted and unnavigable. When the railroad bypassed the town, business declined, and the county seat was moved to La Plata, Maryland.

<text>Pralatrexate, sold under the brand name Folotyn, is a medication used for the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

Pralatrexate was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2009, as the first treatment for Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL), an often aggressive type of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.

== Medical uses ==
Pralatrexate is indicated for the treatment of people with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

==Mechanism==
Pralatrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor.

==Discovery==
Research on this class of drugs began in the 1950s at SRI International, where scientists were focused on developing new chemotherapies and antifolates that would be effective against tumor cells.

In the late 1970s, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center discovered that cancerous cells take in natural folate through a protein identified as plasma membrane transporter (now referred to as &quot;reduced folate carrier type 1&quot; or &quot;RFC-1&quot;). Further research showed that when normal cells evolve into cancerous cells they often overproduce RFC-1 to ensure they get enough folate.

A subsequent scientific collaboration was ultimately formed among SRI International, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the Southern Research Institute with the intention of developing an antifolate with greater therapeutic selectivity – an agent that could be more effectively internalized into tumors (transported into the cells through RFC-1) and would be more toxic to cancer cells than normal cells.

This collaboration, supported by the National Cancer Institute, led to the identification of pralatrexate in the mid-1990s. Pralatrexate was later licensed to Allos Therapeutics in 2002 for further development. Allos Therapeutics, Inc. was acquired by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on September 5, 2012. Allos is a wholly owned subsidiary of Spectrum.

== Society and culture ==

=== Legal status ===
Pralatrexate was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2009.

=== Economics ===
Some oncologists, patient groups, and insurance companies criticized the cost of $30,000 a month or more, which could reach a total of $126,000 during a course of treatment.

<text>Silliman College is a residential college at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, named for scientist and Yale professor Benjamin Silliman. It opened in September 1940 as the last of the original ten residential colleges, and contains buildings constructed as early as 1901.

Silliman is Yale&#x27;s largest residential college by its footprint, occupying most of a city block. Due to its size, the college is able to house its freshmen in the college instead of on Yale&#x27;s Old Campus. The college&#x27;s architecture is eclectic: though architect Otto Eggers completed most of the college with Georgian buildings, the college also incorporates two early-20th century buildings in the French Renaissance and Gothic Revival styles.

The College has links to Harvard&#x27;s Pforzheimer House and Dudley House, as well as Trinity College, Cambridge and Brasenose College, Oxford. Its rival college at Yale is Timothy Dwight College, located directly across Temple Street.

==History==

The oldest known settlement at the present-day site of the college was the farm of Robert Newman, whose barn hosted the meeting that incorporated the Colony of New Haven in 1639. The tract later became one of the blocks of New Haven&#x27;s original nine-square city plan. Yale&#x27;s first buildings on the site were for the Sheffield Scientific School. Byers Hall, a three-story building of Indiana limestone, was built in 1903 and designed by Hiss and Weekes architects in the modified French Renaissance Style. The Vanderbilt-Sheffield dormitory, a five-story building of the same material, was built between 1903 and 1906 by architect Charles C. Haight in the Gothic Revival style.
In 1936, the university demolished the block of university buildings and houses that stood at the site, retaining only Van-Sheff, Byers Hall, and the adjacent St. Anthony Hall society building. The New Haven home of Noah Webster, occupied by its namesake from 1822 to 1843, was one of the structures scheduled for demolition. During ensuing controversy over the home&#x27;s preservation, Henry Ford purchased the building and had it disassembled and re-erected at Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. A plaque now marks the site of the Webster House on the college&#x27;s northeast corner.
The &quot;Quadrangle Plan,&quot; primarily funded by Edward Harkness, opened nine residential colleges for Yale between 1933 and 1934. Eight colleges were intended for Yale College, and two further for the Scientific School, one of which would be funded by Frederick W. Vanderbilt. This tenth college was planned by 1931, when Charles Hyde Warren was appointed as a college master, and named for Benjamin Silliman in 1933. Warren, also Sterling Professor of Geology and Dean of the Sheffield Scientific School, wrote a biography of Silliman but only retained his appointment until 1938, two years before the college&#x27;s opening. Otto Eggers of Eggers &amp; Higgins, previously a draftsman for John Russell Pope&#x27;s buildings at Yale, was selected as the college&#x27;s architect. Eggers&#x27; design preserved Van Sheff, reconstructed the interior of Byers Hall, and created a quadrangle of Georgian buildings to complete the college and harmonize it with the adjacent Timothy Dwight College, established six years earlier.

When the college opened in 1940, philosopher F. S. C. Northrop was appointed its master.

Under the Yale College policy that let incoming students express a residential college preference, Silliman developed a reputation for attracting engineers until the policy ended with the class of 1958.

== Shield and mascot ==
Silliman College&#x27;s shield has a white background, three curving red lines emerging from near the bottom of the shield (representing salamander tails), and a green crossing bar containing three acorns. In heraldic terms, the shield is described as &quot;Arms: Argent, three piles wavy gules, on a fess vert three acorns or.&quot; The colors represent the four ancient elements: red for fire, white for air and water, and green for earth. The acorns are an element taken from the family arms of Frederick Vanderbilt, 1876, who funded the college&#x27;s construction.

The college&#x27;s mascot is the salamander. Students in the college refer to themselves as Sillimanders.

==Facilities==
The college courtyard, which covers almost an entire city block, is the largest enclosed courtyard at Yale and is one of the glories of the old college. Students can be seen playing various sports or lounging in the sun. Because of the size of the courtyard, sports such as spikeball, wiffle ball, football, and frisbee are often enjoyed.

Special facilities within Silliman include Yale&#x27;s only undergraduate art gallery, called Maya&#x27;s Room (named for Maya Tanaka Hanway, &#x27;83), a big-screen movie theater (Silliflicks), a dance studio, a half-court basketball facility called the Sillidome, computing facilities, a student kitchen, multiple music practice rooms, and a state-of-the-art sound recording studio. The college&#x27;s library, located in the third floor of Byers Hall, is commonly referred to as the Sillibrary. The Buttery, a student-run eatery in the basement that serves greasy goodness on weekday nights, is designed in the style of the 1950s and its surrounding area includes games such as ping pong, air hockey, and pool.


==Renovations==
In August 2007, after three years of on-and-off renovations, students moved back into Silliman College. Students now enjoy a reconfigured dining hall and servery, a stadium-seating movie theater, and a large student activities space that includes a new art gallery, dance studio, gym, basketball court, weight room, buttery, game room, and television entertainment space. The Silliman College courtyard was also restored to its former glory, with new patio spaces, benches, and grass. The renovation cost some $100 million, by far the most spent on any residential college renovation at Yale.

Because of the size of Silliman College, the renovation work on the college was completed in several phases instead of the 15-month renovation completed on other colleges:
* In the summer of 2004, the roof and windows were replaced on the brick section of the college. Extra dormers were also added to the roofs so that student rooms could later be installed in the former attic spaces.
* In the summer of 2005, the Silliman Tower underwent a complete interior renovation.
* The entire college was shut down during the 2006-2007 school year for the rest of the renovation. All students from the college moved into either Swing Space (a new dormitory built especially to house students during college renovations), the Elm Street Annex or into independent off-campus housing until the renovations were completed.
* In 2017, a coffee shop, The Acorn, was added into the fourth floor of Byers Hall.

==Activities and traditions==

===Intramural sports===
Silliman College has won the Tyng Cup (awarded for the best intramural record of Yale&#x27;s 14 residential colleges) eight times, in 1941, 1943, 1968, 1969, 1972, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

== Silliman fame ==
Silliman gained fame when the popular movie &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; featuring Julia Roberts, Julia Stiles and Kirsten Dunst, was partly filmed in the Silliman College courtyard and common room. The Grove Street facade of Silliman was used to represent Harvard University, and the Wall Street Gate and the common room were used to represent Wellesley College.

== Notable alumni==

<text>12-&quot;O&quot;-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), also commonly known as tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is a diester of phorbol. It is a potent tumor promoter often employed in biomedical research to activate the signal transduction enzyme protein kinase C (PKC). The effects of TPA on PKC result from its similarity to one of the natural activators of classic PKC isoforms, diacylglycerol. TPA is a small molecule drug.

In ROS biology, superoxide was identified as the major reactive oxygen species induced by TPA/PMA but not by ionomycin in mouse macrophages. Thus, TPA/PMA has been routinely used as an inducer for endogenous superoxide production.

TPA is also being studied as a drug in the treatment of hematologic cancer 

TPA has a specific use in cancer diagnostics as a B-cell specific mitogen in cytogenetic testing. Cells must be divided in a cytogenic test to view the chromosomes. TPA is used to stimulate division of B-cells during cytogenetic diagnosis of B-cell cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

TPA is also commonly used together with ionomycin to stimulate T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production, and is used in protocols for intracellular staining of these cytokines.

TPA induces KSHV reactivation in PEL cell cultures via stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. The pathway involves the activation of the early-immediate viral protein RTA that contributes to the activation of the lytic cycle.

TPA was first found in the Croton plant, a shrub found in Southeast Asia, exposure to which provokes a poison ivy-like rash. It underwent a phase 1 clinical trial.

<text>Timothy Dwight College, commonly abbreviated and referred to as &quot;TD&quot;, is a residential college at Yale University named after two presidents of Yale, Timothy Dwight IV and his grandson, Timothy Dwight V. The college was designed in 1935 by James Gamble Rogers in the Federal-style architecture popular during the elder Timothy Dwight&#x27;s presidency and was most recently renovated in 2002. In 2021, TD won its Yale-leading 14th Tyng Cup, the championship prize for Yale&#x27;s year-long intramural athletic competition among the fourteen residential colleges. The current Head of College is Michal Beth Dinkler and the current Dean is Sarah Mahurin.

==History==

Timothy Dwight College, Yale&#x27;s ninth residential college, opened on September 23, 1935 at an over-budget cost of $2,000,000. At the time, the Yale Alumni Weekly called it &quot;one of the most architecturally pleasing colleges.&quot; It was the farthest college from Old Campus until the opening in 2017 of Franklin and Murray colleges several blocks to the north. The design of the college was meant to reference an early 19th-century New England town hall, and the college&#x27;s brick work with white trim, green shutters, and hand-hewn dining hall beams are all of Federal inspiration. In the college&#x27;s inaugural year, a number of plaster ceilings collapsed in the college, leading the TD Social Activities Committee to sponsor a Plaster Dinner and Mr. Plaster dances, a tradition that continued until the 1970s.

Under the Yale College policy that let incoming students express a residential college preference, Timothy Dwight developed a reputation for attracting engineers until the policy ended with the class of 1958.

The students of Timothy Dwight were originally nicknamed &quot;Prexies,&quot; a slang term for the college&#x27;s presidential namesakes, but TD&#x27;s current mascot is the Lion. The college&#x27;s official motto, appearing on the college crest, is a quotation from the Aeneid (I, 203), when Aeneas seeks to comfort his men as they embark upon an arduous journey to Italy: &quot;Forsan et haec olim meminisse juvabit&quot;. This is traditionally translated approximately to, &quot;Someday, perhaps, it will be pleasant to remember even this.&quot;

The college&#x27;s popular but unofficial motto is &quot;Àshe,&quot; which means &quot;We make it happen&quot; in Yoruba. Àshe was brought into usage by the former Master, Robert Thompson, known to students as &quot;Master T.&quot;
The Timothy Dwight fight song, often sung &quot;en masse&quot; at The Game, is : &quot;Ring the bell, ring the bell! God damn, fuck, hell! Horseshit, assbite! Nobody&#x27;s better than Timothy Dwight!&quot;

Timothy Dwight has a sister college at Harvard called Leverett House. At the annual Harvard-Yale football game, students from Timothy Dwight and Leverett will host each other depending on the site of that year&#x27;s Game. Jeff Brenzel was appointed as the new master of Timothy Dwight College on April 25, 2010. Outgoing Master Robert F. Thompson welcomed Brenzel and his wife with a special rap:
“The man who picks who gets into Yale / Now joyfully follow, their TD trail&quot;.

==Student life==

Timothy Dwight is one of the four residential colleges at Yale whose freshmen live within the college rather than on Old Campus. The living arrangements plus the small size of the college foster a strong community within the college, and Timothy Dwight was recognized as &quot;The Most Spirited College&quot; in a Yale Daily News poll from 2010. Freshmen in the college are treated every September to a retreat at a residential fellow&#x27;s estate, complete with athletic fields and a pool. TD students also celebrate their residential college with an annual TD Weekend, comprising TD Day (affectionately referred to by TD students as TDDDTDD), where students enjoy a barbecue, music, and inflatable games on Friday, and the Timothy Dwight Crawfish Boil on Saturday. The college&#x27;s strong sense of spirit carries over into an annual high-budget tailgate, easily the most decadent and well-attended of all the university&#x27;s unofficial pregames, on the morning of the Yale-Harvard football game in November.

Sunday to Thursday nights, from 10pm to 1am, the buttery of Timothy Dwight college is open to all Yale undergraduate students and guests. Cleverly named the TD Butt, this student-run diner sells snacks and desserts, including quesadillas, cookie dough, popcorn chicken, and chocolate candy bars. The Timothy Dwight buttery is so acclaimed by the Yale College community that it has its own Yelp page.

Students in Timothy Dwight have excelled at intramural sports since the college&#x27;s founding in 1935. In 1937, TD captured its first of its 13 Tyng Cups, Yale&#x27;s intramural sports competition between the twelve residential colleges. TD has won the Tyng Cup more than any other college.

In the basement of the college, there are activity rooms to which students may gain swipe access; namely, the Selin Lounge, the art room, the music room, and the photography darkroom. The weight-lifting room and cardio rooms, as well as the student kitchen and games room, are open to all the students of the residential college.

Some Timothy Dwight students also choose to live in Rosenfeld Hall, located at 109 Grove Street. Often referred to as &quot;RH&quot; by TD students, the building is used as residential annex housing for TD upperclassmen and previously belonged to St. Elmo Society. The building also contains a classroom space which is open to most students at Yale.

==Coat of arms==
In heraldic language, the coat of arms may be described as &quot;Argent, a lion passant above a cross crosslet fitchy gules; in a chief gules a crescent silver&quot;. The arms were likely invented by Jacob Hurd, a Boston silversmith, who engraved them on a tankard which he made in 1725 for the grandparents of the elder Timothy Dwight.

<doc id="1300604" wikidata="Q33475" url="?curid=1300604" title="Gan Chinese">
<text>Gan, Gann or Kan is a group of Sinitic languages spoken natively by many people in the Jiangxi province of China, as well as significant populations in surrounding regions such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Fujian. Gan is a member of the Sinitic languages of the Sino-Tibetan language family, and Hakka is the closest Chinese variety to Gan in terms of phonetics.

There are different dialects of Gan; the Nanchang dialect is the prestige dialect.

==Classification==
Like all other varieties of Chinese, there is a large amount of mutual unintelligibility between Gan Chinese and other varieties. Within the variation of Chinese dialects, Gan has more similarities with Mandarin than with Yue or Min. However, Gan clusters more with Xiang than Mandarin.

Gan and other Southern Chinese languages can be distinguished from Northern Chinese by their placement of direct objects before indirect objects. Gan&#x27;s ditransitive verbs introduce the theme right after the verb, while Mandarin&#x27;s introduce the recipient. So the difference in tritransitive verbs may occur because they evolved from different types of ditransitive verbs. 

==Name==
* &quot;Gan&quot;: the most common name. Also spelled &quot;Gann&quot; to reflect the falling tone of the name in Mandarin. Scholars in mainland China use &quot;Gan&quot; or &quot;Gan dialect.&quot;
* &quot;Jiāngxīhuà&quot; (&quot;Jiangxi language&quot;) is commonly used in Chinese, but since the borders of the language do not follow the borders of the province, this name is not geographically exact.
* &quot;Xi&quot; (&quot;right-river language&quot;): an ancient name, now seldom used, arising from the fact that most Gan speakers live south of the Yangtze River, beyond the right-hand bank when traveling downstream.

==Region==
Most Gan speakers live in the middle and lower reaches of the Gan River, the drainage area of the Fu River, and the region of Poyang Lake. There are also many Gan speakers living in eastern Hunan, eastern Hubei, southern Anhui, northwest Fujian, etc.

According to the &quot;Diagram of Divisions in the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, Gan is spoken by approximately 48,000,000 people: 29,000,000 in Jiangxi, 4,500,000 in Anhui, 5,300,000 in Hubei, 9,000,000 in Hunan, and 270,000 in Fujian.

==History==

===Antiquity===
During the Qin dynasty (221 BC), a large number of troops were sent to southern China in order to conquer the Baiyue territories in Fujian and Guangdong, as a result, numerous Han Chinese emigrated to Jiangxi in the years following. In the early years of the Han dynasty (202 BC), Nanchang was established as the capital of the Yuzhang Commandery () (this name stems from the original name of Gan River), along with the 18 counties () of Jiangxi Province. The population of the Yuzhang Commandery increased from 350,000 (in AD 2) to 1,670,000 (by AD 140); it ranked fourth in population among the more than 100 contemporary commanderies of China. As the largest commandery of Yangzhou, Yuzhang accounted for two-fifths of the population and Gan gradually took shape during this period.

===Middle Ages===
As a result of continuous warfare in the region of central and Northern China, the first large-scale emigration in the history of China took place. Large numbers of people in central China relocated to southern China in order to escape the bloodshed caused by the upheaval of the Five Barbarians and at this time, Jiangxi played a role as a transfer station. Also, during this period, ancient Gan began to be exposed to the northern dialects. After centuries of rule by the Southern Dynasties, Gan still retained many original characteristics despite having absorbed some elements of northern speech. Up until the Tang dynasty, there was little difference between old Gan and the contemporary Gan of that era. Beginning in the Five Dynasties period, however, inhabitants in the central and northern parts of Jiangxi Province began to migrate to eastern Hunan, eastern Hubei, southern Anhui and northwest Fujian. During this period, following hundreds of years of migration, Gan spread to its current areas of distribution.

===Late traditional period===
Mandarin Chinese evolved into a standard language based on Beijing Mandarin, owing largely to political factors. At the same time, the differences between Gan and Mandarin continued to become more pronounced. However, because Jiangxi borders on Jianghuai, a Mandarin, Xiang, and Hakka speaking region, Gan proper has also been influenced by these surrounding varieties, especially in its border regions.

===Modern times===
After 1949, as a &quot;dialect&quot; in Mainland China, Gan faced a critical period. The impact of Mandarin is quite evident today as a result of official governmental language campaigns. Currently, many youths are unable to master Gan expressions, and some are no longer able to speak Gan at all.

Recently, however, as a result of increased interest in protecting the local language, Gan now has begun to appear in various regional media, and there are also newscasts and television programs broadcast in Gan Chinese.

==Languages and dialects==
There are significant differences within the Gan-speaking region, and Gan constitutes more languages than listed here. For example, in Anfu county, which was categorized as Ji-Cha, there are two main varieties, called Nanxiang Hua (Southern region) and Beixiang Hua (Northern region). People from one region cannot even understand people from the other region if they were not well educated or exposed to the other.
The &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot; (1987) divides Gan into nine groups:
Cities marked with * are partly Gan-speaking.

== Phonology ==
==Grammar==

In Gan, there are nine principal grammatical aspects or &quot;tenses&quot; – initial (), progressive (), experimental (), durative (), processive (), continuative (), repeating (), perfect (), and complete ().

The grammar of Gan is similar to southern Chinese varieties. The sequence subject–verb–object is most typical, but subject–object–verb or the passive voice (with the sequence object–subject–verb) is possible with particles. Take a simple sentence for example: &quot;I hold you&quot;. The words involved are: ngo (&quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot;), tsot dok (&quot;to hold&quot;), ň (&quot;you&quot;).
* Subject–verb–object (typical sequence): The sentence in the typical sequence would be: ngo tsot dok ň. (&quot;I hold you.&quot;)
* Subject–&quot;lat&quot;–object–verb: Another sentence of roughly equivalent meaning is ngo lat ň tsot dok, with the slight connotation of &quot;I take you and hold&quot; or &quot;I get to you and hold.&quot;
* Object–&quot;den&quot;–subject–verb (the passive voice): Then, ň den ngo tsot dok means the same thing but in the passive voice, with the connotation of &quot;You allow yourself to be held by me&quot; or &quot;You make yourself available for my holding.&quot;

==Vocabulary==

In Gan, there are a number of archaic words and expressions originally found in ancient Chinese, and which are now seldom or no longer used in Mandarin. For example, the noun &quot;clothes&quot; in Gan is &quot;衣裳&quot; while &quot;衣服&quot; in Mandarin, the verb &quot;sleep&quot; in Gan is &quot;睏覺&quot; while &quot;睡覺&quot; in Mandarin. Also, to describe something dirty, Gan speakers use &quot;下里巴人&quot;, which is a reference to a song from the Chu region dating to China&#x27;s Spring and Autumn period.

Additionally, there are numerous interjections in Gan (e.g. 哈, 噻, and 啵), which can largely strengthen sentences, and better express different feelings.

==Writing system==
Gan is written with Chinese characters, though it does not have a strong written tradition. There are also some romanization schemes, but none are widely used. When writing, Gan speakers usually use written vernacular Chinese, which is used by all Chinese speakers.

<doc id="1300606" wikidata="Q716921" url="?curid=1300606" title="Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester">
<text>Ranulf II (also known as Ranulf de Gernon), 4th Earl of Chester (1099–1153), was an Anglo-Norman baron who inherited the honour of the palatine county of Chester upon the death of his father Ranulf Meschin, 3rd Earl of Chester. He was descended from the Counts of Bessin in Normandy.

In 1136 David I of Scotland invaded England as far as Durham, which led Stephen of England to negotiate treaties that involved granting Ranulf&#x27;s lands around Carlisle to Scotland. Thereafter, Ranulf allied himself to Matilda to further his cause. He took Lincoln Castle in 1141, which was retaken by Stephen in a siege in which Ranulf was forced to flee for his life. Ranulf enlisted the help of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester to retake the castle and succeeded when King Stephen surrendered to him at Lincoln. While Matilda ruled England, Stephen&#x27;s queen Matilda of Boulogne managed to defeat Ranulf and his allies at Winchester, which eventually resulted in Stephen being able to resume the throne.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ranulf was born in Normandy at the Château Guernon, in 1099. He was the son of Ranulf Meschin, 3rd Earl of Chester and Lucy of Bolingbroke, who were both significant landowners with considerable autonomy within the county palatine. His father had begun a new lineage of the earldom of Chester. Ranulf married Maud, daughter of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester and inherited the earldom of Chester in 1128. Three years later he founded an abbey in North Wales, colonised by monks from the Norman Congregation of Savigny.

He and Maud had at least three children and possibly more:
* Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester (1147 – 30 June 1181), married Bertrade de Montfort of Évreux
* possibly Richard of Chester (died 1170/1175), buried in Coventry
* Beatrice of Chester, married Raoul de Malpas
* possibly Ranulf of Chester; fought in the siege of Lisbon; granted the lordship of Azambuja by Afonso I of Portugal
* Alice, married Richard FitzGilbert de Clare (1190–1136)

===Loss of northern lands to Scotland===

In late January 1136, during the first months of the reign of Stephen of England, his northern neighbour David I of Scotland crossed the border into England. He took Carlisle, Wark, Alnwick, Norham and Newcastle upon Tyne and struck towards Durham. On 5 February 1136, Stephen reached Durham with a large force of mercenaries from Flanders and forced David to negotiate a treaty by which the Scots were granted the towns of Carlisle and Doncaster, for the return of Wark, Alnwick, Norham and Newcastle.

Lost from England to Scotland along with Carlisle was much of Cumberland and the honour of Lancaster, lands that belonged to Earl Ranulf&#x27;s father and had been surrendered by agreement to Henry I of England in return for the Earldom of Chester. Ranulf claimed that his father had at that time been disinherited. When he heard of the concessions made to the Scottish King, Ranulf left Stephen&#x27;s court in a rage.

In the second Treaty of Durham (1139), Stephen was even more generous to David, granting the Earldom of Northumbria (Carlisle, Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire north of the Ribble) to his son, Prince Henry. Ranulf was prepared to revolt in order to win back his lordship of the north.

===Capture of Lincoln===
By this time Matilda, named as the future Queen by her father Henry I, had gathered enough strength to contest Stephen&#x27;s usurpation, supported by her husband Geoffrey of Anjou and her half-brother Robert of Gloucester. Prince Henry was to attend the English court that Michaelmas and Ranulf planned to overwhelm him on his return to Scotland. Stephen&#x27;s queen Matilda of Boulogne heard about the plot and persuaded Stephen to escort Henry back to Scotland. Ranulf then used subterfuge to seize Lincoln Castle. He and his half-brother William de Roumare sent their wives to visit the constable&#x27;s wife there and then arrived (dressed in ordinary clothes and escorted by three knights), apparently to fetch the ladies. They then seized the weapons in the castle, admitted their own men and ejected the royal garrison.

Stephen eventually made a pact with Ranulf and his half-brother and left Lincolnshire, returning to London before Christmas 1140, after making William de Roumare Earl of Lincoln and awarding Ranulf with administrative and military powers over Lincolnshire and the town and castle of Derby. The citizens of Lincoln sent Stephen a message complaining about the treatment they were receiving from Ranulf and asking the King to capture the brothers. The King immediately marched on Lincoln. One of his key pretexts was that according to the settlement, Lincoln Castle was to revert to royal ownership and that the half-brothers had reneged on this. He arrived on 6 January 1141 and found the place scantily garrisoned: the citizens of Lincoln admitted him into the city and he immediately laid siege to the castle, captured seventeen knights and began to batter down the garrison with his siege engines.

Ranulf managed to escape to his earldom, collect his Cheshire and Welsh retainers and appeal to his father-in-law Robert of Gloucester, whose daughter Maud was still besieged in Lincoln, possibly as a deliberate ploy to encourage her father&#x27;s assistance. In return for Robert&#x27;s aid, Ranulf agreed to promise fidelity to the Empress Matilda.
To Robert and the other supporters of the Empress, this was good news, as Ranulf was a major magnate. Robert swiftly raised an army and set out for Lincoln, joining forces with Ranulf on the way. Stephen held a council of war at which his advisors counselled that he leave a force and depart to safety, but Stephen disregarded the odds and decided to fight, but was obliged to surrender to Robert. Ranulf took advantage of disarray amongst the king&#x27;s followers and in the weeks after the fighting managed to take the Earl of Richmond&#x27;s northern castles and capture him when he tried to ambush Ranulf. Richmond was put in chains and tortured until he submitted to Ranulf and did him homage.

Stephen had been effectively deposed and Matilda ruled in his place. In September 1141, Robert of Gloucester and Matilda besieged Winchester. The queen responded quickly and rushed to Winchester with her own army, commanded by the professional soldier William of Ypres. The queen&#x27;s forces surrounded the army of the empress, commanded by Robert, who was captured as a result of deciding to fight his way out of the situation. The magnates following the empress were forced to flee or be taken captive. Earl Ranulf managed to escape and fled back to Chester. Later that year Robert was exchanged for Stephen, who resumed the throne.

===Defection to Stephen===
In 1144 Stephen attacked Ranulf again by laying siege to Lincoln Castle. He made preparations for a long siege but abandoned the attempt when eighty of his men were killed whilst working on a siege tower that fell and knocked them into a trench, suffocating them all.

In 1145 (or early 1146) Ranulf switched allegiance from the Empress Matilda to Stephen. Since 1141 King David had been allied to Matilda, so Ranulf could now take up his quarrel with David of Scotland regarding his northern lands. It is probable that Ranulf&#x27;s brother-in-law Phillip, (the son of Earl Robert), acted as an intermediary as Phillip had defected to the king. Ranulf came to Stephen at Stamford, repented his previous crimes and was restored to favour. He was allowed to retain Lincoln Castle until he could recover his Norman lands. Ranulf demonstrated his goodwill by helping Stephen to capture Bedford from Miles de Beauchamp and bringing 300 knights to the siege of Wallingford.

Stephen welcomed Ranulf&#x27;s support but some of the king&#x27;s supporters, (especially William de Clerfeith, Gilbert de Gant, Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond, William Peverel the Younger, William d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel and John, Count of Eu), did not. Many of the magnates were alarmed when it was discovered that Ranulf wanted the king to take part in a campaign against the Welsh. Ranulf&#x27;s opponents counselled the king that the earl might be planning treachery since he had offered no hostages or security and could easily be ambushed in Wales. Stephen contrived a quarrel with Ranulf at Northampton, provoked by an advisor who told the earl that the king would not assist him unless he restored all the property he had taken and rendered hostages. The earl refused these terms. He was accused of treason and was arrested and imprisoned in chains until his friends succeeded in coming to terms with the King on 28 August 1146. It was then agreed that the earl should be released, provided he surrendered all the royal lands and castles he had seized (Lincoln included), gave hostages and took a solemn oath not to resist the king in future.

Ranulf, arrested in contravention of the oath which the king had sworn to him at Stamford, revolted as soon as he regained his liberty and &quot;burst into a blind fury of rebellion, scarcely discriminating between friend or foe”. He came with his army to Lincoln to recover the city but failed to break into its north gate and his chief lieutenant was slain in the fighting. Ranulf also tried to recover the castle at Coventry, by building a counter castle. The King came with a relief force to Coventry and although wounded in the fighting, drove Ranulf off and seized his hostages, including his nephew Gilbert fitz Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford, whom Stephen refused to release unless Gilbert surrendered his own castles. Gilbert, while agreeing to the condition, revolted as soon as he was at liberty. This action pushed the Clares into a conflict from which they had previously remained aloof.

===Agreement with King David===
In May 1149 the young Henry FitzEmpress met the king of Scotland and Ranulf at Carlisle, where Ranulf resolved his territorial disputes with Scotland and an agreement was reached to attack York. Stephen hurried north with a large force and his opponents dispersed before they could reach the city. The southern portion of the honour of Lancaster (the land between the Ribble and the Mersey) was conceded to Ranulf, who in return resigned his claim on Carlisle. Hence the Angevin cause secured the loyalty of Ranulf.

Henry, whilst trying to escape south after the aborted attack on York, was forced to avoid the ambushes of Eustace, King Stephen&#x27;s son. Ranulf assisted Henry, creating a diversion by attacking Lincoln, thus drawing Stephen to Lincoln and allowing Henry to escape.

===Treaty with Robert, Earl of Leicester===
The Earl&#x27;s territory in Leicestershire and Warwickshire brought him face to face with Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, whose family (including his cousin Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick and his brother Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester) controlled a large part of the south Midlands. The two earls concluded an elaborate treaty between 1149 and 1153. The Bishops of Chester and Leicester were both entrusted with pledges that were to be surrendered if either party infringed the agreement.

===Death===
In 1153 Henry, by then Stephen&#x27;s accepted heir, granted Staffordshire to Ranulf. That year, whilst Ranulf was a guest at the house of William Peverel the Younger, his host attempted to kill him with poisoned wine. Three of his men who had drunk the wine died, while Ranulf suffered agonizing pain. A few months later Henry became king and exiled Peverel from England as punishment. Ranulf succumbed to the poison on 16 December 1153: his son Hugh inherited his lands as held in 1135 (when Stephen took the throne), while other honours bestowed upon Ranulf were revoked.

<text>Trumbull College is one of fourteen undergraduate residential colleges of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. The college is named for Jonathan Trumbull, governor of Connecticut from 1769 to 1784 and advisor and friend to General George Washington. A Harvard College graduate, Trumbull was the only colonial governor to support the American Revolution.

Opened in September 1933, Trumbull College is one of the eight Yale colleges designed by James Gamble Rogers and the only one funded by John W. Sterling. Its Collegiate Gothic buildings form the Sterling Quadrangle, which Rogers planned to harmonize with his adjacent Sterling Memorial Library.

==History==

Trumbull is one of the University&#x27;s nine original colleges. Unlike the other eight colleges, which were funded and endowed by Edward Harkness, funds for Trumbull came from university benefactor John W. Sterling. Yale originally planned to name the college after John C. Calhoun, a Yale graduate, U.S. vice president, and secessionist. In deference to Sterling being a Civil War veteran from Connecticut, the university agreed to name the college after Jonathan Trumbull and gave the name Calhoun to another residential college (now re-named Hopper College).

Before University President James Rowland Angell instituted the residential college system in 1931, the site that was to become Trumbull contained two free-standing dormitory buildings flanking the old gymnasium. James Gamble Rogers, architect of eight of Yale&#x27;s colleges, considered the dormitories to be his magnum opus and inscribed the initials of the men who worked on the project on shield carvings along the outside of the buildings. The buildings are modeled after King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

The gym was torn down and the dormitories connected with a new building in the Collegiate Gothic style. The new building contained the Trumbull dining hall, common room, and library. A new dorm wing was constructed parallel to the originals and a faculty member&#x27;s house (first known as the Master&#x27;s House and since April 2016 as the Head of College House) was added. With the Sterling Memorial Library to the north, the buildings formed the Sterling Quadrangle. The buildings split the quadrangle into three separate courtyards — Alvarez (Main) Court, Potty Court, and Stone Court.

Although the construction techniques were modern, Rogers went to lengths to make the buildings appear centuries old. He had workers distress stone walls with acid. They intentionally broke some of the leaded glass windows and then repaired them with extra leading in the medieval fashion. They created niches for statuary and left them empty, as if the statues had been lost or destroyed over time. They varied the carving techniques used on the exterior stone, to suggest to the practiced eye that the work had been done by different carvers over many years. 
 
Each residential college was to be headed by a senior faculty member serving as college master. The university chose the first masters to reflect a diverse range of disciplines. President Angell, a psychologist, was especially keen to have a scientist among them. He recruited Stanhope Bayne-Jones, a Yale College graduate and Dean of University of Rochester Medical School, to come to Yale as Trumbull&#x27;s first master.

Because Trumbull was pieced together using existing buildings, and on a small area of land, its original student rooms were older and amenities were less generous than those of some of its sister colleges. (The college has since been renovated and upgraded.) Still, the college&#x27;s first faculty and students put the space to some creative uses. For example, Clements Fry, pioneering psychiatrist in the Department of University Health, opened a counseling office in a fourth-floor room off Stone Court. Students found space to put on plays and publish a college magazine.

During World War II, Yale turned much of its campus over to the military for training. By 1943 Trumbull was one of only three colleges that continued to house undergraduates (Timothy Dwight and Jonathan Edwards were the others).

In the first two decades of Yale&#x27;s residential college system, students would apply for entry to their choice of college at the end of their freshman year. Although the university sought to give each college a diverse population, the colleges acquired reputations. Freshmen from wealthy families with social connections tended to shun Trumbull. As one chronicler of the university&#x27;s history noted, &quot;Calhoun and Davenport were strongly athletic and ‘white shoe,’ only engineers (it was whispered) congregated in Silliman and Timothy Dwight, and no one knew &quot;who&quot; lived in Trumbull.&quot; In other words, Trumbull maintained a reputation for housing serious students, many of whom were on scholarships. Some called Trumbull &quot;the bursar&#x27;s college.&quot; To overcome these social differences, the university began assigning most students to colleges randomly — beginning in 1954 at the end of the student&#x27;s freshman year, and beginning in 1962 upon admission to Yale.

In 1968, Yale President Kingman Brewster announced a plan for admitting women to Yale and proposed that Trumbull be turned into housing for freshman women. Brewster held a &quot;stormy&quot; meeting with Trumbull students, who would have been forced to vacate their college. In response to the protest, Brewster changed his plan and reserved one of the Old Campus dormitories for women. The Trumbull College Council passed a motion &quot;vigorously endorsing with rampant enthusiasm&quot; the revised proposal.

Helen Brown Nicholas, wife of former Trumbull Master John Spangler Nicholas, died in 1972 and left the college a bequest to fund building of a chapel. Yale architecture professor Herbert Newman and his students designed the chapel, modifying an existing squash court in the Trumbull basement. It was dedicated in 1974. Frequently used as a theater, &quot;Nick&quot; Chapel remains in high demand by Yale students of all colleges.

The college was extensively remodeled during the 2005–2006 academic year, thanks in part to donations from the Alvarez family. All dorm rooms and bathrooms were renovated, and the dining hall kitchen and the activity areas in the basement received comprehensive upgrades and modernization.
==Student life==

Trumbull freshmen are housed in Bingham Hall along with students from Grace Hopper College. The dormitory&#x27;s location on the southern corner of the Old Campus is site of the College House, Yale&#x27;s first building in New Haven, and Osborn Hall, demolished in 1926 for Bingham Hall&#x27;s construction. It is the only freshman dormitory with elevator access and contains a comparative literature library on its eighth story.

Trumbull College itself includes three courtyards, a buttery, dance studio, student kitchen, TV room, theatre, seminar room, art gallery, art studio, pottery studio, gym, music room, common room, computer rooms, library, dining hall, billiards and ping pong areas as well as a Head of College&#x27;s House where many social activities are held.

Trumbull is the smallest of Yale&#x27;s residential colleges, both in terms of students affiliated with the college and students housed in the college.

==Faculty leaders==
* Fahmeed Hyder, professor of biomedical engineering at the Yale School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science and professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at the Yale School of Medicine, was appointed to a five-year term as Head of College, beginning on July 1, 2023. Hyder&#x27;s wife, Anita Sharif-Hyder, Associate Secretary for the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, serves as Associate Head of College. 
* Surjit Chandhoke, lecturer and research scientist in the Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology Department, is Dean of Trumbull College, living in the college and tracking students&#x27; academic progress as well as joining in many social activities. Before coming to Trumbull, she had been a long-term advisor to biology students.
*Jorge Anaya (Assistant Director of Student Engagement at the Yale College Dean&#x27;s Office), and Nils Rudi and Teresa Chahine (both professors at the Yale School of Management) are residential fellows in the college and often join students in activities.

==College traditions==
* The phrase &quot;We must consult Brother Jonathan&quot; appears on the graduation certificates of the college.

* Cornhole is a game in which teams throw a series of four bean-bags across to the other team&#x27;s board, scoring 1 point for each that remains on the board, 3 points if it falls through a hole in the middle. After both teams have gone, the difference between their points is taken, and that difference is awarded to the winning team. Trumbull&#x27;s cornhole games appear during its Fall Rumble in Trumbull festival as well as in the spring during its Pamplona event.
* The Trumbulletin was Trumbull&#x27;s tabloid magazine and the oldest residential college publication at Yale. The tradition continues in a reduced electronic form as weekly dispatches from the head of college.
* Rumble in Trumbull: Trumbullians combat with massive foam gloves. Favorite past Rumbles include &quot;Jews vs. Gentiles&quot; and various competitions among suites. Good things to eat and many games appear during Rumble in Trumbull.
* Pamplona: Trumbullians celebrate the end of spring classes with food, music, competitions, and the Running of the Bulls.
* Running of the Bulls is a raucous run through Cross Campus and Trumbull&#x27;s traditional rival college, neighboring Berkeley. It usually occurs on the day of Pamplona.
* Trumbull seniors annually paint the Potty Court Statue before graduation. The class of 2008 painted the statue to look like then-Yale College Dean Peter Salovey (who went on to serve as Yale&#x27;s president from 2013 to 2024). The class of 2014 painted it to look like Harold, a golden retriever and former Trumdog who loved students.

==Past traditions==

* Potty Court Frisbee was a game popular in the 1970s and 1980s played in the Potty Court by two teams of two players each. The general idea was to stand on the low stone wall next to the wrought iron arch at one end of the courtyard and throw a frisbee through the twin arch at the other end, while the other team&#x27;s two players tried to stop it. Defenders could stand on and lean out from the low stone wall, and could hang from the arch, but could not touch the walkway under the arch. The throws alternated between the teams.

A throw that went through the arch above the level of the stone wall scored one point. A throw that went through one of the two narrow gaps at the top of the arch&#x27;s ironwork was a &quot;grundl&quot; and scored two points. To discourage defenders from committing to defense of the arch before the opponent threw, the thrower could also score a point for a shot that hit the wrought iron fencing next to the arch, but a &quot;fence shot&quot; had to hit the fence on the fly or off a wall, while a shot through the arch was allowed to bounce off the ground. The first team to get seven points won. Other than the frisbee, no equipment was required, although some players wore leather gloves to protect their hands from the wrought iron.
* The Beer and Bicycle Race was a team biathlon event from the 1950s and &#x27;60s, briefly revived in the &#x27;70s. The first race, in 1952, staged by the Trumbull Beer and Bike Society, was an over 70-mile relay from Trumbull to Vassar College. Riders had to consume a quart of beer before passing the baton to the next member of their team (although some sources suggest the beer had to be consumed before riding). Prizes were awarded for fastest times and best rider costumes. The annual April event became the center of press attention, partying, and celebration, and grew to the point that authorities at Vassar banned it in 1957. It continued for a while with a new destination, Connecticut College. In 1964, Trumbull ran it on a 45-mile course through nearby towns, ending back at the Yale Bowl. It seems to have faded away after that, although Trumbull re-staged it for a few years in the 1970s as a double round-trip race between Trumbull and Sleeping Giant State Park.
* The Trumbull Crier, during the 1990s, was a student who made announcements during dinner from the balcony of the college dining hall. The Crier would begin the announcements with, &quot;Moo-ye, Moo-ye, it&#x27;s six o&#x27;clock in Trumbull College, and all is well!&quot; The first Trumbull Crier was Jeremy Monthy (Class of 1995), who came up with the concept. He made and wore a tricorn hat fitted with bull horns.

<text>Tanespimycin (17-&quot;N&quot;-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, 17-AAG) is a derivative of the antibiotic geldanamycin that is being studied in the treatment of cancer, specifically in younger patients with certain types of leukemia or solid tumors, especially kidney tumors.

It works by inhibiting Hsp90, which is expressed in those tumors.

It belongs to the family of drugs called antitumor antibiotics.

==Clinical trials==

Bristol-Myers Squibb conducted Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. However, in 2010 the company halted development of tanespimycin, during late-stage clinical trials as a potential treatment for multiple myeloma. While no definitive explanation was given, it has been suggested that Bristol-Myers Squibb halted development over concerns of the financial feasibility of tanespimycin development given the 2014 expiry of the patent on this compound, and the relative expense of manufacture.

<doc id="1300615" wikidata="Q1187628" url="?curid=1300615" title="The Return of the Condor Heroes">
<text>The Return of the Condor Heroes, also called The Giant Eagle and Its Companion, is a wuxia novel by Jin Yong (Louis Cha). It is the second part of the &quot;Condor Trilogy&quot; and was preceded by &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; and followed by &quot;The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber&quot;. It was first serialised between 20 May 1959 and 5 July 1961 in the Hong Kong newspaper &quot;Ming Pao&quot;.

The story revolves around the protagonist, Yang Guo, and his lover and martial arts master, Xiaolongnü, in their adventures in the &quot;jianghu&quot; (also called the &quot;wulin&quot;, the community of martial artists), where love between master and apprentice is seen as taboo. Jin Yong revised the novel in 1970 and again in 2004. There are 40 chapters in the second and third revisions. Each chapter has a title composed of four Chinese characters. Most of the revisions are either clarifications or minor alterations of character motivations or names. The Chinese title of the novel approximately translates to &quot;The Magical Condor and its Hero Companion&quot;.

==Plot==
The protagonist, Yang Guo, is the orphaned son of Yang Kang, the antagonist in the previous novel. The couple Guo Jing and Huang Rong take care of Yang Guo for a short period of time before sending him to the Quanzhen School on Mount Zhongnan for better guidance in moral values and &quot;orthodox&quot; martial arts. In Quanzhen, Yang Guo is often picked on and bullied by his fellow students, and discriminated against by his master, Zhao Zhijing. Yang Guo flees from Quanzhen and ventures unknowingly into the nearby Tomb of the Living Dead, where the Ancient Tomb School is based. There, he meets Xiaolongnü, a mysterious maiden of unknown origin, and becomes her apprentice. They live together in the tomb for many years until Yang Guo grows up.

Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü develop romantic feelings for each other, but their romance is forbidden by the prevailing norms of the &quot;wulin&quot; (martial artists&#x27; community). Throughout the story, their love meets with several tests, such as the misunderstandings that threaten to tear them apart, and their encounter with Gongsun Zhi, whom Xiaolongnü almost marries at one point. Finally, after their reunion and marriage, Xiaolongnü leaves Yang Guo again, owing to her belief she cannot recover from a fatal poison and promises to meet him again 16 years later, to prevent him from committing suicide. While Yang Guo is wandering the &quot;wulin&quot; alone, he meets several formidable martial artists and a giant eagle, and improves his skills tremendously after learning from them. His adventures gradually mould him into a courageous hero and perhaps the most powerful martial artist of his time. Yang Guo serves his native land by helping the ethnic Han people of the Song Empire resist invaders from the Mongol Empire, killing Möngke Khan at the Battle of Xiangyang. At the end of the novel, he is reunited with Xiaolongnü and they leave to lead the rest of their lives in seclusion after receiving praises and blessings from the &quot;wulin&quot;.

==Characters==
==Adaptations==

===Films===
===Television===
===Comics===
Asiapac Books acquired the rights to produce an illustrated version of the novel in 1995. The 18 volume comic series was illustrated by Wee Tian Beng and translated by Jean Lim with Jin Yong&#x27;s approval. The lavishly illustrated series won the Prestigious Award in 1997 during the Asian Comics Conference held in South Korea. Notable deviations from the main story include funny strips that poke gentle fun at some of the story&#x27;s events, in line with conventions of the comic book medium. The series was repackaged in 2021 and Asiapac produced a new limited collector&#x27;s edition of the comic in both English and Chinese.

In 2002 ComicsOne published the first official English translation of &quot;Legendary Couple&quot;, a retelling of the novel. The comic series was illustrated by Wong Yuk-long while Jin Yong was credited as the writer.

===Video games===
In 1997, Softworld released a RPG based on the novel for DOS. The game is only available in Chinese and covers the first half of the novel to the point where Yang Guo meets the Condor. In 2000, Interserv International Inc. published another video game adaptation using a 3D engine. 

=== Music ===
Fu Tong Wong composed an 8-movement symphony &quot;Symphony: The Hero with Great Eagle&quot; based on the novel.

<text>The Indelible Murtceps were an Australian progressive rock and dance-pop band, which formed, as a side project of Spectrum, in October 1971. Sometimes referred to as the shortened name, Murtceps, they were &quot;a stripped-back version... [that] could play anywhere and often.&quot; They worked the more lucrative dance and pub rock circuit. Whereas Spectrum performed in a full concert setting, commonly at larger venues, like the T.F. Much Ballroom, and at rock festivals.

The Indelible Murtceps&#x27; debut single, &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, was issued in 1972, which peaked in the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 40. It appeared ahead of their studio album, &quot;Warts Up Your Nose&quot;(1973), in the following year, which made the top 20. Sometimes both groups shared a stage; both disbanded after a joint final gig at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 15 April 1973. The performance was included on a shared live double album, &quot;Terminal Buzz&quot; (1973), which appeared in December that year.

==History==

The Indelible Murtceps were formed in Melbourne in October 1971 by Mike Rudd as a side project for his main group, Spectrum, using the same roster for both bands. The line-up was Mike Rudd on lead guitar, lead vocals and harmonica, Lee Neale on keyboards, Bill Putt on bass guitar and Ray Arnott on drums. With the advent of pub rock Spectrum&#x27;s lengthy and complex material was precluding bookings on the lucrative local dance and pub circuit. Spectrum were performing in a full concert setting, using a large PA system and light show, sometimes augmented by a dance, performance troupe, The Tribe. They commonly appeared at larger venues, like the T.F. Much Ballroom, and at rock festivals.

Rudd created a performance set of simpler, dance-pop tunes, with a reduced stage set-up, for use by Indelible Murtceps, allowing Spectrum to continue its progressive course while supplementing members&#x27; incomes with the more frequent Murtceps gigs. The name &#x27;murtceps&#x27; is &#x27;spectrum&#x27; written backwards. According to music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, the Murtceps were &quot;a stripped-back version... [that] could play anywhere and often.&quot; Susan Moore of &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; recalled that Spectrum&#x27;s &quot;music was often regarded as &#x27;progressive&#x27; and more for listening purposes, which didn&#x27;t please dance audiences too much. So the band developed an alter ego which they called the Indelible Murtceps, who turned up when a dance band was required.&quot;

In January 1972 they appeared at the inaugural Sunbury Pop Festival, with Spectrum providing a separate set. Three live tracks by the Indelible Murtceps, &quot;We are Indelible&quot;, &quot;Be My Honey&quot; and &quot;But that&#x27;s Alright&quot;, were issued on a various artists live album of the concert, &quot;Sunbury&quot;. They were one of three bands featured on a short film, &quot;Australian Colour Diary, No.43: 3 Directions in Australian&quot; (1972), directed by Peter Weir, which provided &quot;a sample of three trends in recent Australian pop music&quot;.

During 1972 Murtceps recorded their debut album, &quot;Warts Up Your Nose&quot;, at Armstrong&#x27;s Studios with Howard Gable as producer; it was released on 20 January 1973. Most tracks have satirical, scatological and sexual themes. According to Duncan Kimball of &quot;Milesago&quot; website the centrepiece is Rudd&#x27;s epic 13-minute ode to marijuana, &quot;Some Good Advice&quot;. The album was packaged in a brown cardboard cover, intended to evoke the &quot;plain brown wrapper&quot; traditionally associated with pornographic publications. By May 1972 they had released their debut single, &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, which (like the song &quot;Rene&quot; by The Small Faces) was a light hearted ode to a prostitute. The single version was different from the album version. It peaked at No. 36 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 40.

In September 1972 keyboardist Lee Neale had a nervous breakdown and left, he was replaced by John Mills on keyboards. Neale left the music industry. The Indelible Murtceps released a second single, &quot;Indelible Shuffle&quot;, from the album in June. Ahead of the single, in March 1973, drummer Ray Arnott announced he was leaving both groups and Rudd decided they would play their final gig at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 15 April 1973. The performance appeared on the double live album, &quot;Terminal Buzz&quot; (December 1973), which was credited to both Indelible Murtceps and Spectrum. Rudd, Mills and Putt co-founded a new group, Ariel; while Arnott joined Mighty Kong.

<text>The Madison Mallards are a collegiate summer baseball team based in Madison, Wisconsin that plays in the Northwoods League. Warner Park on Madison&#x27;s Northside is the team&#x27;s home field.

==History==
The history of minor league baseball in Madison begins with the early success of the Madison Muskies. A Midwest League Oakland A&#x27;s affiliate, the Muskies were competitive and gained a healthy following in the years following their 1982 origins. By 1993 the crowds had declined and the Muskies became less profitable.

In 1994 the Muskies were replaced for a single season by the St Louis affiliate, Madison Hatters. 1996 began the five-year stint of the independent Madison Black Wolf, but once again low attendance and little interest plagued the team and they were forced to move to a more profitable community.

In 2001, area businessman Steve Schmitt introduced the Madison Mallards to Warner Park. The Mallards joined the Northwoods League, which features amateur college players playing summer ball during their off-season.

On October 17, 2019, the pro shop had significant damage done to it by a suspicious fire and the police investigated it as arson. There was an estimated $150,000 in damages.

=== Success ===
The Mallards made it to the playoffs in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2021, and 2024. They have made four Northwoods League Championship Series appearances, which resulted in runner-up finishes in 2005 and 2008. They won the Northwoods League championship in 2004 and 2013.

== Ownership ==
In 2014, the Mallards ownership group created Big Top Baseball. Big Top Baseball was a leader in summer collegiate baseball, operating four Northwoods League franchises in the state of Wisconsin at the time. Big Top Baseball owns and operates the Madison Mallards and Kenosha Kingfish and formerly owned the Wisconsin Rapids Rafters and Green Bay Bullfrogs, which were sold off during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Stadium==
Warner Park, built in 1982, currently seats 6,750 people.

=== Dimensions ===
The playing surface of the field is artificial turf infield with grass outfield, and the dimensions from home plate are 308 1/3 feet to left field, 380 feet to center field, and 290 2/3 feet to right field. The 440-square-foot scoreboard, installed in 2013, is located in left-center field. 14 flat-screen televisions can be found throughout the stadium. There is a children&#x27;s playground and picnic seating close to the foul lines in left field.

=== Attendance ===
The Mallards routinely lead the nation in attendance among collegiate summer baseball teams, averaging over 6,308 fans per game in 2017 and 6,249 in 2018. In 2024, the Mallards had over 200,000 in attendance throughout the season.

=== Duck Blind ===
The club offers a promotion called the Duck Blind, a group of seats in right field that cost up to $41 and include unlimited food, soda, and beer. In 2018, the Duck Blind underwent a $1 million renovation.

==Alternate monikers==
The Madison Mallards have adopted numerous Identities over the years. Here are the ones they currently use.

===Madison Muskallards===
The &quot;Muskallards&quot; nickname is inspired by the myth of Bozho, who, according to the Madison Mallards, a Loch Ness-type monster located in Lake Mendota. The Muskallards logo is the same as the Mallards &quot;M&quot; logo, but instead of a Mallard tail, it now has the tail of a Muskie (hence the name &quot;Muskallards&quot;, which is a combo of Muskies and Mallards). The colors of this rebrand consist of dark green, orange, and creme white.

===Madison Old Fashioneds===
The &quot;Old Fashioneds&quot; name is based of the Mallards attempt to build the World’s Largest Brandy Old Fashioned Cocktail, which is part of their Wisconsin Day Celebration. The team decided to honor this by rebranding as the Old Fashioneds for Wisconsin Day. The logo consists of a cherry swinging a wooden bat. The colors are red and brown.

===Madison Motivational Speakers===
The &quot;Motivational Speakers&quot; nickname pays homage to Chris Farley, a Madison native who starred in the SNL &quot;Van down by the river&quot; skit. The logo consists of Chris Farley&#x27;s character(Matt Foley) in a semi bent down pose with his right hand pointing to the right. He is also wearing his classic look in that logo. The Jersey consists of the classic look as well (white and blue plad overshirt, white polo undershirt and a green tie).

<doc id="1300629" wikidata="Q1098467" url="?curid=1300629" title="Regional Italian">
<text>Regional Italian (, ) is any regional variety of the Italian language.

Such vernacular varieties and standard Italian exist along a sociolect continuum, and are not to be confused with the local non-immigrant languages of Italy that predate the national tongue or any regional variety thereof. Among these languages, the various Tuscan, Corsican and some Central Italian lects are, to some extent, the closest ones to standard Italian in terms of linguistic features, since the latter is based on a somewhat polished form of Florentine.

The various forms of Regional Italian have phonological, morphological, syntactic, prosodic and lexical features which originate from the underlying substrate of the original language of the locale.

== Regional Italian and the languages of Italy ==
The difference between Regional Italian and the actual languages of Italy, often imprecisely referred to as dialects, is exemplified by the following: in Venetian, the language spoken in Veneto, &quot;we are arriving&quot; would be translated into , which is quite distinct from the Standard Italian . In the regional Italian of Veneto, the same expression would be &quot;stémo rivando&quot; or &quot;siamo dietro ad arrivare&quot;. The same relationship holds throughout the rest of Italy: the local version of standard Italian is usually influenced by the underlying local language, which can be very different from Italian with regard to phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary. Anyone who knows Standard Italian well can usually understand Regional Italian quite well, while not managing to grasp the regional languages.

== Origin ==
Many contemporary Italian regions already had different substrates before the conquest of Italy and the islands by the ancient Romans: Northern Italy had a Ligurian, Venetic, Rhaetic and Celtic substrate in the areas once known as Cisalpine Gaul (&quot;Gaul on this side of the Alps&quot;); Central Italy had an Umbrian and Etruscan substrate; Southern Italy and Sicily had an Oscan and Italic-Greek substrate respectively; and finally, Sardinia had an indigenous (Nuragic) and Punic substrate. These languages in their respective territories contributed in creolising Latin, the official language of the Roman Empire.

Even though the Sicilian School, using the Sicilian language, had been prominent earlier, by the 14th century the Tuscan dialect of Florence had gained prestige once Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) and Giovanni Boccaccio all wrote major works in it: the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the and the &quot;Decameron&quot;. Italian, defined as such, began to spread and be used as a literary and prestigious means of expression across the whole peninsula, Sicily and Corsica in the late Middle Ages; on the other hand, it would be introduced to Sardinia by a specific order only in the second half of the 18th century (1760), when the island&#x27;s ownership passed over to the House of Savoy. It was up to Pietro Bembo, a Venetian, to identify Florentine as &quot;the&quot; language for the peninsula in the (1525), in which he set up Petrarch as the perfect model. Italian, however, was a literary language and so was a written rather than spoken language, except in Tuscany and Corsica.

The popular diffusion of a unified Italian language was the main goal of Alessandro Manzoni, who advocated for a single national language mainly derived from &quot;cultured&quot; Florentine language. Having lived in Paris for many years, Manzoni had noticed that French (defined as the capital&#x27;s dialect) was a very lively language, spoken by ordinary people in the city&#x27;s streets. On the other hand, the only Italian city where even the commoners spoke something similar to literary Italian was Florence, so he thought that Italians should choose Florentine as the basis for the national language.

The Italian Peninsula&#x27;s history of fragmentation and colonization by foreign powers (especially France, Spain and the Austrian Empire) between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and its unification in 1861 played a considerable role in further jeopardizing the linguistic situation. When the unification process took place, the newly founded country used Italian mainly as a literary language. Many Romance and non-Romance regional languages were spoken throughout the Italian Peninsula and the islands, each with their own local dialects.

Italian as a spoken language was born in two &quot;linguistic labs&quot; consisting of the metropolitan areas in Milan and Rome, which functioned as magnets for internal migration. Immigrants were only left with the national language as a lingua franca to communicate with both the locals and other immigrants. After unification, Italian started to be taught at primary schools and its use by ordinary people increased considerably, along with mass literacy. The regional varieties of Italian, as a product of standard Italian mixing with the regional languages, were also born.

The various regional languages would be retained by the population as their normal means of expression until the 1950s, when breakthroughs in literacy and the advent of TV broadcasting made Italian become more and more widespread, usually in its regional varieties.

== Characteristics of regional Italian ==

Establishing precise boundaries is very difficult in linguistics, and this operation at the limit can be accomplished for individual phenomena (such as the realization of a sound), but not for all of them: it is necessary to proceed in part by abstractions. In general, an isogloss is an imaginary line that marks the boundary of a linguistic phenomenon. The line traditionally referred to as La Spezia-Rimini (though it is currently moving to the Massa-Senigallia line) is an important isogloss for Southern Europe, which delimits a continuum of languages and dialects characterized by similar phenomena that differ from others for these same phenomena.

This imaginary line is used here to define not only a boundary between dialect groups, but also between Northern regional Italian on the one hand and Central and Southern regional Italian on the other. Other well-defined areas are the Tuscan, the Extreme Southern Italian (comprising the peninsular part of Calabria, Salento and Sicily), and finally the Sardinian ones.

Based on borders like La Spezia-Rimini, here are the most well-identified groups of regional Italian.

=== Northern Italy ===
Northern regional Italian is characterized by a different distribution of the open and closed &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; () compared to the Florentine model, particularly evident in Milan, where the open &quot;e&quot; is pronounced at the end of the word (&quot;perché&quot; ) or in the word body in closed syllable (i.e. followed by consonant: &quot;stesso&quot; ) and the closed &quot;e&quot; in word body in open syllable (i.e. not followed by consonant: &quot;bene&quot; ). Except for the extreme Ligurian Levante, in Liguria, and especially in the capital, there is the opposite phenomenon: there is a tendency to close all the &quot;e&quot; even where the Italian standard does not envisage it. In Genoa and Bologna for example the names &quot;Mattèo&quot;, &quot;Irène&quot;, &quot;Emanuèle&quot; and the name of the city itself are pronounced with the closed &quot;e&quot;; moreover, there is no difference in the pronunciation of the word &quot;pesca&quot; either to mean &quot;peach&quot; (standard ) and &quot;fishing&quot; (standard ), both pronounced .

There is also a strong tendency to pronounce all the e&#x27;s before a nasal consonant as closed (usually when the nasal consonant is in the same syllable of the e) so that /ɛ/ becomes /e/. Sempre (always) is pronounced as in Northern Italy while the standard pronunciation is , The only exceptions being the words that end in -enne and -emme
A characteristic of the North in opposition to the South is the almost always voiced () consonant in intervocalic position, whereas in the south it is always voiceless: vs. . Also in opposition to the south, the north is characterized by the reduction of phonosyntactic doubling at the beginning of the word (after vowels) and the almost total abandonment of the preterite tense in verb forms as it is not present in the majority of Gallo-italic languages (they are replaced by the present perfect).

Sometimes, for older speakers, northern varieties lack geminated consonants (see gemination), especially in Veneto. The lack of the gemination standardly found in combinations of prepositions + articles (e.g. alla, dello, sull&#x27; etc.) is very widespread in casual speech, resulting in &quot;sull&#x27;albero&quot; sounding like in contrast with the standard pronunciation .

The consonants /ʃ, tʃ, dʒ/ are labialized in standard Italian ([ʃʷ, tʃʷ, dʒʷ]), but in northern varieties they&#x27;re not.

Final N&#x27;s (even though they&#x27;re not usually found in words with an Italian origin) are usually pronounced as velars in northern varieties, so the typical Venetian surname &quot;Martin&quot; is pronounced as in Northern Italy but in Central and Southern Italy.

In some cases, certain unstressed vowels may be pronounced more subtly or reduced in Northern Italian varieties compared to standard Italian. One example is the pronunciation of the suffix -ano for conjugating a first conjugation verb (-are) to a third plural person (they), which most of the times is phonetically realized as 

Widespread use of determiners before feminine names (&quot;la Giulia&quot;) is also noted in almost all the north while the determiner coupled with male names (&quot;il Carlo&quot;) is typical of the Po Valley.

In the northern vocabulary words like &quot;anguria&quot; (also common in Sardinia and Sicily), which means &quot;watermelon&quot;, instead of &quot;cocomero&quot;, &quot;bologna&quot; for &quot;mortadella&quot; (but not everywhere), &quot;piuttosto che&quot; (&quot;rather than&quot;) in the sense of &quot;or&quot; and not &quot;instead&quot;, etc. are in use. The last, in particular, is a custom that has begun to spread also in other areas of Italy, stirring up linguistic concern, as it is used with a semantic sense in contrast to that of standard Italian.

=== Tuscany ===
In Tuscany and especially in Florence, the Tuscan gorgia is very well known. That is, the lenition of the occlusive consonants in the post-vocalic position, including at the beginning of the word if the previous word ends up by vowel: &quot;la casa&quot; &quot;the house&quot; , even to its total disappearance. Also phonological in nature are forms without the diphthong &quot;uo&quot; of Standard Italian (&quot;ova&quot;, &quot;scola&quot;, &quot;bona&quot;, &quot;foco&quot; instead of &quot;uova&quot;, &quot;scuola&quot;, &quot;buona&quot;, &quot;fuoco&quot;), while in the syntax a tripartite system of demonstrative adjectives is in use: &quot;questo&quot; (&quot;this&quot;) to indicate something close to the speaker (first person), &quot;codesto&quot; (lost in other varieties) for something close to the contact person (second person), or &quot;quello&quot; &quot;that&quot; for something far from both (third person). A Tuscan stereotype is use of forms resembling the impersonal for the first person plural: &quot;(noi) si va&quot; instead of &quot;noi andiamo&quot; (&quot;we are going&quot;), past tense &quot;(noi) si è andati&quot;, and use of &quot;te&quot; rather than &quot;tu&quot; as second person singular subject pronoun: &quot;Te che fai stasera?&quot; rather than &quot;Tu che fai stasera?&quot; (&quot;What are you doing tonight?&quot;). Also typical of several areas including Tuscany is the use of the article before a female given name (&quot;la Elena&quot;, &quot;la Giulia&quot;); such use passed from Tuscany to other regions when used before the surname of well-known people, particularly of the past (&quot;il Manzoni&quot;). In the vocabulary there is the use of &quot;spenge&quot; instead of &quot;spegne&quot; (&quot;extinguishes&quot;) or words like &quot;balocco&quot; instead of &quot;giocattolo&quot; (&quot;toy&quot;), &quot;busse&quot; instead of &quot;percosse&quot; or &quot;botte&quot; (&quot;beatings&quot;), &quot;rena&quot; instead of &quot;sabbia&quot; (&quot;sand&quot;), &quot;cencio&quot; instead of &quot;panno&quot; (&quot;cloth&quot;).

The Tuscan historical dialects (including Corsican) belong to the same linguistic system as Italian, with few substantial morphological, syntactic or lexical differences compared to the standard language. As a result, unlike further from Tuscany in Italy, there are no major obstacles to mutual intelligibility of the local Romance languages and Regional Italian.

=== Central Italy, Southern Italy and Sicily ===
Central and Southern regional Italian is characterized by the usage of the affricate consonants in place of fricatives after nasal consonants (&quot;insolito&quot; instead of ), and by the doubling of the &quot;g&quot;&#x27;s and &quot;b&quot;&#x27;s (&quot;abile&quot; instead of , &quot;regina&quot; instead of ). A popular trait in the everyday southern speech is the usage of the apocope of the final syllable of the words, (&quot;ma&#x27;&quot; for &quot;mamma&quot; &quot;mom&quot;, &quot;professo&#x27;&quot; for &quot;professore&quot; &quot;professor&quot;, &quot;compa&#x27;&quot; for &quot;compare&quot; &quot;buddy, homie&quot; etc.).

In continental Southern Italy there is a different distribution of closed and open vowels (The pronunciation &quot;giòrno&quot; with an open &quot;o&quot; is very widespread in Campania for example), while in Calabria, Salento and Sicily closed vowels are completely missing and speakers just pronounce open vowels (), while in the other regions the discrepancies with the pronunciation Standards are minor (albeit relevant) and non-homogeneous; on the Adriatic side is more evident, as in certain areas of central-east Abruzzo (Chieti-Sulmona), largely in central-northern Apulia (Foggia-Bari-Taranto), and in eastern Basilicata (Matera) where it is present The so-called &quot;syllabic isocronism&quot;: free syllable vowels are all pronounced closed and those in close syllables all open (see the well-known example &quot;un póco di pòllo&quot; instead of &quot;un pòco di póllo&quot; &quot;a bit of chicken&quot;); Even in the Teramo area (northern Abruzzo), and up to Pescara, the vowels are pronounced with a single open sound (for example &quot;dove volete andare stasera?&quot; , Thus showing an inexplicable coincidence with the phonetic outcomes of Sicily and Calabria, although there is no direct link with them. As already mentioned here, the intervocalic s is always voiceless, and the use of the preterite is also frequent instead of the use of the present perfect. In continental southern Italy, from Rome down to Calabria, possessive pronouns often are placed after the noun: for example &quot;il libro mio&quot; instead of &quot;il mio libro&quot; (&quot;my book&quot;).

Another characteristic of regional Italian varieties in central and southern Italy is deaffrication of /tʃ/ between vowels, both word-internally and across word boundaries. In almost all peninsular Italy from Tuscany to Sicily &quot;luce&quot; is pronounced rather than , &quot;la cena&quot; is pronounced instead of as it is pronounced in northern Italy and in standard Italian.

===Sardinia===
Based on the significant linguistic distance between the Sardinian language (and any other traditionally spoken by the islanders) and Italian, the Sardinian-influenced Italian emerging from the contact between such languages is to be considered an ethnolect and sociolect of its own, as features divergent from Italian are local in origin, not attributable to more widespread Northern or Southern Italian varieties. While Sardinian phonetics and the introduction of Sardinian words in a full Italian conversation are prevalent, especially if they are Italianised in the process (e.g. &quot;blind&quot; and &quot;scimpru&quot; &quot;dumb&quot; becoming &quot;ciurpo&quot; and &quot;scimpro&quot;), the regional Sardinian variety of Italian embracing the most diverging syntactic and morphological changes is situated at the low end of the diastratic spectrum, and its usage, though relatively common among the less educated, is not positively valued by either bilingual Sardinian speakers, who regard it as neither Sardinian nor Italian and nickname it &quot;italianu porcheddìnu&quot; (&quot;piggy Italian&quot;, standing for &quot;broken Italian&quot;), or Italian monolinguals from Sardinia and other parts of the country.

Sardinianised Italian is marked by the prevalence, even in common speech, of the verb&#x27;s inversion, following rules of Sardinian (and Latin) but not Italian, which uses a subject-verb-object structure. The (often auxiliary) verb usually ends up at the end of the sentence, especially in exclamatory and interrogative sentences (e.g. &quot;Uscendo stai?&quot;, literally &quot;Going out are you?&quot;, from the Sardinian &quot;Essinde ses?&quot;, instead of &quot;Stai uscendo?&quot;; &quot;Studiando stavo!&quot; &quot;Been studying have I!&quot;, from &quot;Istudiende fia!&quot;, instead of &quot;Stavo studiando!&quot;; &quot;Legna vi serve?&quot; &quot;In need of some wood are you?&quot; from &quot;Linna bos serbit?&quot;, instead of &quot;Avete bisogno di un po&#x27; di legna?&quot;). It is also common for interrogative sentences to use a pleonastic &quot;tutto&quot; &quot;all&quot;, from the Sardinian &quot;totu&quot;, as in &quot;Cosa tutto hai visto?&quot; &quot;What all have you seen?&quot; from &quot;Ite totu as bidu?&quot; compared with the standard Italian &quot;Cosa hai visto?&quot;. The present continuous makes use of the verb &quot;essere&quot; &quot;to be&quot; as in English rather than &quot;stare&quot; (e.g. &quot;Sempre andando e venendo è!&quot; &quot;Always walking up and down she/he is!&quot; from &quot;Semper/Sempri andande e beninde est!&quot; compared with the standard Italian &quot;Sta sempre andando e venendo!&quot;): that is because the present continuous built with verb &quot;stare&quot; does not, in such regional variety, express the idea of an action ongoing at a certain point, but rather something that will take place in the very near future, almost on the point of happening (e.g. &quot;Sto andando a scuola&quot; with the meaning of &quot;I&#x27;m about to go to school&quot; rather than &quot;Right now as we speak, I&#x27;m going to school&quot;). It is also common to use antiphrastic formulas which are alien to Italian, by means of the particle &quot;già&quot; (Sard. &quot;jai&quot; / &quot;giai&quot;) which is similar to the German use of &quot;ja... schon&quot; especially for ironic purposes, in order to convey sardonic remarks (e.g. &quot;Già sei tutto studiato, tu!&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re so well educated!&quot; from &quot;Jai ses totu istudiatu, tue!&quot; which roughly stands for &quot;You are so ignorant and full of yourself!&quot;, or &quot;Già è poco bello!&quot; &quot;He/It is not so beautiful!&quot; from &quot;Jai est pacu bellu!&quot; meaning actually &quot;He/It is so beautiful!&quot;). One also needs to take into consideration the presence of a number of other Sardinian-specific idiomatic phrases being literally translated into Italian (like &quot;Cosa sembra?&quot; &quot;What does it look like?&quot; from &quot;Ite paret?&quot; meaning &quot;How do you do?&quot; compared to the standard Italian &quot;Come stai?&quot;, &quot;Mi dice sempre cosa!&quot; &quot;She/He&#x27;s always scolding me!&quot; from the Sardinian &quot;Semper cosa mi narat!&quot; compared to the standard Italian &quot;Mi rimprovera sempre!&quot;, or again &quot;Non fa!&quot; &quot;No chance!&quot; from &quot;Non fachet!&quot; / &quot;Non fait!&quot; compared to standard Italian &quot;Non si può!&quot;), that would make little sense to an Italian speaker from another region.

As mentioned earlier, a significant number of Sardinian and other local loanwords (be they Italianised or not) are also present in regional varieties of Italian (e.g. &quot;porcetto&quot; from the Sardinian &quot;porcheddu&quot; / &quot;porceddu&quot;, &quot;scacciacqua&quot; from the Sardinian &quot;parabba&quot; / &quot;paracua&quot; &quot;raincoat&quot;, &quot;continente&quot; &quot;Mainland&quot; and &quot;continentale&quot; &quot;Mainlander&quot; with reference to the rest of the country and its people as well, etc.).

Some words may even reflect ignorance of the original language on the speaker&#x27;s part when referring to a singular noun in Italian with Sardinian plurals, due to a lack of understanding of how singular and plurals nouns are formed in Sardinian: common mistakes are &quot;una seadas&quot;, &quot;un tenores&quot;, etc.

Regarding phonology, the regional Italian spoken in Sardinia follows the same five-vowel system of the Sardinian language without length differentiation, rather than the standard Italian seven-vowel system. Metaphony has also been observed: tonic &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; () have a closed sound whenever they are followed by a closed vowel (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;), and they have it open if they are followed by an open one (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot;). Hypercorrection is also common when applying the Italian rule of syntactic gemination; intervocalic &quot;t&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;c&quot; are usually elongated. Intervocalic voicing is the same as in Northern Italy, that is .

<text>2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME2, 2-MeO-E2) is a natural metabolite of estradiol and 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2). It is specifically the 2-methyl ether of 2-hydroxyestradiol. 2-Methoxyestradiol prevents the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need in order to grow (angiogenesis), hence it is an angiogenesis inhibitor. It also acts as a vasodilator and induces apoptosis in some cancer cell lines. 2-Methoxyestradiol is derived from estradiol, although it interacts poorly with the estrogen receptors (2,000-fold lower activational potency relative to estradiol). However, it retains activity as a high-affinity agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (10 nM, relative to 3–6 nM for estradiol).

==Clinical development==
2-Methoxyestradiol was being developed as an experimental drug candidate with the tentative brand name Panzem. It has undergone Phase 1 clinical trials against breast cancer. A phase II trial of 18 advanced ovarian cancer patients reported encouraging results in October 2007.

Preclinical models also suggest that 2-methoxyestradiol could also be effective against inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Several studies have been conducted showing 2-methoxyestradiol is a microtubule inhibitor and is inhibitory against prostate cancer in rodents.

, all clinical development of 2-methoxyestradiol has been suspended or discontinued. This is significantly due to the very poor oral bioavailability of the molecule and also due to its extensive metabolism. Analogues have been developed in an attempt to overcome these problems. An example is 2-methoxyestradiol disulfamate (STX-140), the C3 and C17β disulfamate ester of 2-methoxyestradiol.

==Clinical effects==
2-Methoxyestradiol was found to increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in men by 2.5-fold at a dose of 400 mg/day and by 4-fold at a dose of 1,200 mg/day. Conversely, it did not seem to suppress testosterone levels.

<doc id="1300635" wikidata="Q6273029" url="?curid=1300635" title="Jonathan Edwards College">
<text>Jonathan Edwards College (informally JE) is a residential college at Yale University. It is named for theologian and minister Jonathan Edwards, a 1720 graduate of Yale College. JE&#x27;s residential quadrangle was the first to be completed in Yale&#x27;s residential college system, and was opened to undergraduates in 1933.

Among James Gamble Rogers&#x27; original eight residential colleges, it is distinct in incorporating pre-existing buildings. Since its renovation in 2008, the college houses 212 students and several faculty fellows. In total, it has around 425 affiliated students and 250 affiliated fellows.

==History==
In 1930, Yale President James Rowland Angell announced a &quot;Quadrangle Plan&quot; for Yale College, establishing small collegiate communities in the style of Oxford and Cambridge in order to foster more social intimacy among students and faculty, relieve dormitory overcrowding, and reduce the influence of on-campus fraternities and societies. Professor Robert Dudley French was one of the earliest advocates of this plan and visited Oxford and Cambridge to study aspects of their college systems. In 1930, Angell appointed him Master of Jonathan Edwards College, the first such appointment at Yale.

JE&#x27;s early years saw a flourishing of political activity among students. In 1934 the Yale Political Union was founded in the college.

During World War II, JE was one of three residential colleges which remained open to civilian students. During this time, it became a significant site of intelligence community activity. Master French, who remained at the college through 1953, and his successor, William Dunham, were conduits for undergraduate recruitment into intelligence positions. Fellow and future dean Joseph Curtiss was extensively involved in CIA reconnaissance projects, including one known as the &quot;Yale Library Project.&quot;

Until the university abolished the practice 1962 and placed students in the colleges by lottery, the college admitted students by application after completion of their freshman year. During the 1960s, Master Beekman Cannon deepened a tradition of performing arts in the college, hosting operas, plays, recitals, and musical satire.

==Namesake==
Jonathan Edwards matriculated at Yale College in 1716 near his 13th birthday. Four years later, he graduated as valedictorian of his class of about twenty. This was at a time when entrance into either Harvard or Yale required ability in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. Edwards received his Masters of Arts from Yale in 1722. In 1724, he returned to the college as a tutor respected for his theological orthodoxy, anti-Arminianism, and devotion to Yale.

==Buildings==

=== Design ===
The dominant architectural style of JE is Gothic Revival, and the campus consists of two- to four-story buildings surrounding an open courtyard. It is the only one of James Gamble Rogers&#x27; eight colleges to blend new and pre-existing buildings. Less ornate than the adjacent Memorial Quadrangle, JE became the template for Yale&#x27;s gothic residential projects. 

Some of JE&#x27;s residential buildings are older than the colleage itself. The York-Library dormitory, completed in 1924, is a short, L-shaped building meant to complete the Gothic corridor along Library Street (now Library Walk). When Yale announced its college plan in 1928, Rogers reconfigured and expanded the York-Library dormitory, renaming its wings as Dickinson Hall and Wheelock Hall after early alumni who were the founding presidents of Princeton and Dartmouth. 

Constructing the rest of JE required the demolition of Kent Chemical Laboratory, replaced with Kent Hall on High Street. A dining hall and Head&#x27;s house were also added, creating the enclosed courtyard that Rogers wanted for each college under his &quot;quadrangle plan.&quot; 
JE&#x27;s last addition, added in 1965, is also the college&#x27;s oldest building. The construction of Weir Hall began in 1911 when George Douglas Miller decided to build a dormitory for Skull and Bones, an independent &quot;senior society&quot; for Yale students. Miller salvaged the castellated from Alumni Hall, a building on Old Campus originally constructed in 1851. The new Skull and Bones dormitory was never completed and was purchased by the university in 1912. Weir Hall hosted Yale&#x27;s Department of Architecture from 1924 until 1965. When the school was given a new building, Weir was converted to a dormitory and library building for JE.

===Expansion and renovation===

Though the basic architectural program of the college has remained unchanged since its opening, JE has undergone several significant renovations. In 1965, the annexation of Weir Hall allowed for the construction of the Robert Taft Library, faculty offices, and college seminar rooms, expanding the limited library space available in the original college.

In 2007, as part of a twelve-year program to renovate all of Yale&#x27;s residential colleges, Newman Architects led a major, yearlong renovation of JE. The renovation aimed to improve connectivity and accessibility, upgrade building systems, and restore and enhance building facilities. Most residential suites were reconfigured, administrative offices were consolidated, and the college was retrofitted with elevators and lower-level staircases. Residences for upperclassmen and graduate affiliates were added to Weir Hall, completing JE&#x27;s multi-decade annexation of the building. After several months of delays due to the complexity of the renovation, the college was rededicated in December 2008 in a ceremony commemorating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the residential college system.

=== Facilities ===

The freshman class lives in Farnam Hall on the Old Campus, and approximately half of the junior class lives in McClellan Hall. Due to the small size of the college and the proximity of McClellan, more upperclassmen live in annex housing than any other college (this isn&#x27;t a good thing). 

The Great Hall, the Rogers-designed dining hall in JE, is in the style of an Elizabethan banquet hall, with a high timber truss ceiling and oak-paneled walls. The style is unique among the residential colleges, but akin to that of the University Commons. Unlike Commons, which is the largest dining venue on campus, the Great Hall was designed to be one of the smallest dining halls at Yale. On the upper walls are portraits of former heads, usually commissioned at the end of their tenure.
 Both libraries in JE are located in Weir Hall. At the foot of Weir Hall is Curtis &amp; Curtiss Library, a non-circulating library of JE memorabilia. It was designed by Rogers and features stained glass pieces produced by G. Owen Bonawit. The two-story Robert Taft Library, named for Senator Robert Taft, originally belonged to Weir Hall and was given over to the college in 1965.

JE has one of the smallest main college courtyards at Yale. At the college&#x27;s founding, the courtyard consisted of a lawn, referred to as the &quot;Greensward,&quot; and an elliptical pathway. The open expanse of grass was landscaped in 1989 and a gated Head&#x27;s Courtyard was constructed at the courtyard&#x27;s east end.

Three iron entryway gates were cast by blacksmith Samuel Yellin. Yellin emblazoned the main gate with the dates &quot;1720&quot; and &quot;1932&quot;, the year of Edwards&#x27; graduation from Yale and the year of the college&#x27;s founding, respectively.

== Art and artwork ==

===Memorabilia===
Tributes to Jonathan Edwards are found throughout the college. Given to Yale by Edwards&#x27; descendants, original portraits by Joseph Badger of Edwards and his wife, Sarah Pierpont Edwards, hang in the Head of College&#x27;s House dining room, and facsimiles hang in the Senior Common Room.

A walnut slant top desk believed to have belonged to Edwards also resides in the Head of College&#x27;s House. The desk was discovered in the basement of the old Divinity School during its demolition in 1931 and moved to JE.

In 2008, stone-cut replicas of the Edwards&#x27; tombstones, hand carved by The John Stevens Shop, were installed in the college&#x27;s basement.

===Sculpture===
Sculptures have adorned the courtyard since its opening. In the 1930s, the courtyard featured an early eighteenth-century bronze statue of a young slave holding a sundial, purported to have belonged to Elihu Yale. It has since been transferred to the Yale University Art Gallery. In 2012, a bronze sundial honoring Master Gary Haller was installed near the site of the original sundial, bearing the crest and badge of the college.

Since 1998, the Yale University Art Gallery has loaned a twelve-foot bronze sculpture by Dimitri Hadzi, entitled &quot;Floating Helmets&quot;, to the Head&#x27;s Courtyard.

=== The JE Press ===
JE is one of two residential colleges which maintains active use of its print shop, the JE Press. JE owns three manual press, one of which belonged to Frederic Goudy, and an automated Vandercook press. The JE Press is overseen by printer Richard Rose, who teaches classes each year in the printing arts.

===Exhibitions===
The work of artists affiliated with the college are on rotating display their art in the college&#x27;s basement art gallery. A permanent installation of prints by Walker Evans can also be found in the basement, as well as historical memorabilia and ephemera printed by the JE Press.

==Insignia==
The official insignia of JE is its shield, described in heraldic terms as &quot;ermine, a lion rampant vert&quot;. Designed by Fritz Kredel, it is a simplified version of the coat of arms believed to have been used by the Edwards family. A green, rearing heraldic lion symbolizes courage and purity of heart. Its crimson tongue and nails exhibit willingness to pursue its goals with passion both of speech and strength. The veil of white that surrounds the lion symbolizes the grace of God. This shield is used on formal decorations and college letterhead.

Other insignia have been informally adopted for the college. A red apple surrounded by a green serpent, a reference to the Book of Genesis, is used on blazers and other college apparel. It recalls the Reverend Jonathan Edwards&#x27; preoccupation with the doctrine of original sin. It was devised by the first Master and Fellows, and designed by H. Dillington Palmer. It forms the silver head of the ebony mace of the College.

The college&#x27;s mascot is the Spider, derived from a line in Jonathan Edwards&#x27; early descriptive writings on the creatures as well as his famous sermon &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,&quot; in which Edwards opines that &quot;The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked.&quot; Members of the college are called &quot;Spiders.&quot;

The unofficial motto of the College is &quot;JE SUX.&quot; In 1975, several JE students came up with a strategy for victory in the annual Bladderball game. The plan was to take possession of the giant bladderball with a meathook. The bladderball deflated after being punctured by the meathook, prematurely ending the game and causing students of other colleges to chant &quot;JE Sucks!&quot; That winter, the jeer was lightheartedly adopted by JE&#x27;s intramural ice hockey team, who went on to claim the intramural title. Since then, JE students have adopted the phrase as their rallying cry, with a slight twist: &quot;Sux&quot; instead of &quot;Sucks,&quot; a gesture to the university&#x27;s motto, &quot;Lux et Veritas&quot;.

== Student life ==

=== Student Activities ===
Yale&#x27;s residential colleges compete in an annual intramural competitions in several dozen events. Each year, the most winning college across all events receives the Tyng Cup. After clinching the cup only twice in the first seventy-five years of the competition, JE won three consecutive Tyng Cup championships in 2009-&#x27;10, 2010-&#x27;11, and 2011-&#x27;12. It is currently tied for eighth in all-time Tyng victories.

Like its counterparts in the other residential colleges, the Jonathan Edwards College Council (JECC) is the elected student council that governs student life in the college. In conjunction with the Head of College and Dean, the JECC manages student facilities, capital purchases, and residential policies. In addition, many college traditions are organized by the JECC. However, only around 27% of JE students are interested in anything the JECC has to say. The Social Activities Committee is a volunteer student group which plans and hosts study breaks, dances, and miscellaneous college events.

=== College traditions ===

==== Culture Draw ====
In a tradition dating back to the 1960s, a raffle is held each semester for the students of the college to attend cultural and artistic performances in New York and New Haven. Fellows of the college accompany groups of students to each performance, usually taking them to dinner beforehand. Culture Draw events usually include performances of the Metropolitan Opera and New York City Ballet, Broadway musicals and plays, and symphony orchestra concerts.

==== Dances ====
The JE Screw is the college&#x27;s iteration of the &quot;screw&quot; dances popular at Yale, during which suitemates will set up blind dates for each other and require pairs to &quot;find each other&quot; prior to the dance. JE Screw customarily takes place in the fall semester and is open to members of the college and their dates.

Considered the most formal of residential college balls, the Spider Ball is traditionally held immediately before Reading Period.

==== Annual Festivities ====
As a Fall semester in-gathering, students hold a &quot;Great Awakening&quot; courtyard picnic to commemorate the legacy of Jonathan Edwards and the American religious revival he inspired.

In October, students plant hundreds of tulip bulbs in courtyard planters, which bloom at the end of the spring semester. They also crown a Tulip Princess, a member of the college who most embodies the character or appearance of the flower.

Drawing on the Polish tradition of Dyngus Day, the &quot;Wet Monday&quot; water fight occurs each year at midnight on Easter Monday. While freshmen blitz the college with water balloons and squirt guns, upperclassmen attempt to defend the college quadrangle with an arsenal of hoses, water balloons, and other creative deterrents.

==== Men of JE ====
Formed in the fall of 1990 as a parody of singing group culture at Yale, the Men of JE are an audition-only a cappella group with a semi-secret membership. Claiming to be &quot;part a cappella group, part defender of Yale and JE ideals,&quot; the Men are known to pester and prank students in Branford and other residential colleges. They traditionally perform original songs at JE events, whether or not they are invited to do so.

====Branford College rivalry====
Borne of their proximity, JE has a longstanding rivalry with Branford College. For decades, students from each college have caused mischief within their counterpart&#x27;s buildings and grounds. It&#x27;s relatively common for Branford students to stand in the JE courtyard and brag about how much better their courtyard is. JE students try their best to counter these claims, but they don&#x27;t have too much to defend. Though most of the antics are spontaneous, every semester the Men of JE lead a late night brigade to Branford to disrupt last-minute studying at the end of Reading Period.

=== Sister college ===
JE&#x27;s sister college at Harvard is Eliot House, a relationship formalized in 1934. The hospitality of each college is open to the fellows and students of the other; this primarily occurs during The Game, when Eliot House and JE host students of the other college.

== Fellows and affiliates ==

=== Fellowship ===
By nomination of the Head of College and approval of the Council of Heads of College, any Yale faculty member or professional employee can be named a fellow of JE. The Head of College may also nominate associate fellows, defined broadly as any person who is not an employee or recent graduate of Yale College. Fellows hold weekly fellows dinners in the college, teach college seminars, advise students on their course of study, and participate in the ceremonies and traditions of the college. The fellowship&#x27;s most senior members appointed as president of the Junior Common Room and president of the Senior Common Room by order of seniority. Notable living fellows include Bob Alpern, Harold Bloom, David Bromwich, Scott Ellaway, Shelly Kagan, Frank Rich, Herbert Scarf, Tom Steitz, Florian Hill and Robert Stern.

==Fellowships==
The Alan S. Tetelman Fellowship, endowed in memory of a JE alumnus and professor of metallurgy at UCLA who was killed in a 1978 plane crash, supports lectures and research fellowships at Yale. It is administered by the Head of JE, who invites distinguished scientists and science advocates to give the semesterly Tetelman Lecture. Past lecturers include Robert Ballard, Harry Blackmun, Ben Carson, Murray Gell-Mann, the Dalai Lama, David Lee, Amartya Sen, Maxine Singer, and James Watson. The Tetelman Fellowship also supports undergraduate research in the natural and applied sciences.

In 1962, JE received a large bequest in memory of Robert C. Bates, a fellow of the college and professor of French, by his sister Amy Bradish Groesbeck. These funds are disbursed as teaching and undergraduate research fellowships.

<text>Kenneth Andre Ian Rodgers (December 2, 1934 – December 13, 2004) was a Major League Baseball shortstop who played for the New York / San Francisco Giants (1957–1960), Chicago Cubs (1961–1964), and Pittsburgh Pirates (1965–1967). He also played one season in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Taiyo Whales (1969). He batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed (14 stone, 4).

==Career==

A native of Nassau, Bahamas, Rodgers was the first Bahamian to play in the integrated major leagues (though Ormond Sampson, who debuted in 1932, played in the Negro leagues). He was a talented cricket player who paid his own way for a tryout with the Giants in 1954. Rodgers failed to make the team that year. He had to learn the rules of baseball, not to jump away from curveballs, and consequently, he adjusted and made his debut in 1957. Rodgers was a part of the Giants roster until October 1960 when he was traded to the Milwaukee Braves for Alvin Dark, who ultimately became the San Francisco manager at the time.

Before the 1961 season started, the Braves traded Rodgers to the Cubs. In 1962, he became the regular Cubs shortstop when Ernie Banks moved to first base. In that season, Rodgers, second baseman Ken Hubbs and Banks set a league record for double plays. After four productive seasons for the Cubs, Rodgers was traded to the Pirates.

In an 11-year career, Rodgers compiled a .249 batting average with 45 home runs and 245 RBI in 854 games. But even more important than the success he accomplished in his career was the fact that he opened the door for countrymen to follow, such as Ed Armbrister, Tony Curry, Wenty Ford, and Wil Culmer. Indeed, in the immediate years following his success, baseball began to emerge as the most popular sport in the Bahamas, and, in the 1960s, had become even more popular than cricket.

Andre Rodgers died in Nassau at the age of 70. Andre Rodgers National Baseball Stadium, which opened at Nassau&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Sports Centre in 2022, is named in his honor.

<text>3-Aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP, also called Triapine) is substance of interest for the treatment of cancer. It is a thiosemicarbazone derivative of 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde. It presents an N-N-S array of donor sites that strongly bind iron, robbing iron-containing enzymes of their prosthetic group.

It belongs to the family of drugs called ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors.

3AP is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, the rate determining enzyme in the supply of deoxynucleotides (DNA building blocks) for DNA synthesis. DNA synthesis is required for cellular proliferation and DNA repair. It is a very strong iron chelator and in the body it is likely that the iron chelate is the active species that quenches the active site tyrosyl radical required by ribonucleotide reductase for its enzymatic activity. The 3AP iron chelate is redox active and there have been several reports in the literature ascribing this property to some of the biological activities of 3AP. 3AP was chosen, based on the results of studying and the screening these products, as the candidate inhibitor most likely to express activity in the setting of human neoplastic disease. Vion Pharmaceuticals has also filed several use patents concerning the antiviral and antifungal activity of 3AP.

3AP was initially developed by Vion Pharmaceuticals until company declared bankruptcy in December 2009. Nanotherapeutics, Inc. acquired the product from bankruptcy in 2010 and supported trials at NCI until 2018 when the product was transferred to Nanoshift, LLC. Nanoshift LLC and Nanopharmaceutics, Inc. continue to support clinical studies with the NCI.

<text>Two national Freedom Trains have toured the United States: the 1947–49 special exhibit Freedom Train and the 1975–76 American Freedom Trainwhich celebrated the United States Bicentennial. Each train had its own special red, white and blue paint scheme and its own itinerary and route across the 48 contiguous states, stopping to visitors and displaying Americana and related historical artifacts. There are plans to run a Freedom Train again in 2026.

The 1940s Freedom Train exhibit was integrated—black and white viewers were allowed to mingle freely. When town officials in Birmingham, Alabama, and Memphis, Tennessee, refused to allow blacks and whites to see the exhibits at the same time, the Freedom Train skipped the planned visits, amid significant controversy.

==1947–1949 &quot;Freedom Train&quot;==


The first Freedom Train was proposed in April 1946 by Attorney General Tom C. Clark, who believed that Americans had begun taking the principles of liberty for granted in the post-war years. The idea was adopted by a coalition that included Paramount Pictures and the Advertising Council, which had just changed its name from &quot;War Advertising Council&quot;.

=== Plans and messaging ===
Thomas D&#x27;Arcy Brophy (of advertising firm Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt) described the Freedom Train as &quot;a campaign to sell America to Americans&quot;. The Advertising Council planned an assortment of other events to accompany the Train, including messages in radio programs, comic books, and films. In each city where the train stopped, they organized a &quot;Rededication Week&quot; for public celebrations of the United States. In February 1947, the group formed the &quot;American Heritage Foundation&quot; and named Brophy its president.

The Board of Trustees for the new foundation included:
* Winthrop W. Aldrich (chairman), president of Chase National Bank and brother-in-law of J. D. Rockefeller Jr.;
* Chester Barnard, chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation;
* John Foster Dulles, then a lawyer and Republican political advisor, soon to become the U.S. Secretary of State;
* Paul G. Hoffman, CEO of Studebaker automobile company, administrator of the Marshall Plan, and soon-to-be President of the Ford Foundation;
*Eric Johnston, former President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and president of the Motion Picture Association of America;
* Reinhold Niebuhr, prominent theologian; and 
* Charles E. Wilson, CEO of the General Electric Company and soon to be chief of the Office of Defense Mobilization—sometimes described as &quot;co-president&quot; of the United States under Truman.

The Board of Trustees did not include any African-Americans until &quot;after&quot; the train had launched. Walter White, Lester Granger, and A. Philip Randolph were proposed and rejected as candidates for membership. Frederick D. Patterson, president of Tuskegee Institute and founder of the United Negro College Fund was named as a trustee in October 1947.

American Federation of Labor President William Green and Congress of Industrial Organizations President Philip Murray were vice presidents of the Foundation.

The National Archives supplied the train with key documents, while, as archivist Elizabeth Hamer noted in August 1947, &quot;Hollywood, chiefly, is putting up the capital for this exhibit.&quot; The Foundation rejected the list of documents proposed by the National Archives, which included documents such as Executive Order 8802. Contrary to the wishes of the Justice Department, the Foundation excluded collective bargaining from the list of citizens&#x27; rights. In the final roster, the only document pertaining to black history was the Emancipation Proclamation—and even in this case, accompanying commentary focused on the white president Abraham Lincoln who issued the document. The Train also displayed a letter from Christopher Columbus, the Mayflower Compact, and documents of German and Japanese surrender from World War II.

While preparing for the tour, the planners decided to downplay comparisons of the United States with Nazis, as well as direct calls for foreign intervention. Instead they sought to focus on crafting a shared ideology for Americans. Clark wrote, &quot;Indoctrination in democracy is the essential catalytic agent needed to blend our various groups into one American family. Without it, we could not sustain the continuity of our way of life. In its largest sense, preaching Americanism is an affirmative declaration of our faith in ourselves.&quot;

The Train displayed exhibits such as &quot;Good Citizen&quot;, which portrayed men wearing suits Exhibits also defined American freedoms in terms of consumerism and boasted of superior commodity production. For women (more often referred to as &quot;girls&quot; or &quot;sisters&quot;), good citizenship was defined in terms of clothing, participation in certain acceptable community activities, and raising children.

=== Execution ===
An ALCO PA diesel-electric locomotive pulled the train, which carried the original versions of the United States Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Truman Doctrine, and the Bill of Rights on its tour of more than 300 cities in all 48 states. As Alaska and Hawaii did not gain statehood until 1959, this train toured all of the U.S. states that existed at the time. It was the first train to visit all 48 contiguous states (the 1936 Rexall Train had come close, but missed Nevada).

Top Marines were selected to attend to the train and its famous documents. The Marine contingent was led by Col. Robert F. Scott. According to attendees Mark and Mary Ellen Murphy:

&quot;With polite and firm prodding the Marines hurried through as many as 1200 persons an hour, giving each an average of three seconds to look at each exhibit. As they shuffled through the beige-and-green cars, they listened to regional and patriotic music played over a public address system and to a &#x27;move faster&#x27; exhortation by a suave Marine voice which came through the speaker every time a record changed.&quot;

The Freedom Train even had an official song, written by Irving Berlin and performed by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters.

The train&#x27;s first public display stop occurred in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 17, 1947. From there, the train traveled in a route that took it up to New England, down the Atlantic coast to Florida, across the nation&#x27;s southern states to California, up the Pacific coast to Washington, then across the northern states to Minnesota. After touring the perimeter of the nation, the train moved inland from Minnesota to Colorado then Kansas and Missouri, north to Wisconsin, then south to the Ohio River valley, north again to Michigan and finally east to New Jersey. The train&#x27;s official tour end occurred on January 22, 1949 in Washington, D.C., nearly three months after its last public display October 26, 1948, in Havre de Grace, Maryland. A notable stop on the train&#x27;s itinerary was its appearance at the Chicago Railroad Fair from July 5–9, 1948.

The American Heritage Foundation gave licenses to some vendors to sell Freedom Train gear such as books and postcards, while barring unauthorized merchants from selling other Freedom paraphernalia.

The white press favored the train with mostly positive coverage. One exception was John O&#x27;Donnell, who commented in the Washington &quot;Times-Herald&quot;: &quot;... we understand a committee headed by Winthrop Alrich, son-in-law of John D. Rockefeller Jr., is launching the campaign. Their wayward historical bus is scheduled to depart with great huzzahs from the White House ... Hold on to your hats, boys, you&#x27;re going for another ride and remember to keep the moths out of that uniform.&quot;

In the view of the Advertising Council, the Freedom Train succeeded, especially through the local rallies and media messages which accompanied it. This multifaceted project thus became a model for future efforts in the Cold War.

=== Conflict over segregation ===

The announcement of the Freedom Train plan on May 22, 1947, provoked spirited commentary on the state of Freedom in Black America. Black American poet Langston Hughes wrote a critical poem, &quot;Freedom Train&quot;, in which he described the Freedom Train passing through the segregated southern states, where black and white passengers rode in separate cars. The poem was famously recorded by Paul Robeson. Facing a public relations backlash and seeking to brand the Western Bloc as more free than its counterpart, the Truman administration announced in September 1947 a policy of desegregation for the train, scheduled to depart only two weeks later.

Mayor James J. Pleasants Jr., of Memphis, Tennessee announced that black and white people would be allowed to visit the Freedom Train only during separate visiting hours. (Pleasants acted with the support of Boss Edward H. Crump, the most influential figure in Memphis politics during the former half of the twentieth century.) When Freedom Train organizers then canceled the train&#x27;s planned stop in Memphis, Mayor Pleasants responded that segregated viewing hours were necessary to avert &quot;race trouble&quot; that would inevitably result from interracial &quot;jostling and pushing&quot;. To Freedom Train stops in other cities, the mayor&#x27;s office sent undercover agents, who reported that, first, some other southern cities had enforced segregation during viewing, and furthermore, that white patrons of the Freedom Train elsewhere had disliked the presence of Black Americans.

In Montgomery, Alabama, agitation by Edgar Nixon and Rosa Parks resulted in the appointment of black members to the local Freedom Train planning committee and a promise of desegregation during the train&#x27;s visit.

In Birmingham, Alabama, protest from public safety commissioner Bull Connor insisted that black and white people would wait for the train in separate lines and take turns entering. The idea behind the &quot;Birmingham Plan&quot; was that whites and blacks would technically be on board the train at the same time, without having to encounter each other directly. Under pressure, Connors and his colleague James E. Morgan stated:

Our segregation law is for the protection of the white and black races in the city, and for the prevention of disorders. . . . It is not a mantle to be set aside at the instance of this or that visitor to the city. If those in charge of the Freedom Train should see fit to bring it to Birmingham, they will be welcomed cordially, but cannot expect that either they or visitors to the Freedom Train will be exempt from our laws.

Under pressure and threat of boycott by various organizations including the NAACP, the American Heritage Foundation also canceled the Freedom Train&#x27;s appearance in Birmingham. The episode was somewhat embarrassing for collaborationist local black leaders Ernest Taggart and I. J. Israel, who defended their support of the segregated Freedom Train visit in the spirit of compromise.

Public critique of the Train continued during the tour. The &quot;Sunday Oregonian&quot; published a two-page section titled &quot;No Premium Fares on Freedom Train—But Actually Some Citizens Still Ride Second Class&quot;, detailing persistent discrimination and violence against Black Americans. These and other rumblings were described by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover as &quot;Negro Communist&quot; agitation.

==1975–76 &quot;American Freedom Train&quot;==

A second freedom train, the &quot;American Freedom Train&quot;, toured the country in 1975–76 to commemorate the United States Bicentennial.
The 26-car train was powered by 3 newly restored steam locomotives. The first to pull the train was the former Reading Company T-1 class 4-8-4 #2101. The second was the former Southern Pacific #4449, a 4-8-4 steam locomotive which pulled the train through the Western region. The third was the former Texas &amp; Pacific 2-10-4 #610, which pulled the train in Texas. Each locomotive pulled the train throughout a different region of the country. Due to light rail loadings and track conditions on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, diesels hauled the American Freedom Train from New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama. Diesels were also required in Chicago after the steam locomotive derailed attempting to negotiate tracks by the Chicago lakefront.

The train itself consisted of 10 display cars, converted from New York Central and Penn Central baggage cars. They carried more than 500 treasures of Americana, including George Washington&#x27;s copy of the Constitution, the original Louisiana Purchase, Judy Garland&#x27;s dress from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Joe Frazier&#x27;s boxing trunks, Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s pulpit and robes, replicas of Jesse Owens&#x27;s four Olympic gold medals from 1936 (one of which was stolen somewhere along the way), a pair of Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s basketball shoes, and a rock from the Moon. The train also consisted of two showcase cars, converted from NYC and PC baggage cars, #40 and #41. They had large showcase windows on either side, which the exhibits can be seen day and night. They carried a model of the Baltimore and Ohio &quot;Arabian&quot; steam locomotive, the Friendship Fire Engine from George Washington&#x27;s fire company, a 1904 Oldsmobile Runabout, a lunar rover, a map of the train&#x27;s journey, and the Freedom Bell.

The train&#x27;s tour of all across 48 contiguous states lasted from April 1, 1975, until December 31, 1976. More than 7 million Americans visited during its tour, while millions more stood trackside to see it go by.

The tour began in Wilmington, Delaware, and headed northeast to New England, west through Pennsylvania, Ohio to Michigan, then around Lake Michigan to Illinois and Wisconsin. From the Midwest, the tour continued westward, zigzagging across the plains to Utah and then up to the Pacific Northwest. From Seattle, Washington, the tour then traveled south along the Pacific coast to Southern California. The train and crew spent Christmas 1975 in Pomona, California, decorating #4449 with a large profile of Santa Claus on the front of the smokebox above the front coupler. For 1976, the tour continued from southern California eastward through Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, then turned north to visit Kansas and Missouri before traveling through the Gulf Coast states and then north again to Pennsylvania. The tour continued southeast to New Jersey then south along the Atlantic coast before finally ending December 26, 1976, in Miami, Florida. The last visitor went through the train on December 31, 1976. By the time the tour ended, the &quot;American Freedom Train&quot; had traveled 25,833 miles (40,858 kilometers) over 21 months, and stopped at 138 cities.

In early 1977, National Museums of Canada bought 15 of the cars and used them from 1978 to 1980 on a rail tour across Canada as the Discovery Train, a mobile museum focusing on that country&#x27;s history.

<text>The NHL Plus/Minus Award was a trophy awarded annually by the National Hockey League to the ice hockey &quot;player, having played a minimum of 60 games, who leads the league in plus-minus statistics.&quot; It was sponsored by a commercial business, and it had been known under five different names. First given for performance during the season, Wayne Gretzky won the award the most times, with three. Gretzky also led the league once prior to the inception of the award. Bobby Orr has led the NHL the most times in plus-minus, with six, all prior to the inception of the award. The award was discontinued after being awarded to Pavel Datsyuk following the season.

==History==
The plus/minus statistic was first established during the 1967–68 NHL season. This statistic reflects a player&#x27;s ability to contribute offensively and defensively. The award was first given at the end of the season. From to , it was known as the Emery Edge Award. During , there was no formal name for the Award. From to , it was known as the Alka-Seltzer Plus Award. From to , it was known as the Bud Ice Plus-Minus Award. Finally, from to , it was known as the Bud Light Plus-Minus Award.

Three-time winner Wayne Gretzky won the award the most times out of any player, and is one of only three repeat winners, joined by two-time winners John LeClair and Chris Pronger. Gretzky recorded the highest single-season result, +100, of all Award winners. The Award was won by players on the Edmonton Oilers and Detroit Red Wings four times each, with three wins by players on the Calgary Flames, Colorado Avalanche, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues.

Including the 20 seasons the League tracked plus-minus as a statistic without an award, the Boston Bruins have led the League 11 times (six by Bobby Orr and twice by David Krejci, the only other repeat leaders), Edmonton Oilers five times (four by Wayne Gretzky, including three official awards) and four times each by players on the Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers.

==Winners==

* Season shortened by the 1994–95 NHL lockout

Bold Player with the best plus-minus ever recorded in a season.

===Plus-minus leaders (1967–1982)===
Before 1983, there was no award for leading the League in plus-minus. The NHL started counting the statistics in 1967, and this lists all the leaders from the inception of the statistic to the inception of the award.


===Plus-minus leaders (2008–present)===
* Season shortened by the 2012–13 NHL lockout&lt;br&gt;
† Season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic
===Situational plus–minus leaders (2007–present)===
While not all types of goals are included in the calculation of plus-minus — such as power play goals — and every other type of goal is weighed the same, situational plus–minus (Sit +/−) allows for each goal to be included by adjusting by the number of skaters (i.e. not goaltenders) on the ice at the time of the goal, to accommodate for special-team and empty net goals. The plus–minus rating is calculated by dividing the number of skaters on the ice for the team scored upon by the number of skaters on the ice for the scoring team, applied as a plus to all players (including goaltenders) on the ice for the scoring team and as a minus for all players (including goaltenders) on the ice for the team scored upon. This also allows the statistics to be applied to goaltenders.

During the 2002–03 season, there was a tie between Peter Forsberg and Milan Hejduk of the Colorado Avalanche.

<text>Idarubicin or 4-demethoxydaunorubicin is an anthracycline antileukemic drug. It inserts itself into DNA and prevents DNA unwinding by interfering with the enzyme topoisomerase II. It is an analog of daunorubicin, but the absence of a methoxy group increases its fat solubility and cellular uptake.
Similar to other anthracyclines, it also induces histone eviction from chromatin.

It belongs to the family of drugs called antitumor antibiotics.

It is currently combined with cytosine arabinoside as a first line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

It is used for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis.

It is distributed under the trade names Zavedos (UK) and Idamycin (USA).

== Side effects ==
Diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting are common among patients treated with idarubicin.

<doc id="1300659" wikidata="Q2056590" url="?curid=1300659" title="Afternoon Delight">
<text>&quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; is a song recorded by Starland Vocal Band. It was written by band member Bill Danoff. In the US, it became a #1 single on July 10, 1976, and earned a gold record.

==Background and writing==
The title came from the happy hour menu at Clyde&#x27;s restaurant in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., where Bill Danoff was eating with fellow bandmember Margot Chapman, while his then-wife Taffy Danoff was undergoing surgery for cervical cancer. Danoff downplayed the lyrics: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to write an all-out sex song ... I just wanted to write something that was fun and hinted at sex.&quot;

==Cover versions==
Concurrent with the Starland Vocal Band version, country singer Johnny Carver&#x27;s cover went Top 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles.
In the 2004 film &quot;,&quot; the song is sung by the news crew in choir and referenced multiple times and came with a music video in the bonus disc.

&quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; has been featured in episodes of numerous TV shows, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;. In 2011, the song was covered by Glee cast and the actor John Stamos for season 2 episode 15 &quot;Sexy&quot; of the musical television series &quot;Glee&quot;. This was included in the versions of the album &quot;&quot; that were released in the UK, Brazil, and Japan, to replace the cover of &quot;Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)&quot; (from the same episode), a song co-written by Gary Glitter.

Matt Damon&#x27;s character mockingly sings the song in the film, Good Will Hunting, and later, the song is used in the end credits.

==Critical reaction==
At the 19th Grammy Awards ceremony in 1977, &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; received three nominations for recordings from 1976. It won the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement for Voices and was also nominated for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Song of the Year.

In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; the 20th sexiest song of all time.

<text>Leslie Ann Charleson (February 22, 1945 – January 12, 2025) was an American actress, best known for her role as Monica Quartermaine on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Life and career==
Charleson was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on February 22, 1945. Actress Kate Charleson was her sister. Her career began on short-lived ABC daytime soap opera &quot;A Flame in the Wind&quot; in 1964. In 1966 she joined the cast of &quot;As the World Turns.&quot; In 1968, she played the role of a doctor&#x27;s daughter in &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; in the episode &quot;The Night of Fire and Brimstone&quot;. From 1967 to 1970, she starred on the CBS soap opera &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot;. She played the role of Iris Donnelly Garrison. Her character was a part of a highly popular love triangle with David Birney and Donna Mills.

Charleson guest-starred on many series from 1970 to 1977, including &quot;Adam-12&quot;; &quot;Emergency!&quot;; &quot;Ironside&quot;; &quot;Mannix; Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;; &quot;Happy Days&quot;; &quot;Cannon&quot;; &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;; and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. She had a supporting role in the 1973 science-fiction film &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; and co-starred opposite Shelley Winters in the television thriller &quot;Revenge!&quot; (1971). Charleson also had leading roles in a number of unsuccessful television pilots, most notable 1975 sitcom pilot &quot;Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner&quot;.

On August 16, 1977, Charleson returned to daytime television with the role of Monica Quartermaine in the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Fred Silverman, then president of ABC, asked her to join the series, which at that time was near the bottom of the ratings and near cancellation. For her role, Charleson received four Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series nominations: in 1980, 1982, 1983 and 1995. During her &quot;General Hospital&quot; years, Charleson starred alongside Deidre Hall and Colleen Zenk in the 1993 made-for-television movie &quot;Woman on the Ledge&quot;. She also guest-starred on sitcoms &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Friends&quot; in 2004. On August 24, 2010, it was announced that Charleson was being demoted to recurring status. Charleson was the longest-serving cast member of &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

===Death===
Charleson died in Los Angeles on January 12, 2025, at the age of 79. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, she had experienced &quot;several falls&quot;, which caused problems with her mobility, and had been hospitalized from one of them the week before her death. Her death certificate, publicly reported in February 2025, concluded that the immediate cause of death was sequelae of blunt head trauma, which was the result of a previous head injury.

<doc id="1300665" wikidata="Q4637188" url="?curid=1300665" title="4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide">
<text>4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (also known as 4-NQO, 4NQO, 4Nqo, NQO and NQNO) is a quinoline derivative and a tumorigenic compound used in the assessment of the efficacy of diets, drugs, and procedures in the prevention and treatment of cancer in animal models. It induces DNA lesions usually corrected by nucleotide excision repair.

==General==
4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) is a quinoline, a carcinogenic and mutagenic chemical. Quinolines, like 4NQO, possess a heterocyclic aromatic structure and the same basic chemical formula of C9H7N. 4NQO may naturally occur in the environment but is typically manufactured for research purposes. 4NQO is known to mimic the biological effects of ultraviolet light on various organisms. Both 4NQO and its reduced metabolite 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide (4HAQO) bind covalently to cellular macromolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins.

4NQO has been shown to trap topoisomerase I cleavage complexes. It may also induce DNA damage through the production of reactive oxygen species thought to arise from enzymatic reduction of its nitro group, although its exact mechanism is unknown. 4NQO’s reactive oxygen species may serve as a byproduct of DNA damage or signaling molecule from damage. In response to damage from 4NQO, cells attempt to repair and initiate a transcriptional response to detoxify the cell from 4NQO and its metabolites.

==Technical==
DNA damage by 4NQO is a potent model. 4NQO induces DNA lesions usually corrected by nucleotide excision repair. 4NQO’s four electron reduction product, 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide (4HAQO), is believed to be a carcinogenic metabolite of 4NQO. When 4NQO is metabolized to its electrophilic reactant, selyl-4HAQO, it reacts with DNA to form stable quinolone monoadducts considered responsible for its mutagenicity and genotoxicity.

The stable quinolone monoadducts oxidize to form 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG), which, if left unrepaired, lead to transversions of guanines to thymines, which are nucleotides in DNA. Despite the direct mutagenic properties of 4HAQO, it is less toxic than 4NQO, indicating that metabolism of 4NQO produces other reactive chemicals such as anion radical metabolites.

Yeast species have been used to map polymorphic regions in response to 4NQO, identifying the polymorphic transcription factor Yrr1. Yrr1 confers 4NQO resistance to wild-type S. cerevisiae yeast, binding upstream from core genes well-known to regulation drug response. Yrr1 shifts cellular response in resistance to 4NQO and rates of respiration. In a recent study in yeast, 4NQO was shown to affect chromatin remodelling, cell division and DNA damage repair pathways.

<text>The Honourable George Percy ( – ) was an English explorer, author, and early Colonial Governor of Virginia.

==Early life==
Master George Percy (sometimes written as &quot;Percie&quot; or &quot;Percye&quot;) was born in England, the youngest son of Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland and Lady Catherine Neville. He was sickly for much of his life, possibly suffering from epilepsy or severe asthma. He graduated from Oxford University in 1597. While at university, he gained admission to Gloucester Hall and the Middle Temple.

Percy&#x27;s vocation was the military. His first service came in the Dutch struggle for independence from Spain in the early 1600s. He also served in Ireland.

==Life in Virginia==

Percy was part of the first group of 105 English colonists to settle the Jamestown Colony. It is thought he was sent to the warmer climate of Virginia to benefit poor health. He departed England in December 1606 and kept a journal of his voyage. He arrived in Virginia in April 1607 and recorded the struggles of the colonists to cope with the American environment, disease, and the Powhatan Native Americans. &quot;Thus we lived for the space of five months in this miserable distress,&quot; he wrote in his journal, &quot;not having five able men to man our bulwarks upon any occasion.&quot;

Although Percy had a higher social rank than all of the other first colonists, he was initially denied a seat on the Virginia Council. Nevertheless, he took the lead in the early life of the colony, taking part in the expedition to the James River falls in May and June 1607. In autumn 1607, he sided with the President of the colony, Edward Maria Wingfield, who was subsequently deposed by John Ratcliffe, Gabriel Archer, and Captain John Smith. From late 1607 until autumn 1609, Percy had little power in Jamestown but served as Smith&#x27;s subordinate.

When Smith left the colony in September 1609, Percy assumed the presidency of the colony. However, his persistent illness kept him from executing his office, leaving the duties of the presidency to Ratcliffe, Archer, and John Martin. It was during Percy&#x27;s tenure that the colony suffered through the &quot;Starving Time&quot; in the winter of 1609–10. &quot;Now all of us at James Town beginning to feel that sharp prick of hunger, which no man truly describe but he which hath tasted the bitterness thereof,&quot; he recounted later. Percy accomplished little while President, other than to order to construction of Fort Algernon at Old Point Comfort. When Sir Thomas Gates arrived in May 1610, Percy happily surrendered control of the colony to him.

In June 1610, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr arrived in Jamestown and with a commission to serve as the colony&#x27;s governor. De la Warr appointed Percy to the council and named him captain of the Jamestown fort. In August 1610, De la Warre sent Percy and seventy men to attack the Paspahegh and Chickahominy tribes. The force ravaged the tribal settlements, burning their buildings, decimating their crops, and indiscriminately killing men, women, and children. Percy also led the successful defense of the Jamestown fort against a Native American attack and earned the praise of De La Warr. When the Governor returned to England in March 1611, he appointed Percy to lead the colony in his absence. &quot;But the winds not favoring them, they were enforced to shape their course directly for England—my lord having left and appointed me deputy governor in his absence, to execute martial law or any other power and authority as absolute as himself.&quot;

Percy&#x27;s term as Governor lasted until shortly before 25 May 1611, when Sir Thomas Dale, his replacement, wrote to the Virginia Company from Jamestown, that he was received by Percy, who, after hearing his commission read, surrendered up his own, &#x27;it being accordingly so to expire.&#x27;.

On 22 April 1612, he departed Virginia for England.

==After Virginia==
After his service as Virginia colony governor, Percy returned to England but remained interested in colonization schemes. In 1615, he proposed an expedition to Guiana but found no supporters. In 1620, he sold his four shares in the Virginia Company and returned to military service.

Percy returned to the Netherlands in 1621 when war between Spain and the Dutch Republic resumed. He was the commander of a company in the Low Countries in 1627..

Percy returned to England, where died before 19 March 1632, where and when he was buried at London St Giles without Cripplegate, Middlesex (London), England. He most likely died while living in London at Syon House, the London home of his brother the Duke of Northumberland. It was located in the Parish of St Martin in the Fields, Westminster. Syon House remains in the family of the Dukes of Northumberland, the latest of which still resides there.

==Marriage and Family==
First, to address a long standing myth perpetuated on some more recent genealogy websites:

Only one book asserts, with no dates, places or any sources cited, that George Percy married a woman named Anne Floyd, and they had a daughter, Anne Percy, who married Governor John West. The authors also caveat this passage with: &quot;This however, is not absolutely certain. Ann Floyd remained behind in America after her husband’s return to England&quot;. However, even their own caveat is suspect because there are no females named Percy or Floyd in the Jamestown Lists of Living &amp; Dead in 1623, and none in the 1624/25 Muster.

These authors also contradict other, and more authoritative, published sources that do include convincing primary source references. At least two other published books assert that George Percy died unmarried in 1632. In this work, following the list of sons of the Eighth Earl, George being at the very end, are listed the three daughters of Henry Percy, the Eight Earl, and were therefore sisters of George Percy: Lady Anne Percy, who died an infant, Lady Lucy Percy and Lady Eleanor Percy. The last two married and had issue. It could be that from this list of the sisters of George Percy, misinterpreted as being his family, the myth of a wife Ann and daughter Ann may have first arisen. This author cites one of his primary sources thusly: &quot;This account of the issue of the eighth Earl of Northumberland, so full and accurate, is chiefly given from MS Collections of the late Thomas Butler, Esq. agent to his Grace the Duke of Northumberland, and clerk of the peace for the county of Middlesex, who died 1777. The births, &amp; c are chiefly from Petworth Register.&quot;. This seems to indicate primary sources from the family register were actually used for their work. Those manuscripts are now held privately in England, probably at The Archives of the Duke of Northumberland at Alnwick Castle.

Many more books and other sources do not mention a wife or children at all, inferring that there were neither.

Based on the two credible sources now available, one being derived from the Percy family&#x27;s own Petworh Register, he clearly could not have had a wife or a daughter.

<text>Carnival Paradise (formerly Paradise) is a operated by Carnival Cruise Line. Built by Kværner Masa-Yards at its Helsinki New Shipyard in Helsinki, Finland, she was floated out on 29 January 1998, and christened as &quot;Paradise&quot; by Paula Zahn. During 2007, in common with all of her &quot;Fantasy&quot;-class sisters, she had the prefix &quot;Carnival&quot; added to her name.

==History==
&quot;Carnival Paradise&quot; was built to be the world&#x27;s first completely non-smoking cruise ship and she was entered into service supported by several anti-smoking and cancer-prevention groups. &quot;No smoking&quot; signs were placed prominently on both sides of the ship and on the stern under the name.

Non-smoking rules were strictly enforced. No smoking materials of any kind were permitted aboard. If anything was seen or found, the passenger was fined $250 and put off at the next port, with their transportation home under the passenger&#x27;s own expense. Due to poor revenue, Carnival decided to discontinue the smoke-free policy in December 2003, claiming that non-smokers tend to not drink or gamble as much as those accustomed to smoke.

Scheduled to arrive at the Port of Long Beach, California, on 20 September 2004, her arrival was delayed due to several major hurricanes (see 2004 Atlantic hurricane season). Her cruise through the Caribbean and Panama Canal, and up the Mexican coast was further hindered by more hurricanes. After having skirted the bad weather with minimal inconvenience, &quot;Paradise&quot; arrived at the Long Beach cruise terminal in the early morning. Later that day, the non-smoking signs were painted over.

In 2021, she was repainted into Carnival&#x27;s new livery.

== Service history ==
Starting in 1998 to 2004, &quot;Carnival Paradise&quot; sailed 7 Day cruises to the Caribbean from Miami.

In 2004 she repositioned to Long Beach, California. After her arrival in Long Beach, she undertook 3-day and 4-day cruises to Ensenada, Mexico and Santa Catalina Island, California.

In late 2011, Carnival moved &quot;Carnival Paradise&quot; to Tampa, replacing the &quot;Carnival Inspiration&quot;, which went to California. Currently, &quot;Carnival Paradise&quot; takes 4 and 5 night voyages to the Western Caribbean and Bahamas. The ship also used to sail to Havana, Cuba and Key West, Florida on select sailings from 2017 to 2019.

In 2018, she underwent a month-long dry dock in Freeport, Bahamas, which added a 14th deck to the front of the ship to accommodate 38 new cabins.

In 2023, Carnival Paradise underwent another refit during her October dry dock which added new spaces as well as upgrades to the vessel.

<text>Teh talua or teh telur (egg tea) is a tea beverage from West Sumatra, Indonesia. The tea is unique due to its use of egg yolk in its preparation. Chicken or duck egg can be used to prepare the tea. Other ingredients, in addition to tea and egg yolk, include sugar and calamondin.

A traditional method of preparing this drink involves stirring the egg yolk and two spoons of sugar or condensed milk in a glass until a batter is developed. Hot tea is then gradually stirred into the batter to combine the two elements. Calamondin juice can be then added according to taste, to remove any remaining unpleasant smell.

<text>Wallace Gordon Parks (January 23, 1913 – September 28, 2007) was an American writer. He was the founder, president, and chairman of the National Hot Rod Association, better known as NHRA. He was instrumental in establishing drag racing as a legitimate amateur and professional motorsport.

==Biography==
Parks was an accomplished automobile writer and hobbyist, and co-founder and first editor of the magazine &quot;Hot Rod&quot; in January 1948. He was also instrumental in the founding of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine in September 1949. As editor of &quot;Hot Rod,&quot; he began to promote safety in the organization of drag racing, both in the magazine and by organizing &quot;Safety Safaris,&quot; the first of which toured the United States in 1954, teaching drag race organization and safety at tracks around the country. This was the first concerted effort in getting racers off the streets and onto controlled race tracks.

In 1951, he founded the National Hot Rod Association, which stands today as the largest motorsports sanctioning body in the world, and became its president for several decades after leaving the magazine business. His wife, Barbara, who preceded him in death in 2006, worked for the NHRA as its Chief Secretary in its formative years.

Parks played a part in promoting drag racing outside of the United States, organizing tours to England in 1964 and 1965, in collaboration with Sydney Allard, and to Australia in 1966.

Winners of National Hot Rod Association national events are awarded a trophy statue nicknamed the Wally. The trophy is a bronze statue of a Top Gas racer next to a tire on a wooden platform. As the NHRA celebrated its 60th anniversary season in 2011, pewter Wally trophies were awarded to all of the winners during that season. Other events celebrating milestones may award Wally trophies in varying colors.

Parks died on September 28, 2007, due to complications from pneumonia, at the age of 94. Prior to his death, he was chairman of the Wally Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum in Pomona, California.

==Awards==
Parks was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1992.

He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1993.

<doc id="1300684" wikidata="Q238512" url="?curid=1300684" title="Fluorouracil">
<text>Fluorouracil (5-FU, 5-fluorouracil), sold under the brand name Adrucil among others, is a cytotoxic chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer. By intravenous injection it is used for treatment of colorectal cancer, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. As a cream it is used for actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and skin warts.
Side effects of use by injection are common. They may include inflammation of the mouth, loss of appetite, low blood cell counts, hair loss, and inflammation of the skin. When used as a cream, irritation at the site of application usually occurs. Use of either form in pregnancy may harm the fetus. Fluorouracil is in the antimetabolite and pyrimidine analog families of medications. How it works is not entirely clear, but it is believed to involve blocking the action of thymidylate synthase and thus stopping the production of DNA.
Fluorouracil was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 270th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

Fluorouracil has been given systemically for anal, breast, colorectal, oesophageal, stomach, pancreatic and skin cancers (especially head and neck cancers). It has also been given topically (on the skin) for actinic keratoses, skin cancers and Bowen&#x27;s disease (a type of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma), and as eye drops for treatment of ocular surface squamous neoplasia. Other uses include ocular injections into a previously created trabeculectomy bleb to inhibit healing and cause scarring of tissue, thus allowing adequate aqueous humor flow to reduce intraocular pressure.

==Contraindications==
Fluorouracil is contraindicated in patients who are severely debilitated and in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women.

Non-topical use, i.e. administration by injection, should be avoided in patients who do not have malignant illnesses.

in 2020, the EU and UK license was updated to state that fluorouracil was contra-indicated in patients that &quot;have a known complete absence of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity&quot;. In US, as of 2024, there is no specific contraindication on the package inserts however, there is a cautionary warning: &quot;Increased risk of serious or fatal adverse reactions in patients with low or absent Dipyrimidine Dehydrogenase activity: withhold or permanently discontinue fluorouracil in patients with evidence of acute early-onset or unusually severe toxicity, which may indicate near complete or total absence of dipyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity.

No fluorouracil dose has been proven safe in patients with absent DPD activity&quot;

Within the UK, DPYD testing to check for this contraindication is now routine practice, this is not the case in the US.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects by frequency include:

===During systemic use===
Common (&gt; 1% frequency):
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea (see below for details)
* Mucositis
* Headache
* Hand-foot syndrome
* Myelosuppression (see below for details)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Photosensitivity
* Maculopapular eruption
* Itch
* Cardiotoxicity (see below for details)
* Persistent hiccups
* Mood disorders (irritability, anxiety, depression)
Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency):

* Oesophagitis
* GI ulceration and bleeding
* Proctitis
* Nail disorders
* Vein pigmentation
* Confusion
* Cerebellar syndrome
* Encephalopathy
* Visual changes
* Photophobia
* Lacrimation (the expulsion of tears without any emotional or physiologic reason)
Rare (&lt; 0.1% frequency):
* Anaphylaxis 
* Allergic reactions
* Fever without signs of infection
* Mania, reversible dementia

Diarrhea is severe and may be dose-limiting and is exacerbated by co-treatment with calcium folinate. Neutropenia tends to peak about 9–14 days after beginning treatment. Thrombocytopenia tends to peak about 7–17 days after the beginning of treatment and tends to recover about 10 days after its peak. Cardiotoxicity is a fairly common side effect, usually manifesting as angina or symptoms associated with coronary artery spasm, but about 0.55% of those receiving the drug will develop life-threatening cardiotoxicity. Life-threatening cardiotoxicity includes: arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest, secondary to transmural ischaemia.

===During topical use===
Common (&gt; 1% frequency):

* Local pain
* Itchiness
* Burning
* Stinging
* Crusting
* Weeping
* Dermatitis
* Photosensitivity
Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency):
* Hyper- or hypopigmentation
* Scarring

===Neurological damage===
The United States package insert warns that acute cerebellar syndrome has been observed following injection of fluorouracil and may persist after cessation of treatment. Symptoms include ataxia, nystagmus, and dysmetria.

==Potential overdose==
There is very little difference between the minimum effective dose and maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU, and the drug exhibits marked individual pharmacokinetic variability. Therefore, an identical dose of 5-FU may result in a therapeutic response with acceptable toxicity in some patients and unacceptable and possibly life-threatening toxicity in others. Both overdosing and underdosing are of concern with 5-FU, although several studies have shown that the majority of colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-FU are underdosed based on today&#x27;s dosing standard, body surface area (BSA). The limitations of BSA-based dosing prevent oncologists from being able to accurately titer the dosage of 5-FU for the majority of individual patients, which results in sub-optimal treatment efficacy or excessive toxicity.

Numerous studies have found significant relationships between concentrations of 5-FU in blood plasma and both desirable or undesirable effects on patients. Studies have also shown that dosing based on the concentration of 5-FU in plasma can greatly increase desirable outcomes while minimizing negative side effects of 5-FU therapy. One such test that has been shown to successfully monitor 5-FU plasma levels and which &quot;may contribute to improved efficacy and safety of commonly used 5-FU-based chemotherapies&quot; is the My5-FU test.

Uridine Triacetate is a potential antidote for cases of suspected overdose.

==Dangers to pets==
The US Food and Drug Administration has highlighted the dangers of inadvertent administration to pets. While fluorouracil is sometimes used off label to treat horses, its administration to dogs in particular can be fatal.

The FDA reports that it has received 20 reports of fatal outcomes in dogs following accidental ingestion of topical fluorouracil.

== Interactions ==

It may increase the INR and prothrombin times in people on warfarin. Fluorouracil&#x27;s efficacy is decreased when used alongside allopurinol, which can be used to decrease fluorouracil induced stomatitis through use of allopurinol mouthwash.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacogenetics===

The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme is responsible for the detoxifying metabolism of fluoropyrimidines, a class of drugs that includes 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and tegafur. Genetic variations within the DPD gene (&quot;DPYD&quot;) can lead to reduced or absent DPD activity, and individuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for these variations may have partial or complete DPD deficiency; an estimated 0.2% of individuals have complete DPD deficiency. Those with partial or complete DPD deficiency have a significantly increased risk of severe or even fatal drug toxicities when treated with fluoropyrimidines; examples of toxicities include myelosuppression, neurotoxicity and hand-foot syndrome.

===Mechanism of action===
5-FU acts in several ways, but principally as a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor. Interrupting the action of this enzyme blocks synthesis of the pyrimidine thymidylate (dTMP), which is a nucleotide required for DNA replication. Thymidylate synthase methylates deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to form thymidine monophosphate (dTMP). Administration of 5-FU causes a scarcity in dTMP, so rapidly dividing cancerous cells undergo cell death via thymineless death. Calcium folinate provides an exogenous source of reduced folinates and hence stabilises the 5-FU-TS complex, hence enhancing 5-FU&#x27;s cytotoxicity.

==History==
In 1954, Abraham Cantarow and Karl Paschkis found liver tumors absorbed radioactive uracil more readily than did normal liver cells. Charles Heidelberger, who had earlier found that fluorine in fluoroacetic acid inhibited a vital enzyme, asked Robert Duschinsky and Robert Schnitzer at Hoffmann-La Roche to synthesize fluorouracil. Some credit Heidelberger and Duschinsky with the discovery that 5-fluorouracil markedly inhibited tumors in mice. The original 1957 report
In 1958, Anthony R. Curreri, Fred J. Ansfield, Forde A. McIver, Harry A. Waisman, and Charles Heidelberger reported the first clinical findings of 5-FU&#x27;s activity in cancer in humans.

==Natural analogues==
In 2003, scientists isolated 5-fluorouracil derivatives, closely related compounds, from the marine sponge, &quot;Phakellia fusca&quot;, collected around Yongxing Island of the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea. This is significant because fluorine-containing natural products are extremely rare.

==Interactive pathway map==
==Names==
The name &quot;fluorouracil&quot; is the INN, USAN, USP name, and BAN. The form &quot;5-fluorouracil&quot; is often used; it shows that there is a fluorine atom on the 5th carbon of a uracil ring.

<doc id="1300690" wikidata="Q822467" url="?curid=1300690" title="Stone of Jacob">
<text>The Stone of Jacob appears in the Book of Genesis as the stone used as a pillow by the Israelite patriarch Jacob at the place later called Bet-El. As Jacob had a vision in his sleep, he then consecrated the stone to God. More recently, the stone has been claimed by Scottish folklore and British Israelism.

==Biblical narrative==

According to account given in Genesis, Jacob was fleeing from his elder twin brother Esau, whom he had tricked out of receiving their father Isaac&#x27;s blessing of the first-born. On his flight, Jacob rested at a city called Luz and used a group of stones as a pillow.

After waking up, Jacob exclaimed, &quot;How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.&quot; Subsequently, he called the place Bethel, which translates to &quot;House of God&quot;. He set up the stone he had slept on as a pillow, and consecrated it. He also made a vow to God in reference to his eventual return.

==Other traditions==

Some Scottish legends surrounding the Stone of Scone, traditionally used for coronations of Scottish kings in the High Middle Ages, have identified this stone with the Stone of Jacob. Supposedly the Stone of Jacob was brought to Ireland by the prophet Jeremiah and thence to Scotland. The 17th-century writer John Speed, describing the coronation of James I, calls the stone at Westminster Abbey by the Latin name, &quot;saxum Jacobi&quot;.

These legends also feature prominently in British Israelism a belief system that holds the British royal family is descended from King David. From 1308 to 1996, the Stone of Scone rested in the King Edward&#x27;s Chair at Westminster. On 23 December 2020 it was announced by the Scottish Government that the stone is to be relocated to a newly renovated &#x27;Hall of Destiny&#x27; in Perth&#x27;s city centre, only a few miles from Scone.

<text>Nelarabine, sold under the brand names Arranon (US) and Atriance (EU), is a chemotherapy medication used for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL).

Nelarabine is a prodrug of arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (araGTP), a type of purine nucleoside analog, which causes inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. Pre-clinical studies suggest that T-cells are particularly sensitive to nelarabine. In October 2005, it was approved by the FDA for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma that has not responded to or has relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens. It was later approved in the European Union in October 2005. It is available as a generic medication.

<text>Juanita Broaddrick is an American former nursing home administrator. She alleged that she was raped by U.S. President Bill Clinton on April 25, 1978, when he was the Attorney General of Arkansas. Clinton declined to comment on the issue.

Rumors had circulated about such an event for years and it had been recorded in a letter prepared by a Republican rival of Clinton&#x27;s around 1991, but Broaddrick refused to speak to news media until 1999. In a sworn statement in 1997 with the placeholder name &quot;Jane Doe #5&quot;, Broaddrick filed an affidavit with Paula Jones&#x27;s lawyers stating there were unfounded rumors and stories circulating &quot;that Mr. Clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies. ... These allegations are untrue&quot;. She then recanted that statement to investigators of potential misconduct by Clinton led by Kenneth Starr, while insisting at the time that Clinton had not pressured or bribed her in any way. Starr declined to further investigate the issue, and mentioned it only in a footnote of his final report.

Speculation continued that Broaddrick had more to say on the matter, and in an interview with &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; that aired on February 24, 1999, Broaddrick discussed the matter in public for the first time, this time saying that Clinton had raped her, which a lawyer for Clinton denied to be true.

Broaddrick&#x27;s claims returned to public attention in relation to the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and the 2017 Me Too movement. She wrote a memoir repeating the allegation in 2018.

==Background==
Broaddrick is from Van Buren, Arkansas, a town in the northwest part of the state. She was born Juanita Smith to parents Buster Smith and Mary Elizabeth Smith. She has an older sister. Her father owned the Smith Cleaners establishment. The family belonged to the Episcopal Church. In her memoir she says her mother was physically and emotionally abusive to her and her sister.

Juanita Smith graduated from Van Buren High School in 1960. She attended nursing school at Sparks School of Nursing from 1960 to 1963. She then worked as a registered nurse at several nursing homes.

In 1974, she bought a nursing home in Van Buren. It was known as the Brownwood Manor Nursing Home. Her mother was part owner with her.

Juanita was first married to Gary Hickey, with the marriage happening before she left nursing school. They had a son, who was born around 1969.

==Allegations against Bill Clinton==

===1978: Her account===
Broaddrick, who was known as Juanita Hickey at the time, first met Clinton when he made a visit to her nursing home during his 1978 gubernatorial campaign. Clinton was the Arkansas Attorney General at the time. Broaddrick wanted to volunteer for the campaign, and says Clinton invited her to stop by the campaign office in Little Rock. She said she contacted the office a few weeks later while in the area for a nursing home conference and that Clinton said he would not be in the campaign office that day and suggested they meet at her hotel&#x27;s coffee shop instead. Upon his arrival, however, he allegedly requested that they instead have coffee in her room to avoid a crowd of reporters in the lobby, and Broaddrick agreed.

Broaddrick said the two spoke briefly in her room, with Clinton describing plans he had to renovate a prison visible from her window if he became governor. Then, according to Broaddrick, Clinton suddenly kissed her. Broaddrick says she pushed Clinton away and told him she was married and not interested, but he persisted. As recounted in the NBC interview:

When asked if there was any way Clinton could have thought it was consensual, Broaddrick said &quot;No, not with what I told him and with how I tried to push him away. It was not consensual.&quot;

Broaddrick shared the hotel room with her friend and employee Norma Rogers. Rogers attended a conference seminar that morning, and says she returned to their room to find Broaddrick on the bed &quot;in a state of shock&quot;, with her pantyhose torn in the crotch and her lip swollen as though she had been hit. Rogers says Broaddrick told her Clinton had &quot;forced himself on her&quot;. Rogers helped Broaddrick ice her lip, and then the women left Little Rock. Rogers said that Broaddrick was very upset on the way home and blamed herself for letting Clinton in the room. Broaddrick says she did not tell her husband, Gary Hickey, about the incident, and told him she accidentally injured her lip. He told NBC he did not remember the injury or her explanation. David Broaddrick, however, has said he noticed her injured lip, and she told him that Clinton had raped her when he asked about it. Three other friends confirmed that Broaddrick had told them about the incident at the time: Susan Lewis; Louis Ma; and Jean Darden, Norma Rogers&#x27; sister. Broaddrick did not recall the date of the alleged incident, but said it was spring of 1978 and that she had stayed in the Camelot Hotel. Records show Broaddrick attended a nursing home meeting at the Camelot Hotel in Little Rock on April 25, 1978. The Clinton White House would not respond to requests for Clinton&#x27;s official schedule for the date, but news reports suggest that he was in Little Rock that day, with no official commitments in the morning.

Three weeks after the alleged assault, Broaddrick participated in a small Clinton fundraiser at the home of a local dentist. Broaddrick said she was &quot;in denial&quot; and felt guilty, thinking that she had given Clinton the wrong idea by letting him into her room. When she arrived at the event, she says, her friend who had picked the Clintons up from the airport told her that Hillary Clinton had asked if she would be at the event. Broaddrick says Bill Clinton did not speak to her at the event, but Hillary Clinton approached her, took her hand, and said &quot;I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate what you do for him.&quot; When Broaddrick moved her hand away, she says, Hillary Clinton held on to her and said, &quot;Do you understand? Everything that you do.&quot; Broaddrick says she felt nauseated and left the gathering. Broaddrick says she interpreted the incident as Hillary Clinton thanking her for keeping quiet.

===Subsequent developments===
Juanita Hickey divorced Gary Hickey around 1979 and married David Broaddrick around 1981.

Broaddrick opened a second facility, to provide services for mentally disabled children in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

In 1984, Broaddrick&#x27;s nursing facility was adjudged the best in the state, which brought a congratulatory official letter from the governor. On the bottom was a handwritten note from Clinton, saying, &quot;I admire you very much.&quot;

Broaddrick said that in 1991, Clinton called her out of a state nursing standards meeting to try to apologize: &quot;&#x27;Juanita, I&#x27;m so sorry for what I did. I&#x27;m not the man that I used to be, can you ever forgive me? What can I do to make this up to you?&#x27; And I&#x27;m standing there in absolute shock. And I told him to go to hell, and I walked off.&quot; Jean Darden, in whom Broaddrick had confided about the incident, also attended the meeting and said she saw Broaddrick talking to Clinton in the hallway. Clinton announced his 1992 presidential campaign soon after that alleged interaction.

===1992–1998===
Though Broaddrick was resistant to talking to the media, rumors about her story began circulating no later than Clinton&#x27;s presidential bid in 1992. Broaddrick had confided in Phillip Yoakum, whom she knew from business circles and at the time considered a friend. When Clinton won the Democratic nomination, Yoakum, widely considered to have a Republican agenda, contacted Sheffield Nelson, Clinton&#x27;s opponent in the 1990 gubernatorial race. Yoakum arranged a meeting between Nelson and Broaddrick, who resisted Yoakum&#x27;s and Nelson&#x27;s push that she go public. Yoakum secretly taped the conversation and wrote a letter summarizing the allegations, which began to circulate within Republican circles. The story reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in October 1992, but the papers dropped the story after Broaddrick refused to talk to reporters and Yoakum refused to release the recording.

In the fall of 1997, Paula Jones&#x27;s private investigators tried to talk to Broaddrick at her home, also secretly taping the conversation. Broaddrick refused to discuss the incident, saying &quot;it was just a horrible horrible thing,&quot; and that she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t relive it for anything.&quot; The investigators told her she would likely be subpoenaed if she would not talk to them. Broaddrick said she would deny everything, saying &quot;you can&#x27;t get to him, and I&#x27;m not going to ruin my good name to do it ... there&#x27;s just absolutely no way anyone can get to him, he&#x27;s just too vicious.&quot; Broaddrick was subpoenaed in the Jones suit soon after and submitted an affidavit denying that Clinton had made &quot;any sexual advances&quot;. The recording of Broaddrick&#x27;s conversation with the investigators was leaked to the press, but Broaddrick continued to refuse to speak to reporters.

Despite Broaddrick&#x27;s denial in her affidavit, Jones&#x27; lawyers included Yoakum&#x27;s letter and Broaddrick&#x27;s name in a 1998 filing. The letter suggested that the Clintons had bought Broaddrick&#x27;s silence, describing a phone call where Broaddrick&#x27;s husband asked Yoakum to say the incident never happened and said that he intended to ask Clinton &quot;for a couple of big favors&quot;. This, along with the discrepancy between the letter and Broaddrick&#x27;s affidavit, attracted the attention of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who was investigating Clinton for obstruction of justice. After being approached by the FBI, Broaddrick consulted her son, a lawyer, who told her she could not lie to federal investigators. After Starr granted her immunity, thus assuring that she would not be prosecuted for perjury regarding her affidavit in the Jones case, Broaddrick recanted the affidavit. However, she insisted that Clinton had not pressured or bribed her in any way, and so Starr concluded that the story was not relevant to his investigation and his report only mentioned the recanting in a footnote.

===1999===
Rumors continued to circulate in tabloids and on talk radio, now with Broaddrick&#x27;s name attached. Broaddrick was upset by a tabloid report that she had been paid to keep quiet, and decided to agree to an interview with NBC&#x27;s Lisa Myers. Myers interviewed her on December 20, 1998, the day after Clinton was impeached. The interview only aired on February 24, 1999, 35 days later and after Clinton had been acquitted on February 12. NBC was accused of intentionally sitting on the story and invoking unusually demanding standards of corroboration until the impeachment process ended. Broaddrick and another source said NBC gathered the key corroborating evidence within 10 days of the interview, NBC assistant producer Chris Giglio said it may have taken him 14 days—in either case, while the impeachment process was ongoing. Though the story was unaired, at least one Republican senator reportedly invoked it to convince undecided Republicans to vote for impeachment.

While NBC waited to air the interview, Broaddrick was approached by Dorothy Rabinowitz, who wrote for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial page. Upset with NBC&#x27;s delay, Broaddrick agreed to speak with Rabinowitz, and the story debuted on the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s editorial page on February 19. NBC aired Myers&#x27; interview soon after.

===Clinton response to allegations===
On Friday night, February 19, 1999, Clinton&#x27;s attorney, David Kendall, denied the allegations on Clinton&#x27;s behalf. Kendall stated: &quot;Any allegation that the president assaulted Mrs. Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely false. Beyond that, we&#x27;re not going to comment.&quot;

When asked about Broaddrick&#x27;s claims at a news conference on February 24, 1999, Clinton said: &quot;Well, my counsel has made a statement about the ... issue, and I have nothing to add to it.&quot; As of November 2020, he has not made any further public statements on the matter, and has not been sued or charged with any crimes in connection with Broaddrick&#x27;s allegations.

===Public and press reactions===
Because there was limited corroborating evidence for Broaddrick&#x27;s allegation and she had previously filed a sworn statement saying there was no assault, her allegation was not believed to be credible. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized it in 1999, &quot;There is no physical evidence to verify it. No one else was present during the alleged encounter in a Little Rock hotel room nearly 21 years ago. The hotel has since closed. And Mrs. Broaddrick denied the encounter in an affidavit in January 1998 in the Paula Jones case, in which she was known only as &#x27;Jane Doe No. 5&#x27;. Through all those years, she refused to come forward. When pressed by the Jones lawyers, she denied the allegation. And now, she has recanted that denial.&quot;

In March 1999 &quot;Slate&quot; magazine ran a much-cited article called &quot;Is Juanita Broaddrick Telling the Truth?&quot;, that gave possible grounds upon which Broaddrick should be believed, or should not be believed, regarding each of a number of key points. On the disbelief side, it was suggested that the five people who said Broaddrick had confided in them soon after the incident could be lying. This argument proposes that Rogers and Darden may have developed a grudge against Clinton; in 1980 as governor, he had commuted the life sentence of Guy Lavern Kuehn, the man who murdered their father in 1971. Skeptics also noted that even if these people were telling the truth, Broaddrick could have been lying to them at the time the original events took place.

Some details in Broaddrick&#x27;s account corresponded with other women&#x27;s allegations. In an interview that emerged after Broaddrick&#x27;s allegations, Elizabeth Gracen had said that Clinton bit her lip during a consensual encounter that became rough.

Broaddrick said that after the assault, Clinton told her not to worry about pregnancy because childhood mumps had rendered him sterile. When contacted about the issue, Gennifer Flowers, who Clinton later admitted to a sexual relationship with, also said that Clinton had thought he couldn&#x27;t have children. Clinton would go on to father one child, Chelsea Clinton, who was born in 1980.

In March 1999, shortly after the allegations publicly aired, 56% of Americans believed the allegations were false, while a third believed that Broaddrick&#x27;s allegation of rape was at least possibly true. Similarly, 66% of the public felt that the media should stop pursuing the story, while 29% felt the press should continue to investigate the allegation.

The public and media had &quot;scandal fatigue&quot; from the repeated sexual misconduct allegations against Clinton and, after his impeachment and acquittal, many felt the allegation had nowhere to go. Many reporters had encountered the story while it was being disseminated by Republican activists and felt they had already looked into it. Jack Nelson, Washington bureau chief of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, said &quot;This is a story that&#x27;s been knocked down and discredited so many times ... [E]veryone&#x27;s taken a slice of it, and after looking at it, everyone&#x27;s knocked it down. The woman has changed her story about whether it happened. It just wasn&#x27;t credible.&quot; Julia Malone, a Cox Communications reporter, became frustrated by what she perceived as media neglect of the story and held a National Press Club panel on the issue entitled &quot;Too Hot for a &#x27;Scandal-Weary&#x27; New Media to Handle?&quot; Sam Donaldson of ABC News said he was frustrated over his fellow reporters&#x27; unwillingness to press Clinton to respond to the allegations: Clinton refused to comment when Donaldson asked about the allegations, and no one else would press the issue.

Judgement on the Broaddrick matter has varied among book-length treatments of the Bill Clinton years. While Christopher Hitchens&#x27; 1999 book, &quot;No One Left to Lie To&quot;, argued that Broaddrick&#x27;s claim was credible and shows similarities to Paula Jones&#x27; later allegation of sexual harassment, Michael Isikoff&#x27;s book, &quot;Uncovering Clinton&quot;, said that Clinton&#x27;s lawyers figured that he might well have had consensual, extramarital sex with Broaddrick, but they did not believe he would have forced himself on her, and Joe Conason and Gene Lyons&#x27; 2004 book &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot; argued that Broaddrick&#x27;s claim is not credible, noting that the FBI had found evidence for the allegations inconclusive.

==Aftermath==
Broaddrick filed a lawsuit against Clinton in December 1999 to obtain documents that the White House may have gathered about her, claiming its refusal to accede to her demand for such documents violated the Privacy Act of 1974. Her lawyer was conservative judicial activist Larry Klayman, head of conservative activist group Judicial Watch. The suit was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. in March 2001. The judge ruled that the Privacy Act did not apply in this case and that Broaddrick had failed to show evidence that the U.S. Department of Justice had improperly released documents about her.

During that time Broaddrick&#x27;s business was audited by the IRS, which she claimed was retaliation: &quot;I do not believe this was coincidence,&quot; Broaddrick declared, &quot;I do not think our number just came up.&quot;

As Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign in the 2000 United States Senate election in New York unfolded, Broaddrick published an open letter to her, denouncing her alleged role in covering for her husband&#x27;s alleged attack.

The Broaddricks divorced in 2004. David Broaddrick had opposed her going public with her rape story in 1999. Juanita Broaddrick said she also developed a fear of enclosed spaces as a result of what happened.

In 2008 Broaddrick sold her nursing home business and retired, having done well as a businesswoman. She continues to live in Van Buren, on a 23-acre ranch.

==Renewed attention during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign==
Broaddrick resurrected her rape claims on Twitter during the United States presidential election of 2016, as Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee for president.

In this context, the Broaddrick case has often brought about unease on the part of people who are generally supportive of the Clintons. In an October 2016 recap of the case, Dylan Matthews of Vox said: &quot;The basic answer is that some of the claims [against Bill Clinton] appear more credible than others. There are three main accusers [the others being Jones and Willey], of whom it seems by far the most credible—based on the publicly available evidence—is Broaddrick.&quot; Matthews continues: &quot;Given the prevailing view among many progressives—including Hillary Clinton—that one should default to believing rape accusers, the Broaddrick allegation thus poses a problem.&quot; Michelle Goldberg of &quot;Slate&quot; wrote in a late 2015 essay, &quot;our rules for talking about sexual assault have changed since the 1990s, when these women were last in the news. Today, feminists have repeatedly and convincingly made the case that when women say they&#x27;ve been sexually assaulted, we should assume they&#x27;re telling the truth. Particularly when it comes to Broaddrick, it&#x27;s not easy to square the arguments against believing her with the dominant progressive consensus on trusting victims. This is a tension that people on the right are eager to exploit.&quot;

Many conservative commentators who were typically quite skeptical of sexual assault claims without firm evidence, found Broaddrick&#x27;s allegations quite believable. As Katie J. M. Baker of BuzzFeed News lamented, &quot;In theory, partisan politics shouldn&#x27;t play a role in determining whether an alleged rape victim deserves to be heard.&quot; Similar observations have been made by Robby Soave of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine.

The now-retired NBC reporter who broadcast her story, Lisa Myers, said: &quot;No one can objectively look at Juanita&#x27;s story and not be troubled. One of the things that makes her so credible is who she is—open, straightforward, seemingly guileless.&quot;

When in late 2015, during a town hall event during her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton was asked about the allegation, and she responded: &quot;Well, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.&quot;

In January 2016, Broaddrick shared on the social networking site Twitter, &quot;I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73. ... it never goes away.&quot; Broaddrick said she was neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but she supported the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign: &quot;He says the things I like to hear.&quot; She agreed with Trump&#x27;s injection of Bill Clinton&#x27;s acknowledged and alleged sexual misdeeds into the campaign. Although she voted for George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 elections, in the 2008 presidential election she voted for Barack Obama and gave $3,000 to his campaign because he was running against Hillary Clinton. As the election progressed, she increasingly aligned herself with conservative actions and views.

On October 8, 2016, in the wake of controversy over the Donald Trump &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape, Trump retweeted Broaddrick&#x27;s tweets in which she calls Bill Clinton a &quot;rapist&quot; and calls Hillary Clinton&#x27;s actions &quot;horrific&quot;. On October 9 Broaddrick appeared on a panel with Trump, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey (a fourth woman at the panel, Kathy Shelton, had an unrelated grievance against Hillary Clinton) an hour before the second debate between Trump and Clinton in the general election portion of the United States presidential election debates, 2016. Broaddrick and the others were also in the audience during the debate, as was Bill Clinton, although debate organizers kept them in separate areas. The Trump campaign said it had paid for Broaddrick&#x27;s travel to the debate.

==#MeToo and further commentary in 2017–2018==
In 2017, in the wake of Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Broaddrick criticized 1990s Bill Clinton paramour Monica Lewinsky for aligning herself with the #MeToo movement, saying, &quot;I have always felt sad for you, but where were you when we needed you?&quot; Broaddrick added, &quot;I always felt she was a victim. I only wish she had spoken up in &#x27;99 when I was going through so much persecution after my interview on &quot;NBC Dateline&quot;.&quot;

Other discussions of the allegations against Clinton also appeared, including those from Broaddrick. Matthews wrote that &quot;America&#x27;s ongoing national reckoning with sexual assault and sexual harassment by powerful men now has liberals and Democrats reconsidering the legacy of one of the party&#x27;s most important figures of the past quarter-century: President Bill Clinton.&quot;

Caitlin Flanagan of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote &quot;Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger, stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s. Juanita Broaddrick reported that ...&quot; before recapping the case. During an NPR interview Flanagan said, &quot;And so there were a series of women throughout the course of his presidency who came forward with accounts of things they said he did to them which really mirror the kinds of things we&#x27;re looking at now in the very worst of the cases. Juanita Broaddrick, most prominently, said that he raped her very violently in a way that is quite like the Harvey Weinstein accusations in terms of the hotel room and the suddenness and the bleak horror of it all.&quot;

Michelle Goldberg wrote an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; entitled &quot;I Believe Juanita&quot;, where she said, &quot;In this #MeToo moment, when we&#x27;re reassessing decades of male misbehavior and turning open secrets into exposes, we should look clearly at the credible evidence that Juanita Broaddrick told the truth when she accused Clinton of raping her. But revisiting the Clinton scandals in light of today&#x27;s politics is complicated as well as painful.&quot;

Following the sexual assault allegations made against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, Broaddrick said, &quot;All victims matter. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re a Democrat or a Republican ... We all have the right to be believed.&quot;

In 2017, Broaddrick said, of women who had accused Trump of sexually assaulting them, &quot;I felt sorry for them. I felt like they had a right to be heard. But I also felt at the same time that they should bear investigation, scrutiny and vetting. I think it&#x27;s only fair for all parties involved.&quot;

In January 2018 Broaddrick self-published a memoir, co-authored by Nick Lulli, with the title &quot;You&#x27;d Better Put Some Ice On That: How I Survived Being Raped By Bill Clinton&quot;.

Following the September 2018 allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation process, Broaddrick stated the allegations made by Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford were &quot;sketchy&quot; and &quot;vague&quot;.

In a 2019 article for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Amanda FitzSimons wrote that Broaddrick had said regarding E. Jean Carroll, who publicly accused Donald Trump of rape, that Carroll had &quot;just wanted attention... When you’ve been raped, you have a persona about you—it’s almost like you can sense it. I don’t have ESP, but you can almost feel their feelings if these things really happened to them.&quot;

== Political activism ==

Since the 2016 election, Broaddrick has been increasingly politically active in support of Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and conservative groups.

<doc id="1300703" wikidata="Q245455" url="?curid=1300703" title="Chromosome 5q deletion syndrome">
<text>Chromosome 5q deletion syndrome is an acquired, hematological disorder characterized by loss of part of the long arm (q arm, band 5q33.1) of human chromosome 5 in bone marrow myelocyte cells. This chromosome abnormality is most commonly associated with the myelodysplastic syndrome.

It should not be confused with &quot;partial trisomy 5q&quot;, though both conditions have been observed in the same family. Diagnosis is achieved through marrow biopsy.

==Presentation==
The 5q-syndrome is characterized by macrocytic anemia, often a moderate thrombocytosis, erythroblastopenia, megakaryocyte hyperplasia with nuclear hypolobation, and an isolated interstitial deletion of chromosome 5. The 5q- syndrome is found predominantly in females of advanced age.

==Causes==
Several genes in the deleted region appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of 5q-syndrome. Haploinsufficiency of RPS14 plays a central role, and contributes to the anemia via both p53-dependent and p53-independent tumor suppressor effects. Other genes at this region include miR-145 and miR-146a, whose deletion is associated with the megakaryocytic dysplasia and thrombocytosis seen in 5q- syndrome; SPARC, which has antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects; and the candidate tumor suppressors EGR1, CTNNA1, and CDC25C.

==Histology==
This syndrome affects bone marrow cells causing treatment-resistant anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes that may lead to acute myelogenous leukemia. Examination of the bone marrow shows characteristic changes in the megakaryocytes. They are more numerous than usual, small and mononuclear. There may be accompanying erythroid hypoplasia in the bone marrow.
==Treatment==
Lenalidomide has activity in 5q- syndrome and is FDA approved for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent anemia due to low or intermediate-1 (int-1) risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) associated with chromosome 5q deletion with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. There are several possible mechanisms that link the haploinsufficiency molecular lesions with lenalidomide sensitivity.

<doc id="1300704" wikidata="Q810024" url="?curid=1300704" title="Basil Davidson">
<text>Basil Risbridger Davidson (9 November 1914 – 9 July 2010) was a British journalist and historian who wrote more than 30 books on African history and politics. According to two modern writers, &quot;Davidson, a campaigning journalist whose first of many books on African history and politics appeared in 1956, remains perhaps the single-most effective disseminator of the new field to a popular international audience&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Basil Davidson was born in Bristol, United Kingdom on 9 November 1914 and left school at 16 and moved to London. In 1938, he gained a job as the Paris correspondent of &quot;The Economist&quot; and later as the diplomatic correspondent of &quot;The Star&quot;. He travelled widely in Italy and Central Europe in the 1930s.

===Wartime service===
Davidson was recruited by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and MI6, D Section. As part of his Mission, he was sent to Budapest, Hungary in December 1939 under the cover of establishing a news service. In April 1941, with the Nazi invasion, he fled to Belgrade, Yugoslavia. In May, he was captured by Italian forces and was later released as part of a prisoner exchange.

From late 1942 to mid-1943, he was chief of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) Yugoslav Section in Cairo, Egypt, where he was James Klugmann&#x27;s supervisor. He parachuted into Bosnia on 16 August 1943, and spent the following months serving as a liaison with the Partisans, as he would describe in his 1946 book, &quot;Partisan Picture&quot;. Davidson moved east into Srem and the Fruška Gora in Yugoslavia. He was nearly captured or killed several times. SOE posted him to Hungarian occupied Bačka to try to organize a rebel movement there, but Davidson found that the conditions were unsuitable and crossed back over the Danube into the Fruška Gora. The Germans encircled the Fruška Gora in June 1944 in a last attempt to liquidate the Partisans there, but Davidson and the others made a narrow escape. After Soviet forces entered into Yugoslavia, Davidson was airlifted out. Davidson had enormous appreciation for the Partisans and the communist leader Josip Broz Tito.

From January 1945 Davidson was liaison officer with partisans in Liguria and Genoa, Italy. He was present for the surrender of the German forces in Genoa on 26–27 April 1945. He finished the war as a lieutenant-colonel and was awarded the Military Cross and was mentioned in despatches on two occasions.

===Africa and writing career===
Davidson returned to journalism after the war. He was employed initially by &quot;The Times&quot; in Paris but was widely considered to have communist sympathies after his wartime role as the Cold War began. He left in 1949 and became the secretary of the pressure-group, the Union of Democratic Control (UDC) and began to work for the left-leaning &quot;New Statesman&quot;. However, the Cold War prevented him from returning to Central Europe and instead Davidson became interested in Africa after being invited to South Africa by trade unionists opposed to Apartheid. He published several articles and books critical of white-rule in South Africa and colonial rule in Africa, passing to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; (1954–57) and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; (1959–62).

He began a career as a popular writer. He published five novels and 30 other books, mainly on African history and politics. These consolidated his reputation in the United Kingdom as one of the leading popular authorities on the continent in the era of independence. His book &quot;Lost Cities of Africa&quot; won the Anisfield-Wolf Award for best book in 1960. From 1969, Davidson was involved in the Anti-Apartheid Movement and eventually became the movement&#x27;s vice-president. He was a strong supporter of Pan-Africanism, especially from the 1980s, and was critical of the white-minority government in Rhodesia and of the American-backed União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) in Angola. He spent long periods in Angola and in Eritrea during its war of independence from Ethiopia. In 1984, Davidson produced an eight-part documentary series for Channel 4 entitled &quot;Africa&quot;.

Although not an academic, Davidson gained a reputation as an authority on African affairs and received a number of honorary positions at universities, including the School of Oriental and African Studies. Davidson also gained honorary degrees from universities in Europe and Africa, as well as a number of civic decorations. In 1976, he won the Medalha Amílcar Cabral. He received honorary degrees from the Open University of Great Britain in 1980, and the University of Edinburgh in 1981. Davidson&#x27;s &quot;Africa&quot; series won the Gold Award from the International Film and Television Festival of New York in 1984. In 2002 he was decorated by the Portuguese president Jorge Sampaio as Grande Oficial da Ordem do Infante D. Henrique.

<text>The Middlesex Canal was a 27-mile (44-kilometer) barge canal connecting the Merrimack River with the port of Boston. When operational it was 30 feet (9.1 m) wide, and 3 feet (0.9 m) deep, with 20 locks, each 80 feet (24 m) long and between 10 and 11 feet (3.0 and 3.4 m) wide. It also had eight aqueducts.

Built from 1793 to 1803, the canal was one of the first civil engineering projects of its type in the United States, and was studied by engineers working on other major canal projects such as the Erie Canal. A number of innovations made the canal possible, including hydraulic cement, which was used to mortar its locks, and an ingenious floating towpath to span the Concord River. The canal operated until 1851, when more efficient means of transportation of bulk goods, largely railroads, meant it was no longer competitive.

In 1967, the canal was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Remnants of the canal still survive and were the subject of a 1972 listing on the National Register of Historic Places, while the entire route, including parts that have been overbuilt, is the subject of a second listing in 2009.

==History==
===Conception===
By 1790, England had thirty years and all of continental Europe&#x27;s many canals to draw on for the experience. In the years after the American Revolutionary War, the young United States began a period of economic expansion away from the coast. American men of influence had always kept an eye on news from Europe, especially from Great Britain, so when in the years from 1790–1794 the British Parliament passed eighty-one canal and navigation acts, American leaders were paying attention.

Because of extremely poor roads, the cost of bringing goods such as lumber, ashes, grain, and fur to the coast could be quite high if water transport was unavailable. Most American rivers were made unnavigable by rapids and waterfalls. Up and down the Atlantic coast, companies were formed to build canals as cheaper ways to move goods between the interior of the country and the coast. Well aware that to stay independent the nation needed to grow strong and develop industries, the news from Europe rekindled a number of previously dropped canal or navigations projects and began discussions leading in the next decades to many others. The year 1790 is credited as the start of the American Canal Age.

In Massachusetts, several ideas were proposed for bringing goods to the principal port, Boston, and connecting to the interior. For about three years there were plans to connect the upper reaches of the Connecticut River, above the falls at Enfield Connecticut, to Boston through a canal to the Charles. Connecticut was believed to rise at similar elevations to the Merrimack River&#x27;s, which could be reached by a string of streams, ponds, lakes, and manmade canals—if the canals were built. In the first two years, rough surveys sought the best route up to the Connecticut Valley; but no route was obviously best, and nobody championed a specific one. A few true believers, but lesser socialites, needed a champion and pestered the Secretary of War, Henry Knox to ignite the project. After the collapse of stocks in early 1793 put paid to a scheme to join the Charles River with Connecticut, championed by Henry Knox, a group of leading Massachusetts businessmen and politicians led by States Attorney General James Sullivan proposed a connection from the Merrimack River to Boston Harbor in 1793. This became the Middlesex (County) Canal system.

The Middlesex Canal Corporation was chartered on June 22, 1793, with a signature by Governor John Hancock, who purchased shares with other political figures including John Adams, John Quincy Adams, James Sullivan, and Christopher Gore. The incorporators were James Sullivan; Oliver Prescott; James Winthrop; Loammi Baldwin; Benjamin Hall; Jonathan Porter; Andrew Hall; Ebenezer Hall; Samuel Tufts Jr.; Willis Hall; Samuel Swan Jr.; and Ebenezer Hall Jr. Sullivan was made the company&#x27;s president; its vice president and eventually chief engineer was Loammi Baldwin, a native of Woburn, who had attended science lectures at Harvard College and was a friend of physicist Benjamin Thompson.

===Construction===
The route of the canal was first surveyed in August 1793. Local lore is that it is on this expedition that Baldwin was introduced to a particular apple variety that now bears his name. The route survey, however, was sufficiently uncertain that a second survey was made in October. Due to discrepancies in their results, Baldwin was authorized by the proprietors to travel to Philadelphia in an effort to secure the services of William Weston, a British engineer working on several canal and turnpike projects in Pennsylvania under contract to the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company. Baldwin&#x27;s application to the Navigation company was successful: Weston was authorized to travel to Massachusetts. In July and August 1794, Weston, accompanied by Baldwin and several of the latter&#x27;s sons surveyed and identified two possible routes for the proposed canal. The proprietors then secured contracts to acquire the land for the canal, some of which was donated by its owners; in sixteen cases the proprietors used eminent domain proceedings to take the land.

The basic plan was for the canal&#x27;s principal water source to be the Concord River at its highest point in North Billerica, with additional water to be drawn as needed from Horn Pond in Woburn. The site where the canal met the Concord River had been the site of a grist mill since the 17th century, which the proprietors purchased along with all of its water rights. From this point, the canal descended six miles to the Merrimack River in East Chelmsford (now western Lowell) and 22 miles to the Charles River in Charlestown.

In late September 1794 ground was broken in North Billerica. Work on the canal was performed by a number of contractors. In some instances, local workers were contracted to dig sections, while in other areas contract labor was brought in from Massachusetts and New Hampshire for the construction work. A variety of engineering challenges were overcome, leading to innovations in construction materials and equipment. A form of hydraulic cement (made in part from volcanic materials imported at great expense from Sint Eustatius in the West Indies) was used to make the stone locks watertight. Because of its cost and the cost of working in stone, a number of the locks were made of wood instead. An innovation was made in earth-moving equipment with the development of a precursor of the dump truck, where one side of the carrier was hinged to allow the rapid dumping of material at the desired location.

Water was diverted into the canal in December 1800, and by 1803 the canal was filled to Charlestown. The first boat operated on part of the canal on April 22, 1802.

===Merrimack canals===
A variety of enterprises by all or a few of &quot;the proprietors of the Middlesex Canal&quot; which were the corporations&#x27; principal stockholders and the board came together with other third parties or acted in a few cases as a combined whole to fund the development of other stretches of the canal up the Merrimack above Chelmsford. By the completion of construction between Medford and Chelmsford, several extensions envisioned all along were also nearing completion. The whole system was complete in 1814, and with just a few exceptions, overall came to operate with prices and regulations as set by the proprietors of the (main) Middlesex Canal. The following extensions opened up the balance of the Merrimack River to the New Hampshire capital, Concord, which acted as a staging point for riverine traffic deep into the river system penetrating the White and Green Mountains of New Hampshire and Vermont respectively.

===Operation===
By 1808 the completed canal had reached Merrimack, New Hampshire, from the Charles (the downstream terminus) and was carrying two-thirds of the down freight and one-third of the up freight to Western New Hampshire and Eastern Vermont. The other direction, the canal ran from&quot; &#x27;Middlesex Village&#x27; &quot;or East Chelmsford, Massachusetts (The Town of Chelmsford was later divided and East Chelmsford was renamed Lowell, Massachusetts, now the fourth most populous city in Massachusetts, primarily because of the Lowell textile industry spawned by the transportation infrastructure and water power along the Middlesex Canal and the Nashua and Merrimack Rivers), through several sparser settled Middlesex County outlier suburbs such as Billerica, and Tewksbury, then closer-in suburban towns with the lower course running towards Boston generally along water courses nearly paralleling the routes of MA 38 from Wilmington, thence in Woburn along the Aberjona River from Horn Pond through Winchester (or &quot;Waterfield&quot;) into the Mystic Lakes and down the Mystic River between Arlington and Somerville on the west bank and Medford along the east (left) bank, until the river and canal ran into the Boston Harbor tidewater in the Charlestown basin.

At first, it terminated in Medford, but was later extended to Charlestown, Massachusetts, with a branch near Medford Center to the Mystic River. Over time, the canal was connected to by a series of other canal companies, and many of those were owned in part by the canal proprietors, which constructed spurs up through New Hampshire upstream along the Nashua and Merrimack Rivers, enabling freight to be transported as far inland as Concord, New Hampshire. Within two years of commencing operations, regular boat traffic operated by independent companies was reaching upriver over . Three main companies operated on the canal system. The water source for the canal was the Concord River at North Billerica. This was also the highest point of the canal and is the present location of the Middlesex Canal Association&#x27;s museum.

Freight boats required 18 hours from Boston up to Lowell, and 12 hours down, thus averaging 2.5 miles per hour; passenger boats were faster, at 12 and 8 hours, respectively (4 miles per hour). As seen on later American canals, use was not restricted to freight and transit: people from the city would ride passenger boats on daylong tourism excursions to the countryside and take vacations in luxuriously fitted out canal boats, whole families spending a week or two lazing along the waterways in the heat of summer.

Freight statistics compiled for twenty years cited in the Harvard Economic study by Roberts indicate the downriver trips from Concord to Boston took four days, and the reverse trip upriver took on average five days. A round trip between Boston and Concord, New Hampshire, usually took 7–10 days. These speed limits were set and maintained by the board of proprietors to prevent wakes from damaging the canal sides. Roberts noted they were unlikely to be enforced, and generation of a shore damaging wake would require sails or animals to drive a canal boat in excess of , which would require dangerously stiff breezes in the correct direction.

The canal was one of the main thoroughfares in eastern New England until a few decades after the advent of the railroad. The Boston and Lowell Railroad (now a part of the MBTA Commuter Rail system) was built using the plans from the original surveys for the canal. Portions of the line follow the canal route closely, and the canal was used to transport construction materials and also an engine for the railroad.

The canal was no longer economically viable after the introduction of railroad competition, and the company collected its last tolls in 1851. The Middlesex Turnpike, incorporated in 1805, also contributed to its downfall. Investors who held their shares in the company lost money: shareholders invested a total of $740 per share but only reaped $559.50 in dividends. Those who sold their shares at an appropriate time made money: shares valued at $25 in 1794 reached a value of $500 in 1804 and were worth $300 in 1816.

Before the corporation was dissolved, the proprietors proposed to convert the canal into an aqueduct to bring drinking water to Boston, but this effort was unsuccessful. After the canal ceased operation its infrastructure quickly fell into disrepair. In 1852 the company ordered dilapidated bridges over the canal torn down and the canal underneath filled in. Permission was given for the company to liquidate and pay the proceeds to the stockholders, and its 1793 charter was revoked in 1860. The company&#x27;s records were given over to the state for preservation. The canal corporation&#x27;s land and dam in North Billerica, as well as the water rights on the Concord River, were sold to Charles and Thomas Talbot, who erected the Talbot Mills complex that now stands in the Billerica Mills Historic District.

Parts of the canal bed were covered by roads in the 20th century, including parts of the Mystic Valley Parkway in Medford and Winchester, and parts of Boston Avenue in Somerville and Medford. Boston Avenue crosses the Mystic River where the canal did. Parts of the canal in eastern Somerville were filled in by leveling Ploughed Hill in the late 19th century. Ploughed Hill was the site of notorious anti-Catholic riots in 1832 and had subsequently been abandoned.

===Impact===
The opening of the canal diminished the commercial viability of the port of Newburyport, Massachusetts, the outlet of the Merrimack River, since all trade from the Merrimack Valley in New Hampshire now went via the canal to Boston, rather than through the sometimes difficult to navigate river.

The canal also played a prominent role in the eventual growth of Lowell as a major industrial center. Its opening brought on a decline in business at the Pawtucket Canal, a transit canal opened in the 1790s which bypassed the Pawtucket Falls just downstream from the Middlesex Canal&#x27;s northern end. Its owners converted the Pawtucket Canal for use as a power provider, leading to the growth of the mill businesses on its banks beginning in the 1820s. The Middlesex Canal was used for the transport of raw materials, finished goods, and personnel to and from Lowell.

The canal&#x27;s use of the Concord River had significant long-term environmental consequences. The raising of the dam height at North Billerica was believed to cause flooding of seasonal hay meadows upstream and prompted numerous lawsuits against the canal proprietors. These were all ultimately unsuccessful, due in part to the uncertainty of the science, and also in part to the political power of the proprietors. As the canal was in decline in its later years, the state legislature finally ordered the dam height to be lowered, but then repealed the order before it was executed. Analysis done in the 20th century suggests that the dam, which still stands (although no longer at its greatest height), probably had a flooding effect on hay meadows as far as 25 miles up the watershed. Many of these meadows had to be abandoned, and some now form portions of the Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge; they are classified as wetlands.

The canal featured a number of innovations and was referred to as an example for later engineering projects. The use of hydraulic cement to mortar the locks is the first known use of the material in North America. The route was surveyed using a Wye level (an early version of a dumpy level), again the first recorded use in America. At North Billerica, where the canal met the Concord River at the millpond, a floating towpath was devised to handle the needs of crossing traffic patterns.

==Today==
Though significant portions of the Middlesex Canal are still visible, urban and suburban sprawl is quickly overcoming many of the remains. The Middlesex Canal Association, founded in 1962, has erected markers along portions of the canal&#x27;s path. Prominent portions of the canal that are still visible include water-filled portions in Wilmington, Billerica, and near the Baldwin House in Woburn. Dry walkable sections can be found in Winchester, most notably a section at the Mystic Lakes where an aqueduct was situated, and Wilmington, where aqueduct remnants are also visible in the town park off Route 38. Most of the canal south of Winchester has been overbuilt by roads and residential construction, although traces may still be discerned in a few places.

In 1967 the canal was designated a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark (one of the first such designations made) by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The surviving elements of the canal are the subject of a 1972 listing on the National Register of Historic Places, while the entire route, including parts that have been overbuilt, is the subject of a second listing in 2009.

The Middlesex Canal Association maintains a museum in North Billerica, Massachusetts, at the Faulkner Mills. Directions and additional information are available on the Middlesex Canal Association website.

<text>Irofulven or 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (also known as HMAF of MGI-114) is an experimental antitumor agent. It belongs to the family of drugs called alkylating agents.

It inhibits the DNA replication of cells deficient in nucleotide excision repair in culture.

Irofulven is an analogue of illudin S, a sesquiterpene toxin found in the Jack &#x27;o&#x27; Lantern mushroom (&quot;Omphalotus illudens&quot;). The compound was originally synthesized by Dr. Trevor McMorris and found to have anticancer properties in mice by Dr. Michael J Kelner.
==Licensing and Clinical development==

The drug was created and patented by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and subsequently licensed to the US biotech company MGI Pharma. Eisai acquired MGI in 2007, and the license was returned to UCSD, which then re-licensed the potential cancer drug to Lantern Pharma in 2015. Soon after, the drug was again sub-licensed to Oncology Venture, now known as Allarty Therapeutics A/S.

The drug has undergone a number of clinical trials, mostly for late-stage tumors as well as ovarian and prostate cancers, usually preceded by treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel. A multi-center phase 2 trial involving patients with Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer was well tolerated but irofluven demonstrated modest activity as a single agent. Previously, a European Phase I study in combination with cisplatin showed substantial evidence for anti-tumor activity. In that study, irofulven showed rapid elimination and high interpatient variability. Platinum and irofulven pharmacokinetics did not suggest drug-drug interactions.

Despite modest successes demonstrating limited efficacy for late stage tumors that were statistically not significant enough to support broader clinical trials, Allarty decided to stratify patient populations with companion diagnostic tools (biomarkers) to predict outcomes, and thus select that sub-set of patients through DRP (Drug Response Predictors), for whom treatment with irofulven would be most effective. Allarty initiated two Phase 2 drug-screening studies at two Danish University Hospitals for late-stage prostate cancers, wherein 300 patients have been included to be screened, of which only 27 are to be selected for the Phase 2 trial.In 2021, Lantern Pharma reacquired the rights to the development and commercialization of irofulven. At that time, 9 of the intended 27 patients had been a part of the study which saw an increase of median overall survival from 2.6 to 5.4 months. The study was still ongoing as of late 2024.

Since it was first synthesized, research with irofulven has decreased dramatically over the past decade with only one clinical trial currently being run. A study published in 2021 showed cells with nucleotide excision repair (NER) deficiencies were susceptible to iroflaven while cells without these NER deficiencies were not overly affected. The deficiency of tumors in NER was seen as a potential identifier for patient candidates. Since this discovery, research has increased with researchers calling irofulven a &quot;previously abandoned&quot; anticancer drug.

==Synthesis==
A synthesis of irofulven has been reported.

<text>The Bhonsle (or Bhonsale, Bhosale, Bhosle) are a prominent group within the Maratha clan system.

==History==
=== Earliest members ===
The earliest accepted members of the Bhonsles are Mudhoji Bhonsle and his kin Rupaji Bhonsle, who were the village headman (pāṭīl) of Hingani — this branch has been since known as Hinganikar Bhonsles. A branch seem to have split soon, who went on to claim an ancestral right to the post of district steward (deśmukhī) of Kadewalit: Suryaji Bhonsle during the reign of Ahmad Nizam Shah I (early 1490s), and his son Sharafji Bhonsle during the conquest of the region by Daniyal Mirza (1599). This branch has been since known as Kadewalit Bhonsles.

The next significant Bhonsle was probably Maloji Bhosale from the Hinganikar branch. He was the great-grandson of one Kheloji (c. 1490).

=== Origins ===
In the opinion of Jadunath Sarkar and other scholars, Bhonsles were predominantly Deccani tiller-plainsmen from the Shudra caste; they were part of the Marathas/Kunbis, an amorphous class-group. Scholars have however disagreed about the agricultural status of Bhosles. Rosalind O&#x27;Hanlon notes that the historical evolution of castes grouped under the Maratha-Kunbis is sketchy. Ananya Vajpeyi rejects the designation of Shudra, since the category has remained in a state of flux across centuries; she instead notes them to be a Marathi lineage, who enjoyed &quot;reasonably high&quot; social status as landholders and warlords, being in the service of Deccan Sultanate or Mughals.

According to R. C. Dhere&#x27;s interpretation of local oral history and ethnography, Bhonsles descend from the Hoysalas and Yadavas of Devagiri, who were cow-herding Gavli sovereigns. In early thirteenth century, &quot;Baliyeppa Gopati Sirsat&quot;, a Hoysala cousin of Simhana migrated from Gadag to Satara along with his pastoral herd and kul-devta; the Sambhu Mahadev was thus installed at a hill-top in Singhnapur. Historical records indicate that this shrine received extensive patronage from Maloji onwards. Further, there exists a branch of the Bhosles named &quot;Sirsat Bhosles&quot; and Bhosle (or &quot;Bhosale&quot;) is linguistically similar to &quot;Hoysala&quot;. M. K. Dhavalikar found the work to convincingly explain the foundation of the Bhosle clan (as well as Sambhu Mahadev cult). Vajpeyi too advocates that Dhere&#x27;s theory be probed in greater detail — &quot;[f]rom pastoralist big men to warlords on horseback, is not an impossible distance to cover in two to three centuries.&quot;

==== Shivaji and his claim of Rajput origin ====
By 1670s, Shivaji had acquired extensive territory and wealth from his campaigns. But, lacking a formal crown, he had no operational legitimacy to rule his &quot;de facto&quot; domain and technically, remained subject to his Mughal (or Deccan Sultanate) overlords; in the hierarchy of power, Shivaji&#x27;s position remained similar to fellow Maratha chieftains. Also, he was often opposed by the orthodox Brahmin community of Maharashtra. A coronation sanctioned by the Brahmins was thus planned, in a bid to proclaim sovereignty and legitimize his rule.

On proposing the Brahmins of his court to have him proclaimed as the rightful king, a controversy erupted: the regnal status was reserved for those belonging to the kshatriya varna. Not only was there a fundamental dispute among scholars on whether any true Kshatriya survived in the Kali Yuga, having been all destroyed by Parashurama but also Shivaji&#x27;s grandfather was a tiller-headman, Shivaji did not wear the sacred thread, and his marriage was not in accordance with the Kshatriya customs. Thus, the Brahmins had him categorised as a shudra.

Compelled to postpone his coronation, Shivaji had his secretary Balaji Avji Chitnis sent to the Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar for inspection of the royal genealogies; Avji returned with a favorable finding — Shahji turned out to be a descendant of Chacho Sisodiya, a half-Rajput uncle of Mokal Singh. Gaga Bhatt, a famed Brahmin of Banaras, was then hired to ratify Chitnis&#x27; find, and the Bhonsles were now permitted to stake a claim to Kshatriya caste. The coronation would be re-executed in June 1674 but only after going through a long list of preludes.

Led by Bhatt, who employed traditional Hindu imagery in an unprecedented scale, the first phase had Shivaji penance for having lived as a Maratha despite being a Kshatriya. Then came the sacred thread ceremony (&#x27;maunjibandhanam&#x27;) followed by remarriage according to Rajput customs (&#x27;mantra-vivah&#x27;) and a sequence of Vedic rituals before the eventual coronation (&#x27;abhisheka&#x27;) — a public spectacle of enormous expense that heralded the rebirth of Shivaji as a Kshatriya king. Panegyrics composed by court-poets during these spans (and afterward) reinforced onto the public memory that Shivaji (and the Bhonsles) indeed belonged from the Sisodiyas.

However, the Kshatriyization was not unanimous; a section of Brahmins continued to deny the Kshatriya status. Brahmins of the Peshwa period rejected Bhatt&#x27;s acceptance of Shivaji&#x27;s claims and blamed the non-dharmic coronation for all ills that plagued Shivaji and his heirs—in tune with the general Brahminical sentiment to categorize all Marathas as Shudras, carte-blanche; there have been even claims that Bhatt was excommunicated by Maratha Brahmins for his role in the coronation of Shivaji! Interestingly, all claims to Rajput ancestry had largely vanished from the family&#x27;s subsequent projections of identity.

====Accuracy====
Vajpeyi notes the &quot;veridical status&quot; of Chitnis&#x27; finds to be not determinable to &quot;historical certainty&quot; — the links were tenuous at best and inventive at worst. According to some claims, Shivaji was a Rajput of the Sisodia Rajput clan while other claims say that he was a Kunbi Maratha and the sole purpose of the lineage claim as a Rajput was to guarantee Shivaji&#x27;s consecration as a Kshatriya, in a tactic that had clear parallels to Rajputisation. Jadunath Sarkar deemed that the genealogy was cleverly fabricated by Balaji Awji and after some reluctance accepted by Gaga Bhatt, who in turn was &quot;rewarded with a huge fee&quot;. V. K. Rajwade, Dhere, Allison Busch, John Keay and Audrey Truschke also agree with Sarkar about the fabrication. G. S. Sardesai notes that the descent is &quot;not authentically proved&quot;. Stewart N. Gordon does not pass any judgement but notes Bhatt to be a &quot;creative Brahmin&quot;. André Wink deems that the Sisodia genealogical claim is destined to remain disputed forever.

=== Princely States ===
Satara State, Kolhapur State, Thanjavur State, Nagpur State, Akkalkot State, Sawantwadi State and Barshi were amongst the prominent states ruled by the Bhonsles.
