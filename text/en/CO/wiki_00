<text>Academic dishonesty, academic misconduct, academic fraud and academic integrity are related concepts that refer to various actions on the part of students that go against the expected norms of a school, university or other learning institution. Definitions of academic misconduct are usually outlined in institutional policies. Therefore, academic dishonesty consists of many different categories of behaviour, as opposed to being a singular concept.

==History==
Academic dishonesty dates back to the first tests. Scholars note that cheating was prevalent on the Chinese civil service exams thousands of years ago, even when cheating carried the penalty of death for both examinee and examiner. Bribery of examiners was also common, as represented in works such as the Ming-dynasty story collection &quot;The Book of Swindles&quot;.

Standards for citation and referencing began at the end of the 19th century with the emergence of guidance provided by scholarly societies that developed discipline-specific expectations for referencing such as the MLA and the APA. About the same time, scholars began researching issues related to cheating, with some early research dating back to the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, when cheating was identified as a widespread problem at college campuses in the United States. It has been estimated that as many as two-thirds of students cheated at some point of their college careers at the turn of the 20th century. Fraternities often operated so-called essay banks, where term papers were kept on file and could be resubmitted over and over again by different students, often with the only change being the name on the paper. The issue of academic dishonesty became more prominent in the latter half of the twentieth century, as universities shifted towards more democratic approaches to admission.

==Today==
Academic dishonesty does not have a universal definition. Educational institutions in different regions understand and act on academic dishonesty in different ways. Much like many other areas of student affairs, academic integrity also boasts organizations that help students, faculty and staff of postsecondary institutions discuss and understand the values of academic integrity such as the International Centre for Academic Integrity (ICAI). Multiple institutions, such as the University of Waterloo, Queen&#x27;s University, University of Colorado and York University base their culture of academic integrity on ICAI&#x27;s 6 fundamental values (honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage).

=== United States ===
In the United States, one study has shown that 20 percent of students started cheating in the first grade. Similarly, other studies reveal that currently in the U.S., 56 percent of middle school students and 70 percent of high school students have cheated. Students are not the only ones to cheat in an academic setting. A study among North Carolina school teachers found that 35 percent of respondents said they had witnessed their colleagues cheating in one form or another. The rise of high-stakes testing and the consequences of the results on the teacher is cited as a reason why a teacher might want to inflate the results of their students.

The first scholarly studies in the 1960s of academic dishonesty in higher education found that nationally in the U.S., somewhere between 50 and 70 percent of college students had cheated at least once. While nationally, these rates of cheating in the U.S. remain stable today, there are large disparities between different schools, depending on the size, selectivity, and anti-cheating policies of the school. Generally, the smaller and more selective the college, the less cheating occurs there. For instance, the number of students who have engaged in academic dishonesty at small elite liberal arts colleges can be as low as 15–20 percent, while cheating at large public universities can be as high as 75 percent. Moreover, researchers have found that students who attend a school with an honor code are less likely to cheat than students at schools with other ways of enforcing academic integrity. As for graduate education, a recent study found that 56 percent of MBA students admitted cheating, along with 54 percent of graduate students in engineering, 48 percent in education, and 45 percent in law.

There is also a great difference in students&#x27; perceptions and the reality of their own ethical behavior. In a 2008 survey of 30,000 students in high school carried out by the Josephson Institute for Youth Ethics, 62 percent of students polled said they &quot;copied another&#x27;s homework two or more times in the past year.&quot; Yet, on the same survey, 92 percent said they were &quot;satisfied with their personal ethics and character.&quot;

As more students take courses and assessments online, there is a persistent perception that it is easier to cheat in an online class than a face-to-face course. Moreover, there are online services that offer to prepare any kind of homework of high school and college level and take online tests for students. While administrators are often aware of such websites, they have been unsuccessful in curbing cheating in homework and non-proctored online tests, resorting to a recommendation by the Ohio Mathematics Association to derive at least 80 percent of the grade of online classes from proctored tests. In addition, colleges and universities are increasingly turning to online proctoring services to oversee tens of thousands of exams per year.

While research on academic dishonesty in other countries is less extensive, anecdotal evidence suggests cheating could be even more common in countries like Japan.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency addresses academic dishonesty.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the Quality Assurance Agency is responsible for quality assurance in higher education. It has produced several policy and guidance documents for policy makers, educators and the general public.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, individual post-secondary institutions discourage academic misconduct with the help of policies and guidelines published by the university itself, though research into the topic has lagged behind that of other countries. Research has shown that the incidence of academic dishonesty in Canada is similar to that of the United States. While many institutions are guided by ICAI, there also exists provincial organizations, such as the Academic Integrity Council of Ontario (AICO). Handling cases of academic dishonesty was mainly done using the rule compliance approach, which was more punitive in nature. However, more and more institutions are now adopting the integrity approach, which is based on a more educational and restorative model.

=== Germany ===
A large-scale study in Germany found that 75 percent of the university students admitted that they conducted at least one of seven types of academic misconduct (such as plagiarism or falsifying data) within the previous six months.

==Types==

===Cheating===

Cheating can take the form of cheat sheets, looking over someone&#x27;s shoulder during an exam, or any forbidden sharing of information between students regarding an exam or exercise. Many elaborate methods of cheating have been developed over the years. For instance, students have been documented hiding cheat sheets or notes in the bathroom toilet tank, in the brims of their baseball caps, up their sleeves, along their thighs or in their cleavage. Also, the storing of information in graphing calculators, pagers, cell phones, and other electronic devices has cropped up since the information revolution began. While students have long surreptitiously scanned the tests of those seated near them, some students actively try to aid those who are trying to cheat. Methods of secretly signalling the right answer to friends are quite varied, ranging from coded sneezes or pencil tapping to high-pitched noises beyond the hearing range of most teachers. Some students have been known to use more elaborate means, such as using a system of repetitive body signals like hand movements or foot jerking to distribute answers (i.e. where a tap of the foot could correspond to answer &quot;A&quot;, two taps for answer &quot;B&quot;, and so on).

One other method is taking advantage of time zones, particularly in exams administered worldwide. Those who take the exam first (likely in Oceania) can then post answers for those about to take the exam (in a time zone behind like Europe).

===Impersonation===

Impersonation is a form of cheating whereby a different person than the student assigned an assignment or exam completes it. Attending a class or completing an interview on another student&#x27;s behalf is also considered impersonation. The academic work is totally &#x27;outsourced&#x27; to another person or organization, usually for pay.

====Contract cheating====

Contract cheating, also known as ghostwriting is similar to impersonation in that a student hires a third party to complete work on their behalf. Essay mills fall under this category. While it is believed that contract cheating has significantly increased since 2014, there are currently no figures to demonstrate this surge. This is a relatively new form of cheating, seemingly gaining traction in the 1940s when an increasing amount of advertisements for ghostwriters could be seen on university campuses and in newspapers. This trend continued to grow into the 1960s and 1970s. According to a study conducted in 2019, it is estimated that the ghostwriting industry produces a revenue of approximately $100 million.

=== Plagiarism ===

Plagiarism, as defined in the 1995 &quot;Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary&quot;, is the &quot;use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one&#x27;s own original work&quot;. In academia, this can range from borrowing without attribution a particularly apt phrase, to paraphrasing someone else&#x27;s original idea without citation, to wholesale contract cheating.

Europe developed the modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal in the 18th century, while in the previous centuries authors and artists were encouraged to &quot;copy the masters as closely as possible&quot; and avoid &quot;unnecessary invention&quot;. The 18th century new morals were institutionalized and enforced prominently in the sectors of academia (including academic science, education, engineering etc.) and journalism, where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics, subject to sanctions like expulsion and other severe career damages. Not so in the arts, which have resisted in their long-established tradition of copying as a fundamental practice of the creative process. As of the 21st century, artists continue to tolerate plagiarism.

Plagiarism is not a crime but is disapproved more on the grounds of moral offence.

Since 2000, discussions on the subjects of student plagiarism have increased with a major strand of this discussion centering on the issue of how best students can be helped to understand and avoid plagiarism. Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism.

Also under the scope of plagiarism is self-plagiarism. Self-plagiarism occurs when a student submits an assignment, essay, or piece of work that was originally submitted for another course without the instructor&#x27;s permission to do so.

Tomar and Chan concluded that students with access to AI-generated websites such as ChatGPT are more likely to plagiarize their assignments and claim the work from the websites as their own. Because ChatGPT generates human-like text, it can increase actions of ghostwriting, such as students using direct information from their sources without giving proper citations. In an article published by &quot;Intelligent.com&quot;, Dr. Ronnie Gladden argued that &quot;In essence, originality and rigor absolutely matter. And critical consciousness and independent thought must be fostered, and I will fiercely defend those elements.&quot;

Cebrián-Robles discussed the risks of using AI tools in academia, such as the need to monitor online activity, as well as the struggle between academic honesty and AI. According to a survey done by the Chalmers University of Technology, &quot;62 percent [of students] believe that using chatbots during examinations is cheating.&quot;

=== Sabotage ===
In the academic context, sabotage occurs when one commits acts to disrupt another person&#x27;s work with the intention of preventing them from completing it successfully. Examples include disrupting another person&#x27;s research, destroying important documents and also hacking computers used for research.

=== Abuse of confidentiality ===
This takes place when data or results from research or a piece of academic work is disseminated or shared while the author(s) expectation was for them to remain confidential.

=== Aiding and abetting ===
Aiding and abetting is the act of helping, enabling or encouraging someone to engage or attempt to engage in any act of academic dishonesty.

=== Improper research practices ===

Improper research practices involve fabricating, misrepresenting or selectively reporting research data as well as not giving proper credit to authors or researchers when reporting results of their work.

==Causes==
There are a variety of causes of academic misconduct. Researchers have studied the correlation of cheating to personal characteristics, demographics, contextual factors, methods of deterring misconduct, even stages of moral development. There is some evidence in research to suggest that individuals with &quot;type A&quot; personalities who often attempt to obtain high degrees of success, are most likely to be reported on for academic misconduct (cheating).

===Incentives to cheat===
Some scholars contend that there are students who have a pathological urge to cheat. The writer Thomas Mallon noted that many scholars had found plagiarism in literature (Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Reade being two notable examples) to often be perpetrated in a way similar to kleptomania (a psychological disease associated with uncontrollable stealing, even when it is against the interests of the thief). On the other hand, Mallon concludes it is probable that most &quot;cheaters&quot; make a rational choice to commit academic misconduct. A common reason for unethical behavior is the desire to &quot;gain a competitive advantage in the race for position or power&quot;.

Richard Fass puts forward the possibility that business scandals in the real world make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society. Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. For some students, there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: &quot;It is not that we love honesty less, but that we love success more.&quot; Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any. However, it has been shown that the expected benefits of cheating as well as student&#x27;s morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.

There have been studies that have looked into success and academic dishonesty; one study showed that students given an unexpected opportunity to cheat did not improve their grades significantly from the control group. Another study showed that students who were allowed to bring cheat sheets to a test did not improve their grades. While this may conflict with the common perception of cheating (one survey found that only 13% of males and 46% of females think cheating does not help grades).

In the US, William Bowers reported that, on average, one third of grade A students cheated in 1964. And asserts that academic dishonesty acts as a shortcut, so even grade A students might be tempted to cheat. He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.

====Teachers====
The federal government of the United States has mandated high-stakes testing as part of the No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law in 2002. Schools and teachers are held accountable for the results. According to Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, co-authors of &quot;Freakonomics&quot;, teachers are known to &quot;teach to the test&quot;: while not teaching the actual answers, they teach the questions and similar ones, and they neglect any topic that will not be tested on. Levitt also states that teachers may inflate the results of tests given in their classroom. Teachers and librarians can have a significant proactive impact on doing honest work.

===Demographic and personal causes===
Research has identified a number of demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating, including age, gender and grade point average. Older students, females, and students with higher academic achievement are less likely to cheat, whereas students involved with many extra-curricular activities are more likely to do so. Students involved in extra-curricular activities may be less committed to their studies, or may have more demands on their time, which interfere with their studies, creating a greater incentive to cheat. It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat: one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during sophomore year at college. Although cheating might be expected to decline with greater moral development, one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a morality test and their likelihood of cheating (that is, students at a pre-conventional stage of morality are as likely to cheat as those at a post-conventional stage). Higher academic procrastination was also found to increase the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct (using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, and fabrication or falsification of data) as well as the variety of academic misconduct.

Race, nationality, and class all show little correlation with academic misconduct. There is also no correlation between how religious someone is and the likelihood that the person will cheat. A comparison between students of different religions yielded similar results, although the study did show that Jews tend to cheat less than members of other religions. One of the strongest demographic correlations with academic misconduct in the United States is with language. Students who speak English as a second language have been shown to commit academic dishonesty more and are more likely to be caught than native speakers, since they will often not want to rewrite sources in their own words, fearing that the meaning of the sentence will be lost through poor paraphrasing skills. In the University of California system, international students make up 10% of the student body but comprise 47% of academic dishonesty cases. In British universities, students from outside of the European Union make up 12% of the student body but comprise 35% of academic dishonesty cases.

Impostor syndrome and academically dishonest behaviours have been found to be correlated. Students who do not believe they deserve to be where they are in terms of academics actively engage in self-sabotaging behaviour (plagiarism and cheating) in order to prove that they do not belong where they are while students who do not suffer from impostor syndrome are less likely to engage in academic dishonesty.

===Contextual causes===

Contextual factors that individual teachers can affect often make the least difference on cheating behavior. A study found that increasing the distance between students taking an exam has little effect on academic misconduct, and that threatening students before an exam with expulsion if they cheat actually promotes cheating behavior. Indeed, increased exam proctoring and other methods of detecting cheating in the classroom are largely ineffective. According to one survey of American college students, while 50% had cheated at least once in the previous six months, and 7% had cheated more than five times in that period, only 2.5% of the cheaters had been caught. As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating, students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating (sometimes even treating it as a game), leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable arms race. Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior. It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat, probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered. However, if a professor makes clear that they disapprove of cheating, either in the syllabus, in the first class, or at the beginning of a test, academic dishonesty can drop by 12%. Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.

Teachers can, however, accidentally promote cheating behavior. A study found a correlation between how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating as a way of getting back at the teacher. Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when the teacher is using a grade curve, are more likely to cheat. Research has also shown a correlation between goal orientation and the occurrence of academic cheating. Students who perceive their classroom to have high mastery goals are less likely to engage in cheating than those who perceive their classroom to emphasize performance goals.

The most important contextual causes of academic misconduct are often out of individual teachers&#x27; hands. One very important factor is time management. One survey reported two-thirds of teachers believed that poor time management was the principal cause of cheating. Often social engagements are to blame. It has been found that there is a strong correlation between extracurricular activities and cheating, especially among athletes, even those on intramural teams. It has also been found that student cheating rates rise significantly the more time students spend playing cards, watching television, or having a few drinks with friends. Relatedly, fraternity or sorority membership is also strongly correlated with academic misconduct.

One of the most important causes of academic misconduct is the contextual factor of an environment of peer disapproval of cheating, that is, peer pressure. Psychologists note that all people tend to follow the norms of their peer group, which would include norms about academic dishonesty. Thus, students who believe that their peers disapprove of cheating are less likely to cheat. Indeed, multiple studies show that the most decisive factor in a student&#x27;s decision to cheat is his perception of his peers&#x27; relationship with academic dishonesty. For instance, on average 69% of students cheat at colleges with low community disapproval of academic misconduct, whereas only about 23% of students cheat at colleges with strong community disapproval of academic misconduct. Peer pressure works both ways, as a study found that there is a 41% increase in the probability of a student cheating if they have seen someone else cheat. However, even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating, there has to be a community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure. For instance, larger schools, which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools, tend to have a weaker community, being more split up into different peer groups that exert little social pressure on each other. Another measure of a college community, how many students live on campus, further shows a significant relation with a school&#x27;s cheating rate. Relatedly, many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior.

===Ethical causes===
No matter what the demographic or contextual influences are on a student who decides to engage in cheating behavior, before they can cheat they must overcome their own conscience. This depends both on how strongly someone disapproves of academic dishonesty and what types of justifications the student uses to escape a sense of guilt. For instance, students who personally do not have a moral problem with academic misconduct can cheat guilt-free. However, while many students have been taught and have internalized that academic dishonesty is wrong, it has been shown that on average a third of students who strongly disapprove of cheating have in fact cheated. People who cheat despite personal disapproval of cheating engage in something called &quot;neutralization&quot;, in which a student rationalizes the cheating as being acceptable due to certain mitigating circumstances. According to psychologists of deviant behavior, people who engage in neutralization support the societal norm in question, but &quot;conjure up&quot; reasons why they are allowed to violate that norm in a particular case. Neutralization is not a simple case of &quot;ex post facto&quot; rationalization, but is rather a more comprehensive affair, occurring before, during, and after the act of cheating. Researchers have found four major types of neutralization of academic dishonesty, which they categorize by type of justification. &quot;Denial of responsibility&quot; – that is, the accusation that others are to blame or that something forced the student to cheat – is the most common form of neutralization among college students who cheated, with 61% of cheaters using this form of justification. &quot;Condemnation of condemner&quot; – that is, that the professors are hypocrites or brought it on themselves – is the second most common form of college student neutralization at 28%. The third most popular form of neutralization among college students is the &quot;appeal to higher loyalties,&quot; where the student thinks their responsibility to some other entity, usually their peers, is more important than doing what they know to be morally right. About 6.8% of cheaters in higher education use this form of neutralization. &quot;Denial of injury&quot; – thinking that nobody is worse off for the cheating – is the fourth most popular kind of neutralization at 4.2% of cheaters.

=== Cultural considerations ===
Many studies have revealed that academic honesty is not a universal concept. Some cultures accept the memorization and regurgitation of information, without citing sources, while others would consider this plagiarism. Additionally, some cultures believe that knowledge belongs to everyone and that this knowledge needs to be shared. Studies have shown that in certain Asian cultures, it is more important to share information widely than to properly cite the owner of this knowledge.

=== COVID-19 and academic dishonesty ===
Cases of academic dishonesty have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the sudden transition from in-person to online course delivery, instructors (who may have been engaging in the same evaluation practices for years) did not have the opportunity to consider how to deliver online evaluations, how they differ from in-person evaluations and what the online process entails. The sharing of academic files, contract cheating and the unauthorized receipt of assistance from classmates and other sources have increased due to the transition to online course delivery.

==Effects==

Students who engage in neutralization to justify cheating, even once, are more likely to engage in it in the future, potentially putting them on a road to a life of dishonesty. One study found that students who are dishonest in class are more likely to engage in fraud and theft on the job when they enter the workplace.

Academic dishonesty also creates problems for teachers. In economic terms, cheating causes an underproduction of knowledge, where the professor&#x27;s job is to produce knowledge. Moreover, a case of cheating often will cause emotional distress to faculty members, many considering it to be a personal slight against them or a violation of their trust. Dealing with academic misconduct is often one of the worst parts of a career in education, one survey claiming that 77% of academics agreed with the statement &quot;dealing with a cheating student is one of the most onerous aspects of the job&quot;.

Ultimately, academic dishonesty undermines the academic world. It interferes with the basic mission of education, the transfer of knowledge, by allowing students to get by without having to master the knowledge. Furthermore, academic dishonesty creates an atmosphere that is not conducive to the learning process, which affects honest students as well. When honest students see cheaters escape detection, it can discourage student morale, as they see the rewards for their work cheapened. Cheating also undermines academia when students steal ideas. Ideas are a professional author&#x27;s &quot;capital and identity&quot;, and if a person&#x27;s ideas are stolen it retards the pursuit of knowledge.

If never formally retracted, fraudulent publications can remain an issue for many years as articles and books remain on shelves and continue to be cited. The case of S. Walter Poulshock, a 1960s early-career historian whose work was found to contain wholly fabricated material, was exposed in 1966 with the &quot;American Historical Review&quot; providing a warning on the topic. Nonetheless, his book was never removed from the shelves of many university libraries and (together with his related thesis) was still being cited in 2013, 47 years after it was intended to have been withdrawn by its publisher.

==Deterrence==

Historically, the college professor was considered to act &quot;in loco parentis&quot;, and was therefore permitted to regulate student behavior as a parent.

===Honor codes===

First at the College of William and Mary in 1779, and then followed by schools like the University of Virginia in the 1850s and Wesleyan University in 1893, the students, with the agreement of faculty who declared themselves dedicated to ideals of democracy and human character, created honor codes. B. Melendez of Harvard University defined an honor code as a code of academic conduct that includes a written pledge of honesty that students sign, a student controlled judiciary that hears alleged violations, unproctored examinations, and an obligation for all students help enforce the code.

===Mixed judicial boards===
However, many people doubted the advisability of relying on an abstract notion of honor to prevent academic dishonesty. This doubt has perhaps led to the reality that no more than a quarter of American universities have adopted honor codes. Moreover, many professors could not envisage a student run trial process that treated faculty accusers fairly. In response to these concerns, in the middle of the twentieth century, many schools devised mixed judicial panels composed of both students and faculty. This type of academic integrity system was similar to the traditional faculty control system in that it relied on professors to detect cheating, except in this system cheaters were brought before centralized boards of students and faculty for punishment. By the 1960s over a quarter of American universities had adopted this system of mixed judicial boards.

===Student due-process rights===
Starting in the 1960s, the U.S. Supreme Court began chipping away at the &quot;in loco parentis&quot; doctrine, giving college students more civil liberties such as the right of due process in disciplinary proceedings (&quot;Dixon v. Alabama Board of Education,&quot; 1961).

===Modified honor codes===
Recently, Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, two experts in the field of academic dishonesty, have proposed a new way of deterring cheating that has been implemented in schools such as the University of Maryland. Modified honor codes put students in charge of the judicial hearing process, making it clear that it is the students&#x27; responsibility to stop cheating amongst themselves, but at the same time students still have proctored exams and are not allowed to take pledges of good conduct in place of professor oversight. The researchers who advocate this type of code seem to think that the normal honor code is something of a special case that is not applicable to many schools. According to supporters of this system, schools with a large student body, a weak college community, or no history of student self-governance will not be able to support a full honor code. However, while modified honor codes seem to be more effective than faculty or administration run integrity codes of conduct, research shows that schools with modified codes still have higher rates of cheating than schools with full honor codes.

===Comparison of different systems of enforcement===
Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between forms of academic integrity system and levels of cheating at a school. Several studies have found students who attend schools with honor codes are less likely to cheat than students at schools with traditional integrity codes. Another study found that only 28% of schools with honor codes have high levels of cheating, whereas 81% of schools with mixed judicial boards have high rates of cheating. Whereas faculty or administration run codes of conduct tend to rely on policing and punishment to deter students from cheating, honor codes tend to rely on and cultivate student senses of honor and group peer pressure to deter academic misconduct.

===Faculty issues in deterring academic dishonesty===
There are limitations to relying on the faculty to police academic dishonesty. One study found that up to 21% of professors have ignored at least one clear cut case of cheating. Another study revealed that 40% of professors &quot;never&quot; report cheating, 54% &quot;seldom&quot; report cheating, and that a mere 6% act on all cases of academic misconduct that confront them. A third survey of professors found that while 79% had observed cheating, only 9% had penalized the student. According to a manual for professors on cheating,
the reasons for this lack of action include unwillingness to devote time and energy to the issue, reluctance to undergo an emotional confrontation, and fear of retaliation by the student, of losing students, of being accused of harassment or discrimination, and even of being sued for these offenses and/or defamation of character.
There are other reasons as well. Some professors are reluctant to report violations to the appropriate authorities because they believe the punishment to be too harsh. Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.

Under the ironic gaze of postmodernism, the distinctions between guilt and innocence, integrity and deceit permeating the scandal debates appear irrelevant.&quot; However, there is an argument that postmodernism is just moral relativism, therefore cheating is condoned as a valid academic method, even if it is morally and legally wrong. One professor wrote in an article in &quot;The English Journal&quot; that when he peeked in on an unproctored class taking a test and saw several students up and consulting with one another, he decided that they were not cheating, but were using non-traditional techniques and collaborative learning to surmount the obstacles teachers had put in their way. Issues of cultural relativism also affect professors&#x27; views on cheating; the standard objection being that &quot;students from certain Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures are baffled by the notion that one can &#x27;own&#x27; ideas, since their cultures regard words and ideas as the property of all rather than as individual property&quot;. Another issue teachers may have with deterring cheating is that they may decide that it is not their job. The argument that &quot;they&#x27;re professors, not policemen&quot; is often heard in academia. In economic terms, some professors believe they are being paid to provide learning, and if the student loses that learning through cheating, they are only cheating themselves out of the money they have paid for their education.

<text>The Church of World Messianity (), abbreviated COWM, is a Japanese new religion founded in 1935 by Mokichi Okada.

Its headquarters in Atami, Shizuoka is called the ().

==History==
In 1926, Okada claimed to have received a divine revelation that empowered him to be a channel of God&#x27;s Healing Light (&quot;johrei&quot;) to purify the spiritual realm to remove the spiritual causes of illness, poverty, and strife from the world and inaugurate a new Messianic Age. He went on to teach Johrei to his followers to allow them to achieve Messianity and spread the teachings across the world. Members are given permission to channel Johrei by wearing an O-Hikari pendant containing a copy of one of Mokichi Okada&#x27;s calligraphies. He is often referred to as &quot;Meishu-Sama&quot; (Lord of Light) by his followers.

Okada&#x27;s teaching is represented by a number of his works, such as Foundation of Paradise and &quot;Johrei: Divine Light of Salvation&quot;, which has been edited and translated by the Society of Johrei, an offshoot of COWM.

Yoshikazu Okada, the founder of the Mahikari religion, was originally a follower of Sekai Kyūsei Kyō (Church of World Messianity).

==Beliefs and practices==
There are three pillars of the religion, of which the key concept is Johrei, claimed to be a method of channeling divine light into the body of another for the purposes of healing. Other formal practices include the Art of Nature which includes nature farming, and the Art of Beauty which includes practices such as Ikebana (Japanese flower arranging).

The &quot;god&quot; of Sekai Kyūseikyō is .

According to anthropologist of religion Winston Davis, Mahikari groups are comparable to The Church of World Messianity and follow basically the same healing ritual.

==Demographics==
The movement currently claims 800,000 followers, including many in Brazil. , also known as &quot;Shumei&quot;, also follows the teachings of Okada and is considered a descendant of the church by CFAR.

=== In Brazil ===
Japanese Brazilians are the largest concentration of people of Japanese descent outside Japan. According to Hideaki Matsuoka of the University of California, Berkeley, in a presentation at the Summer 2000 Asian Studies Conference Japan entitled &quot;Messianity Makes the Person Useful: Describing Differences in a Japanese Religion in Brazil,&quot; Japanese new religions have propagated in Brazil since the 1930s and now have at least a million non-Japanese Brazilian followers. Four major religions ranked by the number of followers are Seicho-no-Ie, Messianity, Sukyo Mahikari, and PL Kyodan.

In Brazil, Guarapiranga is the sacred place of the Church of World Messianity ().

==Museums==
The Church of World Messianity operates two art museums.

* in Shinsenkyō (神仙郷), founded in 1952
* in Zuiunkyō (瑞雲郷), founded in 1982

Shinji Shumeikai (also known simply as Shumei), a splinter organization of the Church of World Messianity, operates the Miho Museum in Kōka, Shiga. The museum also serves as the organization&#x27;s headquarters.

==Organizations==
The Church of World Messianity consists of a coalition of three organizations:
*Sekai Kyūseikyō Izunome Kyōdan 世界救世教いづのめ教団 (or &quot;Izunome&quot;)
*Sekai Kyūseikyō Tōhō no Hikari Kyōdan 世界救世教東方之光教団 (or &quot;Tōhō no Hikari&quot;)
*Sekai Kyūseikyō Su no Hikari Kyōdan 世界救世教主之光教団 (or &quot;Su no Hikari&quot;)

<text>was a popular and prolific Japanese AV idol. She appeared in over 100 movies, appearing in up to ten releases per month. She was murdered at the age of 24.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Nozomi Momoi was born in Tokyo on September 23, 1978. She attended junior high school in Nagano Prefecture, and remained in touch with friends there, visiting them on vacation, for the rest of her life. Before beginning work in the AV field, Nozomi worked in what she called &quot;a very normal job.&quot; Describing her daily routine at this time, she said, &quot;I used to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to get ready for work and I didn&#x27;t have time to put on make-up or do my hair... It was the type of job where I was alone most of the time so I didn&#x27;t bother with it.&quot; She wanted a different lifestyle, and to make more money, but she was unable to decide what sort of work she wanted to do. She was in this frame of mind when she was scouted by a representative of the AV industry in Tokyo&#x27;s Shinjuku neighborhood.

===AV debut===
When she made her AV debut in April 2001 with Dogma, AV director Tohjiro&#x27;s advice to Nozomi was, &quot;You should be a bit more perverted.&quot; Nozomi claimed that she took this advice to heart and that it helped her to be less inhibited both on screen and off. In December of her debut year, Nozomi was the star of the fourth entry in VIP studios&#x27; documentary-style &quot;Monthly&quot; series. 
Her January 2002 video for the Media Station Bazooka label, &quot;Virtual Brothel&quot;, had Nozomi playing the role of a young prostitute who learns the trade from the more experienced Yukari Sakurada. Viewers were invited to compare Sakurada&#x27;s veteran technique with Nozomi&#x27;s fresh innocence.

Nozomi enjoyed her new occupation. About her early videos, Nozomi recalled, &quot;I was having so much fun at first that I didn&#x27;t feel tired at all.&quot; Unlike many AV actresses who are happy to have time off, Nozomi became known for actively seeking out new chances to perform. In May 2002, Nozomi appeared in the third entry of the &quot;Forceful Exhibitionistic-Play Maniax&quot; video series. In this video, Nozomi and two other AV actresses engage in exhibitionistic acts at a pachinko parlor, a public park, and an office building.

===Later career===
Towards the end of her life, she had become tired of the rape themes and school-girl roles which were common in her videos, but she enjoyed the fact that she was getting more dominant roles in her later AVs. &quot;Making men play along to me is something new so it&#x27;s fun to do. I think that&#x27;s the type of thing I want to do more of.&quot; Nozomi&#x27;s July, 2002 video release, &quot;Popular Actresses Fucking Virgin Boys&quot;, was in this genre. As the title implied, the video had Nozomi and two other AV actresses have sex with amateur virgin males, including a college student and a middle-aged man. Her video &quot;Home Delivery Call Girl&quot;, from August 2002, worked with a similar documentary-style concept. In this case, the actress appears at a male amateur&#x27;s home to perform sex with him. A posthumously-released compilation DVD released by CineMagic from 2006, entitled &quot;La Vie En Nose&quot;, includes one of Nozomi&#x27;s videos from 2002. This was the first in a series of DVDs focusing on a nose fetish, indicating that Nozomi had worked in that genre also.

Nozomi continued to enjoy sex both within and outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, &quot;...it was a lot of fun at first, but I&#x27;m really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I&#x27;m over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid.&quot; She continued, &quot;Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it&#x27;s hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!&quot; A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.

===Death===
Nozomi&#x27;s career was still on the rise when her life came to a sudden end while visiting Nagano Prefecture. On October 12, 2002, she was found dead by the Narai River, which runs through Shiojiri. A nearby burned-out car contained the remains of her male companion. Nozomi had been stabbed at least six times, covered with gasoline and set on fire about 10 meters from the car. It was reported that Nozomi&#x27;s companion was a company employee in Nagano Prefecture, and that in what the police called a possible murder-suicide pact, the man had burned himself to death inside the car. The remains were so badly charred that it took hours of testing before investigators could even determine that the remains belonged to a male. According to the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;, &quot;Nozomi seemed to have something Japan&#x27;s myriad other porno starlets lacked and, at just 24, she was on her way up in the world before her tragic end.&quot;

In the months after the incident, the parents of Momoi&#x27;s male companion objected to the murder-suicide theory and many inconsistencies were pointed out. His parents unsuccessfully brought a case against the local police and when their insurance company refused to pay because of their son&#x27;s supposed suicide, they sued Sumitomo Life Insurance. In October 2006, the civil court at Nagano ruled in favor of the parents that the two deaths were due to murder by a third party. No further progress had been made in the criminal case.

<doc id="1265393" wikidata="Q1773926" url="?curid=1265393" title="Congo Crisis">
<text>The Congo Crisis () was a period of political upheaval and conflict between 1960 and 1965 in the Republic of the Congo (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The crisis began almost immediately after the Congo became independent from Belgium and ended, unofficially, with the entire country under the rule of Joseph-Désiré Mobutu. Constituting a series of civil wars, the Congo Crisis was also a proxy conflict in the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union and the United States supported opposing factions. Around 100,000 people are believed to have been killed during the crisis.

A nationalist movement in the Belgian Congo demanded the end of colonial rule: this led to the country&#x27;s independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as federalism, tribalism, and ethnic nationalism, remained unresolved. In the first week of July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing white citizens. Katanga and South Kasai seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisers and other support.

The involvement of the Soviets split the Congolese government and led to an impasse between Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Mobutu, at that time Lumumba&#x27;s chief military aide and a lieutenant-colonel in the army, broke this deadlock with a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, expelled the Soviet advisors and established a new government effectively under his own control. Lumumba was taken captive and subsequently executed in 1961. A rival government of the &quot;Free Republic of the Congo&quot; was founded in the eastern city of Stanleyville by Lumumba supporters led by Antoine Gizenga. It gained Soviet support but was crushed in early 1962. Meanwhile, the UN took a more aggressive stance towards the secessionists after Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash in late 1961. Supported by UN troops, Léopoldville defeated secessionist movements in Katanga and South Kasai by the start of 1963.

With Katanga and South Kasai back under the government&#x27;s control, a reconciliatory compromise constitution was adopted and the exiled Katangese leader, Moïse Tshombe, was recalled to head an interim administration while fresh elections were organised. Before these could be held, however, Maoist-inspired militants calling themselves the &quot;Simbas&quot; rose up in the east of the country. The Simbas took control of a significant amount of territory and proclaimed a communist &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo&quot; in Stanleyville. Government forces gradually retook territory and, in November 1964, Belgium and the United States intervened militarily in Stanleyville to recover hostages from Simba captivity. The Simbas were defeated and collapsed soon after. Following the elections in March 1965, a new political stalemate developed between Tshombe and Kasa-Vubu, forcing the government into near-paralysis. Mobutu mounted a second coup d&#x27;état in November 1965, taking personal control of the country. Under Mobutu&#x27;s rule, the Congo (renamed Zaire in 1971) was transformed into a dictatorship which would endure until his deposition in 1997.

==Background==

===Belgian rule===

Colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, frustrated by Belgium&#x27;s lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government&#x27;s ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.

Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the &quot;colonial trinity&quot; (&quot;trinité coloniale&quot;) of state, missionary and private company interests. The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that capital sometimes flowed back into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied and the state helped companies with strikebreaking and countering other efforts by the indigenous population to better their lot. The country was split into nesting, hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set &quot;native policy&quot; (&quot;politique indigène&quot;)—in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. There was also a high degree of racial segregation. Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum, but were nonetheless always treated as superior to black people.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a &quot;model colony&quot;. One of the results of the measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African &quot;évolués&quot; in the cities. By the 1950s, the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony. The Congo&#x27;s rich natural resources, including uranium—much of the uranium used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese—led to substantial interest in the region from both the Soviet Union and the United States as the Cold War developed.

===Politics and radicalisation===
An African nationalist movement developed in the Belgian Congo during the 1950s, primarily among the &quot;évolués&quot;. The movement was divided into a number of parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another. The largest, the &quot;Mouvement National Congolais&quot; (MNC), was a united front organisation dedicated to achieving independence &quot;within a reasonable&quot; time. It was created around a charter which was signed by, among others, Patrice Lumumba, Cyrille Adoula and Joseph Iléo, but others accused the party of being too moderate. Lumumba became a leading figure within the MNC, and by the end of 1959, the party claimed to have 58,000 members.
The MNC&#x27;s main rival was the &quot;Alliance des Bakongo&quot; (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who advocated a more radical ideology than the MNC, based around calls for immediate independence and the promotion of regional identity. ABAKO&#x27;s stance was more ethnic nationalist than the MNC&#x27;s; it argued that an independent Congo should be run by the Bakongo as inheritors of the pre-colonial Kingdom of the Kongo. The &quot;Confédération des Associations Tribales du Katanga&quot; (CONAKAT), a localist party led by Moïse Tshombe, was the third major organisation; it advocated federalism and primarily represented the southern province of Katanga. These were joined by a number of smaller parties which emerged as the nationalist movement developed, including the radical &quot;Parti Solidaire Africain&quot; (PSA), and factions representing the interests of minor ethnic groups like the &quot;Alliance des Bayanzi&quot; (ABAZI).

Although it was the largest of the African nationalist parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate &quot;évolués&quot; and the more radical mass membership. A radical faction headed by Iléo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party&#x27;s support base into those who remained with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, which became most popular around the southern city of Élisabethville and among the Luba ethnic group.

Major riots broke out in Léopoldville, the Congolese capital, on 4 January 1959 after a political demonstration turned violent. The &quot;Force Publique&quot;, the colonial gendarmerie, used force against the rioters—at least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500. The nationalist parties&#x27; influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the &quot;évolué&quot; class into the independence movement. Many blacks began to test the boundaries of the colonial system by refusing to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations. The bulk of the ABAKO leadership was arrested, leaving the MNC in an advantageous position.

These developments led to the white community also becoming increasingly alarmed. Some whites looked to a possible military government to restore order while others petitioned the colonial government for crackdowns. As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed militia groups known as &quot;Corps de Voluntaires Européens&quot; (&quot;European Volunteer Corps&quot;) to police their neighborhoods, but these militias were outlawed on March 25.

=== Independence ===

In the fallout from the Léopoldville riots, the report of a Belgian parliamentary working group on the future of the Congo was published. It noted a strong demand for &quot;internal autonomy&quot;. August de Schryver, the Minister of the Colonies, launched a high-profile Round Table Conference in Brussels in January 1960, with the leaders of all the major Congolese parties in attendance. Lumumba, who had been arrested following riots in Stanleyville, was released in the run-up to the conference and headed the MNC-L delegation. The Belgian government had hoped for a period of at least 30 years before independence, but Congolese pressure at the conference led to 30 June 1960 being set as the date. Delegates failed to reach an agreement concerning the issues of federalism, and the future role of Belgium in Congolese affairs.

Belgians began campaigning against Lumumba, whom they wanted to marginalise; they accused him of being a communist and, hoping to fragment the nationalist movement, supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT. Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the French Community or Britain&#x27;s Commonwealth of Nations, and that close economic and political association with Belgium would continue. As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in an MNC relative majority.

The proclamation of the independent Republic of the Congo, and the end of colonial rule, occurred as planned on 30 June 1960. In a ceremony at the &quot;Palais de la Nation&quot; in Léopoldville, King Baudouin gave a speech in which he presented the end of colonial rule in the Congo as the culmination of the Belgian &quot;civilising mission&quot; begun by Leopold II. After the King&#x27;s address, Lumumba gave an unscheduled speech in which he angrily attacked colonialism and described independence as the crowning success of the nationalist movement. Although Lumumba&#x27;s address was acclaimed by figures such as Malcolm X, it nearly provoked a diplomatic incident with Belgium; even some Congolese politicians perceived it as unnecessarily provocative. Nevertheless, independence was celebrated across the Congo.

Politically, the new state had a semi-presidential constitution, known as the &quot;Loi Fondamentale&quot;, in which executive power was shared between president and prime minister in a system known as &quot;bicephalisme&quot;. Kasa-Vubu was proclaimed president, and Lumumba prime minister, of the Republic of the Congo. Despite the objections of CONAKAT and others, the constitution was largely centralist, concentrating power in the central government in Léopoldville, and did not devolve significant powers to provincial level.

==Beginning of the crisis==

===&quot;Force Publique&quot; mutiny, racial violence and Belgian intervention===
Despite the proclamation of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial institutions like the &quot;Force Publique&quot; to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements. Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.
Lieutenant-General Émile Janssens, the Belgian commander of the &quot;Force Publique&quot;, refused to see Congolese independence as marking a change in the nature of command. The day after the independence festivities, he gathered the black non-commissioned officers of his Léopoldville garrison and told them that things under his command would stay the same, summarising the point by writing &quot;Before Independence = After Independence&quot; on a blackboard. This message was hugely unpopular among the rank and file—many of the men had expected rapid promotions and increases in pay to accompany independence. On 5 July 1960, several units mutinied against their white officers at Camp Hardy near Thysville. The insurrection spread to Léopoldville the next day and later to garrisons across the country.

Rather than deploying Belgian troops against the mutineers as Janssens had wished, Lumumba dismissed him and renamed the &quot;Force Publique&quot; the &quot;Armée Nationale Congolaise&quot; (ANC). All black soldiers were promoted by at least one rank. Victor Lundula was promoted directly from sergeant-major to major-general and head of the army, replacing Janssens. At the same time, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, an ex-sergeant-major and close personal aide of Lumumba, became Lundula&#x27;s deputy as army chief of staff. The government attempted to stop the revolt—Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu intervened personally at Léopoldville and Thysville and persuaded the mutineers to lay down their arms—but in most of the country the mutiny intensified. White officers and civilians were attacked, white-owned properties were looted and white women were raped. The Belgian government became deeply concerned by the situation, particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees. The international press expressed shock at the apparent sudden collapse of order in the Congo, as the world view of the Congolese situation prior to independence—due largely to Belgian propaganda—was one of peace, stability, and strong control by the authorities.
Lumumba&#x27;s stance appeared to many Belgians to justify their prior concerns about his radicalism. On 9 July, Belgium deployed paratroopers, without the Congolese state&#x27;s permission, in Kabalo and elsewhere to protect fleeing white civilians. The Belgian intervention divided Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu; while Kasa-Vubu accepted the Belgian operation, Lumumba denounced it and called for &quot;all Congolese to defend our republic against those who menace it.&quot; At Lumumba&#x27;s request, white civilians from the port city of Matadi were evacuated by the Belgian Navy on 11 July. Belgian ships then bombarded the city; at least 19 civilians were killed. This action prompted renewed attacks on whites across the country, while Belgian forces entered other towns and cities, including Léopoldville, and clashed with Congolese troops. The Belgian government subsequently announced that it would provide for Belgian bureaucrats back in the metropole, triggering an exodus of most of the Congo&#x27;s 10,000 European civil servants and leaving the administration in disarray. Engulfed by the disorder spreading throughout the country, most of the government ministries were unable to function.

===Katanga and South Kasai secessions===
On 11 July 1960, Moïse Tshombe, the leader of CONAKAT, declared the Congo&#x27;s southern province of Katanga independent as the State of Katanga, with Élisabethville as its capital and himself as president. The mineral-rich Katanga region had traditionally shared closer economic ties with the Copperbelt of neighbouring Northern Rhodesia (then part of the Central African Federation) than with the rest of the Congo, and because of its economic importance it had been administered separately from the rest of the country under the Belgians. CONAKAT furthermore contended that Katangese people were ethnically distinct from other Congolese. The secession was partly motivated by the Katangese separatists&#x27; desire to keep more of the wealth generated by the province&#x27;s mining operations and to avoid sharing it with the rest of the Congo. Another major factor was what CONAKAT held to be the disintegration of law and order in the central and north-eastern Congo. Announcing Katanga&#x27;s breakaway, Tshombe said &quot;We are seceding from chaos.&quot;
The major mining company in Katanga, the (UMHK), had begun supporting CONAKAT during the latter days of Belgian rule amid worries that the MNC might seek to nationalise the company&#x27;s assets after independence. UMHK was largely owned by the , a prominent holding company based in Brussels that had close ties to the Belgian government. Encouraged by the UMHK, the Belgian government provided military support to Katanga and ordered its civil servants in the region to remain in their posts. Tshombe also recruited mercenaries, mainly whites from South Africa and the Rhodesias, to supplement and command Katangese troops. Although supported by the Belgians, Katanga never received formal diplomatic recognition from any country. The Katangese secession highlighted the &quot;fundamental weakness&quot; of the central government in Léopoldville, which had been the chief advocate of a unified state.

Less than a month after the Katangese secession, on 8 August, a section of Kasai Province situated slightly to the north of Katanga also declared its autonomy from the central government as the Mining State of South Kasai () based around the city of Bakwanga. South Kasai was much smaller than Katanga, but was also a mining region. It was largely populated by the Luba ethnic group, and its president, Albert Kalonji, claimed that the secession was largely sparked by persecution of the Baluba in the rest of the Congo. The South Kasai government was supported by , another Belgian mining company, which received concessions from the new state in return for financial support. Without control over Katanga and South Kasai, the central government was deprived of approximately 40 percent of its revenues.

===Foreign reaction and UN intervention===
Disquiet about Belgium&#x27;s support for the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, believed that the crisis would provide the organisation with a chance to demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.
The arrival of the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) was initially welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. ONUC&#x27;s initial mandate, however, only covered the maintenance of law and order. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskjöld refused to use UN troops to assist the central Congolese government against them; he argued that doing so would represent a loss of impartiality and breach Congolese sovereignty. Lumumba also sought the assistance of the United States government of Dwight D. Eisenhower, which refused to provide unilateral military support. Frustrated, he turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed in the Congo. Lumumba&#x27;s actions distanced him from the rest of the government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa.

With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, but during the course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. and perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.

The involvement of the Soviet Union alarmed the United States. The American government under Eisenhower, in line with Belgian criticism, had long believed that Lumumba was a communist and that the Congo could be on track to become a strategically placed Soviet client state. In August 1960, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents in the region reported to their agency that &quot;Congo [is] experiencing [a] classic communist ... takeover&quot; and warned that the Congo might follow the same path as Cuba.

==Political disintegration==

===Central government split and first Mobutu coup===
Lumumba&#x27;s appeal for Soviet support split the government and led to mounting pressure from Western countries to remove him from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, whom they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, to move against Lumumba&#x27;s centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance.

On 5 September 1960, Kasa-Vubu announced on national radio that he had unilaterally dismissed Lumumba, using the massacres in South Kasai as a pretext and with the promise of American backing. Andrew Cordier, the American UN representative in the Congo, used his position to block communications by Lumumba&#x27;s faction and to prevent a coordinated MNC-L reaction to the news. Both chambers of Parliament, however, supported Lumumba and denounced Kasa-Vubu&#x27;s action. Lumumba attempted to dismiss Kasa-Vubu from his position, but could not get support for this, precipitating a constitutional crisis. Ostensibly in order to resolve the deadlock, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu launched a bloodless coup and replaced both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba with a College of Commissionaires-General (&quot;Collège des Commissaires-généraux&quot;) consisting of a panel of university graduates, led by Justin Bomboko. Soviet military advisors were ordered to leave. Allegedly, the coup was intended to force the politicians to take a cooling-off period before they could resume control. In practice, however, Mobutu sided with Kasa-Vubu against Lumumba, who was placed under house arrest, guarded by Ghanaian UN troops and an outer ring of ANC soldiers. Kasa-Vubu was re-appointed President by Mobutu in February 1961. From the coup onwards, Mobutu was able to exert considerable power in Congolese politics behind the scenes.
Following Kasa-Vubu&#x27;s reinstatement, there was an attempted rapprochement between the Congolese factions. Tshombe began negotiations for the end of the secession and the formation of a confederal Congo. Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.

Members of the MNC-L fled to Stanleyville where, led by Antoine Gizenga, they formed a rebel government in November 1960 in opposition to the central government in Léopoldville. The Gizenga government was recognised by some states, including the Soviet Union and China, as the official government of the Congo and could call on an approximate 5,500 troops compared to the central government&#x27;s 7,000. Faced with UN pressure, the Gizenga government however collapsed in January 1962 after Gizenga was arrested.

===Killing of Lumumba===

Lumumba escaped house arrest and fled eastwards towards Stanleyville where he believed he could rally support. Pursued by troops loyal to Mobutu, he was captured at Lodi on 1 December 1960 and flown back to Léopoldville with his hands bound. Despite UN appeals to Kasa-Vubu for due legal process, the Soviet Union denounced the UN as responsible for the arrest and demanded his release. A meeting of the UN Security Council was called on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba&#x27;s immediate release, his restoration to the head of the Congolese government and the disarming of Mobutu&#x27;s forces. The pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8–2. Still in captivity, Lumumba was tortured and transported to Thysville and later to Katanga, where he was handed over to forces loyal to Tshombe. On 17 January 1961, Lumumba was executed by Katangese troops near Élisabethville.

News of the execution, released on 13 February, provoked international outrage. The Belgian Embassy in Yugoslavia was attacked by protesters in Belgrade, and violent demonstrations occurred in London and New York. Shortly thereafter seven Lumumbists, including the first President of Orientale Province, Jean-Pierre Finant, were executed in South Kasai for &quot;crimes against the Baluba nation&quot;. Gizenga&#x27;s soldiers then shot 15 political prisoners in retaliation, including Lumumba&#x27;s dissident Minister of Communications, Alphonse Songolo.

===United Nations escalation and the end of the Katangese secession===
Since its initial resolution of July 1960, the UN had issued further resolutions calling for the total withdrawal of Belgian and mercenary forces from Katanga in progressively stronger terms. By 1961, ONUC comprised nearly 20,000 men. Although their mandate prevented them from taking sides, ONUC had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them. In September 1961, an attempt to detain a group of Katangese mercenaries without violence during Operation Morthor went wrong and turned into a fire-fight. ONUC&#x27;s claim to impartiality was undermined in mid-September when a company of Irish UN troops were captured by numerically superior Katangese forces following a six-day siege in Jadotville. Katanga proceeded to hold the Irishmen as prisoners of war, a development that deeply embarrassed the UN mission and its proponents.
On 18 September 1961, Hammarskjöld flew to Ndola, just across the border in Northern Rhodesia, to attempt to broker a cease-fire between UN and Katangese forces. His aircraft crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and everybody else on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld&#x27;s attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated American support for the UN mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-Empain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation. In April 1962, UN troops occupied South Kasai. On the night of 29/30 September 1962, South Kasai military commanders launched a coup d&#x27;état in Bakwanga against the Kalonjist regime. On 5 October 1962, central government troops again arrived in Bakwanga to support the mutineers and help suppress the last Kalonjist loyalists, marking the end of South Kasai&#x27;s secession.
Resolution 169, issued in November 1961, called for ONUC to respond to the deteriorating human rights situation and prevent the outbreak of full-scale civil war. The resolution &quot;completely rejected&quot; Katanga&#x27;s claim to statehood and authorised ONUC troops to use all necessary force to &quot;assist the Central Government of the Congo in the restoration and maintenance of law and order&quot;. The Katangese made further provocations and, in response, ONUC launched Operation Unokat to dismantle Katangese roadblocks and seize strategic positions around Élisabethville. Faced with international pressure, Tshombe signed the Kitona Declaration in December 1961 in which he agreed in principle to accept the authority of the central government and state constitution and to abandon any claim to Katangese independence. Following the declaration, however, talks between Tshombe and Adoula reached a deadlock, while Katangese forces continued to harass UN troops. Diminishing support and Belgium&#x27;s increasing reluctance to support Katanga demonstrated that the state could not survive indefinitely. On 11 December 1962, Belgian foreign minister Paul-Henri Spaak declared that the Belgian government would support the UN or the central Congolese government should they attempt to end the Katangese secession through force.

On 24 December 1962, UN troops and the Katangese Gendarmerie clashed near Élisabethville and fighting broke out. After attempts to reach a ceasefire failed, UN troops launched Operation Grandslam and occupied Élisabethville, prompting Tshombe to leave the country. A ceasefire was agreed upon soon thereafter. Indian UN troops, exceeding their orders, then occupied Jadotville, preventing Katangese loyalists from regrouping. Gradually, the UN overran the rest of the Katanga and, on 17 January 1963, Tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of Kolwezi, effectively ending the Katangese secession.

===Attempted political reconciliation===

Following the end of the Katanga secession, political negotiations began to reconcile the disparate political factions. The negotiations coincided with the formation of an émigré political group, the &quot;Conseil National de Libération&quot; (CNL), by dissident Lumumbists and others in neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. The negotiations culminated in the creation of a new, revised constitution, known as the Luluabourg Constitution, after the city in which it was written, to create a compromise balance of power. The new constitution increased the power of the presidency, ending the system of joint consultation between president and prime minister, and appeased federalists by increasing the number of provinces from six to 21 while increasing their autonomy. The constitution also changed the name of the state from the Republic of the Congo to Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was ratified in a constitutional referendum in June 1964 and Parliament was dissolved to await new elections. Kasa-Vubu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim prime minister. Although personally capable, and supported as an anti-communist by Western powers, Tshombe was denounced by other African leaders such as King Hassan II of Morocco as an imperialist puppet for his role in the Katangese secession.

Under Tshombe&#x27;s interim government, fresh elections were scheduled for 30 March and the rebellion broke out in the central and eastern parts of the Congo.

==Kwilu and Simba rebellions==

The period of political crisis had led to widespread disenchantment with the central government brought in by independence. Demands for a &quot;second independence&quot; from kleptocracy and political infighting in the capital grew. The &quot;second independence&quot; slogan was taken up by Maoist-inspired Congolese revolutionaries, including Pierre Mulele who had served in the Lumumba government. The political instability of the Congo helped to channel wider discontentment into outright revolt.
Disruption in the rural Congo begun with agitation by Lumumbists, led by Mulele, among the Pende and Mbundu peoples. By the end of 1963, there was unrest in regions of the central and eastern Congo. The Kwilu Rebellion broke out on 16 January 1964 in the cities of Idiofa and Gungu in Kwilu Province. Further disruption and uprisings then spread to Kivu in the east and later to Albertville, sparking further insurrection elsewhere in the Congo and the outbreak of the larger Simba Rebellion. The rebels began to expand their territory and rapidly advance northwards, capturing Port-Émpain, Stanleyville, Paulis and Lisala between July and August.

The rebels, who called themselves &quot;Simbas&quot; (from the Kiswahili word for &quot;lion&quot;), had a populist but vague ideology, loosely based on communism, which prioritised equality and aimed to increase overall wealth. Most of the active revolutionaries were young men who hoped that the rebellion would provide them with opportunities which the government had not. The Simbas used magic to initiate members and believed that, by following a moral code, they could become invulnerable to bullets. Magic was also very important to the rebels who also made extensive use of witchcraft to protect themselves and also demoralise their ANC opponents. As they advanced, the rebels perpetrated numerous massacres in the territory they captured in order to remove political opposition and terrorise the population. About 1,000 to 2,000 Westernized Congolese were murdered in Stanleyville alone, while the rebels initially left Whites and foreigners mostly alone. ONUC was in the process of withdrawing when the rebellions started and had only 5,500 personnel, most whom were deployed in the eastern part of the country and stranded by the conflict. Straggling Western missionaries retreated to their respective embassies, which in turn requested UN assistance. A small force of peacekeepers was assembled and subsequently dispatched to the Kwilu region to retrieve fleeing missionaries. Rescue operations continued throughout March and April and resulted in the successful recovery of over 100 missionaries.

The rebels founded a state, the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo (&quot;République populaire du Congo&quot;), with its capital at Stanleyville and Christophe Gbenye as president. The new state was supported by the Soviet Union and China, which supplied it with arms, as did various African states, notably Tanzania. It was also supported by Cuba, which sent a team of over 100 advisors led by Che Guevara to advise the Simbas on tactics and doctrine. The Simba rebellion coincided with a wide escalation of the Cold War amid the Gulf of Tonkin incident and it has been speculated that, had the rebellion not been rapidly defeated, a full-scale American military intervention could have occurred as in Vietnam.

=== Suppression and Belgian and American intervention ===
After its early string of successes, the Simba rebellion began to encounter local resistance as it encroached on areas outside of the MNC-L&#x27;s old domain. The People&#x27;s Republic also suffered from a lack of coherent social and economic policy, contributing to an inability to administer its own territory. From the end of August 1964 the rebels began to lose ground to the ANC. Albertville and Lisala were recaptured in late August and early September. Tshombe, backed by Mobutu, recalled many of his former mercenaries from the Katangese secession to oppose the Simba. Mercenaries, led by &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Hoare and mostly whites from central and southern Africa, were formed into a unit known as 5 Commando ANC. The unit served as the spearhead of the ANC and were involved in unsanctioned killing, torture, looting and rapes in recaptured rebel areas. The mercenaries were also materially supported by the CIA.

In November 1964, the Simbas rounded up the remaining white population of Stanleyville and its environs. The whites were held hostage in the Victoria Hotel in the city to use as bargaining tools with the ANC. In order to recover the hostages, Belgian parachute troops were flown to the Congo in American aircraft to intervene. On 24 November, as part of Operation Dragon Rouge, Belgian paratroopers landed in Stanleyville and quickly secured the hostages. In total, around 70 hostages and 1,000 Congolese civilians were killed but the vast majority were evacuated. The Belgian troops were only under orders to liberate the hostages, rather than push the Simbas out of the city, but the attack nevertheless &quot;broke the back of the eastern insurrection, which never recovered.&quot; The Simba leadership went into exile in disarray and severe disagreement; Gbenye was shot in the shoulder by his general after dismissing him. Meanwhile, the Belgian paratroopers and the civilians returned to their country. In the aftermath of the intervention, Belgium itself was publicly accused of neocolonialism.

As a result of the intervention, Tshombe lost the support of Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu and was dismissed from his post as prime minister in October 1965. Soon after &quot;Dragon Rouge&quot;, ANC and mercenary troops captured Stanleyville, putting an end to the Simba rebellion. The Simba rebels executed 20,000 Congolese and 392 Western hostages, including 268 Belgians, during the rebellion. Tens of thousands of people were killed in total during the suppression of the Simbas. Pockets of Simba resistance continued to hold out in the eastern Congo, most notably in South Kivu, where Laurent-Désiré Kabila led a Maoist cross-border insurgency which lasted until the 1980s.

==Second Mobutu coup d&#x27;état==

In the scheduled March 1965 elections, Tshombe&#x27;s &quot;Convention Nationale Congolaise&quot; (CONACO) won a large majority of the seats, but a large part of his party soon defected to form the new &quot;Front Démocratique Congolais&quot; (FDC), making the overall result unclear as CONACO controlled the Chamber of Deputies while the FDC controlled the Senate. Kasa-Vubu, attempting to use the situation to block Tshombe, appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, Évariste Kimba of the FDC, to be prime minister-designate in November 1965, but the largely pro-Tshombe Parliament refused to ratify the appointment. Instead of seeking a compromise candidate, Kasa-Vubu again unilaterally declared Kimba to be prime minister, which was again rejected, creating a political deadlock. With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup, ostensibly to stop the impasse, on 25 November 1965.

Under the auspices of a &quot;régime d&#x27;exception&quot; (the equivalent of a state of emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost absolute, power for five years, after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored. Mobutu&#x27;s coup, which promised both economic and political stability, was supported by the United States and other Western governments, and his rule initially met widespread popularity. He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of prime minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967.

==Aftermath and legacy==
Once established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to demonstrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the &quot;Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution&quot; (MPR), which until 1990, was the nation&#x27;s only legal political party under Mobutu&#x27;s new constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed Zaire and efforts were made to remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country, including the UMHK which became &quot;Gécamines&quot;. Despite initial successes, by the time of its disestablishment Mobutu&#x27;s rule was characterised by widespread cronyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.

In the years after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many opposition figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government may have been involved. Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile by the promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.

===Political legacy===
The issues of federalism, ethnicity in politics and state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed to a decline in support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, was to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government is one of the reasons that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism. Local insurgencies continued in the eastern Congo into the 1980s and left a legacy of instability along the Congo&#x27;s eastern borders. Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who had led an anti-Mobutu insurrection during the crisis, succeeded in deposing Mobutu in 1997 and becoming president of the restored Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was succeeded by his son, Joseph Kabila. Following the fall of Mobutu, Antoine Gizenga founded a political party, the &quot;Parti Lumumbiste Unifié&quot; (PALU), and was appointed prime minister following the 2006 general election.

The Congo Crisis holds great significance in the collective memory of the Congolese people. In particular, Lumumba&#x27;s murder is viewed in the context of the memory as a symbolic moment in which the Congo lost its dignity in the international realm and the ability to determine its future, which has since been controlled by the West. Many Congolese view the problems of the crisis as unresolved, and believe that the Congo&#x27;s self-determination has yet to be secured from Western machinations. The latter notion has largely shaped the political aspirations of a substantial number of Congolese.

===Historiography and historical controversy===
The Congo Crisis is usually portrayed in historiography as a time of intense disorder and disarray; there is wide consensus that the processes around Congolese independence were a calamity. This interpretation often juxtaposes the crisis with the supposed stability of the Congo under Belgian rule before 1960 and under Mobutu&#x27;s regime after 1965. In Belgium, allegations of Belgian complicity in the killing of Lumumba led to a state-backed inquiry and subsequent official apology in 2001 for &quot;moral responsibility&quot;, though not direct involvement, in the assassination. Most academics have concluded that the United States intervened significantly in the crisis. The multi-volume official history of the American foreign service, &quot;Foreign Relations of the United States&quot;, was accused by academic David N. Gibbs of deliberately diminishing American involvement.
==International importance==
The turmoil of the Congo Crisis destabilised Central Africa and helped to ignite the Portuguese Colonial War, especially the war of independence in neighbouring Angola. Angolan nationalists had long had close ties with the Congo where many had lived as exiles. The &quot;União dos Povos de Angola&quot; (UPA), an Angolan nationalist organisation which drew support from the Angolan Bakongo, was supporting ABAKO politicians who had hopes of rebuilding the Kingdom of Kongo, altering the borders established during the colonial period. Believing that the independence of Congo was the first stage in this process, the UPA launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt in 1961, igniting the conflict in Angola that would last until 1974. The Congolese, later Zairian, governments continued to provide support to Angolan rebels and even participated directly in the subsequent Angolan Civil War.

The crisis caused the newly independent African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, it led to the division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country&#x27;s whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. Operation Refugee, a mobilisation of white Rhodesians to assist the displaced Congolese whites, was organised in response to the crisis. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965. It also drove European expatriates in the Central African Republic to support the increasing authoritarianism of David Dacko&#x27;s regime as a means of protecting their interests. The disorder of Congolese independence was frequently invoked in diplomatic discussions of Sub-Saharan Africa throughout the remainder of the 1960s.

The Katangese secession would prove to be politically influential in Africa. During the Chadian Civil War between 1965 and 1979, the &quot;Front de Libération Nationale du Tchad&quot; (FROLINAT) explicitly rejected secessionism in its bid to remove the southern-backed government of François Tombalbaye following the experience of the Katanga secession, officially stating that &quot;there will be no Katanga in Chad&quot;. In the Nigerian Civil War, between 1967 and 1970, the ethnically Igbo region of Biafra seceded from Nigeria, which it accused of privileging the interests of northern ethnic groups and discriminating against the Igbo. The secessions of Biafra and Katanga have frequently been compared in academic writing. Unlike Katanga, Biafra achieved limited official international recognition and rejected the support of Western multinational companies involved in the local oil industry. Biafra was defeated in 1970 and re-integrated into Nigeria.

<text>Tsavorite or tsavolite is a variety of the garnet group species grossular, a calcium-aluminium garnet with the formula Ca3Al2Si3O12. Trace amounts of vanadium or chromium provide the green color.

In 1967, British gem prospector and geologist Campbell R. Bridges discovered a deposit of green grossular in the mountains of Simanjiro District of Manyara Region of north-east Tanzania in a place called Lemshuko, away from Komolo, the first village. The specimens he found were of very intense color and of high transparency. The find interested the gem trade, and attempts were made to export the stones, but the Tanzanian government did not provide permits.

Believing that the deposit was a part of a larger geological structure extending possibly into Kenya, Bridges began prospecting in that nation. He was successful a second time in 1971, when he found the mineral variety there, and was granted a permit to mine the deposit. The gemstone was known only to mineral specialists until 1974, when Tiffany and Co launched a marketing campaign which brought broader recognition of the stone.

Bridges was murdered in 2009 when a mob attacked him and his son on their property in Tsavo East National Park. It is believed that the attack was connected to a three-year dispute over access and control of Bridges&#x27; gemstone mines.

The name &quot;tsavorite&quot; was proposed by Tiffany and Co president Henry Platt in honor of Tsavo East National Park in Kenya. Apart from this source and the first discovered locality in Manyara, Tanzania, it is also found in Toliara (Tuléar) Province, Madagascar. Small deposits of gem grade material have been found in Pakistan and Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. No other occurrences of gem material have yet been discovered.

Rare in gem-quality over several carats (1 carat = 200 mg), tsavorite has been found in larger sizes. In late 2006, a crystal was discovered. It yielded an oval mixed-cut 325 carat (65 g) stone, one of the largest, if not &quot;the&quot; largest, faceted tsavorites in the world. A crystal that yielded a oval mixed-cut gem was also uncovered in early 2006. The Lion of Merelani is a square cushion cut tsavorite that weighs 116.76 carats and has 177 facets. It is on display at the Smithsonian Institution. 

Tsavorite formed in a Neoproterozoic metamorphic event which involved extensive folding and refolding of rock. This resulted in a wide range of inclusions forming within most Tsavorite crystals. These inclusions are strong identifying features in Tsavorite.

<text>Bernhard Rust (30 September 1883 – 8 May 1945) was Minister of Science, Education and National Culture (&quot;Reichserziehungsminister&quot;) in Nazi Germany. A combination of school administrator and zealous Nazi, he issued decrees, often bizarre, at every level of the German educational system to immerse German youth in Nazi ideology. He also served as the party &quot;Gauleiter&quot; in Hanover and Brunswick from 1925 to 1940.

==Early life==
Rust was born in Hanover and obtained a doctorate in German philology and philosophy. After passing the state teaching examination with the grade &quot;gut&quot; (i.e. &quot;good&quot;) in 1908, he became a high school teacher at Hanover&#x27;s Ratsgymnasium, then served in the army during World War I. He reached the rank of &quot;Oberleutnant&quot;, served as a company commander and was awarded the Iron Cross first and second class for bravery. He was wounded in action and sustained a severe head injury, which caused serious mental and physical impairments for the rest of his life. He was discharged in December 1918 and returned to Hanover.

==Political career==
Rust joined the Nazi Party in 1921 and was a cofounder of the &quot;Ortsgruppe&quot; (Local Group) in Hanover. When the party was banned in the aftermath of the Beer Hall Putsch, Rust joined the German Völkisch Freedom Party and served as an &quot;Ortsgruppenleiter&quot; and later as &quot;Gauleiter&quot; for Hanover. When the ban on the Nazi Party was lifted, he rejoined it (membership number 3,390). On 22 March 1925, he was named &quot;Gauleiter&quot; for the &quot;Gau&quot; of North Hanover. On 10 September 1925, Rust joined the National Socialist Working Association headed by Gregor Strasser. This was an association of northern and western &quot;Gauleiter&quot; who supported the &quot;socialist&quot; wing of the Party until it was dissolved in 1926 following the Bamberg Conference.

When the &quot;Gaue&quot; were reorganised on 1 October 1928, Rust became the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; for Southern Hanover–Brunswick. He retained that position until November 1940, when he was succeeded by Hartmann Lauterbacher. In September 1930, he was elected to the Reichstag from electoral constituency 16, Southern Hanover-Brunswick. He would remain a Reichstag deputy through the end of the Nazi regime in 1945. On 15 July 1932 came his appointment as &quot;Landesinspekteur&quot; for Lower Saxony. In that position, he had oversight responsibility for his &quot;Gau&quot; and four others (Eastern-Hanover, North Westphalia, South Westphalia &amp; Weser-Ems). That was a short-lived initiative by Gregor Strasser to centralise control over the &quot;Gaue&quot;. However, it was unpopular with the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and was repealed on Strasser&#x27;s fall from power in December 1932. Rust then returned to his &quot;Gauleiter&quot; position in Southern Hanover-Brunswick.

Shortly after Hitler became chancellor in January 1933, Rust was appointed as the Prussian Minister for Science, Culture and Public Education on 2 February. He was made a member of the Prussian State Council on 11 July and the Academy for German Law when it was formed in October 1933. On 1 May 1934, he was selected as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of Science, Education and National Culture (&quot;Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung&quot;) and set about to reshape the German educational system to conform to his ideals of Nazism. Considered by many to be mentally unstable, Rust would capriciously create new regulations and then repeal them just as quickly. One noted example was in 1935, when he changed the traditional six-day school week to five days, with Saturday to be &quot;Reich&#x27;s Youth Day&quot;, when children in the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls would be out of school for study and testing. He then ordered the creation of a &quot;rolling week&quot;, with six days for study, followed by the &quot;youth day&quot; and a rest day, in eight-day periods. Thus, a rolling week starting on Monday would end with rest on the following Monday. The next rolling week would start on Tuesday and end eight days later on the next Tuesday. When the eight-day week proved unworkable, Rust went back to the former system.

It was Rust who in 1933 issued a rule that students and teachers should greet each other with the Nazi salute &quot;as a symbol of the new Germany&quot;. He added his opinion that it was &quot;expected of every German&quot;, regardless of membership in the party. Rust was instrumental in purging German universities of Jews and others regarded as enemies of the state, most notably at the University of Göttingen. Nazi Germany&#x27;s future leaders received their instruction elsewhere, in an NPEA, or &quot;Napola&quot; (NAtionalPOLitische erziehungsAnstalten), of which there were 30 in the nation, where they would receive training to become administrators of conquered provinces.

He bluntly informed teachers that their aim was to educate ethnically aware Germans. Rust also believed that non-Aryan science (such as Albert Einstein&#x27;s &quot;Jewish physics&quot;) was flawed and had what he felt to be a rational explanation for that view. In an address to scientists, he said, &quot;The problems of science do not present themselves in the same way to all men. The Negro or the Jew will view the same world in a different light from the German investigator&quot;. Erika Mann, the daughter of Thomas Mann, wrote an exposé of the Rust system in 1938, &quot;School for Barbarians&quot;, followed in 1941 by Gregor Ziemer&#x27;s &quot;Education for Death&quot;.

==Death==
Rust reportedly committed suicide on 8 May 1945, when Germany surrendered to Allied forces.

==Spelling reform==
Rust prepared a reform of German orthography, and his fairly-extensive version corresponded to the ideas of the spelling reformers of the 1970s (lowercase common nouns, elimination of lengthening symbols). The attempt met internal resistance within the Reich&#x27;s ministry. The German orthography reform of 1944 also failed.

Before those failures, the rules of the reform had been printed in millions of copies intended for classroom use and published in numerous newspapers. The 1944 reform was postponed on the orders of Hitler because it was &quot;not important for the war effort&quot;. Some of Rust&#x27;s innovations had, however, found their way into the 1942 Duden, such as the spelling of the word &quot;Kautsch&quot; for &quot;Couch&quot;, which persisted into the 1980s.

Many of the proposed changes were finally implemented with the German orthography reform of 1996.

<text>Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) is a private research university in Pohang, South Korea.

== History==
POSTECH was established in 1986 in Pohang, Korea by POSCO, a steel company.

POSTECH hosted POSCO&#x27;s Research Institute of Science and Technology (RIST) on campus. In 1994, POSTECH set up the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), a 3rd-generation synchrotron light source and now a national facility. PAL-XFEL, a 4th-generation light source X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) was completed in 2016 at the cost of US$390 million, the third of its kind in the world, and will open up new frontiers and research areas in life sciences, materials, chemistry, and physics.
===Timeline===

===Presidents===
== University rankings ==
In 1998, POSTECH was ranked by &quot;Asiaweek&quot; as the best science and technology university in Asia. From 2002 to 2006 &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot; ranked POSTECH as the leading university in Korea. In 2010, the Times Higher Education ranked POSTECH 28th in the world. In 2011, the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; ranked the university as the 53rd best university in the world, the 6th best in Asia, and the best in South Korea. In 2017–2018, QS World University Rankings ranked POSTECH 71st overall in the world. It remains third best ranked in Korea, after Seoul National University and KAIST, in the QS Asian University Rankings. However, in the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; rankings, it scored highly after compilers placed less emphasis on &quot;reputation and heritage&quot; and gave more weight to objective measures including the influence of universities&#x27; research, placing 53rd. In 2012 and 2013, the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; ranked POSTECH 1st in its &quot;100 Under 50 Young Universities&quot; rankings. &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; cited POSTECH&#x27;s rapid ascent as a young university to top the world rankings in less than 50 years.

==Campus==
POSTECH is a 400-acre campus located twenty minutes by car from downtown Pohang, an hour by bus from Busan, and approximately two and half hours by train (KTX) from Seoul.
===Tae-Joon Park Digital Library===
Completed in 2003, the Tae-Joon Park Library is 24,420 square meters with 352,977 volumes and 8,324 digital and paper journals. As of 2005, the library collection consists of approximately 320,000 books, 3,500 journals, 7,000 e-journals 25 databases, and 4,400 multimedia materials. The Library shares materials with industrial-educational-research cooperation and is part of an intercollegiate data exchange program with approximately 150 other research and educational institutions throughout the nation.

===Smart campus===
In 2010, for the first time among Korean universities, POSTECH implemented a Desktop Cloud Service. However, many of the previously implemented technological services (e.g. campus smartphone applications, university website, university online portal, etc.) are defective as they have not been since updated.

==Academics==

===Admissions===
POSTECH admits approximately 300 undergraduate students each year. POSTECH received 1,987 applicants for freshman admission and admitted 323 for the 2014 school year. POSTECH provides the highest educational investment and the most per-student scholarship support in Korea, allowing students from all economic backgrounds the opportunity to obtain a POSTECH education.

==Research==

The 4th generation light source (PAL-XFEL), which has been operational since 2015, is 10 billion times brighter than the 3rd generation light source.

<text>The Chrysler Firepower was a Dodge Viper-based concept car produced in 2005. It takes some of the styling cues from the Chrysler Crossfire. According to Chrysler, its 6.1 L Hemi V8 engine produced and could propel the vehicle to a 0-60 mph time of 4.5 seconds and had a top speed of 174 mph. The concept was once featured on the cover of &quot;Car and Driver&quot;.

Designers responsible for the design were Brian Nielander (exterior), who also worked on the ME-412 concept; and Greg Howell (interior).

== Plans for production ==
The Firepower Concept was built to prove that Chrysler could indeed build a hybrid car using existing hardware. Signs early in 2006 pointed to the Firepower going into production using the same hardware as the concept, but later that year Chrysler officially announced that the Firepower would not be produced, as they could not find a viable way of doing so.

<text>Defensive end (DE) is a defensive position in the sport of gridiron football.

This position has designated the players at each end of the defensive line, but changes in formations over the years have substantially changed how the position is played.

==History==
Early formations, with six- and seven-man lines, used the end as a containment player, whose job was first to prevent an &quot;end run&quot; around his position, then secondarily to force plays inside.

When most teams adopted a five-man line, two different styles of end play developed: &quot;crashing&quot; ends, who rushed into the backfield to disrupt plays, and &quot;stand-up&quot; or &quot;waiting&quot; ends, who played the more traditional containment style. Some teams would use both styles of end play, depending on game situations.

Traditionally, defensive ends are in a three-point stance, with their free hand cocked back ready to &quot;punch&quot; an offensive lineman, or in a two-point stance like a strong safety so they can keep containment. Some defensive ends play the position due to their size; they close down their gap so the running back has no hole to run through. Other ends play the position due to their speed and agility; they are used to rush the quarterback. These ends can time the snap of the ball in order to get a jump on the rush and stop the play.

It is usually the job of the defensive end in run defense to keep outside or containment, which means that no one should get to their outside; they must keep everything to the inside. If they have an outside linebacker besides them that is not in pass coverage, this gives the defensive end more freedom to rush the quarterback. The defensive ends are fast for players of their size, often the fastest and smallest players on the defensive line. They must be able to shed blockers to get to the ball. Defensive ends are also often used to cover the outside area of the line of scrimmage, to tackle ball carriers running to the far right or left side, and to defend against screen passes. Since the creation of zone blitz defenses in the late 1990s, defensive ends have sometimes been used in pass coverage, dropping back to cover routes run close to the line of scrimmage.

In the 3–4 defense, defensive ends are used primarily as run stoppers and are much larger than the normal size of a player at this position. Often, the position is played by a more agile or slightly undersized defensive tackle. Because of the increased popularity of the 3–4 defense, the value of a defensive tackle prospect that can possibly be used in this manner has increased. They are used to occupy an offensive lineman, on pass rushing plays to let the outside linebackers get a sack. They block screen passes and are put outside the offensive tackles to get a sack. Defensive ends in the 3–4 defense average a height of 6-foot-3 – 6-foot-8 and a weight of 285–315 lbs.

<text>The Polish Football Association ( PZPN) is the governing body of association football in Poland. It organizes the Polish football leagues (without the ), the Polish Cup and the Poland national football team. It is based in the Polish capital of Warsaw.

== History ==
The fully-independent federation was established on 20 December 1919 subsuming the autonomous Polish Football Union (PFU) that was part of the disintegrated Austrian Football Union. The PFU was established on 25 June 1911 in Lwów, Austria-Hungary.

When the Wehrmacht invaded Poland in September 1939, all Polish institutions and associations were dissolved, including the PZPN. The German occupying forces forbade Poles to organise football matches.

In September 2008, the leadership of the Polish Football Association was suspended by the Polish Olympic Committee for &quot;[violating] its statutes in a continuous and flagrant fashion&quot;. One year earlier, the Polish sports ministry also made an attempt to address corruption within the Polish Football Association, but was threatened with suspension by FIFA, which forbids any form of government intervention. On 30 October 2008, Grzegorz Lato became the president of the Polish Football Association. On 26 October 2012, Zbigniew Boniek was elected president after winning 61 votes from 118 delegates.

The football association turned 100 years with the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup during its centennial year. In 2019, Józef Klotz, who had played for the Poland national football team and was killed in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust, was honored by the Association. On 28 August 2021, Cezary Kulesza was elected president.

<doc id="1265435" wikidata="Q33205" url="?curid=1265435" title="Badaga language">
<text>Badaga is a southern Dravidian language spoken by the Badaga people of the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu. The language is closely related to the Kannada language with heavy influence from the Tamil language. Of all the tribal languages spoken in Nilgiris (Badaga, Toda language, Kota language (India)), Badaga is the most spoken 
language.

== Origins ==
Badaga, like modern Kannada, likely originates from Old Kannada. This is suggested by the fact that Badaga shares many common features with modern Kannada. One such feature shared by both Badaga and Kannada is initial where other Dravidian languages, and Old Kannada, have an initial , a process which began around the 13th century.

==Phonology==
Badaga has five vowel qualities, , where each of them may be long or short, and until the 1930s they were contrastively half and fully retroflexed, for a total of 30 vowel phonemes. Current speakers only distinguish retroflection of a few vowels.

Note on transcription: rhoticity indicates half-retroflexion; doubled it indicates full retroflexion.

== Writing system ==
Several attempts have been made at constructing an orthography based on English, Kannada and Tamil. The earliest printed book using Kannada script was a Christian work, &quot;Anga Kartagibba Yesu Kristana Olleya Suddiya Pustaka&quot; by Basel Mission Press of Mangaluru in 1890.

Badaga can also be written in the Kannada script and Tamil script.

== Linguistic documentation ==
Badaga has been studied and documented by linguists. Several Badaga-English Dictionaries have been produced since the latter part of the nineteenth century.

A collection of proverbs and other traditional sayings of the Badaga has been collated and edited by Paul Hockings. It is the result of the work of many people, collecting material over many decades.

<text>Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics (2003) is a historical book on mathematics by John Derbyshire, detailing the history of the Riemann hypothesis, named for Bernhard Riemann, and some of its applications. 

The book was awarded the Mathematical Association of America&#x27;s inaugural Euler Book Prize in 2007.

==Overview==
The book is written such that even-numbered chapters present historical elements related to the development of the conjecture, and odd-numbered chapters deal with the mathematical and technical aspects. Despite the title, the book provides biographical information on many iconic mathematicians including Euler, Gauss, and Lagrange.

In chapter 1, &quot;Card Trick&quot;, Derbyshire introduces the idea of an infinite series and the ideas of convergence and divergence of these series. He imagines that there is a deck of cards stacked neatly together, and that one pulls off the top card so that it overhangs from the deck. Explaining that it can overhang only as far as the center of gravity allows, the card is pulled so that exactly half of it is overhanging. Then, without moving the top card, he slides the second card so that it is overhanging too at equilibrium. As he does this more and more, the fractional amount of overhanging cards as they accumulate becomes less and less. He explores various types of series such as the harmonic series.

In chapter 2, Bernhard Riemann is introduced and a brief historical account of Eastern Europe in the 18th Century is discussed.

In chapter 3, the Prime Number Theorem (PNT) is introduced. The function which mathematicians use to describe the number of primes in &quot;N&quot; numbers, π(&quot;N&quot;), is shown to behave in a logarithmic manner, as so:
:formula_1
where &quot;log&quot; is the natural logarithm.

In chapter 4, Derbyshire gives a short biographical history of Carl Friedrich Gauss and Leonard Euler, setting up their involvement in the Prime Number Theorem.

In chapter 5, the Riemann Zeta Function is introduced:
:formula_2

In chapter 7, the sieve of Eratosthenes is shown to be able to be simulated using the Zeta function. With this, the following statement which becomes the pillar stone of the book is asserted:
:formula_3

Following the derivation of this finding, the book delves into how this is manipulated to expose the PNT&#x27;s nature.

==Audience and reception==
According to reviewer S. W. Graham, the book is written at a level that is suitable for advanced undergraduate students of mathematics. In contrast, James V. Rauff recommends it to &quot;anyone interested in the history and mathematics of the Riemann hypothesis&quot;.

Reviewer Don Redmond writes that, while the even-numbered chapters explain the history well, the odd-numbered chapters present the mathematics too informally to be useful, failing to provide insight to readers who do not already understand the mathematics, and failing even to explain the importance of the Riemann hypothesis. Graham adds that the level of mathematics is inconsistent, with detailed explanations of basics and sketchier explanations of material that is more advanced. But for those who do already understand the mathematics, he calls the book &quot;a familiar story entertainingly told&quot;.

<doc id="1265443" wikidata="Q7755965" url="?curid=1265443" title="The Palmer House Hilton">
<text>The Palmer House – A Hilton Hotel is a historic hotel in Chicago&#x27;s Loop area. It is a member of the Historic Hotels of America program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The first Palmer House opened in 1870, and the present building (the third) in 1925. In the 19th century, the Palmer House was the city&#x27;s first hotel with elevators, and the first hotel with electric light bulbs and telephones in the guest rooms. The hotel has been dubbed the longest continuously operating hotel in North America, although it temporarily closed from March 2020 to June 17, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
===First Palmer House===
The first was built as a wedding present from Potter Palmer to his bride Bertha Honoré. Located at State and Quincy, it opened on September 26, 1870. It burned one year later on October 9, 1871, during the Great Chicago Fire. Palmer had already begun construction of a new hotel at State and Monroe prior to the Great Chicago Fire. 
===Second Palmer House===
Designed by architect John M. Van Osdel, the second Palmer House Hotel was seven stories. Its amenities included oversized rooms, luxurious decor, and sumptuous meals served in grand style. The floor of its barber shop was tiled and silver dollars were embedded in a diamond pattern. Constructed mainly of iron and brick, the hotel was widely advertised as, &quot;The World&#x27;s Only Fire Proof Hotel.&quot; Famous visitors included presidential hopefuls James Garfield, Grover Cleveland, Ulysses S. Grant, William Jennings Bryan, and William McKinley; writers Mark Twain, L. Frank Baum, and Oscar Wilde; actresses Sarah Bernhardt and Eleonora Duse, and French cabaret singer Yvette Guilbert in 1897. It was completed in 1875. An 1895 meeting at the hotel of faculty representatives from various Midwestern universities resulted in the founding of the Big Ten Conference.

===Third Palmer House===
By the 1920s, the business in downtown Chicago could support a much larger facility, and the Palmer Estate decided to erect a new 25-story hotel. It hired Holabird &amp; Roche to design the building, and their team included architect Richard Neutra in a junior role. Between 1923 and 1925, the hotel was rebuilt on the same site.

In December 1945, Conrad Hilton bought the Palmer House for $20 million (equivalent to $ in ), and it was thereafter known as The Palmer House Hilton. In 2005, Hilton sold the property to Thor Equities, but retained management through the Hilton chain.

The architecture firms of Loebl Schlossman &amp; Hackl and David Fleener Architects completely renovated and restored the hotel between 2007 and 2009. The total cost was over $170 million (equivalent to $ in ). The hotel has a total of 1,639 guest rooms, making it the second-largest hotel in the city after the Hyatt Regency Chicago. It has recently had its name adjusted to Palmer House - A Hilton Hotel.

In 1970, the hotel was the site of the murder of Evelyn Okubo, a young Japanese-American racial justice activist attending a Japanese American Citizens League convention held there.

Entertainers who have appeared at the Palmer House&#x27;s Empire Room have included Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Liberace, Ella Fitzgerald, Maurice Chevalier, Lena Horne, Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Harry Belafonte, Sammy Davis Jr., Peggy Lee, Carol Channing, Bobby Darin, Jimmy Durante, Sonny &amp; Cher, Liza Minnelli, Dionne Warwick, Sophie Tucker, Tommy Dorsey, Phyllis Diller, Lou Rawls, Shep Fields (1930s) Dick Gregory (1963), Frankie Laine (1963), Josh White (1966), Tony Bennett (1968), Florence Henderson (1968), Donald O&#x27;Connor (1971), Jerry Lewis (1971), The Supremes (1971 &amp; 1972),Jane Powell (1972), Lorna Luft (1972), Trini Lopez (1973), The Lettermen (1973) and many others.

The hotel reopened to the public on June 17, 2021, following a series of upgrades to its interior, including a renovation to its indoor pool.

<text>Miroslav Šatan (; born 22 October 1974) is a Slovak former professional ice hockey right winger, who played 15 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), five in the Tipos Extraliga, and three in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Šatan was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Playing career==

===Pre-NHL===
In 1991–92, Šatan played for the local HC Topoľčany and did remarkably well, as he scored 30 goals and had 22 assists in just 31 games. He then graduated to the senior division within the same year. When he became 18, he joined Dukla Trenčín rather than enter compulsory army service for Slovakia (which stopped in 2006). He played there for the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons.

===Edmonton Oilers===
Šatan was drafted 111th overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the Edmonton Oilers. Prior to his entry into the NHL, he played in the Czechoslovak and Slovak leagues and he had scored nine goals in eight games representing Slovakia at the 1994 Winter Olympic Games.

In 1994–95, Šatan played a season in the minor leagues, split between four teams including the Oilers&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Cape Breton Oilers, and the International Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Vipers. While with the Vipers, he scored the winning goal in an exhibition game against Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s Ninety-Niners, an all-star team put together by Gretzky during the 1994–95 NHL lockout.

===Buffalo Sabres===
After two seasons with the Oilers, Šatan was traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Craig Millar and Barrie Moore. He would lead the Sabres in scoring on six occasions. During the 2004–05 NHL Lockout, Šatan played for Slovan Bratislava in the Slovak Extraliga. After the lockout, Šatan was not offered a contract by the Sabres.

===New York Islanders===
Šatan signed as a free agent with the New York Islanders on 3 August 2005. He led the Islanders in goals in the 2005–06 season. His 35 goals during the season were his highest goal-output since the 2001–02 season with the Sabres. Almost half his 35 goals came on the power play (17), also a career personal best. Šatan tied for the team lead in points with 66, shared with captain Alexei Yashin. Also in 2005–06, Šatan went seven for ten (70%) and was third in the NHL in shooting percentage in the shootout.

On 2 December 2006, he scored his 300th career goal, against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Earlier in the season, he had recorded his 300th career assist and his 600th career point.

On 24 March 2007, Šatan missed the Islanders&#x27; game in Philadelphia for personal reasons, ending a streak of having played in 305 consecutive games. It was the fourth longest active streak at the time, and marked the second time in his career that he had played over 250 consecutive games. He had a 256-game streak as a member of the Sabres that ended in November 2002.

===Pittsburgh Penguins===

On 3 July 2008, Šatan signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins. During the 2008–09 season, Šatan was placed on waivers by Pittsburgh on 4 March 2009, the same day as the NHL trade deadline, not long after playing in his 1,000th NHL game. Having not been claimed by another team, Šatan was assigned to the Penguins&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. In Wilkes-Barre, Šatan had three goals and nine points in ten games. Various reports credited him with being upbeat and a good influence, especially with the younger players.

On 10 April 2009, Šatan was recalled by Pittsburgh and cleared re-entry waivers. He re-established himself with the Penguins in the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs when he played against the Washington Capitals in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals on April 23. He then played in nine games and won his first ever Stanley Cup as a member of the Penguins.

The Penguins did not re-sign Šatan when his contract expired at the end of the season, and he was not signed during the free agency period.

===Boston Bruins===

On 2 January 2010, Šatan signed a US$700,000 contract with the Boston Bruins for the remainder of the 2009–10 season. The contract included a no movement clause. He made his Bruins debut against the Ottawa Senators on January 5, finishing with a +2 plus-minus. He scored his first a goal as a Bruin on January 7 against Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Antti Niemi. On April 21, he scored the game-winning goal in double overtime to defeat the Buffalo Sabres and take a 3–1 lead in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. On April 26, Šatan then scored the series-winning goal over the Sabres with 5:11 remaining in the game.

===Dynamo Moscow===
At the beginning of 2011, Šatan signed with Dynamo Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) until the end of 2010–11 season. The club opted not to renew his contract upon its expiry.

===Return to Slovan Bratislava and retirement===
On 8 September 2011, Šatan moved to the Slovak Extraliga to rejoin former club Slovan Bratislava. In 2012–13, Slovan moved from the Slovak Extraliga to the KHL and named Šatan team captain. He was badly injured by his former Boston Bruins teammate Zdeno Chára in a match against Lev Praha on 3 November 2012. Subsequently, Šatan said he did not know if he would play another hockey match in his life. Šatan would return to play in the 2013 IIHF World Championship.

Šatan announced his retirement from professional ice hockey on 20 May 2014.

==Post-playing career==
In September 2015, Šatan was appointed general manager for Team Europe to compete in the 2016 World Cup. Team Europe finished second in the tournament after losing the final series to Canada.

In June 2019, he was elected President of the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation.

==Personal life==
Šatan grew up in Topoľčany, Slovakia. He married his long-time girlfriend Ingrid in 2004. They have a son, Miroslav Jr., born in March 2006 and a daughter, Viktoria, born in July 2009, and live in Jericho, New York. Miroslav Jr. also plays hockey, and was drafted by the Washington Capitals in the seventh round of the 2024 NHL entry draft.

Because Šatan&#x27;s name is a heteronym of Satan, many devil-related jokes have been made at his expense. During his career, many sports-data sites (including Fox Sports, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, ESPN and Yahoo) used the number 666 in the URL of Šatan&#x27;s page. A popular April Fool&#x27;s joke had Šatan traded to the New Jersey Devils and been made captain of his new team, making Šatan the &quot;leader&quot; of the Devils. After Šatan announced his retirement in 2014, the Yahoo headline read: &quot;Satan be gone!&quot;

<text>Orobanche, commonly known as broomrape, is a genus of almost 200 species of small parasitic herbaceous plants, mostly native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It is the type genus of the broomrape family Orobanchaceae. It is a weed on broadleaf crop plants in Australia, where some states enforce mandatory destruction and reporting, as well as prohibition of sale. 

==Description==
Broomrapes are generally small, only tall depending on species. They are best recognized by the yellow- to straw-coloured stems completely lacking chlorophyll, bearing yellow, white, or blue snapdragon-like flowers. The flower shoots are scaly, with a dense terminal spike of 10-20 flowers in most species, although single in one-flowered broomrape (&quot;Orobanche uniflora&quot;). The leaves are merely triangular scales. The seeds are minute, tan or brown, blackening with age. These plants generally flower from late winter to late spring. When they are not flowering, no part of the plants is visible above the surface of the soil.

==Parasitism==
As they have no chlorophyll, the broomrapes are totally dependent on other plants for nutrients. Broomrape seeds remain dormant in the soil, often for many years, until stimulated to germinate by certain compounds produced by living plant roots. Broomrape seedlings put out a root-like growth, which attaches to the roots of nearby hosts. Once attached to a host, the broomrape robs its host of water and nutrients.

Some species are only able to parasitise a single plant species, and they are often named after the plant they parasitise, such as ivy broomrape (&quot;O. hederae&quot;) being restricted to parasitising ivy. Others can infect several genera, such as the lesser broomrape &quot;O. minor&quot;, which lives on clover and other related Fabaceae.

Branched broomrape &quot;Orobanche ramosa&quot;, native to central and southwestern Europe but widely naturalised elsewhere, is considered a major threat to crops in some areas. Plants that it targets are tomato, eggplant, potato, cabbage, coleus, bell pepper, sunflower, celery, and beans. In heavily infested areas, branched broomrape can cause total crop failure.

The bean broomrape &quot;Orobanche crenata&quot;, which targets the fava bean, has stems that are gathered and eaten in the Italian region of Apulia.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Orobanche&quot; comes from the Greek (), from ( &quot;bitter vetch&quot;) + ( (I) &quot;strangle&quot;). The common name &quot;broomrape&quot; comes from the English &quot;broom&quot; (a plant) + Latin (&#x27;tuber&#x27;).

<text>The Russian Football Union (, &quot;Rossiyskiy Futbolnyy Soyuz&quot; or RFS) is the official governing body of association football in the Russian Federation. With headquarters in Moscow, it organizes Russian amateur and professional football, including the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, youth, beach soccer, futsal and Paralympic national teams. The RFS sanctions referees and football tournaments for the Russian Premier League and other football leagues in Russia. RFS is headed by Aleksandr Dyukov, the CEO of Gazprom Neft.

==Structure==
The RFS is governed by a board of directors led by a chairman, Nikita Simonyan, and a director general, Aleksandr Alayev. The RFU is a member of international football bodies FIFA and UEFA, and also has a relationship with the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

==History==
===Russian Empire===
The All-Russian Football Union (VFS) was created on 19 January 1912 and in the same year was admitted to FIFA. The Unions initially consisted of 52 organizations across the Russian Empire. All-Russian Football Union was the organizer of Russian Empire national football team.

=== Soviet Union ===
In 1934, the &quot;Football Federation of USSR&quot; was formed initially under the name the Football Section of Soviet Union. Its organization was in accordance with the Declaration of the All-Union Council of Fitness Culture of USSR on 27 December 1934. The Section was admitted to FIFA as the Soviet organization in 1946, and admitted to UEFA in 1954. Later the Section was reorganized as the Football Federation of USSR. Concurrently with the Section and later Federation until 1972 there operated the &quot;Football Directorate of the Soviet Sport Committee&quot; which was subordinated directly to the Soviet Ministry of Sport. The Directorate was never recognized on the international level.

===Russian Federation===

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on 9 January 1992 there was formed the All-Russian Association of Football (VAF) based on the RSFSR Federation of Football and headed by Anzor Kavazashvili. The VAF conference consisted of 173 delegates from the whole Russian Federation, out of which 172 voted for Kavazashvili, while Kavazashvili abstained from voting himself. The president of the former Soviet federation Koloskov decided to create a parallel organization the Russian Football Union, even though the All-Russian Association of Football (VAF) was acknowledged by the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation as the only governing body of association football in the country.

At the same time Vyacheslav Koloskov who was appointed a president of the Commonwealth of Independent States associations of football federations (descendant of the Soviet Union Football Federation) tried to resolve an issue of conducting the 1992 football championship by negotiating with the Muscovite clubs.

On 31 January 1992 the president of the &quot;supposedly still existing&quot; RSFSR Football Federation Yuri Nyrkov announced about scheduling a conference on 8 February 1992.

On 8 February 1992 at the RSFSR Football Federation conference was created the modern Russian Football Union and Vyacheslav Koloskov was elected the president. At the conference, the Russian Football Union was declared a descendant of both the RSFSR Football Federation as well as the Football Federation of the Soviet Union. Using political connections, Koloskov managed to influence governing bodies of the Russian Federation and the UEFA to reconsider recognition of the All-Russian Association of Football and instead recognize his organization. The newly formed Russian Football Union eventually inherited everything from the previous associations such as the VFS and Football Federation of USSR and reinstated in FIFA on 3 July 1992. In July 1992, the Russian national football team was formed.

====Russian invasion of Ukraine====
Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA and UEFA suspended all Russian teams, whether national representative teams or clubs, until further notice.

After the invasion of Ukraine, Adidas suspended its long-term kit partnership with the Russian Football Union, which first began in 2008. Adidas had provided all Russian teams with kits and had expanded the federation&#x27;s replica kit sales in the retail market.

During the ban, talk circulated that the RFU were considering seeking to change confederations to the Asian Football Confederation, according to Match-TV broadcaster Dmitry Pirog, stating, &quot;I think the time has come to think seriously about a switch to the Asian football confederation.&quot; However, Vyacheslav Koloskov opposed the idea, noting that it would &quot;bring the death of Russian football and also we would never return to the European family.&quot; In any event, the switch would have to be ratified by other Asian federations. RFU president Alexander Dyukov ruled out the idea of switching to Asian football and stated that the RFU is part of UEFA and will always be so. In late November 2022, Dyukov said, at an executive board meeting on behalf of TASS, that the possibility of a switch of the association to the AFC might be considered. On 29 December 2022, it was reported that the RFU would hold a meeting the next day to discuss resigning from UEFA, so as to join the AFC. On 30 December, following the meeting, Dyukov stated: &quot;We are indeed considering the option of returning to UEFA competitions as soon as possible&quot;, &quot;It is important for us to take part in the World Cup qualifiers&quot;. On 20 December 2023, Russian Football Union executive committee voted against the move to Asian Football Confederation. 

In October 2023, FIFA and UEFA lifted the ban on both U-17 teams, allowing them to return to competitions. This was met with opposition from Ukraine and some other UEFA members. England, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, and Romania announced that they would not play any Russian U-17 team. UEFA later axed the plan.

<text>Dorothy Jean Tillman (née Wright; May 12, 1947) is an American politician, civil rights activist and former Chicago, Illinois alderman. Tillman served as the alderman of the city&#x27;s 3rd ward (map) from 1985 until 2007. A member of the Democratic Party, representing part of the city&#x27;s South Side in the Chicago City Council. As an Alderman, Tillman was a strong advocate of reparations for slavery. In April 2007, Tillman was defeated in a runoff election by challenger Pat Dowell. Tillman defeated Dowell in 2003. Prior to her career as an alderman, Tillman was active in the Civil Rights Movement, working for Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) as an activist. Tillman was known for wearing large hats and has cultivated this image as her trademark.

==Biography==
===Civil rights movement===
Tillman was born as Dorothy Jean Wright in Montgomery, Alabama to James Wright, a local handyman and Edna Mae Struggs (formerly Wright; d. November 30, 2009). Tillman&#x27;s parents divorced when she was a child which resulted in her spending her childhood between Montgomery with her father and Pensacola, Florida, where her mother had remarried and relocated to. Tillman joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) as a trainee and field staff organizer in 1963. Tillman marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and was among the SCLC Field Staff to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama in the Selma to Montgomery marches on 7 March 1965.

Tillman had her first involvement in Chicago politics later in 1965 when King sent her there to campaign for better housing, education and employment conditions for blacks. This campaign marked the start of King&#x27;s effort to improve socio-economic conditions for blacks. Tillman was involved in organizing King&#x27;s move into a Chicago tenement in early 1966 and the launch of his campaign in July 1966. By 1967, Tillman and her husband, Jimmy, moved to San Francisco shortly after their marriage and became involved in a successful campaign to improve public transport services to their neighborhood.

Tillman and her husband later returned to Chicago where she became involved in educational issues. Tillman founded the Parent Equalizers of Chicago, which eventually became active in 300 schools across the city, setting the groundwork for school reform in Chicago. The momentum created by several successful grassroots campaigns Tillman helped organize led to the election of Chicago&#x27;s first African American mayor, Harold Washington in 1983.

===Chicago Alderman (1985–2007)===
Dorothy Tillman was appointed by Mayor Harold Washington and later elected as an alderman representing the city&#x27;s third ward in February 1985, being the first woman elected for that ward. Tillman pioneered the first TIF to be used in the black community, with the construction of the 55th and Dan Ryan shopping center. She helped to found the African American Home Builders Association and advocated for a 70/30 plan to make certain that African Americans received the majority of the contracts.

Amid the Democratic primary of the 1989 Chicago mayoral special election, in which she was supporting Timothy C. Evans, Tillman called incumbent mayor Eugene Sawyer an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;. In July 1988, after months of attacks on him from Tillman, Evans himself, and other allies of Evans such as Bobby Rush, Sawyer retaliated by stripping them of their committee chairmanships in a City Council restructuring. In this, Tillman was removed as chairman of the Housing Committee.

In 2000, Tillman requested that two waiters at the Palmer House hotel in Chicago be replaced with African-American waiters for a banquet hosted by Alderman Tillman. Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley delivered a strongly worded rebuke in the media.

Tillman was an advocate of reparations for slavery and was successful in having a number of resolutions passed in support of the concept. She authored a bill, passed unanimously in 2002, forcing companies who perform contracts with the council to declare any past ties with slavery. In early 2005, Tillman led a campaign against a $500 million (~$ in ) refinancing deal with the Bank of America because of its alleged links with slavery. In the case of the Bank of America, these links are allegedly through FleetBoston Financial, a company which it acquired in 2004. Providene, a predecessor of Fleet Boston, was supposedly founded by a slave owner in 1791.

During one loud session of the City Council, Tillman gained the attention of the entire floor when she produced a pistol from her handbag and brandished it about. This led some aldermen and Chicago citizens to call for a censure on Tillman&#x27;s professional ethics, and possible mandatory gun safety training.

Tillman has been involved in the Harold Washington Cultural Center (HWCC) since its inception. A 2006 three-part investigative report by the Chicago local paper &quot;Lakefront Outlook&quot; reported accounting irregularities and conflicts of interest by Tillman and her family. Despite the controversy and his stand on ethics reform, U.S. Senator Barack Obama endorsed Tillman in her 2007 election noting she was an early supporter of his.

Although she had the backing of Chicago&#x27;s Mayor Richard Daley, Tillman was not able to achieve a majority of votes in Chicago&#x27;s non-partisan aldermanic election in February 2007. As a result, Tillman stood in a runoff election against challenger Pat Dowell. Dowell took 54 percent of the vote to 46 percent for Tillman. During a heated debate between Tillman and Dowell on April 3, 2007, Dowell charged Tillman with failing to produce business growth beyond the street corner where her ward office was located and stated &quot;I will be the change agent,&quot; after which Tillman&#x27;s daughter (and political staffer) shouted out &quot;A white man agent!&quot;

==Personal==
Tillman has been married once and has five children. Tillman married Jimmy Lee Tillman, a musician circa 1967. Together they had five children including Jimmy Lee Tillman Jr. (b. 1968) who ran for U.S. Congress in 2014, and Ebony Tillman who challenged third ward alderman Pat Dowell in 2011. In October 2008 Tillman was convicted for criminal trespassing at an Alabama hospital in March 2008. A dispute over medical records escalated and the police were called. Tillman claims she was brutalized by the police. She was fined and received a suspended sentence. Her lawyer stated that an appeal is planned.
The charge was eventually dropped as part of a settlement with the hospital.

==2021 scandals==
In 2021, The Football Association of Iceland was shaken by serious scandals. On 13 August, an article titled &quot;On KSÍ and Misogyny&quot; appeared on the Icelandic newsweb Vísir.is, written by activist Hanna Björg Vilhjálmsdóttir, stating that representatives of the Association had actively suppressed news of a gang rape where the perpetrators had been two well-known Icelandic professional footballers. Four days later, a declaration from KSÍ appeared in the media, claiming that the Association had never attempted to silence or suppress cases of violence and assaults. Vilhjálmsdóttir&#x27;s article was repudiated as &quot;insinuations&quot; (&quot;dylgjur&quot;). On 26 August, Guðni Bergsson, president of KSÍ was interviewed on RÚV, Iceland&#x27;s national TV, and claimed that the Association totally disapproved of any kind of violence, sexual or other. Additionally, Guðni stated that The Football Association had never received any formal notifications of violence by professional footballers. The following day, Guðni was contradicted by Þórhildur Gyða Arnarsdóttir, an Icelandic woman in her mid-twenties, who had been sexually assaulted by a member of the Icelandic Football Team in 2017. Þórhildur reported the crime to the police, but no action was taken. Six months later, Þórhildur&#x27;s father realised that his daughter&#x27;s aggressor had been recruited on the national team for an upcoming match. He consequently reported the incident to the Football Association and received the reply that action would be taken. However, the aggressor remained on the team and KSÍ took no action. Þórhildur additionally claimed that she had been contacted by a lawyer, sent by KSÍ, who offered her a compensation and asked her to sign a confidentiality agreement of the incident. Following the interview with Þórhildur, Guðni Bergsson resigned as president of KSÍ. 

Following Guðni&#x27;s resignation, two players were removed from the national team: Kolbeinn Sigþórsson and Rúnar Már Sigurjónsson. Kolbeinn was subsequently exposed as the perpetrator of the assault on Þórhildur.

The board of KSÍ intended to continue undisturbed after Guðni&#x27;s renouncement, claiming that the Association would be unfunctional without them. However, a majority of KSÍ&#x27;s member societies protested and demanded that the board and the manager resign. A number of KSÍ&#x27;s major sponsors added to the threat by stating that they would rescind their contracts with the Association unless its leaders seriously improved how reports of sexual abuse were treated. Within two days of Bergsson&#x27;s resignation, the entire board of KSÍ, consisting of 14 men and 2 women, had resigned as well.

<doc id="1265488" wikidata="Q7812664" url="?curid=1265488" title="Todd Stroger">
<text>Todd H. Stroger (born January 14, 1963) is the former president of the Cook County, Illinois Board and a former alderman for the 8th ward in Chicago. Stroger is a member of the Democratic Party. In 2001, he was appointed to the Chicago City Council by Richard M. Daley. He is the son of John Stroger, who himself had served as Cook County Board president for 12 years until his death.

On February 2, 2010, Stroger finished last in the Democratic primary for President of the Cook County Board behind Dorothy A. Brown, Terrence J. O&#x27;Brien and Toni Preckwinkle (who won the primary), putting him in a lame duck stage for the remainder of his board presidency. Preckwinkle would go on to win the general election and assume office on December 6, 2010.

In 2021, Stroger served as village administrator of Robbins, Illinois.

== Early life ==
Stroger was raised in the Chatham-Avalon neighborhood, located on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. He attended Gordon Tech and later received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Xavier University in New Orleans. Before becoming an alderman he worked as an investment banker for SBK Brooks Investment Corporation.

==Political career==
In 1992, Stroger was elected as State Representative for the 31st District of Illinois. Stroger worked as a statistician for the Office of the Chief Judge of Cook County; later he was also a jury supervisor with the Cook County Jury Commissioners. He worked for the Chicago Park District during the tenure of Forrest Claypool.

Stroger is an active fundraiser for the United Negro College Fund and a member of the Young Democrats.

===Aldermanic career===
In 2001 Stroger was appointed by Mayor Richard M. Daley to replace Lorraine Dixon, who had died while in office. Stroger served on seven committees: Budget and Government Operations; Committees, Rules, and Ethics; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations; Police and Fire; Special Events and Cultural Affairs; and Traffic Control and Safety.

===2006 County Board Presidential nomination===
On March 14, 2006, John Stroger, Cook County Board of Commissioners president since 1994 and Todd Stroger&#x27;s father, suffered a serious stroke one week before the Democratic primary. John Stroger eventually won the Democratic nomination, winning about 53 percent of the votes cast, defeating Forrest Claypool. For months after the elder Stroger&#x27;s stroke he did not appear in public, and his family provided little information about his condition.

Shortly after the stroke, Todd Stroger gave noncommittal responses about the likelihood that his father would remain on the ballot. But in May, he reversed his previous stance, saying his father would return to office. Ultimately, John Stroger would submit his resignation. At the same time that John Stroger submitted his resignation, it was announced that alderman William Beavers would assume the County Commissioner seat while Todd Stroger, if elected, would take over the County Board presidency. This announcement came four days after the deadline for third-party candidates to file for the Board presidency race.

In the aftermath of his father&#x27;s resignation, Todd Stroger emerged as the front-runner for his father&#x27;s presidential seat. His main opponent was U.S. Representative Danny K. Davis. Another opponent, County Commissioner Bobbie Steele, dropped out of the race shortly before party leaders chose a new candidate.

On July 18, 2006, the Cook County Democratic Central Committee (a collection of 80 county Democratic party leaders also known as &quot;ward committeemen&quot; or &quot;township committeemen&quot;) overwhelmingly chose Todd Stroger to replace his father as the Democratic candidate for Cook County Board president for the Nov. 7, 2006 election. The following day, Steele was unanimously elected by the Board as interim president.

According to state election officials, in July 2008, Stroger&#x27;s campaign paid almost $27,000 in fines for failing to file paperwork in a timely manner. Paperwork was not filed on time for the 2006 election contributions it received along with late organization papers that were sent to the election board. The campaign also filed incomplete and late reports to the State Board of Elections during the week of July 21, 2008, so more fines are expected to be brought forth.

==Later political and government career==
Stroger was a candidate in the Democratic primary of the 2020 Cook County clerk of courts election. However, he withdrew his candidacy once a challenge to his ballot petitions had disqualified enough signatures to have him removed from the ballot. 

After Darren E. Bryant was elected the mayor of Robbins, Illinois in April 2021, he announced his intention to appoint Stroger as village administrator (city manager). On October 5, 2021, Stroger was moved from his position as village administrator to the position of executive assistant to Bryant, switching places with Jasmine Washington (who became village administrator).

== Criticism and response ==
=== Hiring ===
Stroger drew fire for perceived nepotism, including promoting his cousin Donna Dunnings, who had worked in the County&#x27;s budget office for 16 years, to the position of the County&#x27;s chief financial officer. Dunnings and Stroger received additional criticism when she received a $17,000 raise after she initially agreed to not accept a pay hike (in an attempt to help county finances). Dunnings stated that critics could have blocked the pay raise by submitting an amendment to the proposed budget &quot;if they were so concerned about the salary of the first African-American female CFO&quot;.

Dunnings was later forced to resign her position after the press reported that she had posted bail for Tony Cole, a former University of Georgia basketball player and busboy whom Stroger had hired to a $60,000/year Cook County position despite Cole&#x27;s having an extensive felony record. On April 16, 2009, Dunnings resigned at Stroger&#x27;s request over the scandal involving the hiring of Cole as a human resources assistant in the County Highway Department. Stroger had earlier fired Cole (in Cook County Jail in connection with a domestic violence case at the time Dunnings resigned) for concealing his felony record.

=== Tax increase ===
Stroger also drew criticism when he began raising certain taxes in an effort to balance the county budget and resolve staffing issues. In September 2007, he voiced his support for a proposal to raise the county-wide sales tax to 11 percent (an additional two cents on the dollar) to remedy a $307 million budget deficit, which would force public facilities such as Stroger Hospital to cut services or even close. Critics of the plan included fellow Commissioners Claypool, Gorman, Peraica, and Mike Quigley who argued that spending cuts would accomplish the same purpose. Peraica additionally responded that Cook County&#x27;s poorest citizens, who the tax hike is ultimately designed to serve, would find it to be the most unaffordable. Peraica&#x27;s argument was seconded by then-Governor Rod Blagojevich, who expressed his opposition to the plan. Gorman was instrumental, however, in refusing to back down and she introduced a resolution to repeal the sales tax on three separate occasions, finally winning board majority support on the third effort.

On February 29, 2008, the Cook County Board, by a measure of 10-7, passed a budget initiated by Stroger. Stroger&#x27;s budget contained a tax increase of 1 percentage point, the largest ever passed by Cook County, with the intent of creating more than 1,000 new County jobs. As a result of Stroger&#x27;s bill, on July 1 the County sales tax increased from 0.75 percent to 1.75 percent bringing Chicago&#x27;s overall sales tax to 10.25 percent, which was the highest of any major U.S. city, while the sales tax was a minimum of 8.75 percent in suburban Cook County. All five Republican members of the County Board voted against the tax increase and they were joined by two of the twelve Democrats. Commissioners who voted against the tax increase were Peter N. Silvestri, Quigley, Claypool, Gregg Goslin, Timothy Schneider, Peraica, and Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman. Despite the 133% increase, Dunnings stated on March 31, 2008, that the budget shortfall resolved that year is expected to return. She explained that the expected cost increase would be the result of what she described as a &#x27;structural deficit&#x27;, meaning increases in revenue being unable to match increases in expense, citing runaway health care costs among other problems. A county spokesman indicated that it would most likely happen in three or four years, well into the next county presidential term.

Because of a number of unanswered questions and unresolved issues surrounding the county tax increase, Cook County&#x27;s outlying communities, particularly Palatine, IL, considered secession and threatened to do so unless an explanation was provided. To avoid this schism, officials from Palatine and Cook County, including Stroger initially, agreed to hold a town hall meeting at Harper College on April 30 to discuss details of the hike that remain unclear. However, on April 29, Stroger announced that he would not attend, accusing Palatine officials of using the meeting for political grandstanding indicating that he &quot;[would] not debate local Palatine elected officials who expect to exploit this opportunity to further their own political agendas&quot;. Eventually, Stroger did attend the Town Hall, which resulted in heavy press coverage and several &quot;Daily Herald&quot; articles refuting the claims he made while presenting there.

The tax increase was later partially rolled back by 0.5%. Chicago&#x27;s overall sales tax is 9.75% and suburban Cook County is at minimum 8.25%.

<text>The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is an American bank holding company and financial services corporation based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Its banking  subsidiary, PNC Bank, operates in 27 states and the District of Columbia, with 2,629 branches and 9,523 ATMs. PNC Bank is on the list of largest banks in the United States by assets and is one of the largest banks by number of branches, deposits, and number of ATMs.

The company also provides financial services such as asset management, wealth management, estate planning, loan servicing, and information processing. PNC is one of the largest Small Business Administration lenders and one of the largest credit card issuers. It also provides assetbased lending to private equity firms and middle market companies. PNC operates one of the largest treasury management businesses and the second largest lead arranger of assetbased loan syndications in the United States. Harris Williams &amp; Co., a subsidiary of the company, is one of the country&#x27;s largest mergers and acquisitions advisory firms for middle-market companies. Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC Real Estate based in Overland Park, Kansas and founded in 1991, is ranked by Mortgage Bankers Association as the second largest master and primary servicer of commercial bank and savings institution loans.

The name &quot;PNC&quot; is derived from the initials of both of the bank&#x27;s two predecessor companies: Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation, which merged in 1983. PNC Mortgage (formerly National City Mortgage) is credited with funding the first mortgage in the United States and has offices across the country.

==History==

PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 10, 1845. Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Trust and Savings was not fully operational until January 28, 1852. It originally opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th Street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853. In 1858, the company located its corporate offices to the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh, where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863 after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter as part of that year&#x27;s National Banking Act. It received the 48th charter on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business.

In 1946, First National merged with Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company – with whom it had worked closely since the 1930s – to form Peoples First National Bank &amp; Trust. In 1959, Peoples First merged with Fidelity Trust Company to form Pittsburgh National Bank. At this time, the bank adopted the first version of its present logoa stylized triangle representing the city&#x27;s Golden Triangle. 

Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphiabased Provident National Corporation, dates back to 1865.

In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation, both with PNC as their abbreviations, merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation. It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets. Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions, including the $30 billion dollar merger of Midlantic Bank of Edison New Jersey in 1996, that at the time, was one-third the size of PNC. That broadened its market base from Kentucky to the New York metropolitan area.

Since 1984, PNC has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;.

In 1998, PNC acquired Hilliard Lyons for $275 million in cash and stock. Hilliard Lyons was sold in 2008.

In 1998, PNC sold its credit card business to Metris (now HSBC Finance) and MBNA.

In 2000, the company adopted a new brand image and changed its name to PNC Financial Services Group.

In 2001, PNC sold the original PNC Mortgage to Washington Mutual due to volatility in the market.

In 2004, PNC acquired United National Bancorp based in Bridgewater, New Jersey, for $321 million in cash and 6.6 million shares of its common stock.

In 2005, PNC acquired Riggs National Corporation of Washington, D. C. Riggs had been fined after aiding Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in money laundering. PNC became one of the largest banks in the Washington metropolitan area.

In 2005, PNC began outsourcing mortgages to Wells Fargo.

In August 2006, PNC got back into the credit card business by marketing and issuing credit cards under the MasterCard brand in partnership with U.S. Bancorp (U.S. Bank) . After the National City merger (see below) in 2008, the U.S. Bancorp (U.S. Bank) products were converted to PNC Bank products.

On March 2, 2007, PNC acquired Maryland-based Mercantile Bankshares, making PNC the eighth largest bank in the United States by deposits. 

On October 26, 2007, PNC acquired Yardville National Bancorp, a small commercial bank centered in central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.

On September 15, 2007, PNC Bank acquired Citizens National Bank of Laurel, Maryland.

On April 4, 2008, PNC acquired Sterling Financial Corporation, a commercial and consumer bank with accounts and branches in central Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland and Delaware.

On October 24, 2008, during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the National City acquisition by PNC for $5.2 billion in stock was completed. The acquisition was financed with preferred stock sold to the United States Treasury as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program implemented as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The stock issued to the U.S. Treasury was repurchased in 2010. PNC then became the 5th largest bank in the United States by deposit and fourth largest by branches.

On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings &amp; Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed in receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide loans to lowincome African Americans that other banks would deny. The branch was closed and accounts were transferred to the existing PNC branch in the Hill District.

In July 2010, PNC sold its Global Investment Servicing (GIS) subsidiary to The Bank of New York Mellon to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which had been used for the National City acquisition (see above) in 2008. GIS, established in 1973 and with 4,700 employees, was the secondlargest fullservice mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the secondlargest fullservice accounting and administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. GIS serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. It was known as PFPC until July 2008.

In January 2011, PNC acquired BankAtlantic&#x27;s Tampa Bay Area branches.

In December 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern Atlanta suburbs with $240 million in deposits and $42 million in book value from Flagstar Bank.

In 2012, PNC acquired RBC Bank from Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion. RBC Bank had a 426 branches in southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Prior to the acquisition, PNC had slipped (due to mergers and growth in other firms) from its ranking following the 2008 National acquisition; this 2012 acquisition made PNC the fifth largest bank by branches behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and U.S. Bank and the sixth largest by total assets behind the aforementioned four banks and Citibank.

On July 30, 2012, PNC announced plans to put ATMs in 138 Harris Teeter grocery stores in the Carolinas, plus 53 other stores.

In September 2014, PNC acquired Solebury Capital Group, a capital markets advisory firm, for $50 million.

On October 2, 2015, the bank opened Tower at PNC Plaza, its new headquarters on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in downtown Pittsburgh. It was first announced in 2011. The LEED Platinum building, owned by PNC and designed by Gensler, won awards for its environmentally friendly features.

In April 2017, the company acquired the U.S. equipment finance business of ECN Capital for $1.3 billion.

In November 2017, the company acquired The Trout Group, an investor relations and strategic advisory firm servicing the healthcare industry.

In 2018, the company acquired Fortis Advisors, which provides postmerger shareholder services. The company ranked one hundred sixty fifth on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.

In 2018, PNC began opening &quot;Solution Centers&quot;, a hybrid between traditional bank branches and ATMonly services, mostly serving new markets. Through this method, PNC expanded its retail footprint into Boston, Denver, Kansas City, Nashville, and several markets in Texas including Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. Two of PNC&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot; competitors, Bank of America and Chase Bank, have both also been expanding into new markets through this method, including into PNC&#x27;s home market of Pittsburgh.

In August 2019, PNC launched a Fintech incubator subsidiary called &quot;numo&quot; that functions as an internal startup. Its first development included indi, an instant payment and mobile banking company for gig workers.

In May 2020, the company sold its stake in BlackRock.

On June 1, 2021, PNC acquired BBVA USA for $11.6 billion in cash. The acquisition significantly boosted its presence in Colorado and Texas, complemented its presence in Alabama and Florida, and introduced the bank to the Arizona, California, and New Mexico markets.

In 2021, PNC originated nearly 95,000 mortgages worth $34.8 billion. This is a 23% increase vs prior year and stands as their highest origination volume to date.

==Legal issues==
===Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City===
In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008, before the acquisition by PNC. Regulators claimed that National City had violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City&#x27;s lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million.

=== Retailer breach forced PNC to reissue customer cards ===
In March 2006, PNC and other large banks were forced to reissue hundreds of debit cards to customers after card numbers were disclosed by a breach at an unspecified retailer.

===Lawsuit from Military Channel===
Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an investor in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let the chairman of the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the company&#x27;s account for personal use.

===Securities fraud settlement===

In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors.

===Overtime claim by loan officers===
In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

===National Prearranged Services fraud===
According to a lawsuit, funds entrusted to National Prearranged Services (NPS), a St. Louisbased company that sold prepaid funerals, were diverted and embezzled. PNC Bank is the successor to Allegiant Bank, which served as a trustee for NPS from 1998 to 2004. In 2015, a jury ordered PNC to pay $391 million. In 2017, a federal judge overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. In 2021, a $106 million judgement was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit. 
===Municipal bonds disclosure violations===
In 2015, PNC was one of 22 companies that violated disclosure requirements for municipal bonds by failing to divulge that the issuers had filed late financial reports. It was fined $500,000.

==Controversies==
===Funding of mountaintop removal mining===
Beginning in 2010, until it changed its policy in February 2015, PNC was the subject of protests by the Earth Quaker Action Team, led by George Lakey, and the Rainforest Action Network due to its funding of companies engaged in mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia. The protests included political demonstrations at branches and offices and the annual general meeting, fasting, and boycotts.

===Cancelling MxM News Financial Accounts===
On Mar 2, 2023, Donald Trump Jr., cofounder of news aggregator MxM News, tweeted that PNC had abruptly cancelled all financial services for MxM without explanation. Trump and cofounder Taylor Budowich alleged that PNC disapproved of Trump’s political leanings since no reason was given for the closure. PNC claimed it was a “good faith error” and reopened the account.

<doc id="1265490" wikidata="Q4772083" url="?curid=1265490" title="Anthony Beale">
<text>Anthony A. Beale (born October 22, 1967) is an American politician and the alderman of the 9th ward of the City of Chicago, Illinois United States. Beale is noted as having been one of the youngest members to serve as elected official on the City of Chicago&#x27;s City Council. Beale was first elected in 1999. In 2023 Beale was elected to his seventh term in office. In 2013, Beale was an unsuccessful candidate in the Democratic primary for the special election to replace Jesse Jackson Jr. as U.S. Congressman from Illinois&#x27; 2nd congressional district.

==Education==
Beale attended Corliss High School, graduating in 1985. Beale later attended Blackburn College.

Beale worked as a computer data analyst. He was also a community activist under Jesse Jackson Jr. and James Meeks. Beale supported an effort in 1999 to adopt dry laws in some precincts of the 9th ward.

==Aldermanic career==
Beale was elected alderman for the 9th ward in 1999. He has been reelected in 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2023.

In his 1999 victory, backed by Jesse Jackson Jr. and James Meeks, he defeated Herbert Shaw, the son of Robert Shaw, who had vacated the 9th ward seat himself months earlier after being elected to serve on the Cook County Board of Review. Beale&#x27;s 1999 victory was considered an upset.

Beale was part of a backroom deal to bring additional Walmart locations to Chicago.

Beale proposed using taxpayer money to hire private security patrols for commercial districts.

Beale was previously Chairman of the Committee on Transportation &amp; Infrastructure. As of 2011, he was a member of the following City Council Committees:
*Budget &amp; Government Operations
*Rules and Ethics
*Workforce Development &amp; Audit
*Education &amp; Child Development
*Finance 
*Public Safety

During his tenure as Alderman, Beale has focused on job creation and housing for seniors. Beale has helped bring in new businesses that have created over 4,000 new jobs in the Ward. Beale has also brought in more government subsidized senior housing than any previous alderman.

In 2008 Beale spent more of his aldermanic expense account than any other alderman on public relations, with more than $16,000 paid to The Publicity Works, a company owned by longtime Democratic political consultant Delmarie Cobb. Beale said the company handles media inquiries and puts together his ward newsletter, among other duties.
In February 2012, the Chicago Dispatcher reported that Beale attended a fundraiser in his honor held by members of Chicago&#x27;s taxicab industry just five days before legislation governing the industry was to be heard, which he and Mayor Rahm Emanuel introduced. The Chicago Dispatcher also reported that certain provisions of the legislation changed just prior to the hearing, which were favorable to taxicab operators who threw the fundraiser.

In the runoff of the 2019 Chicago mayoral election, Beale endorsed Lori Lightfoot.

In November 2019, Beale was one of eleven aldermen to vote against Mayor Lori Lightfoot&#x27;s first budget.

After he tried to organize opposition to Lightfoot&#x27;s choice for Finance Committee chairman, Scott Waguespack, he was stripped of his own committee chairmanship. Beale has become a regular critic of Lightfoot, and particularly has opposed her attempts to scale back the practice of aldermanic prerogative.

==9th ward Committeeperson==
In 2000, Beale defeated Robert Shaw to become the 9th Ward&#x27;s committeeman. Beale continues to serve as its committeeperson, having been reelected in 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020.

==Public Service==
Beale has taken part in various civic organizations, including the Board for Redevelopment of the Roseland area; he served as President of the 100th Street of Prairie Block Club of Roseland; and as Acting Vice President of the United Block Club of Roseland. Additionally, he is an active member of the Rosemoor Community Association, the 5th District Advisory Committee, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS), Roseland Redevelopment Ad Hoc Committee and Salem Baptist Church. Beale was a candidate in the 2013 Democratic primary in Illinois&#x27; 2nd congressional district to replace resigning convicted U.S. Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. Beale finished third with 11% of the vote behind former Illinois House of Representatives member Robin Kelly (52%) and former U.S. Representative Debbie Halvorson (25%); in Beale&#x27;s home 9th ward, Kelly (50%) bested Beale (34%).

==Personal life==
Beale currently lives in the Roseland neighborhood with his wife, Dana, and their three children. Beale attends and serves as a member of Salem Baptist Church.

===Whitney Young High School incident===
On August 24, 2009, Beale became the second alderman to concede his daughter was admitted to Whitney Young High School, an elite magnet high school in 2004. The admittance occurred after Beale called principal Joyce Kenner, who admitted to having a personal relationship with Beale.

<doc id="1265491" wikidata="Q56761" url="?curid=1265491" title="Angami language">
<text>Angami, also known as Tenyidie, is a Naga language spoken in the Naga Hills in the northeastern part of India, in Kohima district, Nagaland. In 2011, there is an estimate of 153,000 first language (L1) Angami speakers. Under the UNESCO&#x27;s Language Vitality and Endangerment framework, Angami is at the level of &quot;vulnerable&quot;, meaning that it is still spoken by most children, but &quot;may be restricted to certain domains&quot;.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
This table represents the consonantal structure of the Khonoma dialect.

Other dialects also contrast . only occurs as an allophone of . The velar fricative is in free variation with . The post-alveolar approximants are truly retroflex (sub-apical) before mid and low vowels, but laminal before high vowels ().

Angami voiceless nasals are unusual in that, unlike the voiceless nasals of Burmese, they have a positive rather than negative voice onset time—that is, they are aspirated rather than partially voiced. The same is true of the laterals. In both cases, the aspiration has the formants characteristic of Angami &quot;h,&quot; which is somewhat velar in pronunciation. The other voiceless approximants may not be aspirated, as the h-like formants occur during the entire hold of the consonant.

=== Vowels ===
The following are the vowels of the Khonoma dialect.

The labial and labialized consonants have labiodental affricate allophones before (but not in consonant clusters). In addition, about half the time, the rhotic becomes syllabic (a rhotic vowel) in this environment:

Angami syllables may be of the form V, CV, or . Attested clusters are .

==Phonological reconstruction==
Meyase (2023) recognizes southern, northern, and western dialects of Angami, including the following.

*Southern: Jokha, Kiwe
*Northern: Kewhi
*Western: Khwüno

Preliminary Proto-Tenyi lexical reconstructions by Meyase (2023), with supporting data from four Tenyidie dialects, are as follows.

Northern sound change innovations include:
* *kw &gt; pf, f
* *o &gt; uo, io

Southern sound change innovations include:
* *pe- &gt; me-

== Grammar and lexicon ==
A wealth of Angami grammars, lexicons are available in Tenyidie and in English. However, these collections often 
conflict in their analysis of the phonemic or syntactic nature of the language. This is due to the difference at the time 
of the documentation, and the choice of informants from varying dialect. Especially in the earlier language 
documentations (1870s–1960s), mostly by Christian missionary; their informants&#x27; meta-data were not specified and 
any dialect of Angami were assumed to be the &quot;standard&quot; of Angami within the Nagaland region. The Angami-English Phrasebook and Angami-English-Hindi dictionary available online.

== Text collection ==
The complete Tenyidie bible was published in 1970. However, only the translated chapter of Genesis from the bible was posted on the internet under The Rosetta Project. Also, Christian devotional materials such as The Bible...Basically® in Tenyidie are also available online.

Another source of text is largely from the ethnic folktales (e.g. Angami Naga folklore by Sekhose, 1970) and 
especially from song lyrics written in Tenyidie. Other than Christian songs written by the Angami church community 
(e.g. Shieshülie songbook by Baptist Revival Church), the rising rock music culture started to stir in the Nagaland as the music events and societies like the Hornbill National Rock Contest 

The next largest source of Tenyidie is the educational materials used in the Kohima schools and university. 
Although much of these texts are in printed forms, a query on the web does retrieve some Indian exams papers that contain test questions on Tenyidie.

<doc id="1265494" wikidata="Q5407740" url="?curid=1265494" title="Eugene Schulter">
<text>Gene Schulter (born November 14, 1947) was alderman of the 47th ward of the City of Chicago. He was first elected in 1975 and served until his retirement in 2011.

== Early life ==
Schulter is the youngest of five children, all raised in Chicago. He attended John Audubon School and later graduated from Lake View High School in 1965. Schulter earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Loyola University. He was also awarded a Law Degree. Schulter also earned a post graduate degree from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

== Aldermanic career ==
In 1975, Schulter was recruited by 47th Ward Committeeman and Chicago Park District Superintendent Ed Kelly to run for City Council in the ward against John J. Hoellen Jr., a foe of mayor Richard J. Daley who was also running against Daley in the coinciding mayoral election. He won the election. He was only 26, making him one of the youngest aldermen to serve in the city council.

As alderman, Schulter worked for license reform. Schulter is responsible for legislation that guaranteed equitable citywide cable services and set asides for minorities; he led the drive for more community input on parks; and sponsored the city&#x27;s Landscape Oridnance which requires the incorporation of landscape plans and planting of trees for every new residential, commercial, or industrial development.

Schulter highlighted the Sulzer Regional Library as a major ward achievement. Also, he worked to build a field house at Chase Park, fostered revitalization of Lincoln Square Mall, and supported the development of the Ravenswood Industrial Corridor.

During his tenure, Schulter was chairman of the Committee on License and Consumer Protection. He served on six other committees: Budget and Government Relations; Finance; Committees, Rules and Ethics; Traffic Control and Safety; Zoning; and Parks and Recreation.

In 2008, Schulter expended a portion of his aldermanic expense account as a salary for his daughter, Monica. A city ordinance prohibits the spending of aldermanic expense funds for &quot;the direct monetary benefit of any alderman or any of his or her relatives.&quot;

In 2011, Schulter announced his retirement from the city council. The open seat was subsequently won by Ameya Pawar. Pawar gained under 51% of all votes cast, narrowly avoiding a runoff against Schulter ally Tom O&#x27;Donnell.

== Professional career ==
Schulter is a paid director of North Community Bank, a bank in Chicago with locations in the 47th ward.

== Personal life ==
Schulter is married to Rosemary. They have two children together.

<doc id="1265497" wikidata="Q6778915" url="?curid=1265497" title="Mary Ann Smith">
<text>Mary Ann Smith (November 2, 1946 – July 31, 2024) was an alderman of the 48th ward of the City of Chicago; she was appointed in 1989 by Mayor Richard M. Daley to replace Kathy Osterman. She won re-election in 1991, and was re-elected four more times before retiring in 2011. She served as a member of the Chicago Commission on Landmarks.

== Early life ==
Smith attended the now-defunct College of Saint Teresa from 1964 until 1967, and later earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Mundelein College, now a part of Loyola University Chicago, as an undergraduate student. She and her husband lived in the Chicago neighborhoods Edgewater and Uptown beginning in 1974. Her engagement with ward politics began with her involvement in the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO), during which time she worked with activists Marion Volini and Kathy Osterman, who would both become alderwomen of the 48th ward.

== Aldermanic career ==
Smith became a Chicago alderman in 1989, being appointed by Mayor Richard M. Daley. She was reelected in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007. In 2010, she announced that she would not be seeking reelection in 2011, thus ending her tenure as alderman.

Smith earned a United Nations Programme Award for Citizen Action to Protect the Global Environment. She worked with the Chicago Park District to restructure their department and provide more recreational access to all Chicagoans. Smith is on the Advisory Council on Chicago Green Development.

In 2000, Smith helped organize the funding for Walkable Edgewater. Smith earned an award from the Chicago Civic Federation and a Soles and Spokes award from the Chicago Area Transportation Study.

Smith was an early supporter of the Human Rights Ordinance and the Domestic Partner Ordinance.

In 2005 Smith was instrumental in the controversial decision to open Rickover Naval Academy in the facilities of Senn High School. This decision met with intense opposition from residents and anti-war activists concerned about military recruitment of the community&#x27;s poor.

Smith worked with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to draft the proposed Elephant Protection Ordinance, which if adopted would mandate humane treatment of elephants within the city. After two unsuccessful attempts at passage, Smith on December 16, 2009, for the third time introduced the ordinance.

In 2007 Smith ran unopposed for re-election to a fifth term after Smith got two of her supporters, Susanne J. Henning and Albert L. Lewis, to file with the Chicago Board of Elections objections to her opponent&#x27;s nominating paperwork.

Smith was one of the top three alderman lagging in spending so-called &quot;aldermanic menu&quot; funds, which allows aldermen to choose from a menu of street, sidewalk, alley and anti-crime improvements.

Smith appeared in the documentary about Chicago&#x27;s Uptown Theatre.

On July 2, 2010, in response to the overturning of the Chicago handgun ban by the Supreme Court, she said &quot;that law was written for militias and, &quot;they guaranteed the right to carry around muskets not Uzis.&quot;

==Honors==
Smith earned a United Nations Programme Award for Citizen Action to Protect the Global Environment, an award from the Chicago Civic Federation, and a Soles and Spokes award from the Chicago Area Transportation Study.

In 1997 Smith was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community.

== Personal life ==
Smith&#x27;s husband, Robert C. Smith, was a professor at John Marshall Law School. He died in 2018. They have two sons, Michael Smith, a Portland, OR based Democratic delegate and Matthew Smith, a Chicago-area psychotherapist.

<doc id="1265504" wikidata="Q4894400" url="?curid=1265504" title="Bernie Hansen">
<text>Bernie Hansen (November 26, 1944 – July 18, 2021) was a longtime Chicago alderman, serving on the Chicago City Council from 1983 to 2002, when he retired as alderman of the 44th Ward citing health reasons. He was a Democrat.

Hansen was elected to the Chicago City Council in 1983 when the incumbent alderman, John Merlo, retired. In 1987 he defeated Dr. Ron Sable, a liberal gay activist, by a 52% to 47% margin in the race for 44th Ward alderman. It was a hard-fought campaign in the city&#x27;s 44th Ward, which at the time was the heart of the city&#x27;s gay community. Sable ran against Hansen again in 1991, but Hansen prevailed again, 65% to 35%.

From 1994 to 2000, he served as one of four U.S. commissioners to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a presidential appointment to a bilateral treaty organization with Canada responsible for fisheries management research and recommendations and for sea lamprey control for the Great Lakes fisheries. For part of that time, he chaired the commission.

During Council Wars Hansen was generally aligned with the &quot;Vrdolyak 29,&quot; the block of mostly white aldermen who opposed Mayor Harold Washington. He sponsored or co-sponsored several human rights ordinances, including the Human Rights Ordinance expanding protection against discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodations, and credit to gay males, lesbians, and persons with disabilities, an ordinance to assist victims of hate crimes, and a 1997 ordinance Hansen introduced to extend health-care benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian city employees. Thomas M. Tunney, his successor as 44th Ward alderman whom Hansen had &quot;hand-picked&quot;, became Chicago&#x27;s first openly gay alderman.

Hansen was also an active proponent of environmentalist measures, including recycling programs and the extension of Chicago&#x27;s moratorium against the creation of new landfills.

Some residents of the Lakeview community voiced concern that Hansen was more concerned with building expensive condos and co-ops, then re-building the neighborhood with affordable housing during his tenure. He served on the board of many community councils as well as fund raising organizations, including the John Merlo Sports Program.

After his retirement from the city council, he continued to serve as Democratic committeeman from the 44th Ward, ultimately handing over the title to Alderman Tom Tunney. John Merlo held the position from 1969 to 1992.

Hansen made an attempt to be a Democratic Congressional Candidate for Illinois&#x27;s 5th congressional district in 2002, but when the Democratic National Committee backed Clinton Administration staffer Rahm Emanuel in the race, Hansen withdrew and soon after resigned from the 44th Ward Aldermanic seat.

He was married to Annette and had two sons, Paul and David. He had two grandchildren. He attended the University of Chicago and had residences in both Chicago and Arizona. He was a longtime Chicago Cubs fan and avid golfer.

<text>Thomas M. Tunney (born August 22, 1955) is an American politician and entrepreneur from Chicago, Illinois. From 2003 to 2023, he served as an alderman on the Chicago City Council. He represented the 44th Ward of the city, which includes major tourist destinations, Northalsted and Wrigleyville neighborhoods. He was also vice mayor from 2019 to 2023.

==Education==
Tunney was born and raised in the southwest side of Chicago. After graduating from Brother Rice, a local Catholic high school, he attended the University of Illinois where he obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in restaurant management. Tunney succeeded in obtaining a master&#x27;s degree in hotel administration from Cornell University.

==Entrepreneur==
Returning from college, Tunney moved into the Lakeview neighborhood. Hearing that Ann Sather was retiring and closing her restaurant in Lakeview in 1981, Tunney met with Sather, offering a proposal to purchase her business. Tunney gained full ownership of the Ann Sather Restaurant and expanded it into a successful local chain.

Tunney joined several prestigious entrepreneurial circles and became chairman of the Illinois Restaurant Association. He founded and led the Lakeview Center Business Association and White Crane Wellness Center. As a result of his success, Tunney was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Public service==
Tunney opened his restaurants to grassroots and nonprofit organizations as town halls, serving as free meeting places. He committed himself to helping people with HIV and AIDS through programs he created, adopted by the Illinois Masonic Hospital. With a growing business network, Tunney became a fundraiser for local gay and lesbian political advocacy groups.

Tunney chaired the small business subcommittee of the Chicago Economic Development Committee. Mayor Richard M. Daley appointed Tunney to the mayor&#x27;s Parking Task Force.

==Alderman==
In 2002, just months before the 2003 municipal elections, 44th Ward Alderman Bernie Hansen announced that he would retire. Hansen resigned just months before the election so as to allow the mayor to appoint the replacement alderman. Mayor Richard M. Daley, with Hansen&#x27;s consent, nominated Tunney to replace Hansen in December 2002. Tunney&#x27;s nomination was confirmed by a 41–0 vote of the city council on January 16, 2003, and, with wide support in the Democratic Party, Tunney was elected to a four-year term as alderman on February 25, 2003. He has been re-elected four times, in 2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019.

During his campaign Tunney claimed that he would address the potential conflict of interest which would arise through his business arrangements by selling his interest in four restaurants. After being elected and sworn in, Tunney decided not to sell.

Tunney introduced an ordinance repealing Chicago&#x27;s ban on foie gras in July 2007 and spearheaded passage of the repeal on May 14, 2008.

Tunney considered running for mayor in 2011, but ultimately did not.

In 2013, Tunney denied unattributed published reports that he supported moving or demolish the iconic scoreboard at Wrigley Field to clear the view for nearby rooftops owners.

Tunney has had an often adversarial relationship with the Ricketts family, current owners of the Chicago Cubs, whose stadium, Wrigley Field, is located in his ward. The Ricketts family has accused Tunney of being, &quot;needlessly disrespectful&quot; in negotiations with them about the redevelopment of Wrigley Field. Cubs chairman Thomas S. Ricketts has publicly criticized Tunney.

Tunney considered running for mayor in 2019, but ultimately did not. In the runoff of the election, Tunney endorsed Lori Lightfoot.

On May 17, three days prior to her inauguration as mayor, Lightfoot tapped Tunney to serve as both vice mayor and chairman of the Council&#x27;s Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards. On May 29, 2019, Tunney was formally appointed as chairman of the Council&#x27;s Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards.

In August 2022, Tunney announced that he would not run for an additional term on the Chicago City Council in 2023. Tunney considered challenging Mayor Lightfoot for mayor in the 2023 Chicago mayoral election, going as far as collecting signatures for a ballot petition. However, Tunney decided not to run and ultimately endorsed Paul Vallas ahead of the election&#x27;s first round. Tunney has indicated that after leaving the City Council he intends to advocate of behalf the city&#x27;s business community.

==Personal life==
Tunney is the cousin of actress Robin Tunney, who played Agent Lisbon on &quot;The Mentalist&quot;.

Tunney was the first openly gay Chicago Alderman.

<text>Tony Ageh OBE, (born 23rd December, 1959) was until 2023 the New York Public Library&#x27;s Chief Digital Officer having previously been Controller of Archive Development at the BBC.

His first job as a school leaver was production assistant on &quot;Home Organist&quot;, working for Richard Desmond, subsequently the proprietor of Express Newspapers.

He then moved to Publishing Holdings, which owned list titles including &quot;What Mortgage&quot; and &quot;What Telephone&quot;. With four colleagues he set up and ran publishing co-operative Brass Tacks, publishers of &quot;Mortgage Magazine&quot;, during which time he helped football fanzine &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot; to gain national distribution and upgrade its production to magazine quality. Also during the 1980s he joined Richard Branson&#x27;s short-lived London listings magazine, &quot;Event&quot;, set up while &quot;Time Out&quot; journalists were on strike, then became publisher of &quot;City Limits&quot; magazine, rival to listings magazine &quot;Time Out&quot;, which eventually ceased publication in 1993.

He was invited to join the Guardian Media Group in 1990 by Jim Markwick, then managing director. By the mid-1990s he was head of product development at &quot;The Guardian&quot; where he launched &quot;The Guide&quot;, a listings supplement, &quot;Wired UK&quot; and introduced online content to a UK national newspaper for the first time. From &quot;The Guardian&quot; he rejoined Branson to work on the launch of virgin.net, originally a portal for the Virgin group of companies, now part of Virgin Media.

He joined the BBC after quitting the UK listings and information service UpMyStreet in 2002. At the BBC he led the team which devised and developed the BBC iPlayer, which necessitated no fewer than 84 internal BBC presentations. In October 2008 he was appointed as the Controller of BBC Archive Development in which he championed the public service use of the BBC&#x27;s archive through products such as BBC Genome and The research and education space (RES) built in partnership with JISC and the British Universities Film &amp; Video Council, working with former Guardian colleague Bill Thompson

He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours.

<doc id="1265514" wikidata="Q7147015" url="?curid=1265514" title="Patrick Levar">
<text>Patrick Levar (born c. 1951) is the former alderman of the 45th ward of the City of Chicago.

==Early life==
Levar is a graduate of St. Patrick&#x27;s High School (1969) and Northeastern Illinois University (1973). Before becoming Alderman Levar worked as an assistant to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County from 1974 until 1987.

==Alderman==
Levar was one of the so-called &quot;Vrdolyak 29&quot; opponents to Mayor Harold Washington.

Levar remains widely despised in the district he represented, largely due to his unethical behavior and shakedown of area businesses for free products in exchange for favorable treatment. He controlled three political action committees: Citizens to Re-elect Patrick J Levar, the 45th Ward Regular Democratic Organization, and the Patrick J Levar 45th Ward Committeeman Fund.

Alderman Levar was Chairman of the Committee on Aviation of the Chicago City Council. Levar was chairman of the Aviation Committee since the early 1990s, while his brother Michael was a top city official in charge of O&#x27;Hare International Airport construction contracts until Michael retired from his city job in 2004. Michael Levar was a focus of a massive investigation of city aviation deals looking into possible women- and minority-owned business fraud and into campaign contributions from airport contractors to Alderman Levar.

Levar unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County in 2000.

<doc id="1265515" wikidata="Q5703149" url="?curid=1265515" title="Helen Shiller">
<text>Helen Shiller (born 1947) is a former Alderman of the 46th ward in Chicago, Illinois. Shiller is also a published author, having written a 500-page book on her politics and activism in Chicago from 1971 to 2011. Shiller served in the Chicago City Council for six four-year terms, from 1987 to 2011. Shiller was elected to the City Council on her third attempt, as Harold Washington, Chicago&#x27;s first black Mayor, was re-elected to his second term, and her election as alderman helped close the Council Wars era in Chicago government. Shiller has been described as &quot;a reformer unafraid to take on the boys in power.&quot; A less flattering description is that she is &quot;committed to liberal causes and destroying all within her path&quot;. Among her most significant impacts on Chicago were her advocacy for diverse, inclusive, affordable housing and helping craft Chicago&#x27;s response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Her commitment to fostering community development without displacement often brought Shiller into contention with some constituencies, real estate developers, and editorial boards. Shiller&#x27;s oral history was collected by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Uptown resident Studs Terkel in his 2003 book, &quot;Hope Dies Last&quot;. As she details in her own book, among her policy victories as a City Council member was: getting human rights legislation passed, having Chicago implement anti-apartheid legislation, creating a City Council Subcommittee on Domestic Violence, and building a unique mix-used development.

== Early life and education ==

Shiller was born in 1947 and raised on Long Island in New York, growing up in a middle-class family. Her parents were home owners. Her father, Morris Shiller, was a self-employed chemist who emigrated to the United States from Latvia. Some members of his family were Holocaust victims. Shiller&#x27;s mother was Sara (née Trop), Sara was born and raised in Belarus, where she lived through various occupations, including by the Germans, Polish, Russians, and Soviet Union. Sara came to America through Ellis Island at the age of six. She became a nurse and married Morris, in 1936. She died at the age of 96 in the summer of 2011.

Helen Shiller earned her high school diploma in 1965 from Woodstock County School in Vermont, the same progressive boarding school that Pete Seeger&#x27;s children attended. Shiller graduated with a degree in history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where she was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement and in the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). In 2005, Shiller graduated from DePaul University&#x27;s School for New Learning Master&#x27;s Program, where her focus was public policy.

== Early career ==

Shiller moved to Chicago&#x27;s Uptown neighborhood in 1972 with her husband Marc Zalkin and her infant son, Brendan, and lived on N Malden Street in Uptown. Shiller drove a cab, worked as a waitress and freelance photographer, and got involved in radical politics. With one of Chicago&#x27;s most controversial political organizers, Walter &quot;Slim&quot; Coleman, Shiller helped organize the Intercommunal Survival Committee, a sort of white support arm of the Black Panther Party. The committee evolved into the Heart of Uptown Coalition, a political and social service organization steeped in the rhetoric of Marxism; &quot;comrades&quot; were expected to organize &quot;cadres.&quot; &quot;We must have the frame of mind that as revolutionaries we have (to) be able to solve any problem that comes our way ...&quot; Shiller said. The Coalition provided an array of programs geared toward providing essential services for the poor, including medical clinics for pregnant women, mothers and young children; a legal aid clinic, food pantries and distributing clothes and meals to the poor. For decades Shiller and her allies worked to preserve Uptown as the last North Side lakefront neighborhood south of Rogers Park that is home to a significant population of low income households.

Shiller supported Michael Bakalis in his 1978 primary challenge to Illinois Governor James R. Thompson, attacking Thompson for &quot;making deals with the Chicago machine&quot; and for being unsympathetic to the urban poor. Shiller helped open an extension of Shimer College at 4833 N Broadway in the Fall of 1978. Shiller took on Illinois&#x27; dentists when in 1978 the Uptown Peoples Community Services Center joined consumers groups in a federal lawsuit which attempted to break up dentists&#x27; monopoly on fitting dentures. From 1981 to 1987, Shiller was president and CEO of Justice Graphics, Inc. a print shop, a small business of which Shiller and Coleman were two of five owners.

In 2003 Shiller recalled the period:

I was as student in the sixties, engaged in the civil rights movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I&#x27;d come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an exciting time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.

==Campaigns for alderman==

=== First campaign for alderman (1978) ===

A special election was called for May 16, 1978 in the 46th Ward when Alderman Chris Cohen, first elected in 1971, was re-elected in 1975 but retired in mid-term to head the Chicago regional office of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. On March 6, 1978, Ralph Axelrod, chief administrative assistant to Cook County Sheriff Richard Elrod, and ward committeeman since 1973, slated himself for alderman.

At the time, Shiller was 30 years old and the editor of &quot;Keep Strong&quot;, a leftist magazine. Shiller&#x27;s first attempt at elected office was to join a multi-way challenge to Axelrod. &quot;I ran for alderman of this [46th] ward in 1978. I was terrified. I was very shy, afraid to speak to more than five people at a time,&quot; Shiller recalled in 2003. Shiller picked up much of the support that Young Lords founder and leader Jose Cha Cha Jimenez had in Jimenez&#x27; unsuccessful challenge to Cohen in the 1975 elections. He was running primarily as a defence against the FBI&#x27;s CointelPro repressive program and to expose the displacement of Latino and lower income areas from the lakefront and near downtown by the Richard J. Daley machine. He still received 39% of the vote coming in second in a three-way race. Shiller&#x27;s base of support was the same geographic center of the ward, an area of high density, low-income families between Broadway and Clark Street. Shiller campaigned pledging to work to keep the disadvantaged of Uptown from being displaced by gentrification.

Independents including Aldermen Dick Simpson (44th), Martin J. Oberman (43rd), and Ross Lathrop (5th), and former alderman and mayoral candidate William Singer (43rd), endorsed Angela Turley, founder of the Organization of the Northeast (ONE), a community group. Turley was also unanimously endorsed by the 46th Ward Citizens Search Committee, a group of 50 ward residents who interviewed 10 candidates. Turley and another candidate Carl Lezak, a former priest and former director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), were challenged and stricken from the ballot by the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners, leaving a three-way race for alderman between Axelrod, Shiller, and former television news reporter Michael Horowitz. Shiller charged that the regular Democratic organization used unfair campaign practices against her, challenging about 100 of the 400 new voters she helped register, stealing her campaign posters, and pressuring store owners to remove her signs. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; endorsed Axelrod, noting Shiller &quot;runs primarily as a champion of the poor.&quot; Axelrod prevailed, receiving 5,575 votes, or 54.5%, to Shiller&#x27;s 3,475 votes.

===Second campaign for alderman (1979)===

Shiller and Turley challenged Axelrod in 1979. An extra alarm fire early on Friday, February 9, 1979, weeks before the election, caused extensive damage to the building containing Shiller&#x27;s campaign headquarters and left 15 homeless. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; endorsed Axelrod. Shiller (6,852 votes; 46%) bested Axelrod (6,088 votes; 40%), but, as no candidate received a majority of the vote in the three-way race, a run-off was forced. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and Turley endorsed Axelrod in the run-off. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;Ms. Shiller&#x27;s program shares many elements with that of the Black Panthers and appears to be based on hopes of an eventual &quot;revolution&quot; [not defined].&quot; Turley described Axelrod as &quot;the lesser of two evils in the race now.&quot; Axelrod enlisted 40 volunteer attorneys and 200 off-duty policemen to challenge ghost voting in a project he called &quot;Operation Safeguard.&quot; Axelrod challenged 1,060 voter registrations on the ward&#x27;s rolls, 931 of which were upheld by the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners. Axelrod defeated Shiller in the run-off by 247 votes. Shiller later recalled the campaign:

I won the primary, but not with fifty-one percent of the vote. We had a runoff and I lost by two hundred votes – to a machine candidate. We were bringing fresh ideas, but we were not experienced in fighting the machine on election day. I swore I&#x27;d never run for alderman again. There was so much racial baiting that it was terrifying. I was called names. ... My posters had black paint all over them with racial epithets. It was very disturbing.

===Third campaign for alderman (1987)===

In Harold Washington&#x27;s successful first campaign for Mayor of Chicago in the 1983 municipal elections, Shiller was employed as the campaign organizer for the 46th Ward. Shiller owned and operated a print shop, Justice Graphics, that printed the campaign literature for Washington&#x27;s first mayoral campaign. Justice Graphics published the &quot;All-Chicago City News&quot;, a 40,000 circulation pro-Washington, left-wing, bilingual, biweekly newspaper edited by Shiller and Walter &quot;Slim&quot; Coleman. Coleman formed a plan to register 100,000 new voters for Washington by canvassing public aid offices and became a close advisor to candidate and, later, Mayor Harold Washington. Just before the 1983 elections, Alderman Axelrod resigned from City Council to take a job in the Cook County Sheriff&#x27;s office. Community activist Charlotte Newfeld and Jerome Orbach ran for alderman and went to a run-off, which Orbach won by 66 votes. Orbach allied with Edward Vrdolyak and the Vrdolyak 29 during Council Wars.

&quot;Harold was mayor, and he was harping on me to run for alderman,&quot; Shiller recalled in 2003. In 1987, Shiller, Nancy Kaszak, and Gerald Pechenuk challenged Orbach. Kaszak was a lawyer, a former vice president of the Chicago Council of Lawyers, a Mayor Harold Washington appointee to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, a leader of the Lakeview Citizens&#x27; Council, and president of Citizens United for Baseball in Sunshine (CUBS), which opposed night baseball at Wrigley Field. Newfeld co-chaired Kaszak&#x27;s campaign. Pechenuk was a consultant for Lyndon LaRouche Jr. for 12 years, and was treasurer of LaRouche-supported Sheila Jones&#x27;s mayoral campaign. Shiller challenged Pechenuk&#x27;s nominating petitions.

Mayor Washington endorsed 18 incumbent aldermen and 5 challengers, including Shiller. Washington appeared at a joint rally with Shiller at which she announced her candidacy. Kaszak was endorsed by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO), the National Organization for Women (NOW), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), and former aldermen William Singer and Dick Simpson. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; endorsed Orbach. Shiller charged that Orbach catered to developers, displacing people in the wake of rehabilitation that priced housing out of the reach of many, and said she wanted community zoning boards, with their decisions binding on the alderman. Shiller charged that most of Orbach&#x27;s campaign war chest was from developers and regular Democrats outside the ward.

In the four-way race, Orbach took 40% of the vote and Shiller 38%, but, no candidate received a majority, resulting in a run-off. Kaszak endorsed Shiller, although many of Kaszak&#x27;s followers supported Orbach. Orbach tried to position himself on both sides of the pro-/anti-Washington political fence, and late in the campaign attempted to stage a public conversion to pro-Washington positions. Some prominent independents, such as Alderman Marion Volini (48th), state Representative Ellis B. Levin and state Senator William A. Marovitz, endorsed Orbach, as did the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. &quot;His [Orbach&#x27;s] relationship to large real estate developers is very important. He&#x27;s become more of an advocate for people outside of the ward than for people here,&quot; Shiller charged. Some of Orbach&#x27;s allies spread a rumor, aimed at lakefront Jewish voters, that as alderman Shiller would support a Palestinian state. Shiller&#x27;s forces called Orbach a racist, although a large number of blacks backed Orbach in his early campaigns. Shiller later said,

The machine alderman who won in 1983 [Orbach] had a chief of staff who was engaging in racial organizing. There were white gangs up here. One of them he helped organize into a consciously racially white-power gang. They hooked up with both the Klan and the Nazi Party.

In the months leading up to the election, the Heart of Uptown Coalition and a Shiller supporter who was director of the Center for Street People, 4455 N. Broadway, organized a voter registration drive that registered 80 homeless people using the center&#x27;s address, and on election day fed them a meal at a local church hall and helped them vote. Jesus People USA, a 500-member commune/business/charity/religious group with many members living in the ward, had supported Orbach throughout his career, but switched to Shiller before the run-off. Jesus People&#x27;s spokesman explained &quot;We think Jerry Orbach is a lovely man, but he doesn&#x27;t have what it takes to stand up to the development ... If things keep going there will be massive displacement. People will be thrown out of their homes. We decided that Helen Shiller would do the most to prevent displacement.&quot; Orbach supporters charged that a City official had offered City contracts to the Jesus People&#x27;s construction firm if Shiller were elected. On Tuesday, April 7, 1987, Shiller defeated Orbach by 498 votes, 9,751 to 9,253, and contributed to a narrow, pro-Washington, reform-minded majority in the City Council which helped draw the Council Wars era to close.

== Aldermanic career ==

In her six terms as alderman, Shiller served on eight committees: Budget and Government Operations; Buildings; Committees, Rules and Ethics; Finance; Health; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations; and License and Consumer Protection.

=== First term (1987–1991) ===

On December 16, 1987, Shiller was among the supporters of the 1988 City budget, proposed by Washington in late 1987 and passed 29-19 under Mayor Eugene Sawyer after Washington&#x27;s death in office. Shiller was among opponents of Sawyer&#x27;s 1989 budget, approved 34–13 on December 7, 1988. In January, 1988, Shiller was named one of &quot;88 People to Watch&quot; by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; staff. Shiller was Mayor Richard M. Daley&#x27;s staunchest opponent in City Council votes in the last three months of 1989, in Daley&#x27;s first year of his first term.

In 1989, Shiller sponsored a resolution creating a sub-committee on Domestic Violence. Shiller backed a group of 50 to 75 people including more than 40 homeless people and six children who erected a &quot;tent city&quot; from doors and wood on a vacant lot at 4425 N. Malden to illustrate the plight of the homeless. On Friday, October 14, 1989, Shiller was among five arrested when police, called by the owner, evicted about 100 protesters from the lot. Shiller was charged with trespassing and spent &quot;about two minutes&quot; in jail before charges were dropped.

==== Uptown Chicago Commission funding ====

In November, 1987, Shiller&#x27;s first budget cycle, she recommended to the Budget Committee that the City cancel a federal grant for the Uptown Chicago Commission (UCC), a 32-year-old community group in Uptown that often contended on issues with the Heart of Uptown Coalition, of which Shiller was co-chairman with Walter &quot;Slim&quot; Coleman. The recommendation came during Budget Committee hearings on the distribution of $95.1 million in federal Community Development Block Grants. Mayor Washington&#x27;s budget recommendation included a $20,000 grant to UCC to facilitate residents applying for home improvement loans. The UCC&#x27;s service area included the adjoining 48th Ward, whose Alderman Kathy Osterman also supported the funding. Shiller requested that the committee deny the UCC its grant. Shiller accused the UCC of helping developers displace low-income Uptown residents. After heated debate, the Budget Committee voted 9–5 in favor of Shiller&#x27;s amendment to remove the grant for the UCC.

Upon the death of Mayor Washington in office, Shiller supported Alderman Timothy C. Evans for mayor, but supporters of Alderman Eugene Sawyer prevailed. Weeks later, at the first City Council meeting under Mayor Sawyer, the UCC funding was restored. Shiller said restoring the grant to the UCC would affect only the 48th Ward, not her ward. &quot;I was not going to have them operating in the 46th,&quot; Shiller said, claiming she had reached an agreement to keep UCC services out of her ward several days before Washington&#x27;s death. &quot;Mayor Sawyer had nothing to do with this,&quot; Shiller claimed. &quot;He had recommended no changes.&quot;

==== Low-income housing consent decree ====

As early as 1966 Uptown was among the possible sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district. The Uptown site west of the Wilson Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by those concerned for the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was mired in heated controversy for decades. &quot;Avery v Pierce&quot;, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units for the development of Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago Housing Authority. Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller&#x27;s former campaign manager, attorney James P. Chapman of the Uptown Peoples Law Center.

In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young real estate developer active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided the creation of a local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for sale by auction by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county&#x27;s scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the city for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the county&#x27;s no-cash sales program was &quot;designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible – not for land-banking. It&#x27;s not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they intend to do and how they plan to pay for it.&quot; Another commissioner noted that the City already owned 7,000 tax-delinquent properties, and another added, &quot;Properties we gave to the city 12 years ago are still war zones. I don&#x27;t want the same thing to happen here.&quot;

As a bench ruling in &quot;Avery v Pierce&quot; neared, Shiller proposed an ordinance that directed the city to settle and accept a consent decree. The consent decree would have put most vacant parcels in Uptown into a land bank for future affordable housing, administered by a community development corporation, funded by the city with $100,000 over two years. The consent decree also would have made a &quot;desirable&quot; goal of 3,000 low-income housing units in Uptown. On November 16, 1987, the Committee on Finance of the Chicago City Council, chaired at the time by Shiller ally Alderman Timothy Evans, voted 21 to 2 to recommend the consent decree. Shiller gloated during committee hearings that, with Mayor Harold Washington&#x27;s backing, the decree could not be stopped. Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator Mike Royko wrote in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;:

One of the most depressing sections of Chicago is the Uptown area on the North Side. Shabby apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers. It also has a new alderman, Helen Shiller, and she has a vision of what that seedy old neighborhood should be in the future. And apparently her vision is that Uptown should remain a seedy old neighborhood.

In 1988 Royko wrote of Shiller, &quot;her main motive was that she was building a political power base, which included as many winos as she and Coleman could drag to the voting booth.&quot; Shiller&#x27;s proposal was criticized in a series of editorials. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the proposal &quot;silly,&quot; editorializing:

It would have enabled her [Shiller] to strangle commercial development in her Uptown ward and keep it poor. ... It was a flagrantly bad idea and deserved its defeat. It would have put Helen Shiller and her sidekick, Slim Coleman, in charge of a &quot;community development corporation&quot; whose avowed purpose would be to block private investment in the 46th Ward and use all available space for low-cost housing. This would consolidate their own power by ensuring a constituency of poor and dependent voters.

In 2003 Shiller explained the editorials:

When I first became alderman, there was a developer up here who felt very threatened by me. He hired a publicist to really go after me. Any time I talked about development without displacement, they would ream me. They went to the press and got some of the most vicious editorials published.

On December 3, 1987, 16 of the parcels were sold to private bidders at Cook County&#x27;s annual scavenger sale, and Langer and partnerships Langer controlled bought 13 of the parcels. On December 9, 1987, at the first regular business meeting of the City Council after the death of Mayor Washington in office, Washington foes brought the proposal out of committee. Alderman Bernard Stone joined Alderman Osterman in blocking the agreement, saying Shiller&#x27;s &quot;arrogance prevailed and that arrogance has to be answered on this floor.&quot; The Council rejected the consent decree 29–17.

=== Second term (1991–1995) ===

In 1991, Shiller supported Danny K. Davis in Davis&#x27; unsuccessful primary challenge to Daley. Daley endorsed Shiller&#x27;s challenger, Michael Quigley, campaigned with Quigley and sent letters in support of Quigley. Shiller finished seven votes ahead of Quigley, but a third candidate got 3.4% of the vote, which forced a runoff, the third straight run-off for Shiller and the fourth straight for the 46th ward. In the run-off, Shiller won with 53% of the vote, amid charges that Quigley was a carpetbagger.

Shiller added a budget amendment to triple the city&#x27;s AIDS budget in 1992. Shiller was one of nine alderman voting against Daley&#x27;s 1993 budget, which included a $28.7 million property tax increase. Shiller was absent for the 1994 budget vote, and was one of four aldermen dissenting on Daley&#x27;s 1995 budget.

=== Third term (1995–1999) ===

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was among newspapers that endorsed Shiller for re-election in 1995, and she won with 57% of the vote, without a run-off. Shiller supported U.S. Representative Bobby Rush in his unsuccessful challenge to Daley in 1999.

&quot;Arguably, the single most important legislative responsibility that aldermen have is voting on the city budget each year,&quot; Shiller said. She was the lone dissenting vote on Daley&#x27;s 1996, 1997 and 1998 budgets. During hearings on Daley&#x27;s 1996 budget, which included a $19.5 million property-tax increase, she submitted 123 questions on the budget in writing to department heads, but only 35 were answered. She objected to the tax increase in a period of several years of budget surpluses. She attended every hearing on Daley&#x27;s 1997 budget armed with policy questions that she said went unanswered. She was often the only alderman present at budget hearings.

=== Fourth term (1999–2003) ===

In 1999, Sandra Reed, a black high school English teacher, and two other women opposed Shiller, the first all-female field in an aldermanic race in Chicago history. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; again endorsed Shiller. Shiller prevailed with 55% of the vote in a runoff. Shiller was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community in 2000.

On November 17, 1999, Shiller joined in unanimous support for Daley&#x27;s 2000 budget, her first affirmative vote on a Daley budget and only her second affirmative vote on a City budget. Aldermen applauded. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley&#x27;s 2001, 2002, and 2003 budgets. In the 2001 redistricting of Chicago wards, Daley tried to deprive Shiller of her most committed supporters, but failed when none of the aldermen in adjacent wards wanted to contend with Shiller&#x27;s supporters. Shiller and Daley, however, reached an understanding: the mayor supported her in the 2003 elections and also pushed forward development of Wilson Yard, a Chicago Transit Authority facility destroyed by fire, into affordable housing and a Target store, using the Wilson Yard Tax Increment Financing District and the $26.5 million it generated. Subsequently, Shiller consistently voted in support of the mayor&#x27;s agenda.

=== Fifth term (2003-2007) ===

Shiller and Daley supported each other for re-election in 2003. Shiller cited Daley&#x27;s commitment to affordable housing, and in particular his Planning Department&#x27;s work on the Wilson Yard project. Columnist Mark Brown wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;,

The last squeaky wheel in the City Council had been greased. The last independent voice had joined the chorus ... Shiller&#x27;s endorsement of Daley is all the more amazing when you look at where she started, about as close to a Marxist as you&#x27;d ever find at City Hall.

Shiller defeated Reed again in 2003, this time with 58% of the vote. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley&#x27;s 2004 budget. Shiller was the only alderman who did not cast a vote on the passage of the Big Box Ordinance, which required large retailers to pay a living wage. Target sent a letter to Mayor Daley and alderman indicating that if the ordinance were not overturned, they would not proceed on projects in Chicago. Shiller voted to sustain Daley&#x27;s veto.

=== Sixth term (2007–2011) ===

Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 election largely focused on the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council&#x27;s Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in addressing crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, according to a report in &quot;Chicago Magazine&quot;.

Mayor Daley was among supporters of the Wilson Yard redevelopment project celebrating the completion of construction on July 20, 2010. The project included 98 units of subsidized housing for low-income residents in two buildings, one for seniors, and another for other families. The Target store opened on Sunday, July 22, 2010. On August 2, 2010, Shiller announced she would not run for re-election in 2011. Shiller reflected,

... we should be able to make sure that everyone has a place in the city, and when we do development ... we should make sure that the people who are here today will be here when that is complete ... my most singular perspective was to prove that that is possible. ... we have to have a city that is not just inclusive about our diversity but is serious and honest about making sure that everyone has a place here ...

On closing her ward office, Shiller wrote:

I am most proud of my achievements in tripling the City&#x27;s funding budget for HIV/AIDS victims and for developing the toughest stance on Apartheid that was ever written in the 90&#x27;s, for my work on domestic violence issues and establishing 24-hour daycare for children, the Ruth Shriman House for senior living, the Wilson Yards Development and for welcoming Target as a neighbor and partner, and of course setting the bar for affordable housing in Chicago.

==Retirement and the Westside Justice Center==
Shiller retired from politics in 2010 after her sixth term as alderman. In 2014, her son Brendan, a defense attorney, found a few empty buildings on Chicago&#x27;s west side and laid out a vision to his mother that included setting up shop for his law firm, Shiller and Preyar. Shiller used her years of experience in government work and community advocacy to create the Westside Justice Center which officially opened in 2015. By 2017, the Westside Justice Center became home to two law firms, several sole practitioners, three non-profits, and a cafe. The main non-profit, also called the Westside Justice Center helps to connect low-income communities to social services with the help of the center&#x27;s legal team. 

==Personal life==

Shiller separated from her husband Mark Zalkin, one of Mayor Harold Washington&#x27;s assistant press secretaries, and with Shiller a leader of the 46th Ward Community Service Center (later the Uptown Community Service Center) and an editor of &quot;Keep Strong&quot; magazine, and with Shiller and Coleman an editor of &quot;All-Chicago City News&quot;. Zalkin died on February 23, 1998, at age 49 due to complications from multiple sclerosis.

Shiller and Zalkin have one son, Brendan Shiller. Brendan attended Joseph Stockton Elementary School, a Chicago Public School, and Whitney Young Magnet High School, a selective-enrollment public magnet high school in Chicago&#x27;s Near West Side. While attending Truman College, Brendan was managing editor of &quot;All-Chicago City News&quot;. After Truman, Brendan went to Howard University in Washington, D.C. For two years starting in February, 1997 Brendan edited &quot;StreetWise&quot;, a street newspaper sold by people without homes or those at-risk for homelessness in Chicago. In 2003, Brendan graduated first in his class from John Marshall Law School and currently works as a lawyer representing criminal defendants and police misconduct plaintiffs.
One of Shiller&#x27;s granddaughters is the published poet Britteney Black Rose Kapri. Shiller is now a professional poker player.

Helen Shiller and her long-time staff member Maggie Marystone were interviewed in separate chapters in &quot;Hope Dies Last&quot;, a collection of oral histories by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Uptown resident Studs Terkel.

<doc id="1265518" wikidata="Q7146815" url="?curid=1265518" title="Patrick J. O'Connor">
<text>Patrick J. O&#x27;Connor (born June 21, 1955) is a former Chicago politician. He is the former alderman in Chicago&#x27;s City Council representing the 40th ward on the North Side of the city. He was first elected in 1983 at age 28, and was re-elected eight times before losing to Andre Vasquez in 2019. O&#x27;Connor was an unsuccessful candidate in the Democratic Party primary election for Illinois&#x27;s 5th congressional district special election, 2009.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Connor is the son of a Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Streets and Sanitation, Bureau of Equipment Services, under Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.

O&#x27;Connor graduated from Loyola University of Chicago School of Law in 1979. Fresh from law school, O&#x27;Connor successfully sued the city for back pay for his father after Mayor Jane Byrne fired him.

==Chicago City Council (1983–2019)==
O&#x27;Connor was first elected alderman for the 40th ward in 1983. He was subsequently reelected eight times, in 1987, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015. In 2019, he was denied a tenth term on the City Council, being unseated by challenger Andre Vasquez.

===Council Wars===
During the tenure of Mayor Harold Washington, who was black, O&#x27;Connor, who is white, caucused with the mostly-white opposition block in City Council known as the &quot;Vrdolyak 29&quot;. O&#x27;Connor chaired the City Council&#x27;s Committee on Education as a freshman alderman.

===Investigations and controversies===
In his first term, a federal grand jury investigated O&#x27;Connor for providing, in late 1983 and again in late 1984, year-end jobs on the Education Committee staff for fifteen persons, including his mother-in-law, his brother-in-law, his sister-in-law, wives of two former members of his law firm, and the wife of a former staff aide. Some of those hired admitted they did not realize they were on the City payroll. &quot;All in the Family&quot; was a popular name for O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s hiring practices, and O&#x27;Connor became known as the &quot;City Hall Santa&quot;. O&#x27;Connor compared his hiring practices to those of Britain&#x27;s royal family. When asked at a City Hall news conference if the practice amounted to nepotism, O&#x27;Connor said: &quot;Absolutely. I think nepotism is a system that has been around a long time. It has worked very well in England. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been much more of a problem here.&quot;

In 2008, O&#x27;Connor was found to be one of seven Chicago aldermen who between them got ten of their children good-paying summer jobs with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.

In May 2013, O&#x27;Connor suggested that the Catholic Church and other religious institutions and not for profit organizations should pay property taxes and be billed for water provided by the City of Chicago. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s comments were in support of a plan by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to charge such organizations for water which had traditionally been provided without charge to not for profit organizations. “The silliest things can be said and people latch onto it.” O’Connor said. “For Chrissake, we sell everybody water! And now all of a sudden because we’re a church, we’re not supposed to sell them water? At some point, i think what’s gonna happen is someone’s gonna say how about looking at property taxes? We’ll give ya free water. How about paying for the property you own.” O&#x27;Connor further suggested that the Catholic Church should not criticize the plan to bill it for water use, but ought to address its clerical abuse scandals.

O&#x27;Connor is married to Barbara O&#x27;Connor, a real estate broker. In the last decade Barbara has built a successful business selling houses and condos, many of which could not have been built without zoning changes enacted by the city council. Barbara sold more than $22 million worth of houses and condos in the 40th ward after the projects were enabled by Alderman O&#x27;Connor.

==Unsuccessful campaigns for other offices==
In 1990, O&#x27;Connor was defeated by Cecil Partee in a four-way race for the Democratic nomination for Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney in the Democratic primary on March 20, 1990, with Partee garnering 49% of the vote to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 37.5%.

O&#x27;Connor was defeated in his challenge to Republican incumbent Jack O&#x27;Malley in a campaign for Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney in the general election of November 3, 1992, with O&#x27;Malley garnering 62% of the vote to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 38%. O&#x27;Connor lost to O&#x27;Malley in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s own ward, 8,516 to 9,363.

On Tuesday, March 3, 2009, O&#x27;Connor finished fifth in a 12-way race in the primary election for the Democratic Party nomination for the United States House of Representatives in the special election called to replace US Rep. Rahm Emanuel in Illinois&#x27;s 5th congressional district.

<text>Andris Piebalgs (born 17 September 1957) is a Latvian politician and diplomat who served as European Commissioner for Development at the European Commission from 2010 until 2014. Between 2004 and 2009 he served as Commissioner for Energy. Between 4 June 2016 and 19 August 2017, he served as the leader of the Unity party.

==Career==
Andris Piebalgs was born on 17 September 1957 in Valmiera, Latvia. Piebalgs is a graduate in Physics from the University of Latvia. Andris Piebalgs is an experienced Latvian politician who occupied key positions in both national and European political fields. Earlier in his career, while Latvia was still part of the Soviet Union, Andris Piebalgs worked as a teacher and was the headmaster of the 1st Secondary School of Valmiera (1980–1990). He also served as director of the department in the Ministry of Education in Latvia. He was a member of Communist Party of Soviet Union from 1979.

In 1988, Latvian People&#x27;s Front, an organisation that united more than 200,000 people, was established. Supporters of Latvian self-determination gained victory in the March 1990 parliamentary election. It was the first time since the Soviet occupation that candidates from various political parties were allowed to take part. On 7 May 1990, Andris Piebalgs was appointed as Minister of Education in the new Government, and one year later, in August 1991, Latvia regained full independence. Andris Piebalgs&#x27; main task was then to put in place the first independent education system in Latvia.

In 1993, Andris Piebalgs won a seat in the Latvian Parliament, when the first elections after the restoration of independence were held according to the Latvian election law. He served as the chairman of the budget and finance committee until 1994. In September 1994, he became Latvia&#x27;s Minister of Finance and deputy prime minister.

From 1995 until 2003, he worked in the Latvian Diplomatic service. Andris Piebalgs first served as the ambassador of Latvia in Estonia (1995–1997), where he helped to solve the sea border issue between the two states. In 1997 he became the Latvian Ambassador to the EU. In this capacity he helped to establish Latvia as the EU candidate country and led the accession negotiations, which resulted in Latvia&#x27;s successful accession to the EU in 2004.

From 2003 to 2004, he was appointed Deputy Secretary of State for EU affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia. His role was instrumental in coordinating Latvia&#x27;s position in the European Council and all Council formations. At the time, he also established the new development assistance policy for Latvia.

In addition to his native Latvian he is fluent in English, German, French, and Russian, and has basic knowledge of Estonian.

==European Commission==
During the first Barroso Commission, starting in November 2004, he was the European Commissioner for Energy. In that capacity, he led the development of a more competitive, sustainable and secure European energy system, which is one of the crowning achievements of the Barroso I Commission. In doing so, he was instrumental in propelling EU energy issues into the centre of EU policy-making. In recognition of his leadership in European energy policy, The Economist magazine honoured him with the title &quot;Eurocrat of the Year&quot; in 2007. In 2009, Andris Piebalgs received the &quot;Diamond Prize&quot; from the Regional Chamber of Commerce in Katowice (Poland) for his work in developing a cohesive European Energy Policy for the further generations. In 2009, the Energy Efficiency Global Forum presented him the Energy Efficiency Visionary Awards for his &quot;outstanding contributions to the advancement of energy efficiency&quot;.

He was twice appointed Acting Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget in Janusz Lewandowski&#x27;s stead, from 19 April 2014 – 25 May 2014 while he was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 elections to the European Parliament and from 1 July 2014 – 16 July 2014 after he took up his seat.

===Selection hearing===
;Energy

On 15 November 2004 when questioned by the European Parliament as the Commissioner Designate for Energy, Piebalgs stressed the importance of environmental considerations in energy policy, and announced his intention to pursue a policy framework based on limiting growth in demand for energy while increasing diversity of supply.

He was cautious on the question of support for nuclear energy, and said that he favoured an EU-wide regulatory framework for nuclear safety as a way of increasing the industry&#x27;s transparency and levels of public acceptance. He also said that, &quot;strict application of provisions of the Euratom Treaty is essential.&quot;

Piebalgs expressed his unhappiness there was not yet a &#x27;level playing field&#x27; for competition in the energy and gas industries across the union. He assigned high priority to reducing overall energy demand, especially by improving the energy efficiency of buildings, promoting the long-term development of hydrogen as a fuel source, improving the competitiveness of renewable energy sources through economic measures, and supporting the development of nuclear fusion and the ITER project.

Following his hearing Piebalgs received strong backing from across the political spectrum, including the Greens, who had previously described László Kovács&#x27;s performance on energy issues as &quot;an offense to the parliament&quot;.

;Development

Hearing of the Commissioner Designate for Development took place on 11 January 2010 in the European Parliament. During three hours members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from Committees of Development, Foreign Affairs and International Trade questioned him about his political priorities and key aims of development policy. Commissioner Designate stressed that his main priorities in the office will be to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), ensure that EU Members States honour their commitments in regard to the Official Development Assistance (ODA) and to make our international aid more efficient.

Piebalgs underlined the need to take advantage of the creation of the post of a foreign policy High Representative and External Action Service, without, however &quot;allowing development policy to be seen in any way as simply a tool to achieve wider political goals for the EU&quot;. He also stressed the need &quot;to maintain the EU&#x27;s role as a champion of the developing world.&quot;

==Other activities==
From 2012 to 2013, Piebalgs served – alongside Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, David Cameron and others – on the High-level Panel on Post-2015 Development Agenda, an advisory board established by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to develop the global development agenda beyond 2015, the target date for the Millennium Development Goals.
In addition, Piegbals has held various honorary positions, including: 
* Friends of Europe, member of the board of trustees
* Friends of the Global Fund, member of the board

==Personal life==
Andris Piebalgs is married and has three children. During his free time he likes to play tennis and to go skiing.

<text>&quot;Bryan, Bryan, Bryan, Bryan&quot; is a lyric poem by American poet Vachel Lindsay. Written in August 1919, the poem recounts the dramatic rise and fall of U.S. presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan during the 1896 presidential campaign. The work was first published in &quot;The Sun&quot;, a New York City newspaper, and later included in Lindsay&#x27;s 1920 collection &quot;The Golden Whales of California And Other Rhymes in the American Language&quot;. The poem focuses upon the initial flowering of hope and later widespread despair among Bryan&#x27;s ardent supporters throughout the electoral vicissitudes of the campaign. 

== Summary ==

The poem chronicles William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s 1896 presidential campaign as seen through the eyes of an idealistic sixteen-year-old boy who strongly supports the Democratic Party candidate. While attending a Springfield, Illinois rally with his best girl, the young lovers hear the famous Cross of Gold speech recited by Bryan, a former United States Representative from Nebraska.

In the speech, Bryan supports bimetallism or &quot;free silver&quot;, which he argues will bring the nation prosperity, and he decries the gold standard, proclaiming that &quot;you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold&quot;. Bryan&#x27;s oft-recited speech becomes one of the most famous political addresses in American history and garners the young boy&#x27;s undying loyalty.

The boy&#x27;s spirits are later crushed by Bryan&#x27;s defeat via political intrigue at the hands of the Republican Party. The poem depicts the election outcome as an ignominious victory of large financial institutions and East Coast elites such as John Pierpont Morgan over the poorer regions and interest groups depicted as friendly toward Bryan such as the American Midwest and farmers.

The poem lists and comments upon many of the key political figures of the 1896 election, including the retiring presidential incumbent Grover Cleveland, the winning candidate William McKinley, and McKinley&#x27;s innovative campaign manager Mark Hanna. The poem also references contemporary 1890s cultural archetypes such as the Gibson Girl.

<text>The Israel Football Association (IFA; , &quot;HaHit&#x27;aḥdut leKaduregel beIsrael&quot;, ) is the governing body of football in Israel. It organizes a variety of association football leagues where the highest level is the Israeli Premier League; as well as national cups such as the Israel State Cup, the Toto Cup, and the Israel Super Cup; also, the Israel national football team. The IFA was founded in 1948 as the Palestine (&quot;Eretz Israel&quot;) Football Association and is based in the Tel Aviv District city of Ramat Gan, Israel. The Association is controversial due to its inclusion of clubs playing in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

==History==
The Palestine Football Association (PFA) or Eretz Israel Football Association, was founded in a meeting held on 14 August 1928, and applied for membership of FIFA. It was admitted provisionally on 17 December 1928, affiliated on 17 May 1929 and recognised by FIFA&#x27;s government on 6 July 1929. The PFA changed its name to the Israel Football Association (IFA) following the founding of the state of Israel in 1948.

The IFA was a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) from 1954 until 1974, when it was expelled due to political pressure from Arab and Muslim members that refused to play against Israel. From then until 1992, the IFA was not affiliated with any confederation. During this period, the Israeli national teams played only in FIFA competitions and occasionally in OFC (Oceania), UEFA (Europe), and CONMEBOL (South America) qualifying tournaments.

In 1992, the IFA was admitted to UEFA as an associate member, becoming a full member two years later. Since 1992, Israeli clubs have played in the various UEFA club competitions, while the national teams have played in UEFA championships.

==Controversy==
As of 2017, the IFA included six member clubs playing in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. These are Maccabi Ariel indoor football club and Ariel municipal football club in Ariel; Beitar Givat Ze’ev Shabi in Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev, a settlement near Ramallah; Beitar Ma’aleh Adomim in Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, a settlement near East Jerusalem; Hapo’el Oranit in Oranit; and Hapo’el Jordan Valley in Tomer, a settlement built on land seized from the Palestinian village of Fasayil. A seventh club, Hapo’el Katamon Yerushalayim, plays some home games in the settlement of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim while two other clubs playing in Israel list offices in settlements near Hebron and Ramallah. Sari Bashi, Israel and Palestine advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argues that the IFA is in violation of FIFA rules forbidding a club of one national association from playing in the territory of another as the West Bank is covered by the Palestinian Football Association, a FIFA member. Bashi also notes that Palestinians are not allowed to enter settlements to watch games played by these clubs.

German sportswear company Adidas previously sponsored the IFA, leading to criticism for supporting settlement clubs. More than 130 Palestinian sports clubs signed an open letter calling for Adidas to end its sponsorship of the IFA. An online petition of the BDS Movement to &quot;Tell Adidas to end sponsorship of Israeli settlement teams&quot; reportedly received more than 16,000 signatures. In June 2018, a Dutch BDS group delivered the open letter and petition to an Adidas office in Amsterdam. In July 2018, Adidas ended its sponsorship deal but was replaced as sponsor by Puma, another German sportswear company. As a result, Puma has become a BDS target with critics arguing that Puma, the IFA&#x27;s only international sponsor, &quot;is involved in violations of international law and human rights.&quot; Aya Khattab, a player on the Palestinian National Women&#x27;s football team, argued that &quot;Puma&#x27;s sponsorship of the IFA, and the international legitimacy that it grants, signal to Israel&#x27;s racist far-right regime that its expansion of illegal settlements by pushing Palestinian families off their ancestral lands can continue with impunity.&quot; Mahmoud Sarsak, a Palestinian football player who was imprisoned by Israel for several years without charge or trial, accused Puma of &quot;supporting the hate which is destroying lives and poisoning the beautiful game&quot; of football. In addition to Khattab and Sarsak, more than 200 Palestinian athletes and sports clubs have called for a Puma boycott, according to an article in Mondoweiss. In October 2019, posters calling for a boycott of Puma appeared on trains in London. The posters were removed by Transport for London, which described them as an unauthorized act of vandalism. In 2020, Universiti Teknologi MARA, the largest university in Malaysia, ended a sponsorship deal with Puma for their football team due to Puma&#x27;s IFA sponsorship.

During the 74th FIFA Congress on 17 May 2024 in Bangkok, the Palestinian Football Association called for a vote on suspending the IFA from both UEFA and FIFA, stating that the damage to football infrastructure and deaths of Palestinian footballers during the Israel–Hamas war were enough grounds to justify the action, while other supporters referred to other suspensions such as those of Apartheid South Africa from 1961 to 1991 and Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The IFA responded stating that their football was halted and that many of their footballers have been killed since 7 October 2023 while calling for peace and a future friendly between the two countries. Gianni Infantino would respond to the PFA stating that FIFA would conduct its own legal review and that the information about a final decision would be forwarded to the FIFA Council meeting on 3 October 2024 while also calling for peace. It was later decided that while Israel would not be suspended, FIFA would investigate the claims by the PFA.

StandWithUs, a Israel advocacy group in the US, criticized calls for a boycott stating that &quot;Sports are supposed to unite and bring people together, BDS drives them apart.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==
In 1979, Yosef Yekutieli, the founder of the IFA, was awarded the Israel Prize &quot;for dedicating his life to promoting and laying the international foundation of Israeli sports.&quot;

<doc id="1265531" wikidata="Q649329" url="?curid=1265531" title="Ennerdale Water">
<text>Ennerdale Water is the most westerly lake in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. It is a glacial lake, with a maximum depth of , and is wide and long.

The lake lies in the eponymous valley of Ennerdale, surrounded by some of the highest and best-known fells in Cumbria including: Great Gable (899 m), Green Gable, Brandreth, High Crag, Steeple and Pillar.
To the west of the lake lies the hamlet of Ennerdale Bridge, consisting of two pubs and a few houses. It is close to the port of Whitehaven.

==Etymology==
&quot; &#x27;Anund&#x27;s valley&#x27;. The name Ennerdale seems originally to have derived from &#x27;Anundar&#x27;, genitive sing.[ular] of the ON personal name &#x27;Anundr&#x27;/&#x27;Ǫnundr&#x27;, and ON &#x27;dalr&#x27; &#x27;valley&#x27;, but there has been cross-influence between this p.n. and &#x27;Ehen&#x27;, the name of the river which flows through the valley.&quot; (ON is Old Norse.)

The lake has been referred to in guidebooks and maps variously as &quot;Brodewater&quot; (1576), &quot;Brodwater&quot; (1695), &quot;Broad Water&quot; (1760), &quot;Ennerdale Water&quot; (1784) and &quot;Ennerdale Lake&quot; in Otley&#x27;s Guide (1823). It is now the Ordnance Survey convention to name it &quot;Ennerdale Water&quot;.

== Geography ==
Ennerdale Water is fed by the River Liza and other streams, and in turn feeds the River Ehen, which runs to the Irish Sea.

===Water abstraction===
Although the lake is natural, in 1902 a shallow weir was added to what is probably a glacial moraine to maintain the level. The lake is owned by United Utilities, which abstracts water to serve customers in the Whitehaven area.

In 2013, United Utilities was informed by the Environment Agency that the abstraction licence was being revoked to protect the environment of Ennerdale and the River Ehen. This meant that United Utilities had to find an alternative water source for customers in West Cumbria. After public consultation, a preferred option to provide water to West Cumbria via a new pipeline from Thirlmere was selected. After a public inquiry in 2014, the independent Planning Inspectors report ruled that the Thirlmere transfer was the right solution and that abstraction from Ennerdale Water would cease by 2022. The construction of the pipeline commenced in 2017. At the same time, United Utilities started to blend water from Ennerdale Water with groundwater from boreholes near Egremont.

== Environmental protection measures ==
Ennerdale has been designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Species of interest include the Arctic char. The site contains a variety of habitats apart from the open water of the lake itself.

== Tourism ==
Despite being sited on Wainwright&#x27;s coast-to-coast walk, the valley is not much visited by tourists.

Due to the remote location, the lack of a public road up the valley, and its management by the Forestry Commission, the National Trust and United Utilities, Ennerdale Water has not been as spoiled as other lakes in the National Park by construction, activity on the lake or the effects of tourism.

==Notable facts==
Though the Lake District is a popular UK location for film shoots, Ennerdale has been left relatively in the shadow, with only a few brief exceptions. The closing sequences of the film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002), directed by Danny Boyle, were filmed around the Ennerdale area, and include a sweeping, panoramic view of the lake.

In 1810 a large carnivore killed hundreds of sheep in and around Ennerdale before it was hunted down and killed. The locals dubbed it the Girt (&quot;dialect&quot;: &quot;great&quot;) Dog of Ennerdale, though it was said to have had the traits of both a dog and a large cat.

Once a year, during the last week in August, the Ennerdale Show brings local people together with agricultural displays, competitions, arts and crafts.

Former US President Bill Clinton first proposed to his wife Hillary on the banks of Ennerdale Water in 1973.

He survived a nasty confirmation battle and served as a University of California Regent from 1982 to 1987. He was instrumental in the appointment of one of the first openly gay judges in California, Rand Schrader. At Andelson&#x27;s urging, California Governor Jerry Brown appointed Schrader to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1980. Andelson was also a fund-raiser for Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Walter F. Mondale.

The Andelson Collection at the University of California, Santa Barbara Library is named in his honor. Located in the Ethnic and Gender Studies Library, the Collection supports the teaching curriculum and research interests of faculty and students in gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and studies across the disciplines.

On December 29, 1987, aged 56, Andelson died of complications related to AIDS.

Glick is a lifelong resident of New York City and has lived in Greenwich Village for over 40 years. A graduate of the City University of New York&#x27;s Queens College, she received a Master of Business Administration degree from Fordham University. Glick owned and managed a small printing business in TriBeCa before becoming deputy director of general services at the New York City Department of Housing, Preservation, and Development, where she worked until May 1990.

Glick&#x27;s political activism began in college, and she is still strongly involved in grassroots organizing. Glick first ran for the State Assembly in 1990 and won, becoming the first openly gay state legislator in New York State She has served in the legislature for 30 years, championing a number of progressive legislative causes as well as key local issues. She is Jewish.

== Legislative record ==

Glick serves as the Chair of the Assembly&#x27;s Higher Education Committee, which oversees all private and public higher education institutions, financial assistance for students, and professional licensing, a position she has held since 2007. Additionally, Glick serves on the Ways and Means, Rules, Governmental Operations, and Environmental Conservation Committees. She also serves as the Chair of the Assembly&#x27;s Intern Program, overseeing the Assembly&#x27;s student interns.

As an Assembly member, her legislative priorities have focused on women&#x27;s rights, including expanding access to reproductive healthcare; LGBTQ rights; environmental preservation and protection; the protection of animals, especially those in shelters; higher education; tenants&#x27; rights; increasing pedestrian and traffic safety; maintaining and expanding open space; and support for the arts.

Glick is a member of the Vote Blue Coalition, a progressive group and federal PAC created to support Democrats in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania through voter outreach and mobilization efforts.

=== LGBTQ and women&#x27;s rights ===

Glick&#x27;s legislative victories include the passage of the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act (SONDA), which was finally signed into law in December 2002. Glick&#x27;s Hospital Visitation Bill became law in 2004, providing domestic partners the same rights that spouses and next-of-kin have when caring for a loved one in a hospital or nursing facility.

She has worked on issues of concern to women for over thirty years, including advocating for reproductive freedom, a change in the rape statutes, and women&#x27;s health concerns. The Women&#x27;s Health and Wellness Act, a bill that promotes early detection and prevention of certain medical conditions affecting women, including breast cancer and osteoporosis, and provides coverage for contraceptives, became law on January 1, 2003. Glick was the lead sponsor of the Reproductive Health Act, to codify and expand protections granted in Roe v. Wade in New York State, which was signed into law in January 2019.

Deborah Glick supported the legalization of gestational surrogacy in the State of New York with some minor adjustments and changes to the bill to protect the surrogate and the parties involved in regards to monetary compensation.
The bill was first introduced in the New York State Assembly in 2012 by Amy Paulin. Governor Andrew Cuomo signed it into law in 2021, effectively repealing the ban on the medical procedure with monetary compensation for the pregnant women involved. Glick believes in family planning methods and stated on Twitter in October 2021 that there is a problem called overpopulation of people on the planet, causing damage to the Earth.

=== Protection of animals ===

Glick is an animal lover and has sponsored and helped pass a number of bills to improve animal welfare. These include the Veterinary Emergency Response and Mobility Act, which allows out-of-state veterinarians and veterinary technicians to provide assistance in New York during declared disasters and high-volume animal cruelty investigations; an act to prohibit the importation, possession, sale, or release of Eurasian boars in New York State; and a law prohibiting the online shooting of animals or targets. She has also fought for increased funding for animal shelters and was twice successful in allocating a $5 million capital matching grant to humane societies across the state.

=== Higher education ===

In her role as Chair of the Higher Education Committee, Glick has championed the SUNY and CUNY systems and the rights of students. Among her legislative achievements, Glick was the primary sponsor of the Student Lending Accountability, Transparency, and Enforcement Act, which established protections for students and parents to protect them from exploitative student loans and became law in 2007. She also sponsored and championed legislation to implement the Enough is Enough Program, which requires New York State higher education institutions to adopt a state-wide uniform definition of affirmative consent and a number of policies protecting the rights of sexual assault victims and those who report assaults. Glick has also been an ardent supporter of the rights of student workers, such as graduate teaching and research assistants, to collectively bargain through establishing trade unions or labor organizations.

=== Tenant&#x27;s rights and arts support ===

During her tenure, Glick has been a strong advocate for tenants&#x27; rights and has sponsored and won renewal of the Loft Law. This law brings formerly commercial buildings up to residential code and protects current tenants, many of them artists, from eviction. This law became permanent in 2010. Deborah has always been a strong proponent of the arts and has consistently advocated for increases in funding state-wide because of her conviction that the arts play a crucial role in the economic and cultural life of New York City and New York State. Currently, she is the sponsor of several measures to protect the rights of tenants, as well as legislation to provide a tax credit to renters.

=== Pedestrian and traffic safety ===

Glick has been a champion for pedestrian safety. She was the lead Assembly sponsor of a bill establishing a pilot program to install speed cameras in school zones in 2013, which studies show has demonstrably reduced dangerous driving in those zones. Glick has championed legislation to expand that program, which has been blocked by the New York State Senate; however, after the pilot program expired in 2018, it was renewed and expanded by the New York City Council.

Glick was also the primary sponsor of bills allowing cities to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour, requiring motorists to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks uncontrolled by traffic signals, and requiring those under 16 to use seat belts when riding in the backseat.

=== Parks and open space ===

Glick has long fought against efforts to privatize open space in her district and has been a strong proponent of maintaining and increasing park space in her district and in New York City. Glick was active in the fight against developing the Westside piers into Hudson River Park, and since the park&#x27;s creation, he has fought at the state and city level for adequate funding for the park&#x27;s maintenance and against efforts to privatize parts of the park.

Glick has also been involved in grassroots community activism to preserve open space, including the preservation of the Elizabeth Street Garden. She was the lead sponsor on a bill that aided in the creation of the Stonewall National Monument, the first national monument honoring the history of the LGBT rights movement.

=== Disability rights ===

Glick was the lead sponsor of legislation requiring the MTA to make 100 key stations fully accessible. While the MTA has not completed this work, Glick has advocated for its completion and for expanding accessibility to additional stations.
==Election Victories==
On Tuesday, September 14, 2016, Deborah Glick defeated Jim Fourratt in the Democratic Party primary. She won 3151 out of the 3928 votes cast. Jim received 777 votes.

<doc id="1265542" wikidata="Q1259442" url="?curid=1265542" title="Driza-Bone">
<text>Driza-Bone, originating from the phrase &quot;dry as a bone&quot;, is a trade name for the company making full-length waterproof riding coats and apparel. The company was established in 1898 and is currently Australian owned and manufactures its products in Australia. The trademark of Driza-Bone was first registered in 1933.

This style of coat originated in Australia workwear for stockmen. Not traditionally considered desk-wear, the coats were developed to protect horse riders from the rain and feature straps that hold the coat to the rider&#x27;s leg.

==History==
In the late 1800s, a Scot named Edward Le Roy emigrated to New Zealand. He was able to manufacture oilskin rainwear for use by sailors on sailing ships in the local waters at the time. The garments were originally constructed from the lightweight sails of the sailing ships. The waterproofing of the clothing was by application of linseed oil to the cotton. T. E. Pearson, the son of E. J. Pearson who started Pearson Soap in Hamilton, New Zealand, took a consignment of Leroy Coats to Australia. Stockmen at the time had gathered news of this garment from sailors who had subsequently left sailing to work on the land. Because the garments were flammable around campfires, T. E. Pearson worked on developing a new formula for sealing the coats. He did this in the backyard shed of his home in Kangaroo Street, Manly. Pearson subsequently, in partnership with Leroy, registered the trademark. T.E. died in 1964 and is buried in Frenchs Forest, New South Wales.

Over time, changes were made to the original design in the order of:
#longer coat for horse riding
#fantail in the back of the coat to cover the saddle
#wrist straps to secure the sleeves and stop the arms from getting cold
#leg straps to stop the coat from flapping around

As time went by, the linseed oil (while proving satisfactory for waterproofing) went hard and cracked in the hot summers. Le Roy and T.E. Pearson (of Pearson&#x27;s Sandsoap fame) came up with a new proofing technique. This new proofing technique has remained unchanged to the present day.

In late 2008, the brand was brought back into Australian ownership for the first time in many decades. The acquisition brought with it several influential industry figures, including Steve Bennett (founder of Country Road). This resulted in the immediate relocation of both the Eagleby, Queensland, head office and primary warehousing facilities to Melbourne, Victoria.

In December 2023, Driza-Bone was purchased by S. Kidman &amp; Co. 

==Major appearances==
===2000 Olympic Games===
Driza-Bone riding coats were worn by the stockmen and stockwomen at the Opening Ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Also, the 2000 Olympic Band members wore Driza-Bone coats specially made for them as band musicians, in which the sleeves were made completely differently from the sleeves of the traditional Driza-Bone riding coats worn by the riders. The red, white and blue colours of the Driza-Bone coats for the band members were also different from the usual colour of the Driza-Bone coats. Also, all the medal presenters during the 2000 Summer Olympic Games wore Driza-Bone coats.

===Stage musical===
Driza-Bone coats were also worn by the cast members of the 2002 theatre musical &quot;The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular&quot;. These were designed by the bush/rural clothing enthusiast and designer, Robert Peron, who is a major figure in attempting to have the Driza-Bone accepted as a true fashion item far beyond its status as an Australian icon — Driza-Bones not having entered the fashion lexicon as yet.

===APEC Australia 2007===
 Driza-Bone coats made an appearance at the 2007 APEC Summit in Sydney. The 21 leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference posed in a group photo wearing Driza-Bone attire. According to an official statement, Australian Prime Minister John Howard selected Driza-Bone as the national outfit &quot;with counsel and good advice&quot; from his wife, Janette, and the APEC taskforce.

===&quot;Tales from Margaritaville&quot;===
The Driza-bone duster, or stockman&#x27;s coat is mentioned by name by the Tully Mars, the hero of the short story &quot;Take Another Road&quot; from the short story collection &quot;Tales from Margaritaville&quot;, by Jimmy Buffett.

<text>Jacqueline Barbara Goldberg (born November 18, 1944) is an American former politician, activist and educator who served as a member of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education for District 5 from 2019 until 2024. Previously serving as a board member from 1983 until 1991, Goldberg has also served as a member of the Los Angeles City Council and the California State Assembly.

Participating in the Free Speech Movement while a student at the University of California, Berkeley, Goldberg was first elected to the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education in 1983. In 1993, she was elected to the Los Angeles City Council for the 13th district, becoming the first openly lesbian candidate elected to the city council. Goldberg was later elected to the California State Assembly for the 45th district. After a period away from electoral politics, she was re-elected to the Board of Education in 2019.

While serving on the City Council, Goldberg spearheaded efforts to extend benefits to unmarried domestic partners and authored a significant ordinance that ensured a living wage and benefits for all City of Los Angeles employees. She was also credited by the business community with being instrumental in revitalizing Hollywood. In the State Assembly, she authored several education-related bills and passed legislation that granted LGBT couples rights similar to those of married spouses.

== Early life and education ==
Goldberg was born on November 18, 1944 in Los Angeles, California, to Ed Goldberg, a housewares salesman, and Ruth Goldberg, a teacher. She has a brother, Arthur, who is an activist and attorney. The family lived in Inglewood, California, where she attended Morningside High School. She graduated early and attended University of California, Berkeley, where she graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. She later went to the University of Chicago, where she graduated with a master&#x27;s degree.

While in high school, she became involved in activism. In 1964, she and Arthur became participated in the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. Goldberg took a leading role and led the initial talks with the University of California administration to peacefully resolve the police car blockade before being replaced as the spokesperson by Mario Savio. She was arrested during a nonviolent demonstration, which subsequently prevented her from securing a job within the Los Angeles Unified School District. After graduating from the University of Chicago, she became a teacher in the Compton Unified School District.

== LAUSD Board of Education ==
In 1983, Goldberg ran for the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education against 3rd district incumbent Tony Trias, who had been appointed three years earlier. Goldberg placed ahead of Trias in the primary election. In the general election, Goldberg defeated Trias, with her victory contributing to a four-person liberal majority on the board, alongside the simultaneous election of Larry Gonzalez. In the 1987 election, Trias again challenged Goldberg, but she defeated him again in the primary.

During her first tenure as school president, the board implemented a year-round schedule to alleviate overcrowding in schools and established a program to give greater authority to the community, including teachers and parents. However, Goldberg expressed disappointment that many low income, immigrant, and minority students continued to struggle academically. She faced criticism for her straightforwardness and was viewed as untrustworthy by some, particularly conservative board members. Her supporters argued that the criticism stemmed from her initiatives to reform the system and empower parents and teachers. During the 1989 teachers&#x27; strike, Goldberg was one of three board members inclined to compromise with the teachers&#x27; union, and she attempted to reach an agreement before the strike occurred. Two months later, Goldberg was elected as board president. However, board member Rita Walters cast the lone vote against Goldberg&#x27;s election, expressing concern that Goldberg&#x27;s election was from the board&#x27;s preference for teachers over administrators. She was later re-elected to the position on July 9, 1990. In November 1990, Goldberg announced her retirement from the board and her intention to return to her career as a high school teacher. She was succeeded by teacher Jeff Horton.
On July 23, 2018, following the resignation of incumbent District 5 board member Ref Rodriguez due to perjury and other felony charges, Goldberg expressed interest in filling his seat. She clarified that she intended to serve only the remainder of his term if appointed but expressed the possibility of running in a special election if she were not appointed. Some parents wanted a Latino representative since the majority of the students were Latino, but Goldberg highlighted her endorsements from Latino leaders such as Dolores Huerta. The board opted to schedule an election on March 5, 2019, followed by a runoff on May 14, 2019, while also deciding against pursuing an appointment process. Goldberg announced her candidacy to complete the term as a candidate backed by the teachers&#x27; union. Among ten candidates, she secured the top position and proceeded to a runoff against Heather Repenning. In the runoff, Goldberg achieved a landslide victory over Repenning, signaling a significant shift in the board&#x27;s power dynamic toward union-backed members, as the board had previously been majority pro-charter. In the 2020 election, she was challenged by teacher Christina Martinez Duran. Goldberg faced opposition from Manhattan Beach businessman Bill Bloomfield, who ran attack ads against her. The advertisements accused Goldberg of putting children at risk of gun violence and linked her to a sexual misconduct scandal at Miramonte Elementary, which Goldberg denounced as &quot;vicious lies.&quot; Despite Bloomfield&#x27;s efforts, Goldberg defeated Martinez Duran and was re-elected to a second term.

In her first days back on the board, Goldberg challenged the aid provided to charter schools and pushed for the passing of Measure EE, a school funding measure. In July 2020, following the George Floyd protests, Goldberg co-wrote a resolution with board member Mónica García to reduce the school police budget by $25 million. In January 2023, Goldberg was elected as the president of the Board of Education, replacing Kelly Gonez. In her second tenure as president, she focused on making meetings understandable and accessible to the public, explaining how the board conducted its business, and ensuring that meetings and public comments started on time. She also led the board in providing LGBTQ+ support following anti-LGBTQ+ protests at Saticoy Elementary School. Prior to the three-day teachers&#x27; strike in 2023, Goldberg led talks between the teachers&#x27; union and the district. These negotiations broke down after union organizers accused the district of breaking confidentiality. Goldberg admitted to this, explaining that she wanted to congratulate the organizers and was unaware it was supposed to be a secret. She was re-elected as board president on December 12, 2023. In August 2023, Goldberg announced that she would be retiring from the board in 2024 and stepping away from electoral politics. She was succeeded by Karla Griego in the 2024 election.

== Los Angeles City Council ==

In 1993, Goldberg entered the race for the Los Angeles City Council&#x27;s 13th district seat after incumbent Michael Woo opted not to seek re-election, instead making an unsuccessful mayoral bid. Joining Goldberg in the election were notable figures from the gay community, including AIDS health care executive Michael Weinstein and television executive Conrado Terrazas. Future councilmember Tom LaBonge, who was serving as an aide to council president John Ferraro at the time, also ran in the election. She and LaBonge advanced to a runoff, with Goldberg receiving endorsements from high-profile Democrats like Gloria Molina and aiming to perform well in ethnically diverse urban areas. LaBonge concentrated his campaign efforts on districts outside Hollywood, targeting conservative, Anglo-American homeowners. Both traded accusations of holding to special interests, with LaBonge accusing Goldberg of taking special-interest money, and Goldberg claiming LaBonge accepted campaign funds from real estate developers. In the subsequent runoff election, Goldberg defeated LaBonge, becoming the first openly lesbian candidate to win a seat on the City Council.

While in the City Council, Goldberg introduced a motion to extend health insurance coverage to unmarried domestic partners of city employees. The decision drew criticism for its timing, given the city&#x27;s ongoing budget deficit. However, it was also praised for enabling more people to get coverage, with proponents arguing that the costs would be minimal. Goldberg led the revitalization of the Hollywood area after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, in which she and her staff helped the Federal Disaster Assistance with giving supplies. She also assisted in forming the Yucca Corridor Coalition, which helped renovate the crime-ridden area, and developed a successful slum abatement program that held landlords accountable. In 1995, she and her wife, Sharon Stricker, co-founded an after-school enrichment initiative for students.

After her 2000 election to the State Assembly, Goldberg resigned from her seat on the City Council. She advocated for the appointment of her chief of staff, Sharon Delugach, to fill the vacancy, but the council ultimately decided against an appointment. The election to succeed her saw a variety of candidates, including her brother, Arthur, former councilmember Woo, former candidate and Goldberg&#x27;s staffer Terrazas, activist Bennett Kayser, assemblyman Scott Wildman, and Eric Garcetti, the son of Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti. Garcetti and Woo advanced to a runoff, where Garcetti ultimately won the election.

== California State Assembly ==

In 1999, Goldberg entered the 2000 election for the California State Assembly to succeed Antonio Villaraigosa, who was termed out and running for Mayor of Los Angeles in 2001. Initially facing competition from AIDS activist Cesar Portillo and legal services director Antonio de la Rosa, the latter withdrew from the race, leaving Goldberg and Portillo as the remaining candidates. During the campaign, Portillo accused Goldberg&#x27;s campaign of spreading rumors about his arrest nine years earlier by an undercover policeman in a whispering campaign, and publicly disclosed this information to address the allegations. However, Goldberg&#x27;s campaign denied these claims. In the primary, Goldberg secured a landslide victory over Portillo, and subsequently proceeded to win the general election unopposed. She was re-elected in 2002 and 2004 before being termed out. She was a founding member of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus in June 2002 alongside Mark Leno, Sheila Kuehl, John Laird, and Christine Kehoe.

While in the Assembly, Goldberg served as the chair of the Committee on Education and authored several education-related bills. These efforts included legislation to expedite school construction, a bill that gave teachers more say in textbook selection and curriculum development, and an attempt to ban Native American mascots in schools, which was ultimately blocked. She also wrote a bill that eliminated some of the differences between domestic partnerships and traditional marriages. The bill gave same-sex couples financial obligations to each other and to any children, responsibility for each others&#x27; debts, and the ability to own property and file taxes jointly. After she termed out, she was succeeded by labor organizer Kevin de León, who defeated Christine Chavez, the granddaughter of Cesar Chavez, and Elena Popp, the candidate endorsed by Goldberg.

== Personal life ==
Goldberg is lesbian and Jewish, and is married to Sharon Stricker, a poet and activist. The couple met in 1976 and moved to Echo Park three years later. They were married on March 8, 2004, in San Francisco during the city&#x27;s same-sex weddings. Goldberg and Stricker have an adopted son named Brian Stricker Goldberg, whom they raised together.

After first retiring from politics in 2006, Goldberg taught for several years as part of the UCLA Teacher Education Program and joined UCLA&#x27;s Center X. When Roy Romer was nearing retirement as Superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, Goldberg was rumored to be campaigning for an appointment to the office, although she denied having any interest in the position.

<doc id="1265546" wikidata="Q1044298" url="?curid=1265546" title="Carole Migden">
<text>Carole Migden (born August 14, 1948, in New York City) is an American politician from San Francisco who represented the third district of the California State Senate from 2004 to 2008 and the 13th district of the California State Assembly from 1996 to 2002. She is the state&#x27;s second openly lesbian legislator.

Migden&#x27;s former district, the 3rd Senate district, includes parts of San Francisco, Sonoma County, and Marin County. She was previously a member of the California State Assembly (1996–2002), where she became the first freshman, first woman, and first lesbian to chair the Committee on Appropriations. She was also Chairwoman of the California Board of Equalization (2002–2004), the nation&#x27;s only publicly elected tax commission. Prior to that, she had served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (1991–1996). She also chaired the San Francisco Democratic Party for eight years and is a former member of the Democratic National Committee.

Migden was the Chairperson of California Senate Labor &amp; Industrial Relations Committee and the Chairperson of the Senate Majority Caucus. She was previously the Senate Appropriations Committee Chair. She was, at the time, the only openly lesbian state legislator from Northern California.

In 2009, Migden was appointed State Commissioner of the California Integrated Waste Management Board (2009-2010), promoting green technology and a zero-based waste policy. In 2011, Appointed Commissioner of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board (2011-2012), set up to protects the legal rights of agricultural workers.

==State legislature==
In the State Assembly, Migden served for five years as Chairwoman of the Assembly Committee on Appropriations. She was the first woman and the first lesbian to chair that committee. She also served for four years as a conferee on the state&#x27;s Joint Budget Conference Committee, which writes the final version of California&#x27;s state budget. As a member of the State Assembly, Migden authored legislation to create California&#x27;s domestic partner registry, promote children&#x27;s health, preserve the old growth Headwaters Forest, increase accountability in K–12 schools, protect borrowers from predatory and deceptive lending practices, protect consumers from manipulation by energy generators, and promote the use of emergency contraception.

In 1998, Migden authored the &#x27;‘Safe Needles Act&#x27;’ (AB1208 - 1998) that became a national model for legislation that President Clinton signed into law in 2000. Prior to this bill being passed, needles injured 100,000 health care workers a year.

Migden authored the &#x27;‘Clean Water Act&#x27;’ in 1999 that imposed tougher penalties on industrial polluters dumping harmful toxins in California waterways. She also authored the Headwaters Forest and SF Wetlands/Cargill legislation that enabled the state preservation of the ancient Headwaters Forest and restoration of the San Francisco Baylands into a wildlife habitat and recovery of endangered species.

Over the last seven years Migden has authored legislation for domestic partnership in California providing benefits to the LGBT community and unmarried senior citizens. Assembly Bill 26 in 1999 marked the first time in the nation a state legislature passed a domestic partnership statute without forcible intervention of the courts. (Assembly Bill 26).

Migden&#x27;s SB 565 provided for the legalization of the transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes (Senate Bill 565) and provided for the filing of domestic partner income-tax returns under the same status as married couples. (Senate Bill 1827).

In 2005, Migden&#x27;s SB 663 closed tax loopholes allowing corporate giants to put millions in offshore tax shelters and depleting the state of revenues. Migden has authored legislation to improve foster care that created new programs such as transitional housing, increased savings accounts, and adoption incentives for parents adopting teenagers.

Migden has authored legislation providing for rapid HIV testing (AB 1263), protection of health care workers from needle injuries (AB 1046) and enabling of HIV positive people to have healthy children (SB 443).

In 2002 Migden authored legislation (AB 1860) requiring the state to provide information regarding the &quot;morning after&quot; contraception to female victims of sexual assault.

Staunchly opposed to the war in Iraq, Migden became one of the first critics of the war and passed a Senate resolution making California the first state in the nation to formally oppose the surge of troops in Iraq.

==Marin==

In the fall of 2007 Migden helped resolve a five-year- standoff between Marin County and the state of California regarding property taxes taken by the State and diverted to fund education deficits. With rising property tax values, the state decided to withhold an additional $4 million of county generated tax revenues to pay for programs for troubled children throughout California. Marin officials claimed the state was forcing the county to shoulder an unfair degree of state oriented funding. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed two bills pushed forward by Migden to resolve the issue. Migden&#x27;s third bill passed and resulted in cutting the amount of surplus funds the county will annually pay to the state by half. The bill resulted in an extra $1.9 million a year for Marin County and a total return of $24.7 million to the area.

== Personal life ==

Migden was born August 14, 1948, in New York City. Migden is Jewish. Migden has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Adelphi University and a Master of Arts degree from Sonoma State University.

=== Marriage ===
In February 2004, she married Cristina Arguedas, a criminal defense attorney and her partner since 1985, in a ceremony at San Francisco City Hall officiated by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. That marriage was later annulled by the California Supreme Court.

===Leukemia===
On May 23, 2007, Migden announced that she was diagnosed with leukemia in 1997 (about a year into her first Assembly term). She was only expected to live 3–5 years after her diagnosis.

Migden underwent rigorous and difficult chemotherapies for two years before finally becoming a participant in clinical trial, which ultimately got FDA approval for Gleevec, which has proven to be a watershed cancer drug. She has been in complete remission for many years.

Migden&#x27;s legislative activity persisted, uninterrupted, during the time she was undergoing treatment, continuing to enact legislation including the Clean Water Act, the first Domestic Partnership bill, HMO Health Care Reform, and many others.

=== Driving history===

In 1996, Migden ran a stop sign by the State Capitol and crashed into a 1990 Dodge Spirit sedan owned by Teresa Latham. The crash injured Latham and destroyed Latham&#x27;s car. Latham claimed that Migden did not &quot;seem concerned at all about the situation.&quot; Migden accepted full responsibility for the accident and refutes the claim that she was not concerned about Latham or her car.

On May 18, 2007, Migden crashed her SUV into a sedan which was stopped at a red light, injuring Ellen Butawan and her 3-year-old daughter, who were sent to the emergency room. Migden claims that she may have suffered from an adverse response to her leukemia treatment that led her to drive erratically. 911 tapes released in August show other drivers who saw her during her 30-mile trip along I-80 were panicking as they reported seeing her hit the center divider, and repeatedly come close to hitting other cars, before finally hitting one. One motorist claimed Migden told her, &quot;You can&#x27;t talk to me like that. I&#x27;m a senator.&quot; Migden voluntarily ceased driving as she continued to undergo treatment and as medical tests were pursued. Migden claimed that her &quot;wild ride&quot; occurred during state business, so that the Department of General Services paid $335,000 to Butawan in July 2009.

In May 2007, Migden said &quot;I owe an explanation to the public and myself and, in particular, the person I hurt.&quot;

On August 10, 2007, Migden entered a &quot;nolo contendere&quot; (no contest) plea to charges of reckless driving, paid a $710 fine and was sentenced to two years of probation.

==Awards==

In 1998 Migden was named &quot;Rookie of the year&quot; award by the &quot;California Journal&quot;, giving her top honors in the categories of integrity, intelligence, hardest working and most influential. In 1999, Migden received &quot;Legislator of the Year&quot; honors from the California School Employees Association. and the National Center for Lesbian Rights&#x27; &quot;Lesbian Leadership Award&quot;. In 2000, she was recognized with the &quot;Affordable Housing Leadership Award&quot;. In 2001, Migden was named &quot;Legislator of the Year&quot; by the California National Organization for Women.

==Election 2008==
Seeking a second term in the state senate, Migden failed to win renomination in the 2008 primary election held on 2008-06-03. She finished second in a three-way race. Assemblyman Mark Leno won the nomination, while Migden finished slightly ahead of former Assemblyman Joe Nation from El Verano. She was the first legislator to lose a renomination since Assemblyman Brian Setencich lost his primary race in 1996. The election was won by Democrat Mark Leno.

The race was one of the costliest legislative races in the state. Migden came into the race with $647,000 in the bank from past races, but according to the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), she did not properly transfer campaign funds. The FPPC investigators found 89 violations in campaign finance reporting. The FPPC originally prevented her from using the $647,000 from previous races. On March 6, Migden filed a legal challenge against the FPPC, claiming the FPPC ruling had violated her right to free speech. The FPPC settled the dispute with Migden for a record $350,000 fine. Richie Ross, Migden&#x27;s campaign consultant, called the issues in the complaint legitimate, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s no excuse, and she will have to take her legitimate lumps. I know it, and she knows it.&quot;

Democratic delegates at the state party convention in March 2008 voted not to endorse Migden 742–298.

<doc id="1265560" wikidata="Q27898" url="?curid=1265560" title="Aimaq dialect">
<text>Aimaq or Aimaqi () is the dominant eastern Persian ethnolect spoken by the Aimaq people in central northwest Afghanistan (west of the Hazarajat) and eastern Iran. It is close to the Dari varieties of Persian. The Aimaq people are thought to have a 5–15% literacy rate.

== Dialects ==
Subdialects of Aimaq dialect include:

* Changezi
* Firozkohi
* Jamshidi
* Maliki
* Mizmast
* Taimani
* Timuri
* Zainal
* Zohri (also known as Zuri)

==Phonology==
Phonetically, as one of the eastern Persian dialects, the Aimaq dialect resembles a formal or classical form of Persian.

Vowels:

* The &quot;majhul&quot; vowels &quot;ē&quot; / &quot;ī&quot; and &quot;ō&quot; / &quot;ū&quot; are still kept separate, whereas in western Persian they are merged as &quot;ī&quot; and &quot;ū&quot; respectively. For instance, the identically written words شیر &#x27;lion&#x27; and &#x27;milk&#x27; are in western Persian both pronounced [šīr], but in Aimaq [šēr] for &#x27;lion&#x27; and [šīr] for &#x27;milk&#x27;. The long vowel in زود &#x27;quick&#x27; and زور &#x27;strong&#x27; is realized as [ū] in western Persian, in contrast, these words are pronounced as [zūd] and [zōr] respectively by Aimaq speakers.
* The diphthongs of early Classical Persian &quot;aw&quot; (as &quot;ow&quot; in Engl. &quot;cow&quot;) and &quot;ay&quot; (as &quot;i&quot; in English &quot;ice&quot;) have in Aimaq become (as in Engl. &quot;low&quot;) and (as in Engl. &quot;day&quot;). Dari, on the other hand, is more archaic, e.g. نوروز &#x27;Persian New Year&#x27; is realized as in Iranian, and in Aimaq, and نخیر &#x27;no&#x27; is uttered as in Iranian, and as in Aimaq.
* The high short vowels [i] and [u] tend to be lowered in western Persian to [e] and [o].
* and are in Aimaq kept separate in word-final positions, unlike western Persian, where has as a word-final allophone.

Consonants:

* Aimaq still retains the (classical) bilabial pronunciation of the labial consonant و, which is realized as a voiced labiodental fricative in western Persian. is found in Aimaq as an allophone of &quot;f&quot; before voiced consonants.
* The voiced uvular stop (ق) and voiced velar fricative (غ) are still kept separate in Aimaq. They have coincided in western Persian (probably under the influence of Turkic languages like Azeri and Turkmen).

<doc id="1265563" wikidata="Q28213" url="?curid=1265563" title="Alyutor language">
<text>Alyutor or Alutor is a language of Russia that belongs to the Chukotkan branch of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages, by the Alyutors. It is moribund, as only 25 speakers were reported in the 2010 Russian census.

==Sociolinguistic situation ==
The Alutor are the indigenous inhabitants of the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula. The language is unwritten and moribund; in the 1970s residents of the chief Alutor village of Vyvenka under the age of 25 did not know the language. In recent years the Vyvenka village school has started teaching the language. Until 1958 the language was considered the &quot;village&quot; (settled) dialect of the Koryak language, but it is not intelligible with traditionally nomadic varieties of Koryak. The autonym means &quot;villager&quot;.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Alyutor has six vowels, five of which may be long or short. The schwa cannot be long.

=== Consonants ===
There are 18 consonants in Alyutor.

=== Stress ===
Stress generally falls on the second syllable of polysyllabic words, and on the first syllable of disyllabic words, e.g.:
* &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;skin&#x27;, &#x27;to feed&#x27;, &#x27;husband&#x27;, &#x27;mukluk&#x27;.

An open syllable containing schwa cannot be stressed. As a consequence, if a disyllabic term begins with such a syllable, the stress is shifted to the last syllable and thereafter a new, epenthetic syllable is added at the end, e.g.:

** -&gt; &#x27;mosquito&#x27;.

The final syllable of a word is never stressed.

=== Syllable structure ===
All Alyutor syllables begin with a single consonant. If the vowel is short, including a schwa, they may also close with a single consonant. Consonant clusters are not permitted in the word initial or word final positions. The schwa is used to break up disallowed clusters.

Examples are &#x27;to work&#x27;, &#x27;eagle&#x27;, &#x27;parka&#x27;.

Alyutor word boundaries always coincide with syllable boundaries.

==Orthography==

The Alyutor language does not have an official orthography, but the newspaper &quot;Aborigen Kamchatki&quot; uses the following orthography:
== Typology ==
Alutor is a polysynthetic language.

The morphology is agglutinative, with extensive prefixes and suffixes.

The argument structure is ergative.

The word order is variable, and it is difficult to say which typology is basic. The verb-absolutive orders AVO and VAO are perhaps most common.

== Morphology ==
Alyutor has the following parts of speech: nouns, adjectives, numerals, pronouns, verbs, participles, adverbs, postpositions, conjunctions, and particles.

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are inflected for number, case, definiteness, and grammatical person.

There are three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural.

There are eleven cases: absolutive, ergative, locative, dative, lative, prolative, contractive, causative, equative, comitative, and associative.

Number and case are expressed using a single affix. A suffix is used for all cases except the comitative and associative, which are expressed using circumfixes. There are two declensions, taught as three noun classes. The first class are nonhuman nouns of the first declension. Number is only distinguished in the absolutive case, though verbal agreement may distinguish number when these nouns are in the ergative. The second class are proper names and kin terms for elders. They are second declension, and distinguish number in the ergative, locative, and lative cases, as well as the absolutive. The third class are the other human nouns; they may be either first or second declension.

==== Case roles ====
*The absolutive case is the citation form of a noun. It is used for the argument (&quot;subject&quot;) of an intransitive clause and the object of a transitive clause, for &quot;syntactic possessives&quot;, and for the vocative.
*The ergative is used for the agent (&quot;subject&quot;) of a transitive verb, as an instrumental case, and as the argument of an antipassive clause.
*The locative is used for position and direction (essive and lative cases), as well as arguments which are &quot;driven away&quot;, e.g.:

*The dative is used for recipients, benefactors, directional objects (allative case), and subjects of experiential verbs
*Lative is used for motion toward a goal
*Prolative is used for movement along and movement from (perlative and elative cases)
* Equative is used with the meanings &#x27;like X&#x27;, &#x27;as X&#x27;, usually with verbs like &#x27;to become&#x27;, &#x27;to turn into&#x27;, &#x27;to work as,&#x27; etc.
* Contactive is used for objects that make contact
* Causative is used for noun phrases that cause or motivate an action
* Comitative is used for ... . It is primarily used with high-animacy referents.
* Associative is used for secondary or passive accompaniment. It is only attested in the declension of nouns of the first declension, usually inanimate.

==== Grammatical person ====
Grammatical first and second person suffixes on nouns are used to equate a noun with participants in the discourse. They only appear in the absolutive, with an intervening &quot;j&quot; on nouns ending in a vowel and an &quot;i&quot; on nouns ending in a consonant.

* ...ʡopta am-ʡujamtawilʔ-ə-muru &quot;yes we the people&quot;
* japlə=q ʡujamtawilʔ-iɣəm &quot;and I&#x27;m a man&quot;

=== Numerals ===
Alyutor has simple numerals for the numbers one to five, ten, and twenty. All other numbers are compounds based on these numerals.

===Verbs===
There are finite (conjugated) and non-finite verbs. There are several conjugations.

====Polypersonal conjugation====
Finite verbs agree in person and number with their nuclear arguments; agreement is through both prefixes and suffixes. Transitive verbs agree with both arguments (ergative and absolutive), whereas intransitive verbs agree with their sole (absolutive) argument.

Verbs distinguish two aspects, perfective, the bare stem, and imperfective, using the suffix &quot;-tkə / -tkəni&quot;. There are five moods, indicative, imperative, optative, potential (marked by the circumfix &quot;ta…(ŋ)&quot;), and conjunctive (prefix &quot;ʔ-/a-&quot;).

==== Monopersonal conjugation ====
Monopersonal verbs include two conjugations, one with the third-person singular in &quot;ɣa-...-lin,&quot; and the other in &quot;n-...-qin&quot;.

==== Impersonal conjugation ====
For impersonal forms of conjugation include verbal predicate (formed with the circumfix a...ka) and imperative (formed by circumfix ɣa...a/ta). Non-finite forms Impersonal forms include the verbal predicate with the circumfix &quot;a…ka,&quot; and the imperative in &quot;ɣa…a/ta.&quot;

==== Non-finite forms ====
These include the infinitive, supine, gerunds, and participles.

<text>Arcana Studio is a Canadian animation studio in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Founded as a comic book publisher by former Coquitlam, British Columbia school teacher; Sean O&#x27;Reilly in 2004, it opened an animation division in 2012.

==Overview==

Arcana is Canada&#x27;s largest publisher of comics and graphic novels, with over 300 titles, spanning across a variety of genres, in its library. Arcana titles have been translated into different languages, including French, Italian, Greek, Spanish and Polish. It was formed in 2004 with the publication of the first issue of the comic book series &quot;Kade&quot;. The issue was written by O&#x27;Reilly and illustrated by artist Eduardo Garcia. With Diamond Comics as the distributor, Arcana&#x27;s first comic went on shelves December 31, 2003.

In 2005, Arcana was presented with the Joe Shuster Award for Outstanding Publisher of The Year based on sales during their first year, as voted by the retailers and readers. On April 13, 2005, &quot;Kade: Identity&quot; become the publisher&#x27;s first trade paperback book.

&quot;The Clockwork Girl&quot; #0 published with over 150,000 copies on December 5, 2007. It was written by Sean O’Reilly and Kevin Hanna, with Grant Bond as the drawing and coloring artist. A few months later, &quot;The Clockwork Girl&quot; won silver medal for The Moonbeam Award for Top Comic/Graphic Novel, as well as the Graphic Novel of the Year.

On October 1, 2009, Arcana bought The Devil&#x27;s Due library of graphic novels, acquiring characters such as Banzai Girl, Kore, and Blade of Kumori.

&quot;Mighty Mighty Monsters&quot; was published on September 1, 2010. It was later turned into three 44-minute animated specials. 

In 2012, Arcana opened an animation division to develop and produce its content for all platforms including film, television, direct-to-home and digital media. With the opening of its animation division, Arcana Studio released their first animated feature &quot;The Clockwork Girl&quot; in 2014, based on the graphic novel of the same name. On February 15, 2012, Arcana bought The Blue Water library of graphic novels, which included titles like &quot;10th Muse&quot;, &quot;Legend of Isis&quot;, &quot;Leprechaun&quot; and &quot;Blackbeard Legacy&quot;.

Arcana went on to produce &quot;&quot;, a 13 episode TV mini-series about a First Nations superhero which aired on APTN (Aboriginal Peoples Television Network) and made its debut in 2014. The studio&#x27;s continued success led to the development of its own intellectual properties like &quot;Pixies&quot; and the &quot;Howard Lovecraft&quot; trilogy. &quot;Pixies&quot; was Arcana&#x27;s first independently created feature involving well-known actors such as Academy Award winner Christopher Plummer, Alexa PenaVega and Bill Paxton. &quot;Pixies&quot; was written and directed by Sean O&#x27;Reilly, who was nominated at the 2016 Leo Awards for best Direction in an Animation Program for his work on the film.

In 2016, &quot;Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen Kingdom&quot; was released, the first in the three part series. It is based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft and the graphic novel created by Bruce Brown. The film features the voices of Christopher Plummer, Jane Curtin, Ron Perlman and Doug Bradley. The film won the Official Selection and the Best in Category Sci-Fi title at the 2016 Hot Springs International Horror Film Festival.

Its sequel, &quot;Howard Lovecraft and the Undersea Kingdom,&quot; was released in 2017.

<doc id="1265580" wikidata="Q29379" url="?curid=1265580" title="Askunu language">
<text>Ashkun (&quot;&quot;) is a Nuristani language spoken by the Ashkun people – also known as the Âṣkun, Âṣkuňu, Askina, Saňu, Sainu, Yeshkun, Wamas, or Grâmsaňâ – from the region of the central Pech Valley around Wâmâ and in some eastern tributary valleys of the upper Alingar River in Afghanistan&#x27;s Nuristan Province. Other major places where the language of Ashkun is spoken are Nuristan Province, Pech Valley in Wama District, eastern side of the Lower Alingar Valley in Nurgaram and Duab districts, Malil wa Mushfa, Titin, Kolatan and Bajagal valleys.

It is classified as a member of the Nuristani sub-family of the Indo-Iranian languages.

==Name==
The name &quot;Ashkun&quot; comes from &quot;Âṣkuňu&quot; in the local language. The alternative name &quot;Saňu&quot; in Ashkun, denoting a group of people living in Wâmâ, has cognates in other Nuristani languages, such as Kamviri &quot;Ćâňu&quot; , Katë &quot;Ćâvřu&quot; , and Prasun &quot;Zünyu&quot; .

==Demographics==
Current status: There are currently about 40,000 ethnic people who speak this language. None of the mentioned people are monolinguals. Illiteracy rate among this group of people is around 5%-15%.

Location: Upper-middle Pech Valley and over the watershed into the Bâźâigal, Mâsēgal, and Titin valleys of upper Laghmân.

Dialects/Varieties: Âṣkuňu-veri (Kolâtẫ, Titin, Bâźâigal), Gřâmsaňâ-vīri, Saňu-vīri (Wâmâî). Not intelligible with the other Nuristani languages.

==Dialects==
Ashkun can be split into several dialects spoken in southwestern Nuristan, including Âṣkuňu-veri (Kolâtẫ), Gřâmsaňâ-vīri, Saňu-vīri (Wâmâî), Titin, and Bâźâigal. The main body of the Âṣkuňu tribe inhabits the Aṣkũgal (Kolâtẫ, Mâsēgal) Valley, which drains southwestward into the Alingar River. These people speak a dialect which differs from that of their neighbors in the Titin Valley to the south (cf. Morgenstierne 1929). The inhabitants of the Bâźâigal Valley further up the Alingar are reported to speak a third dialect. Across a mountain ridge to the east of the Âṣkuňu two tribal groups, each with its own dialect, center on the villages of Wâmâ and Gřâmsaňâgřām (Ačaṇu) off the Pech River. For this article, most cited forms will be based on the Wâmâ dialect (Saňu-vīri).

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
*/ɽ/ can be heard as nasalized [ɽ̃] or as a nasal tap [ɳ̆], when within nasalized vowel positions, contrasting with a retroflex nasal [ɳ].
*/t͡ɕ, d͡ʑ/ can have fronted allophones of [t͡s, d͡z] in free variation.
*The tap [ɾ] is in complementary distribution with /ɽ/.
*Sounds [f, x, ɣ, q, ħ, ʕ, ʔ, h] also may occur, but they are not fully integrated in the sound system.

=== Vowels ===
* Vowels may also be nasalized as /ĩ, ẽ, ə̃, ã, õ, ũ/
* /ə, ə̃/ can have allophones of [ɨ, ɨ̃].

== Orthography ==
The Ashkun language is strictly passed on orally and has no written resources that can be traced.

<text>Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), also known as stomach stapling, is a form of bariatric surgery for weight control. The VBG procedure involves using a band and staples to create a small stomach pouch. In the bottom of the pouch is an approximate one-centimeter hole through which the pouch contents can flow into the remainder of the stomach and hence on to the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract.

Stomach stapling is a restrictive technique for managing obesity. The pouch limits the amount of food a patient can eat at one time and slows passage of the food. Stomach stapling is more effective when combined with a malabsorptive technique, in which part of the digestive tract is bypassed, reducing the absorption of calories and nutrients. Combined restrictive and malabsorptive techniques are called gastric bypass techniques, of which Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RGB) is the most common. In this technique, staples are used to form a pouch that is connected to the small intestine, bypassing the lower stomach, the duodenum, and the first portion of the jejunum.

This type of weight loss surgery is losing favor as more doctors begin using the adjustable gastric band. The newer adjustable band does not require cutting into the stomach and does not use any staple lines, thus making it a much safer alternative.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Advantages===
* No dumping syndrome.
* No nutritional deficiencies/malabsorption.

===Disadvantages===
* Needs strict patient compliance to diet.
* High-fiber foods and foods with a more dense, natural consistency can become very difficult to eat, while highly refined foods cause little discomfort. Many people who regain any weight lost after surgery do so because they begin to avoid the discomfort associated with consuming &quot;healthier&quot; foods, and start eating more easily passed &quot;junk&quot; foods.
* VBG is in no way a magic bullet or pill. It must be emphasized that lifestyle changes, e.g., diet and exercise, are absolutely imperative for weight loss to occur and be maintained. Realistic expectations are imperative.
* Reversal of a VBG requires a much more complex and intensive surgical process than getting the VBG. When removal of a polyurethane band is involved (polyurethane was predominantly used in the 1980s and 90s), it likely has built substantial scar tissue that must also be removed, depending on how long since the VBG took place. Removal of the staples involves stitching back together the previously separated parts of the stomach. For these reasons, a reversal should be considered only if there are serious medical complications.
* Vomiting and severe discomfort if food is not properly chewed or if food is eaten too quickly.
* Not adjustable (as with the adjustable gastric band, aka &quot;lap band&quot;)).

===Alternatives===
* Duodenal switch surgery
* Vertical sleeve gastrectomy
* Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
* Selective vagotomy (snipping the vagus nerve, effectively stopping hunger sensations).
* Mini gastric bypass

==Long term==
Although restrictive operations lead to weight loss in almost all patients, they are less successful than malabsorptive operations in achieving substantial, long-term weight loss. About 30% of those who undergo VBG achieve normal weight, and about 80% achieve some degree of weight loss. Most studies have suggested that 10 years after surgery, only 10% of patients maintain a minimum weight loss of at least 50% of their total excess weight at the time of their initial surgery. Some patients regain weight. Others are unable to adjust their eating habits and fail to lose the desired weight. Successful results depend on the patient&#x27;s willingness to adopt a long-term plan of healthy eating and regular physical activity. According to an episode of &quot;Oprah Winfrey&quot; that aired on October 24, 2006, 30% of people who undergo weight-loss surgery such as VBG or gastric bypass develop addiction transference, which is transferring the previous addiction to food with a new addiction to alcoholism. The show stressed the importance of examining the root causes of addiction in order to avoid the phenomenon.

==Complications==
* Staple-line disruption
* Stomal fibrosis
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease
* Incisional ventral hernia

==History==
Vertical banded gastroplasty was developed in 1980 by Dr. Edward E. Mason at the University of Iowa. Dr. Mason also developed the original gastric bypass for weight reduction in 1966 and is known for his pioneering work as the &quot;father of obesity surgery&quot;.

<doc id="1265583" wikidata="Q29579" url="?curid=1265583" title="Awadhi language">
<text>Awadhi, also known as Audhi, is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Awadh region of Uttar Pradesh in northern India and in Terai region of western Nepal. The name &quot;Awadh&quot; is connected to Ayodhya, the ancient city, which is regarded as the homeland of the Hindu deity Rama, the earthly avatar of Vishnu. Awadhi is also widely spoken by the diaspora of Indians descended from those who left as indentured laborers during the colonial era. Along with Braj, it was used widely as a literary vehicle before gradually merging and contributing to the development of standardized Hindi ( Khadi Boli ) in the 19th century. Though distinct from standard Hindi, it continues to be spoken today in its unique form in many districts of central Uttar Pradesh.

It is regarded by the Indian government to be a dialect of Hindi, and the area where Awadhi is spoken to be a part of the Hindi-language area owing to their cultural proximity, meanwhile Standard Hindi also serves as the lingua franca of the region. As a result, Hindi, rather than Awadhi, is used for school instruction as well as administrative and official purposes; and its literature falls within the scope of Hindi literature. Some of the most culturally significant works in Indian literature like the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; and &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot; have been written in Awadhi.

Alternative names of Awadhi include &quot;Baiswāri&quot; (after the subregion of Baiswara), as well as the sometimes ambiguous &quot;Pūrbī&quot;, literally meaning &quot;eastern&quot;, and &quot;Kōsalī&quot; (named after the ancient Kosala Kingdom).

==Geographic distribution==
=== In India ===
Awadhi is predominantly spoken in the Awadh region encompassing central Uttar Pradesh, along with the lower part of the Ganga-Yamuna doab. In the west, it is bounded by Western Hindi, specifically Kannauji and Bundeli, while in the east, Bhojpuri from the Bihari group of Eastern Indo-Aryan languages is spoken. In the north, it is bounded by the country of Nepal and in the south by Bagheli, which shares a great resemblance with Awadhi.

The following districts of North and Central UP speak Awadhi-
* Kanpur (along with Kannauji)
* Lakhimpur Kheri
* Sitapur
* Hardoi (along with Kannauji)
* Unnao
* Fatehpur
* Barabanki
* Lucknow
* Rae Bareli
* Amethi
* Bahraich
In eastern parts of UP the Awadhi language changes its form to a special dialect called &quot;Eastern Standard Awadhi.&quot; This region makes boundary with Bhojpuri speaking districts of Purvanchal. This part include districts of-
* Ayodhya
* Ambedkar Nagar
* Prayagraj
* Mirzapur (westernmost parts)
* Jaunpur (western parts)
* Bhadohi (western parts)
* Sultanpur(western parts)
* Pratapgarh
* Gonda
* Balrampur
* Basti (western parts)
* Siddharthnagar (western parts)
* Kaushambi

=== In Nepal ===
The Language Commission of Nepal has recommended Tharu and Awadhi as official language in Lumbini province. Awadhi is spoken in two provinces in Nepal:
* Lumbini Province
** Banke District
** Bardiya District
** Dang District
** Kapilvastu District
* Sudurpashchim Province
** Kailali District
** Kanchanpur District

=== Outside South Asia ===

A language influenced by Awadhi (as well as other languages) is also spoken as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for Indians in Fiji and is referred to as Fijian Hindi. According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, it is a type of Awadhi influenced by Bhojpuri and is also classified as Eastern-Hindi. Caribbean Hindustani spoken by Indians in Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana is based on Bhojpuri and partly on Awadhi. The Hindustani that is spoken in South Africa and the Bhojpuri spoken in Mauritius is also partly influenced by Awadhi.

== Classification ==
Awadhi is an Indo-European language and belongs to the Indo-Aryan sub-group of the Indo-Iranian language family. Within the Indo-Aryan dialect continuum, it falls under the East-Central zone of languages and is often recognised as Eastern-Hindi. It is generally believed that an older form of Ardhamagadhi, which agreed partly with Sauraseni and partly with Magadhi Prakrit, could be the basis of Awadhi.

The closest relative of Awadhi is the Bagheli language as genealogically both descend from the same &#x27;Half-Magadhi&#x27;. Most early Indian linguists regarded Bagheli merely as &#x27;the southern form of Awadhi&#x27;, but recent studies accept Bagheli as a separate dialect at par with Awadhi and not merely a sub-dialect of it.

==Literature==
=== Late-medieval and early-modern India ===
In this period, Awadhi became the vehicle for epic poetry in northern India. Its literature is mainly divided into: bhaktīkāvya (devotional poetry) and premākhyān (romantic tales).

====Bhaktīkāvyas====
The most important work, probably in any modern Indo-Aryan language, came from the poet-saint Tulsidas in the form of &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; (1575 C.E.) or &quot;The Lake of the Deeds of Rama&quot;, written in doha-chaupai metre. Its plot is mostly derivative, either from the original &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; by Valmiki or from the &quot;Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, both of which are in Sanskrit. Mahatma Gandhi had acclaimed the &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot; as &quot;the greatest book of all devotional literature&quot; while western observers have christened it as &quot;the Bible of Northern India&quot;. It is sometimes synonymously referred as &#x27;Tulsidas Ramayana&#x27; or simply &#x27;the Ramayana&#x27;.

Tulsidas&#x27;s compositions &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot;, &quot;Pārvatī Maṅgala&quot; and &quot;Jānakī Maṅgala&quot; are also written in Awadhi.


The first Hindi vernacular adaptation of the &#x27;Dasam Skandha&#x27; of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the &quot;Haricharit&quot; by Lalachdas, who hailed from Hastigram (present-day Hathgaon near Rae Bareilly), was concluded in 1530 C.E. It circulated widely for a long time and scores of manuscript copies of the text have been found as far as eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Malwa and Gujarat, all written in the Kaithi script.

&quot;Satyavatī&quot; (ca. 1501) of Ishvaradas (of Delhi) under the reign of Sikander Lodi and &quot;Avadhabilāsa&quot; (1700 C.E.) of Laladas were also written in Awadhi.

Awadhi appeared as a major component in the works of &quot;Bhakti&quot; saints like Kabir, who used a language often described as being a &quot;pancmel khicṛī&quot; or &quot;a hotch-potch&quot; of several vernaculars. The language of Kabir&#x27;s major work &quot;Bijak&quot; is primarily Awadhi.

====Premākhyāns====
Awadhi also emerged as the favourite literary language of the Eastern Sufis from the last quarter of the 14th century onwards. It became the language of &quot;premākhyāns&quot;, romantic tales built on the pattern of Persian &quot;masnavi&quot;, steeped in Sufi mysticism but set in a purely Indian background, with a large number of motifs directly borrowed from Indian lore. The first of such &quot;premākhyān&quot; in the Awadhi language was Candāyan (1379 C.E.) of Maulana Da&#x27;ud. The tradition was carried forward by Jayasi, whose masterpiece, the Padmāvat (1540 C.E.) was composed under the reign of the famous ruler Sher Shah Suri. The Padmavat travelled far and wide, from Arakan to the Deccan, and was eagerly copied and retold in Persian and other languages.

Other prominent works of Jayasi such as Kānhāvat, Akhrāvaṭ and Ākhrī Kalām are also written in Awadhi.

The Awadhi romance Mirigāvatī (ca.1503) or &quot;The Magic Doe&quot;, was written by Shaikh &#x27;Qutban&#x27; Suhravardi, who was an expert and storyteller attached to the court-in-exile of Sultan Hussain Shah Sharqi of Jaunpur. Another romance named Madhumālatī or &quot;Night Flowering Jasmine&quot; by poet Sayyid Manjhan Rajgiri was written in 1545 C.E.

Amir Khusrau (d. 1379 C.E) is also said to have written some compositions in Awadhi.

=== Modern India ===
The most significant contributions to the Awadhi literature in the modern period have come from writers like Ramai Kaka (1915–1982 C.E.), Balbhadra Prasad Dikshit better known as ‘Padhees’(1898–1943 C.E.) and Vanshidhar Shukla (1904–1980 C.E.). 

‘Krishnayan’ (1942 C.E.) is a major Awadhi epic-poem that Dwarka Prasad Mishra wrote in imprisonment during the Freedom Movement of India. In 2022 Dr. Vidya Vindu Singh has been awarded Padma Shri for her contribution in Awadhi literature.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
Awadhi possesses both voiced and voiceless vowels. The voiced vowels are: /ə/, /ʌ/, /aː/, /ɪ/, /iː/, /ʊ/, /uː/, /e/, /eː/, /o/, /oː/. The voiceless vowels, also described as &quot;whispered vowels&quot; are: /i̥/, /ʊ̥/, /e̥/.



==== Vowel combinations ====


=== Consonants ===
== Grammar ==

=== Comparative grammar ===
Awadhi has many features that separate it from the neighbouring Western Hindi and Bihari vernaculars. In Awadhi, nouns are generally both short and long, whereas Western Hindi has generally short while Bihari generally employs longer and long forms. The gender is rigorously maintained in Western Hindi, Awadhi is a little loose yet largely preserved, while Bihari is highly attenuated. Regarding postpositions, Awadhi is distinguished from Western Hindi by the absence of agentive postposition in the former, agreeing with Bihari dialects. The accusative-dative postposition in Awadhi is /kaː/ or /kə/ while Western Hindi has /koː/ or /kɔː/ and Bihari has /keː/. The locative postposition in both Bihari and Western Hindi is /mẽː/ while Awadhi has /maː/. The pronouns in Awadhi have /toːɾ-/, /moːɾ-/ as personal genitives while /teːɾ-/, /meːɾ-/ are used in Western Hindi. The oblique of /ɦəmaːɾ/ is /ɦəmɾeː/ in Awadhi while it is /ɦəmaːɾeː/ in Western Hindi and /ɦəmrən&#x27;kæ/ in Bihari.

Another defining characteristic of Awadhi is the affix /-ɪs/ as in /dɪɦɪs/, /maːɾɪs/ etc. The neighbouring Bhojpuri has the distinctive (i) /laː/ enclitic in present tense (ii) /-l/ in past tense (iii) dative postposition /-laː/ which separates it from the Awadhi language.

=== Pronouns ===

;Notes:

:indicates a form inflectable for gender and number :
:# mor → &quot;mōrā (masculine), mōrī (feminine), mōrē (plural)&quot;
:# hamār → &quot;hamrā (masc.), hamrī (fem.), hamrē (pl.)&quot;
:# tōr→ &quot;torā (masc.), torī (fem.), torē (pl.)&quot;
:# tumar→ &quot;tumrā (masc.), tumrī (fem.), tumrē (pl.)&quot;
:# tohār→ &quot;tohrā (masc.), tohrī (fem.), tohrē (pl.)&quot;

== Word formation ==

Following are the morphological processes of stem formation in the Awadhi language:

Affixation

An affix is used to alter the meaning or form of a word. It can be either a prefix or a suffix.
* Example: Prefix &quot;bē–&quot; preceding the root &quot;saram&quot; means &quot;shameless&quot; while &quot;apna&quot; followed by &quot;–pan&quot; means &quot;belonging-ness&quot;.

Compounding

Two or more stems are combined to form one stem.
* Example: &quot;nīlkanṭh&quot; means &quot;blue bird&quot; and &quot;banmānus&quot; means &quot;forest man&quot; or &quot;chimpanzee&quot;.

Reduplication

This process involves the repetition of certain forms. It may be complete, partial, or interrupted.

# Complete reduplication: It denotes continuity of action.
#* Example: &quot;jāt-jāt&quot; for &quot;going on&quot;.
# Partial reduplication: It denotes similarity of one object to other.
#* Example: &quot;hãpaṭ-dãpaṭ&quot; for &quot;panting&quot;.
# Interrupted reduplication: It stresses on the instant condition of the action that follows and expresses abundance of something.
#* Example: &quot;khētaī khēt&quot; &quot;between the fields&quot;; &quot;garmaī garam&quot; &quot;the very hot&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

=== Entertainment ===
The 1961 film &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; features Awadhi being spoken by the characters in a neutralised form. Gabbar Singh&#x27;s speech in the 1975 film &quot;Sholay&quot; was a mix of Khariboli and Awadhi, inspired by Dilip Kumar&#x27;s dacoit character Gunga from &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot;. In the 2001 film &quot;Lagaan&quot;, a neutralized form of Awadhi language was used to make it understandable to audiences. The 2009 film &quot;Dev.D&quot; features an Awadhi song, &quot;Paayaliya&quot;, composed by Amit Trivedi. In the television series &quot;Yudh&quot;, Amitabh Bachchan spoke parts of his dialogue in Awadhi, which received critical acclaim from the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;. Awadhi is also spoken by the residents of Ayodhya and other minor characters in Ramanand Sagar&#x27;s 1987 television series &quot;Ramayan&quot;. The lyrics of the song &quot;Rang Barse Bhige Chunar Wali&quot;, from the movie &quot;Silsila&quot; starring Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha, are in Awadhi dialect.

The Awadhi folk song &quot;Mere Angne Mein Tumhara Kya Kaam Hai&quot; has become popular in Bollywood with a neutralized version of it being in the 1981 film &quot;Laawaris&quot; starring Amitabh Bachchan, as well as being in the 1970 film &quot;Bombay Talkie&quot; and the 1975 film &quot;Maze Le Lo&quot;, it was also released as a single by Neha Kakkar in 2020. Another Awadhi folk song that became popular through Bollywood was &quot;Holi Khele Raghuveera&quot;, which was neutralized and sung by Amitabh Bachchan and put into the 2003 film &quot;Baghban&quot; starring Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini.

The 1982 movie Nadiya Ke Paar was in Awadhi (the 1994 remake by the same director, &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, was in Hindi.)

=== Folk ===
The genres of folklore sung in Awadh include Sariya, Byaah, Suhag, Gaari, Nakta, Banraa (Banna-Banni), Alha, Sawan, Jhula, Hori and Barahmasa.

== Sample phrases ==
The Awadhi language comes with its dialectal variations. For instance, in western regions, the auxiliary /hʌiː/ is used, while in central and eastern parts /ʌhʌiː/ is used.

The following examples were taken from Baburam Saxena&#x27;s &quot;Evolution of Awadhi&quot;, and alternative versions are also provided to show dialectal variations.

<text>Idlewild is a science fiction novel by American writer Nick Sagan, published in 2003. It is the first of a trilogy, with sequels &quot;Edenborn&quot; and &quot;Everfree&quot;. The story is split between two settings: the middle of the 21st century (told through interludes and distinguished from the main story by italics) and a generation later. It is a picture of the last ten people on earth, a near-complete pantheon of gods and goddesses.

==Plot==

The backstory is revealed in interludes throughout the book. In the middle of the 21st century, a retrovirus called &quot;Black Ep&quot; renders all of humanity infertile, and causes people to die. In the lab of a major German-American genetic research facility, a group of scientists are working on a project to save humanity by raising ten genetically altered children in immersive virtual reality. To test the efficiency of the software, one of the scientists, Halfway Jim, uses a program designed to be as close to a real child as possible, to run through the virtual lives the children will lead. Out of sentimentality, Jim&#x27;s dying act is to integrate this program, which he names Malachi, into the virtual reality environment.

The main story follows one of the virtual &quot;students,&quot; a young man named Halloween, who wakes up with total amnesia and must piece together what he can of the world around him. Halloween meets nine other students: Jasmine, Mercutio, Pandora, Simone, Isaac, Lazarus, Vashti, Tyler, Champagne, and Fantasia. Fan, Mercutio, Hal, and Tyler are known as the &quot;clods,&quot; who misbehave, while Simone, Isaac, Lazarus, Vashti, Champagne, and Pan are the &quot;pets,&quot; who study and follow all of the rules. The digital teacher of the school is named Maestro, but the clods call him Mae$tro (pronounced &#x27;Maeshtro&#x27;) and do not respect him. Each student is given a digital world that they may edit to their liking and a &quot;Nanny,&quot; a digital being that can help a student with anything they need help with.

Mercutio asks Halloween if he&#x27;d like some food, and they decide to dine at the Taj Mahal. Mercutio begins to order a steak, but halfway through his order, the entire world freezes up. Mercutio has triggered a so that he and Hal can escape the virtual world, and they both wake up in their beds in the school. They decide to visit their favorite diner, Twain&#x27;s, and enjoy a nice meal before Merc decides to head back to IVR. Halloween calls his parents and reports that he is dropping out.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote that while the book &quot;might seem a rather lumbering affair when laid out&quot;, it &quot;nips along quite nicely, deftly sidestepping the overly drawn-out or too-fraught-with-meaning scenarios one might expect from this apocalyptic masquerade.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Despite a compelling twist near the middle, the low tension and meandering plot will likely frustrate the primary target audience, mainstream fans of such futuristic action films as The Matrix and Minority Report.&quot; Ann Kim of &quot;Library Journal&quot; wrote that despite &quot;occasionally reading more like a drawn-out short story rather than a novel&quot;, the book is a &quot;fine debut by a writer with potential to grow&quot;.

Sally Estes of &quot;Booklist&quot; wrote that Sagan &quot;captures perfectly the voice and actions of a rebellious, extremely intelligent teenager.&quot; Gerald Jonas of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the book is &quot;long on visuals, short on narrative logic and, surprisingly, weak on science.&quot;

==Sequels==
A sequel, &quot;Edenborn&quot;, was published in 2004. A second sequel, &quot;Everfree&quot;, was published in May 2006.

<text>Jadranka Kosor (; born 1 July 1953) is a Croatian politician and former journalist who served as Prime Minister of Croatia from 2009 to 2011, having taken office following the sudden resignation of her predecessor Ivo Sanader. Kosor was the first and so far only woman to become Prime Minister of Croatia since independence.

Kosor started working as a journalist, following her graduation from the Zagreb Faculty of Law. During the Croatian War of Independence, she hosted a radio show dealing with refugee problems and disabled war veterans. She joined the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in 1989 and quickly climbed up the party hierarchy. In 1995 she was elected party vice-president and was elected to serve in Parliament for the first time. After the death of president and longtime HDZ leader Franjo Tuđman, Kosor supported Ivo Sanader&#x27;s successful party leadership bid in 2000. Three years later, her party won the parliamentary election and Kosor became the Minister of Family, Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Inter-generational Solidarity in the Sanader&#x27;s first and, later, Sanader&#x27;s second cabinet, during which time she served as deputy prime minister as well. In the 2005 presidential election she ran as a representative of the HDZ, but lost to incumbent president Stjepan Mesić in the second round. After the abrupt resignation of Sanader, Kosor managed to form a functioning parliamentary majority and was approved to her new post as prime minister in July 2009, also becoming leader of her party. Kosor was the party&#x27;s candidate for prime minister in the 2011 general election, but HDZ lost in a landslide over the centre-left Kukuriku coalition, led by the Social Democratic Party. Kosor handed power to the new prime minister, Zoran Milanović, in December 2011.

As prime minister, Kosor failed to commit to structural reforms although she managed to prevent the country&#x27;s budgetary meltdown with two budget revisions and the introduction of new taxes as a response to the ongoing economic crisis. During her tenure, she strongly advocated a zero-tolerance policy to political corruption and organized crime. This uncompromising stance, along with the new criminal code passed before her term began, opened the door to unprecedented efforts to combat corruption. This resulted in arrests of numerous influential business-people and politicians from across the political spectrum, although most of them were members of HDZ, which severely damaged the party&#x27;s reputation. The discoveries made by prosecutors were far-reaching and criminal charges were even raised against former prime minister Ivo Sanader and Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polančec, who would later be charged with lengthy prison sentences for criminal activity and abuse of power. In foreign policy, Kosor and her Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor were successful in solving the long-standing border dispute and she is credited with successfully finishing the negotiating process of the Croatian accession to the European Union. On 9 December 2011, she and President Ivo Josipović signed the EU Treaty of Accession in Brussels. A moderate conservative, Kosor ran for another term as party leader after losing the election, however, was defeated by the more conservative Tomislav Karamarko. After months of criticizing his leadership and the new party platform, she was expelled from HDZ by the party&#x27;s High Court for damaging the party&#x27;s reputation.

In 2021, Kosor was awarded with the Grand Order of Queen Jelena with Sash and Morning Star by President of Croatia Zoran Milanović for &quot;extraordinary contribution to the international position and reputation of the Republic of Croatia&quot; and for &quot;the development of relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Croatian people and other states and peoples.&quot;

==Early life==
Jadranka Kosor was born in Lipik to Zorica Belan and Mirko Kosor. She finished primary education in Pakrac. Her parents divorced when she was two, and she spent her childhood living with her grandmother. Her childhood friends describe her as a pretty, smart, and sociable girl that loved poetry and wrote songs. She contested a beauty pageant and was selected runner up for Miss Swimming Pool of Lipik. She studied in Zagreb, where she graduated in law and began working as a journalist from 1972 as a correspondent for &quot;Večernji list&quot; and Radio Zagreb. In 1971, her book of poetry &quot;Koraci&quot; was published by the Pakrac branch of Matica hrvatska. During the Croatian War of Independence, she worked as a radio-journalist and her show explored war topics such as refugee problems and disabled war veterans. She also worked briefly as a correspondent for the BBC during this time.

==Politics==
In 1995, Kosor became a representative in the Croatian Parliament as a member of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). She was also the vice-president of the Croatian Parliament. From 1999 to 2000, she was president of the HDZ&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Association Katarina Zrinski. She is credited with the number of female candidates from the HDZ in the 2000 elections doubling.

Kosor was the vice-president of the HDZ party between 1995 and 1997, and from 2002 up to 2009 when she became the president of the party. In 2003, she became the minister in the Croatian department for Family, Veterans and Inter-generational Solidarity in the Croatian Government of Ivo Sanader.

HDZ nominated her as their presidential candidate for the presidential election of 2005. In the first round, she overtook Boris Mikšić by a few percent to reach the second place. She then faced off Stipe Mesić in the second round, but lost.

In July 2009, she was politically installed as the head of the Croatian Democratic Union following the resignation of Ivo Sanader.

==Prime minister==

On 1 July 2009, Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader suddenly and unexpectedly resigned, and suggested Kosor as the next prime minister. With the support of the coalition partners Kosor went to the President Stjepan Mesić who invited her to form a government. This resulted in the formation of the Kosor cabinet which contained most members of the previous Sanader administration. On 6 July, Parliament approved the proposed cabinet with 83 votes in favor out of 153 members and Kosor was confirmed as the first female Prime Minister of Croatia after independence - actually the third in the history of the republic after two female Prime Ministers of Socialist Republic of Croatia. The Opposition was not pleased with this development calling Sanader a coward and Kosor his puppet saying that an early general election was necessary.

===Domestic policy===
In the first month of her term Kosor, faced with a huge deficit and high unemployment, introduced an emergency budget aimed to reduce spending and the national debt. One of the most unpopular austerity measures taken along with the introduction of the budget was a new income tax called the &quot;crisis tax&quot; (). In addition, the value-added tax rate was increased from 22% to 23%. Businesses criticized the tax hikes as well as the idea of tax code changes in the middle of the fiscal year as an unreasonable burden, while independent economists mostly noted how new taxes would cut consumer spending and further slow down the economy. The Opposition criticized the new measures heavily, calling the crisis tax &quot;harač&quot;, a historical Turkish loanword representing a tax implemented during the Ottoman Empire in the late Middle Ages. Indeed, the government&#x27;s handling of finances was unpopular among the public resulting in the Prime Minister&#x27;s dismal approval rating of 32% by the end of her first month.

In the last quarter of 2009, many public officials, as well as members of the boards of various government agencies, became suspected of participating in corrupt activities. An unprecedented number of officials were detained and arrested under these allegations which resulted in both praise and criticism of Kosor&#x27;s government. The praise was mostly directed by those who believed that the government had finally taken a stronger stance against political corruption, while others criticized the fact that most suspects were, in fact, members of Kosor&#x27;s own Croatian Democratic Union. The Opposition accused the government, especially the prime minister, for political responsibility, claiming that it was impossible that Kosor didn&#x27;t know what was happening around her when she was a vice president of the government almost seven years before becoming prime minister. The accusations grew louder as more and more corruption affairs were tied with the former prime minister, Ivo Sanader. On 30 October 2009 Damir Polančec, member of the HDZ Presidency, resigned as deputy prime minister and minister of the economy following allegations of corruption.

On 3 January 2010, Ivo Sanader announced he was returning to active politics, saying it was a mistake he ever left. He accused Kosor and the members of the HDZ Presidency of failed leadership citing Andrija Hebrang&#x27;s poor result in the first round of the presidential election held just a week earlier. Hebrang received, for HDZ as the largest party in the country, an embarrassing 12% of the votes claiming third place, the lowest result for an HDZ presidential candidate ever. Ivo Josipović, the candidate of the largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, won a landslide victory in the resulting runoff on 10 January. Most political pundits, as well as the majority of the public, believed the true reason of Sanader&#x27;s surprise return was fear that he will eventually be tied with the numerous corruption scandals which have emerged since he left office. On 4 January, the day after Sanader&#x27;s &quot;coup&quot; as it was called by the press, the HDZ Presidency decided to evict Sanader from the party. The Croatian public quickly rallied in support of Kosor against the hugely unpopular former prime minister, resulting in the highest support for any prime minister since polling began, topping at 77% by the end of February.

Throughout 2010, the economy topped corruption as the biggest concern of the government, and the enthusiasm for Kosor and her government soon wore off. Industry shed tens of thousands of jobs, and unemployment soared. Consumer spending reduced drastically compared to record 2007 levels, causing widespread problems in the trade as well as transport industries. The import/export balance did derive a benefit from a large decrease in imports and a more tempered decrease in exports. The continuing declining standard resulted in a quick fall in both the Prime Minister&#x27;s as well as government&#x27;s support. In June, Kosor proposed loosening the labor law and making it more business-friendly. This was greatly opposed by the unions who have organized a petition against the proposed changes demanding a referendum on the issue. The petition was signed by over 700,000 citizens, unprecedented in Croatia. Just as the 2010 Croatian labour law referendum was being prepared, the government decided to drop the proposed changes. The Constitutional Court ultimately declared the referendum issue moot, but ordered the government not to subject any changes to the labor law in the following year. This was seen as a legal way to avoid the referendum which many speculated would be a referendum on the Government rather than on the labor law. The unions criticized the move calling it undemocratic, announcing protests.

In August 2011, at the official celebration of Victory Day, Kosor sent a public greeting to Croatian generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač who were in April of the same year found guilty in a first instance verdict of war crimes and crimes against humanity by ICTY. In 2012, they were both acquitted by the ICTY&#x27;s Appeals Panel and released from custody. Kosor&#x27;s statement was criticized by Serbian president Boris Tadić, leader of the Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS) Milorad Pupovac, Deputy Prime Minister Slobodan Uzelac (SDSS), as well as by leaders of the opposition Social Democratic Party and Croatian People&#x27;s Party. Amnesty International expressed concerns.

===Foreign relations===

Jadranka Kosor signed an agreement with Borut Pahor, the prime minister of Slovenia, in November 2009, that ended Slovenia&#x27;s blockade of Croatia&#x27;s EU accession and allowed Croatian EU entry negotiations to proceed. On 9 December 2011, Prime Minister Kosor and President Ivo Josipović signed EU Accession Treaty in Brussels.

===Standing in opinion polls===


==Post-premiership==
Following HDZ&#x27;s defeat at the 2011 parliamentary election, Kosor handed over power to newly elected prime minister, Social Democrat Zoran Milanović. On 23 December 2011, Kosor was elected Deputy Speaker of the Croatian Parliament and was also chairwoman of the HDZ&#x27;s Deputy Club and leader of the opposition. Kosor contested 2012 HDZ leadership election and came in third out of five candidates. A moderate conservative, Kosor continuously publicly criticized Tomislav Karamarko&#x27;s leadership and the new, more conservative, party platform. In 2012, she testified at the trial in the Fimi Media corruption case against Ivo Sanader. On 12 June 2012, Kosor and Vladimir Šeks were removed from the positions of Deputy Speakers. In 2013, she was expelled from HDZ for &quot;damaging the reputation of the party&quot;.

Kosor continued as an independent, considerably more liberal, politician and eventually formed a deputy club with two Croatian Civic Party MPs. Kosor voted in favour of presenting the issue of the 2013 referendum on banning same-sex marriage before the Constitutional Court, and against the proposed Constitutional change which represented a change from her previous position on homosexuality and same-sex marriage since she had been known for being against the expansion of LGBT rights. She also voted for the Life Partnership Act which gave same-sex couples in Croatia rights equal to heterosexual married couples. After receiving death threats in 2015, Kosor was granted police protection. After speculation that she might be the SDP&#x27;s candidate, Kosor eventually decided to participate in the 2015 parliamentary election as a candidate for the liberal Successful Croatia coalition in the 5th electoral district. She wasn&#x27;t elected to the parliament. She continued to criticize Tomislav Karamarko and Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović as well as Bridge of Independent Lists party for their indecisiveness. In February 2016, she called on Prime Minister Tihomir Orešković to remove Zlatko Hasanbegović from the position of the Minister of Culture after photograph of him wearing a cap with an Ustaše badge was published. In August 2016, Kosor stated that yelling Za dom spremni was &quot;an insult to war veterans and their friends who gave their lives for a democratic, independent, and free Croatia&quot;.

Kosor is very active on Twitter where she writes on daily events and statements by politicians. She also maintains a personal blog - &quot;Day After Yesterday - On Obverses and Reverses of Politics&quot;. In 2017, she published a book which included texts she wrote on her blog and columns written for the Slovenian leftist newspaper Dnevnik in the period from 2015 to 2017 in which she commented on Croatian interior and foreign politics.

In 2023, she reached the semi-final of Croatia&#x27;s Masked Singer.

==Personal life==

Jadranka Kosor was married twice; between 1971 and 1981 to Hrvoje Markul, an editor of the HTV Entertainment Program, and between 1984 and 1993 to Ivo Škopljanac, the radio host. Her son Lovro Škopljanac (b. 1984) works as a senior assistant at the Department of Comparative Literature at the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.

She has published five books - two of poetry, two related to the Croatian War of Independence and one containing her comments on Croatian politics. Kosor received &quot;The Golden Pen Award of the Croatian Journalists&#x27; Association&quot;, &quot;European Union&#x27;s Humanitarian Award&quot;, &quot;European Circle Award of the Croatian European House&quot; and &quot;HRT&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award &quot;Ivan Šibl&quot;&quot;. She is an honorary member of the &quot;Association of Parents of Deceased Veterans&quot;, Honorary Vice President of the &quot;Association of the Deafblind &quot;Dodir&quot;&quot;, Honorary President of the &quot;Association of Homeland Defence War Veterans - HVIDRA&quot;, Honorary President of the &quot;Association of Croatian Homeland Defence War Veterans Treated for PTSD of the Šibenik-Knin County - &quot;Tvrđava Knin&quot;&quot; and Honorary President of the &quot;International Committee of Humanists for the Protection of Children and Families from Abuse and Violence&quot;.

<text>Nanette Fabray (born Ruby Bernadette Nanette Theresa Fabares; October 27, 1920 – February 22, 2018) was an American actress, singer and dancer. She began her career performing in vaudeville as a child and became a musical-theatre actress during the 1940s and 1950s, acclaimed for her role in &quot;High Button Shoes&quot; (1947) and winning a Tony Award in 1949 for her performance in &quot;Love Life&quot;. In the mid-1950s, she served as Sid Caesar&#x27;s comic partner on &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, for which she won three Emmy Awards, and appeared with Fred Astaire in the film musical &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;. From 1979 to 1984, she played Katherine Romano, the mother of lead character Ann Romano, on the TV series &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;. She also appeared as the mother of Christine Armstrong (played by her niece Shelley Fabares) in the television series &quot;Coach&quot;.

Fabray had significant hearing impairment and was a longtime advocate for the rights of the deaf and hearing-impaired people. Her honors included the President&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award and the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanitarian Award.

==Early life==
Fabray was born Ruby Bernadette Nanette Theresa Fabares on October 27, 1920 in San Diego, California to Lily Agnes (McGovern), a housewife, and Raoul Bernard Fabares, a train conductor. 

She used one of her middle names, Nanette, as her first name in honor of a beloved aunt from San Diego named Nanette. Throughout life, she often used the nickname Nan. Her family resided in Los Angeles, and Fabray&#x27;s mother was instrumental in introducing her to showbusiness as a child. At a young age, she studied tap dance with, among others, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson. She made her professional stage debut as Miss New Year&#x27;s Eve 1923 at the Million Dollar Theater at the age of three. She spent much of her childhood appearing in vaudeville productions as a dancer and singer under the name Baby Nan. She appeared with stars such as Ben Turpin. 

Despite her mother&#x27;s influence, Fabray was not interested in showbusiness as a young girl. Consequently, as an adult she did not believe in pushing children into performing at a young age. However, because of her early dance training, Fabray considered herself to be primarily a tap dancer. Despite a persistent rumor, she was never a regular or recurring guest in the Our Gang series, but she did appear as an extra during a party scene.

Fabray&#x27;s parents divorced when she was nine, but they continued living together for financial reasons. During the Great Depression, her mother converted their home into a boarding house, which Fabray and her siblings helped to run, and her main job was ironing clothes. In her early teenage years, Fabray attended the Max Reinhardt School of the Theatre on a scholarship. She then attended Hollywood High School, participating in the drama program and graduating in 1939. She bested classmate Alexis Smith for the lead in the school play during her senior year. Fabray entered Los Angeles Junior College in the fall of 1939, but she did not fare well and withdrew a few months later. 

Fabray experienced difficulty in school because of an undiagnosed hearing impairment. She was later diagnosed with conductive hearing loss related to congenital, progressive otosclerosis in her twenties after an acting teacher encouraged her to have her hearing tested. Fabray said of the experience, &quot;It was a revelation to me. All these years I had thought I was stupid, but in reality, I just had a hearing problem.&quot; 

In 2004, Fabray was interviewed for the oral-history project of the Archives of American Television.

==Career==

===Theatre===
At the age of 19, Fabray made her feature-film debut as one of Bette Davis&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting in &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939). She appeared in two additional films that year for Warner Bros., &quot;The Monroe Doctrine&quot; (short) and &quot;A Child Is Born&quot;, but was not signed to a long-term studio contract. She next appeared in the stage production &quot;Meet the People&quot; in Los Angeles in 1940, which then toured the United States in 1940–1941. In the show, she sang the opera aria &quot;Caro nome&quot; from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; while tap dancing. During the show&#x27;s New York run, Fabray was invited to perform the &quot;Caro nome&quot; number for a benefit at Madison Square Garden with Eleanor Roosevelt as the main speaker. Ed Sullivan was the master of ceremonies for the event and mispronounced her name, prompting her to subsequently change the spelling of her name from Fabares to the more easily pronounced Fabray. 
Artur Rodziński, conductor of the New York Philharmonic, saw Fabray&#x27;s performance in &quot;Meet the People&quot; and offered to sponsor operatic vocal training for her at the Juilliard School. She studied opera at Juilliard with Lucia Dunham in 1941 while performing in her first Broadway musical, Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot;, with Danny Kaye and Eve Arden. However, as she preferred performing in musical theatre over opera, she withdrew from the school after about five months. She became a successful musical-theatre actress in New York during the 1940s and early 1950s, starring in such productions as &quot;By Jupiter&quot; (1942), &quot;My Dear Public&quot; (1943), &quot;Jackpot&quot; (1944), &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot; (1946), &quot;High Button Shoes&quot; (1947), &quot;Arms and the Girl&quot; (1950) and &quot;Make a Wish&quot; (1951). In 1949, she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her portrayal of Susan Cooper in the Kurt Weill/Alan Jay Lerner musical &quot;Love Life&quot;. She received a Tony nomination for her role as Nell Henderson in &quot;Mr. President&quot; in 1963 after an 11-year absence from the New York stage. Fabray continued to tour in musicals for many years, appearing in such shows as &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; and &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;.

===Television and film===

In the mid-1940s, Fabray worked regularly for NBC on a variety of programs in the Los Angeles area. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, she made her first high-profile national television appearances performing on a number of variety programs such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot;.

She also appeared on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; as a guest star opposite Sid Caesar. She appeared as a regular on &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; from 1954 to 1956, winning three Emmys. Fabray left the show after a misunderstanding when her business manager made unreasonable demands for her third-season contract. Fabray and Caesar did not reconcile until years later. In December 1956, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; titled &quot;The Family Nobody Wanted&quot; alongside Lew Ayres and Tim Hovey.

In 1961, Fabray starred in 26 episodes of &quot;Westinghouse Playhouse&quot;, a half-hour sitcom series that also was known as &quot;The Nanette Fabray Show&quot; or &quot;Yes, Yes Nanette&quot;. The character was loosely based on herself and her life as a newlywed with new stepchildren.

Fabray appeared as the mother of the main character in several television series such as &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;Coach&quot;, in which she played mother to real-life niece Shelley Fabares, who became a regular cast member in &quot;One Day at a Time.&quot;

Fabray made 13 guest appearances on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. She performed on multiple episodes of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Kraft Music Hall&quot; and &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. She was a panelist on 230 episodes of the long-running game show &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;, a mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and later a panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1973. Other recurring game-show appearances included participation in &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, &quot;He Said, She Said&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot;, &quot;Stump the Stars&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, &quot;All Star Secrets&quot;, and &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

She appeared in guest-starring roles on &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. During the PBS program &quot;Pioneers of Television: Sitcoms&quot;, Mary Tyler Moore credited Fabray with inspiring her trademark comedic crying technique. In 1986, Fabray was cast in the pilot episode of the unsold TBS sitcom project &quot;Here to Stay&quot;.

In 1953, Fabray played her best-known screen role as a Betty Comden-like playwright in the MGM musical comedy &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, performing in, among others, the musical numbers &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; and &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;; and in &quot;Triplets&quot; which was also included in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot;. Fabray&#x27;s additional film credits include &quot;The Happy Ending&quot; (1969), &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot; (1978) and &quot;Amy&quot; (1981).

Fabray&#x27;s final work occurred in 2007 when she appeared in &quot;The Damsel Dialogues&quot;, a musical revue at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks, California.

==Personal life==
Fabray&#x27;s first husband David Tebet was in television marketing and talent and later became a vice president at NBC. According to Fabray, their marriage ended in divorce partially because of her depression, anxiety and insecurity related to her worsening hearing loss. Her second husband was screenwriter Ranald MacDougall, whose writing credits include &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and who served as president of the Writers Guild of America in the early 1970s, They were married from 1957 until MacDougall&#x27;s death in 1973 and had one son together, Jamie MacDougall.

Fabray lived in Pacific Palisades, California, and was the aunt of singer/actress Shelley Fabares. Her niece&#x27;s 1984 wedding to &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; actor Mike Farrell was held at her home. Fabray was associated with her longtime neighbor Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign for the governorship of California in 1966.

She was hospitalized for almost two weeks after being rendered unconscious by a falling pipe backstage during a live broadcast of &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; in 1955. The audience in the studio heard her screams and Sid Caesar had at first been told that she had been killed in the freak accident. Fabray suffered a serious concussion along with associated temporary vision impairment and photosensitivity/photophobia. Later, she realized that she had avoided being directly impaled because she was bending down rather than standing straight at the time of the accident. In 1978, during the filming of &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot;, Fabray suffered a second major concussion after falling, hitting her neck on the sidewalk and the back of her head on a rock. The accident was caused when a live elephant appearing in the film stampeded when it was spooked by a drunken bystander. Fabray developed associated memory loss and visual issues such as nystagmus but had to finish her scenes, including one involving a car chase. She was closely directed, coached, and fed lines as she could not remember her lines or cues as a result of the concussion. She was filmed from specific angles to hide the abnormal eye movements that the concussion had temporarily caused.

==Activism==
A longtime champion of hearing awareness and support of the deaf, she sat on boards and spoke at many related functions. A forward-thinking proponent of total communication and teaching the deaf language and communication in any way possible, including American Sign Language and not just the oralism method of the time, Fabray was one of, if not the first, to use sign language on [live] television, something which she continued to showcase on many programs on which she made appearances, including the &quot;Carol Burnett Show, Match Game &#x27;73&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. She even contributed the story line to an entire 1982 episode of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, which focused on hearing loss awareness and acceptance, treatment options, and sign language. Fabray appeared in a 1986 infomercial for hearing device and deafness support products for House Ear Institute. In 2001, she wrote to advice columnist Dear Abby to decry the loud background music played on television programs. A founding member of the National Captioning Institute, she also was one of the first big names to bring awareness to the need for media closed-captioning.

Likewise, after the passing of her second husband, Randy MacDougall, Fabray also started to learn about the tribulations associated with spousal death and began to bring awareness to the need for changes in the law for widows and widowers. She focused her later years on campaigning for widows&#x27; rights, particularly pertaining to women&#x27;s inheritance laws, taxes, and asset protection.

==Death==
Fabray died on February 22, 2018, at the Canterbury nursing home in California at the age of 97 from natural causes.

==Honors==
A Tony and three-time Primetime Emmy award winner, Fabray has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1986, she received a Life Achievement award from the Screen Actors Guild.

She won a Golden Apple award from the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Press Club in 1960 along with Janet Leigh for being a Most Cooperative actress.

She was awarded the President&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award and the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanitarian Award for her long efforts on behalf of the deaf and hard-of-hearing.

<text>The World League for Freedom and Democracy (WLFD) is an international non-governmental organization of anti-communist politicians and groups. It was founded in 1952 as the World Anti-Communist League (WACL) under the initiative of Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Republic of China (first on Mainland China, after 1949 on Taiwan) and retired General Charles A. Willoughby. During the Cold War, WACL actively participated in anti-communist and anti-Soviet positions.

In 1990, the organization changed to its current name, but has preserved its traditions and former ties. It unites representatives from more than 100 countries and has eight regional divisions. It has its headquarters in Taipei, Taiwan.

==History==
The WLFD descended from the Asian Peoples&#x27; Anti-Communist League. Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, Elpidio Quirino of the Republic of the Philippines, and Syngman Rhee of the Republic of Korea founded the APACL in Jinhae, the wartime capital city of the Republic of Korea (ROK) on 15 June 1954. Its first general conference was held in that city and was hosted to advocate and support the causes of anti-communism. The other participating states, including South Vietnam, Thailand, Okinawa, Japan, Hong Kong, and Macau also sent representatives.

===World Freedom Day===

World Freedom Day ) is a memorial day celebrated on 23 January in Taiwan and South Korea. In Taiwan, the event is also known as 123 Freedom Day (), due to a hand gesture devised by the &quot;Voice of Justice&quot;. The thumb (one) represents freedom, the V sign is two, and the third finger represents the Three Principles of the People. World Freedom Day marks the return of some 22,000 ex-communist war prisoners of the Korean War (1950–1953) to Taiwan, of whom 14,000 Chinese soldiers arrived at Keelung Harbor on 23 January 1954, and were given the title &quot;Anti-Communist Heroes&quot;. The Republic of China (ROC) government subsequently declared 23 January as World Freedom Day to honor these soldiers, and created the &quot;Anti-Communist League&quot; (which later became the World League for Freedom and Democracy) to fight communist expansion worldwide. The league is led by President Yao Eng-chi, a former Kuomintang-MP and Secretary-General Ger Yeong-kuang, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University. Every year World Freedom Day Celebrations are held in Taiwan, and the event is attended by both local and foreign delegates from all over the world. Usually, the president of the ROC delivers congratulations, and cultural events are held. 

===Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy===
The Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy (APLFD) was founded in 1954 as the Asian Peoples&#x27; Anti-Communist League in Chinhae, South Korea with the support of the governments of the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan (as the Republic of China). The APLFD is a non-profit international organization for interchanges among the Asians for peace and prosperity of the region.

The APLFD was founded in the same year and under the same international background as the forming of the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), or the Manila Pact, in 1954, when the Second World War had concluded. However, while the SEATO (1954–1977) was sort of an Asian Nato in nature, the APLFD is a people&#x27;s organization trying to secure peace and prosperity through ideas and convictions and friendship.

Having founded the APACL, the government of the Republic of China prepared to organize the second conference and chose Taipei City as the place to set up the Republic of China Chapter of the APACL on 1 July 1954. Ku Cheng-kang, President of the Chinese Refugees Relief Association of the Republic of China, was designated as the first president of this Chapter. Over the years, successors to the presidency of the Republic of China Chapter are Clement C. P. Chang, Chao Tze-chi, Yao Eng-chi, and Tseng Yung-chuan. the president was Yao Eng-chi, former Vice President of the ROC Legislative Yuan (Parliament) and also Senior Advisor to the President of the Republic of China on Taiwan.

===World Anti-Communist League===
In 1966 the memberships of the APACL had increased to 27, in Asia, Australia, and Africa. At its 12th Conference in Seoul on 3 November 1966, a fifteen-member committee was formed to discuss the expansion of this organization. The committee eventually decided to set up a new anti-communist organization, including the APACL, regional organizations, and an international anti-communist organization. On 7 November 1966, the delegates adopted the &quot;Charter of the World Anti-Communist League&quot; at the plenary session. It also resolved that the Republic of China Chapter was in charge of organizing the first General Conference.

The Charter of the World Anti-Communist League (WACL), with 8 chapters and 32 articles, came into effect on 1 April 1967. It stated that the WACL should immediately set up its regional organizations in six regions: Asia (now known as Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy), the Middle East (now known as Middle East Solidarity Council), Africa (now known as the African Organization for Freedom and Democracy), and Europe (now known as the European Council for World Freedom), North America (now known as the North American Federation for Freedom and Democracy), and Latin America (now known as the Federation of Latin American Democratic Organization). The organization in the Asian region was the main force to push for the mission of the World League.

===Renaming===

To adjust to the worldwide political changes after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and to strive for recruiting more people to join, the WACL held its 22nd General Conference in Brussels, Belgium on 23 July 1990, and the delegates resolved that the organization should be renamed the &quot;World League for Freedom and Democracy&quot; (WLFD). This resolution came into effect on 1 January 1991.

On 21 August 1991, with the new name, the WLFD held its 23rd General Conference in San Jose, Costa Rica. Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier, President of Costa Rica, and vice presidents from six countries in Latin America, gave speeches. The conference passed a resolution to set up the Presidency of League, a new post to highlight the leading center of the WLFD and also to take responsibility to organize WLFD activities. Chao Tze-chi, President of the Republic of China Chapter of WLFD, was elected as the first President of the WLFD, and re-elected in 1995. U Chae-sung of the ROK was named as the Secretary-General.

On 19 January 2006, the WLFD adopted its charter amendment in the 34th General Conference. According to the Amendment, the President of the League shall be &quot;the top official of the League&quot; and shall represent the League, and shall supervise the performance and development of the League in compliance with the charter. According to the previous charter of the WLFD, the President of the League shall be &quot;the Leader of the League&quot; and shall represent the League. This person shall supervise the performance and development of the League in compliance with the charter.

According to the Charter of the WLFD, the President of the League shall be elected by and from the members of the executive board of the League. The result of the election shall be reported to the General Conference. The President shall hold office for a term of four years and shall be eligible for re-election. In October 2000, all members of the executive board approved Yao Eng-chi, President of the WLFD ROC Chapter, as the third President of the League during the Executive Board Meeting in New York City The executive board also amended the charter to add several positions such as four vice presidents and two deputy secretaries-general. The decision made by the executive board was also confirmed by the members at the 31st WLFD General Conference in Taipei, ROC, on 13 January 2001. President Yao Eng-chi was re-elected as President of the League at the 33rd WLFD General Conference in Melbourne, Australia, on 20 December 2003. Ger Yeong-kuang was named as Secretary-General of the League. On 1 August 2008, Ger resigned and was succeeded by Hsieh Wen-huang, Parliamentary Assistant to Vice President Tseng Yung-chuan of the ROC Legislative Yuan (Parliament). Hsieh resigned; Chou Yujen&#x27;s was nominated to replace him on 23 January 2013.

==Membership==

According to the charter, national, regional or international organizations that subscribe to the purposes of the League are eligible for membership. Membership shall consist of Regular Members with voting rights and Associate Members without voting rights.

The Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy (APLFD) was formed in 1954 as the Asian Peoples&#x27; Anti-Communist League. The APLFD Secretariat was first established in Saigon, Vietnam in 1957; then the Secretariat moved to Manila in 1964. Three years later, the Secretariat moved back again to Saigon until its fall in 1975. After some compromise and a resolution, the APLFD Secretariat was re-established in Taipei, Taiwan in 1976 where it remains active. In 1983, at its conference in Fiji, it changed its name to the Asian Pacific Democratic League.

The APLFD has 18 member nations. It holds an annual conference every year.

The number of members in Denmark is unknown, but several politicians have or have been connected to the organization. Progress Party leader Pia Kjærsgaard participated in 1988 as WACL&#x27;s guest at the organization&#x27;s congress in Taipei. The Danish WACL leader has been municipal politician Erik Dissing.

The French chapter was headed by Suzanne Labin. The president of the German section as of 2012 has been Axel Fischer.

In Sweden, a department of WACL was established in 1967. The Swedish organization has been characterized by strong participation among exiled Estonians. Among the member organizations in the late 1960s were Democratic Alliance, Baltic Committee, Nordic War and UN Veterans Association and the Committee for a Free Asia. The National League of Sweden was also linked to the organization for some time. Swedish chairman has been Birger Nerman (1967–70), Arvo Horm (1970–1984), Birger Hagård (1984–88) and Åke J. Ek (1988–2011).

==Controversies==
In 1978, British anticommunist activist Geoffrey Stewart-Smith, who led the British affiliate out of WACL, declared that despite a publicized housecleaning, &quot;The World Anti-Communist League is largely a collection of Nazis, Fascists, anti-Semites, sellers of forgeries, vicious racialists, and corrupt self-seekers. It has evolved into an anti-Semitic international.&quot;

In 1978, Roger Pearson became the World Chairman of the WACL. Pearson was described in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article as having neo-Nazi associations and sources report that as a result of an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1978 critical of WACL and alleging extreme right wing politics of Pearson that either he was expelled from WACL or at least was pressured into resigning from his position as World chairman.

The US chapter of WACL, the United States Council for World Freedom (USCWF) was founded in 1981 by Major General John K. Singlaub. Singlaub was the former US Chief of Staff of both United Nations and American forces in South Korea, but was relieved in 1977 by U.S. President Jimmy Carter after publicly criticizing Carter&#x27;s decision to reduce the number of troops on the peninsula. Singlaub became a member of the WACL in 1980, and founded and became president of its U.S. chapter, the United States Council for World Freedom. This branch generated controversy when it supported Nicaraguan guerrillas in the Iran–Contra affair and, in 1981, the USCWF was placed under watch by the Anti-Defamation League, which said that the organization had increasingly become &quot;a point of contact for extremists, racists, and anti-Semites&quot;. During the 1980s, the USCWF and WACL conducted a purge of these elements, and invited ADL observers to monitor its conferences; by 1985, the Anti-Defamation League declared itself &quot;satisfied that substantial progress has been made since 1981 in ridding the organization of racists and anti-Semites.&quot;

It is alleged that in the mid-1980s WACL had become a supplier of arms to anti-communist rebel movements in southern Africa, Central America, Afghanistan and the Far East. During the 1980s, the WACL was particularly active in Latin America, notably by aiding the Contra forces in Nicaragua. During this period, WACL was criticized for its presence in the organization of neo-Nazis, war criminals, and people linked to death squads and assassinations. Other allegations have included reports claim that the World League for Freedom and Democracy is responsible for producing what its opponents call &quot;troops of killers&quot;, while ostensibly organizing to provide support for Corazon Aquino from the right-wing in the Philippines and for supporting the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) movement in Mozambique.

The World Anti-Communist League held annual conferences at various locations throughout the world. Numerous groups participated, including the Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. WACL also enjoyed support from many U.S. Congressmen, most notably 2008 presidential nominee Senator John McCain (R-AZ), who sat on the United States Council for World Freedom (USCWF) Board of Directors in the early 1980s. When his membership was brought up during the election, McCain said he resigned from the council in 1984. In 1986, he asked to have his name removed from the group&#x27;s letterhead. However, there was absolutely no evidence that McCain had ever resigned or asked for his name&#x27;s removal from the United States Council for World Freedom.

<text>Lemsip is a British brand of cold and flu remedies for treating people with cold, cough and flu.

==Products==
Their original and best-known product is the titular lemon-flavoured hot drink containing 650 mg of paracetamol (an analgesic), and 10 mg phenylephrine hydrochloride (a decongestant) to help to relieve headache, fever, blocked nose, body aches and pains, and a sore throat.

In 1995 the Lemsip Max range was launched, which included lemon, blackcurrant and &quot;Breathe Easy&quot; hot drink flavours, and saw a variety of capsule products added to the range, including Lemsip Max Cold &amp; Flu Capsules. The entire Lemsip Max range contains the maximum level of active ingredients allowed for general sales listing in the UK. In 2016 it was the fourth biggest selling branded over-the-counter medication sold in Great Britain, with sales of £63.9 million. 

In 2007 Lemsip launched Lemsip Max All In One hot drinks in Lemon, Wild Berry and Hot Orange, and Breathe Easy flavours. In 2008 Lemsip launched a Liquid into the Lemsip Max All In One range. The range contains 200 mg of guaifenesin which helps to relieve chesty cough, in addition to 1000 mg of paracetamol and 12.2 mg of phenylephrine hydrochloride (12.18 mg of phenylephrine hydrochloride in Lemsip Max All In One Liquid) which aims to relieve headache, sore throat, fever, body aches and pains, and a blocked nose.

The Lemsip range now contains capsules, tablets, liquids, and hot drink sachets.

==Side effects, contraindications, and interactions==

Possible side effects include hypersensitivity, blood problems or, above the recommended dose, pancreatitis and vomiting.

Taking Lemsip alongside other medicine containing paracetamol can cause an overdose, potentially resulting in serious liver and kidney damage.

Phenylephrine, which alongside paracetamol is one of Lemsip&#x27;s two primary active ingredients and is intended to be responsible for most of the product&#x27;s claimed effects, was discovered to be ineffective as a decongestant in 2015, leading some pharmacists to call for the ingredient to be banned.

==Manufacturing==
Lemsip is manufactured in parent company Reckitt&#x27;s Hull and Nottingham sites.

<text>A breathing apparatus or breathing set is equipment which allows a person to breathe in a hostile environment where breathing would otherwise be impossible, difficult, harmful, or hazardous, or assists a person to breathe. A respirator, medical ventilator, or resuscitator may also be considered to be breathing apparatus. Equipment that supplies or recycles breathing gas other than ambient air in a space used by several people is usually referred to as being part of a life-support system, and a life-support system for one person may include breathing apparatus, when the breathing gas is specifically supplied to the user rather than to the enclosure in which the user is the occupant.

Breathing apparatus may be classified by type in several ways:
* by breathing gas source: self-contained gas supply, remotely supplied gas, or purified ambient air,
* by environment: underwater/hyperbaric, terrestrial/normobaric, or high altitude/hypobaric,
* by breathing circuit type: open, semi-closed, or closed circuit, 
* by gas supply type: constant flow, supply on demand, or supplemental,
* by ventilatory driving force: the breathing effort of the user, or mechanical work from an external source,
* by operational pressure regime: at ambient pressure or in isolation from ambient pressure,
* by gas mixture: air, oxygen enriched air, pure oxygen or mixed gases,
* by purpose: underwater diving, mountaineering, aeronautical, industrial, emergency and escape, and medical.

The user respiratory interface is the delivery system by which the breathing apparatus guides the breathing gas flow to and from the user. Some form of facepiece, hood or helmet is usual, but for some medical interventions an invasive method may be necessary.

Any given unit is a member of several types. The well-known recreational scuba set is a self-contained, open circuit, demand supplied, high pressure stored air, ambient pressure, underwater diving type, delivered through a bite-grip secured mouthpiece.

==Definition and scope==
Semantically, the term &quot;breathing apparatus&quot; implies any set of equipment and materials specifically intended to enable or facilitate breathing, which could include equipment as basic as a snorkel or artificial airway, or as complex as an anaesthetic machine or a space suit. Actual usage varies, and breathing apparatus, breathing set, ventilator and respirator have similar and overlapping meanings which vary depending on the sources chosen. &quot;Breathing set&quot; appears to be a secondary synonym for breathing apparatus, as internet searches appear to all be redirected to breathing apparatus. According to Merriam-Webster, a ventilator can be a medical device to provide artificially assisted respiration, or equipment to circulate fresh air through a space, while a respirator is usually a mask worn to protect the user from particulate contaminants in the air, but can also mean a device for providing artificial respiration. The usage in the sense of a filtering mask dates to the early 19th century and the artificial respiration sense dates to the second half of the 19th century, so both are well established.

The UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) distinguishes between respirators and breathing apparatus. Respirators are described as filtering devices, which may be powered, using a motor to pass ambient air through the filter, or unpowered, relying on the wearer&#x27;s breathing to draw ambient air through the filter. The distinguishing features of a respirator in this context appear to be that the air is not significantly compressed at any stage, is filtered, and is at approximately ambient pressure. The HSE definition for breathing apparatus is that they use a supply of breathing quality gas from an independent source, such as air compressors or compressed gas cylinders. In this case compression of the supply gas at some stage is implied. Both respirators and breathing apparatus are classed as respiratory protective equipment by the HSE.

Vocabulary.com describes a breathing apparatus as &quot;a device that facilitates breathing in cases of respiratory failure&quot;, which is a functional description of a medical ventilator, or a resuscitator.

McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms defines breathing apparatus as &quot;An appliance that enables a person to function in irrespirable or poisonous gases or fluids; contains a supply of oxygen and a regenerator which removes the carbon dioxide exhaled&quot;, which is the description of any type or application of rebreather.

===Breathing gas source===
The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) uses the source of the breathing gas to distinguish between types of breathing apparatus, and considers respirators to be a type or class of breathing apparatus:

An atmosphere-supplying respirator is a breathing apparatus that supplies the user with breathing gas from a source independent of the ambient atmosphere, such as supplied-air respirators (SARs) and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is a type of atmosphere-supplying breathing apparatus in which the breathing gas source is carried by the user.

A supplied-air respirator (SAR), or airline respirator, is a type of atmosphere-supplying breathing apparatus which uses a hose to supply breathing gas from a source which is not carried by the user. 

An air-purifying respirator is a breathing apparatus which uses a filter, cartridge, or canister, to remove specific air contaminants by passing ambient air through the air-purifying component. No distinction is made based on the mechanism of passing the air through the purifying component – it may be the lungs of the user or a mechanical device.

The breathing gas source may be the ambient atmosphere, compressed air supplied from a low pressure compressor in real time, oxygen enriched air supplied from an oxygen concentrator, high-pressure stored compressed air, supercritical compressed air, oxygen or blended gas mixtures, liquid oxygen, chemically generated oxygen, or a combination of ambient atmosphere and another of these sources.

===Breathing gas regulator===
When using a pressurised gas supply, the breathing gas must be supplied to the respiratory interface at a suitable pressure for inhalation, which is close to ambient pressure. This is generally done by a breathing gas regulator, a pressure reduction regulator, which reduces the gas supply pressure from the supply line. Exhalation is usually to the surroundings at ambient pressure, but in special cases such as built-in breathing systems and gas reclaim systems, it may be exhausted to a significantly lower pressure, sometimes at a remote location, and may require a back-pressure regulator to do this safely.

==Breathing circuit type==

Supplied gas breathing apparatus can be categorised by how the gas is supplied to the user. There are several combinations of options

===Constant flow===

The gas can be supplied continuously, in what is known as a constant flow, continuous flow, or free-flow system. The user inhales from the stream of fresh gas passing the face, and exhales back into the same stream. Supply rate must be sufficient that at reasonably foreseeable work rates, the inhaled gas does not include too much of the previously exhaled gas. This is simple, but wasteful of supplied gas.

===Demand===
The gas can be supplied on demand, when the user inhales, using the pressure drop at the start of inhalation to control the opening of a demand valve, and the automatically stops when there is no demand. This is more conservative in gas usage, but has a higher work of breathing. It requires a facepiece that seals moderately well to the user, with a small internal volume to limit dead space. Some demand supplied breathing apparatus can be swithced to continuous flow mode.

===Open circuit===

Open circuit breathing apparatus is any breathing apparatus that does not recycle any of the breathing gas, and discharges it all to the surroundings.

Supply can be further classified as positive and negative pressure systems, based on the pressure maintained when flow has stopped, and whether the breathing gas pressure in the apparatus ever drops below ambient pressure. Open circuit systems without mixing during delivery are simple and the gas supplied is consistent and reliable.

===Enriched gas===
Both constant flow and demand supply can also provide gas from two sources, one of them being the ambient atmosphere, in what is generally referred to as supplemental oxygen provision, frequently used for medical purposes where the user is at risk for medical hypoxia, and at high altitudes where the oxygen partial pressure is naturally low.

===Closed and semi-closed circuit===

Closed and semi-closed circuit breathing sets, also known as rebreathers and gas extenders, are breathing apparatus that absorb the carbon dioxide from, and add oxygen to, a user&#x27;s exhaled breath, allowing unused oxygen and diluent (if present) to be recycled. A rebreather system may be used for any application of a supplied gas breathing set. It may be more complex than open circuit if the mixture must be controlled, and for short endurance applications may be heavier. There may be a greater fire hazard due to high oxygen concentration. In other applications, when long endurance and reasonably light weight is required, it may allow a large saving of gas and be much simpler or lighter than the equivalent open circuit option. Rebreather systems can be closed or semi-closed circuit, have a pendulum or loop flow path configuration, and the gas can be circulated by the breathing of the user through non-return valves, (almost all self-contained units), by the energy of the injected fresh gas, (Dräger Modell 1915 &quot;Bubikopf&quot;, DM20 and DM40, and US Navy Mk V helium helmet gas extenders,), or by an external power input (the oxygen in a space suit is circulated by an electric fan).
When powered by breathing effort, rebreather units will have an elevated work of breathing, particularly with high gas densities at great depth, which is a limiting factor for diving rebreathers, even when the diluent is helium.

===Self-contained or remotely supplied===
Breathing apparatus can also be categorised as self-contained, where everything is carried by the user, or remotely supplied, with a hose to supply gas from the supply panel and in some cases a return hose for the exhaled gas.

Remotely supplied applications include:
*Surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE) is diving equipment supplied with breathing gas using a diver&#x27;s umbilical or airline from the surface, such as from a boat or offshore platform.
*supplied-air respirators (SAR). or airline respirators, use a hose to supply breathing gas from a source which is not carried by the user. 
*Built-in breathing systems in submarines or hyperbaric chambers.
* Some space suits and pressure suits,
* Some diving rebreathers. When remotely supplied they are likely to be semi-closed circuit, and called gas extenders, and their main function is likely to be to save expensive helium diluent gas. In helium reclaim systems, exhaled gas is returned to the surface to be recycled.
*Flight crew breathing apparatus
*Aircraft emergency oxygen systems for passengers in commercial airliners.

Self-contained applications include:
*Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), used out of water, worn by rescue workers, firefighters and others in contaminated, toxic or hypoxic atmospheres
*Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba), used underwater for recreational and occupational diving
*Escape sets, including underwater diving bailout sets
*Most rebreather sets,
*Mountaineering breathing apparatus, which provides supplementary oxygen from a supply carried by the user,
*Air-purifying respirators, which filter contaminants from ambient air.

==User respiratory interface==

The user respiratory interface, also commonly referred to as the facepiece, is the delivery system by which the breathing apparatus controls breathing gas flow to and from the user. The choice of interface type and the fit can significantly influence convenience, effectiveness, comfort, and sometimes safety. Several types are in use:

===Nasal cannula===
A nasal cannula is relatively unobtrusive and is widely used for supplemental oxygen. The basic version is used to deliver continuous flow supplemental oxygen at rates from 1 to 6 litres per minute. It has two short prongs that fit into the nostrils for delivery, that are connected to a common tube, which is usually hooked over the ears for support. The more complex reservoir cannula is an oxygen conserving supplemental oxygen administration device which accumulates constant flow oxygen in a small reservoir below the nose during exhalation and delivers it in a bolus at the beginning of the next inhalation, which ensures that most of it reaches the parts of the lung in which gas exchange occurs, and little is wasted in dead space.

===Nasal mask===
A nasal mask covers the nose and seals against the upper lip, the sides of the nose, and the bridge of the nose.

===Nasal pillow mask===
A nasal pillow mask seals on the rim of the nostrils. It is used in stable patients with sleep-disordered breathing.

===Artificial airway===
An artificial airway uses a medical device to provide a patent airway. This requires intervention by a competent person, and may be supraglottic, infraglottic, or surgically placed. These applications are mostly used in emergency medicine and surgery. Devices in this class include laryngeal mask airways, esophageal-tracheal combitubes, endotracheal tubes, and tracheostomy tubes.

===Mouthpiece===

A mouthpiece, usually held in place by a bite-grip, and sealed by the lips, is common in scuba equipment, snorkels, and some types of escape breathing apparatus. A mouthpiece is simple and effective, with minimal dead space, and reliably seals without need for adjustment, but must be actively held in place by the user, and can cause jaw fatigue over long periods. A mouthpiece retaining strap may be used to reduce jaw fatigue and the risk of losing grip on the mouthpiece in an emergency. A mouthpiece only allows mouth breathing of the delivered gas, and it may be necessary to block the nose to prevent bypass. A mouthpiece makes intelligible speech difficult or impossible, and eating or drinking require temporary removal.

===Oral mask===
An oral mask fits inside the mouth between the teeth and lips, with a guide to prevent the tongue from obstructing the airway. They are not often used.

===Breathing mask===
A breathing mask, also called a facepiece, is a component which covers the mouth and nose, sometimes also the eyes and other parts of the face, and may seal against the face. A breathing mask is usually effective, allows mouth and nose breathing, and can usually be sealed adequately without effort by the user. A wide range of designs are available depending on the application. The disadvantages are that the user cannot eat or drink while the mask is in place, and some models may interfere with speech, while others may have relatively large dead space. Three basic configurations are distinguished by the area they cover.

The orinasal mask, also called oro-nasal, oral-nasal, or quarter mask, covers the mouth and nostrils and seals to the front of the face on the bridge and sides of the nose and mouth and the chin with little dead space.

The half-mask extends below the chin, and the full-face mask covers the eyes as well as the nose and mouth, and can have a dead space so large that an inner orinasal mask is provided to reduce the dead space. A diving half-mask used in scuba and freediving covers the eyes and nose, and is not breathing apparatus.

A full-face mask is generally only used when including the eyes in the protected space is necessary, and often includes an inner orinasal mask to reduce dead space.

===Breathing hood===
A breathing hood is a type of respiratory interface that completely covers the head and neck, and optionally the shoulders or upper torso, with a loose-fitting bag, which may have a neck seal or be relatively close fitting at the neck or shoulders. They are used in escape breathing apparatus of several kinds (escape hoods), and as a route for supplementary oxygen (oxygen hoods). Breathing hoods with full length visors are commonly used with free-flow supplied air respirators for industrial work like in spray painting, boatbuilding, and woodworking workshops.

===Breathing helmet===
A breathing helmet is usually defined as a rigid respiratory user interface covering the head that also provides head protection against impact and penetration. In medical terminology, a breathing helmet is synonymous with a breathing hood, and need not have any rigid protective structure.

==Ambient pressure regimes==
Breathing apparatus may be used in various pressure regimes: for diving, tunneling, and caisson work, where the ambient atmosphere is unbreathable, or supplemental oxygen is needed for medical reasons, and at high altitudes and in space.

===Hypobaric systems===
High altitude breathing apparatus is used for unpressurised (ambient pressure) aeronautical and mountaineering activities where the oxygen content of the natural atmosphere is insufficient for maintaining physical activity, consciousness, or life, but the atmospheric pressure is sufficient that a pressure suit is not needed.

Both rebreather and open circuit equipment have been used in this application, where either pure oxygen or supplemental oxygen is provided by the equipment. Minor leakage in either direction usually only affects efficiency and gas endurance, as the ambient air is usually only hypoxic due to low ambient pressure.

===Normobaric systems===

Breathing apparatus are used for mine escape and rescue, firefighting, or working in hypoxic or toxic atmospheres at pressures near to normal atmospheric pressure. These may supply breathing gas at a slight overpressure, also known as positive pressure, to prevent contamination by ambient gas, as leakage from the breathing set is generally less harmful than breathing the ambient gas.

This subclass includes both self-contained and airline supplied units, and self-contained units may use rebreather technology to extend gas endurance.

===Hyperbaric systems===
A breathing set intended for use in hyperbaric environments must not supply gas with a toxic concentration of oxygen. Most breathing sets for hyperbaric use are ambient pressure underwater breathing apparatus, but breathing apparatus may be necessary in a pressurised tunnel or caisson due to contamination by hazardous materials. Minor leakage to the environment is usually of little importance.

Open and closed circuit, self-contained, and remotely supplied systems are all in common use, but gas composition choice is complicated by the possibility of oxygen toxicity and decompression requirements. The possibilities of nitrogen narcosis and excessive gas density causing unacceptably high work of breathing make the use of helium as a diluent necessary for use at greater depths. The large range of pressures possible complicate decompression necessary to avoid decompression sickness, and the use of special gas mixtures to accelerate decompression is fairly common. This either requires the diver to use several mixtures at different depths which could be toxic if used at the wrong depth, or for closed circuit apparatus which provides reliable control and monitoring of the gas mixture. As a malfunction which cuts off breathing gas supply to a diver at depth could be rapidly fatal, bailout breathing apparatus may be carried in addition to the primary gas supply.

==Isolation from ambient pressure==
At extremes of ambient pressure, the user must be isolated from the environment to survive, as in single atmosphere diving suits, where the occupant is kept at surface atmospheric pressure, isolated from the high ambient pressure of the deep underwater environment, and pressure suits and space suits where the interior of the suit is pressurised above the external environmental pressure. In these applications it is usual to use oxygen rebreather systems, as they are relatively safe, simple and efficient compared to open circuit, and do not inherently affect suit internal pressure. Liquid air has also been used for space suits, which implies an internal suit pressure close to normal atmospheric pressure, and open circuit. Leakage to or from the outside environment generally indicates a system failure and an emergency.

==Positive and negative pressure systems==
Positive and negative pressure systems can have slightly different meanings in the context of breathing apparatus depending on whether the context is medical or non-medical applications. 

===Occupational health and safety===
In this context these terms refer to the protection of the breathing circuit against leakage of contaminants.

Positive pressure means that the area around the mouth or nose inside the facepiece remains slightly higher than the ambient pressure outside the breathing apparatus facepiece at all times while in use, so that ambient gas or liquid cannot leak into the breathing space. This also has the physiological effect of assisting inhalation and resisting exhalation, but should not affect the total work of breathing.

Negative pressure means that the pressure inside the facepiece is lower than the ambient pressure outside the facepiece at some point during inhalation, and a good seal on the facepiece is required to prevent leakage of the ambient gas or liquid into the breathing space. This pressure offset is usually constant over all or several breaths, depending on the cause, and has the opposite effect of assisting exhalation and resisting inhalation, also with no net effect on the total work of breathing.

===Underwater diving===

The ambient pressure underwater varies with the depth, and diver attitude in the water can affect the variation in pressure between the lungs and the delivered gas in the mouthpiece by up to about 250 mm water (25 mb), but usually less, which can be positive or negative depending on the relative position of the lungs to the demand valve, exhaust valve of a free-flow helmet, or counterlung of a rebreather. Also called and 

===Medical ventilation===

In this context the terms refer to the mechanism of inducing inhalation in a person who is not spontaneously breathing. 

Positive pressure ventilation occurs when the breathing gas is delivered at a pressure higher than ambient, and gas is blown into the respiratory passages, inflating the lungs. This system is used by most mechanical ventilators and resuscitators.

Negative pressure ventilation occurs when the torso of the patient is subjected to an external pressure below ambient pressure, and ambient pressure air is drawn unto the lungs by the pressure difference induced by expansion of the chest. The equipment is traditionally known as an iron lung.

==Applications==
Breathing apparatus may be used to providing gas suitable for breathing in a range of applications where the ambient environment does not provide suitable breathing gas:

===Underwater breathing apparatus===
Underwater breathing apparatus is any breathing apparatus intended to allow the user to breathe underwater, and includes open circuit scuba, diving rebreathers and surface supplied diving equipment, and both ambient pressure and controlled pressure single atmosphere systems.

The major categories of ambient pressure underwater breathing apparatus are:
*Scuba set, any breathing set that is carried entirely by an underwater diver and provides the diver with breathing gas at the ambient pressure:
**Open circuit scuba, where the diver carries the gas supply, and exhaled gas is exhausted to the environment
**Diving rebreathers, where the diver carries the gas supply, and exhaled gas is partly or entirely recycled for further use, and
*Surface supplied diving equipment, where the gas supply is provided from the surface through a hose in a diver&#x27;s umbilical This may be free-flow open circuit, demand open circuit, semi-closed circuit gas extenders, or closed circuit helium reclaim.

Two other types may also be identified:
*Escape sets provide a limited amount of breathing gas to allow the user to reach the surface from a disabled vessel or vehicle, such as a disabled submarine, a sunken armoured vehicle, or a ditched helicopter. These may also be open or closed circuit.
*Atmospheric pressure underwater breathing apparatus is also used, in the form of armoured atmospheric diving suits, which maintain an internal pressure approximating surface pressure. Their breathing apparatus tend to be closed circuit rebreathers.

===Industrial breathing apparatus===

Breathing gas must be supplied for work in unbreathable normobaric atmospheres, which may be toxic, irritant, narcotic or hypoxic, and may include firefighting, damage control, exploration, and rescue work, and in normobaric environments where contamination of the person (hazmat environments) must be avoided. Open circuit and rebreather systems can be used, and self-contained (SCBA) and remotely supplied systems are used depending on the requirement for mobility. Positive or negative pressure equipment may be appropriate, depending on what is to be protected from contamination.

A supplied-air respirator (SAR), also called an airline respirator, is a type of respiratory protection equipment used where the ambient atmosphere is unsuitable to breathe directly or after filtering at the user. The equipment may provide air on demand, at positive pressure, or may supply a constant flow at a rate greater than the user&#x27;s peak demand rate.

Depending on the nature of the hazardous atmosphere, the user may need to wear personal protective equipment to isolate the entire body from the environment (hazmat suit).

===Emergency and escape breathing sets===
Escape breathing apparatus are a class of self contained atmosphere supplying or air purifying breathing apparatus for use in emergencies, intended to allow the user to pass through areas without a breathable atmosphere to a place of relative safety where the ambient air is safe to breathe. These are ambient pressure systems, and include:
*Helicopter escape set
*Mine escape set
*Submarine escape set
*Amphibious Tank Escape Apparatus
*Smoke hood

Early escape sets were often rebreathers and were typically used to escape from submarines that were unable to surface. Escape sets are also used ashore, in the mining industry, and by the military for escape from tanks.

The small open-circuit scuba Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device has the similar purpose of providing breathing gas to escape from a ditched helicopter.

Another type of emergency breathing set, which is remotely supplied, is built-in breathing systems in submarines and hyperbaric chambers.
A &quot;built-in breathing system&quot; is a source of breathing gas installed in a confined space where an alternative to the ambient gas may be required for medical treatment, emergency use, or to minimise a hazard. They are found in diving chambers, hyperbaric treatment chambers, and submarines.

The use in hyperbaric treatment chambers is usually to supply an oxygen rich treatment gas which if used as the chamber atmosphere, would constitute an unacceptable fire hazard. In this application the exhaust gas is vented outside of the chamber. In saturation diving chambers and surface decompression chambers the application is similar, but a further function is a supply of breathable gas in case of toxic contamination of the chamber atmosphere. This function does not require external venting, but the same equipment is typically used for supply of oxygen enriched gases, so they are generally vented to the exterior by default.

In submarines the function is to supply a breathable gas in an emergency, which may be contamination of the ambient internal atmosphere, or flooding. In this application venting to the interior is both acceptable and generally the only feasible option, as the exterior is typically at a higher pressure than the interior, and external venting is not possible by passive means.

The emergency oxygen supplied to passengers in commercial airliners that have lost cabin pressure is also a basic form of built-in breathing system, where the oxygen is generated and supplied as a constant flow for a limited period, which should be sufficient to allow the aircraft to safely descend to an altitude where the ambient air oxygen content is sufficient to support consciousness. These systems vent to the interior.

Smoke hoods and other escape respirators are used in many industrial environments where they may be needed to evacuate a building in a fire or other incident which may compromise the ambient air quality but there is likely to be sufficient oxygen remaining to sustain the necessary activity.

Emergency and escape breathing apparatus may provide purified ambient air where it has sufficient oxygen and it is reasonably practicable to purify it, or may supply stored breathing gas that is known to be respirable.

===Supplemental oxygen provision===

Supplemental oxygen is oxygen additional to that available from atmospheric air at the ambient pressure. This may be necessary or desirable in hypobaric environments, or for medical purposes in any pressure regime. With supplemental oxygen the flow rate is often stipulated, but it is the partial pressure in the alveoli that is important to achieve the desired result, and that is strongly dependent on the delivery system of the breathing apparatus and the ambient pressure. Systems providing a constant flow rate of open circuit oxygen at the nose or mouth will waste a lot of the gas to dead space and during exhalation.

====Oxygen conserving devices====

A closed circuit rebreather is highly effective at conserving stored oxygen, but it makes no use of ambient oxygen, so its effectiveness at minimising use of stored oxygen depends on where it is used. It is most applicable where it is not possible to use enriched ambient gas, either because there is none (underwater and in space), because its pressure is too low (extreme altitude), because it does not contain a useful partial pressure of oxygen, or because the contaminants make the risk unacceptable.

The delivery of open circuit supplemental oxygen is most effective if it is made at a point in the breathing cycle when it will be inhaled to the alveoli, where gas transfer occurs. This is during the first part of inhalation. Oxygen delivered later in the cycle will be inhaled into physiological dead space, where it serves no useful purpose as it cannot diffuse into the blood. Oxygen delivered during stages of the breathing cycle in which it is not inhaled is also wasted, unless it is stored temporarily.

A continuous constant flow rate delivered to the mouth and nose uses a simple regulator, but is inefficient as a high percentage of the delivered gas does not reach the alveoli, and over half is not inhaled at all. A system which accumulates free-flow oxygen during resting and exhalation stages, (reservoir cannulas, partial rebreather masks and non-rebreather masks) makes a larger part of the oxygen available for inhalation, and it will be selectively inhaled during the initial part of inhalation, which reaches furthest into the lungs, and may also recover the volume inhaled into dead space for re-use on the next breath if it can be accommodated by the reservoir bag. The flow rate must be matched to the breathing interface storage volume and the user&#x27;s breathing tidal volume and breathing rate for best efficiency, and the tidal volume and breathing rate can vary considerably over a short period with changes in exertion, so these methods are not very effective for an active user.

Delivery by demand valve avoids wastage of oxygen when the user is not actively inhaling, and when combined with a suitably calibrated dilution orifice can conserve a large proportion of the stored oxygen, but it still wastes oxygen to fill the anatomical and mechanical dead spaces, and it requires some physical effort by the user. 

Since the 1980s, devices have been available which conserve stored oxygen by delivering it during the stage of the breathing cycle when it is more effectively used. This has the effect of stored oxygen lasting longer, or a smaller, and therefore lighter, portable oxygen delivery system being practicable. This class of device can also be used with portable oxygen concentrators, making them more efficient.

A pulse dose oxygen conserving device, (or demand pulse device) senses the start of inhalation and provides a metered bolus, which, if correctly matched to requirements, will be sufficient and effectively inhaled into the alveoli. Such systems can be pneumatically or electrically controlled.

Adaptive demand systems are a development in pulse demand delivery. They are devices that automatically adjust the volume of the pulsed bolus to suit the activity level of the user. This adaptive response is intended to reduce desaturation responses caused by exercise rate variation. The exhaled gas from these devices is discharged to the environment, and the oxygen is lost, so they are less gas-efficient than closed circuit rebreathers, but do not have a carbon dioxide scrubber or counterlungs, which is a saving on weight and bulk, and make use of the oxygen available in the ambient air, so their efficiency is better at lower altitudes.

====High altitude supplemental oxygen====
Mountaineering breathing apparatus provides oxygen at a higher concentration than available from atmospheric air in a naturally hypoxic environment. 
Breathing pure oxygen results in an elevated partial pressure of oxygen in the blood: a climber breathing pure oxygen at the summit of Mt. Everest has a greater arterial oxygen partial pressure than breathing air at sea level. This results in being able to exert greater physical effort at altitude. The equipment must be lightweight and reliable in severe cold, including not getting choked with deposited frost from the exhaled gas, which is saturated with water vapour at body temperature. 

For mountaineering at high altitudes where the user has to carry the stored oxygen, it is desirable to maximise endurance of the set by efficient use of the gas. The theoretically available delivery systems are: a constant flow system without reservoir, which is simple and reliable, but extremely wasteful, a constant flow system with reservoir, which when matched to the user demand is more efficient than simple constant flow, and is also relatively simple and reliable, a demand valve system, which automatically follows user demand, but also wastes a significant part of inhaled gas on dead space, a pulse dose demand system, which wastes less gas on dead space, but relies on a relatively complex control system which introduces reliability issues, or a closed circuit system, which is very efficient, but requires a carbon dioxide scrubber. The exothermic carbon dioxide absorption reaction of a rebreather helps keep the scrubber contents from freezing while it is in use, and helps reduce heat loss from the user, but it is bulky and heavy, and is sensitive to freezing when not in constant use. Both chemically generated and compressed gas oxygen have been used in experimental closed-circuit oxygen mountaineering systems, but open circuit constant flow using a reservoir mask has usually been used in the field, although relatively wasteful, as the equipment is reliable.

Although there is considerable similarity in the basic conditions in which aviation and mountaineering breathing apparatus is used, there are differences sufficient to make directly transferable use of equipment generally impracticable. One of the major considerations is that, unlike the aviator, the mountaineer cannot quickly descend to a safe altitude if the equipment fails, so it must be reliable. Another is that the mountaineer must personally carry the breathing apparatus, so the advantage gained by breathing supplemental oxygen must exceed the disadvantage of carrying the extra bulk and weight of the equipment. Other requirements are that the added work of breathing must be low, the equipment must function at low temperatures, and conservation of heat and moisture are desirable. The altitude range for mountaineering is also limited, there are no requirements for pressurisation.

====Oxygen therapy====

Oxygen therapy is the use of supplemental oxygen as medical therapy. Acute indications for therapy include hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), carbon monoxide toxicity, cluster headache and decompression illness. It may also be prophylactically given to maintain blood oxygen levels during the induction of anesthesia. Oxygen therapy is often useful in chronic hypoxemia caused by conditions such as severe COPD or cystic fibrosis. Partial pressures administered range from low flow rates giving slight increases over ambient air up to 2.8 bar absolute used in hyperbaric oxygen treatment of decompression illness and some other indications. Oxygen can be delivered to spontaneously breathing patients via nasal cannula, face mask, artificial airway, or by built-in breathing system demand mask or oxygen hood in a hyperbaric chamber. Delivery may be by continuous flow, by bag reservoir mask, on demand, or on pulse demand.

Patients who are not able to breathe sufficiently for themselves are provided with breathing gas by ventilator or resuscitator.

===Medical breathing apparatus===
An &quot;anaesthetic machine&quot; (British English) or &quot;anesthesia machine&quot; (American English) is a medical device used to generate and mix a fresh gas flow of medical gases and inhalational anaesthetic agents for the purpose of inducing and maintaining anaesthesia.

====Anaesthetic machines====
The anaesthetic machine is commonly used together with a mechanical ventilator, breathing system, suction equipment, and patient monitoring devices; strictly speaking, the term &quot;anaesthetic machine&quot; refers only to the component which generates the gas flow, but modern machines usually integrate all these devices into one combined freestanding unit, which is colloquially referred to as the anaesthetic machine for the sake of simplicity. In the developed world, the most frequent type in use is the &quot;continuous-flow anaesthetic machine&quot;, which is designed to provide a supply of medical gases mixed with an accurate concentration of anaesthetic vapour, and to deliver this continuously to the patient at a safe pressure and flow. This is distinct from &quot;intermittent-flow anaesthetic machines&quot;, which provide gas flow only on demand when triggered by the patient&#x27;s own inspiration.

====Mechanical ventilators and resuscitators====
Mechanical ventilation is the provision of breathing gas to the user by the ventilator or resuscitator, when the user is unable to provide the driving forces to induce gas flow. Such artificial ventilation is a characteristic of resuscitation and may be provided by medical ventilators when needed. Two basic types of mechanical ventilation may be distinguished by the limiting mechanism. Some are pressure controlled, in which the delivery stops when a limiting pressure is reached, and others are volume controlled, in which a set volume is delivered for each breath. Both of these methods have limitations and may work sub-optimally in some circumstances.

A &quot;ventilator&quot; is a type of equipment that provides mechanical ventilation by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs, to deliver breaths to a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently. Ventilators are computerized microprocessor-controlled machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated bag valve mask. Ventilators are chiefly used in intensive-care medicine, home care, and emergency medicine (as standalone units) and in anesthesiology (as a component of an anesthesia machine).

A &quot;resuscitator&quot; is a device using positive pressure to inflate the lungs of an unconscious person who is not breathing, in order to keep them oxygenated and alive.

There is considerable overlap between &quot;ventilator&quot; and &quot;resuscitator&quot;. The difference may mainly be in the way the equipment is used.

There are three modes of mechanical ventilation, which are the ways in which a breath is delivered by a medical ventilator: In control mode, each breath is mechanically delivered, but may be triggered by a timing mechanism or by patient effort. These breaths may be volume or pressure controlled. In supported or spontaneous mode, each breath is triggered by the patient, and supported by ventilator. In combination mode, there is a combination of controlled and supported breaths, and there may be a combination of volume controlled and pressure supported or controlled breaths.

===High altitude breathing apparatus===

High altitude breathing apparatus is used in aviation as standard equipment in unpressurised aircraft capable of high altitude flight, as emergency equipment in unpressurised aircraft, and in high altitude mountaineering.

====Environmental influence====
At &quot;high altitude&quot;, from there are physiological effects of the reduced oxygen partial pressure which include reduced exercise performance and increased respiratory rate. Arterial oxygen saturation is generally still over 90% in healthy people, but arterial PO2 is reduced. 

At &quot;very high altitude&quot;, from arterial oxygen saturation falls below 90% and arterial PO2 is reduced to the extent that extreme hypoxemia may occur during exercise and sleep, and if high altitude pulmonary edema occurs. In this range severe altitude illness is common.

At &quot;extreme altitude&quot;, above , one can expect significant hypoxemia, hypocapnia and alkalosis, with progressive deterioration of physiological function, which exceeds acclimatisation. Consequently, there is no human habitation in this altitude range.

====Physiological effects====

In the region from sea level to around , known as the &quot;physiological-efficient zone&quot;, oxygen levels are usually high enough for humans to function without supplemental oxygen and altitude decompression sickness is rare.

The &quot;physiological-deficient&quot; zone extends from to about . In this zone there is an increased risk of hypoxia, trapped-gas dysbarism (where gas trapped in the body expands), and evolved-gas dysbarism (where dissolved gases such as nitrogen may form in the tissues, i.e. decompression sickness). Above approximately oxygen-rich breathing mixture is required to approximate the oxygen available in the lower atmosphere, while above oxygen must be provided under positive pressure. Above , respiration is not possible because the pressure at which the lungs excrete carbon dioxide (approximately 87 mmHg) exceeds outside air pressure. Above , known as the Armstrong limit, exposed fluids in the throat and lungs will boil away at normal body temperature, and pressure suits are needed. Generally, 100% oxygen is used to maintain an equivalent altitude of .

====Physiogical acclimatisation====

People can become acclimatised to an altitude of if they remain at high altitude for long enough, but for high altitude rescue work, rescue teams must be rapidly deployed, and the time necessary to acclimatise is not available, making oxygen breathing equipment necessary above approximately .

====Theoretical solutions====
An oxygen partial pressure equivalent to sea level can be maintained at an altitude of with 100% oxygen. Above , positive pressure breathing with 100% oxygen is essential, as without positive pressure even very short exposures to altitudes above lead to loss of consciousness. Oxygen conservation devices may be used with open circuit breathing apparatus to improve efficiency of gas use at lower altitudes where ambient pressure breathing is viable.

====Management====
At high enough altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen in the air is insufficient to support useful work and consciousness, even after acclimatisation, and at even higher altitudes it cannot support human life. At altitudes where the problem is hypoxia, breathing gas with a higher oxygen content at ambient pressure is a viable solution. Supplemental oxygen sufficient to provide an equivalent altitude of a pressurised aircraft cabin (about 8000ft) is sufficient for many purposes, but higher concentrations, such as sea level equivalent (PO2 of about 0.21 bar), can allow a greater capacity for aerobic work. Balanced against this is the need to conserve oxygen and to minimise the weight carried by the user of breathing apparatus. 

====Practical aspects====
Where the user must carry the supplementary oxygen supply, and also perform significant work over a fairly long period, as in mountaineering and rescue work, the efficiency of oxygen use and the reliability of the breathing apparatus are more important, and there is a trade-off of these characteristics with the weight that must be carried.

The amount of supplementary oxygen needed to bring the inhaled partial pressure to sea level equivalent, or any other fixed value greater than that of the ambient atmosphere is a function of the altitude, and increases with an increase in altitude in direct proportion to pressure drop. The amount of supplementary oxygen actually used is also proportional to respiratory minute volume, which depends on the level of exertion. 

====Oxygen concentrators====

When there is no limitation on power use and the work is to be done at a fixed location, oxygen concentrators may be an effective solution. An oxygen concentrator is a device that concentrates the oxygen from a gas supply (typically ambient air) by selectively removing nitrogen to supply an oxygen-enriched product gas stream. They are also used industrially and as medical devices for oxygen therapy. Two methods in common use are pressure swing adsorption and membrane gas separation. They are most efficient when the supplemental oxygen does not need to be at a high percentage.

Pressure swing adsorption oxygen concentrators use a molecular sieve to adsorb gases and operate on the principle of rapid pressure swing adsorption of atmospheric nitrogen onto zeolite minerals at high pressure. This type of adsorption system is therefore functionally a nitrogen scrubber, leaving the other atmospheric gases to pass through, with oxygen as the primary gas remaining. Gas separation across a membrane is also a pressure-driven process, where the driving force is the difference in pressure between inlet of raw material and outlet of product. The membrane used in the process is a generally non-porous layer, so there will not be a severe leakage of gas through the membrane. The performance of the membrane depends on permeability and selectivity. Permeability is affected by the penetrant size. Larger gas molecules have a lower diffusion coefficient. The membrane gas separation equipment typically pumps gas into the membrane module and the targeted gases are separated based on difference in diffusivity and solubility. Product gas can be delivered directly to the user through a suitable breathing apparatus.

Pulse dose (also called intermittent-flow or on-demand) portable oxygen concentrators are the smallest units, which may weigh as little as Their small size enables the user to waste less of the energy gained from the treatment on carrying them. The unit administers a set volume (bolus) of oxygen enriched air at the start of each breath, which is the part of the breath most likely to reach the gas exchange regions of the lung beyond the physiological dead space. Their ability to make efficient use of oxygen is key to keeping the units compact.

====Closed circuit oxygen rebreathers====

In a closed circuit system, any unused oxygen is retained and rebreathed, so the utilisation is close to 100%, with some losses possible due to expansion on increased altitude and incidental leakage from the breathing loop. 

There is a risk of pulmonary oxygen toxicity if the pressure of the oxygen exceeds about 0.5 bar for extended periods, which could happen at altitudes below 5500 m, where atmospheric pressure is about half of the value at sea level.

A closed circuit oxygen rebreather is the most efficient in terms of oxygen use, but is relatively bulky and requires the use of a carbon dioxide absorbent, which must either be sufficient for the oxygen supply, or must be periodically replaced. If the oxygen supply fails, the loop gas can become more hypoxic than ambient atmosphere if the loop was not adequately purged or if it gets contaminated by ambient air. In the absence of oxygen monitoring the user may not notice the reduction in oxygen concentration.

A closed-circuit oxygen system was tested by Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans during the 1953 British expedition to Mount Everest.

====Open circuit dilutor demand regulator====
The dilutor demand regulator was developed and extensively used for high altitude flying during WWII. A dilutor demand regulator draws ambient air into the mask through an orifice in the regulator, while concurrently being fed with pure oxygen through a demand valve in the regulator. For aeronautical use the size of the ambient air orifice is controlled by an aneroid valve operator and is directly proportional to atmospheric pressure. As the altitude increases, the pressure decreases and the orifice gets smaller, so the user is provided with a higher proportion of oxygen, and when correctly calibrated, the partial pressure of oxygen in the mixture remains fairly consistent at a value similar to the 0.21 bar at sea level. This system makes efficient use of a combination of ambient and stored oxygen. 
The function of the aneroid valve operator can be substituted for terrestrial use by a simpler, lighter, and more rugged manually operated orifice selector knob, giving a stepwise range of concentrations which is lighter, more reliable, a bit less efficient, and requires appropriate selection by the user. It also allows the user to manually adjust the mixture to match personal needs. As it is manually selected, It is less suitable for flying, and more suitable for pedestrians who will not change altitude rapidly.
The flow rates through the orifice and regulator are sensitive to flow rate of inhalation, and can be designed to provide a somewhat higher oxygen partial pressure at higher inhalation flow rates, which helps compensate for higher exertion.

====Obligatory pressurisation zone====
This is the zone where 100% oxygen at ambient pressure is insufficient, and some form of pressurisation is required to provide a viable inhalation oxygen pressure. The options are partial pressurisation and full pressurisation.

A pressure suit is a protective suit worn by high-altitude pilots who may fly at altitudes where the air pressure is too low for an unprotected person to survive, even breathing pure oxygen at positive pressure. Such suits may be either full-pressure (e.g., a space suit) or partial-pressure (as used by aircrew). Partial-pressure suits work by providing mechanical counter-pressure to assist breathing at altitude.

A space suit is a garment worn to keep a human alive in the harsh environment of outer space, primarily as protection from vacuum and temperature extremes. The breathing gas is pure oxygen, which allows the lowest suit pressure. Space suits are often worn inside spacecraft as a safety precaution in case of loss of cabin pressure, and are essential for extravehicular activity (EVA). Modern space suits augment the basic pressure garment with a complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable, and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs, resisting a soft pressure garment&#x27;s natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum. A self-contained oxygen supply and environmental control system may be used to allow greater freedom of movement, independent of the spacecraft.

Three types of space suits exist for different purposes: IVA (intravehicular activity), EVA (extravehicular activity), and IEVA (intra/extravehicular activity). IVA suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft, and are therefore lighter and more comfortable. IEVA suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft, such as the Gemini G4C suit. They include more protection from the harsh conditions of space, such as protection from micrometeoroids and extreme temperature change. EVA suits, such as the EMU, are used outside spacecraft, for either planetary exploration or spacewalks. They must protect the wearer against all conditions of space, as well as provide mobility and functionality.

==Safety==
Breathing apparatus is usually used as personal protective equipment, and the user should be safer using it than without it in the same environment if it is needed, but there are hazards associated with its use. Some are specific to the apparatus and others are more general. The more obvious generic hazards are loss of gas supply, contamination of gas supply, and inappropriate gas supply. The consequences may include hypoxia, hyperoxia, hypercapnia, and poisoning or infection by contamination of the breathing gas due to leaks. Where high oxygen concentrations are provided, there may be a fire hazard, where high pressure gas storage is used, there are hazards associated with the high pressure equipment, and where liquid oxygen is used there are hazards of extreme cold.

The usual methods of risk management include design standards, quality control during manufacture, testing and certification of equipment, appropriate training of operators, regulation of use, as appropriate to the specific equipment and situations in which it is used, and correct selection of equipment for the situation. For some equipment, proper maintenance and pre-use inspection and testing are required.

==Physiological effects of use==

Breathing apparatus of several types may affect the physical work capacity of the wearer if they cause additional breathing resistance or dead space ad by the weight that must be carried. The effects are changes to breathing patterns, hypoventilation, and the associated carbon dioxide retention due to increases in the work of breathing. These effects are more apparent during heavy physical work, and maximum work capacity is reduced.

==Human factors in breathing apparatus design==

Human factors in breathing apparatus design are the influence of the interaction between the user and the equipment on the design of the equipment. The user of breathing apparatus relies on the equipment to stay alive or healthy, in reasonable comfort and to perform the tasks required during use of the equipment. The design of the equipment can strongly influence its effectiveness in performing the desired functions. It should be comfortable to wear, and not cause stress injury or allergic reactions to component materials. It must be reliable and should not require constant attention or adjustment during use, and if possible performance should degrade gradually in the event of malfunctions, allowing time for corrective action to be taken with minimum risk. It should not excessively burden the user by its weight or reduce work capacity unnecessarily by dead space, increased work of breathing or obstruction of vision.

Users vary considerably in anthropometric dimensions, physical strength, stamina, joint flexibility, etc. Breathing apparatus should allow as full a range of physical function as reasonably practicable and should be matched to the user, the environment and the task. The interface between equipment and user can strongly influence functionality. Breathing apparatus may be used by a wide range of users and must work for them all. Where correct operation and use of equipment is critical to user safety, it is desirable that different makes and models for the same application should work similarly, to facilitate rapid familiarisation with new equipment. Where this is not possible, additional training for the required skills may be necessary, and for medical interventions it may be necessary for a skilled operator to set up the apparatus and monitor its function while in use.

The user of breathing apparatus may be supported by a team who are available to assist to the extent necessary to reduce the risk associated with the use of the apparatus to a level acceptable in terms of the governing regulations and codes of practice. 

Breathing apparatus is used to facilitate breathing in hazardous conditions or where the user needs assistance to respire adequately. The primary requirements are to keep the user alive and healthy during and after use. Secondary requirements include providing user comfort, and sufficient capacity to perform the intended activities. The user is an integral part of the system, which may rely on user competence as well as correct equipment function for safe operation.

Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. If its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure, as compared to a naively designed system, in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown. Fault tolerance is particularly important in high availability or safety-critical systems. The ability to maintain functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as &#x27;graceful degradation&#x27;. Some items of breathing apparatus, and the user, may be regarded as safety critical components of the system, and should therefore be tolerant of faults. In the case of the user, this is achieved by sufficient fitness to perform the intended task, competence, and situational awareness. Equipment must be selected which is appropriate for the specific use, and can be designed, manufactured, and maintained to provide appropriate fault tolerance. Good ergonomic design minimises the opportunity for user error.

===Work of breathing===
Breathing apparatus must allow the user to breathe with minimum added work of breathing, and minimise additional dead space.

Work of breathing (WOB) is the energy expended to inhale and exhale a breathing gas. It is usually expressed as work per unit volume, for example, joules/litre, or as a work rate (power), such as joules/min or equivalent units, as it is not particularly useful without a reference to volume or time. It can be calculated in terms of the pulmonary pressure multiplied by the change in pulmonary volume, or in terms of the oxygen consumption attributable to breathing.

The total work of breathing when using a breathing apparatus is the sum of the physiological work of breathing and the mechanical work of breathing of the apparatus.
In a normal resting state the physiological work of breathing constitutes about 5% of the total body oxygen consumption. It can increase considerably due to illness or constraints on gas flow imposed by breathing apparatus, ambient pressure, or breathing gas composition.

===Breathing mask construction===
 
Breathing masks and diving helmets both provide a supply of breathing gas to the user. Other functions may differ or partly overlap.

==== Seal ====
If the mask is intended to be used in a hostile environment and contamination of the gas supply must be prevented, the mask must form an airtight or watertight seal around the edges, regardless of the position of the user. This seal is between the elastomer skirt of the mask and the skin of the face. Fit of mask affects the seal and comfort and must account for variability of face shapes and sizes. This is less of a problem with full-face masks and less again with diving helmets, but other problems affect these, like overall head size, and neck length and circumference, so there is still a need for adjustment and a few size options.

Seals may be compromised by hair passing under the seal, and the amount of leakage will depend on the amount of hair and in some cases, the position of the compromised part of the seal.

==== Ear clearing ====

The gas space in a breathing mask is inherently self-equalising for reasonably gradual pressure changes. If the mask is to be used where the ambient pressure may change significantly, the user must be able to equalise the pressure in the middle ears, which for many people requires a method to block the nostrils.

Diving helmets and most full-face masks do not allow the user finger access to the nose, and various mechanical aids have been tried with varying levels of comfort and convenience. Masks for supplemental oxygen may be soft enough to close the nose with the mask in place, or may be temporarily removed. Masks for use in contaminated atmospheres are usually used at a constant ambient pressure, so this problem may not arise.

==== Vision ====
The field of vision of the user of a full-face breathing mask or helmet is reduced by opaque parts of the helmet or mask. Peripheral vision can be particularly reduced in the lower areas due to the bulk of the demand valve. Helmet design is a compromise between low mass and inertia, with relatively small interior volume and viewports affording restricted field of vision, and large viewports with large interior volume. Siting the viewport close to the eyes helps provide a better view but is complicated by the need for sufficient clearance in front of the nose for a wide range of divers. Cylindrically curved viewports can introduce visual distortions underwater that can reduce the effectiveness of the diver at judging distance, but are common in masks used in air. Spherical viewport surfaces are generally used in recent atmospheric suits for structural reasons, and work well when the interior volume is large enough. They can be made wide enough for adequate peripheral vision. Field of vision in helmets is affected by mobility of the helmet. A helmet directly supported by the head can rotate with the head, allowing the user to aim the viewport at the target, but peripheral vision is constrained by the dimensions of the viewport. The weight in air and unbalanced buoyancy forces when immersed must be carried by the neck, and inertial and hydrodynamic loads must be carried by the neck. A helmet fixed to a breastplate or space suit is supported by the torso, which can safely support much greater loads, but it does not rotate with the head. The entire upper body must rotate to direct the field of vision. This makes it necessary to use larger viewports so the user has an acceptable field of vision at times when rotating the body is impractical. The need to rotate the head inside the non-rotatable helmet requires internal clearance, therefore a large volume.

The inside surface of the viewport of a mask or helmet tends to be prone to fogging when the external environment is colder than the dew pint of the gas inside, where tiny droplets of condensed water disperse light passing through the transparent material, blurring the view. Treating the inside surface with a defogging surfactant can reduce fogging, but it may occur anyway, and it must be possible to actively defog, either by rinsing with water or by blowing dry air over it until it is clear. A spitcock may be provided on standard helmets for rinsing. Demand helmets may have a free-flow supply valve which directs dry air over the inside of the facepiece. Full-face diving masks may use either rinsing or free-flow, depending on whether they are intended primarily for scuba or surface-supply. Full-face masks and helmets may also direct the flow of fresh dry gas over the inside surface of the viewport before it is inhaled, and prevent warm, moist exhaled gas from reaching the faceplate by using an oro-nasal insert with a non-return valve in the exhaust flow path. In situations where rinsing is not an option, an anti-fogging surfactant can be applied to the viewport surface to prevent the formation of droplets. A manually operated wiper blade has also occasionally been used for removing condensation from the viewport. 
Users who need optical correction have choices. Contact lenses can be worn under all types of masks and helmets. Regular spectacles can be worn in most helmets, but can not be adjusted. Corrective lenses can be fitted to the inside of some full-face masks, but the distance from the eyes to the lenses may not be optimal. Bifocal arrangements are available. Defogging of bonded lenses is the same as for plain glass.
Open circuit breathing apparatus for diving produces exhalation gas bubbles at the exhaust ports. Free-flow systems produce the largest volumes, but the outlet can be behind the viewports so it does not obscure the diver&#x27;s vision. Demand systems must have the second stage diaphragm and exhaust ports at approximately the same depth as the mouth or lungs to minimise work of breathing. To get consistent breathing effort for the range of postures the diver may need to assume, this is most practicable when the exhaust ports and valves are close to the mouth, so some form of ducting is required to direct the bubbles away from the viewports of helmet or mask. This generally diverts exhaust gases round the sides of the head, where they tend to be rather noisy as the bubbles rise past the ears. Closed circuit systems vent far less gas, which can be released behind the diver, and are significantly quieter. Diffuser systems have been tried, but have not been successful for open circuit equipment, though they have been used on rebreathers, where they improve stealth characteristics.

==== Security ====
Masks held in place by adjustable straps can be knocked off or moved from the correct position, allowing ambient atmosphere or water to flood in, and the loss of breathing gas. Full-face breathing masks are more easily dislodged due to their size, and need to be more securely supported, usually by 4 or 5 adjustable straps, connected at the back of the head, but it is possible for them to be dislodged, so it must be possible for the user to refit them and purge the mask sufficiently to continue breathing. Helmets are much more securely attached, and it is considered an emergency if they come off the head.

==== Internal volume ====
The volume of dead space is important for all breathing apparatus. Internal oro-nasal masks are often used to minimise internal dead space in helmets and full-face masks, and may also reduce the tendency to fog the inner surface of the viewport.

==== Helmet buoyancy ====

A lightweight demand diving helmet is ballasted to be nearly neutrally buoyant underwater so it is not an excessive static load on the neck.

Free-flow diving helmets compensate for a potentially large dead space by a high gas flow rate, so that exhaled gas is flushed away before it can be rebreathed. They tend to have a large internal volume, and be heavier than demand helmets, and usually rest on the shoulders to prevent over-stressing the neck, so do not move with the head. Underwater, excess buoyancy is counteracted by connection to the diver&#x27;s weighting system or by s.

====SCBA harness====
When the user must carry the gas supply, weight, balance and inertia of the apparatus and the load distribution of the harness can make a large difference to comfort and safety, particularly when the user may be required to do heavy work in difficult conditions, as in firefighting, rescue and mountain climbing. The user must have as much freedom of movement as is reasonably practicable, and at least enough to safely carry out the expected tasks&#x27; while the set must remain securely in place during the necessary maneuvers. Access to the valves and pressure gauge is important for gas management, and it is helpful when equipment is shared by a team that the fit can be easily and quickly adjusted to suit the individual.
For diving the buoyancy and buoyancy distribution are important to safety.

===Gas management===
For supplied gas breathing apparatus, it is usually highly undesirable, and may well be an emergency, to run out of gas unexpectedly. Monitoring remaining gas, identifying low gas levels in time to take appropriate action, and where necessary, bailing out to an available backup system are necessary items of gas management.

====Gas endurance====
The most fundamental aspect of gas management is to have a realistic idea of the expected endurance of the currently available gas, and how this will be affected by exertion in foreseeable circumstances.
Periodical checks on the remaining gas pressure is the usual monitoring method, for which the usual equipment is a cylinder pressure gauge attached to the regulator first stage. When the user is likely to be task loaded to the extent that failing to check gas pressure is reasonably likely, a low gas alarm, a manual reserve switchover, or both are prudent. All three of these may be found on industrial breathing sets used for rescue and firefighting. For underwater diving, pressure gauges are standard, with an alternative gas supply system selected from a contextually acceptable option of scuba bailout set, gas supplied by a buddy diver, or emergency ascent to the surface. The choice depends on the risk assessment, and in some cases standard operating procedures or code of practice. Reserve valves are also occasionally still used in low visibility conditions. The buddy system and emergency ascents are frequently used by recreational divers in shallow open water with no planned decompression obligation. Occupational divers may be obliged to carry an independent bailout set, and technical divers may have several contingency plans for the reasonably foreseeable situations that could occur that would compromise their breathing gas supply.

When more than one breathing gas mixture is available, the risk of selecting a gas unsuitable for the current situation must be minimised.

In medical equipment, the user interface of the control and monitoring system can influence the probability of operator error.

===Rebreather endurance===

The endurance of a rebreather or life support system providing gas to a breathing apparatus is also dependent on its ability to remove carbon dioxide from the exhaled gas. This is known as scrubber endurance.

<text>Children&#x27;s Laureate, now known as the Waterstones Children&#x27;s Laureate, is a position awarded in the United Kingdom once every two years to a &quot;writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books to celebrate outstanding achievement in their field.&quot; The role promotes the importance of children&#x27;s literature, reading, creativity and storytelling while promoting the right of every child to enjoy a lifetime of books and stories. Each Laureate uses their tenure to focus on an aspect of children&#x27;s books – these have included poetry, storytelling, readers with disabilities and illustration. 

The aim of the Waterstones Children&#x27;s Laureateship is to celebrate and promote creativity and storytelling, and to inspire all children to read a rich and diverse range of stories. The Laureateship also promotes the importance of children&#x27;s books, reading and champions the right of every child to enjoy a life rich in books and stories. The post stemmed from a discussion between the poet laureate Ted Hughes and children&#x27;s writer Michael Morpurgo. The Waterstones Children&#x27;s Laureate receives a £30,000 bursary and an inscribed silver medal.

The main sponsor of the Waterstones Children&#x27;s Laureate is Waterstones, with additional funding from Arts Council England and support from children&#x27;s publishers. A selection panel considers nominations from a range of organisations representing librarians and sellers, including the International Board on Books for Young People. The Waterstones Children&#x27;s Laureate is managed by BookTrust, who supports the Laureate and organise events.

The post is currently held by Frank Cottrell-Boyce.

<doc id="1265618" wikidata="Q4382515" url="?curid=1265618" title="Marcela Acuña">
<text>Marcela Eliana Acuña (born 16 October 1976) is an Argentine professional boxer and part-time politician. She has held multiple super bantamweight world titles, including the IBF title since 2018; the WBA title from 2006 to 2008; the WBC title twice between 2008 and 2010; the WBO title from 2013 to 2014; the IBF title from 2016 to 2018; and the WBA interim featherweight title in 2016.

==Early life==
Acuña enjoyed boxing from a very early age. At the age of seven, she visited a boxing gym for the first time. Her first trainer, Ramon Chaparro, would many years later become her husband.

Marcela Acuña became an accomplished martial arts fighter before she decided to box for money. At the age of twelve, she had earned a black belt and she became South America&#x27;s champion in her division by the age of fourteen. She made sixteen successful title defenses.

She had to retire from karate due to pregnancy. In 1995, she and Chaparro had their first son. After some time away from combat sports, Acuña decided that she would return, only this time, she would compete in boxing.

==Professional boxing career==
Acuña made her professional debut on 5 December 1997 against Christy Martin in Pompano Beach, Florida, on an undercard that was headlined by Johnny Tapia&#x27;s world championship defense against Puerto Rico&#x27;s Andy Agosto and which was shown nationally across the United States. Acuña was dropped in round ten, but she rose and finished the bout on her feet. Despite losing a unanimous decision by scores of 100-90 and 99-90 (twice), Acuña&#x27;s performance was hailed by many fans and critics alike, considering that this was her first professional boxing bout.

In just her second professional fight she met Lucia Rijker on 25 September 1998, at Ledyard, Connecticut, for the vacant IBO super lightweight title. Acuña was knocked out in five rounds.

After losing her first two fights, Acuña stepped away from boxing.

===Return to boxing===

Acuña returned to boxing in 2001, and she and her rival, Jamillia Lawrence of New Jersey, made Argentine boxing history when they participated in the first ever women&#x27;s boxing fight to be sanctioned by the Argentine boxing commission. Acuña got her first win, with a four-round split decision over the American at Buenos Aires, on 12 February of that year.

On 1 June, she obtained a six-round unanimous decision win over Luz Marina Sanabria Ledesma of Colombia, at Formosa.

Twenty eight days later, she got her first knockout win, when she defeated Uruguay&#x27;s Andrea Pereyra in only two rounds.

On 11 August, she returned to Buenos Aires, to defeat Yolanda Marrugo, dropping her twice, on her way to a six-round unanimous decision.

On September 21, she fought at Carlos Monzón&#x27;s birthplace, Santa Fe, when she was rematched with Pereyra. Acuña knocked out Pereyra in five rounds, and Pereyra required hospitalization after this fight. Acuña was awarded the &quot;La Opinion&#x27;s 80th anniversary&quot; trophy that night.

On 12 October she knocked out Ana Dos Santos in two rounds, for her last appearance of 2001.

Her first fight of 2002 was preceded by much media hype. She was challenged by famous fitness instructor Patricia Quirico, who herself was making her professional debut when she boxed Acuña.

If for nothing else, the fight was widely expected because Quirico was a well known personality with developed body strength, who helped fan interest for the fight develop when she began to threaten Acuña through the media. Although she was 40 years old already, she seemed to feel an authentic dislike towards Acuña, and fans across Argentina spoke about the fight on the weeks prior to the event. The fact Quirico had participated in twenty three exhibition matches, as well as in karate and baseball also helped fan interest grow.

They met on 19 January 2002, at Buenos Aires. Acuña scored one of the quickest knockouts in boxing history, when she landed a right to Quirico&#x27;s chin right after the first bell rang, and followed it with a left that sent Quirico to the floor. Quirico was counted out and Acuña officially won the fight at fourteen seconds of round one. The win earned her the Argentine Featherweight title.

On 1 March she had to fight one of her closest friends, Carmen Montiel, to defend her Argentina title. Acuña outpointed Montiel over ten rounds.

Next, she would have had her second world title try, on 6 April against Panama&#x27;s Damaris Pinock Ortega, for the vacant WIBA title. The 2002 Argentine economic crisis, however, forced for the fight to be postponed.

On 29 June she and Montiel had a rematch, and Acuña again prevailed, by an eight-round unanimous decision.

===World championships===
Acuña then lost weight, going down all the way to the Super Bantamweight division to get her second try at becoming a world champion. In what was the first ever women&#x27;s boxing world championship fight to be staged in Argentina, Acuña lost a split decision to champion Alicia Ashley.

Acuña then decided to take another two-year lay-off, but she had also decided to stay around the Super Bantamweight division&#x27;s weight limit, because she wanted to fight in that division from there on. And when she returned for the second time, on 21 February 2003, she knocked out former Regina Halmich challenger Lourdes Gonzalez in two rounds to win the Argentine Super Bantamweight title.

On 10 May she fought in a place where boxing matches are rare: Tierra del Fuego, where she knocked out Ana Davila Ferreira in two rounds.

Then came a rematch with Ashley. On her third world title try, Acuña lost to Ashley for the second time, this time by a ten-round unanimous decision, on 14 June.

On 22 August she and her friend Carmen Montiel met for the third time, and Acuña again beat Montiel on points, this time in six rounds. This victory set up the stage for Acuña&#x27;s fourth world title try.

On 6 December, she and Panamanian Pinock Ortega finally got to meet, and Acuña became world champion when she knocked out Ortega in the sixth round for the vacant WIBA Super Bantamweight title.

On 26 May 2004, she made her first world championship defense, knocking out Daysi Padilla in the first round. Padilla, who had former world champion Ricardo Cardona at her corner, also required a short stay at a hospital.

On 11 September 2004, Acuña knocked out Ana Camilla Santos in the third round of a non-title bout.

On 22 January 2005, she knocked out Maria Elena Miranda in three rounds to win the WIBA&#x27;s vacant world Featherweight title, at Formosa.

In May 2019 she fought former world champion Jackie Nava to a draw.

In October 2023 she lost to former world champion Sarah Mahfoud, via unanimous decision.

==Professional boxing record==

==Politics==
In 2009 she was fourth on the Peronist list running for city council in Tres de Febrero Partido.

<text>Into the Sun is the debut studio album by musician Sean Lennon. It was released by the Beastie Boys&#x27; label Grand Royal (distributed by Capitol Records, a division of EMI which had been the longtime home of Sean&#x27;s father John Lennon) on May 8, 1998, in Japan and on May 19, 1998, in the United States.

== Background ==

&quot;Into the Sun&quot; was recorded during Lennon&#x27;s time performing with Timo Ellis alongside Yuka Honda, who was Lennon&#x27;s girlfriend at the time and also produced and performed on the album. Lennon has said it was &quot;inspired by my girlfriend&quot;. &quot;Into the Sun&quot; was recorded at Sear Sound in New York, with the exception of the track &quot;Queue&quot;, which was recorded at another New York studio, The Magic Shop. The album was engineered and mixed by Tom Schick at Sear Sound and mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering Studios.

A voice on the final track, &quot;Sean&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which softly speaks &quot;Goodnight, Sean&quot;, is sometimes mistakenly attributed to father John Lennon; however, it is, in fact, that of Walter Sear, an owner of Sear Sound. Sean has said it is in tribute to his father, whose tribute to Sean, &quot;Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)&quot; closes with &quot;Goodnight, Sean. See you in the morning, bright and early.&quot;

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;Lennon displays a fine grasp of pop conventions and delivers shimmering examples with the bossa nova-flavored title track and the breezy summer companion &#x27;Two Fine Lovers&#x27;.&quot;

*&quot;The Hork-Bajir Chronicles&quot; (1966, 1968–69, 1998)
**Although the events in this story occur between &quot;The Ellimist Chronicles&quot; and &quot;The Andalite Chronicles&quot;, the entire story is being told by Jara Hamee to Tobias after book #13, &quot;The Change&quot;, and before the events of #23 &quot;The Pretender&quot;. Tobias makes reference to his restlessness and the fact that there were no missions planned (Prologue, pg ix). However, in &quot;The Pretender&quot;, (pg 12) Tobias makes reference to the fact that they had &quot;worked plenty lately, dealing with the horrifying matter of David, the first new Animorph.&quot; This places the last possible &quot;break&quot; before book #20, the first book in the David trilogy

*&quot;32: The Separation&quot;—({{circa|1999}})
*&quot;33: The Illusion&quot;
*&quot;34: The Prophecy&quot;
*&quot;35: The Proposal&quot;
*&quot;Visser&quot; (1976, 1980s, 1991–1999)
**The trial chronicled in &quot;Visser&quot; is set during and after the events of &quot;The Proposal&quot;, but the book also covers events before &quot;The Andalite Chronicles&quot;.
*&quot;36: The Mutation&quot;
*&quot;37: The Weakness&quot;
*&quot;38: The Arrival&quot;
*&quot;39: The Hidden&quot;

*&quot;The Ellimist Chronicles&quot; (story stretching billions of years into the past)
**Technically this is set during the same time as the first chapters of &quot;The Beginning&quot; even though it covers events set far before &quot;The Andalite Chronicles&quot;.

<doc id="1265632" wikidata="Q1295182" url="?curid=1265632" title="USS Harry E. Yarnell">
<text>USS &quot;Harry E. Yarnell&quot; (DLG/CG-17) was a &quot;Leahy&quot;-class guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy. Named in honor of Admiral Harry E. Yarnell, she was originally classified as a &quot;destroyer leader&quot; or frigate, in 1975 she was redesignated a cruiser in the Navy&#x27;s ship reclassification. She was the second of the &quot;double-end&quot; &quot;Leahy&quot;-class guided missile frigates to join the fleet.

==Construction==
&quot;Harry E. Yarnell&quot; was launched 9 December 1961 by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. Philip Yarnell, widow of Admiral Yarnell; and commissioned 2 February 1963 at the Boston Naval Shipyard.

==History==

&quot;Harry E. Yarnell&quot; was equipped with RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile launching rails both fore and aft and ASROC anti-submarine missiles, as well as more conventional torpedo tubes and guns. The new ship was fitted out at Boston and began sea trials. While out on trials, &quot;Yarnell&quot; was diverted on 10 April 1963 to search for USS &quot;Thresher&quot; (SSN-593), the nuclear submarine later found on the bottom some 8,000 feet down. Quartering the area where the sub was last reported, the guided missile frigate found an oil slick and some debris but could not contact the lost submarine.

On her way to her new home base, Naval Station Norfolk, on 23 April, &quot;Harry E. Yarnell&quot; passed and photographed several Soviet &quot;merchant&quot; ships. The next few months were spent conducting training for shakedown and missile qualification. Designated to carry out standardization trials for her class as well as special acoustical tests, &quot;Yarnell&quot; spent 28 October–26 November in the Caribbean operating out of Guantanamo Bay and then returned to Norfolk.

&quot;Yarnell&quot; continued operating in the Virginia Capes area and the Caribbean until departing from Norfolk on 8 September 1964 for her first Atlantic crossing. NATO ASW exercises en route took the guided missile frigate far north, and she crossed the Arctic Circle on 21 September. She visited Amsterdam en route to the Mediterranean, where she remained until returning to Norfolk in February 1965.

On her next Mediterranean deployment, which began 8 October, she transited the Dardanelles on 3 January 1966 and entered the Black Sea to operate close to the Soviet Union before returning to Norfolk in March. After NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, &quot;Harry E. Yarnell&quot; received the battle efficiency &quot;E&quot; for the preceding year. She also won the 1966 Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

Operations in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean brought the ship and her crew to a high degree of readiness before she sailed for her 3rd Mediterranean deployment early in 1967. She cruised the Mediterranean until returning to Norfolk in May. At mid-year she operated in the North Atlantic.

After the upgrade in Bath, Maine, in 1969, the Yarnell made her way to Boston Naval Shipyard. The &quot;Yarnell&quot; was given a new crew and recommissioned for service in Boston. The &quot;Yarnell&quot; was then assigned to Naval Station Newport. A year of testing all the new systems and the &quot;Yarnell&quot; set sail in July, 1970 on a UNITAS cruise for exercises with the naval forces of South American countries. Following departure from Newport and an overnight visit at Dam Neck, VA, Yarnell sailed to San Juan, Puerto Rico to pick up the admiral for the cruise. The &quot;Yarnell&quot; visited Caracas, Venezuela; and Salvador, Rio de Janeiro (twice) and São Paulo, Brazil. A scheduled visit to Montevideo, Uruguay was cancelled due to political activity there, so &quot;Yarnell&quot; returned to Rio de Janeiro for a second visit. Following a stop in Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina to take on supplies, &quot;Yarnell&quot; proceeded through the Magellan Straits and the Chilean Waterway into the Pacific Ocean, where stops were made in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama before going through the Panama Canal and returning to Newport via San Juan and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.

In late 1972, the &quot;Yarnell&quot; was again deployed to the Mediterranean. On the way across the Atlantic a helicopter from a Russian cruiser flew around the &quot;Yarnell&quot; taking many photographs. The &quot;Yarnell&quot; was ordered to accompany the Russia submarines from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Black Sea. &quot;Yarnell&quot; made port visits at Naples, Genoa, and Venice, Italy; Nice, France; Mallorca, Valencia and Barcelona, Spain; and Athens, Corfu, Rhodes, and Kavalla; Greece.

&quot;Yarnell&quot; returned to the Mediterranean in August 1973. En route she visited Lisbon, Portugal, then took part in Exercise Quickshave off the coasts of France, England and Portugal, followed by turnover in Rota with the . &quot;Yarnell&quot; then deployed to La Palma, followed by Western Med operations as a picket with a short return afterward, to Palma. Group Operations off Crete along with an ORE, were followed by a trip to Athens. Further visits to Barcelona and Malaga occurred before turnover in Rota to on 14 January, &quot;Yarnell&quot; returning to Newport on 24 January 1974. After a short period of local operations, the &quot;Yarnell&quot; entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a one-year overhaul.
Completion of overhaul also included a trip to New York, during which time she briefly ran aground, before ammunition load-out at Naval Weapons Station Earle, and a Home Port change to Norfolk. Refresher Training at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, with a visit over 4 July to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, followed by local operations off Virginia.

The entire &quot;Leahy&quot; class was given an AAW upgrade during the late-1970s and early 1980s. The 3/50s were replaced by 8 RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, the Terrier launchers were upgraded to fire the Standard missile, and 2 Phalanx CIWS were added. All were upgraded under the late-1980s NTU program. This included new radars, a new combat system, new fire control systems, and upgraded missiles and missile launchers.

On 19 November 1980 &quot;Yarnell&quot;, under the command of Captain Howard F. Burdick Jr, sailed with the and her battle group to the Arabian Sea/Indian Ocean, during which the ship made port calls at Mombasa, Kenya and Perth and Fremantle, Australia from 3–7 February 1981. The &quot;Yarnell&quot; returned home to Norfolk Naval Base, VA, on 10 June 1981.

In late June 1990, Rear Admiral Thomas D. Paulson, Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group Two, led the &quot;Yarnell&quot; and to visit Poland in conjunction with BALTOPS &#x27;90, a U.S. Naval Forces Europe-hosted international naval exercise in the Baltic Sea. Their port call at Gdynia was the first visit by United States Navy vessels to Poland since 1927.

==Fate==
&quot;Harry E. Yarnell&quot; was decommissioned on 20 October 1993, and stricken on 29 October 1993. She was sold on 14 April 1995 for scrapping at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, but the scrap contract was terminated on 1 December 1996 (scrapping 10% complete), and the hulk returned to Philadelphia for storage. Scrapping was ultimately completed in April 2002.

<text>Harold William Vazeille Temperley, (20 April 1879 – 11 July 1939) was an English historian, Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge from 1931, and Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge.

== Overview ==

Temperley was born in Cambridge, the son of Ernest Temperley, a Fellow and Bursar of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. He was educated at Sherborne School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he obtained a First in History. He became a lecturer at the University of Leeds in 1903, before taking a fellowship at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1905.

Temperley&#x27;s field was modern diplomatic history, and he was heavily involved as editor in the publication of the British Government&#x27;s official version of the diplomatic history of the early 20th century. He also wrote on George Canning and Eastern European history.

During World War I, Temperley was commissioned into the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry, missing the Gallipoli landings due to illness. He was then seconded to the War Office, working on intelligence and policy in the Balkans. His &quot;History of Serbia&quot; was published in 1917.

He attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and later worked on an official history of it, on a scheme devised by George Louis Beer and Lord Eustace Percy. He was British representative on the Albanian boundary commission; and was an advisor in 1921 to Arthur Balfour at the League of Nations.

In the compilation of the &quot;British Documents on the Origins of the War&quot; he collaborated with George Peabody Gooch, (1873–1968), another diplomatic historian and a member of parliament for the Liberal Party from 1906 to 1910. Gooch had spoken out against British policy in the Second Boer War, and was also a historian of Germany; his appointment was designed to give the project a credible independence.

In the event, Temperley and Gooch were constrained financially, and in the use of documents subject to a &#x27;fifty year rule&#x27; limitation on their release. To get their own way, they had to employ tactical resignation threats. Lillian Margery Penson (1896–1963) was involved in both this and a later project on the &quot;Blue Books&quot;.

In 1923 Temperley founded &quot;The Cambridge Historical Journal&quot; at Cambridge.

Temperley was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1938.

The historian Herbert Butterfield was a student of Temperley. He commented later in life on how the ageing Temperley and Charles Webster, an equally aged historian, dominated the college Combination Room, &quot;like booming giants, cumbersome and dangerous to crockery, bulging with warmth and good feeling, yet capable of overbearingness – terrible lions if you trod on their tales [sic]&quot;. Tempeley also influenced British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s European foreign policy, including appeasement of the Axis Powers and the Munich Agreement.

<text>A breathing mask is a mask that covers the mouth, nose, and optionally other parts of the face or head, designed to constrain and direct the wearer&#x27;s breath to and/or from a particular breathing apparatus. It may mean, or be part of, one of these types:

* In medical treatment
** For cardiopulmonary resuscitation
*** Bag valve mask, a device used in resuscitation of non-breathing casualties, optionally using supplementary oxygen.
*** Pocket CPR mask, a simpler mask used for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation; easier to carry than bag valve masks
** For supplying oxygen or oxygen enriched air
*** Built-in breathing system (BIBS) mask, an oro-nasal mask providing treatment, decompression, or emergency gas in a hyperbaric chamber
*** Non-rebreather mask, an oro-nasal mask used in medicine to assist in the delivery of oxygen therapy
*** Oxygen mask, which covers the mouth and nose of a patient undergoing oxygen therapy as first aid or longer-term treatment, or a passenger in an aircraft which has depressurised at altitude
** Continuous positive airway pressure mask
** Anesthetic mask

* For infection control
** Surgical mask, also known as a procedure mask, is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery, to protect the patient from being infected by the operating theatre staff&#x27;s breath.
** Cloth mask; early surgical masks were cloth. Cloth masks are also used for protection in pandemics.
** Respirators (see below) may also be used for infection control

* As a personal protective equipment respirator a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful dusts, fumes, vapors or gases
**Air-filtering respirators
*** Dust mask, a flexible pad held over the nose and mouth by elastic or rubber straps to protect against dusts encountered during construction or cleaning activities. Usually uncertified, and thus not considered a &quot;respirator&quot; in some jurisdictions.
*** Filtering facepiece respirator, a stiffish dome of filter material fitting over the nose, cheeks, and chin. May look like some dust masks, but is certified.
*** Elastomeric respirator, with the facepiece made of flexible elastomer, usually reusable with disposable filters. May protect against particulates, gasses, or both, depending on the filters used.
**** Gas mask, respirator designed to protect the user from toxic gases in conflicts
**** Early smoke-mask respiratorss for firefighters (similar to diving helmets, but with air-filtering)
**Atmosphere-supplying respirators
*** SCBA mask, or BA mask, a full face mask covering the mouth, nose and eyes of a person wearing self-contained breathing apparatus, connected to a breathing gas supply carried by the user
**** Rebreather mask
*** Underwater breathing masks
**** Full face snorkelling mask, a watertight mask with integrated air passages allowing the user to breathe atmospheric air while swimming face-down at the surface of the water
**** Full face diving mask, watertight masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, allowing the wearer to breathe underwater from a self-contained or surface-supplied breathing gas supply
**** Band mask, a heavy duty full-face diving mask for surface-supplied diving
**** Diving helmet, covering the entire head in a dome of air.

*By coverage
**Quarter-mask or orinasal mask, covering the mouth and nose only
**Half-mask (disambiguation), from below the eyes to below the chin
**Fullface mask, from above the eyes to below the chin</text><links>

<text>The Western Canadian Baseball League (WCBL) is a collegiate summer baseball league. The league is home to teams based in the Canadian Prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, and has roots dating back to 1931 in Saskatchewan&#x27;s Southern Baseball League. In 1975, the province&#x27;s southern and northern leagues merged, creating the foundation for the WCBL. Today, the league boasts seven teams in Alberta and five in Saskatchewan.

==History==

The league can trace its roots back to 1931, via its predecessors, the Southern Baseball League (1931 to 1974) and the Northern Saskatchewan Baseball League (1959 to 1974). The Saskatchewan Major Baseball League (SMBL) was formed in 1975 through a merger of the Southern and Northern leagues. Three teams from each former league entered the new loop—the Eston Ramblers, Saskatoon Royals, and Unity Cardinals from the north, and the Moose Jaw Devons, Regina Red Sox, and Swift Current Indians from the south.

The league was renamed the Western Major Baseball League in 2000 to reflect teams based in Alberta, along with the possibility of future expansion to British Columbia. In June 2018, it was announced that the league would be renamed the Western Canadian Baseball League.

The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to COVID-19 restrictions and logistics, the 2021 season was played with only five Alberta-based teams and Canadian players only.

==Teams==
, WCBL membership consists of 12 teams in two divisions. The West Division is made up of six Albertan teams, while the East Division is made up of all five teams from Saskatchewan, plus the easternmost Albertan team from Medicine Hat. The top four teams in each division qualify for the post-season.
=== Current teams ===
=== Former teams ===
=== Expansion ===
Cranbrook, British Columbia, was granted an expansion team, the Eds, in 2011 conditional on building a new stadium. However, the plans failed to come to fruition.

In May 2020, the Edmonton Prospects confirmed that the team would be leaving Edmonton for Spruce Grove by 2022, but due to construction delays at Myshak Metro Ballpark, those plans have been pushed back.

The two most recent additions to the league are in Sylvan Lake and Saskatoon. Plans for a 2021 launch of the Sylvan Lake team were announced November 1, 2019. Branding as the Sylvan Lake Gulls was announced in March 2020. Saskatoon was awarded the most recent expansion team, in 2023. In July 2023, the team unveiled that it would be called the Saskatoon Berries.

==Harry Hallis Memorial Trophy==

Saskatchewan Territorial (1895–1905) and Provincial (1906–present) champions have been decided by an annual tournament. In 1967 the first major division was added to the tournament, and the award was named in memory of Harry Hallis. From 1967 until 1974 the name of this provincial champion was added to the trophy. In 1975, when the Saskatchewan Major Baseball League was formed, this trophy continued to be awarded to the SMBL champions, and now the WCBL champions.

<text>Leopold Hermann Ludwig von Boyen (20 June 1771 – 15 February 1848) was a Prussian army officer who helped to reform the Prussian Army in the early 19th century. He also served as minister of war of Prussia in the period 1810–1813 and again from 1 March 1841 – 6 October 1847.

==Life==
Born in Kreuzburg (today&#x27;s Slavskoye, Russia) in East Prussia, Boyen joined the army in 1784 in Königsberg. In 1788, as a newly minted second lieutenant, he took up a post in the military academy in Königsberg, where he also attended some of the lectures of Immanuel Kant.

From 1794 to 1796, Boyen took part in the Polish campaign as Adjutant to General von Günther. In 1799, he became a captain. He served in the war of 1806 on the General Staff of the Duke of Brunswick, and was wounded at the Battle of Auerstädt (14 October 1806). After the Treaty of Tilsit (July 1807) he became a major and a member of Gerhard von Scharnhorst&#x27;s commission for military re-organisation.

By 1810 Boyen had become Director of the Military Cabinet. In the re-constitution of the Prussian army he functioned as Scharnhorst&#x27;s most diligent helper, but after the conclusion of the alliance between Prussia and France in 1812 he resigned his commission as a colonel and visited Vienna and St Petersburg. The events of 1813 saw him recalled to the Prussian service: as a colonel he accompanied the Russian army from its base in Kalisz to Saxony. After the Battle of Lützen (2 May 1813) he had charge of the border guards and ultimately the defence of Berlin. But during the truce King Frederick William III named him Chief of General Staff of the 3rd Army Corps. As such, Boyen participated in the battles and skirmishes of 1813 and 1814 and gained promotion to major-general.

After the first Peace of Paris (30 May 1814) Boyen took up his appointment as War Minister. He completed the setting up of the &quot;Landwehr&quot; reserve (begun during the war) and in 1818 became a lieutenant general. He struggled in vain against growing reactionary forces which endangered the broad popular base of the &quot;Landwehr&quot;, and resigned in 1819.

For 21 years Boyen lived in retirement, occupying himself with historical studies, until King Frederick William IV, immediately after ascending the throne, recalled him to active service, and promoted him to general of the infantry. In March 1841 he once again took over the War Ministry, though without achieving a great influence in the general political situation. He resigned in November 1847, received the rank of field marshal, and died on 15 February 1848. The King named the fortress of Lötzen in East Prussia after him.

Boyen&#x27;s son, also named Hermann von Boyen, was General Adjutant to the King. He retired a governor of Berlin in 1879. Hermann von Boyen was buried at the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin. The former football club Yorck Boyen Insterburg was named in honor of Boyen.

==Works==
Hermann von Boyen wrote (among other works):
* &quot;Beiträge zur Kenntnis des Generals v. Scharnhorst&quot; (1833)
* &quot;Erinnerungen aus dem Leben des Generalleutnants v. Günther&quot; (1834).
*&quot;Vorwärts!: ein Husaren-Tagebuch und Feldzugsbriefe von Gebhardt Leberecht von Blücher&quot; etc. (1914, diary during his period under the Hussars)
*&quot;Gesammelte Schriften und Briefe&quot; / Blücher, Yorck, Gneisenau; zusammengestellt und hrsg. von Edmund Th. Kauer (1932, letters, including those to Yorck and Gneisenau)
*&quot;Kampagne-Journal der Jahre 1793 und 1794&quot; (1796, campaign journal)

He also wrote the song &quot;Der Preußen Losung&quot; (1838).

<text>Jubilee quartets were popular African-American religious musical groups in the first half of the 20th century. The name derives from the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a group of singers organized by George L. White at Fisk University in 1871 to sing Negro spirituals. The members of the original Fisk Jubilee Quartet (1909–1916) were Alfred G. King (first bass), James A. Myers (second tenor), Noah W. Ryder (second bass), and John W. Work II (first tenor). Students at other historically black schools, such as Hampton Institute, Tuskegee Institute and Wilberforce University, followed suit. Many independent jubilee troupes also found inspiration in the Fisk Jubilee Singers, such as the Original Nashville Students.

The early jubilee quartets featured close harmonies, formal arrangements and a &quot;flatfooted&quot; style of singing that emphasized restrained musical expression and technique derived from Western musical traditions. Early quartets reinforced their respectable image by adopting uniforms that a university glee club might wear and discouraging improvisation.

In time, however, the popularity of the jubilee style spread from the universities to black churches, where quartets, singing before audiences with a tradition of enthusiastic response, began to absorb much of the energy and freedom of Gospel music coming out of Holiness churches. Groups such as the Golden Gate Quartet—originally named the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet—infused their performances of spirituals with the rhythmic beat of blues and jazz and gradually began including gospel standards written by Thomas A. Dorsey and others in their repertoire. The Gates and other jubilee quartets gained nationwide popularity through radio broadcasts, records and touring in the 1930s and 1940s.

Other groups, such as the Dixie Hummingbirds and the Original Five Blind Boys of Alabama (formally known as the Happyland Jubilee Singers) that had begun singing in the conventional jubilee style went further, creating the more improvisational and fervent style of quartet singing known as &quot;hard Gospel&quot;. That new style largely eclipsed jubilee singing by the 1950s.

<doc id="1265696" wikidata="Q3046430" url="?curid=1265696" title="Reversible lane">
<text>A reversible lane, also known as variable lane, dynamic lane, and tidal flow, is a managed lane in which traffic may travel in either direction, depending on certain conditions. Typically, it is meant to improve traffic flow during rush hours, by having overhead traffic lights and lighted street signs notifying drivers which lanes are open or closed to driving or turning.

Reversible lanes are also commonly found in tunnels and on bridges, and on the surrounding roadways – even where the lanes are not regularly reversed to handle normal changes in traffic flow. The presence of lane controls allows authorities to close or reverse lanes when unusual circumstances (such as construction or a traffic mishap) require use of fewer or more lanes to maintain orderly flow of traffic.
==Disambiguation==
There are similar setups with slightly different usages, although the terms may be commonly used interchangeably.

Contraflow Lane: Typically used to refer to a bus lane running against a one-way street through the opposite direction

Contraflow Lane Reversal: Typically used to refer to a temporary setup of a lane running opposite to normal during special times, such as emergency evacuations, sports tournaments, or road construction/repairs.

Reversible Lane: Typically used to refer to a lane specifically designed to facilitate different directional usage regularly, with changes sometimes as frequent as twice a day.

===Types===

There are typically three types of reversible lanes: 

* reversible travel-lanes - for travelling a longer distance
* median passing lanes - for a quick overtaking
* median turning lanes - for stopping to turn into a facility

While &quot;reversible lane&quot; is a commonly used term, other terms include variable lanes, dynamic lanes, and flex lanes.

==Separation of flows==
Some more recent implementations of reversible lanes use a movable barrier to establish a physical separation between allowed and disallowed lanes of travel. In some systems, a concrete barrier is moved during low-traffic periods to switch a central lane from one side of the road to another; some examples are the five-lane San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge in San Diego, California, the seven-lane Alex Fraser Bridge on the Fraser River in Vancouver and the eight-lane Auckland Harbour Bridge across the Waitemata Harbour in Auckland, New Zealand. Other systems use retractable cones or bollards which are built into the road, or retractable fences which can divert traffic from a reversible ramp. The two center lanes of the six-lane Golden Gate Bridge are reversible; they are southbound during morning rush hour and northbound at evening rush hour. Prior to the installation of a movable median barrier in January 2015, they were demarcated by vertical yellow markers placed manually in sockets in the roadway.

Many urban freeways have entirely separate carriageways (and connecting ramps) to hold reversible lanes (the reversible lanes in such a configuration are often referred to as &quot;express lanes&quot;). Generally, traffic flows in one direction or another in such a configuration (or not at all); the carriageways are not &quot;split&quot; into two-lane roadways during non-rush periods. Typically, this sort of express lane will have fewer interchanges than the primary lanes, and many such roadways only provide onramps for inbound traffic, and offramps for outbound traffic.

==Passing lanes==

Historically, the term &quot;suicide lane&quot; has also referred to a lane in the center of a highway meant for passing in both directions. Neither direction has the right-of-way, and both directions are permitted to use the lane for passing. In a similar layout, three lanes are striped with two in one direction and one in the other, but traffic in the direction with one lane is allowed to cross the centerline to pass.

Passing lanes should not be confused with turning lanes. While they look similar, passing lanes are for highway overtaking, while turning lanes typically are used to stop and turn into a parking lot from a street.

2+1 roads have replaced some of these, mainly in Europe.

==Turn lanes and flush medians==


Another type of center two-way lane is a &quot;two-way left turn lane&quot; (TWLT) or &quot;center left-turn lane&quot;, or (for countries that drive on the right) &quot;center turn lane&quot; or &quot;median turn lane&quot;, a single lane in the center of the road into which traffic from both directions pulls to make a left turn. This lane is also sometimes called a &quot;suicide lane&quot; for their notorious fatality rates, especially in the United States in settings with high traffic speeds (45 mph), and on roads with five or more lanes (typically two or three lanes in each travel direction with one center turn lane). However, some studies have found that converting high-speed four lane streets into three lane streets (one lane of traffic in each direction with a center turn lane) and lowering speed limits can result in improved safety, despite the use of a center turn lane, as traffic collisions occur at far lower speeds.

These roads are very common in suburban areas and less common in rural areas, though they are frequent around developed areas near Interstate Highway bypasses in the United States. Many were divided highways before the median was demolished or otherwise replaced by the turn lane. Many four-lane streets with a center double yellow line are being phased out in favor of 3- or five-lane streets with center turn lanes because the center lane allows for less disruption of traffic flow. For routes with moderate traffic, other movements involve downgrading four-lane undivided streets to three-lane streets with a turn-only center lane.

This center lane can be used by emergency vehicles like police cars, ambulance, and fire trucks to avoid traffic traveling in either direction. Drivers are not allowed to use the center lane of such a highway for passing slow-moving vehicles, except when funding or space constraints dictate use of it as a rush hour &quot;travel lane&quot; when traffic is largely asymmetric between a central business district and its suburbs. U.S. Route 13 near the Greenville, North Carolina, city limits is a rare instance of a posted warning sign that states &quot;do not pass in center lane&quot;.

This reversible travel lane was replaced with a two-way left turn lane.

Indiana
*In Indianapolis, Fall Creek Parkway North Drive between Central Avenue and Evanston Avenue has 5 lanes (7 in some sections) with 1 lane marked as reversible. Configuration is typically designed to allow for 3 in, 2 out during morning rush hours, and 2 in, 3 out during afternoon rush hours. Due to Fall Creek Parkway&#x27;s proximity to the Indiana State Fairgrounds, lane configurations change periodically to facilitate traffic flow during events at the fairgrounds.

Kentucky
*Clay Wade Bailey Bridge in Covington (3 lanes total, 1 reversible)
*Nicholasville Road (US 27) in Lexington has reversible lanes (lane signals, no physical separation) starting at its intersection with Conn Terrace at the University of Kentucky campus and ending at New Circle Road, the city&#x27;s inner beltway. During morning rush hour, as well as the hours before UK football home games, southbound traffic (away from the UK campus and downtown) is restricted to one lane between campus and Southland Drive, and two lanes from Southland to New Circle. Northbound traffic faces the same restrictions in the evening rush hour and immediately after football games. During off-peak hours, an equal number of lanes are dedicated to traffic in each direction. One dedicated left-turn lane is always provided regardless of the current traffic configuration.
* Baxter Avenue and Bardstown Road (US 31E) in Louisville have reversible lanes (lane signals without any physical separation) for miles through The Highlands, starting at their intersection with Lexington Road in the north and ending at Douglass Boulevard in the south. This stretch of road has four lanes, but on-street parking frequently restricts traffic to one lane in each direction outside of rush hours. During rush hours, parking is prohibited north of Douglass Boulevard. Southbound traffic leaving downtown Louisville is restricted to one lane during the morning rush hour, with northbound traffic having the same restriction during the evening rush hour. Also, the lane immediately to the left of rush-hour through traffic becomes a dedicated left-turn lane. Electronic signs over the roadway alert motorists to the traffic flow dedication of each lane. According to a 2017 traffic study, this is the only road in the United States that has &quot;both&quot; lane lights and on-street parking. In 2018, a proposed called for ending this traffic arrangement.

Maryland
*Chesapeake Bay Bridge (a portion of US 50) near Annapolis (5 lanes total, all marked reversible, 1 usually reversed for normal peak traffic). However, due to its dual spans, when there are 2 eastbound lanes and 3 westbound the opposing sides are completely divided, this is the usual configuration.
*Hanover Street Bridge in Baltimore has 5 lanes total marked reversible, with 1 usually reversed for normal peak traffic).
*Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring has 7 lanes. During most hours, the center lane is marked with a yellow lit &quot;X&quot; as a left turn lane for both directions. During morning and evening rush hours, the lane is marked with a down facing green arrow – southbound in the morning, northbound in the evening – or a red &quot;X&quot; – northbound in the morning, southbound in the evening – and left turns are prohibited.
*Colesville Road (US 29) in Silver Spring has 6 lanes. During off-rush hours, three lanes go in each direction. During morning rush hours, four lanes (marked with green arrows) go southbound, while northbound (marked with Xs in those lanes) is relegated to two lanes. During afternoon rush, the process is reversed.
*Clara Barton Parkway operates as a one-way road between the MacArthur Boulevard Exit and Chain Bridge on weekday mornings and afternoons
*Gay Street in Baltimore between North Avenue and Preston Street has 3 lanes. The middle lane is reversible with northbound/outbound traffic using the lane in the afternoon and southbound/inbound traffic using the lane in the morning.

*Mackinac Bridge (a portion of I-75) near St Ignace treats the passing lane of the southbound side as a temporary northbound lane during the Labor Day bridge walk, at which time the northbound side is used for pedestrians.
*Like 7th Street and 7th Avenue in Phoenix, at one time Michigan Avenue in Dearborn had a reversible lane between Telegraph Road (US 24) and the Southfield Freeway which was marked with lane signals. These have since been removed.

Nebraska
*Dodge Street (US 6) between Turner Boulevard and 68th Street in Omaha: no physical separation; lanes marked with overhead lane-use control signals. Center lane direction is eastbound from 5:50am–9:00am and westbound from 9:00am–5:50am.
*Farnam Street between Saddle Creek Road and 57th Street in Omaha: no physical separation; lanes marked with lane-use control signals and LED signs. On weekdays the direction is one-way eastbound 7am-9am, and one-way westbound 4pm-6pm.

New Jersey
*Lincoln Tunnel&#x27;s center tube (one of three in total) is reversible. In general, both of the lanes, including one &quot;XBL&quot; (Exclusive Bus Lane), serve Manhattan-bound traffic during the weekday morning rush hour, both of the lanes serve New Jersey-bound traffic during the weekday evening rush hour, and one lane is provided in each direction during other time periods.
*Since 1970, the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix in Hudson County supports an &quot;XBL&quot;, or &quot;Exclusive Bus Lane,&quot; on Route 495 during the weekday morning peak period (approximately 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 a.m.). Eastbound buses travel in this reversible lane to the approach to the toll plaza at the Lincoln Tunnel, at the other end of which is the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. The lane is fed by the New Jersey Turnpike at Exits 16E and 17, and the western terminus of Route 3. Both the tunnel and terminal are owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bi-state agency that also operates the reversible, express bus lane along the left lane of three westbound lanes. The XBL serves over 1,800 buses, which transport more than 65,000 persons, each morning and is a major component of the morning &quot;inbound&quot; commutation crossing the Hudson River. Over 100 bus carriers utilize the Exclusive Bus Lane. New Jersey Transit operates numerous interstate bus routes through the Lincoln Tunnel, as do numerous regional and long-distance companies.
*Walt Whitman Bridge, Ben Franklin Bridge and Commodore Barry Bridge over the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania use moveable medians, to create zipper lanes.

New York
*Upper level of the Queensboro Bridge in New York City has four lanes and can have all flowing inbound (AM peak), or two lanes each direction in normal configuration.
*Mid-Hudson Bridge in Poughkeepsie, New York, has a reversible center lane used during rush hour.

North Carolina
*East 7th Street in Charlotte
*US 29 in Charlotte
**This road is the access road to Charlotte Motor Speedway from the city, and links to Interstate 485. It is used for any events at the speedway.

Ohio
*(Formerly) Butler Street in Sandusky, used to route traffic between US 250 and Cleveland Road, featured a reversible center lane to facilitate influxes of traffic going to and from Cedar Point.

Pennsylvania
*Liberty Bridge near the southern terminus of I-579 in Pittsburgh has 4 lanes, all of which are potentially reversible, and 2 of which are reversed based on rush-hour times.
*West End Bridge in Pittsburgh has 4 lanes, which are all potentially reversible.
*West General Robinson Street near Heinz Field in Pittsburgh has 4 lanes, and 2 are reversible.

South Carolina
*The Silas N. Pearman Bridge, demolished in 2005, originally contained a third reversible lane, leftmost when heading north on US 17. This was converted to a fixed truck lane for southbound traffic shortly after its construction in the 1960s, as an inspection of its companion bridge, the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge, revealed it was no longer strong enough to carry truck traffic. Both bridges would eventually be rendered obsolete and replaced by the Ravenel Bridge.

Tennessee
*US 70 in Nashville has three reversible lanes (lane signals, Traffic Lights, without any physical separation) from Korean Veterans Boulevard to just east of a railroad crossing, there is a break in the reversible lanes between Willow Street and Lindsley Avenue.
*Victory Memorial Bridge in Nashville has 5 lanes, with only the center lane begin a reversible lanes (lane signals without any physical separation).

Texas
*West Alabama Street and North Main Street in Houston – both are three-lane streets, which operate in a 2 in, 1 out configuration during the morning rush, a 1 in, 2 out configuration during the evening rush, and a 1 each way + two-way left turn lane at other times.
*North Collins Street from Cowboys Way to East Division Street, and East Division Street from North Collins Street to Six Flags Drive, just east of SH 360 are reversible to give access to Cowboys Stadium in Arlington

Utah
*5400 South (SR-173) in Salt Lake County between 1900 West and Bangerter Highway has seven lanes, three of which are reversible and include a center turning lane at all times.

Virginia
*Washington Boulevard (SR 237) in Arlington County between 13th Street and Wilson Boulevard – this one-block section has only 3 lanes with the center lane reversible by overhead light up indicators.
*River Road in Newport News between 75th Street and Shipyard Drive. This is the truck route for Newport News Shipbuilding.

===Lane controls and physical separation===
*The A38(M) motorway (also known as the Aston Expressway) in Birmingham, England. The road connects the city centre with Spaghetti Junction on the M6. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50 mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom&#x27;s first contraflow road. Overhead lane control signals allow for 4 lanes in and 2 out in the morning rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each way at all other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The lane control signals can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which has been used for single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required.
*U.S. Route 78 in Snellville, Georgia, United States, has 6 lanes in total. This occurs from the limited access portion through Stone Mountain Park to Georgia State Route 124 (Scenic Highway) for several miles. The middle two lanes were reversible (usually occurring during rush hour) with a varying lane always reserved as a center turn lane; hence 3 lanes were used for one direction of travel and 2 for the other. However, due to rising traffic volumes during peak hours that made traffic flows equivalent, the reversible lane system was removed in 2009.
* The Caldecott Tunnel between Oakland, California and Contra Costa County, previously had three separate bores, with the middle bore switching direction twice daily for rush hour traffic. A fourth tunnel bore opened in November 2013 to westbound traffic. Two bores are now permanently used by westbound traffic, and the other two by eastbound traffic, with no reversible lanes.
* The Elbe Tunnel near Hamburg, Germany, is part of the Bundesautobahn A7 and has four separate bores, of which two can be switched to allow travel either in each direction or unidirectionally.

===Lane controls and physical separation by movable barrier===
*Benjamin Franklin Bridge, Walt Whitman Bridge, and Commodore Barry Bridge in Philadelphia
*Tappan Zee Bridge (1955) in New York
*Theodore Roosevelt Bridge in Washington, D.C.
*Auckland Harbour Bridge in Auckland, New Zealand
*San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge in San Diego, California (part of California Route 75)
*Southeast Expressway in and near Boston, Massachusetts
*A reversible lane, also called a zipper lane, is in use on eastbound Interstate H-1 for traffic heading from Leeward Oahu to Pearl Harbor. It is open from 5:30 to 9:00 a.m.
*The Golden Gate Bridge (6 lanes total, 2 reversible), connecting San Francisco with suburban Marin County. Prior to 2015, opposing traffic lanes were separated only by plastic pylons, which were moved several times daily by hand and provided minimal physical separation. Installation of a movable median barrier was completed on January 11, 2015.
*Alex Fraser Bridge in Vancouver, British Columbia (7 lanes total, 1 reversible)
*Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York City (7 lanes total, 1 reversible)

*Lincoln Tunnel between Weehawken, New Jersey and the New York City borough of Manhattan has three tubes with two lanes each. The center tube carries two lanes in peak direction weekdays (with a reserved inbound bus lane during the AM rush period) and a single lane each direction off-peak (nights, weekends, holidays).
*Multiple freeways in Houston have reversible center HOV lanes operated by Houston METRO.
*A1 motorway between the interchanges of A9 and A6, Amsterdam, Netherlands. A two lane carriage is opened in the peak direction during rush hours.

===Entire roadway routinely reversed===
* The Anchieta/Imigrantes highway system in Brazil contains the world&#x27;s longest fully reversible road (The Imigrantes variant at a length of 58.5 km). It comprises a total of ten lanes distributed over four separate roadways (3+3+2+2), each of which can be reversed. Traffic flow is unidirectional on up to three roadways at a time, in different combinations, depending on demand. Since this highway system is the only quick route from São Paulo to the beach, the majority of the traffic on Fridays and Sundays are cars on weekend trips, creating highly asymmetrical demand.
* In Washington, D.C., the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway between the Lincoln Memorial and Calvert St. is converted from two lanes in each direction to one-way southbound in the morning and one-way northbound in the evening rush hour Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. The P Street exit, usually unavailable northbound, is an allowed left exit in the evening. South of Virginia Avenue, two lanes are closed during rush hours to facilitate the merge to or from Virginia Avenue. There are no overhead markings, but police barricades block wrong-way entrances to the roadway.
*Canal Road in Washington, D.C. (between Foxhall Road and Arizona Avenue)
*Sherman Access in Hamilton, Ontario. Two lanes total, both marked as reversible, with both lanes flowing in the same direction during rush hour each weekday.
*Assembly Street and Bluff Road (both part of South Carolina 48), along with Shop Road and George Rogers Boulevard in Columbia, South Carolina, are one-way during University of South Carolina football games at Williams-Brice Stadium.
*The lower deck of the Centre Street Bridge in Calgary, Alberta, is fully reversible. It normally allows for two-way traffic, but both lanes flow in the same direction during rush hour each day.
*Victoria Bridge, in Montreal, Quebec, normally allows for two-way traffic. But during rush hours, it only allows one-way traffic, northbound in the morning, and southbound in the afternoon.
*Farnam Street in Omaha is a normally two-way, two-lane street that during rush hour becomes one-way eastbound in the morning and westbound in the evening.
*Sierichstraße in Hamburg, Germany, a fully reversible, two-lane city street.
*The White Nile Bridge connecting Khartoum and Omdurman in Sudan, with four lanes total. Traffic is generally directed equally, two lanes to Khartoum and two lanes from except in the morning, where it is three lanes towards Khartoum, and in the evening, three lanes towards Omdurman.
*In Hong Kong, most vehicular tunnels are dual tube. In the early hours one of the tubes will be closed, and one of the lanes in the other tube carries reversed traffic.
*The Baker–Barry Tunnel, one of only two means of access to the Marin Headlands from U.S. Route 101 in Marin County, California, is not wide enough to accommodate bidirectional traffic. It consists of a single reversible lane for automobiles and two bicycle lanes. The direction of automobile traffic alternates every five minutes, controlled by a traffic light at each end of the tunnel. The bicycle lanes, one for each direction, are located on either side of the reversible lane; buttons on either side of the tunnel trigger flashing signs alerting drivers entering the tunnel to the presence of cyclists.

===Entire roadway formerly reversed===
*The Southern Expressway in Adelaide, South Australia, was the world&#x27;s longest exclusively one-way reversible road. It opened in 1997 and eventually traversed though the city&#x27;s southern suburbs, until its duplication to carry two-way traffic completed in 2014. It changed direction to carry peak hour traffic to the city centre in the morning and away from the city in the evening. On weekends, the directions were reversed.

===One lane formerly reversed===
*Motorway M7 in Hungary from 1972 until the completion of the second carriageway in 1975. The existing carriageway between Törökbálint and Zamárdi normally operated with one lane in each direction, but carried traffic towards Budapest only on Sunday afternoons.
*Alfords Point Bridge in Australia from 1973 till bridge duplication in 2008. The center lane was reversible. After 2008, a 300-metre reversible center lane still remained on Alfords Point Road over Henry Lawson Drive, approximately 500 meters north of this duplicated bridge.

== Escalators ==
In shopping centres and metro stations there may be an odd number of escalators, with one or more escalators running in different directions in different time of a day.

<text>Lester Frank Ward (June 18, 1841 – April 18, 1913) was an American botanist, paleontologist, and sociologist. The first president of the American Sociological Association, James Q. Dealey characterized Ward as a &quot;great pioneer&quot; in the development of American sociology, with contemporaries referring to him as &quot;the Nestor of American sociologists&quot;. His 1883 work &quot;Dynamic Sociology&quot; was influential in establishing sociology as a distinct field in the United States. However, despite its initial impact his work was quickly sidelined during the later institutionalization and development of American sociology.

==Biography==
===Childhood: 1841–1858===
Most, if not all of what is known about Ward&#x27;s early life comes from the biography, &quot;Lester F. Ward: A Personal Sketch&quot;, written by Emily Palmer Cape in 1922. Lester Frank Ward was born in Joliet, Illinois. He was the youngest of 10 children born to Justus Ward and his wife Silence Rolph Ward. Justus Ward (d. 1858) was of New England colonial descent and worked on farms in addition to being an itinerant mechanic. Silence Ward was the daughter of a clergyman; she was educated and fond of literature. The family lived in poverty during Ward&#x27;s early years.

When Ward was one year old, the family moved closer to Chicago, to Cass, now known as Downers Grove, Illinois about twenty-three miles from Lake Michigan. The family then moved to a homestead in nearby St. Charles, Illinois where Ward&#x27;s father built a saw mill business making railroad ties. As a child, Ward had to worked in farms, mills, and factories to supplement his family income, giving him little time for his education. Ward first attended a formal school at St. Charles, Kane County, Illinois, in 1850 when he was nine years old. He was known as Frank Ward to his classmates and friends and showed a great enthusiasm for books and learning, liberally supplementing his education with outside reading. Four years after Ward started attending school, his parents, along with Lester and an older brother, Erastus, traveled to Iowa in a covered wagon for a new life on the frontier.

===Starting college: 1858–1862===
In 1858, Justus Ward unexpectedly died, and the boys returned the family to the old homestead they still owned in St. Charles. Ward&#x27;s estranged mother, who lived two miles away with Ward&#x27;s sister, disapproved of the move, and wanted the boys to stay in Iowa to continue their father&#x27;s work.
The two brothers lived together for a short time in the old family homestead they dubbed &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Hall,&quot; doing farm work to earn a living, and encouraged each other to pursue an education and abandon their father&#x27;s life of physical labor.

In late 1858, the two brothers moved to Pennsylvania at the invitation of Lester Frank&#x27;s oldest brother Cyrenus (9 years Lester Frank&#x27;s senior), who was starting a business making wagon wheel hubs and needed workers. The brothers saw this as an opportunity to move closer to civilization and to eventually attend college.

The business failed, however, and Lester Frank, who still didn&#x27;t have the money to attend college, found a job teaching in a small country school; in the summer months he worked as a farm laborer. He finally saved enough money to attend college and enrolled in the Susquehanna Collegiate Institute in 1860. While he was at first self-conscious about his spotty formal education and self learning, he soon found that his knowledge compared favorably to his classmates&#x27;, and he was rapidly promoted.

===Civil War service and further studies: 1862–1873===
Ward was a &quot;fervent opponent of slavery&quot; and enlisted in the Union Army to fight in the Civil War in August, 1862. He suffered three gunshot wounds in the Battle of Chancellorsville and was discharged from service on November 18, 1864 due to physical disability. After the war, Ward moved to Washington. In Washington, he worked at the Treasury Department from 1865 until 1872. Ward attended Columbian College, now the George Washington University, and graduating in 1869 with the degree of A.B. In 1871, after he received the degree of LL.B, he was admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. However, Ward never practiced law. In 1873, he completed his A.M. degree.

===Government work and research in Washington, DC===

Ward concentrated on his work as a researcher for the federal government. At that time almost all of the basic research in such fields as geography, paleontology, archaeology and anthropology were concentrated in Washington, DC, and a job as a federal government scientist was a prestigious and influential position. From 1881 until 1888 Ward worked as an assistant geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey In 1883 he was made Geologist of the U.S. Geological Survey. While he worked at the Geological Survey he became friends with John Wesley Powell, the second director of the US Geological Survey (1881–1894) and the director of the Bureau of Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution. In 1892, he was named Paleontologist for the USGS, a position he held until 1906.

According to Edward Rafferty, Ward was part of a group of &quot;Washington intellectuals&quot; who &quot;wanted to place social science within the structure of government and public life itself&quot;. Ward believed that centering research activity in government actions would benefit democratic progress, and evade the partisanship, corruption, and conflict of post-Civil War politics. Broadly, Ward&#x27;s overarching project represented the &quot;monumental exposition of the relation of the state to social progress&quot; Working from the perspective that social research could be used to improve policy and the function of government, Ward was noted by his contemporaries for engaging in &quot;the most advanced views yet taken by an avowed sociologist in the advocacy of a comprehensive program of social reform through the medium of legislation&quot;.

During this time, Ward was very productive in writing and circulating works on his interests concerning nature and society. Ward published his &quot;Guide to the flora of Washington and vicinity&quot; (1881), followed shortly afterwards by the first volume of &quot;Dynamic Sociology: Or applied social science as based upon statistical sociology and the less complex sciences&quot; (1883), alongside his &quot;Sketch of Paleobotany&quot; (1885), &quot;Synopsis of the Flora of the Laramie Group&quot; (1885), and &quot;Types of the Laramie Flora&quot; (1887).

===Gaining notability===
Reflecting his growing prominence as a scholar and acceptance in academic circles, Ward was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1889. In 1900, he was elected as the president of International Institute of Sociology in France. Ward was also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

From 1891 to 1905, Ward continued to publish numerous texts on natural history and sociology, with the circulation of his work in both areas contributing to his growing notability. These works included sociological writings on &quot;Neo-Darwinism and Neo-Lamarckism&quot; (1891), &quot;The Psychic Factors of Civilization&quot; (1893), multiple articles in &quot;Contributions to Social Philosophy&quot; (1895–1897), the second volume of his &quot;Dynamic Sociology&quot; (1897), and his &quot;Outlines of Sociology&quot; (1898).

===The founding of the American Sociological Association: 1905===
In 1905, American sociologists debated the creation of an independent professional association that would be distinct from other existing collectives for historians, economists, and political scientists. C. W. A. Veditz, a professor at George Washington University who admired Ward&#x27;s work, sought Ward&#x27;s opinion on the matter, with Ward arguing in favor of an organization that could mirror Paris&#x27; International Institute of Sociology.

At a meeting of approximately three hundred sociologists at the December 27th 1905 American Economic Association, Ward made a strong argument for the establishment of the American Sociological Association, with the assembled sociologists passing Ward&#x27;s motion and forming a committee to establish the association&#x27;s charter and founding officers. Ward became the first president of the American Sociological Association on December 28, 1905, after his colleauges Ross, Small, and Giddings motioned for him to receive the honor. Ward was chosen for the role out of a belief among the committee that &quot;all sociologists are under a heavy debt of gratitude&quot; to his work, and because of Ward&#x27;s commitment to raise the discipline&#x27;s profile and esteem in a society where sociology was &quot;not merely discredited, but almost entirely unknown&quot;.

===Teaching at Brown and final years: 1906–1913===
After becoming the first president of the American Sociological Association, Ward&#x27;s reputation and prominence as a sociologist in America was at its peak. In 1906, Ward became chair of sociology at Brown University. Previously, Ward had given &quot;extended courses of lectures on sociology&quot; at the University of Chicago and at Stanford University.

Prior to taking up the position at Brown, Ward and his wife travelled to Europe and Ward took part in various presentations and debates. Ward was popular at Brown, as a teacher and colleauge; a fellow professor, Samuel Mitchell, described him as &quot;pre-eminent&quot; among the &quot;many able scholars and teachers&quot; at Brown. One of Ward&#x27;s students, Sara Algeo, wrote that &quot;studying with Prof. Ward was like sitting at the feet of Aristotle, or Plato ... He was the wisest man I have ever known.&quot; In 1910, Ward taught at the University of Wisconsin Madison&#x27;s sociology department during their summer school

Ward delivered public lectures and seminars in the United Kingdom and across the United States. Towards the end of his life, Ward critiqued the eugenics movement as founded on a &quot;distrust of nature&quot; and &quot;egotism&quot;, and instead argued that a program of social welfare (or &#x27;euthenics&#x27;) would be far more effective in curing social ills than what was proposed by eugenicists.

Despite gaining recognition for his work and professional esteem, Ward felt increasingly isolated in this later stage of his career as his focus on systematization was at odds with the work of other social scientists who were more focused on policy and legislation. During his later years, Ward remained a productive writer. In 1906 Ward published &quot;Applied Sociology: A Treatise on the Conscious Improvement of Society by Society&quot;, and in 1908 an article on &quot;Social Classes in the Light of Modern Sociological Theory&quot; followed in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot;. Ward&#x27;s final major work, &quot;Glimpses of the Cosmos&quot;, was published posthumously, with the help of Sarah Comstock and Sarah Simons, in six volumes beginning in 1913 and continuing until 1918.

===Death: 1913===
After several weeks of sickness, Ward died on April 17, 1913 at his home on Rhode Island Avenue. Prominent social scientists including Emile Durkheim, Ferdinand Tonnies, Patrick Geddes, Thorstein Veblen, and Albion Small mourned his death. His colleagues at Brown University eulogized Ward as a &quot;profound student, and an original investigator in the most abstruse problems which the human mind can grapple&quot;, describing him as &quot;a genial associate&quot; and &quot;an inspiring teacher&quot;. In a eulogy in the Washington Herald, C. W. A. Veditz remarked that &quot;his death marks the disappearance of a scientists who will unquestionably rank as one of the half-dozen greatest thinkers in his field that the world has produced&quot;

Ward was first buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Washington, but was later moved to Brookside Cemetery, Watertown in Jefferson County, New York to be with his wife. The only surviving public memorial commemorating Ward is in the Pennsylvania village of Myersburg, where a state historical sign describes Ward as &quot;the American Aristotle&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
While attending the Susquehanna Collegiate Institute, Ward met Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Carolyn Vought and fell in love. They married on August 13, 1862. Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the Union Army and was sent to the Civil War front. After the war he successfully petitioned for work with the federal government in Washington, DC, where the couple moved.

Lizzie assisted him in editing and contributing to a newsletter called &quot;The Iconoclast&quot;, dedicated to free thinking and critiquing organized religion. She gave birth to a son, but the child died when he was less than a year old. Lizzie died in 1872 at the age of thirty. Lester Frank Ward went on to marry Rosamond Asenath Simons (1840–1913) as his second wife in the year 1873.

===Personal Character===
Reflecting after his death, James Q. Dealey, one of Ward&#x27;s friends, wrote that Ward &quot;had a deeply emotional nature&quot; which was &quot;suppressed by his close devotion to intellectual pursuits&quot;, while he was &quot;really fond of social life&quot; he became &quot;so absorbed in his work that to a quite large extent he lived a lonely life during his last years&quot; and rarely socialized away from his university connections. Dealey described Ward as a committed teacher who &quot;was seldom absent from his classes&quot; and &quot;was most systematic in the preparation of his lectures&quot;, even towards the end of his life when &quot;he could barely put one foot before another and could hardly carry the weight of his books&quot;, Ward cherished teaching.

Emily Palmer Cape wrote that Ward &quot;always stressed the power of an education which teaches a knowledge of the materials and forces of nature, and their relation to our own lives.&quot; Cape noted that Ward &quot;loved nature, and to be out of doors&quot; and enjoyed giving &quot;a long and beautiful description of the earth&quot; whenever possible.

===Family===
Ward&#x27;s immediate family were politically active and involved in various social causes. Lester Ward&#x27;s older brother, Cyrenus Ward, was &quot;heavily involved in the politics of labor unions and working-class reform&quot; and in the middle of the 1860s he became a leading member of the socialist movement in New York City. Cyrenus Ward went on to join Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, to which he was elected a council member, before being arrested as a spy during the Franco-Prussian War. Lester Ward detailed Cyrenus&#x27; activities in &quot;The Iconoclast&quot;, and went on to secure jobs for him at the Geological Survey and the Bureau of Statistics via his network in Washington. Lester Ward&#x27;s other brothers, Lorenzo and Justin, were both politically active in the cooperative movement and the prohibitionist movement respectively.

Ward hoped to use his scientific literacy to contribute an American version of historical-materialist Sociology, opposing the then popular work of Herbert Spencer with critique inspired by Karl Marx. Working in the Enlightenment tradition, Ward associated his project with the advancement of democratic principles in the United States. As Ward explained in the Preface to &quot;Dynamic Sociology: Or Applied Social Science as Based Upon Statistical Sociology and the Less Complex Sciences&quot;, it was his belief that: &quot;The real object of science is to benefit man. A science which fails to do this, however agreeable its study, is lifeless. Sociology, which of all sciences should benefit man most, is in danger of falling into the class of polite amusements, or dead sciences. It is the object of this work to point out a method by which the breath of life may be breathed into its nostrils.&quot;

===Political beliefs===
Ward approached society through the lens of producerism, or the celebration of productive workers, for example artisans, skilled laborers, merchants, and craftspeople, as opposed to nonproducers who simply accumulated capital and resources., Ward believed that government should provide society with understanding of socioeconomic conditions to ensure that the state progressed as a whole. Ward was critical of &quot;privilege, monopoly, and the evils of financial capitalism&quot;, and supported abolitionism, temperance, and public education.

===Nature, evolution and conservation===
Ward had a lifelong interest in nature, beginning in childhood and extending throughout his time as a government clerk active in local biological societies, and as a formally trained paleobiologist. Ward engaged with Lamarckian ideas, or the theory that the natural environment shapes organisms. Ward wrote on the topic in &quot;Neo-Darwinism and Neo-Lamarckism&quot;, and was enthusiastic in his support of Darwin&#x27;s findings and theories.

Reflecting a popular trend at the time, Ward made connections between evolution, patterns in the natural world, and his perspectives on society. Ward wrote that &quot;the process of evolution is organization&quot;, reflecting that in his opinion &quot;the process is the same&quot; across biological, chemical, physical, and social forms of organization. Ward believed that &quot;the universal comprehension of nature&quot; would lead to a situation where &quot;every human could do his part&quot;, stressing that recognising this interconnectedness and interdependence &quot;should inspire one to add to the whole&quot; and to &quot;contribute one&#x27;s share ot life&#x27;s great continuous flow.&quot;

Ward understood human conflict and war as evolutionary forces responsible for progress. From Ward&#x27;s perspective, conflict enabled the rise of Homo Sapiens over other creatures, and saw the expansion of what he considered to be more technologically advanced races and nations. Ward saw war as a natural evolutionary process that could be painful, slow, and ineffective. He argued to recognize these characteristics of war, but to replace it with a more progressive system which minimized harm.

He wrote: 
Alongside George Perkins Marsh, John Wesley Powell, and W J McGee, Ward&#x27;s ideas concerning conservation and the management of natural resources helped to inform the conservation movement of the early 20th century. However, the extent of Ward&#x27;s contributions to scientific understandings of nature has been debated, with John Burnham writing that &quot;Ward&#x27;s unbelievable egotism and his ostentatious display of technical terminology misled many writers into believing he was a &quot;great&quot; or &quot;distinguished&quot; natural scientist.&quot; Ward&#x27;s desire to &quot;prove his knowledge of all scientific subjects&quot;, and his &quot;habit of creating difficult neologisms in his books&quot; proved to be &quot;particularly bothersome to many readers of his work&quot;.

===Welfare state and laissez faire===
Ward was a supporter of the concept of the welfare state. Ward argued that those critical of the development of a social safety as &#x27;paternalistic&#x27; were hypocritical for themselves receiving &quot;relief from their own incompetency&quot; in their private enterprise as capitalists and industrialists. Ward&#x27;s ideas influenced a rising generation of progressive political leaders, such as Herbert Croly, and his ideas came to help shape early welfare policy in the United States. However, there are few demonstrable direct links between his writings and the actual programs of the founders of the welfare state and the New Deal.

Reflecting his overarching engagement with discussions of evolution, Ward critiqued Herbert Spencer and Spencer&#x27;s theories of laissez-faire and survival of the fittest which were popular in socio-economic thought in the United States after the American Civil War. Ward positioned himself in opposition to Spencer and the American political scientist William Graham Sumner, an advocate for Spencer&#x27;s ideas, who had promoted the principles of laissez-faire. The historian Henry Steele Commager argued that Ward &quot;trained his heaviest guns&quot; on &quot;the superstitions that still held domain over the mid of his generation&quot;, of which &quot;laissez-faire was the most stupefying&quot;

===Women&#x27;s equality===
Ward advocated for equal rights for women, at times drawing on metaphors and analogies from his interest in the study of the natural world to support his arguments. He gave a speech on the topic to the Fourteenth Dinner of the Six O’clock Club in Washington on April 26, 1888, at Willard’s Hotel. Ward was of the opinion that &quot;there is no fixed rule by which Nature has intended that one sex should excel the other, any more than there is any fixed point beyond which either cannot develop.&quot; Ward summarized his position as &quot;true science teaches that the elevation of woman is the only sure road to the evolution of man.&quot; Despite Ward&#x27;s interest in the topic of equal rights for women, Clifford H. Scott summarised that &quot;practically all the suffragists ignored&quot; Ward.

==Legacy in American sociology==
As Robert Kessler summarized, &quot;reputation came slowly and faded rapidly&quot; for Ward, while his early work was &quot;epoch-making&quot; and his impact led to Hofstadter naming him the &quot;American Aristotle&quot;, by the middle of the 20th century Ward had &quot;passed so completely from the contemporary scene&quot; and is now largely undiscussed in modern American sociology. Eric Royal Lybeck argues that the broadness of Ward&#x27;s research was responsible for his work being &quot;shunted from the centre of sociological discourse to the margins of posterity&quot; While Ward&#x27;s work was wide sweeping and attempted to synthesize insights from a broad spectrum of research themes and subjects, the institutionalization of sociology in the United States led to a hyperfocus on discrete and specialized problems which was at odds with the scale of his approach. Albion Small suggested that Ward remained too attached to the positivism of Auguste Comte and the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer at a time when other social scientists were moving towards other social models and methods of analysis. It was Small&#x27;s assessment that Ward clung to a &quot;pure science&quot; approach in social research, and was more of a &quot;museum investigator&quot; interested in labeling, categorising, and developing schema.
Cumulatively, this meant that while Ward was &quot;highly regarded and influential&quot; in the early history of sociology in the United States, his approach and contributions rapidly became redundant as the field changed.

Even during his lifetime, C. W. A. Veditz suggested that due to translation and wide circulation, Ward&#x27;s works may have been better known in Germany, France, Switzerland, Russia, and Japan than they were in the United States.

== Ward&#x27;s diaries, writings, and photographs ==
All but the first of his voluminous diaries were reportedly destroyed by Rosamond after his death. Ward&#x27;s first journal, &quot;Young Ward&#x27;s Diary: A Human and Eager Record of the Years Between 1860 and 1870...&quot;, remains under copyright. A collection of Ward&#x27;s writings and photographs is maintained by the Special Collections Research Center of the George Washington University. The collection includes articles, diaries, correspondence, and a scrapbook. GWU&#x27;s Special Collections Research Center is located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.

<text>The Okotoks Dawgs are a collegiate summer baseball team based in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada. They play in the Western Canadian Baseball League (WCBL). The Dawgs are eight-time WCBL champions.

==History==
The Dawgs were originally based in Calgary where they were known as the Calgary Dawgs. The roots of the team date to 1996 (as shown in the team&#x27;s logo) &quot;with the formation of an elite youth travel team&quot;. The Dawgs joined the WCBL in 2003, playing at Foothills Stadium. They won the 2004 league championship in front of over 3,400 fans. The arrival of the professional Calgary Vipers in 2005 led to numerous bitter conflicts between the two clubs over use of the stadium, and ultimately forced the Dawgs to suspend operations for the 2006 season.

The franchise resumed operations in 2007 in the town of Okotoks, 18 kilometres south of Calgary, after brothers Don and Doc Seaman funded the construction of Seaman Stadium at the cost of $8 million. The team has been a huge success in Okotoks. Their average of 1,825 fans per game in 2008 was the most of any baseball team in Alberta and made them the top drawing collegiate team in Canada. Attendance steadily increased to an estimated 2,400 per game by 2011, which team director John Ircandia attributed to the community&#x27;s enthusiastic support, noting that games &quot;kind of became a place to see your neighbours again.&quot; In 2019, the team attracted an average of 3,937 fans per game, the third-highest in all of Summer Collegiate baseball. 

The organization operates several high performance teams at the under-18 and under-15 levels. Since their arrival in Okotoks, the community has seen a significant increase in participation in minor baseball, growing from 150 registered players in 2006 to over 500 in 2011.

The Dawgs have been equally successful on the field since their move to Okotoks, capturing the 2007, 2008, 2009, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024 championships.

<text>Angelica pubescens is a plant in the family Apiaceae, native to Japan and Taiwan. The Japanese common name is shishiudo. In Mainland China, the plant under the name &quot;Angelica pubescens&quot; is actually &quot;Angelica biserrata&quot;.

It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 1–2 m tall with tripinnate leaves up to 1 m long, the leaflets being 5–10 cm long. The flowers are white, produced in large umbels.

The young stems and leaves are edible. Shishiudo is often mistaken with udo.
