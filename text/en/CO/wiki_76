<text>The cycle of abuse is a social cycle theory developed in 1979 by Lenore E. Walker to explain patterns of behavior in an abusive relationship. The phrase is also used more generally to describe any set of conditions which perpetuate abusive and dysfunctional relationships, such as abusive child rearing practices which tend to get passed down. Walker used the term more narrowly, to describe the cycling patterns of calm, violence, and reconciliation within an abusive relationship. Critics suggest the theory was based on inadequate research criteria, and cannot therefore be generalized upon.

==Overview==
Lenore E. Walker interviewed 1,500 women who had been subject to domestic violence and found that there was a similar pattern of abuse, called the &quot;cycle of abuse&quot;. Initially, Walker proposed that the cycle of abuse described the controlling patriarchal behavior of men who felt entitled to abuse their wives to maintain control over them. She used the terms &quot;the battering cycle&quot; and &quot;battered woman syndrome&quot;. Terms like &quot;cycle of abuse&quot; have been used instead for different reasons: to maintain objectivity; because the cycle of abuse doesn&#x27;t always lead to physical abuse; because symptoms of the syndrome have been observed in men and women, and are not confined to marriage and dating. Similarly, Dutton (1994) writes, &quot;The prevalence of violence in homosexual relationships, which also appear to go through abuse cycles is hard to explain in terms of men dominating women.&quot;

The cycle of abuse concept is widely used in domestic violence programs, particularly in the United States. Critics have argued the theory is flawed as it does not apply as universally as Walker suggested, does not accurately or completely describe all abusive relationships, and may emphasize ideological presumptions rather than empirical data.

==Phases==
The cycle usually goes in the following order, and will repeat until the conflict is stopped, usually by the survivor entirely abandoning the relationship or some form of intervention. The cycle can occur hundreds of times in an abusive relationship, the total cycle taking anywhere from a few hours to a year or more to complete. However, the length of the cycle usually diminishes over time so that the &quot;reconciliation&quot; and &quot;calm&quot; stages may disappear, violence becomes more intense and the cycles become more frequent.

===1: Tension building===
Stress builds from the pressures of daily life, like conflict over children, marital issues, misunderstandings, or other family conflicts. It also builds as the result of illness, legal or financial problems, unemployment, or catastrophic events, like floods, rape or war. During this period, the abuser feels ignored, threatened, annoyed or wronged. The feeling lasts on average several minutes to hours, although it may last as long as several months.

To prevent violence, the victim may try to reduce the tension by becoming compliant and nurturing. Alternatively, the victim may provoke the abuser to get the abuse over with, prepare for the violence or lessen the degree of injury. However, the abuser is never justified in engaging in violent or abusive behavior.

===2: Incident ===
During this stage, the abuser attempts to dominate their victim. Outbursts of violence and abuse occur which may include verbal abuse and psychological abuse.

In intimate partner violence, children are negatively affected by having witnessed the violence, and the partner&#x27;s relationship degrades as well. The release of energy reduces the tension, and the abuser may feel or express that the victim &quot;had it coming&quot; to them.

===3: Reconciliation===
The perpetrator may begin to feel remorse, guilty feelings, or fear that their partner will leave or call the police. The victim feels pain, fear, humiliation, disrespect, confusion, and may mistakenly feel responsible.

Characterized by affection, apology, or, alternatively, ignoring the incident, this phase marks an apparent end of violence, with assurances that it will never happen again, or that the abuser will do their best to change. During this stage the abuser may feel or claim to feel overwhelming remorse and sadness. Some abusers walk away from the situation with little comment, but most will eventually shower the survivor with love and affection. The abuser may use self-harm or threats of suicide to gain sympathy and/or prevent the survivor from leaving the relationship. Abusers are frequently so convincing, and survivors so eager for the relationship to improve, that survivors (who are often worn down and confused by longstanding abuse) stay in the relationship.

===4: Calm===
During this phase (which is often considered an element of the honeymoon/reconciliation phase), the relationship is relatively calm and peaceful. During this period the abuser may agree to engage in counselling, ask for forgiveness, and create a normal atmosphere. In intimate partner relationships, the perpetrator may buy presents or the couple may engage in passionate sex. Over time, the abuser&#x27;s apologies and requests for forgiveness become less sincere and are generally stated to prevent separation or intervention. However, interpersonal difficulties will inevitably arise, leading again to the tension building phase. The effect of the continual cycle may include loss of love, contempt, distress, and/or physical disability. Intimate partners may separate, divorce or, at the extreme, someone may be killed.

==Critiques==
Walker&#x27;s cycle of abuse theory was regarded as a revolutionary and important concept in the study of abuse and interpersonal violence, which is a useful model, but may be simplistic. For instance, Scott Allen Johnson developed a 14-stage cycle that broke down the tension-building, acting-out and calm stages further. For instance, there are six stages in the &quot;escalation&quot; or tension building stage. These lead up to the assault by acting out the revenge plan, self-destructive behavior, victim grooming and the actual physical and/or sexual assault. This is followed by a sense of relief, fear of consequences, distraction, and rationalization of abuse.

Donald Dutton and Susan Golant agree that Walker&#x27;s cycle of abuse accurately describes all cyclically abusive relationships they studied. Nonetheless, they also note that her initial research was based almost entirely on anecdotal data from a rather small set of women who were in violent relationships. Walker herself wrote, &quot;These women were not randomly selected and they cannot be considered a legitimate data base from which to make specific generalizations.&quot;

<text>Renaud de Courtenay, (d. 1160) was seigneur of Courtenay and fought in the Second Crusade with Louis VII of France. His fate is unknown, either losing his lands from an argument with Louis VII or dying on crusade and his lands going to his daughter Elizabeth&#x27;s husband, Peter.

==Life==
Renaud was the son of Miles (Milo) de Courtenay, Seigneur of Courtenay and his wife Ermengard de Nevers. He succeeded his father as Seigneur of Courtenay and fought in the Second Crusade with King Louis VII of France.

According to Suger, Renaud argued with King Louis VII, who seized Renaud&#x27;s possessions and gave them to his youngest brother, Pierre (Peter) of France, who thenceforth became known as Peter I of Courtenay. Nicholas Vincent states that Renaud in all probability died on crusade and that his daughter Elizabeth married Peter who inherited Courtenay lands.

==Marriages and issue==
Renaud and his first wife Helvise du Donjon had:

* Renaud II de Courtenay, (b. 1125 - d. 27 September 1194) who in 1172, accompanied King Henry II of England on the Irish Expedition to Wexford. He married Hawise de Curcy (d.1219), heiress of the feudal barony of Okehampton in Devon, and half sister to his father&#x27;s second wife, Maud du Sap. Through the marriage, he acquired Okehampton Castle. 
* Elizabeth de Courtenay (b. 1127 - d. September 1205), who was given in marriage by the French King Louis VII (d.1180) to his youngest brother, Peter of France (d.1183), who thenceforth became known as &quot;Peter I of Courtenay&quot;.
* Adeline de Courtenay married Avalon de Seignelay
* Guillaume de Courtenay married Matilda daughter of Robert FitzEdith and Mathilde d’Avranches.

Renaud and his second wife Hawise d’Avranches had:
* Robert de Courtenay married Matilda FitzUrse
* Egeline de Courtenay married Gilbert Basset

<text>Danse macabre, Op. 40, is a symphonic poem for orchestra, written in 1874 by the French composer Camille Saint-Saëns. It premiered 24 January 1875. It is in the key of G minor. It started out in 1872 as an art song for voice and piano with a French text by the poet Henri Cazalis. In 1874, the composer expanded and reworked the piece into a symphonic poem, replacing the vocal line with a solo violin part.

==Analysis==

According to legend, Death appears at midnight every year on Halloween. Death calls forth the dead from their graves to dance for him while he plays his fiddle (here represented by a solo violin). His skeletons dance for him until the cockerel crows at dawn, when they must return to their graves until the next year.

The piece opens with a harp playing a single note, D, twelve times (the twelve strokes of midnight) which is accompanied by soft chords from the string section. The solo violin enters playing the tritone, which was known as the &quot;diabolus in musica&quot; (&quot;the Devil in music&quot;) during the Medieval and Baroque eras, consisting of an A and an E—in an example of scordatura tuning, the violinist&#x27;s E string has actually been tuned down to an E to create the dissonant tritone.

The first theme is heard on a solo flute, followed by the second theme, a descending scale on the solo violin which is accompanied by soft chords from the string section. The first and second themes, or fragments of them, are then heard throughout the various sections of the orchestra. The piece becomes more energetic and at its midpoint, right after a contrapuntal section based on the second theme, there is a direct quote played by the woodwinds of &quot;Dies irae&quot;, a Gregorian chant from the Requiem that is melodically related to the work&#x27;s second theme. The &quot;Dies irae&quot; is presented unusually in a major key. After this section the piece returns to the first and second themes and climaxes with the full orchestra playing very strong dynamics. Then there is an abrupt break in the texture and the coda represents the dawn breaking (a cockerel&#x27;s crow, played by the oboe) and the skeletons returning to their graves.

The piece makes particular use of the xylophone to imitate the sounds of rattling bones. Saint-Saëns uses a similar motif in the &quot;Fossils&quot; movement of &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;.

The progression and melody of the minor waltz are similar to the jibes (e.g. &quot;their sweethearts all are dead&quot;) of the Sailors&#x27; Chorus in &quot;Helmsman/Steersman, Leave Your Watch,&quot; which begins the third act of Wagner&#x27;s earlier opera, &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;.

==Instrumentation==
&quot;Danse macabre&quot; is scored for an obbligato violin and an orchestra consisting of one piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B, two bassoons; four horns in G and D, two trumpets in D, three trombones, one tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, xylophone, bass drum, cymbals and triangle; one harp and strings.

==Reception==
When &quot;Danse macabre&quot; was first performed on 24 January 1875, it was not well received and caused widespread feelings of anxiety. The 21st century scholar, Roger Nichols, mentions adverse reaction to &quot;the deformed &quot;Dies irae&quot; plainsong&quot;, the &quot;horrible screeching from solo violin&quot;, the use of a xylophone, and &quot;the hypnotic repetitions&quot;, in which Nichols hears a pre-echo of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;.

It has grown to be considered one of Saint-Saëns&#x27; masterpieces, widely regarded and reproduced in both high and popular culture.

==Transcriptions==
Shortly after the premiere, the piece was transcribed into a piano solo arrangement by Franz Liszt (S.555), a good friend of Saint-Saëns. Next to countless other piano solo transcriptions, Ernest Guiraud wrote a version for piano four hands and Saint-Saëns himself wrote a version for two pianos, and in 1877 also a version for violin and piano. In 1942, Vladimir Horowitz made extensive changes to the Liszt transcription. This version is played most often today.

There is an arrangement for Pierrot ensemble (flute, clarinet, violin, cello, piano) by Tim Mulleman, and an organ transcription by Edwin Lemare. Greg Anderson created a version for two pianos, two percussionists and violin, which he titled &quot;Danse Macbre Baccanale&quot;.

<text>Totentanz (): Paraphrase on &quot;Dies irae&quot;, S.126, is the name of a work for solo piano and orchestra by Franz Liszt notable for being based on the Gregorian plainchant melody &quot;Dies irae&quot; as well as for stylistic innovations. It was first planned in 1838, completed and published in 1849, and revised in 1853 and 1859.

== Obsession with death ==
Some of the titles of Liszt’s pieces, such as &quot;Totentanz&quot;, &quot;Funérailles&quot;, &quot;La lugubre gondola&quot; and &quot;Pensée des morts&quot;, show the composer&#x27;s fascination with death. In the young Liszt we can already observe manifestations of his obsession with death, with religion, and with heaven and hell. According to Alan Walker, Liszt frequented Parisian &quot;hospitals, gambling casinos and asylums&quot; in the early 1830s, and he even went down into prison dungeons in order to see those condemned to die.

== Sources of inspiration ==
In the Romantic age, due to a fascination with everything Medieval, the aspect of fantastic or grotesquely macabre irony often replaced the original moral intent. A musical example of such irony can be found in the last movement of the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; by Hector Berlioz which quotes the medieval (Gregorian) &quot;Dies Irae&quot; (Day of Judgment) melody in a shockingly modernistic manner. In 1830 Liszt attended the first performance of the symphony and was struck by its powerful originality. Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Totentanz&quot; (Dance of Death), a set of variations for piano and orchestra, also paraphrases the &quot;Dies Irae&quot; plainsong.

Another source of inspiration for the young Liszt was the famous fresco &quot;Triumph of Death&quot; by Francesco Traini (at Liszt&#x27;s time attributed to Andrea Orcagna and today also to Buonamico Buffalmacco) in the Campo Santo, Pisa. Liszt had eloped to Italy with his mistress, the Countess d’Agoult, and in 1838 he visited Pisa. Only ten years later, Liszt&#x27;s first sketches materialized into a complete version of his &quot;Totentanz&quot;. Revisions followed in 1853 and 1859, and its final form was first performed at The Hague on 15 April 1865 by Liszt&#x27;s student Hans von Bülow, to whom the work is dedicated.

== Stylistic innovations ==
Since it is based on Gregorian material, Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Totentanz&quot; contains Medieval sounding passages with canonic counterpoint, but by far the most innovative aspect of the scoring is the shockingly modernistic, even percussive, nature of the piano part. The opening comes surprisingly close to the introduction in Bartók&#x27;s Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, a work composed almost a hundred years later. This may be no coincidence since Bartók frequently performed Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Totentanz&quot;. Other modernistic features are the toccata like sections where the pianist&#x27;s repeated notes beat with diabolic intensity and special sound effects in the orchestra—for example, the &quot;col legno&quot; in the strings sound like shuddering or clanking bones. Richard Pohl (an early biographer) notes, &quot;Every variation discloses some new character—the earnest man, the flighty youth, the scornful doubter, the prayerful monk, the daring soldier, the tender maiden, the playful child.&quot;

== Extant versions ==
Like most Liszt pieces, a number of versions exist. Next to Liszt&#x27;s first version of the &quot;Totentanz&quot; a second &quot;De Profundis&quot; version was prepared from Liszt&#x27;s manuscript sources by Ferruccio Busoni (1919). The standard version is the final and third version of the piece (1859). Liszt also wrote versions for two pianos (S.652) and solo piano (S.525). Edited by Emil von Sauer, the original edition for two pianos, however, merely incorporated the solo part of Liszt&#x27;s rendering for piano and orchestra, with a transcription of the orchestral accompaniment in the second piano. Dr. Andrey Kasparov has since re-imagined this setting as a work for piano duo. It shows to great effect the breadth of the &quot;Totentanz&quot;, when distributed evenly between two performers.

Stephen Tharp has transcribed the work for solo organ. 

== Notable performers ==
Besides the performances by Hans von Bülow, Béla Bartók, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Ferruccio Busoni, performances of historic significance include those of the Liszt student José Vianna da Motta (1945 – Port Nat S IPL 108), as well as György Cziffra (EMI 74012 2), Claudio Arrau, Jorge Bolet (Decca), Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli (1961 – Arkadia HP 507.1; 1962 – Memoria 999-001), Michel Béroff (EMI Classics), Byron Janis (RCA), Martha Argerich, Krystian Zimerman (Deutsche Grammophon), Arnaldo Cohen (Naxos and BIS), Raymond Lewenthal, and Enrico Pace at the Second International Franz Liszt Piano Competition in 1989.

<text>Margot Cathleen James (born 28 August 1957) is a British politician who served as Minister of State for Digital and Creative Industries from 2018 to 2019. She was Member of Parliament (MP) for Stourbridge from 2010 to 2019. Elected as a Conservative, she had the whip removed in September 2019 and, after having the whip restored, stood down as an MP prior to the upcoming general election.

==Early life==
The younger daughter of a self-made businessman, James was born in Coventry. Educated privately in Leamington Spa, she then attended the sixth form at Millfield School in Street, Somerset. James is a graduate of the London School of Economics (LSE) with a degree in Economics and Government.

James joined the Conservative Party aged 17, and chaired the LSE Conservative Association. During her studies, she acted as a researcher for MP Sir Anthony Durant, and after graduation spent a gap year working in the press office of Conservative Central Office.

==Professional career==
James worked in sales and marketing for her father&#x27;s business, Maurice James Industries (MJI), a haulage, waste management, and property group based around Birmingham. After working for a consulting firm, in 1986 she co-founded Shire Health Group, a public relations and clinical trials organisation. Shire Health was voted &quot;Consultancy of the Year&quot; three times in the Communiqué Awards for 1998, 1999 and 2001, while James was voted Communicator of the Year in 1997. The company was sold to WPP Group in 2004, with James appointed Head of European Healthcare for WPP subsidiary Ogilvy &amp; Mather.

==Political career==
James had resigned from the Conservative Party after Margaret Thatcher was ousted as Prime Minister. She rejoined the Conservative Party early in 2003.

At the May 2005 general election, she was the Conservative candidate for the Holborn and St. Pancras constituency; James was the first ever openly lesbian Conservative candidate to stand in a British general election. She came third behind the sitting MP, Labour&#x27;s Frank Dobson, and the Liberal Democrat candidate Jill Fraser.

In May 2006, James was elected a local councillor for the Brompton ward of Kensington &amp; Chelsea, becoming one of the Conservative Party&#x27;s few &quot;out&quot; lesbian office holders. She resigned from the council in 2008.

James was placed on the &quot;A-List&quot; of Conservative Party parliamentary candidates ahead of the 2010 general election, and was selected as the candidate for the marginal Labour-held constituency of Stourbridge, from where she was elected. This made her the first openly lesbian MP in the Conservative Party, second &quot;out&quot; lesbian in the House of Commons, after Angela Eagle, and the first to have come out before her election. In her maiden speech she paid tribute to Stourbridge&#x27;s history of glass making.

She was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Stephen Green, Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint, during his period as Minister for Trade and Investment from 2011 to 2013. From 2014 to 2015, James served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to William Hague, the then Leader of the House of Commons.

In January 2016, the Labour Party unsuccessfully proposed an amendment in Parliament that would have required private landlords to make their homes &quot;fit for human habitation&quot;. According to Parliament&#x27;s register of interests, James was one of 72 Conservative MPs who voted against the amendment who personally derived an income from renting out property. The Conservative Government had responded to the amendment that they believed homes should be fit for human habitation but did not want to pass the new law that would explicitly require it.

James was opposed to leaving the European Union prior to the 2016 referendum.

James was made Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Small Business, Consumers and Corporate Responsibility at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy by Theresa May, in her first ministry in July 2016.

James served as Minister of State for Digital and the Creative Industries from 9 January 2018, resigning on 18 July 2019 to vote against the Government on an amendment; rebelling in an attempt to prevent the prorogation of Parliament which could have been used to force through a no-deal Brexit.

James endorsed Rory Stewart during the 2019 Conservative leadership election.

James had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September 2019. On 29 October 2019, she was one of ten Conservative MPs to have the whip restored, but announced on 3 November her intention to stand down as an MP at the 2019 general election, following disagreements with her local party.

==Other activities==
James served on the board of Parkside NHS Trust, and worked as a Mental Health Manager. She spent ten years as a trustee of ABANTU, an African women&#x27;s charity, during which time she trained women from more than 40 different African countries in communications and lobbying skills. She has also worked as a mentor for The Prince&#x27;s Trust and Young Enterprise. She sits on the Court of Governors at LSE.

She is a vice-president of the Debating Group. and in 2019, was named the 50th &#x27;Most Influential Woman in UK Tech&#x27; by Computer Weekly magazine.

==Personal life==
James lives in South Kensington and Stourbridge with her partner, Jay Hunt, previously a producer and presenter with the BBC and now managing director of a video production company, Violet Productions. She ranked in the top 50 on &quot;The Independent&quot;″s &quot;Pink List&quot; of the 101 most influential British gay men and women in 2009.

<doc id="1299641" wikidata="Q4896473" url="?curid=1299641" title="The Caravans">
<text>The Caravans were an American gospel music group that was started in 1947 by Robert Anderson. It reached its peak popularity during the 1950s and 1960s, launching the careers of a number of artists, including: Delores Washington, Albertina Walker, Bessie Griffin, Cassietta George, Dorothy Norwood, Inez Andrews, Shirley Caesar and the Rev. James Cleveland, among others. 

The group underwent numerous personnel changes between 1951 and 1961. The years 1962 to 1966 provided the Caravans with its most stable group member lineup, consisting of Washington, Walker, Caesar, George, James Herndon and Josephine Howard. The group also made frequent TV appearances during this time on shows such as TV Gospel Time and Jubilee Showcase.

==Founding==

The Caravans were founded in 1947 under the name Robert Anderson and his Gospel Caravan by Robert Anderson in Chicago, Illinois to serve as Anderson&#x27;s backing vocalists. The group consisted of Ora Lee Hopkins, Elyse Yancey, Irma Gwynn, Edward Robinson, the pianist, and Louise Overall Weaver as their organist. Their recordings between 1949 and 1951 were made under the names of Robert Anderson and Choir, Anderson Singers with Robert Anderson, Anderson Singers, and Robert Anderson and his Gospel Caravan.

In 1952, Gwynn left the group, a slight change of the group&#x27;s name to Robert Anderson and The Caravans was made, and Nellie Grace Daniels and Albertina Walker joined the group. The group featuring Walker and Daniels under their new name made their first and only recording on April 18, 1952. During this recording session, a sequence of events happened, resulting in Robert Anderson parting ways with his background singers. Walker, Hopkins, Yancey, and Daniels and Lelia M.Davidson of New Jersey came into the group recorded the remainder of their tracks, and adopted the group name of The Caravans simply by dropping Robert Anderson&#x27;s name from the group name. Walker was the featured singer on the albums which the newly emancipated Caravans made. 

That changed, however, as other singers joined the group, which retained the close harmonies and precise rhythms of the original group, but now allowed each member the opportunity to solo on alternating leads. At their height in the late 1950s the Caravans combined the alto of Shirley Caesar on songs such as &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; with the contralto of Inez Andrews on &quot;Mary Don&#x27;t You Weep&quot;, the soprano of Delores Washington, and the frenetic piano style of Eddie Williams. 

Bessie Griffin joined the group in 1953, but left after a year. Cassietta George also joined in 1953 and stayed for two years, but returned in 1960 to stay for another year before rejoining in 1962 and staying for another four years. Norwood joined in 1955 and left in 1957, forming her own group, the Norwood Singers. Inez Andrews joined, at the suggestion of James Cleveland, the pianist and arranger for the group, in 1957 and left in 1962 to form her own group, the Andrewettes (a.k.a. The Gospel Challengers of Jamaica, New York). Andrews returned in 1966, only to depart again and go solo in 1967. Caesar had joineded the Caravans in 1958 and left to pursue a solo career in 1966.

==Later years==

Albertina Walker recently recorded a reunion album with her group The Caravans entitled &quot;Paved The Way&quot;, which was released by Malaco Records on September 5, 2006. This was the group&#x27;s first new recording since 1976. The group consisted of Walker, Norwood, Andrews, Washington, and special guest Evelyn Turrentine-Agee. The album was dubbed by &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine as one of the most memorable releases of 2006 (Deborah Evans Price, December 9, 2006) and entered the Billboard charts in the top ten and has remained in the top forty for sixteen weeks. &quot;Paved the Way&quot; was recently nominated for a Grammy, Dove, &amp; Soul Train Music Award. Albertina Walker died from respiratory failure on 8 October 2010.

<doc id="1299648" wikidata="Q526884" url="?curid=1299648" title="Danse Macabre (book)">
<text>Danse Macabre is a 1981 non-fiction book by Stephen King, about horror fiction in print, TV, radio, film and comics, and the influence of contemporary societal fears and anxieties on the genre. When the book was republished King included a new Forenote dated June 1983 (however not all subsequent editions have included this forenote). And when the book was republished on February 23, 2010, it included an additional new forenote in the form of a longer essay (7,700 words) entitled &quot;What&#x27;s Scary&quot;.

&quot;Danse Macabre&quot; examines the various influences on King&#x27;s own writing, and important genre texts of the 19th and 20th centuries. &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; explores the history of the genre as far back as the Victorian era, but primarily focuses on the 1950s to the 1970s (roughly the era covering King&#x27;s own life at the time of publication). King peppers his book with informal academic insight, discussing archetypes, important authors, common narrative devices, &quot;the psychology of terror&quot;, and his key theory of &quot;Dionysian horror&quot;.

King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Stand&quot; was published in Spanish as &quot;La danza de la muerte&quot; &#x27;The Dance of Death&#x27;, which caused some confusion between the two books (A later Spanish edition of this novel was titled &quot;Apocalipsis&quot; &#x27;Apocalypse&#x27;). The same happened in Brazil and Portugal with both countries translating &quot;The Stand&quot; as &quot;A Dança da Morte&quot;, meaning also &quot;The Dance of Death&quot;. Similarly, his 1978 collection of short stories &quot;Night Shift&quot; was released in France as &quot;Danse macabre&quot; in 1980. To avoid confusion, the actual &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; essay was given the title &quot;Anatomie de l&#x27;horreur&quot; (&quot;An Anatomy of Horror&quot;) when it was released in France 14 years later, in 1995.

==Background==
In the introduction, King credits Bill Thompson, the editor of his first five published novels, and later editor at Doubleday, as being the inspiration for its creation.

Thompson ultimately convinced King that if he wrote such a genre survey, he would no longer have to answer tedious, repetitive interview questions on the topic.

==Editions==
&quot;Danse Macabre&quot; was originally published in hardcover by Everest House on April 20, 1981 (). Along with the trade hardcover, Everest House also published a limited edition of the book, signed by King, limited to 250 numbered copies and 15 lettered copies. The limited edition did not have a dust jacket, and instead was housed in a slipcase. Later, Berkley Books published a mass market paperback edition of the book on December 1, 1983 (). A new introduction was added to this edition, entitled &quot;Forenote to the Paperback Edition&quot;. Among other things, King discusses the fact that he asked Dennis Etchison &quot;to comb the errors&quot; in the original edition, and thus the 1983 paperback edition contains the corrected text of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;. In the book&#x27;s original Forenote, readers were also asked to send in any errors to be corrected, and those were incorporated as well. On February 23, 2010, Gallery Books published a new edition of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (), a trade paperback with the corrected 1983 text, including both the original and the 1983 introductions, as well as a newly written piece &quot;What&#x27;s Scary?&quot;, which serves as a forenote to this 2010 edition.

==Synopsis==
The backbone of the text is King&#x27;s teaching notes from several college courses he taught in the 1970s. However, &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; has a casual, non-linear writing style and expresses a desire to avoid &quot;academic bullshit&quot;.

In the introduction, titled &quot;October 4, 1957, and an Invitation to Dance&quot;, King begins by explaining why he wrote the book, and then describes the event itself: the launching of the Soviet satellite &quot;Sputnik&quot; which inspired profound fear in him, intended as his personal introduction to what he calls &quot;the real terror&quot;. This is followed by the chapter &quot;Tales of the Hook&quot;, specifically &quot;The Hook&quot;; an urban legend about young lovers parked in a car, who narrowly avoid an attack by an escaped prisoner with a hook for a hand. King uses this legend to illustrate his contention that horror in general &quot;offers no characterization, no theme, no particular artifice; it does not aspire to symbolic beauty&quot;.

In the following chapter, he creates a template for descriptions of his macabre subject. Entitled &quot;Tales of the Tarot&quot;, the chapter has nothing to do with the familiar tarot card deck. Rather, King borrows the term to describe his observations about major archetypal characters of the horror genre, which he posits come from two British novels and one Irish: the vampire (from &quot;Dracula&quot;), the werewolf (from &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;), and the &quot;Thing Without a Name&quot; (from &quot;Frankenstein&quot;). In light of the sexually repressed Victorian Era publication of &quot;Dracula&quot;, King sees a strong sexual undercurrent to the story. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is reviewed as &quot;a Shakespearean tragedy&quot;, and he argues that &quot;its classical unity is broken only by the author&#x27;s uncertainty as to where the fatal flaw lies—is it in Victor&#x27;s hubris (usurping a power that belongs only to God) or in his failure to take responsibility for his creation after endowing it with the life-spark?&quot; King does not mistake Mr. Hyde for a &quot;traditional&quot; werewolf, but rather sees the character as the origin of the modern archetype that was later defined by werewolves. The evil-werewolf archetype, argues King, stems from the base and violent side of humanity. These major archetypes are then reviewed in their historical context, ranging from their original appearances to their modern-day equivalents, up to and including cartoon breakfast cereal characters such as Frankenberry and Count Chocula.

The chapter &quot;An Annoying Autobiographical Pause&quot; begins with King&#x27;s explanation for why he included the section: &quot;I cannot divorce myself from a field in which I am mortally involved.&quot; He then offers a brief family history, discussing his abandonment by his father at the age of two, his childhood in rural eastern Maine, and then explains his childhood fixation with the imagery of terror and horror, making a comparison of his uncle successfully dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. While browsing through an attic with his elder brother, King uncovered a paperback version of the H.P. Lovecraft collection &quot;The Lurker in the Shadows&quot;, which had belonged to his long-since-departed father. The cover art, an illustration of a monster hiding within the recesses of a hell-like cavern beneath a tombstone, was, he writes, the moment in his life which &quot;that interior dowsing rod responded to&quot;.

King then resumes his discussion of the horror genre by making detailed commentary of horror in all forms of media, beginning with radio, then proceeding to a highly critical review of television horror, two separate chapters on horror in the motion pictures, and finally concluding with an examination of horror fiction.

His critique on the radio examines such American programs as &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;, and &quot;Boris Karloff&quot;, and praises Arch Oboler&#x27;s &quot;Lights Out&quot;. King ultimately concludes that, as a medium for horror, radio is superior to television and films, since radio&#x27;s nature requires a more active use of imagination.

King then turns to two separate chapters of horror in the motion pictures. In &quot;The Modern American Horror Movie—Text and Subtext,&quot; the &quot;subtext&quot; he refers to consists of unspoken social commentary he sees in the films. The 1951 film &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; implies commentary on the threat of communism, &quot;the quick, no-nonsense destruction of their favorite geopolitical villain, the dastardly Russians,&quot; King writes. The popular 1973 film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was aptly suited in the wake of the youth upheavals of the late 1960s and early &#x27;70s. 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, King says, &quot;has some witty things to say about Women&#x27;s Liberation ... and the American male&#x27;s response to it&quot;. In &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;, King sees &quot;economic unease&quot; and maintains that the film&#x27;s 1979 release during an extended economic slump &quot;could not have come along at a more opportune moment&quot;. He also calls &quot;The China Syndrome&quot;, released the same year and usually categorized as a disaster-suspense film, a horror movie that &quot;synthesizes technological fears ... fears of the machinery gone out of control, run wild&quot;.

In the following chapter, &quot;The Horror Movie as Junk Food&quot; King begins by making the statement: &quot;I am no apologist for bad filmmaking, but once you&#x27;ve spent twenty years or so going to horror movies, searching for diamonds in the dreck of the B-pics ... you begin to seek the patterns and appreciate them when you find them, you begin to get a taste for really shitty movies.&quot; He makes the point that his agent Kirby McCauley had selected the obscure 1977 film &quot;Rituals&quot; as his favorite, while King himself chose 1979&#x27;s &quot;Tourist Trap&quot; as one that &quot;wields an eerie spooky power. Wax figures begin to move and come to life in a ruined, out-of-the-way tourist resort.&quot; He continues with reviews of such films as &quot;Prophecy&quot; (1979), &quot;I Married a Monster from Outer Space&quot; (1958), &quot;The Horror of Party Beach&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), among others; concluding: &quot;Bad films may sometimes be amusing, sometimes even successful, but their only real usefulness is to form that basis of comparison: to define positive values in terms of their own negative charm. They show us what to look for because it is missing in themselves.&quot;

King then turns his most weighty criticism toward television, borrowing Harlan Ellison&#x27;s description of television as &quot;the glass teat&quot;, and subtitling the chapter, &quot;This Monster Is Brought to You by Gainesburgers&quot;. He reviews horror anthology programs such as &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, and &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, ultimately concluding that television is severely limited in its ability to illustrate horror because it is enslaved to the demands of network Standards and Practices censorship and the appeasement of advertising executives that provide the financial means necessary for television to continue its free access.

In the &quot;Horror Fiction&quot; chapter, King describes and reviews a number of horror novels written within a few decades of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;. He discusses Peter Straub&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Story&quot;, Anne Rivers Siddons&#x27;s &quot;The House Next Door&quot;, Richard Matheson&#x27;s &quot;The Shrinking Man&quot;, Shirley Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;, Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Strange Wine&quot;, Ira Levin&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot; by Jack Finney, Ramsey Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Doll Who Ate His Mother&quot;, and James Herbert&#x27;s &quot;The Fog&quot;. His primary context is defining what impact they have had on the horror genre, and how significantly they have contributed to the popular culture. Specifically pointing out allegories in his review, King notes:

The final chapter, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, is a brief analysis of how the medium of horror fiction in all its forms has inspired real-life acts of violence. He describes an incident in which a woman was brutally murdered by youths who confessed to imitating a scene from a TV movie, then objectively includes an example of violence perpetrated by a woman who had been reading his novel &quot;The Stand&quot; at the time she committed the crime. &quot;If it had not been shown&quot;, he writes, &quot;stupidity and lack of imagination might well have reduced them to murdering ... in some more mundane way.&quot; In an analysis of why people read and watch horror, he concludes, &quot;Perhaps we go to the forbidden door or window willingly because we understand that a time comes when we must go whether we want to or not.&quot;

=== Classification ===

Additionally, King classifies the genre into three well-defined, descending levels—terror, horror, and revulsion.

* He describes terror as &quot;the finest element&quot; of the three, and the one he strives hardest to maintain in his own writing. Citing many examples, he defines &quot;terror&quot; as the suspenseful moment in horror before the actual monster is revealed. 
* Horror, King writes, is that moment at which one sees the creature/aberration that causes the terror or suspense, a &quot;shock value&quot;. 
* King finally compares revulsion with the gag-reflex: a bottom-level, cheap gimmick which he admits he often resorts to in his own fiction if necessary, confessing:

<doc id="1299663" wikidata="Q1057396" url="?curid=1299663" title="Dorsal consonant">
<text>Dorsal consonants are consonants articulated with the back of the tongue (the dorsum). They include the palatal, velar and, in some cases, alveolo-palatal and uvular consonants. They contrast with coronal consonants, articulated with the flexible front of the tongue, and laryngeal consonants, articulated in the pharyngeal cavity.

==Function==
The dorsum of the tongue can contact a broad region of the roof of the mouth, from the hard palate (palatal consonants), the flexible velum behind that (velar consonants), to the uvula at the back of the mouth cavity (uvular consonants). These distinctions are not clear cut, and sometimes finer gradations such as &quot;pre-palatal, pre-velar,&quot; and &quot;post-velar&quot; will be noted.

Because the tip of the tongue can curl back to also contact the hard palate for retroflex consonants (&quot;subapical-palatal&quot;), consonants produced by contact between the dorsum and the palate are sometimes called &quot;dorso-palatal.&quot;

<doc id="1299675" wikidata="Q282941" url="?curid=1299675" title="Fade to Black (video game)">
<text>Fade to Black is a 1995 action-adventure game developed by Delphine Software International and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to the 1992 video game &quot;Flashback&quot;. The game was released for MS-DOS with full Gouraud-shaded 3D graphics, and PlayStation with fully textured 3D.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Fade to Black&quot; is a 3D action-adventure game with a third-person view from behind the character&#x27;s back. It features gun combat with a number of platforming sequences.

==Plot==

Intelligence agent Conrad Hart has been lying adrift in space in suspended animation for 50 years after he destroyed the home planet of a hostile alien race called Morphs. In 2190, he is found by a Morph patrol and imprisoned in the Lunar prison of New Alcatraz. There, Conrad is freed by a man named John O&#x27;Conner, who remotely guides him through the complex. Conrad escapes New Alcatraz and meets John, whereupon he learns that John is a member of Mandragore, an organized resistance movement that opposes the occupation of Earth by the surviving Morphs years before.

Conrad and John teleport to Shadow, the Mandragore homebase, moments before Morph pursuers destroy their ship. There, Conrad meets resistance leader Sarah Smith and Commander Hank. Sarah enlists Conrad&#x27;s help to rescue an eminent Earth scientist, Professor Bergstein, who is being held prisoner in Morph asteroid base D321. Conrad eventually finds Bergstein, who tells him that the base contains the Morph&#x27;s new mind-manipulating weapon. Using a computer virus handed to him by Bergstein, Conrad sabotages the computer core and escapes with Bergstein, causing the base to explode along with the asteroid itself. He is then sent to a mining facility on Mars and retrieves the coordinates to a Morph station orbiting Venus, where he rescues an incorporeal being called Ageer.

Ageer tells Conrad that he and his people, an extinct alien race from Pluto referred to as the &quot;Ancients&quot;, can lead the Mandragore to victory but, to do so, they must first find the oracle of the Ancients. They travel to Pluto and eventually find the oracle, who leads Conrad to an artifact called the Pyramid. Conrad activates the Pyramid, which relates the story of the Ancients to him. Long ago, the Ancients peacefully welcomed the Morphs, who in turn invaded Pluto and attacked their civilization, prompting the Ancients to merge their souls into the Pyramid.

A Morph mothership arrives on Pluto and steals the Pyramid. Ageer teleports Conrad aboard the mothership where the Pyramid is being held. Upon reaching the upper levels of the Mothership, he sees John before the Master Brain, an organism governing the Morphs. John reveals himself as a shapeshifting Morph creature, the Super Morph, who had disguised itself to infiltrate Shadow and plant an active detonation device. Conrad frees the Pyramid and flees back to Shadow as it is attacked by the Morphs. He fights his way through the Morphs to the command room, where Hank tells him that Sarah has the code to disable the detonation device, but she has been taken hostage by a Morph. Conrad gets to the base dormitory and saves Sarah, who gives him the code before teleporting away.

After disabling the device, Conrad joins Sarah, Hank and Ageer in planning a counterattack. With the aid of the Ancients, Mandragore have located on Earth the Master Brain that controls the Solar System. Conrad and Sarah teleport to Easter Island, where they separate. Conrad eventually finds the Master Brain and releases the Pyramid, which engages in telepathic combat with the Master Brain and defeats it. Conrad flees and finds the Super Morph attacking Sarah. He runs to a nearby spaceship, with Sarah if he has managed to rescue her. The Super Morph gives chase but is killed by the turbines of the spaceship as it escapes the exploding Easter Island to rejoin Mandragore on Shadow.

==Development==

Shortly after the release of &quot;Flashback&quot; in 1992, the development team started work on a similar sequel titled &quot;Morphs: Flashback 2&quot; for the Sega CD. Work on the game spanned 3–4 months, however, the project was put on hold while they focused on finishing &quot;Shaq Fu&quot; (1994). By the time they returned to the project, the Sega CD was no longer seen as a viable platform, so it was scrapped in favor of restarting on PC, which turned into the 3D shooter &quot;Fade to Black&quot; The idea of doing a 3D sequel to &quot;Flashback&quot; started in 1993. The game was originally announced under the title &quot;Crossfire&quot;.

Conrad&#x27;s animations were created using motion capture.

==Reception==


The PlayStation version was a best-seller in the United Kingdom, where it was among the nineteen best-selling PlayStation games of 1996 according to HMV. It sold enough copies to go Platinum.

&quot;Fade to Black&quot; received a moderately positive critical response. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the PlayStation version their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award. Reviewers generally criticized the game&#x27;s steep difficulty and blocky polygon models, but praised the background graphics and animations, and generally concluded that the game&#x27;s close blend of action and puzzling in a 3D environment was a success.

&quot;Fade to Black&quot; was named the 29th best computer game ever by &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; in 1997. The editors called it &quot;an adrenaline-pumping polygon adventure&quot; and &quot;an intriguing game&quot;. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the Playstation version 50th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

==Cancelled sequel==
&quot;Flashback Legend&quot; was an unfinished second sequel of &quot;Flashback&quot;. It was in co-development by Delphine Software International and Adeline Software International for a planned release in 2003. As opposed to &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, it was going to be a 2D side-scroller game, like &quot;Flashback&quot;, but without non-scrolling areas. It was targeted exclusively for the Game Boy Advance. The game was cancelled when Delphine went bankrupt and ceased operations in the end of 2002. However, a prototype ROM, dated 21 June 2002, was leaked and spread over the Internet at some point. It features all 16 levels with minor glitches and one music track, which is a compressed tune from &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. Despite multi-language options the beta can only be played in French with an English pause menu, but can be played in English via a fan-made patch.

<text>A garage door opener is a motorized device that opens and closes a garage door controlled by switches on the garage wall. Most also include a handheld radio remote control carried by the owner, which can be used to open and close the door from a short distance.

== The electric opener ==
The electric overhead garage door opener was invented by C.G. Johnson in 1926 in Hartford City, Indiana. Electric Garage Door openers did not become popular until Era Meter Company of Chicago offered one after World War II where the overhead garage door could be opened via a key pad located on a post at the end of the driveway or a switch inside the garage.

As in an elevator, the electric motor does not provide most of the power to move a heavy garage door. Instead, most of door&#x27;s weight is offset by the counterbalance springs attached to the door. (Even manually operated garage doors have counterbalances; otherwise, they would be too heavy for a person to open or close them.) In a typical design, torsion springs apply torque to a shaft, and that shaft applies a force to the garage door via steel counterbalance cables. The electric opener provides only a small amount of force to control how far the door opens and closes. In most cases, the garage door opener also holds the door closed in place of a lock.

The typical electric garage door opener consists of a power unit that contains the electric motor. The power unit attaches to a track. A trolley connected to an arm that attaches to the top of the garage door slides back and forth on the track, thus opening and closing the garage door. The trolley is pulled along the track by a chain, belt, or screw that turns when the motor is operated. A quick-release mechanism is attached to the trolley to allow the garage door to be disconnected from the opener for manual operation during a power failure or in case of emergency. Limit switches on the power unit control the distance the garage door opens and closes once the motor receives a signal from the remote control or wall push button to operate the door.

The entire assembly hangs above the garage door. The power unit hangs from the ceiling and is located towards the rear of the garage. The end of the track on the opposite end of the power unit attaches to a header bracket that is attached to the header wall above the garage door. The powerhead is usually supported by punched angle iron.

Recently another type of opener, known as the jackshaft opener, has become more popular. This style of opener was used frequently on commercial doors but in recent years has been adapted for residential use. This style of opener consists of a motor that attaches to the side of the torsion rod and moves the door up and down by simply spinning the rod. These openers need a few extra components to function safely for residential use. These include a cable tension monitor, to detect when a cable is broken, and a separate locking mechanism to lock the door when it is fully closed. These have the advantage that they free up ceiling space that an ordinary opener and rail would occupy. These also have the disadvantage that the door must have a torsion rod to attach the motor to.

==Types==
There are six types of garage door openers:
# Chain drive openers. These have a chain (similar to a bicycle&#x27;s) that connects the trolley to the motor.
# Belt drive openers use a rubber belt in place of a chain.
# Screw drive openers have a long screw inside the track. The trolley connects to this screw.
# Direct drive openers have the motor installed inside the trolley and use a gear wheel to guide the trolley along a fixed chain.
# Jackshaft openers mount on the wall at either end of the torsion bar.
# Roller openers automate roller doors, which roll upward and coil around a drum above the garage entrance, maximizing space. 
These openers typically feature two tines that slide into a drum wheel within the roller door mechanism, engaging to smoothly lift or lower the door.

==Remote control==
The first wireless garage door openers were invented and developed by two US inventors at the same time, one in Illinois and the other in Washington state, around 1930. They were unknown to each other.

The first garage door opener remote controls were simple and consisted of a simple transmitter (the remote) and receiver which controlled the opener mechanism. The transmitter would transmit on a designated frequency; the receiver would listen for the radio signal, then open or close the garage, depending on the door position. The basic concept of this can be traced back to World War II. This type of system was used to detonate remote bombs. While novel at the time, the technology ran its course when garage door openers became popular. While the garage door remote control transmitter is low power and has limited range, its signal can be received by other, nearby, garage door openers. When two neighbors had garage door openers, then opening one garage door might open the neighbor&#x27;s garage door as well.

The second stage of the wireless garage door opener system solved the opening-the-neighbor&#x27;s-garage-door problem. The remote controls on these systems transmitted a digital code, and the receiver in the garage responded only to that code. The codes were typically set by eight to twelve DIP switches on the receiver and transmitter, so they allowed for to different codes. As long as neighbors used different codes, they would not open each other&#x27;s garage doors. The intent of these systems was to avoid interference with nearby garage doors; the systems were not designed with security in mind. Intruders were able to defeat the security of these systems and gain entry to the garage and the house. The number of codes was small enough that even an unsophisticated intruder with a compatible remote control transmitter could just start transmitting all possible codes until he found one that opened the door. More sophisticated intruders could acquire a black box master key that automatically transmitted every possible code in a short time. An even more sophisticated method is known as a replay attack. The attacker would use a code grabber, which has a receiver that captures the remote&#x27;s digital code and can retransmit that digital code at a later time. The attacker with a code grabber would wait nearby for the homeowner to use his remote, capture the code, and then replay the code to open the door when the homeowner was gone. Multicode openers became unpopular in areas where security was important, but due to their ease of programming, such openers are often used to operate such things as the gates in gated apartment complexes.

An intermediate stage of the garage door opener market eliminated the DIP switches and used remotes preprogrammed to one out of roughly 3.5 billion unique codes. The receiver would maintain a security list of remotes to which it would respond; the user could easily add the unique remote&#x27;s code to the list by pressing a button on the garage door opener while activating the remote control. A large number of codes made the brute force try-all-possible-digital-codes attacks infeasible, but the systems were still vulnerable to code grabbers. For user convenience, these systems were also backward compatible with the older DIP switch remote codes, but adding an old technology remote to the security list made the garage door opener vulnerable to a brute force attack to find the DIP switch code. The larger code space approach was an improvement over the fixed DIP switch codes but was still vulnerable to the replay attack.

The third stage of garage door opener technology uses a frequency spectrum range between 300-400 MHz and rolling code (code hopping) technology to defeat code grabbers. In addition to transmitting a unique identifier for the remote control, a sequence number and an encrypted message are also sent. Although an intruder could still capture the code used to open a garage door, the sequence number immediately expires, so retransmitting the code later would not open the garage door. The encryption makes it extremely difficult for an intruder to forge a message with the next sequence number that would open the door. Some rolling code systems are more involved than others. Because there is a high probability that someone will push the remote&#x27;s button while not in range and thus advance the sequence number, the receiver does not insist the sequence number increase by exactly one; it will accept a sequence number that falls within a narrow window or two successive sequence numbers in a much wider window. Rolling code technology is also used on car remote controls and with some internet protocols for secure sites.

The fourth stage of garage door opener systems is similar to third stage, but it is limited to the 315 MHz frequency. The 315 MHz frequency range avoids interference from the land mobile radio system (LMRS) used by the U.S. military.

The following standards are used by units manufactured by Chamberlain (including LiftMaster and Craftsman):
 &quot;Does not apply to keyless entry keypads or universal remotes.&quot;

Recent Chamberlain garage door openers that have Security+ 2.0 features also use a special serial protocol on wired connections rather than a simple switch closure.

The following standards are used by units manufactured by Overhead Door Corporation and its subsidiary The Genie Company:

 &quot;Note: There are no standard color codes for the learn button or LED on units manufactured by Overhead Door or Genie. All accessories made for later versions of Genie Intellicode and Overhead Door CodeDodger are backward compatible with previous generations of Intellicode and CodeDodger.&quot;

== Cloning garage door opener remotes ==
Many garage door opener remote controls use fixed-code encoding which use DIP switches or soldering to do the address pins coding process, and they usually use pt2262/pt2272 or compatible ICs. For these fixed-code garage door opener remotes, one can easily clone the existing remote using a self-learning remote control duplicator (copy remote) which can make a copy of the remote using face-to-face copying.

==Additional features==
Additional features that have been added over the years have included:
* Automatic courtesy lights that turn on when the door opens (or via motion sensors) and automatically turn off after a preset delay
* A remote lockout feature, which turns off the radio receiver while one is on vacation or away for an extended time.
* The availability of accessories has increased, including such features as wireless keypads, key chain remotes, and solenoid-operated deadbolts to lock the door itself.
* Automatic door closing feature, which after a fixed time by the owner, closes the garage door to prevent theft.

More sophisticated features are also available, such as an integrated carbon monoxide sensor to open the door in case of the garage being flooded with exhaust fumes. Other systems allow door activation over the Internet to allow home owners to open their garage door from their office for deliveries.

Another recent innovation in the garage door opener is a fingerprint-based wireless keypad. This unit attaches to the outside of the garage door on the jamb and allows users to open and close their doors with the press of a finger, rather than creating a personal identification number (PIN). This is especially helpful for families with children who may forget a code and are latchkey kids.

==Safety==

The garage door is generally the largest moving object in a home. An improperly adjusted garage door opener can exert strong and deadly forces and might not reverse the garage door in an emergency. The manufacturer&#x27;s instructions provide guidance to the user on the proper adjustment and maintenance of the opener.

Garage door openers manufactured and installed in the United States since 1982 are required to provide a quick-release mechanism on the trolley that allows for the garage door to be disconnected from the garage door opener in the event of entrapment. Garage door openers manufactured since 1991 are also required to reverse the garage door if it strikes a solid object.

In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990 required that automatic residential garage door operators manufactured on or after 1 January 1991 conform to the entrapment protection requirements of the 1988 version of ANSI/UL standard 325. A requirement for redundant entrapment-prevention devices was added in 1993; such a system can use an electric eye, a door edge sensor, or any other device that provides equivalent protection by reversing the travel of the closing door if an object is detected in its path.

=== California Senate Bill No. 969 ===

In California, Senate Bill No. 969 requires that any automatic residential garage door opener that is manufactured for sale, sold, offered for sale, or installed in a residence to have a battery backup function that is designed to operate when activated because of an electrical outage. The bill went into effect on July 1, 2019. Under the bill, any automatic garage door opener that is in violation is subject to a civil penalty of $1000.

The bill was passed by Gov. Jerry Brown on Sept. 21, 2018, in response to the 2017 California Wildfires in which at least 5 individuals lost their lives because they could not open their garage door when the power went out.

The Door and Access Systems Manufacturers Association International opposed the bill arguing that garage door openers with backup batteries require regular maintenance and that the bill should be amended to make this clear. In addition, they said that &quot;garage door openers with backup batteries are not designed to serve as life safety devices, and should not be relied upon to prove a means of egress from a garage during an electrical outage.&quot;

The bill passed, despite most garage doors having a release pull cord.

<text>Paul Dryden Warfield (born November 28, 1942) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) from 1964 to 1977 for the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins, except for a year in the World Football League (WFL) with the Memphis Southmen in 1975. He was known for his speed, fluid moves, grace, and jumping ability. A consistent big-play threat throughout his career, his 20.1 average yards per reception is the highest in NFL history among players with at least 300 receptions.

As a star halfback playing college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, Warfield was twice named to the all-conference team in the Big Ten. He was selected in the first round of the 1964 NFL draft by the Browns and converted into a wide receiver. After three Pro Bowl appearances with the Browns, he was traded to the Dolphins, with whom he made another five Pro Bowl appearances. He then spent one season in the WFL with the Southmen before returning to the Browns for his final two seasons of play.

Warfield played in seven championship games in his professional career—four NFL Championship Games with the Browns and three Super Bowls with the Dolphins—and earned victories in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, Super Bowl VII, and Super Bowl VIII. After his playing career, he served as a scout and adviser for the Browns for several years. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983, and is a member of the Cleveland Browns Ring of Honor and the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll.

==Early life==
Paul Dryden Warfield was born in Warren, Ohio. His father, Dryden Warfield, was a deacon in a Baptist church. Warfield attended Warren G. Harding High School in Warren, where he was a star running back and defensive back for the Panthers. He scored 92 points as a junior in 1958, a campaign highlighted by a 6–0 victory over powerhouse Massillon Washington High School. The following season, as a senior he scored 93 points, including all three of his team&#x27;s touchdowns in the final game of the season. As a basketball player he was noted for his speed, often leading fast breaks. He also ran track and field at Warren G. Harding, and was the Ohio High School Athletic Association Class AA broad jump champion in 1958. During the 1960 season he set a Class AA state record while winning the 180-yard hurdles.

==College career==

Warfield then attended Ohio State University, where he played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team under coach Woody Hayes. As he did in high school, he continued to star as both a running back and defensive back. As the secondary ball-carrier behind fullback Bob Ferguson during Ohio State&#x27;s national championship season in 1961, Warfield carried 77 times for 420 yards and five touchdowns. He was a third-team All-Big Ten Conference selection by the conference&#x27;s coaches. In 1962 he rushed for 367 yards and two touchdowns, and his 6.4 yards-per-carry average led the Big Ten. As a senior in 1963 he rushed for 260 yards and a touchdown and caught 22 passes for 266 yards and three touchdowns. He was voted by the Big Ten&#x27;s coaches as the first-team halfback on both the 1962 and 1963 All-Big Ten teams.

A two-time letterman in track and field at Ohio State, Warfield competed as a broad jumper, hurdler, and sprinter. He excelled as a broad jumper, recording a personal best of 26 feet 2 inches, and was an Olympic prospect before he decided to play professional football.

==Professional career==

===Cleveland Browns===
The Cleveland Browns selected Warfield with the 11th pick of the 1964 NFL draft. There was some thought for Warfield to play as a defensive back. But during workouts prior to the season, his play as a wide receiver impressed head coach Blanton Collier, and he was converted to the position. In his rookie season, he caught 52 passes for 920 yards and nine touchdowns. He averaged 17.8 yards per reception, and his speed served to complement the power of star running back Jim Brown. The Browns finished the season atop the East Division with a 10–3–1 record, and defeated the Baltimore Colts 27–0 in the 1964 NFL Championship Game. Warfield was invited to his first Pro Bowl and was named a first-team All-Pro by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA).

In the 1965 Chicago College All-Star Game, which annually pitted the reigning NFL champion against star college players, Warfield shattered his collarbone and missed the majority of the 1965 season as a result. He returned for the penultimate game of the season and caught three passes for 30 yards before bruising his collarbone, causing him to miss the final game of the regular season. The Browns returned to the NFL Championship Game in 1965, in which Warfield caught two passes for 30 yards in a 23–12 loss to the Green Bay Packers.

Warfield returned to form in 1966, catching 36 passes for 741 yards and five touchdowns, and in 1967 recorded 32 receptions for 702 yards and eight touchdowns. In 1968, Warfield caught 50 passes and for the only time in his career eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards, finishing with 1,067. His career-high 12 receiving touchdowns led the league that year. The Browns again reached the NFL Championship Game, where they were shutout by the Baltimore Colts, 34–0. Warfield earned first-team All-Pro honors from the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot;, and NEA, and made another Pro Bowl appearance.

After another NFL championship game appearance for the Browns and Pro Bowl season for Warfield in 1969, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins for the third pick in the 1970 draft. The trade came as a shock to Warfield, who had established himself as one of the Browns&#x27; most popular players. &quot;I have to admit going to Miami was not a place I desired to go,&quot; said Warfield 30 years later. The Browns used the pick acquired in the trade on Purdue University quarterback Mike Phipps. The trade is considered one of the most lopsided in NFL history, as Phipps had only limited success for the Browns, while Warfield was a major factor in the Dolphins&#x27; championships in the early 1970s.

===Miami Dolphins===
In need of a deep-play receiver, Dolphins head coach Don Shula stated he &quot;jumped at the chance&quot; to acquire Warfield, saying he had always admired him and called him &quot;a real thoroughbred, equal to the best in the game.&quot; In his first season with Miami, Warfield caught only 28 passes but recorded 703 yards, an average of 25.1 yards per catch. He was invited to his first Pro Bowl with the Dolphins and was named a second-team All-Pro by the NEA. The Dolphins finished with a 10–4 record and lost to the Oakland Raiders in the divisional round of the 1970 playoffs.

In 1971, Warfield caught 43 passes for 996 yards and again led the league in receiving touchdowns, with 11. He earned first-team All-Pro honors from the AP and UPI, among other selectors, and made his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl appearance. Through the Dolphins&#x27; first two games of the 1971 playoffs, against the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Colts, Warfield caught nine passes for 265 yards and a touchdown. Shortly before Super Bowl VI between the Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys, President Richard Nixon famously telephoned Dolphins coach Don Shula to suggest that they run a particular pass play to Warfield. The play, a down-and-in pattern, was tried and resulted in an incomplete pass. Covered by star defensive back Mel Renfro, Warfield was limited to four receptions for 39 yards as the Dolphins were defeated 24–3.

Warfield missed two games in the Dolphins&#x27; undefeated 1972 season due to an injured foot but still led the team with 606 receiving yards. Through Miami&#x27;s three postseason games of 1972, Warfield caught seven passes for 149 yards and carried the ball twice for 41 yards. The Dolphins defeated the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII to earn their first Super Bowl title.

Although Warfield caught only 29 passes during the 1973 season, 11 of those receptions were touchdowns, with 4 coming in the first half of the regular season finale over the Detroit Lions. In the Dolphins&#x27; three playoff games that year, Warfield caught seven passes for 155 yards and a touchdown. The Dolphins reached the Super Bowl for the third consecutive year, and won it for the second straight time by defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII.

In 1974, Warfield caught 27 passes for 536 yards and 2 touchdowns, and was invited to the last of 2 consecutive Pro Bowls. The Dolphins again reached the playoffs, this time losing to the Raiders in the divisional round. Through 5 seasons with the Dolphins, Warfield compiled 156 receptions for 3,355 yards and 33 touchdowns. In 11 playoff games, he caught 34 passes for 717 yards and 4 touchdowns.

===Memphis Southmen===
In March 1974, he was selected by the Toronto Northmen in the second round (23rd overall) of the WFL Pro Draft. Prior to the start of the 1974 season, Warfield and teammates Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick made what were then surprising decisions. They left the Dolphins at the conclusion of the season for what appeared to be more lucrative pastures with the Northmen of World Football League (WFL). The Northmen then moved to Memphis, Tennessee, without playing a game in Toronto, and became the Memphis Southmen. Warfield played the 1975 season with the Memphis Southmen, catching 25 passes for 422 yards and three touchdowns.

===Return to Browns and retirement===
After the dissolution of the WFL following the 1975 season, Warfield told reporters he would be interested in rejoining the Browns if the Southmen were not admitted into the NFL. The Southmen were refused admittance, and Warfield was ultimately persuaded to rejoin by Browns owner Art Modell, who felt Warfield would be a valuable asset as both a receiver and in public relations. Warfield played his final two pro football seasons in Cleveland, catching 38 passes for 613 yards and six touchdowns in 1976 and 18 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns in 1977. In his eight years with the Browns, he caught 271 passes for 5,210 yards and 52 touchdowns.

In his 13 NFL seasons Warfield caught 427 passes for 8,565 yards for 20.1 yards per catch and scored 85 touchdowns. He added another 204 yards on 22 rushing attempts. In 18 playoff games, he caught 58 passes for 1,121 yards and five touchdowns. His 85 career receiving touchdowns is tied for 15th most in NFL history, and his 20.1 average yards per reception is tied for the fourth highest among players with at least 200 career receptions and the highest among players with at least 300 receptions. At the time of his retirement, his 1,121 postseason receiving yards were the second highest total in NFL history, trailing only Fred Biletnikoff by 46 yards.

== Honors and later life == 

Warfield was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983, his first year of eligibility, one of only five Dolphins to accomplish this feat (Jim Langer, Jason Taylor, Dan Marino and Don Shula). He is a member of the NFL 1970s All-Decade Team as one of the best players of the decade. In 1999, he was ranked 60th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. He is on the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll, and was an inaugural inductee into the Cleveland Browns Ring of Honor in 2010. Warfield participated in the opening coin flip for the Ohio State–Michigan game in 2006 between the No. 1-ranked Buckeyes and No. 2-ranked Wolverines. In 2013, Warren G. Harding High School erected a life-size statue of Warfield near the school&#x27;s stadium.

In 1977, Warfield earned a master&#x27;s degree in telecommunications from Kent State University. During his time as a student, Warfield was a sportscaster for the morning drive program on the university&#x27;s radio station, WKSU-FM, and presided over the station&#x27;s first pledge drive in April 1974 following its conversion to a public radio outlet. He worked for WKYC in Cleveland as a sportscaster from 1977 to 1980. He also later served as president of a management consultant firm in Moraine, Ohio. From 1981 to 1987, he worked as director of player relations for the Browns, and from 2004 to 2010 was senior adviser to the general manager for the team. Warfield is retired and resides in Rancho Mirage, California.

<text>William Karnet Willis (October 5, 1921 – November 27, 2007) was an American professional football middle guard and guard who played for eight seasons with the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and the National Football League (NFL). Known for his quickness and strength despite his small stature, Willis was one of the dominant defensive football players of the 1940s and early 1950s. He was named an All-Pro in every season of his career and reached the NFL&#x27;s Pro Bowl in three of the four seasons he played in the league. His techniques and style of play were emulated by other teams, and his versatility as a pass-rusher and coverage man influenced the development of the modern-day linebacker position. When he retired, Cleveland coach Paul Brown called him &quot;one of the outstanding linemen in the history of professional football&quot;.

Willis was one of the first two African Americans to play professional football in the modern era, signing with the Browns and playing a game in September 1946 along with Marion Motley, a contest which took place months before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Born in Columbus, Ohio, Willis attended Ohio State University, where he joined the track and football teams. He was part of a Buckeyes football team that won the school&#x27;s first national championship in 1942. After graduating in 1944, Willis heard about a new AAFC club in Cleveland led by his old Ohio State coach, Paul Brown. He got a tryout and made the team. With Willis as a defensive anchor, the Browns won all four AAFC championships between 1946 and 1949, when the league dissolved. The Browns were then absorbed by the NFL, where Willis continued to succeed. Cleveland won the NFL championship in 1950.

Willis retired in 1954 to focus on helping troubled youth, first as Cleveland&#x27;s assistant recreation commissioner and later as the chairman of the Ohio Youth Commission. He remained in that position until his death in 2007. Willis was inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame in the 1970s. He married Odessa Porter and had three sons, William Jr., Clement and Dan.

==Early life==

William Karnet Willis was born in Georgia on October 5, 1921, the son of Clement and Williana &quot;Anna&quot; Willis. The family moved to Columbus, Ohio, about 1922. His father died of pneumonia on April 10, 1923, and he was raised by his grandfather and mother amid the financial hardships of the Great Depression. He ran dashes and threw the shot put on the track team and played on the football team at Columbus East High School. He worried about being compared to his older brother Claude, who had been an All-State fullback at the same school a few years earlier, Willis eschewed the backfield to play tackle and end. He had a successful three years on the high school team, winning Honorable Mention All-State honors as a senior. After graduating from high school, Willis took a year off and worked. Willis&#x27;s high school coach wrote to Paul Brown, the Ohio State University football coach, saying the school should recruit him because he matched the type of player Brown liked: large, but more importantly, quick. He enrolled at Ohio State in 1941.

==College career==
Willis was small for a lineman at 202 pounds, and despite signing up to play for Brown he was initially expected to focus on track and the 60-yard and 100-yard dashes. Brown, however, brought him onto the football team as a sophomore in 1942. Willis played middle guard, a defensive position opposite the center. That year, the Buckeyes posted a 9–1 record and won the Big Ten Conference. The team was voted national champion by the Associated Press, a first for the school.
Before the following season, scores of Ohio State players left the school to join the military as American involvement in World War II intensified. Willis volunteered for the U.S. Army, but was classified as 4-F, or only available for service in case of a national emergency, due to varicose veins. With many stars gone, however, Brown fielded a team composed mostly of 17-year-olds who were not yet eligible for military service. The &quot;Baby Bucks&quot;, as they were called, fell to 3–6, although Willis was named a first-team All Conference selection in the Big Ten.

By the 1944 season, Brown had joined the military and was coaching a team at Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside Chicago. Under his substitute, coach Carroll Widdoes, the Buckeyes completed an undefeated season. Willis was named to the United Press International and &quot;Look&quot; magazine All-America teams. He played in the 1944 College All-Star Game at Chicago, and was named the game&#x27;s outstanding player.

==Professional career==

A professional football career was unlikely for Willis when he graduated from Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen&#x27;s agreement had been in effect ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but with no real prospect of playing professionally, Willis took a job as the head football coach at Kentucky State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort.

Willis, however, still wanted to play football. &quot;My heart was not really in coaching&quot;, he later said. He read that Paul Brown was coaching a team in the newly formed All-America Football Conference (AAFC), and he gave Brown a call. Brown said he would get back to Willis on a possible tryout. In the meantime, Willis was recruited by the Montreal Alouettes, a team in the Canadian Football League. Not hearing back from Brown, he planned to go play in Canada. Willis was about to leave for Montreal when Paul Hornung, a sportswriter for the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;, called with a message from Brown. Hornung told Willis to go for a tryout in Bowling Green, Ohio, where the new team, the Cleveland Browns, was holding its training camp.

Willis went to the camp and impressed Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham&#x27;s foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center&#x27;s fingers to tighten on the ball. &quot;He was quick&quot;, said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. &quot;I don&#x27;t think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball &quot;with&quot; that ball as quick as anything you would want to see.&quot;

Willis made the team, and 10 days later the Browns signed a second African-American player, fullback Marion Motley. Willis played middle guard for the Browns, lining up opposite the center but often dropping back into coverage to defend the pass. He had a playing style and physique similar to that of the modern-day linebacker. For Brown, signing Willis and Motley was nothing unusual. Brown had black players on his teams from the time he coached at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio. The coach did not care about race one way or the other; he wanted to field the best team he could. &quot;I never considered football players black or white, nor did I keep or cut a player just because of his color&quot;, Brown wrote in his autobiography. In joining the Browns in 1946, Willis and Motley were two of four professional football players who broke the color barrier in 1946, a year before Jackie Robinson became Major League Baseball&#x27;s first black player in the modern era. Brown later added other black players to the team, including Horace Gillom and Len Ford.

With the Browns, Willis became an anchor on defense as the team dominated the AAFC. The team won each of the league&#x27;s four championship games before the AAFC folded and the Browns, along with two other teams, were absorbed by the National Football League (NFL) following the 1949 season. Willis was named to all-AAFC teams in every year of its existence.

While the team was a success, Willis and Motley contended with their share of racism. They were taunted, stepped on and insulted on the field. Off-the-field incidents also occurred. In their first season in 1946, Willis and Motley did not travel to a game against the Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade black players from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where the team was staying asked Willis and Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move the entire team, and the hotel&#x27;s management backed down. Willis and Motley were forced to stay in a separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all-star game in Houston, Texas.

The Browns&#x27; success continued when the team entered the NFL in 1950. In a playoff game that year against the New York Giants, Willis caught up with running back Gene &quot;Choo-Choo&quot; Roberts on a breakaway reception in the fourth quarter to prevent the touchdown and ensure a Browns victory. &quot;I knew it meant the ball game&quot;, he said. &quot;I just had to catch him.&quot; The Browns beat the Giants 8–3 and went on to win the NFL championship in 1950. Willis was one of seven Browns players chosen for the first-ever Pro Bowl that year.

The 1951 and 1952 seasons were equally successful for Willis, although the Browns lost in the NFL championship to the Los Angeles Rams and Detroit Lions. He was an all-pro selection and was named to the Pro Bowl in both years. In 1953, when the Browns lost a third championship game in a row, Willis was named an all-pro but did not make the Pro Bowl.

Both Willis and Motley retired after the 1953 season. Willis was 32 years old and had played eight seasons for the Browns, earning all-pro honors every year he played. He was the best player on a strong defense that was crucial to Cleveland&#x27;s success in the AAFC and NFL. He was also the embodiment of what Brown looked for in his players: speed and intelligence instead of size. At around 210 pounds, he was small for a lineman, even in his era. Willis&#x27;s play as a powerful but quick middle guard influenced the development of the modern linebacker position. &quot;In my opinion Bill ranks as one of the outstanding linemen in the history of professional football&quot;, Brown said when he retired. &quot;He certainly was the fastest and many coaches use his technique as a model in teaching line play.&quot;

==Later career and death==

Willis retired because he wanted to concentrate on other activities; he had become a popular figure in Ohio and worked with youth in Cleveland and Columbus. He accepted a $6,570-a-year job as Cleveland&#x27;s assistant recreation commissioner. &quot;This is the type of work I want to do, working with kids&quot;, he said. By the late 1970s, he was the chairman of the Ohio Youth Commission, a state agency created to combat criminality among young people. He died in 2007. He was married to Odessa Porter until her death in 2002. The couple had three sons, William Jr., Clement and Dan.

==Honors and legacy==

Willis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971. In 1977, he was inducted as a charter member of the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame. He was elected the same year to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Ohio State University honored Willis on November 3, 2007, by retiring his #99 jersey. Willis was named as a finalist for the NFL 100 All-Time Team at the defensive lineman position.

In 2020, Ohio State designated the #0 jersey (the Block O jersey) to be worn in recognition of Willis. A new OSU player will wear the number each season.

<doc id="1299714" wikidata="Q1052862" url="?curid=1299714" title="Macintosh IIvx">
<text>The Macintosh IIvx is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from October 1992 to October 1993. It is the last of the Macintosh II family of Macintosh computers. The IIvx was introduced at the same time as the slower Macintosh IIvi, with both models using the same metal case design as the earlier Performa 600 and Performa 600CD. Like the Performa 600CD, the IIvx could be equipped with an internal double-speed CD-ROM drive.

==Hardware==
The Mac IIvx began its life in development as a proof-of-concept to see how an internal CD-ROM drive could be added to a Mac. But after Apple CEO John Sculley gave a speech at MacWorld Tokyo promising a Mac with a CD-ROM drive, the IIvx was rushed into production. Several shortcuts were taken in its design; most notably, its 32 MHz Motorola 68030 processor was crippled by a 16 MHz bus, making it slightly slower than the popular but aging Macintosh IIci. Its serial port was limited to 57.6 kbit/s, which could cause problems with serial connections and MIDI hardware. The Macintosh IIvi (a slower version of the IIvx with a 16 MHz processor) was introduced at the same time in some markets (though not the United States) but discontinued four months later. Representing the high end of the original Performa lineup, the Performa 600 was also based on the same architecture. The IIvx was one of the only Macintosh II models with a 32K L2 cache, following the IIfx&#x27;s onboard 32K cache and the IIci&#x27;s optional 32K cache card; neither the IIvi nor the Performa 600 supported an L2 cache, despite their similarities to the IIvx.

The IIvx was sold with hard drives ranging in capacity from 40 to , three NuBus slots, and a Processor Direct Slot.

The case for the Macintosh IIvx and Macintosh IIvi (Performa 600) would later be used for the, Centris 650, Quadra 650 (the speed-bumped refresh of the Centris 650), and Power Macintosh 7100. The IIvx can be upgraded to Centris/Quadra 650 by swapping the logic board.

==Reception and replacement==
Upon release the IIvx was described in a &quot;MacWorld&quot; magazine review as having &quot;the best price-to-performance ratio of any computer Apple has ever built.&quot; The list price for a machine with an hard drive, main memory, and of video memory was US$2,949. Adding the CD-ROM and upgrading to of main memory and video memory increased the price to US$3,219, which &quot;Macworld&quot; deemed to be &quot;the best CD-ROM drive bargain ever offered&quot;.

While the IIvx was released as part of the Macintosh II family, Apple originally intended the IIvx to be the first computer in the Macintosh Centris line. According to Apple, their lawyers were unable to complete the trademark check on the &quot;Centris&quot; name in time for the release of this computer so it ended up being sold as the IIvx. Machines bearing the Centris name were introduced a few months later, ending up all Centris models were powered by the 68040 or 68LC040 so the IIvx with its 68030 was never rebranded as a Centris. Notably, the Macintosh Centris 650 was released in February 1993 with an entry-level configuration that was $250 less than the IIvx&#x27;s starting price in October 1992, so then Apple then slashed the IIvx&#x27;s base price by more than a third to prevent obsolescence. Because of increasing competition from Dell and other IBM PC compatible manufacturers who were offering the Intel i486DX (the equivalent to the 68040), prices of the IIvx continued to fall quickly; by the end of June 1993, the price of the 5/80 + CD-ROM configuration had dropped to $1,799, about half its original price. For a while afterwards, people who bought an expensive Mac that quickly became outdated were said to have been &quot;IIvx-ed&quot;. 

The IIvx was discontinued in October 1993, alongside the rebranding of Centris models to Quadra, and the release of the Quadra 605 (also sold as the LC 475 and Performa 475). The Quadra 605 was Apple&#x27;s most affordable model to have the 68LC040 (upgradable to the 68040 which includes FPU), but was not a direct replacement in form nor price to the IIvx.

<text>Dragan Mladenović (Serbian Cyrillic: Драган Младеновић; born 16 February 1976) is a retired Serbian professional footballer.

==Career==
Mladenović joined Rangers from Serbian champions Red Star Belgrade for £1.1m in August 2004. He made his Rangers debut against Hibernian on 21 August 2004. However, he failed to settle at Ibrox and was subsequently loaned out to Real Sociedad in January 2005. He was released by Rangers on August 30, despite having three years left on his contract, and re-joined Red Star Belgrade on a free transfer. This time he wasn&#x27;t so successful. In 2006, Mladenović joined South Korean side Incheon United, where he continued playing until the 2009/10 season, after which he retired from professional football. Today he lives in Belgrade, Serbia, and currently is director of Red Star Belgrade youth academy.

<text>Anthony Antony] Holborne Holburne] (c. 1545 – 29 November 1602) was a composer of music for lute, cittern, and instrumental consort during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.

==Life==
An &quot;Anthony Holburne&quot; entered Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1562, and it is possible that this person is the same as the composer. A Londoner of the same name was admitted to the Inner Temple Court in 1565, and again this may have been the same person. It is certain, however, that the composer was the brother of William Holborne and that he married Elisabeth Marten on 14 June 1584. On the title page of both his books, he claims to be in the service of Queen Elizabeth. He died of a &quot;cold&quot; in November 1602.

He was held in the highest regard as a composer by his contemporaries. John Dowland dedicated the first song &quot;I saw my lady weepe&quot; in his &quot;Second Booke&quot; to Holborne. His patron was the Countess of Pembroke, Mary Sidney. In the 1590s, he entered the service of Sir Robert Cecil, the 1st Earl of Salisbury.

His brother was William Holborne. Six of William&#x27;s madrigals were included in the &quot;Cittarn Schoole&quot;.

==Music==
His first known book was the &quot;Cittarn Schoole&quot; of 1597, consisting of compositions for the cittern. The preface indicates the pieces were composed over a number of years. He writes that the musical compositions are &quot;untimely fruits of my youth, begotten in the cradle and infancy of my slender skill.&quot;

The &quot;Pavans, Galliards, Almains and other short Aeirs, both grave and light, in five parts, for Viols, Violins, or other Musicall Winde Instruments&quot; was published in 1599 and consisted of 65 of his own compositions. It is the largest surviving collection of its kind. Most are of the pavan-galliard combination. Other pieces are of the allemande style. The rest are unclassified.

The Early Music Consort of London&#x27;s 1976 recording of &quot;The Fairie Round&quot; from this collection was included on the Voyager Golden Record, copies of which were sent into space aboard the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes in 1977, as a representation of human culture and achievement to any who might find it.

<doc id="1299729" wikidata="Q229592" url="?curid=1299729" title="Matilda I, Countess of Boulogne">
<text>Matilda ( – 3 May 1152) was &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Boulogne from 1125 and Queen of England from the accession of her husband, Stephen, in 1135 until her death in 1152. She supported Stephen in his struggle for the English throne against their mutual cousin Empress Matilda. She played an unusually active role for a woman of the period when her husband was captured, and proved herself an effective general who managed to force the Empress to release Stephen. Under the agreement that settled the civil war, the Queen&#x27;s children did not inherit the English throne but her three surviving children ruled Boulogne in turn as Eustace IV, William I, and Marie I.

==Background==
Matilda was born in Boulogne, France. Her father was Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Her mother, Mary, was the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Through her maternal grandmother, Matilda was descended from the Anglo-Saxon kings of England.

==Countess of Boulogne==
In 1125, Matilda married Stephen of Blois, Count of Mortain, who possessed a large honour in England. When Matilda&#x27;s father abdicated and retired to a monastery the same year, this was joined with Boulogne and the similarly large English honour Matilda inherited.

On Eustace III&#x27;s death, Matilda and her husband became joint rulers of Boulogne. Two children, a son and a daughter, were born to the countess and count of Boulogne during the reign of King Henry I of England, who had granted them a residence in London. The son was named Baldwin, after Matilda&#x27;s uncle King Baldwin I of Jerusalem. The daughter was named Matilda. Baldwin died in early childhood and the young Matilda is thought to have died during childhood too, although she lived long enough to be espoused to Waleran de Meulan, Earl of Worcester.

== Queenship ==

On the death of Henry I of England in 1135, Stephen rushed to England, taking advantage of Boulogne&#x27;s control of the closest seaports, and was crowned king, beating his rival, the Empress Matilda. Matilda of Boulogne was heavily pregnant at that time and crossed the Channel after giving birth to a son, William, who would one day succeed as count of Boulogne. Matilda was crowned queen at Easter, on 22 March 1136.

Matilda was a supporter of the Knights Templar. She founded Cressing Temple in Essex in 1137 and Temple Cowley in Oxford in 1139. Like her predecessor, Matilda of Scotland, she had a close relationship with the Holy Trinity Priory at Aldgate. She took the prior as her confessor and two of her children were buried there.

In the civil war that followed, known as the Anarchy, Matilda proved to be her husband&#x27;s strongest supporter. When England was invaded in 1138, she called troops from Boulogne and its ally Flanders, and besieged Dover Castle with success and then went north to Durham, where she made a treaty with David I of Scotland in 1139.

After Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, she rallied the king&#x27;s partisans, and raised an army with the help of William of Ypres. While the Empress Matilda waited in London to prepare her coronation, Matilda and Stephen&#x27;s brother Henry of Blois had her chased out of the city. The Empress Matilda went on to besiege Henry of Blois at Winchester. Matilda of Boulogne then commanded her army to attack the besiegers. There was a rout in which the Empress&#x27;s half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, was captured. The two Matildas then agreed to exchange prisoners and Stephen ruled as king again.

In 1147 she founded the Royal Foundation of St Katharine, which still exists today.

Matilda died of a fever in May 1152 at Hedingham Castle, Essex, England, and is buried at Faversham Abbey, which she and her husband founded.

==Issue==
Stephen and Matilda had three sons:
*Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne, married Constance of France, no issue
*Baldwin of Boulogne (d. before 1135)
*William of Blois, Count of Mortain and Boulogne and Earl of Surrey, married Isabel de Warenne, no issue

They also had two daughters:

*Matilda of Boulogne, married Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester, no issue
*Marie I, Countess of Boulogne, married Matthew of Alsace, had issue

<doc id="1299747" wikidata="Q4763420" url="?curid=1299747" title="Anglian stage">
<text>The Anglian Stage is the name used in the British Isles for a middle Pleistocene glaciation. It precedes the Hoxnian Stage and follows the Cromerian Stage in the British Isles. It correlates to Marine Isotope Stage 12 (MIS 12), which started about 478,000 years ago and ended about 424,000 years ago.

==Description==
The Anglian stage has often been correlated to the Elsterian Stage of northern Continental Europe and the Mindel Stage in the Alps.

The Anglian was the most extreme glaciation during the last two million years. In Britain the ice sheet reached the Isles of Scilly and the Western Approaches, the furthest south the ice reached in any Pleistocene ice age. In the south-east of England it diverted the River Thames from its old course through the Vale of St Albans south to its present position.

This stage had been equated to the Kansan Stage in North America. The stage names &quot;Kansan&quot;, &quot;Yarmouth&quot;, &quot;Nebraskan&quot; and &quot;Aftonian&quot; were later abandoned by North American Quaternary geologists and merged into the Pre-Illinoian stage. The Anglian Stage is now correlated with the period of time which includes the Pre-Illinoian B glaciation of North America.

<doc id="1299749" wikidata="Q1688146" url="?curid=1299749" title="Jesse Chisholm">
<text>Jesse Chisholm (&quot;circa &quot;1805 - March 4, 1868) was a Scotch-Cherokee fur trader and merchant in the American West. Chisholm is known for having scouted and developed what became known as the Chisholm Trail, later used to drive cattle from Texas to railheads in Kansas in the post-Civil War period.

Chisholm used this trail to supply his trading posts among the Native American tribes in Indian Territory, what is now western Oklahoma. Chisholm worked with Black Beaver, a Lenape guide, to develop the trail. Chisholm died before the peak period of the cattle drives from Texas to Kansas, but he was essential to numerous events in Texas and Oklahoma&#x27;s history. Chisholm served as an interpreter for the Republic of Texas and the United States government in treaty-making with Native American tribes.

==Early life and education==
Chisholm&#x27;s father, Ignatius, was of Scottish descent and probably also a trader, and his mother Martha (née Rogers) was a Cherokee from the region of Great Hiwassee. As the Cherokee had matrilineal kinship, Jesse was considered to belong to his mother&#x27;s people. Chisholm moved with his mother to Indian Territory during the early period when some Cherokee migrated there voluntarily from the Southeast and grew up in Cherokee culture.

==Career==
In 1826, Chisholm became involved in working for a gold-seeking party, who blazed a trail and explored the region to present-day Wichita, Kansas. In 1830, Chisholm helped blaze a trail from Fort Gibson to Fort Towson. In 1834, Chisholm was a member of the Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition, who first contacted the southern Plains Indians on behalf of the United States federal government.

In 1836, Chisholm married Eliza Edwards. They resided in the area of her father&#x27;s trading post on the Little River near its confluence with the Canadian River in Indian Territory. Chisholm worked as a trader.

Fluent in thirteen Native American languages and Spanish, Chisholm served as an interpreter and general aid in several treaties between the Republic of Texas and local Indian tribes and between the United States federal government and various tribes after Texas joined the United States. This diplomatic work spanned 20 years between 1838 and 1858. During this period, Chisholm also continued in the Indian trade, trading manufactured goods for peltry and cattle.

He mostly remained neutral during the American Civil War. Many residents of Indian Territory feared they might be massacred, either intentionally or as an accident of war if either side attempted to contend for control of the territory. Chisholm led a band of refugees to the western part of the territory. For some time, they suffered privation, as the trade had also dried up during the war.

At the war&#x27;s end, Chisholm settled permanently near present-day Kingfisher, Oklahoma, and again began to trade into Indian Territory. Chisholm built up what had been a military and Indian trail into a road capable of carrying heavy wagons for his goods. This road later became known as Chisholm&#x27;s Trail. When the Texas-to-Kansas cattle drives started, the users of the trail renamed it the Chisholm Trail.

==Death and legacy==
Chisholm died on March 4, 1868, at his last camp near Left Hand Spring (now Oklahoma), due to food poisoning. Chisholm was buried there.

In 1974, Chisholm was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners. His grave site in Blaine County is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="1299760" wikidata="Q1140849" url="?curid=1299760" title="Cromerian Stage">
<text>The Cromerian Stage or Cromerian Complex, also called the Cromerian (), is a stage in the Pleistocene glacial history of north-western Europe, mostly occurring more than half a million years ago. It is named after the East Anglian town of Cromer in Great Britain where interglacial deposits that accumulated during part of this stage were first discovered. The stratotype for this interglacial is the Cromer Forest Bed situated at the bottom of the coastal cliff near West Runton. The Cromerian stage preceded the Anglian and Elsterian glacials and show an absence of glacial deposits in western Europe, which led to the historical terms Cromerian interglacial and the Cromerian warm period (). It is now known that the Cromerian consisted of multiple glacial and interglacial periods.

== Chronology ==
The core of the Cromerian is the first half of the Middle Pleistocene stage (Ionian) approximately 800-500 ka ago, just before the Anglian glaciation. In terms of Marine isotope stages (MIS) this corresponds to MIS 19 to MIS 13. Some authors instead put the start at MIS 22, corresponding to a start 900 ka ago, which includes the last 100 ka of the Calabrian stage, after the Beestonian Stage. Some sources today correlate the Elster glaciation to MIS 10 instead of MIS 12, while keeping the Cromerian running up to the start of the Elsterian. The result is an end to the Cromerian stage in continental Europe at the end of MIS 11 (400 ka ago), and that the continental Cromerian continues beyond its end in Britain and Ireland and runs in parallel to the Anglian and Hoxnian Stages (MIS 12-11).

In the Alpine region the corresponding stage is called Günz.

The Cromerian had been equated to the Aftonian in North America. However, the Aftonian, along with the Yarmouthian (Yarmouth), Kansan, and Nebraskan, have been abandoned by North American Quaternary geologists and merged into the Pre-Illinoian. At this time, the Cromerian is correlated with the period of time, which includes the Pre-Illinoian C, Pre-Illinoian D, and Pre-Illinoian E glaciations of North America.

Proposals for structuring the Cromerian complex have become quite confusing. Great potential for a full breakdown has been provided by the extensive, continental series at Gorleben.

== Glacial cycles ==
Based on a lack of glacial evidence in Western Europe for the Middle Pleistocene (Ionian) before the Anglian glaciation, the Cromerian was originally thought to be a period without major glaciations. However, there is evidence for ice-rafting of material across the North Sea from this period. Investigations in the 1950s of oxygene isotopes in deep sea core samples revealed five glacial cycles during MIS 22 - MIS 13. The Mid-Pleistocene Transition to the 100,000 year glacial cycle became established during the Cromerian. Four of the glaciations (MIS 22, MIS 20, MIS 18, MIS 14) were moderate, probably involving low-land glaciation in Scandinavia, but not spreading to England and northern Germany. One of the glaciations, Marine Isotope Stage 16 (MIS 16), is globally as strong as the most recent glaciations, MIS 6 (main Saale) and MIS 2 (Weichsel/Devensian). There is plenty of evidence in Russia for a major glaciation during this stage, which is called the Don Glaciation and believed to correspond to MIS 16. It is not clear why western Europe seems so unaffected by this major glacial.

== Fossils ==
In 1990 the West Runton Mammoth skeleton was found, the best example of the species Mammuthus trogontherii to be unearthed so far.

A significant fossil site, with animal remains dating about 600,000 years ago, is the Mosbach Sands in Germany, named after an abandoned village near Wiesbaden, Germany.

<text>The Macintosh IIvi (also sold as the Macintosh Performa 600) is a personal computer designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from September 1992 to February 1993. The IIvi was introduced alongside the Macintosh IIvx, using a slower Motorola 68030 processor (16 MHz vs. 32 MHz) and no floating point unit or RAM cache. The Performa 600 models, meanwhile, are the IIvi with the IIvx&#x27;s 32 MHz CPU. The IIvi was, on some benchmarks, faster than the IIvx. It is the only model in the Macintosh II family to be branded as a Performa.

This model was discontinued four months after its introduction, when the Centris 650 was introduced at a similar price point.

== Models ==
All models include three NuBus slots and a Processor Direct Slot (PDS). 

The Performa 600 models were formally introduced on September 14; shipments were delayed until October to coincide with the introduction of the IIvi and IIvx.

Introduced September 14, 1992:
* Macintosh Performa 600: 32 MHz 68030, 4 or 5 MB RAM, 512 KB VRAM, 160 MB HDD. Shipped with the Apple Extended Keyboard II and a microphone.

<text>A &quot;failure to appear&quot; (FTA), also known as &quot;bail jumping&quot;, occurs when a defendant or respondent does not come before a tribunal as directed in a summons. In the United States, FTAs are punishable by fines, incarceration, or both when committed by a criminal defendant. The severity of the punishment depends on the seriousness of the criminal charges that were the subject of the missed proceeding. An FTA may trigger a bench warrant for the defendant&#x27;s arrest and impair their eligibility for bail and pretrial release in subsequent proceedings. 

==In the United States==

=== Historically ===
Punishments for FTAs originated out of courts&#x27; contempt powers. The Judiciary Act of 1789, the first federal framework governing pretrial detention, did not single out FTAs for punishment but decreed that there should be sanctions for &quot;all contempts of authority&quot;. Specific penalties for FTAs emerged on the heels of the federal government&#x27;s campaign to prosecute Communist leaders under the Smith Act of 1940, which made it a crime to &quot;knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States&quot;. After the Supreme Court affirmed the convictions of eleven Communist leaders under the Smith Act in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, four of the defendants fled in July 1951. All four leaders either turned themselves in or were later apprehended, but their flight would inspire Congress to enact punishments for FTAs three years later:The Federal bail jumping statute was first enacted in 1954 to fill the void in the criminal law highlighted by the conduct of fleeing fugitives who were leaders of the Communist Party. The only available penalties, at that time, were forfeiture of money and contempt proceedings. In the absence of an indictable offense of bail jumping, defendants were able to buy their freedom by forfeiting their bonds and taking the risk that they could go unapprehended. Even if apprehended, many defendants could hide for periods long enough for the government&#x27;s case, especially for major offenses, to grow weaker because of the unavailability of witnesses, memory lapses, and the like, and thereby defeat the government&#x27;s prosecutive efforts. They would then be subject only to the criminal contempt charge, the sentence for which was usually of considerably less gravity than for the original offense. These were the reasons that led to the original Federal bail jumping statute of 1954.As of 1954, few FTA statutes existed at the state level. New York and Minnesota were among the earliest adopters of statutes penalizing FTAs, but these laws were rarely used in practice. By 1966, only seven states had separate sanctions for FTAs. Over thirty states implemented FTA-specific penalties over the next two decades. These laws coincided with a growing national concern about dangerous defendants and the perceived need for greater deterrence in the pretrial system.

The Bail Reform Act of 1966, one of the first significant pieces of the federal bail legislation, made &quot;willfully fail[ing] to appear before any court or judicial officer as required&quot; punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. In 1984, Congress increased the sanctions for FTAs in federal court. In early versions of the bill, lawmakers expressed their resolve to &quot;deter those who would obstruct law enforcement by failing to appear for trial or other judicial appearances and to punish those who indeed fail to appear&quot;. Lawmakers saw heightening the penalties for FTAs &quot;as a means of enhancing the effectiveness of the bail jumping offense as a deterrent to flight.&quot;

=== Modern federal law ===
Today, a defendant who &quot;fails to appear before a [federal] court as required by the conditions of release&quot; or &quot;fails to surrender for service of sentence pursuant to a court order&quot; remains subject to criminal sanctions. A court will use the following scheme to determine a defendant&#x27;s punishment:

A defendant can present an affirmative defense that &quot;uncontrollable circumstances prevented&quot; their appearance. To make this claim successfully, the defendant must not have contributed to the uncontrollable circumstances and must have &quot;appeared or surrendered as soon as such circumstances ceased to exist&quot;.

An &quot;uncontrollable circumstance&quot; can either be physical or mental, the latter of which courts refer to as &quot;duress&quot;. Not all mental pressures satisfy the uncontrollable circumstance requirement; courts have held that only something as serious as threats of significant bodily harm or death can excuse an FTA. The prospect of prosecutorial reprisal, fear of harassment, and loss of faith in the criminal justice system generally do not amount to uncontrollable duress. Courts have dismissed claims based on fears of deportation and a defendant&#x27;s desire &quot;to make a political statement or engage in protest activity&quot;. The legislative history for the federal statute indicates that the affirmative defense should only apply in extreme circumstances: &quot;for example, a person is recuperating from a heart attack and to leave his bed would imperil his life, or, after he had made careful plans for transportation to the court house, his vehicle breaks down or unexpected weather conditions bring traffic to a halt.&quot;

=== State laws ===
All fifty states have implemented statutes penalizing FTAs, which several state statutes call &quot;bail jumping&quot; in their official codes. The District of Columbia and all states besides Mississippi make FTAs the basis of additional criminal charges. For example, an FTA can qualify as a misdemeanor or felony in Idaho depending on the underlying offense:A person set at liberty by court order, with or without bail, upon condition that he will subsequently appear at a specified time and place, commits a misdemeanor if, without lawful excuse, he fails to appear at that time and place. The offense constitutes a felony where the required appearance was to answer to a charge of felony, or for disposition of any such charge, and the actor took flight or went into hiding to avoid apprehension, trial or punishment. This section does not apply to obligations to appear incident to release under suspended sentence or on probation or parole.At least thirty states and the District of Columbia authorize courts to issue bench warrants for a defendant&#x27;s arrest or orders for a defendant to appear after an FTA. Many jurisdictions leave the decision to issue a bench warrant within the judge&#x27;s discretion—at least under some circumstances. For example, in Maryland, a defendant who &quot;forfeits [...] bail or recognizance and willfully fails to surrender&quot; will have a bench warrant automatically issued for their arrest, whereas a judge retains discretion over whether to use a bench warrant when a defendant fails to appear in response to a citation.

At least forty states impose a driver&#x27;s license penalty for FTAs, often suspending an individual&#x27;s license until the person appears in court. These laws generally apply when the FTA occurs in traffic court. In Missouri, a &quot;resident charged with a moving traffic violation&quot; will have their license automatically suspended for failing to appear in court when required. At least seven states authorize driver&#x27;s license suspensions for reasons unrelated to traffic court. Other license-related punishments include &quot;authorized vehicle immobilization, liens and mandatory delinquency [and] reinstatement fees&quot;.

=== Consequences for future proceedings ===
An FTA will often follow a defendant in future proceedings. When deciding whether to release someone pretrial, a judge must usually ask whether a defendant is likely to appear for trial if released and whether the defendant would pose a danger to the community. A defendant&#x27;s record of prior court attendance is one of the primary factors that a judge looks to when determining whether to grant pretrial release. Having a single FTA can lead courts to refuse to release defendants on their own recognizance or let them post bail. Some courts rely on risk-assessment tools, which use algorithms to predict the likelihood that a defendant will not appear; a prior FTA, especially a recent one, significantly slants the algorithm toward deeming the defendant high-risk.

==Criticism==

=== Definitional problems ===
Critics argue that policymakers define &quot;failure to appear&quot; too broadly, conflating people who intentionally flee the jurisdiction with those who miss their court dates due to forgetfulness or logistical difficulties. Risk-assessment tools tend to treat all FTAs the same when calculating a defendant&#x27;s risk score. One scholar has proposed breaking FTAs into three categories: &quot;true flight&quot; (intentionally fleeing the area); local absconding (remaining in the jurisdiction but refusing to come to court even if reminded); and low-cost non-appearance (failing to appear for reasons besides avoiding justice). Critics say these types of FTAs may warrant different interventions.

=== Causes of non-appearance ===
Scholars, activists, and practitioners have criticized federal and state laws for operating on the mistaken assumption that most FTAs reflect a conscious decision to abscond. Critics believe most FTAs are the product of forgetfulness or logistical difficulties—and that, if given another opportunity, a defendant will appear when requested. They note that a single legal proceeding can span several years and consist of multiple court dates; due to backlogs in some courts, defendants may wait all day for their hearings only for a judge to impose a delay. Defendants who must go before a judge regularly can confuse or forget their court dates. Jurisdictions nationwide have reduced FTA rates by reminding people of upcoming court hearings. In New York, an effort to redesign court summons forms and notify people of their court dates using text messages reduced FTAs by 13% and 21%, respectively. These interventions resulted in an estimated 30,000 fewer warrants issued over three years.

Critics note that attending court can be particularly onerous for low-income individuals. Studies have documented a lack of access to transportation and childcare as two factors driving FTAs. Defendants may struggle to make their court dates due to conflicts with their work, as many courts are only open during business hours. Researchers have confirmed a positive correlation between indigence and FTAs across racial and gender demographics. They speculate that the logistical challenges and financial burdens associated with court attendance drove the disparities observed in their results. Advocates have called for transportation assistance and childcare support instead of criminal sanctions to address FTAs. Advocates note that some people, including houseless individuals and people dealing with substance abuse, require additional support and that the threat of criminal sanctions is ineffective.  

=== Warrant backlogs ===
Some scholars contend that FTAs have led to warrant backlogs nationwide. In 2019, around one in seven adults had warrants out for their arrest in New Orleans, Louisiana; FTAs were responsible for over half of warrants issued in New Orleans in 2017. A Department of Justice investigation of the police department in Ferguson, Missouri, found that a municipal court had generated thousands of FTA warrants and used them to impose fines and fees on residents. Individuals with warrants out of their arrest may be less likely to seek educational and employment opportunities for fear of getting apprehended. They may have their driver&#x27;s license revoked and cannot access public benefits. Several jurisdictions have taken steps to clear FTA warrants to reduce these backlogs.

=== Questions about FTA prevalence ===
Whether FTA rates are prevalent enough to warrant criminal sanctions has become a point of contention. FTAs are most common for lower-level, non-violent crimes: primarily in traffic court. Not all individuals who receive a traffic ticket or summons for a minor infraction realize that not attending court can lead to a warrant for their arrest. For serious felonies, FTAs are relatively rare. The most recent data available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics demonstrate that 83% of felony defendants will never miss a court date. The majority of those who miss an appearance will return to court within one year. FTA rates are also challenging to measure and compare. Some jurisdictions treat a single-missed court appearance as an FTA, such that a new FTA arises whenever an individual misses a court date in a single legal proceeding. Other jurisdictions treat all missed court appearances within one legal proceeding as a single FTA.

<text>Butterfly Giselle Grace Boucher (born 2 June 1979) is an Australian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer born in Adelaide. From the age of 15 years she played bass guitar in her older sister Rebecca Boucher Burns (Becca)&#x27;s band Eat the Menu (later named The Mercy Bell), which issued a debut album, &quot;Whoosh&quot;, in 1996. Since mid-2000 Boucher has lived in Nashville, United States, and has released four solo albums, &quot;Flutterby&quot; (October 2003), &quot;Scary Fragile&quot; (June 2009), a self-titled album (April 2012), and a 10th-anniversary celebration of &quot;Flutterby&quot; called &quot;Happy Birthday Flutterby&quot; (23 August 2014). Since 2008, Boucher has recorded material for Ten Out of Tenn, a Nashville-based music collective. Boucher is also a member of the pop rock trio Elle Macho.

==Biography==
Butterfly Giselle Grace Boucher was born on 2 June 1979 in Adelaide, the fourth of seven daughters. Her first name, Butterfly, was a suggestion from a friend of the family. Her parents are Vivienne, a ballet dancer, and Rodney &quot;Rod&quot; Boucher. Rod had a career as a professional singer/musician during the 1970s and 1980s specialising in Christian and rock music. Boucher&#x27;s sisters are Danielle Boucher (later a film director, actor, production designer), Rebecca Boucher Burns (now in band Belle of the Ball), Sunshine Boucher March (a ceramicist), Eden (born ca. 1981, member of Lovers Electric, and known for clothing design as &#x27;Eden honeydew&#x27;), Angelle (a former model), and Harmony (singer of Vuvuvultures and a Models 1 model). Her family travelled outback Australia during Boucher&#x27;s early years.

From the age of 15 years, Boucher played bass guitar for Eat the Menu (later renamed The Mercy Bell), which was formed in Brisbane in 1992 by her sister Becca on lead vocals, and Josh Thomson on guitars and backing vocals. In June 1996, Eat the Menu issued an album, &quot;Whoosh&quot;, with a line-up of Boucher, Becca, Thomson and Dale Rankine on drums. &quot;Whoosh&quot; was re-released a year later under the band&#x27;s new name, The Mercy Bell through Polydor records - but Boucher became disillusioned working with the major label, &quot;I don&#x27;t think they did any promotion for that first record. There weren&#x27;t even posters. It was like suddenly we were signed, but it didn&#x27;t change anything&quot;. Plans for the release of the second album never came into fruition due to the label being bought by Universal. In 1998, The Mercy Bell relocated to the United States – Nashville and signed to Interscope Records, Universal in Los Angeles. When the deal came to an abrupt end six months later due to Tom Whalley leaving to Warners the band played their last few shows in Nashville and moved to London, United Kingdom to seek new avenues. While The Mercy Bell was in hiatus, Boucher was working on her solo material, initially in Stockton, UK. By mid-2000, she had returned to live in Nashville. Thomson returned to Australia and Becca settled in the UK to form Belle of the Ball with her husband Benjamin Burns (jimmy Styles and the Easy Company) - in 2011 they performed a travelling &quot;lo-fi pop event&quot;, Burns Bistro.

On 7 October 2003, Boucher released her debut solo album, &quot;Flutterby&quot;, on Universal and A&amp;M Records. She co-produced and co-engineered it with Robin Eaton, Ron Fair, and Brad Jones at Alex the Great Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. AllMusic&#x27;s Robert L. Doerschuk described &quot;Flutterby&quot; as &quot;[a] low-key &quot;tour de force&quot;, [it] reflects an uncommon maturity and breadth of talent, particularly for a debut effort. Boucher commands all the essential instruments; more than that, she layers her parts with an ear toward sounding like a solid backup band, as opposed to showing off. Her lyrics, which adhere to the confessional/heartache model, can revolve around unanswered questions&quot;. The album peaked in the top 40 of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers. In the next month Boucher issued her first single off the album, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make Me&quot;, and followed with &quot;Another White Dash&quot;. The latter track had been written by Boucher, Becca and Thomson of The Mercy Bell, which appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Top 40. During 2004 Boucher toured the US and Europe, opening for Barenaked Ladies, and then for Sarah McLachlan on the latter&#x27;s Afterglow Tour.

Boucher started work on a second album, &quot;Scary Fragile&quot;, in 2005 and it was delivered to the A&amp;M label in January 2006. In February 2007 the track, &quot;A Bitter Song&quot;, from the album, featured on an episode of the TV series, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, it was available on iTunes for digital download on 27 February. After various delays due to producer, label and legal concerns &quot;Scary Fragile&quot; was released independently on 2 June 2009. Boucher reflected on her problems with major labels, &quot;[t]hat&#x27;s what was so frustrating. I had been there before and I managed to do it again ... I wasted those three years and lost my love of music in the process, trying to figure out what other people wanted&quot;. To promote the album&#x27;s appearance Boucher issued a single, &quot;Gun for a Tongue&quot;, in May and toured the US from May to July that year. In 2008 different Boucher family members contributed to the film, &quot;The Burial&quot;: Butterfly Boucher and Becca co-wrote two tracks which were performed by The Mercy Bell; Rod had the role as &#x27;The Priest&#x27;; Vivi was a catering manager; Danielle co-directed, co-designed, acted as &quot;The Mother&#x27; and co-wrote; Sunshine, Angelle and Harmony were catering assistants; and Eden co-designed production, acted as &#x27;Nurse&#x27; and designed costumers.

Boucher is part of the musical collective, Ten Out of Tenn, which formed in Nashville in 2005; since 2008 Boucher appeared on various compilation or Christmas albums including, &quot;Ten Out of Tenn Compilation (Vol. 2)&quot;, &quot;Ten Out of Tenn Christmas&quot; (both 2008), &quot;Any Day Now&quot; (2009), &quot;We Are all in This Together&quot; (2010) and &quot;Ten Out of Tenn Compilation (Vol. 4) &quot; (2011). In July and August 2010, McLachlan invited Boucher to perform on the renewed Lilith Fair tour, where Boucher met fellow Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, the pair share songwriting for a number of tracks including, &quot;Unashamed Desire&quot;. In 2011, Boucher and Brad Jones, co-produced Higgins&#x27; album, &quot;The Ol&#x27; Razzle Dazzle&quot; (June 2012), at Alex the Great Studios, Nashville. Both Boucher and Higgins recorded their own version of &quot;Unashamed Desire&quot;: Boucher&#x27;s appeared on her self-titled album which was released 13 April 2012, Higgins&#x27; version was issued as a single and appeared on &quot;The Ol&#x27; Razzle Dazzle&quot;. In 2011 Boucher toured with McLachlan, playing bass guitar and singing vocals. She also performs and records bass guitar and vocals as part of Elle Macho, a Nashville-based trio she formed with guitarist David Mead and drummer Lindsay Jamieson. Elle Macho will release their debut album on 5 February 2013. In August 2012, Boucher supported Higgins on an Australian tour that was followed, in September, by a tour of the US with Katie Herzig (fellow Ten out of Tenn member) added to the bill.

In October 2014, she released &quot;Happy Birthday Flutterby&quot; — a fully re-recorded version of her first album, &quot;Flutterby&quot;, on the occasion of its 10th anniversary. Unlike the original, which she recorded on her own, the remake enlisted help from other musicians, including Sarah McLachlan, Sara Bareilles, Katie Herzig.

== In media ==
Butterfly Boucher recorded a version of David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Changes&quot;, on the &quot;Shrek 2: Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, released in May 2004, for the film of the same name. Boucher&#x27;s own songs have been featured on various TV programs. In July to August 2004, the short-lived ABC series, &quot;The Days&quot; used &quot;Life is Short&quot; as its opening theme. TV drama series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; featured both &quot;Never Leave Your Heart Alone&quot; and &quot;Life is Short&quot; in its first season (2005), and debuted &quot;A Bitter Song&quot; from her then-unreleased album &quot;Scary Fragile&quot; in the third-season episode &quot;Drowning on Dry Land&quot; (2007). In addition, the title song &quot;Scary Fragile&quot; also featured in the pilot for the ABC Family show, &quot;Switched at Birth&quot;. The song &quot;Gun for a Tongue&quot; served as the theme song for &quot;The Lying Game&quot;.

&quot;Flutterby&quot; was the source of songs on the fantasy television series &quot;Charmed&quot;. &quot;Life is Short&quot; was used in the episode &quot;Spin City&quot;, and the episode &quot;Show Ghouls&quot; features a version of the track &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make Me&quot; remixed by Chris Lord-Alge, which is later included in soundtrack album, &quot;&quot;.

The single &quot;It Pulls Me Under&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Where We&#x27;re Meant to Be&quot; (2016) as well as the short film &quot;Break Free&quot; (2014) by Ruby Rose. Boucher later recorded and co-wrote an original song for the 2017 film &quot;Wonder&quot; entitled &quot;Break the Rules&quot;.

Boucher co-wrote several songs and appears on Dawson Wells&#x27; debut album &quot;Re: No Subject&quot;, for which she played instruments, including drums, guitar, piano and keyboards, tambourine and bass. She provided lead and backup vocals on most of the songs, including a duet with Dawson called &quot;Gracey and Henry Martin&#x27;s First Summer&quot;. Compositions she penned with Wells on that album are &quot;Say Anything&quot;, &quot;Silly One&quot;, &quot;Being in Love&quot;.

Her 2009 song, &quot;A Bitter Song&quot;, was sampled by New Orleans rap duo Suicideboys in their song, &quot;Kill Yourself III&quot;

<text>The Turan Depression, Turan Lowland or Turanian Basin is a low-lying desert basin region stretching from southern Turkmenistan through Uzbekistan to Kazakhstan.

==Geography==
The lowland region lies to the east of the Caspian Sea and southeast of the Aral Sea in the vast Aral–Caspian Depression but extends to parts above sea level as well. It is one of the largest expanses of sand in the world, covering an area of around 3 million km2. On average, the region receives less than of rainfall per year. The Karakum desert lies at the southern portion of the Turan Lowlands.

The part of the depression adjacent to the Aral Sea is drainless. It includes a network of temporary streams usually ending in &quot;sor&quot; salt flats, which seasonally become salt lakes.

Three of the largest cities in the Turan Depression are Daşoguz in Turkmenistan, Nukus in Uzbekistan, and Urganch, also in Uzbekistan. Vpadina Akchanaya in Turkmenistan is below sea level. The Amu Darya River runs in a southeast–north-westerly direction through the lowlands.

In the Pliocene and Pleistocene, the territory of the modern Turan depression was the bottom of the vast Turan Sea, which was divided into the modern Caspian and Aral seas about ten thousand years ago.

<doc id="1299781" wikidata="Q26961780" url="?curid=1299781" title="Hoxnian Stage">
<text>The Hoxnian Stage was a middle Pleistocene stage of the geological history of the British Isles. It was an interglacial which preceded the Wolstonian Stage and followed the Anglian Stage. It is equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS 11). Marine Isotope Stage 11 started 424,000 years ago and ended 374,000 years ago. The Hoxnian is divided into sub-stages Ho I to Ho IV. It is likely equivalent to the Holstein Interglacial in Central Europe.

== History ==
The Hoxnian Stage is named after Hoxne in the English county of Suffolk where some of the deposits created were first found. It was identified and dated with palynology or pollen evidence in the biostratigraphy and later updated with aminostratigraphic techniques. Based on stratigraphic information the Hoxnian happened after the Anglian glacial as Anglian soil is frequently found underneath Hoxnian deposits.

=== Similarly timed interglacials ===
The Hoxnian stage has often been correlated to the Holstein Interglacial of northern Continental Europe and the Mindel-Riss Interglacial of the Alps. However, there is ambiguity regarding the correlation of these two interglacials to either MIS 11 or MIS 9, which is related to the MIS 12 / MIS 10 ambiguity described in more detail in the article &#x27;Elster glaciation&#x27;. Recent luminenscence 

The Hoxnian stage has also been equated to the Yarmouthian (Yarmouth) Stage in North America. However, the Yarmouthian Stage, along with the Kansan, Nebraskan, and Aftonian stages, have been abandoned by North American Quaternary geologists and merged into the Pre-Illinoian Stage. At this time, the Hoxnian and Holstein stages are correlated with a brief part of the Pre-Illinoian Stage lying between the Pre-Illinoian A and Pre-Illinoian B glaciations of North America.

=== Humans ===
During the Hoxnian human activity was constrained by the dense forests so humans travelled along rivers and created settlements in valleys. The Beeches Pit site revealed humans possibly selected sites rich with flint for toolmaking.

== Environment ==
The Hoxnian is an interglacial phase meaning the warm periods in between glacial periods. Interglacial phases are heavily vegetated with woodlands interspersed with open areas. Site deposits are often found over Anglian soil which dates to MIS 12. Most sites have been found in valleys with signs of river deposits. During the interglacial the valleys would have been surrounded by dense forests.

=== Hoxnian sites ===
Beeches Pit, West Stow, Suffolk is a site dated to MIS 11 and under 40 km from other sites for the Lower Paleolithic and Middle Paleolithic. Beeches Pit is considered a site of special interest because not only were shells and plant remains found but animal bones that were burnt. The sites around Hitchin, Hertfordshire are associated with lakes caused by the melting of glaciers that settled in holes. When archaeologists dug up the sites they found dense soil full of gravel. The gravel is hypothesized to come from the creation of hand axes. At Marks Tey, Essex the lake soil was rich with pollen spanning all of the Hoxnian and remnants of gravel and artefacts.

<text>The Holden Sandman is a sports coupé utility produced between 1974 and 1980 by General Motors&#x27; Australian subsidiary Holden and became known throughout the 1970s as &quot;Shaggin&#x27; Wagons&quot;, given their popularity amongst teenage couples, identified by their bright paint jobs and distinguishable stripes, and later the colourful &quot;SANDMAN&quot; lettering covering the tailgate, the Sandman was Holden&#x27;s answer to a Panel Van and Utility variant of the popular GTS variants of the Sedan and Monaro Coupé, The sandman came standard with the GTS&#x27; sports style gauge cluster, sports steering wheel, bucket seats, along with a fully furnished interior, and the exterior consisting of rally wheels, GTS style guards, &quot;Sandman&quot; Logo painted on B pillars for utes and in approximately the same spot on panel vans and exclusive vinyl stripes, the Sandman came with a standard 173 cubic inch &quot;red&quot; inline 6, however most were optioned with either a 253, or 308 cubic inch Holden V8 (as Chevrolet small-block engines were not an option, unlike their GTS counterparts), backed by either a 4 speed manual (Standard) or 3 Speed &#x27;Tri-Matic&#x27; Automatic, both controlled through a console mounted floorshift.

Ford Australia released its XB Falcon Surferoo and Surfsider and later a range of Sundowner vans to try and take a share of the Sandman&#x27;s popularity, however did not succeed. Valiant-Chrysler Australia also released its CL Valiant Drifter, to similar praise.

The Sandman is often referred to among enthusiasts by its Production Order (PO) code, &quot;XX7&quot;.

== Holden Commodore Sandman ==

In 2015, the Sandman nameplate was revived with a limited edition version of the Commodore SportWagon and Ute decorated with HX-HZ style stripes, a custom &quot;Sandman&quot; dashpad, 20inch Baretta wheels and sheepskin seat covers, The Sandman was available in SV6 or SS V Redline spec, with a Holden High-Feature &quot;LFX&quot; V6, or for the latter, a Chevrolet &quot;LS3&quot; small-block V8.

<text>The Wolstonian Stage is a middle Pleistocene stage of the geological history of Earth from approximately 374,000 until 130,000 years ago. It precedes the Last Interglacial (also called the Eemian Stage) and follows the Hoxnian Stage in the British Isles. 

It is also approximately analogous to the Warthe and Saalian stages in northern Europe; the Riss glaciation in the Alps; and the Illinoian Stage in North America. The colder last part from around 194,000 years ago is called the Penultimate Glacial Period.

It is equivalent to Marine isotope stages (MIS) 10 through 6. MIS 10, 8 and 6 were glacial periods and 9 and 7 were interglacials.

It is named after Wolston in the English county of Warwickshire.

==Description==
The Wolstonian Stage is a middle Pleistocene stage of the geological history of Earth that precedes the Ipswichian Stage (Eemian Stage in Europe) and follows the Hoxnian Stage in the British Isles. The Wolstonian Stage apparently includes three periods of glaciation. The Wolstonian Stage is temporally analogous to the Warthe Stage and Saalian Stage in northern Europe and the Riss glaciation in the Alps, and temporally equivalent to all of the Illinoian Stage and the youngest part of the Pre-Illinoian Stage in North America. It is contemporaneous with the North American Pre-Illinoian A, Early Illinoian, and Late Illinoian glaciations.

The Wolstonian Stage is equivalent to Marine isotope stages 6 through 10.

Britain became an Island during this period (350,000 years ago). 

It started 374,000 years ago and ended 130,000 years ago.

==Etymology==
The Wolstonian Stage was named after the site of Wolston in the English county of Warwickshire where corresponding deposits were first identified.

==Archaeology==
Acheulian flint tools have been found in Wolstonian deposits.

<text>Lambert II, Count of Lens (died 1054) was a French nobleman. He was born about 1030 making him about 24 years old at his death in 1054.

He was the son of Eustace I, Count of Boulogne and of Maud of Louvain (daughter of Lambert I of Louvain). In 1053 he married Adelaide of Normandy, Countess of Aumale, daughter of Robert I, Duke of Normandy and sister of William the Conqueror. Adelaide was the widow of Enguerrand II, Count of Ponthieu who died in 1053. In 1054 Lambert and Adelaide had a daughter, Judith of Lens, although Lambert would scarcely have seen her, as he was killed at the battle of Lille in 1054. Lambert was at the battle supporting Baldwin V, Count of Flanders against Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. His widow, Adelaide, married, thirdly, Odo, Count of Champagne.

<text>Alexander Wendt (born 12 June 1958) is an American political scientist who is one of the core social constructivist researchers in the field of international relations, and a key contributor to quantum social science. Wendt and academics such as Nicholas Onuf, Peter J. Katzenstein, Emanuel Adler, Michael Barnett, Kathryn Sikkink, John Ruggie, Martha Finnemore, Erik Ringmar and others have, within a relatively short period, established constructivism as one of the major schools of thought in the field.

A 2006 survey of US and Canadian international relations scholars ranks Wendt as first among scholars who have &quot;been doing the most interesting work in international relations in recent years. A 2011 survey of international relations scholars worldwide ranked Wendt first in terms of having &quot;produced the best work in the field of IR in the past 20 years&quot;. Wendt won the Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science in 2023 together with Martha Finnemore.

== Biography ==
Alexander Wendt was born in 1958 in Mainz in West Germany, attended high school in St. Paul, Minnesota and studied political science and philosophy at Macalester College before receiving his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Minnesota in 1989, studying under Raymond &quot;Bud&quot; Duvall. Wendt taught at Yale University from 1989 to 1997, at Dartmouth College from 1997 to 1999, at the University of Chicago from 1999 to 2004, and is currently the Ralph D. Mershon Professor of International Security at the Ohio State University.

== &quot;Social Theory of International Politics&quot; ==
Wendt&#x27;s most widely cited work to date is &quot;Social Theory of International Politics&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1999), which builds on and goes beyond his 1992 article &quot;Anarchy is What States Make of It&quot;. &quot;Social Theory of International Politics&quot; places itself as a response to Kenneth Waltz&#x27;s 1979 work, &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot;, the canonical text of the neorealist school with Wendt centering states as the object of study and replicating Waltz&#x27;s division between international relations and foreign policy. Like Waltz, Wendt believed that the actual production that individuates states happens through domestic processes that require a separate theory from international relations; thus: &quot;Much of the construction is at the domestic level, as Liberals have emphasized, and a complete theory of state identity needs to have a domestic component.&quot;

Wendt&#x27;s book advances an argument of critical realism, and the ontological and methodological claims of constructivism. Critical realism, drawing upon the work of Roy Bhaskar (amongst others), seeks to explain un-observables within the world and constitutive questions of the world.

Constructivism, as imagined by Wendt, builds upon the work of Nicholas Onuf and Anthony Giddens, and argues for the mutual constitution of agents and structures, the historical contingency of cultures of anarchy, the role of constitutive and regulative norms in state behavior, the role of intersubjective social structures in identity, and the power of ideas. Anarchy, for Wendt, &quot;has no logic apart from process and that interaction structured, albeit not at a macro-level.&quot; There are three empirical cultures of anarchy in international relations: Hobbesian (where enmity dominates), Lockean (where rivalry dominates), and Kantian (where friendship dominates).

==&quot;Quantum Mind and Social Science&quot;==
Wendt&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;Quantum Mind and Social Science&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2015) postulates crossroads between quantum physics and social science. He advocates for panpsychism and quantum consciousness from a non-specialist perspective. The book is provocative in nature and has received varied reviews.

Mathias Albert in &quot;International Affairs&quot; explains the book as weakest in its attempts to link quantum physics to social science and behind the times in addressing the agent-structure problem, in addition to only marginally relating to international relations. The reviews within the book include Colin Wight&#x27;s &quot;Do I agree with it? No.&quot; and Jerome Busemeyer&#x27;s &quot;Some of these ideas may ultimately not be supported&quot;.

<text>Baikalfinansgrup () is a Russian limited liability company owned by Rosneft Oil Company. It is best known as the company that won the December 19, 2004 auction for a 76.79% share in Yuganskneftegaz, formerly the core production subsidiary of Yukos Oil Company. Baikalfinansgrup won the auction with a bid of 261 billion rubles (US$9.3 bn), which was somewhere between 37% and 49% of Yuganskneftegaz’ market value at the time, according to an appraisal made by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

==Profile==
Baikalfinansgrup was created on December 6, 2004, just two weeks before the Yuganskneftegaz auction, with a share capital of 10,000 rubles (US$358). Its original registered address was in the north-western Russian city of Tver in a building that houses a vodka bar, a mobile-phone shop, a tour operator agency and the offices of several small local companies, but no office of Baikalfinansgrup. Baikalfinansgrup later moved its legal address to the head office of Rosneft Oil Company, which is situated on Sofiyskaya Embankment directly opposite the Kremlin.

Despite its obscurity, Baikalfinansgrup was able to secure a credit of US$1.7 bn from the state-owned Sberbank savings bank as a down-payment for participating in the auction.

On December 21, 2004, Russian president Vladimir Putin admitted that he knew the owners of Baikalfinansgrup. Putin did not disclose their names, but noted that they were individuals with &quot;many years of experience in the energy business&quot;.

==Yuganskneftegaz auction==
Yuganskneftegaz was the core production subsidiary of Yukos Oil Company, which was previously run by Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2003, the Russian tax authorities charged Yukos and Khodorkovsky with large-scale tax evasion. On April 14, 2004, Yukos was presented with a bill for over US $35 bn in back taxes and a demand to pay the entire bill the same day. Requests by Yukos to defer payment, allow payment by instalments or to discharge the debt by sale of peripheral assets, including its shareholding in the Sibneft oil company, were also refused. Since Yukos was both legally and physically unable to pay the entire amount in cash on such short notice, Russian bailiffs froze Yukos’ shares in Yuganskneftegaz.

On November 19, 2004, Russian bailiffs placed a notice in the Russian government newspaper &quot;Rossiyskaya gazeta&quot; announcing that Yuganskneftegaz would be sold at an auctioned scheduled to be held 30 days later on December 19, 2004. The conditions for participation in the auction included an advance deposit of US $1.7 bn and prior clearance by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service.

In early December, the Russian state-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom submitted an application to participate in the auction through its wholly owned subsidiary, Gazpromneft. Gazpromneft had been created in September 2004 in preparation for a planned merger between Gazprom and state-owned Rosneft.

On December 15, 2004, Yukos filed for a bankruptcy protection in a Houston court, and obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting Gazprom from participating in the auction. On the next day, December 16, a group of Western banks withdrew their financial support for the Gazprom application. On the same day, the previously unknown Baikalfinansgrup applied to participate in the auction.

On December 19, 2004, only two companies appeared for the auction: Gazpromneft and Baikalfinansgrup. Gazpromneft declined to place any offer, thus allowing Baikalfinansgrup to acquire Yuganskneftegaz on its first bid.

Four days later Baikalfinansgrup was acquired by Rosneft. Rosneft later disclosed in its annual financial statement that it had financed the acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz. At the time, Rosneft president Sergey Bogdanchikov was also the CEO of Gazpromneft.

Shortly after the auction, the planned merger between Gazprom and Rosneft merger was called off, and Sergey Bogdanchikov resigned his post as CEO of Gazpromneft.

On February 7, 2006, in response to a question by a Spanish journalist, Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosed that Rosneft had used Baikalfinansgrup as a vehicle to acquire Yuganskneftegaz in order to protect itself against litigation risks.

<doc id="1299817" wikidata="Q3523906" url="?curid=1299817" title="Gas mark">
<text>The gas mark is a temperature scale used on gas ovens and cookers in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth of Nations countries.

==History==

Early gas ovens had no thermostats and it was up to the cook to continually adjust a manual valve to keep the oven at the desired temperature. For this and other reasons gas cookers were not popular; most users preferred the coal-fired open kitchen range. The breakthrough came in the 1920s when a manufacturer introduced the Regulo. REGULO was originally a proprietary name chosen by Radiation Ltd. to denote their new automatic temperature controller. In a series of press advertisements published on 13 May 1923 to announce their &quot;New World&quot; cooker it was stated that, by simply setting a pointer, the oven would go to the desired temeperature and stay there without requiring further attention. The current (2025) online edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; indicates that Radiation Ltd. applied to register &quot;Regulo&quot; as a trade mark in 1922; the same source cites &quot;The Economist&quot; (1936) as saying &quot;The ‘New World’ cooker, with the ‘Regulo’... revolutionised gas cooking&quot;. The pointer was calibrated in units of their own choosing, and since it was adopted by most gas cookers, Regulo has become generic as the name for the temperature scale itself.

The term &quot;gas mark&quot;, now synonymous with regulo, was a subject of the joint BBC/OED production &quot;Balderdash and Piffle&quot;, in May 2005. The earliest printed evidence of use of &quot;gas mark&quot; (with no other terms between the two words) appears to date from 1958.

==Equivalents in Fahrenheit and Celsius==
Gas mark 1 is 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius).

Oven temperatures increase by for each gas mark step. Above Gas Mark 1, the scale markings increase by one for each step. Below Gas Mark 1, the scale markings halve at each step, each representing a decrease of .

===Formulae===
In theory, the following formulae can be used to convert between gas mark values and Celsius.

For temperatures above 135 °C (gas mark 1), to convert gas mark to degrees Celsius (formula_1), multiply the gas mark number (formula_2) by 14, then add 121:

: formula_3

For the reverse conversion: 

: formula_4

These do not work for formula_2 less than 1, since the steps are given as halves (i.e., , ). For temperatures below 135 °C (gas mark 1), to convert gas mark to degrees Celsius apply the following conversion:

: formula_6

For the reverse: 

formula_7

Note that tables of temperature equivalents for kitchen use conventionally round Celsius values to the nearest 10 degrees, with steps of either 10 or 20 degrees between Gas Marks.

===Conversion table===
In practice, of course, a conversion table is used instead of the above formulae. The numbers in the conversion table below represent values that would actually be given in a recipe or set on a stove.

==Other cooking temperature scales==
===France: Thermostat===
French ovens and recipes use a scale called the &quot;Thermostat&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Th&quot;) that is based on the Celsius scale. Thermostat 1 equals 30 °C for conventional ovens, increasing by 30 °C for each whole number along the scale.

===Germany: Stufe===
In Germany, &quot;Stufe&quot; (the German word for &quot;step&quot;) is used for gas cooking temperatures. Gas ovens are commonly marked in steps from 1 to 8, corresponding to:

Other ovens may be marked on a scale of 1–7, where Stufe is about 125 °C in a conventional oven, Stufe 1 is about 150 °C, increasing by 25 °C for each subsequent step, up to Stufe 7 at 300 °C.

<text>Black Bullets, properly called Jesmona Black Bullets, are a confectionery produced by Maxons Ltd, a confectionery manufacturer from the English city of Sheffield. They are popular throughout the north of England, most notably in Newcastle, where it is said they gained a great deal of popularity with the local miners. The name Jesmona refers to the Jesmond area of Newcastle and is a registered trademark of Maxons Ltd.

Black Bullets are spherical, dark brown, peppermint-flavored boiled sweets. They contain only three ingredients: sugar, glucose, and peppermint oil. They are available either in tins of various sizes or individually wrapped in bags.

The tins are notable for their traditional decorative style which uses only black and white, with text reading &quot;Jesmona Old Fashioned Black Bullets.&quot;

<text>Yuganskneftegaz () is a wholly integrated subsidiary of Rosneft that owns and operates the second largest oil production complex in Russia. It was formerly the most important production subsidiary of Yukos, but was expropriated by the Russian government and given to Rosneft, a state-owned company.

==Background==
Yuganskneftegaz began operations in 1964, and saw significant upgrades in the 1990s that are responsible for bringing its production to their current levels. Yuganskneftegaz was formerly owned by Yukos, which was broken up and its principal assets sold off to satisfy tax debts allegedly totaling $28 billion. On 19 December 2004, Yuganskneftegaz was sold at a state-run auction, ostensibly to satisfy tax debts. The winning, and sole, bidder, was a little-known Russian oil company called Baikal Finance Group, who paid $9.7 billion. It was later revealed that the previously unheard-of Baikal Finance Group is a group of Kremlin insiders headed by Igor Sechin, Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration and a close associate of President Vladimir Putin. On 22 December 2004, Baikalfinansgrup was purchased by Rosneft, a wholly state-owned Russian oil company. Sechin has been Chairman of Rosneft&#x27;s Board of Directors since July 2004. The de facto nationalization of Yuganskneftegaz was denounced by Andrei Illarionov, then a senior Putin economic advisor, as &quot;the scam of the year.&quot;

==Complex==
Yuganskneftegaz is located in the Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug of Western Siberia. With of proven oil reserves, Yuganskneftegaz was the largest Yukos production complex. Yuganskneftegaz produces about of crude oil a day, about 60% of Yukos total, and about 1.6% of the world total. Its main oil fields are Priobskoye, Prirazlomnoye, Mamontovskoye, Malo-Balykskoye, and Salymskoye. According to the annual audit by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, as of 31 December 2006, Yuganskneftegaz&#x27; two largest fields, Priobskoye and Prirazlomnoye, contained 33% and 10.7% of Rosneft’s total proved reserves, respectively.

In 2005, Yuganskneftegaz built and began operating the Booster Pipeline Pumping Station (BPPS) at the Ust-Balykskoye field, six preliminary water removal units (PWRU) and two group pumping stations. In addition, it installed two electric substations and two overhead electric transmission lines stretching a total of . In 2006, Yuganskneftegaz began operating eight group pumping stations, an oil pumping station at the Prirazlomnoye field, another preliminary water removal unit, an external oil pipeline and six additional power generating stations. At the Priobskoye field, another oil production plant was set up and is now operating.

<text>The Discworld is the fictional world where English writer Sir Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; fantasy novels take place. It consists of an interstellar planet-sized disc, which sits on the backs of four huge elephants, themselves standing on the back of a world turtle, named Great A&#x27;Tuin, as it slowly swims through space.

The &quot;Disc&quot; is the setting for all forty-one Discworld novels; it was influenced by world religions which feature human worlds resting on turtles, as a setting to reflect situations on Earth, in a humorous way. The Discworld is peopled mostly by the three main races of men, dwarfs and trolls. As the novels progress, other lesser known races are included, such as dragons, elves, goblins and pixies.

Pratchett first explored the idea of a disc-shaped world in the novel &quot;Strata&quot; (1981).

==Great A&#x27;Tuin==
Great A&#x27;Tuin is the Giant Star Turtle (of the fictional species &quot;Chelys galactica&quot;) who travels through the Discworld universe&#x27;s space, carrying four giant elephants (named Berilia, Tubul, Great T&#x27;Phon, and Jerakeen) who in turn carry the Discworld. The narration has described A&#x27;Tuin as &quot;the only turtle ever to feature on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram&quot;.

Great A&#x27;Tuin&#x27;s sex is unknown to the inhabitants of Discworld (though in &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; Pratchett describes the turtle as male), but the subject of much speculation by some of the Disc&#x27;s finest scientific minds. The sex of the World Turtle is pivotal in proving or disproving a number of conflicting theories about the destination of Great A&#x27;Tuin&#x27;s journey through the cosmos. If, as the Discworld version of the popular &quot;Big Bang theory&quot; states, Great A&#x27;Tuin is moving from the Birthplace to the Time of Mating, then at the point of mating the civilisations of the Disc might be crushed, simply slide off, or else the entire world will end. The hypothesis is that all stars in the sky are also worlds carried by giant turtles, and that when all the turtles meet they will mate passionately, for the first and only time; from that mating, it is hypothesised that new turtles would be born to carry a new pattern of worlds. Attempts by telepaths to learn more about Great A&#x27;Tuin&#x27;s intents have not met with much success, mainly because they did not realise that its brain functions are on such a slow timescale. All they have been able to discern is that the Great A&#x27;Tuin is looking forward to something.

The other theory, described as being popular among the Discworld&#x27;s academics as the Discworld version of the steady state theory, which in-universe is known as the &quot;steady gait&quot; theory, is that Great A&#x27;Tuin came from nowhere and is going to keep swimming through space to nowhere forever. &quot;Eric&quot; shows Great A&#x27;Tuin being made instantly from nothing, seemingly in support of the &quot;steady gait&quot; theory; however, the events in &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, in which the Great A&#x27;Tuin attended the hatching of eight baby turtles, each with four baby elephants and a tiny discworld of their own, would seem to support the Big Bang hypothesis.

The little turtles have since gone off on their own journeys. Whether this was the event the Great A&#x27;Tuin was looking forward to or merely one step towards its ultimate goal is not mentioned.

Great A&#x27;Tuin has been mentioned to frequently roll on its belly to avoid asteroid and comet collisions, or even to snatch these projectiles out of the sky which might otherwise destroy the Disc. These stunts do not affect the Disc&#x27;s population, other than to induce severe seasickness on anyone who happens to be looking at the night sky at that time. A&#x27;Tuin has been known to do more complex rolls and corkscrews, but these are rarer. This is similar to real-world sea turtles&#x27; habit of rolling over with their shell down to protect themselves from sharks.

Due to the Great A&#x27;Tuin&#x27;s travelling through the universe, the night sky of the Discworld changes markedly over the course of decades, as the turtle departs older constellations and enters new ones. This means that astrologers must constantly update and alter their horoscopes to incorporate all-new zodiacs.

A tiny sun and moon orbit the Great A&#x27;Tuin, both about in diameter when described at the start of the series, but the description of their diameter is increased to at least later in the chronicles. The moon is slightly closer to the Disc than the sun. One half is covered with silvery glowing plants, which feed the lunar dragons. The other half is burnt black by the sun. The moon rotates and completes a full revolution in about a month; the full moon occurs when the luminescent side is completely visible from the Disc; the new moon when the dark side is shown. The sun&#x27;s orbit is so complex that one of the elephants has to cock its leg to allow the sun to continue on its orbit.

According to the wizards of Unseen University, &quot;Chelys galactica&quot;, and thus Great A&#x27;Tuin, are composed largely of the fictional element chelonium, the properties of which are apparently known to them (they do tests to look for it in Roundworld [the Discworld analogue of Earth] in &quot;The Science of Discworld&quot;), but not to readers.

==Magic==

Magic is the principal force in the Discworld and operates in a similar vein to real-world elemental forces such as gravity and electromagnetism. The Disc&#x27;s &quot;standing magical field&quot; is essentially the local breakdown of reality, which allows a flat planet on the back of a turtle to even exist. The force called &quot;magic&quot; is really just a function of the relative absence of reality in the local area, much in the same way that the absence of heat is described as &quot;coldness&quot;. Magic warps reality in much the same way as the real universe&#x27;s gravity warps its space-time. The act of performing magic is, essentially, telling the universe what form it must take, in terms that the universe cannot ignore. This is very draining to magic users, due to Discworld science&#x27;s Law of Conservation of Reality, which states that magic and mundane methods require the same energy expenditure. This is why most Discworld wizards store magic in a staff, which is a sort of capacitor for magical energy.

On the Discworld, where magic has more in common with particle physics than Houdini, high-level background magic (most likely a reference to real-world background radiation) occurs when a very powerful spell hits, creating myriad sub-astral particles that severely distort local reality. Building a house in (or even walking into) a region where this has happened is extremely dangerous, as it is mentioned that an individual may not remain the same species, shape or level of sanity as they were when they entered. Medium levels cause odd effects, such as coins landing on their edges and turning into caterpillars. Areas with larger than normal quantities of background magic tend to display unusual qualities, even for the Disc. Very high quantities of magic can knock a hole in Discworld reality, leading to an invasion by Lovecraftian monstrosities from the Dungeon Dimensions, or, almost as bad, the world of the Elves.

In the Discworld universe, magic is broken into elementary particulate fragments in much the same way that energy and other forces are in real-world quantum physics. The basic unit of Discworld magic is the thaum (from the Greek &quot;thauma&quot;, marvel), equal to the amount of mystical energy required to conjure up one small white pigeon, or three normal-sized billiard balls. Several SI-modifiers have been applied to it (e.g. millithaum, kilothaum) in the books. Magic can be measured with a thaumometer, which is described as a black cube with a dial on one side. A standard thaumometer is good for up to a million thaums, beyond that level, Discworld reality starts to break down. Parodying the introduction of the metric system, later Discworld novels refer to the introduction of the newer unit, the Prime, to avoid arguments over the standard sizing of pigeons. It is defined as the magical energy required to move one pound of lead one foot, referencing the Joule.

The thaum also appears to be a particle, the Discworld physics equivalent of the atom. &quot;Splitting the thaum&quot; revealed that it was in fact composed of numerous sub-particles, called resons (&quot;thingies&quot;) which in turn are created from a combination of up to five &quot;flavours&quot;: up, down, sideways, sex appeal, and peppermint (parodying the real-world quarks).

In the opening books, the number eight is significant and has magical properties on the Disc, (e.g. the number of the colour of Magic, octarine) and should never be spoken by wizards, especially in certain places. Doing so may allow the ancient dungeon dimension creature &quot;Bel-Shamharoth the sender of eight&quot; to break through (this is taken to an extreme end in one book, as even the &quot;narrator&quot; takes great pains to avoid saying the word). On the other hand, eight turns up in many places one would expect the number seven in the real world (e.g. the Discworld week contains eight days, not seven). After &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, both the colour and the number eight no longer appear as dangerous.

The Disc&#x27;s magical field is centred on Cori Celesti. Everyday natural forces, such as light and magnetism, are muffled by the power of the Disc&#x27;s magical field, and rather than a magnetised needle, navigators on the Disc use a compass with a needle of the magical metal octiron, which will always point towards Cori Celesti. Light is so oddly affected by magic that, as it passes into the Disc&#x27;s atmosphere, it actually slows down from millions to hundreds of miles an hour. One odd effect of this is that the Disc has time zones, however, as a flat world, it should not. Another effect is that, as reported in &quot;Thud!&quot;, the red- and blue-shifting of light becomes noticeable when travelling at speeds of merely a .

===The Power of Belief===
Reality is spread thinly on the Disc, so events may be affected by expectations, especially those of &#x27;intelligent&#x27; species such as humans, dwarfs, etc. As such, the Discworld is not governed by real-world physics or logic but by belief and narrative resolution. Essentially, if something is believed strongly enough, or by enough people, it may become true. Jokes such as treacle mines and drop bears are real on the Disc. In reality lemmings do not actually rush &quot;en masse&quot; off cliffs; on the Disc, they do, because that is what people believe. These concepts of Discworld physics are also exploited in both wizard and witch magic. For example, when a character wishes to turn a cat into a human, the easiest way is to &quot;convince&quot; the cat, on a deep level, that he is a human. In fact, the main reason the Auditors of Reality dislike sentient beings in the Discworld universe is that the Auditors are the personifications of the real-world laws of physics, but the Discworld physics&#x27; power of belief and the humans&#x27; ignorance constantly remake the world, making their work fruitless.

More significantly, it is also belief that gives Discworld&#x27;s gods their powers. Discworld gods start off as tiny spirits, and gain power as they gain believers; this is explored most thoroughly in &quot;Small Gods&quot;. A similar effect has led to the personalisation and &quot;reification&quot; in the Discworld universe of mythological beings symbolising abstract concepts, such as Death, the Hogfather and other anthropomorphic personifications. In &quot;Hogfather&quot;, the assassin Mr. Teatime tries to kill the patron of Hogswatch by using an old magic that involves controlling a person with a part of their body (in this case, the teeth collected by the Tooth Fairies), in order to stop children from believing in him, and almost succeeds. It is also possible for humans to gain godly powers through the power of belief, typically venerated rulers such as the Kings of Djelibeybi as seen in &quot;Pyramids&quot;, and the Duchess Annagovia of Borogravia in &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;. It is possible for gods to derive power from misotheists, as demonstrated in &quot;Small Gods&quot; when Om takes a liking to the ardently anti-Omnianist Sergeant Simony. As demonstrated in &quot;Faust Eric&quot; and &quot;Mort&quot;, personal belief determines someone&#x27;s fate in the afterlife, rather than divine judgement, whether it is going to paradise or Hell, or being reincarnated.

Such is the nature of belief on the Disc that temporary new gods come into being on a regular basis, and often for such mundane things as stuck drawers; Anoia, Goddess of Things That Get Stuck in Drawers, came into her powers in such a manner, though she was previously a volcano goddess.

===Narrative causality===
The Disc&#x27;s nature is fundamentally teleological; its basic composition is determined by what it is ultimately &quot;meant&quot; to be. This primary element, out of which all others spring, is known as narrativium, the elemental substance of Story. Nothing on the Disc can exist without a Story first existing to mould its destiny and determine its form. This is, perhaps, a take on the fact that nothing can ever &quot;happen&quot; on the Disc unless it is written in a story by Terry Pratchett. On the Disc, if a story or legend is told often enough and believed by enough people, it becomes true. This is known as the law of narrative causality.

For example, characters in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; describe the marauding (noble) dragon as an &quot;impossible&quot; creature, yet it is able to fly and breathe fire because that is what dragons are &quot;expected to do&quot;. Similarly, a witch gone bad may meet a bad end after building a house of gingerbread. If a miller has a third son, he will invariably leave him only his cat. A hero will always win when outnumbered, since million-to-one chances are dramatic enough to &quot;crop up nine times out of ten&quot;, but always lose when faced with &quot;a little bald wrinkly smiling man&quot; who is almost always highly trained in martial arts.

Discworld witches often employ narrative in their magic, but consider it ethically tricky since it interferes with free will. Discworld wizards avoid doing so because narrative that severely strains credibility requires outright sources of magic to feed on, sometimes indiscriminately. Knowledge of stories, their use and how to change them forms the basis of many forms of magical power in Discworld physics. Pratchett characters who use or change stories include Lilith, Black Aliss, and Granny Weatherwax. The habit of many Discworlders to take metaphor literally has combined with the power of belief to produce some very odd areas on the Discworld. The Place Where The Sun Does Not Shine, for instance, is a deep crevasse in Lancre, incidentally located between A Rock and A Hard Place.

===Octarine===
The colour of magic on the Discworld, also referred to as the &quot;eighth colour&quot;. This fictional colour is strongly indicative of magic and can only be seen by wizards and cats, who both possess &quot;octagon cells&quot; in addition to the normal cones and rods possessed by humans. (See tetrachromacy for the real-world equivalent.). Rincewind, a wizard, describes it as resembling a fluorescent greenish-yellow purple.

===Substances===
The Disc contains magical substances. One such is octiron, a dense black metal that is a large part of the Discworld&#x27;s crust. Its melting point is above the range of metal forges. The gates of Unseen University are made out of it, as is Old Tom, the university&#x27;s bell. It is used to make magic needles and bells. It releases magical radiation, but if it becomes negatively polarised, it can be used to absorb such radiation. It generates significant amounts of heat under pressure, accounting for most of the volcanic geological processes on Discworld. When struck (such as with Old Tom), instead of producing a sound it briefly silences anything around it.

Another is fingles, insinuated in &quot;Eric&quot; to be an important part of human psychology. Their absence, according to the Creator, can cause psychological problems. &quot;On the surface they were all right, but deep down they knew something was missing&quot;, as he put it, referring to the inhabitants of a world where he forgot to include any. Since fingles do not exist on Earth, it is implied that Earth is the planet the Creator is referring to, and humanity is the species that is fundamentally incomplete because of their absence.

Another is slood. First mentioned in &quot;The Last Continent&quot;, slood is a natural substance that could be discovered by intelligent beings, but that humans on Earth have been too unintelligent to find; it is said to be much easier to discover than fire, and only slightly harder to discover than water. One of Rincewind&#x27;s many accumulated positions is Reader in Slood Dynamics. The General Theory of Slood was discovered by Archchancellor Sloman, and a stained glass window representing this event is in the meeting room of the Unseen University college council. The University&#x27;s plumbing system contains pipes for maintaining slood differential.

==The Disc==
The Disc itself is described as roughly wide, giving it a surface area two-fifths that of the Earth, which would make it roughly the size of the Pacific Ocean. In addition to its flatness, Pratchett gives it another principal geographic feature; Cori Celesti, a mountain that lies at its exact centre and is the point of origin for its standing magical field. Cori Celesti is also the location of Dunmanifestin, the home of many of the Disc&#x27;s gods and the Discworld analogue of real-world Greek mythology&#x27;s Mount Olympus. The area surrounding Cori Celesti is known as The Hub, a land of high, icebound mountains that serves as an analogue to the real-world Himalayas, polar regions (since, although the Disc has no poles as such, it is as far as possible from the Disc&#x27;s edge and thus the sun), and Scandinavia – the Hublanders share many features with Vikings. Polar bears are renamed &quot;Hubland bears&quot;, while the Disc&#x27;s equivalent of the aurora borealis (described as being produced by the Disc&#x27;s magical field, rather than by magnetism) is known as the &quot;Aurora Coriolis&quot;.

The areas closer to the Rim are warmer and tropical, since the Disc&#x27;s sun passes closer to them in its orbit. At the Rim, a great, encircling waterfall (the Rimfall) sends the Disc&#x27;s oceans cascading into space. Pratchett is evasive about how the water eventually returns to refill the oceans, only saying, &quot;Arrangements are made.&quot; The mist from the plunging waters creates the Rimbow, an eight-colour (the eighth is octarine) double rainbow consisting both of light and of magic.

Cardinal directions within the Discworld are not given as North, South, East and West, but rather as directions relating to the disc itself: &quot;Hubward&quot; (towards the centre), &quot;Rimward&quot; (away from the centre) and to a lesser extent, &quot;turnwise&quot; (direction of the disc&#x27;s rotation) and &quot;widdershins&quot; (against the direction of the disc&#x27;s rotation). The drawing on the front cover of &quot;Jingo&quot; shows a weathercock fitted with the requisite &quot;H&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot; and &quot;W&quot; letters. The disc rotates clockwise as seen from above.

===Circle Sea===
The Circle Sea is an almost landlocked body of water approximately halfway between the Hub and the Rim, opening at the turnwise side into the Rim Ocean. The Circle Sea is analogous to the Mediterranean Sea, in that it is bordered both by countries on the Sto Plains (Europe) and continent of Klatch (Middle East, North Africa). Its principal trading ports are Ankh-Morpork and Al Khali and Ephebe on the Rimwards side. The countries around the Circle Sea are Ankh-Morpork, Ephebe, Djelibeybi, Klatch, Omnia and Tsort. The Circle Sea is the location of Leshp, an island that occasionally rises to the surface on a cushion of foul-smelling gas, before settling back to the seafloor once more. Leshp&#x27;s last appearance sparked a near-war between Ankh-Morpork and Klatch in &quot;Jingo&quot;.

===Unnamed Continent===
The unnamed continent is the one on which most of the books are set. It is essentially the analogue of Europe, and contains among other things the Sto Plains and Ramtops, as well as the more Eastern European lands around Überwald.

====Sto Plains====
The Sto Plains are the rough analogue to Western Europe on the Discworld. They are a land of rich black loam, upon which rests a great squat forest of cabbages. In &quot;Soul Music&quot;, a footnote states various facts of the region:
*Principal export: Cabbages
*Flora: Cabbages
*Fauna: Things that eat cabbages and do not mind not having any friends.
The cabbage has an almost mythic status among the people of the Sto Plains, and is an emblem of its largest and dominant city, Ankh-Morpork, which is located near the northeast of the coat of arms. Many young people who leave the farming areas of the Plains for life in the big city would happily never see a cabbage again.

Although they have been an empire in the past, the Sto Plains currently exist as a loose collection of independent city-states, ruled over by a close-knit (and probably interrelated) ruling class. The Sto Plains could be thought of as being similar to Germany prior to the unification of the states into the German Empire, with no overall authority. According to &quot;Mort&quot; the area was to be united in the coming decades. As reality was given a retcon in the book, the Duke who united the Sto Plains was Mort, and he did it by diplomacy rather than conquest.

====Ankh-Morpork====

The principal city of the Sto Plains is Ankh-Morpork. While it does not exert any political power over its neighbors, its economic domination of the region (summed up by the phrase, &quot;Attack us, and we&#x27;ll call in your mortgages&quot;) has meant that the smaller cities around it are essentially its satellites. For some reason, the coat of arms has a hippo on each side.

====Pseudopolis====
Pseudopolis (its name translates to &quot;false city&quot;) is first mentioned in the first &quot;Discworld&quot; novel, &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;. That novel also refers to Psephopololis, which according to &quot;The Discworld Mapp&quot; is the same place. The city is not to be confused with Pseudopolis Yard, the headquarters of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (a reference to Scotland Yard). Pseudopolis possesses a school of magic, Braseneck College (a parody of Brasenose College, Oxford), which is apparently in competition for prestige with the larger, older Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork. In fact, the novel &quot;Raising Steam&quot; makes clear that this rivalry extends to the city level, as Pseudopolis refuses to accept an Ankh-Morpork-constructed trainline. As of &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;, the aristocracy of the city appear to have undertaken an experiment in representative democracy, much to Lord Vetinari&#x27;s amusement.

While no &quot;Discworld&quot; novels have been set in Pseudopolis, a number of characters have roots there. Eric Thursley lives/lived at 13 Midden Lane (&quot;Faust Eric&quot;). Charlie, a man with an extraordinary physical resemblance to Ankh-Morpork Patrician Havelock Vetinari, ran a clothes shop there (&quot;The Truth&quot;). Nobby Nobbs had an early career as an armourer in one of the Pseudopolis city militias; curiously (and this may be no more than a coincidence, although there may be a connection given Nobby&#x27;s penchant for nicking and flogging [i.e., stealing and selling]
anything not nailed down), Pseudopolis always lost its wars at this period because of an unaccountable shortage of weapons. John Keel, a city watchman, moved from Pseudopolis to Ankh-Morpork and was the mentor of the young Sam Vimes (&quot;Night Watch&quot;).

====Quirm====
Quirm is the location of the Quirm College for Young Ladies (formerly attended by Susan Sto Helit) and the birthplace of Leonard of Quirm (the Disc&#x27;s Leonardo da Vinci). It is a quiet and peaceful town, and for this reason is a popular holiday destination. It is also where Morporkians go when they retire (including Lord Vetinari&#x27;s aunt, Lady Roberta Meserole). In this regard, it relates to Ankh-Morpork as Eastbourne relates to London, or possibly as Spain relates to the United Kingdom, or even Greece (as a description in &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot; describes Quirm as having &quot;strange water&quot;, which is the typical stereotype of the Greek water supply).

The Quirmian language is occasionally described as similar to French or Spanish, but &quot;Snuff&quot; notes that all Quirmians speak perfect Morporkian. Spoken Quirmian in &quot;Making Money&quot;, is identical to French. In &quot;Raising Steam&quot;, the Marquis des Aix en Pains speaks Morporkian with a French accent.

Quirm is famous for its floral clock: a circle of flowers, each of which opens its petals at a different hour. Quirm is also famous for its (blue-veined) cheese. Quirmian cuisine is generally characterised by &quot;avec&quot; (French for &quot;with&quot;).

Quirm is a duchy ruled by the Rodley family. Members of this family include Lord Rodley, an upper-class twit in &quot;Mort&quot;, and Brenda Rodley, a swamp dragon-breeding dowager duchess in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;. In &quot;Sourcery&quot;, Quirm was destroyed by wizards in a magic war, but presumably restored by Coin when he put everything back as it had been before the war.

Susan Sto Helit, Lady Sybil Ramkin and Miss Perspicacia Tick were educated at the Quirm College for Young Ladies. The school&#x27;s headmistress and founder is Miss Eulalie Butts (possibly a reference to Frances Buss). It is explained in &quot;Soul Music&quot; that few of the Discworld&#x27;s higher-class schools (such as the Ankh-Morpork Assassins&#x27; Guild School) will admit female students (although the Assassins have since changed this policy), so Miss Butts founded the College &quot;on the astonishing principle that, since gels had nothing much to do until someone married them, they might as well occupy the time with learning things.&quot;

The school resembles a traditional English independent girls&#x27; school, with an academic curriculum and heavy emphasis on respectable and decent behaviour. Students at the school do not seem to be preparing for any particular profession. Susan Sto Helit describes it as &quot;an education in, well, education&quot; (&quot;Hogfather&quot;). It appears that those students who do not marry upon leaving school generally go into the teaching profession themselves, or become governesses.

====Sto Lat====
Sto Lat, ruled by Queen Kelirehenna, is located about from Ankh-Morpork.

According to the books, Sto Lat is a sizable walled town in the Sto Plains, although eclipsed enormously both in size and influence by the neighbouring city of Ankh-Morpork. Sto Lat is the nearest major city to Ankh-Morpork (approximately a half day&#x27;s journey by horse, less if the horse is Boris from &quot;Going Postal&quot;) and to which it is connected by two clacks towers. It encompasses a large boulder emerging out of the Sto Plains like &#x27;a geological pimple&#x27;, left there by the retreating Ice Giants. The castle is built into this rock.

Its most recent king before the present monarch was King Olerve, who was shot with a crossbow by an assassin hired by the original Duke of Sto Helit, a thoroughly nasty man who staged a bid for the succession, thwarted only by Mort in &quot;Mort&quot;. At the end of &quot;Mort&quot;, Princess Keli became Queen.

Politically, Sto Lat is the capital of a kingdom ruled by Queen Kelirehenna, which includes Sto Helit, Sto Kerrig, and the Eight Protectorates. Her authority is exercised through a Mayor. The kingdom was one of the first places outside Ankh-Morpork to adopt its own stampings for the post.

Astolat is a legendary location in Arthurian mythology, and &quot;Sto lat&quot; is also a traditional Polish song equivalent to &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; (&quot;sto lat&quot; literally means &quot;hundred years&quot;).

Sto Helit is a duchy within Sto Lat, which was given to Mort in &quot;Mort&quot;, after he&#x27;d saved Queen Kelirehenna. After his death in &quot;Soul Music&quot;, his duchy apparently was passed to his daughter, Susan. She works as a teacher now, but, apparently, as of &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, she still is duchess of Sto Helit.

====Ramtops====
The Ramtops are the Discworld&#x27;s principal mountain range. Across their vast extent, from the Hub to the Rim, they incorporate elements from virtually every noted mountain range of Earth, from the Scottish Highlands (Lancre) to the Himalayas (the High Tops) to Appalachia (Slice). They are the Disc&#x27;s main magical conduit, as they lie like a metal rod across the centre of the Disc&#x27;s magical field (indeed, the source of the field, the Cori Celesti, is technically part of the Ramtops), and are thus alive with unreality. Portals to various otherworlds dot the range&#x27;s hidden crevices; &quot;gnarly ground&quot; compresses vast areas of land into tiny patches, and where witches, wizards, and godlike monks alike practice their arts.

Kingdoms in the Ramtops tend to be small, isolated, and sparsely populated. Much of the economy is agrarian and communities largely consist of loosely affiliated groups of self-sufficient farms. The Ramtops are known for their harsh winters; snow drifts can rise up to during the worst storms. &quot;Ramtoppers have 18 words for snow,&quot; Pratchett says, &quot;&quot;none of them printable&quot;.&quot;

Pratchett mentioned that the name of the Ramtops comes from &quot;RAMTOP&quot; (i.e. top of RAM, or random-access memory), a system variable in the ZX Spectrum computer.

====Lancre====
Lancre is situated in the Ramtop mountains, about Hubwards of the city of Ankh-Morpork. It is the best-known of hundreds of tiny countries in the Ramtops, occupying a vertiginous shelf looking over the Sto Plains.

Lancre is based on rural southern England. In an article in &quot;Folklore&quot; entitled, &#x27;Imaginary Worlds, Real Stories,&#x27; Pratchett writes, &quot;the kingdom of Lancre [...] I suspect is a somewhat idealised version of the little fold in the Chiltern Hills where I grew up, stirred in with the western area of the Mendips where I spent a great deal of my adult life.&quot; Pratchett described the tiny country as &quot;solid folklore&quot;; it is the place all the legends of Earth&#x27;s countryside &quot;really happened&quot;. Ankh-Morpork serves a similar function for urban folklore, but not as blatantly. The name seems to echo Lancashire (with the inhabitants called &quot;Lancrastians&quot;) and the associated witch trials in Pendle there in the seventeenth century.

Part of the reason for Lancre&#x27;s mystical quality is that the Ramtops are a major earthing point for the Discworld&#x27;s magical field. Lancre is famous for witches, especially since the publication of &quot;The Joye of Snackes&quot;, an erotic cookbook by &quot;A Lancre Witch&quot;, i.e. Nanny Ogg. 
Lancre is also famous for is young people going off and seeking their fortunes, usually in Ankh-Morpork. Lancre is also the physical location for (possibly two) independent gateways to a &quot;parasite universe&quot; inhabited by Elves.

Most maps show Lancre as roughly , its true area remains unknown – partly because of its mountainous terrain and the fact that it borders on the Ramtops, but also due to the warping effect of high level of background magic. Geography in parts of Lancre can take on additional properties that exist either outside, or in addition to, the conventional geographic dimensions. These areas include the Lancre moors, where reality can become folded into deep troughs and ridges known as &quot;gnarly ground&quot;. The effect, as mentioned in &quot;The Discworld Companion&quot; is that Lancre contains more landscape than a kingdom of its apparent size should be able to contain (a similar magical effect occurs in the Unseen University Library, which has a diameter of 100 yards, but an infinite radius). &quot;Gnarly ground&quot; can be detected by those with magical senses, or those with keen eyesight who observe how clouds and shadows appear to fracture as they pass across it. Flying over such areas is not for the faint-hearted and walking across it can be fraught with peril. Similarly, Lancre contains areas where the landscape echoes the state of mind of those who pass through, leading confident travellers to find babbling brooks while, in the same place at the same time, disheartened travellers find deep valleys and raging mountain torrents.

In times past, Elven incursions were common. Both gateways have been sealed from the Lancre side by standing stones made from thunderbolt iron, a meteoric ore which is one of the few sources of magnetism on the Disc; humans, but not Elves (except in exceptional circumstances), may pass through them.

The capital of Lancre is Lancre Town, slightly bigger than the other villages, and containing Lancre Castle. Bad Ass is the home of Granny Weatherwax. It got its name when a donkey, carrying the supplies of a group of settlers, stopped on a ford and refused to move, forcing them to build their town there. The valley occupied by Bad Ass overlooks a panorama of lesser mountains and foothills. From there, one can see to the edge of the world. In the long winter snows, the roads out of the village are lined with boards to reduce drifting and to stop travellers from straying. A narrow bridge over a stream leads to the village smithy, birthplace of Eskarina Smith.

====Hublands====
The lands around the Hub, also called the High Tops, are icy, mountainous and cold. They are also the areas closest to the Cori Celesti, and so are crackling with magic. They are roughly equivalent to Earth&#x27;s Himalayas, being home to Yeti and various Buddhist-style monastic orders, such as the History Monks, which give the area the nickname &quot;Enlightenment Country&quot;. The Hublands are also the closest thing the Disc has to a pole, and so are home to its equivalent of polar bears and walruses, mentioned in &quot;The Last Hero&quot;.

====Überwald====

Überwald () is a region located near the foot of the Ramtops, farther from Ankh-Morpork than Lancre is.

Its name is German for &quot;&quot;over the woods&quot;, a play on Transylvania (which is Latin for &quot;across the woods&quot; - a name actually used for Transylvania in some 13th century writings). The region is based less on the real Eastern Europe, and more on the Hammer Horror stereotype of the area. In keeping with the Discworld&#x27;s affinity for narrative, Überwald&#x27;s climate and conditions contrive to fulfill human expectations: for example, Überwaldian thunderclaps occur whenever someone makes a particularly forceful pronouncement. In &quot;The Truth&quot; this phenomenon is referred to as &quot;psychotropic weather&quot;.

The spelling of the German-language word is certainly &quot;Überwald&quot;. The usage in some of the books is uneven, but the later narratives use &quot;Uberwald&quot;&quot; exclusively. In &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;, Pratchett writes:

The region was previously united under the rule of the Unholy Empire (a play on the Holy Roman Empire), which had a two-headed bat as its symbol (a play on the double headed eagle). The Empire has long since collapsed leaving the area fragmented, chaotic, and under the rule of lore, not law.

Although Überwald has a large human population, they play a secondary role in the region&#x27;s history. It is ruled by dwarfs, vampires, and werewolves. Sergeant (later Captain) Angua of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is from an old aristocratic family of Überwald werewolves. While there are indeed a number of human barons, they all tend to be uninterested in politics, preferring instead to dabble in experimental surgery and &quot;&quot;Meddling In Things Man Was Not Meant To Wot Of&quot;,&quot; each with the help of their personal Igors.

From the &#x27;Diet of Bugs&#x27; (a play on the Diet of Worms) onwards garlic and silver were considered contraband across Überwald until the events of &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;; the undead simply promised they would not be needed. Apparently this system left something to be desired. However, following interference by werewolves in the coronation of the Low King of the Dwarfs, dwarfish restrictions on silver mining were lifted.

Überwald&#x27;s economy is apparently based on mining. Though precious metals are plentiful, the most crucial mineral resource is fat, which is believed to have been deposited by a fifth great Discworld-bearing elephant, which was dislodged from the back of Great A&#x27;Tuin and crashed into the ground around Überwald. Boiling fat rising to the surface is the reason for the country&#x27;s many hot springs.

Überwald effectively comprises two utterly distinct societies; the dwarfs (who exist below in their cavernous cities and tunnels), and everybody else, who lives above on the surface. By tradition, the laws of the surface people do not apply underground, and vice versa. Überwaldian dwarfs are far more hidebound and traditional than their cousins near the Sto Plains, which has led to a certain culture clash between the two (cf. marching season). Überwald is the centre of Dwarfish history and politics; the Low King, the final arbiter of Dwarfish law, has his seat of power in the underground Überwald city of Schmaltzberg (literally &quot;mountain of fat&quot;; a double or even triple play on the Austrian town of Salzburg: Schmaltz means lard or fat in German, but can also mean &#x27;excessive sentimentality&#x27;).

Koom Valley is a location somewhere in Überwald. Hundreds of years ago, the trolls and the dwarfs met in a battle at Koom Valley in which each side apparently ambushed the other. Nowadays, dwarfs celebrate the Battle of Koom Valley Day, on the same day that trolls celebrate Troll New Year. Sometimes, in a city where both dwarfs and trolls live (e.g. Ankh-Morpork), the two groups are careful enough to plan their celebratory marches so that they are on the same street. Some people (e.g. Susan Sto Helit), after carefully studying history books, point out that the Battle of Koom Valley seemed to have been repeated several times. The name comes from the Welsh word &quot;cwm&quot;, which means &quot;valley&quot;.

In Unseen Academicals, it is suggested that Uberwald is developing and moving closer to Ankh-Morpork thanks to the vampire Lady Margalotta. It also suggests that the Emperor of Uberwald was an evil sorcerer, who created orcs, some of whom survived up to the present, giving rise to Mr. Nutt.

====Borogravia====
Borogravia is located Rimwards of Überwald, on the Discworld&#x27;s unnamed main continent. The capital city is PrinceMarmadukePiotreAlbertHansJosephBernhardtWilhelmsberg. Borogravia is a Duchy, and as such is ruled by a Duke or Duchess. The ruler at the time of &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; was Duchess Annagovia, who has achieved virtual godhood among the people.

Borogravia is an extremely backward and reactionary nation, whose laws are defined by their god Nuggan. Nuggan dictates &quot;abominations&quot;, which are things that have been banned by him, to his worshippers via the &quot;Book of Nuggan&quot;, a &quot;living testament&quot; in which new &quot;abominations&quot; appear &quot;religiously&quot; from Nuggan, with the necessity of adding fresh pages making it the only holy book to be kept in a ring binder. These enforcements can be very impractical and inconvenient, such as banning chocolate, Borogravia&#x27;s main export; depictions of living things (apart from the Duchess); babies (this law is usually overlooked); crop rotation; and any means of airborne communications (namely semaphore and carrier pigeon). The banning of semaphore led to the Borogravians cutting down the clacks towers along the Zlobenian border, which was one of the main causes of war between the two nations (with intermittent conflict going on for so long that no-one can remember why it is actually happening), and the reason for Ankh-Morporkian diplomatic intervention. Perhaps the most militarily aggressive nation on the Disc, Borogravia is known for invading its neighbours and fighting wars (in &quot;Night Watch&quot;, it is mentioned in passing that Borogravia has invaded Mouldavia), with the army being regarded as the only effective branch of government. However, it struggles to keep up with this demand because of its crippled economy (caused by highly inconvenient &quot;abominations&quot;), and as a result of fighting the country is seriously short of young men, so much that a proportion of its soldiers are in fact women in disguise (see &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;). At the beginning of the novel, aspects of modern society such as police services and newspapers are alien concepts to Borogravians, with Nugganatic laws being enforced by &#x27;citizen&#x27;s committees&#x27;, and the government being the sole disseminator of information to the public.

The Borogravian national currency is the crown, whose subunits include shillings, sixpences and pennies.

====Zlobenia====
Zlobenia, a pun on Slovenia, with its capital Rigour, a pun on Riga, is a principality ruled by Prince Heinrich, who is described as tall, handsome, and smug. It has fought numerous wars with Borogravia, usually territorial disputes over the River Kneck, which forms the border between the two nations and frequently changes its course after flooding. Worship of Nuggan was banned in Zlobenia without much objection. Zlobenia&#x27;s soldiers wear blue uniforms. Borogravians call Zlobenians &#x27;swede eaters&#x27;. Heinrich has visions of making Zlobenia &quot;the Ankh-Morpork of the mountains&quot;, much to the amusement of Samuel Vimes. Heinrich is also heir to the Borogravian throne after the death of the Duchess Annagovia. In &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; he declares war against Borogravia to assert his claim.

====Chalk====
The Chalk is an area of rolling chalk downland near Lancre, bearing a great resemblance to Pratchett&#x27;s native Wiltshire. The &quot;soft&quot; geology of the area is, according to some mountain witches, not conducive to the channelling of magic. In fact this is a misconception (the bones of the hills are flint), and powerful witches can and do reside there, although the local baron has outlawed witchcraft, meaning they do not identify themselves as such. This law has since been repealed or at least ignored by the new baron since Tiffany Aching began openly practising magic there.

====Llamedos====
Llamedos is a land noted for its druids, its bards, and its rain. Rain is the chief export of Llamedos; it has rain mines, in addition to ore and coal mines. Holly is the one plant that can grow in Llamedos&#x27;s climate; everything else just rots. Llamedos is run by druids, who dot the land with stone circles used for computation. This is a lifetime job, since they frequently need upgrading. Llamedos is a fairly obvious parody of the British constituent country Wales. Its annual bardic competition, the Eisteddfod, is still held in Wales. The name is a reference to Dylan Thomas&#x27;s radio play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, for which he created the fictitious Welsh town of Llareggub (&quot;bugger all&quot; spelled backwards); Llamedos, accordingly, is &quot;Sod &#x27;em all&quot; spelled backwards. The inhabitants tend to speak with a doubled-L accent, i.e. &quot;Llots of lluck!&quot; Its native son Imp Y Celyn changes the course of the Discworld&#x27;s musical history in &quot;Soul Music&quot;.

====Octarine Grass Country====
The Octarine Grass Country is an area of rich farmland which, thanks to its proximity to the Ramtops, also happens to be saturated with magic. So saturated, in fact, that it is possible to grow re-annual crops: crops that germinate and grow the spring before they are planted. This is the homeland of Mort. The Octarine Grass Country predominantly features in &quot;Reaper Man&quot;, where Death goes to work under the name Bill Door.

====Genua====

The most notable region beyond the Sto Plains is the small city of Genua, a Morporkian-speaking nation that bears some resemblance to New Orleans. Its most significant appearance in the books is in &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;. It is in an area called the Swamplands, some distance from the Sto Plains/Ramtops locations of most of the books.

The name Genua is probably based on Genoa, a city in Italy. However, Genua bears a striking resemblance to the French and Caribbean-influenced American South, especially New Orleans. Local transport is by cattle- or troll-powered paddleboats with onboard gambling. The local witch, Erzulie Gogol, is a Voodoo mambo complete with personal zombie (in her case, that of the former ruler of the principality, Baron Saturday, who himself shares a name with a famous Voodoo god) and the local food is essentially Cajun cuisine, including gumbo.

During the events of &quot;Witches Abroad&quot; the city was ruled by an evil fairy godmother, Lily Weatherwax, (sister of Lancre witch Esme Weatherwax) though she went by the name Lilith de Tempscire (a French calque of &quot;weather&quot;+&quot;wax&quot;). She was obsessed with fairy tales and thought she could force everyone to be happy if only she could get them to follow the logic of the &quot;happy ending.&quot; Under her rule, innkeepers who were not fat and jolly or inclined to tell jokes were sent to the dungeon, and Genua&#x27;s ruler, the Baron Saturday, was murdered so that his heir apparent, Ella, could be a neglected orphan, as the tales dictated. Soon, the city began to resemble a skewed version of Disneyland. The name &quot;Genua&quot; therefore could also be an ironic echo of &quot;genuine&quot;, which is exactly what Genua, at this time, was not. Eventually, thanks to the efforts of the Lancre Coven, Lily was deposed and sent to a dimension of endless mirrors, and Ella was able to assume her role as Baroness of Genua without marrying a frog as Lily had intended.

Genua was most likely established as a far flung colony of the Morporkian Empire, explaining why it shares more similarities with Ankh-Morpork/Sto Plains than its immediate neighbours Überwald and Muntab. The state first gained power under General Tacticus, who, having been sent there by the Morporkian Empire to stay out of the way, proceeded to declare war on Ankh-Morpork.

According to the novel &quot;Going Postal&quot;, Genua is located approximately from Ankh-Morpork by road, a journey of two months by stagecoach. A faster method is to travel by flying broomstick, whereby the city can be reached in a single day, though this may involve losing one&#x27;s ears or freezing to death.

===Klatch===
The continent of Klatch consists of that part of the Discworld&#x27;s super continent that is rimwards of the Circle Sea. Like the distinction between Europe and Asia, the difference between Klatch and the unnamed continent that Ankh-Morpork stands upon is arbitrary and cultural rather than geographically evident. The continent includes the Circle Sea states of Ephebe, Tsort, Djelibeybi, Omnia, and the more rimwards territories of Howondaland, Tezumen Empire, Betrek, Smale, Klatchistan, and Muntab. It can be thought of as roughly equivalent to Africa.

In the words of Terry Pratchett: &quot;Not loosely based on Africa at all. Honestly.&quot;

The continent&#x27;s principal nation, also called Klatch, is a large multi-ethnic empire rimwards to turnwise of the Circle Sea. It resembles medieval Arabic states, and has a political system similar to the Ottoman Empire. Its capital is Al Khali (popularly known as &#x27;the Gateway to the mysterious continent of Klatch&#x27;), and it includes outlying regions such as Hersheba and Syrrit. Klatch is a commercial rival of Ankh-Morpork – the book &quot;Jingo&quot; depicts a brief war between the two mainly on economic land ownership grounds. It is also a common metaphorical boundary for anything considered genuinely &quot;foreign&quot;, despite other areas of similar distance not being considered as such. There is some cultural mistrust between the Sto Plains and Klatch, as evidenced by the phrase &quot;Pardon my Klatchian&quot; upon speaking a rude word.

Despite the tendency of Morporkians to see Klatchians as savages, &quot;Jingo&quot; makes clear that Klatchians are technologically and scientifically advanced. It is said that the Klatchians had 15 distinct words for assassination before the rest of the world had caught on to the idea of hitting each other with rocks. This situation parallels that which existed between Europe and the Arab world throughout the Middle Ages. The ruler of Klatch is called the Seriph (perhaps a play on &quot;caliph&quot;, &quot;sherif/sharif&quot;, &quot;seraph&quot; and &quot;serif&quot;). In &quot;Sourcery&quot;, the Seriph was Creosote, a rather vain and foolish man who was obsessed with poetry. A genie reportedly granted a great fortune to his grandfather, which was more or less squandered by modern times. It is unknown whether Creosote is still Seriph; the Prince Cadram and Prince Khufurah appeared in &quot;Jingo&quot;, but it is unknown whether they are relatives of Creosote. The &quot;Klatchian Foreign Legion&quot; parodies French military activities in North Africa. The name is probably a play on &quot;&quot;; a recognition of its most famous export, Klatchian coffee. The principal deity of Klatch is Offler, a crocodile-headed god.

Al Khali has been described by Rincewind as &quot;like Ankh, only with sand instead of mud&quot;. It is bisected by the Tsort River. The city is noted for its wind, which blows from the vast deserts of Klatch, and has been described as &quot;a gentle but persistent breeze&quot;. Notable features of the city include

* The Rhoxie: The Seriph of al Khali&#x27;s resplendent palace, in the centre of the city. Surrounded by an artificial paradise, it contains the Seriph&#x27;s harem and courtiers. However, it was heavily damaged during the events of &quot;Sourcery&quot;, and it is unknown whether it was repaired. However it was mentioned in &quot;Pyramids&quot; as being &quot;down the coast&quot;.
* The &quot;soak&quot; (a play on &quot;souk&quot;): A bazaar highly spoken of by Cohen the Barbarian. A series of alleys, frequented by the criminal underclass.
* The Temple Frescoes: Famous frescoes of people involved in sexual acts. Tours leave hourly from the Square of 967 Delights (Khalians are meticulous about things that interest them).

Klatchian coffee is a strong, nearly magical coffee, brewed in Klatch and drunk only by the initiated in very small cups. Presumably an exaggerated version of Turkish coffee, Klatchian coffee has a strong sobering effect, bringing the drinker &quot;to the other side of sobriety&quot;. This state of sobriety is referred to as knurd (&quot;drunk&quot; spelled backwards; compare the entry in the &quot;Jargon File&quot;). To be &quot;knurdish&quot; is described as the opposite of being drunk: Not sobriety – the mere absence of drunkenness – but just as far away from sobriety in the opposite direction, resulting in an appalling existential clarity. According to &quot;Sourcery&quot;, being knurd strips away all the comforting illusions in which people usually spend their lives, letting them see and think clearly for the first time. This is a very traumatic experience, although it is noted that it sometimes leads to important discoveries. To counteract the effects of Klatchian coffee, in Klatch it is drunk with Orakh (a very violent alcoholic beverage made by mixing scorpion venom and cactus sap and fermenting it in the sun for several weeks), possibly referring to Italian &quot;espresso&quot; coffee which is often drunk with &quot;grappa&quot;, a very strong, often homemade, alcohol (although the name &quot;Orakh&quot; is presumably a reference to arak). After a few screams, a lie down and a stiff drink, the occasional drinker will try never to be &quot;knurd&quot; again.

Although knurdness is a state usually only obtainable by drinking Klatchian coffee, Samuel Vimes, one of the Discworld&#x27;s most notable characters, is described in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; as being naturally two drinks short of actual sobriety. This makes him slightly knurd by default, which partially accounts for his depressive nature and tendency towards alcoholism—he started out looking for a cure to knurdness. Once he starts drinking, however, he cannot stop and always gets the dosage wrong.

====Ephebe====
Ephebe is largely the Discworld analogue of Athenian Greece. However, it also takes influences from Alexandria and Minos; the name is an Anglicisation of the Greek concept of ephebos. Ephebe lies on the hubwards shores of the Circle Sea on the Klatchian continent, widdershins of the Klatchian Empire, Tsort and Djelibeybi and turnwise of Omnia.

Ephebe has only been visited twice in the novels, in &quot;Pyramids&quot; and &quot;Small Gods&quot;. However, we know from &quot;Eric&quot; that in its early history, it fought a series of damaging wars against Tsort, with which it remains in a cold-war situation to this day. The disappearance of the Djel River valley in &quot;Pyramids&quot; briefly sparked a resumption of hostilities, which mostly involved highly reluctant soldiers hiding in wooden horses, waiting for the other side to take them into the city. This was quickly ended by the Djel&#x27;s abrupt reappearance. In &quot;Small Gods&quot;, it was briefly invaded by Omnia; however, this occupation quickly collapsed and Ephebe launched a decisive counter-strike in alliance with the other nations along the Klatchian coast.

The country was heavily affected by the first temporal shattering mentioned in &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, as a result of which the philosophers living there appear extraordinarily long-lived. Ephebe has a population of about 50,000, according to &quot;The Discworld Companion&quot;. Much of this population is made up of slaves, who have steadfastly refused any efforts to give them more rights; they are quite happy with their guaranteed income and safety as slaves (and the possibility of owning slaves of their own).

As a democracy, Ephebe is unusual on the Discworld. Those citizens who are not disqualified on account of being foreigners, mad, poor or female elect a Tyrant to run the city, who invariably turns out to be a criminal madman. They then elect another Tyrant, who is much the same. At the time of &quot;Small Gods&quot; (the position of which in the Discworld chronology is somewhat obscure), Ephebe was ruled by a small, fat man with skinny legs, who resembled an egg hatching upside-down. It is unknown whether he is still ruler.

According to &quot;The Discworld Companion&quot;, it does not have an economy. The people are perfectly happy living off the fish and olives farmed by the slaves, or the way Teppic described it in &quot;Pyramids&quot;, they made wine of everything they could stuff in a bucket and ate whatever couldn&#x27;t crawl out of one, which gives time for Ephebe&#x27;s major export: philosophy. For what it&#x27;s worth (about one Ankh-Morpork penny), the currency of Ephebe is the talent. Ephebe is a city of philosophers; some hardware merchants have taken to stocking towels, in case of clothing-challenged brilliant thinkers (an allusion to Archimedes&#x27; &quot;Eureka!&quot;). The philosophers are noted for pondering the existence of gods, but carefully in case the gods get angry. Brawls between varying philosophical factions frequently erupt across Ephebe&#x27;s many taverns, but Ephebe is on the whole a peaceful city, which &quot;ambles by from day to day&quot; (&quot;The New Discworld Companion&quot;). One of the philosophers Teppic met in Ephebe was instrumental in the building of a lighthouse. The proposed location for the lighthouse was deemed to be disruptive to the view of the harbour and so it was placed some distance inland. Sailors who find themselves stranded on the rocks of the harbour have considered the lighthouse a quite beautiful thing to look at whilst waiting to be rescued.

====Djelibeybi====
Djelibeybi is based on the cultures of Ancient Egypt. Also called the Kingdom of the Sun and the Old Kingdom. Principal crops: melons, garlic and, since they are increasingly encroaching on the fertile agricultural land, pyramids. The name &quot;Djelibeybi&quot; is a pun lost on most people outside the UK, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, playing on &quot;Jelly baby&quot;, a popular gummi sweet in those countries. The joke is compounded when Pratchett says that &quot;Djelibeybi&quot; means &quot;Child of the Djel&quot; (its main river; the line is a parody of Herodotus&#x27;s famous claim that Egypt was the &quot;gift of the Nile&quot;). Djelibeybi is wide and long and is on the Circle Sea coast of Klatch. The ancient country of Ur lies Rimward of it. The kingdom is almost entirely underwater during the flood season, and both threatened and protected on either side by stronger neighbours (Tsort and Ephebe). It was once great, but all that now remains is an expensive palace, a few ruins and pyramids. The entire economic life of the country is, until after the events of &quot;Pyramids&quot;, devoted to building them. As a result, Djelibeybi is permanently bankrupt. The country has an enormous number of local gods, unknown to the world outside. Its ruler, the Pharaoh, is also a god, although in human form. He wears a gold mask (the Face of the Sun) and during his official functions carries the Flail of Mercy, the obsidian Reaping Hook of Justice, the Honeycomb of Increase, the Asp of Wisdom, the Sheaf of Plenty, the Gourd of the Water of the Heavens, the Three-Pronged Spear of the Waters of the Earth, the Cabbage of the Vegetative Increase and the Scapula of Hygiene. However, the then Pharaoh Pteppicymon XXVIII, also known as Pteppic, discovered that the mask was in fact gilded lead, the original gold one having likely been sold to pay for the pyramids.

====Tsort====
Tsort: A mythical place (no books have yet been set there, with the possible exception of the events portrayed in &quot;Faust Eric&quot; where Rincewind and Eric Thursley appear briefly), the Disc&#x27;s analogue to ancient Troy. Its enmity with Ephebe began with the famous Tsortean War, when King Mausoleum of Tsort kidnapped Queen Eleneor of Ephebe, leading to a siege that lasted for decades. To this day Tsort and Ephebe believe there is a place for giant wooden horses in combat. Tsort possesses a Great Pyramid, although pyramid-building has long been out of fashion and – no doubt because of the example of nearby Djelibeybi – modern Tsorteans scorn the things. Tradition claims Tsort was razed by the armies of Ephebe under Lavaeolus, and that it was home to the famed Tsortean Knot until the Knot was undone – sliced in half – by Carelinus. The people of Tsort worship all manner of gods, some of which seem to comprise all the bits the other gods had left over. The river Tsort bisects the desert rimwards of Al Khali.

====Omnia====
Omnia is a desert theocracy ruled by the Cenobiarch, the head of the Omnian Church, from the Citadel in the capital city of Kom (a sort of cross between Qum, Jerusalem and the Vatican). There is also a connection to the Latin word &#x27;Omnis&#x27;, meaning all or everything, ironic due to the nation&#x27;s unipolar outlook. When Omnianism was an intolerant religion it was known for its imperialism, having conquered the neighbouring countries of Betrek, Istanzia and Ushistan in the name of the Great God Om. After Brutha became the Cenobiarch, the country reversed directions and became the home of a renowned theological college and library. These days it is known for the constant arguing amongst the clergy, as new interpretations of Brutha&#x27;s teachings spring up every day. The currency of Omnia is the obol. In &quot;The Truth&quot;, it was mentioned that Omnia (or possibly the Agatean Empire) developed movable type printing in the production of religious texts.

====Deepest Klatch====
Howondaland is the Discworld&#x27;s principal &quot;jungle&quot; region. It lies on the Klatchian continent, and is the Disc&#x27;s rough analogue to Sub-Saharan Africa, although the Tezumen Empire gives it Mesoamerican overtones as well. Howondaland is not so much a country as a blank patch on the map. Just as &quot;darkest Africa&quot; remained largely unexplored by Europeans until the 19th century, &quot;darkest Klatch&quot; is largely unknown to most Discworlders. Exploration of the land has been hampered by the habit of explorers ending up nailed to trees. Its name is probably a play on Gondwanaland or perhaps a play on the expression &quot;How on earth ...?&quot; transformed into &quot;How on the land... ?&quot; There is also an echo of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland&quot; in the name. In some of the early Discworld novels (American publications) it is spelled &quot;Howonderland.&quot; In &quot;Snuff&quot;, it was discovered that inexpensive tobacco for consumption in Ankh-Morpork was produced on Howondaland plantations, using slave labour by goblins transported from the Shires.

The Great Nef is a vast desert on the Klatchian continent, noted mainly for containing the Dehydrated Ocean, an ocean consisting of dehydrated water. Dehydrated water is a peculiar substance found only in areas of high magical concentration. It resembles fine sand, but can be reconstituted into normal water by adding water. The Dehydrated Ocean is home to its own, unique, kinds of fish. The name &quot;Nef&quot; is a reversal of fen, a type of wetland; &quot;Great Nef&quot; in particular may be a reference to the Great Fen, an historical wetland area in England in the area now known as The Fens and the subject of a restoration effort known as the Great Fen Project.

Only briefly mentioned in the books, Hersheba is a small desert kingdom rimwards of Klatchian empire, practically on the more-or-less vague boundary of Howondaland. The country is said to be ruled by a queen who lives forever (probably a reference to H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;She&quot;). The nomadic tribes known as the D&#x27;regs occupy areas of Hersheba as well as Klatch. Depredations against Klatch by Hersheban D&#x27;regs, against Hersheba by Klatchian D&#x27;regs, and against both sides by their own D&#x27;regs has led to the border being in a permanent state of war. The name is a play on Hershey bar and also resembles Israeli Beersheba; Pratchett initially suggested it as an alternative name for Djelibeybi, to aid American readers mystified by the pun.

Very little is known about the Theocracy of Muntab. Its ruler is known as a Pash (Lu-Tze, the History Monk, once had to make sure one of them choked on a fishbone). It is often used as a generic third-world country, as in &quot;Eat your dinner, there are starving children in Muntab who&#x27;d be glad to have that!&quot; It is more or less on the border between the continent of Klatch and the Unnamed Continent, and is located more or less rimwards of Borogravia. Muntab is known to be eager to emerge as a dominant nation in the modern world, and is suspected to have ambitions to conquer the hubward nations, most notably Borogravia. As a result, it figures into the famous political problem, the Muntab Question – most often quoted as &quot;Where&#x27;s Muntab?&quot;, but in serious political discussion is more likely to concern the sides on which the more developed nations would fall in a war between Muntab and Borogravia. Muntab is very likely one of the nations in the Alliance that Borogravia is fighting in the novel &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;. Muntab&#x27;s calendar &quot;counts down&quot;; no-one really knows why, but it&#x27;s probably NOT a good idea to stay there to see for oneself what happens when the count reaches zero.

Nothing is known of Istanzia, although it is a state big enough to send an Ambassador to Ankh-Morpork for Commander Vimes to frighten: when in &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; the Istanzian forces were reported to be making repeated armed incursions across the Slipnir River, Vimes&#x27;s offer to arrange for the Istanzian Ambassador to &quot;...go home in an ambulance&quot; resulted in the Istanzian forces pulling back so far that they were &quot;...nearly in the next country.&quot; At some point, Istanzia was controlled by Omnia (&quot;Small Gods&quot;), but it can be assumed they have gained personal jurisdiction.

The Tezumen Empire is a jungle civilisation in the darkest depths of Howondaland that resembles the Aztecs. They are renowned as the most pessimistic and angst-ridden culture on the Disc; their writing is engraved on giant slabs of stone rather than more conveniently written on paper. Large discs of precisely-carved stone with holes in the middle are used for almost every imaginable purpose except making wheels, a technology which they have not yet discovered. Before the events in &quot;Eric&quot;, they worshiped the &quot;feathered boa&quot; Quezovercoatl, a parody of the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl, who was a junior demon who supplanted the previous Tezumen god, a stick; after manifesting himself to his worshippers, he was revealed to be only six inches high. The Tezumens have since tired of gods and killed all their priests.

===Counterweight Continent===
The Counterweight Continent is situated on the opposite edge of the Discworld from the Unnamed Continent and Klatch. It is smaller than these other two landmasses but acts as a counterweight because its crust is made up largely of gold and octiron, both dense, heavy metals. It is (roughly) comma-esque in shape, and the tip of the comma extends all the way up to the ice cap at the Hub. Its closest point to the Unnamed Continent is about away but, as the channel is under an ice cap, it is often referred to as an isthmus. The cultures of the Counterweight Continent are a play upon those of Earth&#x27;s Far East, or at least Western perceptions of it. In a pun on the Orient, it is also known as the Aurient, from the Latatian (Latin) word &#x27;aurum&#x27; (gold), meaning &#x27;the place where gold comes from&#x27;.

The Agatean Empire is the home of Twoflower and the Luggage. The country was first mentioned in the very first Discworld novel &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, but was not explored: its main role was as the place from which Twoflower had come. It appeared in a brief segment of &quot;Mort&quot;, and was the setting for most of &quot;Interesting Times&quot;.

The Agatean Empire is similar to feudal Japan or Imperial China, most obviously in the vast wall that surrounds it, and the belief that anyone from outside the Empire must be an invisible vampire ghost (probably a play on &quot;gwailo&quot;, lit. ghost man). The name is a pun on the term &quot;Jade Empire,&quot; referring to ancient China. The capital of the Empire is Hunghung and the biggest port (and only one mentioned) is Bes Pelargic. However, in &quot;Mort&quot;, Bes Pelargic was depicted as the Agatean capital, as Mort travelled there for the death of the Grand Vizier Nine Turning Mirrors.

The crust of the Agatean Empire is composed largely of gold, octiron and other heavy metals. Exchange rates between the Ankh-Morpork dollar and the Empire&#x27;s currency, the rhinu, has never been established because the solid gold coins are worth significantly less on the Counterweight Continent than on the Sto Plains. Because of the readily-availability of gold, the Counterweight Continent is comparable to the Roundworld&#x27;s African Mali Empire. Gold is such a ubiquitous metal in the Agatean Empire that it has taken on the role of lead as a material for roofing and plumbing; gold is only used for small denominations of the rhinu, whilst larger denominations such as ten rhinu are issued in the form of paper notes.

Large amounts of octiron make Agatean Empire home of the rare sapient pear trees. The wood of this tree is used to build luggages.

The Empire was founded thousands of years ago by the Emperor One Sun Mirror. Until fairly recently, it was ruled by a number of constantly fighting and somewhat psychotic noble families (the Hongs, the Sungs, the Fangs, the Tangs and the McSweeneys), all jockeying to be emperor. They viewed politics as similar to chess; the goal was to put one&#x27;s opponent in an untenable position, and the best way to do that was to take as many opposing pieces as possible through the sacrifice of pawns.

As in feudal Japan (and later imperial Japan), the Emperor was seen as a god, and could do anything he liked. Given how nastily inventive a noble had to be to get to this point, this was not a good thing. In &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;Mort&quot;, the Emperor was an idealistic young boy; however, by &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, he had been supplanted by an elderly man who was quite insane (and who is said to have killed his nephew for the throne). During &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, Cohen the Barbarian was declared Emperor, and started changing the system into one a no-nonsense barbarian could feel comfortable with. It was felt by many of the peasantry that he was the &quot;preincarnation&quot; of One Sun Mirror, because Agateans believe in a form of backward reincarnation in which the soul&#x27;s next life takes place chronologically earlier than its previous life. Since the events of &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, it can be presumed Cohen is no longer Emperor. Details of his replacement are unknown, although it is implied that most of the duties of governance had already been assumed by his Grand Vizier Twoflower by the time of his intended-to-be death. In the companion book &quot;The Compleat Discworld Atlas&quot;, the Empire has been supplanted by the People&#x27;s Beneficient Republic of Agatea, led by the Chairman of the Central Committee of the People&#x27;s Revolution Madame Butterfly (possibly Twoflower&#x27;s daughter and the former leader of the revolutionary Red Army).

Bhangbhangduc is a subject island of the Agatean Empire.

The island fulfills the role of Borneo, in that it is large, covered in jungle, and home to the orangutan. It is also the site of the death of explorer Sir Roderick Purdeigh, after he yelled at a &quot;native&quot; and jabbed him with his walking stick in an attempt to make him stand up straight and say something other than &quot;ook&quot;. Bhangbhangduc&#x27;s unusual flora includes the sledgehammer plant, one of the Disc&#x27;s carnivorous plants.

It appears unusual in the economics of the disc in that Bhangbhangduc uses the Silver Standard to base its money. This is unpopular in other areas who use gold (which does not tarnish).

Bhangbhangduc has its own distinct ethnic cuisine, encountered via Feeney Upshot&#x27;s grandparents in &quot;Snuff&quot;. Examples include:

* &quot;Bang Suck Duck&quot; (swede and chips optional)
* &quot;Man Dog Suck Po&quot; (with mashed carrots, but only as a Sunday special)

===Fourecks===

EcksEcksEcksEcks or Fourecks (previously known as XXXX or Terror Incognita) is clearly influenced by Australian culture, as seen in &quot;The Last Continent&quot;. Like Australia, Fourecks is both a country and a continent. It consists largely of desert land, which for some time remained unfinished. It was created some time after the rest of the Discworld by the old man who carries the universe in a sack. Lu-Tze and other sources state that on Fourecks time and space are very twisted up, and there is a big time source right in the middle (probably the Red Rock, the Ecksian version of Uluru). The continent&#x27;s name is a play on Castlemaine XXXX, a Queensland lager, and advertised there with adverts playing on Australian stereotypes. According to the books, maps used the label &quot;XXXX&quot; because no-one knew what the place was called.

Both the flora and fauna of the continent are extremely dangerous, as Death&#x27;s Library attests. A book series known as &quot;Dangerous Mammals, Reptiles, Amphibians, Birds, Fish, Jellyfish, Insects, Spiders, Crustaceans, Grasses, Trees, Mosses and Lichens of Terror Incognita&quot; extends at least into &quot;Volume 29c Part Three&quot;, while a list of the harmless ones contains only &quot;Some of the sheep.&quot; There are few poisonous snakes in XXXX, the explanation being that &quot;most of them have been eaten by the spiders&quot;.

For much of its history, the entire continent was surrounded with a huge anticyclone which effectively prevented rainclouds from arriving or ships from leaving. This was due to interference by the wizards of Unseen University while fleeing the bug-obsessed god of evolution during the creation of Fourecks. Shortly before the permanent drought reached catastrophic proportions the anticyclone was dissipated by Rincewind, although, as usual, he received no credit. Many Ecksians have since taken the opportunity to explore the Disc. According to Lu Tze, the relief barman everywhere now comes from Fourecks.

The indigenous population are very similar to Indigenous Australians, with a strong mythology. Until recently, their main peculiarity was a tendency to attack anyone who talked about the weather. There is also a population of Ankh-Morporkian settlers, from various shipwrecks.

The capital of Fourecks is evidently Bugarup. Other known settlements are Dijabringabeeralong, Cangoolie (a parody of Kalgoorlie) and Worralorrasurfa. Time and space appear more consistent in these areas. An odd quirk of the Fourecksian government is that they immediately put their politicians in jail as soon as they are elected. According to the locals, &quot;It saves time.&quot; Another important feature of the city is the Old Brewery, where Roo Beer lager is made. It has a huge billboard featuring a grinning kangaroo. The New Brewery is abandoned, because it was built on an &quot;unsacred site&quot; which made the beer flat- a reference to the Old Swan Brewery of Perth, Western Australia. There is also a local magic college for wizards. The university&#x27;s motto is &quot;Nullus Anxietas (no worries).&quot; The university is similar in some ways to Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork, although rather than an Tower of Art they have one that is tall at the bottom, but a tall at the top. The Archchancellor is named Bill Rincewind, possibly a relation of Rincewind, Unseen University&#x27;s Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography and trained coward.

Bugarup has a regular festival in which female impersonators play a notable part, very similar to the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. It is called the Galah, possibly after a local bird and also a play on &quot;gala&quot;; galah is also Australian slang for someone who is a bit of a fool.

Just off the coast of Fourecks are several islands: the Land of Fog or the Foggy Islands, home of the morporks (a reference to the English translation of New Zealand&#x27;s Māori name &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, the Land of the Long White Cloud); and Purdeigh&#x27;s Island (or Purdeighsland), discovered by the explorer Sir Roderick Purdeigh, who somehow missed the continent itself (in much the same way the Dutch sailor Abel Tasman managed to do with Australia, but did get to have an island named after him).

===Krull===
The most notable nation to lie on the Rim (it actually juts slightly over it) is the island kingdom of Krull. The nation&#x27;s capital is also called Krull (featured in &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;), and a local river is known as the Hakrull River (mentioned in &quot;Mort&quot;).

Its economy is largely based on the capture and salvage of nautical wreckage as it heads towards the Rimfall. To aid in this, the Krullians constructed the Disc&#x27;s largest manmade object: the Circumfence, a great net that extends across a third of the Disc&#x27;s perimeter. Now in disrepair, it is still maintained by the occasional guardian, such as Tethis the sea troll.

Due to its unique position, Krull is one of the Disc&#x27;s main centres of astronomical and astrological learning; indeed until recently, its high priest was also its chief astronomer. Krull possesses a magical University and, unlike the Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork, the Krullians have no problem educating female wizards.

Krullians are noted for their habitual nervousness and fatalism, the product of spending their lives overlooking a bottomless black abyss of infinity. On the Disc, the phrase &quot;being on edge&quot; is a reference to the Krullians.

In &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, it has been shown that life does exist over the Rim of the Discworld, whether that be rimfishers (kingfisher specially adapted to living over the rim) or entire islands populated by the survivors of shipwrecks and their possible descendants.

==Lifeforms==
Pratchett created or adapted a variety of fictional lifeforms for the Discworld setting, both sentient and non-sentient.

=== Sapient species ===
Pratchett populated the Discworld with his own interpretations of numerous classic fantasy and mythological races as well as humans. While humans are portrayed as the main inhabitants of the major Discworld cities, many other races have left their traditional domain and integrated with other, sometimes hostile, species in Discworld&#x27;s cities. Though Discworld races are often inspired by other authors&#x27; versions or by real-world mythologies, they may have different characteristics than their prototypes. For example, on Discworld trolls are made of stone rather than being turned to stone by sunlight like Tolkien&#x27;s trolls; Discworld Furies have physical similarities to the Furies of Greco-Roman myth, but have different roles. In the list below, Discworld races are followed by the real-world inspiration for them.
; Demons: Closely resemble gods and number in the millions. They live in Pandemonium, a city in a spacious dimension on the same space-time continuum as the Disc. Demons are hierarchical, murderously competitive, and staunch traditionalists. Able to peer across multiple dimensions and yet unimaginative, their depiction borrows heavily from Earth lore about demons, including The Book of Revelation, The Divine Comedy, and Paradise Lost. Most choose to seem as disgusting as possible. Demons can be summoned to do a human&#x27;s bidding. They enjoy being treated ceremoniously and shown respect. Some low-grade demons stay on Discworld permanently, operating devices such as pocket-watches and picture-making devices.
;Dragons: 
:; &quot;Draco nobilis&quot; (AKA Noble/Great Dragon): Huge fierce beasts similar to legends from Earth. They had been thought extinct on the Disc until one attacked the city of Ankh-Morpork; some postulated that they migrated to somewhere with lower gravity. A subspecies of &quot;Draco nobilis&quot; known as &quot;Draco lunaris&quot;, was found on the Discworld&#x27;s moon, composed of herbivorous silver dragons of varying sizes. (Other definitions)
:; &quot;Draco vulgaris&quot; (AKA Common Swamp Dragon): Originating from the swamps of Genua, swamp dragons are small excitable creatures thought to descend from &quot;Draco nobilis&quot;, adapted for a heavy air environment. They are prone to various illnesses and known to fatally explode when stressed. No specimens are known to exist in the wild but they have been bred in captivity as pets for generations, although they can be difficult to take care of.
:; &quot;Draco maritimus immensus&quot;: Inspired by the Earth legends of the Midgard Serpent, the serpent is huge and wraps around the rim of the world biting its own tail. It has not been observed on the Discworld, but has been observed from there on other disc-shaped worlds.
;Dwarfs: Short, stocky, bearded metal-workers, generally seen wearing leather and chain mail and brandishing axes. Historically they were usually miners and smiths but were also known for being excellent engineers, jewelers, and printers. Male and female dwarfs historically dress the same. Both wear long beards and use masculine names and pronouns. This began to change as some Dwarfs, such as Cheery Littlebottom became more comfortable openly being known as female and dressing in feminine attire. They have parallels with dwarfs from Nordic and Germanic mythology and are similar to the dwarves of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth.
: The legal aspects of Dwarfish Culture are known as &quot;kruk&quot;, which translates as &quot;mining law&quot; but also covers laws regarding ownership, marriage, and handling disputes. The Low King, whose authority extends over all dwarfish communities, is the final arbiter in cases where the kruk is unclear. Dwarfs consider their culture more important than genetics, and can consider other species to be Dwarfs, such as in the case of Carrot Ironfoundersson. Dwarfs believe the universe to have been created by Tak, a figure who wrote into being, in order, himself, the Laws, the world, a cave, and a geode; the first Human and Dwarf hatched from the Geode and Tak fashioned the first Troll from what remained when he saw it was trying to come alive. When a Dwarf dies, their tools are melted down and they are buried with a weapon of the finest quality for their journey after death.
;Elves: While choosing to appear tall and beautiful to humans, their real appearance is thin and grey with triangular faces and pointy eyes. They navigate and track other creatures through magnetic fields, and as such are heavily pained by iron. They have the ability to manipulate people&#x27;s minds. The Elves are based on the nastier kind of fairy-folk in European (and other) folklore in addition to aliens in modern pop culture.
: Elves come from a parasitic world, referred to as &quot;Elfland&quot; or &quot;Fairyland&quot; ruled by their Queen; it latches onto other worlds to steal from and sometimes enslave the population. The world is currently cold, filled with snow, does not feel like a real place, and nothing grows older there; time passes at a slower pace compared to the Disc the deeper inside it you travel. The world is constantly changing as it contains peoples&#x27; dreams and nightmares. (Other definitions) 
;Gnolls: Members of this race carry everything they own on their backs, some supplemented by carts. Their appearance and smell repels most other races, but their extreme collection habits are credited with keeping the streets of Ankh-Morpork clean (for a limited value of &#x27;clean&#x27;). (Other definitions)
;Gnomes: Ranging in size from to , they are, Pratchett says, more or less interchangeable with the Nac Mac Feegles. (English folkloric definition)
;Goblins: Small humanoids who inhabit dank caves. Most other races considered them less than animals and they were often enslaved or exterminated until the events of &quot;Snuff&quot;, after which they were granted full sentient rights. Goblin spirituality revolves around &quot;unggue&quot;, the collection of bodily secretions such as earwax in magical pots. (Other definitions)
;Gods : Discworld theologians believe there are 3,000 major gods and rising. Gods are called into being by the belief of sentient lifeforms, and their status and power derives from the number and devotion of their believers. Those without followers or very few are known as &quot;small gods&quot;. The major gods are in a loose-knit pantheon seated at Cori Celisti, a huge mountain at the Hub of the Disc, in a palace known as &quot;Dunmanifestin&quot;. The gods play games with people&#x27;s souls on a board that is a carving of the disc. Two gods, Fate and Luck (AKA The Lady) are immune to change as there is hardly anybody in the multiverse who doesn&#x27;t believe in them.
:; Things from the Dungeon Dimensions (AKA Dark Gods): These exist in the Dungeon Dimensions, a place outside the multiverse devoid of space and time. They attempt to enter in places where the walls of reality are thin and hate living things intensely. Some wizards have said the Things were once Dark Gods that were driven out of the world.
; Golems: Golems are humanoid beings made of clay approximately 7 to 8 feet tall and fiery triangle eyes. They do not feel hunger, the need to sleep, pain, or boredom, and can survive in extreme temperatures and conditions. They can repair themselves and last for centuries with the oldest specimens being approximately 60,000 years old. Their heads are hollow and contain scrolls or (in the case of the older golems) clay tablets, which contains their directives (to work, not to kill, and to be humble). Their scrolls/tablets are also known as their &#x27;chem&#x27;. Golems were highly sought after as employees, working without rest apart from occasional holy days where they leave their posts for a few hours. They were traditionally barred from speaking and could only communicate through writing until the events of &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; in which Commander Sam Vimes changed their specifications. In the novel, they also began to buy back their freedom and attained independence of thought, deciding what they want their own inner words to be. Discworld&#x27;s Golems draw inspiration from the Jewish folkloric definition.

;Igors: Igors are a humanoid family in Überwald, all of whom are named Igor or Igorina. Igors are known to lurch, shamble, and speak with a lisp. Many have served aristocratic vampires and mad scientists. Igors are skilled in surgery, particularly wound repair and transplants, including of entire limbs. They practice on themselves and leave their body parts to their family when they die to be transplanted. Igors are known to appear patchwork and covered in scars; they may have mismatched eyes, extra thumbs, and other individual alterations. Igorinas use their skill to appear beautiful but leave a detail such as a small scar or decorative stitching on themselves to maintain the family resemblance. They draw inspiration from Igor from the film &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.
;Orcs: A near extinct race who were bred/made from men (as goblins, according to Lord Vetinari, were not vicious enough) to be weapons in a great war. So far only one living orc (by name &quot;Mr Nutt&quot;) is known to exist although it is suspected that others exist in the wilds of far Überwald. Mr Nutt initially had to hide his species, even from himself, due to the brutal reputation and legends about orcs. Orcs themselves are shown to be not necessarily &#x27;bad&#x27; creatures; given the opportunity they can easily educate themselves, gain wisdom and a great sense of honesty and morality. However, many were forced into battle by men and knew only lives of cruelty thus giving rise to their fearsome reputation. They possess exceptional levels of strength, as well as a special organ hidden deep inside their body that is designed to heal the orc, even capable of bringing them back from some types of death. Featured in &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;. (Other definitions)
;Trolls : Trolls on the Discworld are large lifeforms best described as living rock, composed of silicon with carbon; they survive on minerals and are named after geology. Trolls are not known to die natural deaths: while they can be killed, as they grow several centuries old they head to the mountains, sit down, think deep thoughts, and eventually merge into the landscape. A Troll&#x27;s intelligence is dependent on the current temperature, at colder temperatures they can be smart as Einstein but as it gets warmer their brains overheat. Discworld Trolls draw inspiration from Scandinavian folklore. (Other definitions)
:;Gargoyles: Gargoyles are a subspecies of Troll that evolved for urban environments; unlike most Trolls, Gargoyles are carnivorous and eat pigeons. They tend to squat on rooftops and are reluctant to move. They enjoy absorbing rainwater from gutters and directing it through their jaws at pedestrians below. Their speech is guttural as their mouths are permanently fixed open. They are often used by the Ankh-Morpork City Watch for surveillance. (Architectural definition)
;Undead : Species in the Discworld novels categorised as undead include: Banshees (Celtic folkloric definition), Bogeymen (Other definitions), Ghouls (Other definitions), Ghosts (Other definitions), Mummies (Other definitions), Vampires (Other definitions), Werewolves (Other definitions), and Zombies (Other definitions). In the case of zombies, they are (unlike the classic horror-fiction depiction) fully sentient; for many of them, &#x27;dying at their desk&#x27; merely presented a minor inconvenience and a chance to request bereavement leave on behalf of their families. (Other definitions)

;Greco-Roman mythological creatures
: Centaurs: Believed to be the result of magical mutation. (Greco-Roman mythological definition)
: Fauns: Believed to be the result of magical mutation. (Greco-Roman mythological definition)
: Furies: Furies are birdlike creatures from Ephebe who can be trained to target a single individual, forcing people away from him/her. In that sense they act like guard dogs, whether their &quot;master&quot; likes it or not. They appear to be barely sentient. Featured in &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;. (Greco-Roman mythological definition)
: Gorgons: It is mentioned that a Gorgon had joined the Ankh-Morpork City Watch and accidentally turned 3 people to stone. Referenced in &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;. (Greek mythological definition)

===Other life forms===
Pratchett also created a variety of other fictional life forms on the Discworld. Like the sentient species, these also have real-world connections, although most of these connections take the form of slight changes to existing real-world animals, as shown in the .303 bookworm, which is a worm that evolved differently due to the danger of consuming magic books, or the hermit elephant, which is an elephant who has evolved hermit crab-like living conditions.

==Calendar==
The Discworld&#x27;s Unnamed Continent&#x27;s fictional calendar was first defined in a footnote in &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, and has been expanded upon in later novels and &quot;The Discworld Almanak&quot; (2004). It has numerous oddities, the chief of which is its length.

The calendar is based on a Great Year, or Astronomical Year, defined as the time it takes for the Disc to revolve once on the backs of the elephants. This lasts 800 days and contains two of each season (Midsummer occurs at a given point when the sun passes directly overhead, midwinter when it passes perpendicularly. However most people, especially farmers, consider four seasons to be a year, so an Agricultural Year of 400 days is used for most purposes.

The agricultural year is divided into 13 months:
*Ick (16 days) (the &quot;Dead Month&quot;)
*Offle (32 days)
*February (32 days)
*March (32 days)
*April (32 days)
*May (32 days)
*June (32 days)
*Grune (32 days)
*August (32 days)
*Spune (32 days)
*Sektober (32 days)
*Ember (32 days)
*December (32 days)

Each week has eight days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Octeday.

===Hogswatchnight===
The first of Ick is Hogswatchday, the Disc&#x27;s New Year, and the winter solstice from the perspective of Ankh-Morpork. In the Astronomical Year the second midwinter (the year&#x27;s midway point) is called Crueltide, but due to people using the Agricultural Year this is the same festival.

The 32nd of December, or the day before the New Year, is known as &quot;Hogswatchnight&quot;. Traditionally associated with pigs, to ensure the warmth and loving companionship of a pig for the rest of the cold, lonely winter. Many Hogswatch traditions are parodies of those associated with Christmas, including a decorated oak tree in a pot, strings of chicken sausage rolls, and, of course, a visit by the Hogfather. Witches do not leave the house on Hogswatchnight more because of tradition than any practical reasons. The witch Nanny Ogg gets around this by simply inviting everyone to &quot;her&quot; house for the holiday instead.

In the Omnian religion, Hogswatchnight is called the Fast of St Ossory. Omnians celebrate with fasting, prayer meetings, and the exchange of religious pamphlets.

Hogswatch was also a holiday celebrated in &quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot;, a non-Discworld book by Pratchett.

===The Glorious Twenty-Fifth of May===

The 25th of May is quietly celebrated by the survivors of the People&#x27;s Revolution, which ended the reign of Lord Winder. They wear a sprig of lilac and gather at the Small Gods Cemetery to honour the Watchmen who fell: Cecil Clapman, Ned Coates, Dai Dickins, John Keel, Horace Nancyball, Billy Wiglet, and (albeit temporarily) Reg Shoe.

In the Roundworld (following Terry Pratchett&#x27;s diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease), Match It For Pratchett called on fans to wear lilacs on 25 May in support of Terry. The date was chosen by Pratchett’s assistant, Rob Wilkins, when asked to find &quot;the one day in the year that would cause least offence”. He chose the 25th of May because it was Paul Weller’s birthday.

===Usage===
The calendar in general use in the Sto Plains and Ramtops (&quot;Ankh-Morpork years&quot;) uses the agricultural year, and counts from the founding of Unseen University. Years and centuries are also given names by the UU&#x27;s astrologers. 2005 AM, for instance, is the Year of the Prawn, the fifth year of the Century of the Anchovy. The majority of the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels are set in the 20th century AM, the Century of the Fruitbat, with the later ones entering the 21st, the Century of the Anchovy.

Other calendars count from various other events, and different schools of astronomy give the years different names. The Theocracy of Muntab has a calendar that counts &quot;down&quot;, rather than up. The reason for this is unknown, though it is agreed that waiting around for it to reach zero is unwise.

==Languages==
Pratchett gave the &quot;Discworld&quot; a variety of fictional languages, though most, if not all, of these are versions of real-world languages renamed to match country names created for the novels. Alongside those of the non-human species such as Dwarfs, Trolls, and orang-utans, the Disc&#x27;s fictional human languages include:
; Morporkian : The language of the Discworld locations of Ankh-Morpork, the Sto Plains, the Ramtops, Genua, and Fourecks (modified). Also, from characters&#x27; perspectives, the lingua franca of the Discworld (or, as referenced in &quot;Raising Steam&quot;, the &quot;lingua quirma&quot;). Comparable to real-world English.
; Latatian : A dead language of the majority of Morporkian-speaking countries; Pratchett did not state how widespread Latatian was in Discworld, but it was in use beyond simply Ankh-Morpork. Used, most often for humour, in novels in the mottoes of noble families, civic organisations, and Guilds of Ankh-Morpork, in legal principles, and by Discworld wizards, doctors, and scientists, the latter a satire of those professions&#x27; use of Latin to obfuscate language to laymen. Comparable to real-world Latin, though Pratchett describes it as &quot;very bad, doggy Latin&quot;. Examples: Motto of Ankh-Morpork City Watch: originally &quot;Fabricati Diem, Puncti Agunt Celeriter&quot;, meaning &quot;Make the day, the moments pass quickly&quot;; due to erosion, this later shortened to &quot;Fabricati Diem, Punc&quot;; that is, Make My Day, Punk. The legal principle &quot;Acquiris Quodcumque Rapis&quot; — &quot;you get what you grab&quot;.
; Quirmian : The language of the Discworld country of Quirm. Comparable to real-world French. Often used in elegant restaurants. Featured frequently in &quot;Raising Steam&quot;.
; Ephebian : The language of the Discworld country of Ephebe. Comparable to real-world Greek.
; Klatchian : The language(s) from the Discworld continent of Klatch — analogous for anywhere on the Earth from Africa, via South Asia, to South America. Also, the font is changed to a classical &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;-style when Klatchian is used in the novels. Comparable to real-world Arabic. Featured most prominently in &quot;Jingo&quot;.
; Agatean : The language of the Discworld Agatean Empire on the Counterweight Continent — analogous to the Far East. It is written in complicated pictograms. Minor differences in pronunciation alter word meanings completely. Pratchett sometimes used pictograms in the font of characters speaking Agatean. Comparable to real-world Chinese. Featured most prominently in &quot;Interesting Times&quot;.
; Uberwaldian : The language of the Discworld region of Überwald — analogous of Mittel European to Eastern European areas. The font is changed to German Gothic when Uberwaldean is used in novels. Comparable to real-world German and Slavic languages. Featured most prominently in &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;.

==&quot;The Folklore of Discworld&quot;==
&quot;The Folklore of Discworld&quot; is a book written by Terry Pratchett and Jacqueline Simpson as an ancillary to the &quot;Discworld&quot; series of novels. It details the folklore aspects of the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels and draws parallels with Earth&#x27;s folklore. It is divided into sections, each with an accompanying sketch by Paul Kidby.

As it was the only &quot;Discworld&quot; book published in 2008, 25 years after the appearance of the first Discworld book, &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, some of the hardback editions displayed a sticker stating &quot;25 Years of Discworld&quot;.

<doc id="1299849" wikidata="Q1673189" url="?curid=1299849" title="Irregular military">
<text>Irregular military is any military component distinct from a country&#x27;s regular armed forces, representing non-standard militant elements outside of conventional governmental backing. Irregular elements can consist of militias, private armies, mercenaries, or other non-state actors, though no single definition exists beyond exclusion from national service. Without standard military unit organization, various more general names are often used; such organizations may be called a &quot;troop&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, &quot;unit&quot;, &quot;column&quot;, &quot;band&quot;, or &quot;force&quot;. Irregulars are soldiers or warriors that are members of these organizations, or are members of special military units that employ irregular military tactics. This also applies to irregular infantry and irregular cavalry units.

Irregular warfare is warfare employing the tactics commonly used by irregular military organizations. This often overlaps with asymmetrical warfare, avoiding large-scale combat and focusing on small, stealthy, hit-and-run engagements.

== Regular vs. irregular ==

The words &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;irregular&quot; have been used to describe combat forces for hundreds of years, usually with little ambiguity. The requirements of a government&#x27;s chain of command cause the regular army to be very well defined, and anybody fighting outside it, other than official paramilitary forces, are irregular. In case the legitimacy of the army or its opponents is questioned, some legal definitions have been created.

In international humanitarian law, the term &quot;irregular forces&quot; refers to a category of combatants that consists of individuals forming part of the armed forces of a party to an armed conflict, international or domestic, but not belonging to that party&#x27;s regular forces and operating inside or outside of their own territory, even if the territory is under occupation.

The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 uses &quot;regular armed forces&quot; as a critical distinction. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a non-governmental organization primarily responsible for and most closely associated with the drafting and successful completion of the Third Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (&quot;GPW&quot;). The ICRC provided commentary saying that &quot;regular armed forces&quot; satisfy four Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907) (Hague IV) conditions. In other words, &quot;regular forces&quot; must satisfy the following criteria:

* being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates to a party of conflict
* having a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance
* carrying arms openly
* conducting operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war

By extension, combat forces that do not satisfy these criteria are termed &quot;irregular forces&quot;.

== Types ==
The term &quot;irregular military&quot; describes the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;what&quot;, but it is more common to focus on the &quot;why&quot; as just about all irregular units were created to provide a tactical advantage to an existing military, whether it was privateer forces harassing shipping lanes against assorted New World colonies on behalf of their European contractors, or Auxiliaries, levies, civilian and other standing irregular troops that are used as more expendable supplements to assist costly trained soldiers. Bypassing the legitimate military and taking up arms is an extreme measure. The motivation for doing so is often used as the basis of the primary label for any irregular military. Different terms come into and out of fashion, based on political and emotional associations that develop. Here is a list of such terms, which is organized more or less from oldest to latest:

* Auxiliaries – foreign or allied troops supplementing the regular army, organized from provincial or tribal regions. In the Imperial Roman army, it became common to maintain a number of auxiliaries about equal to the legionaries.
* Levies – feudal peasants and freemen liable to be called up for short-term military duty.
* Privateer – a &quot;for-profit&quot; private person or ship authorized and sponsored by a government by letters of marque to attack foreign vessels during wartime and to destroy or disrupt logistics of the enemy during &quot;peacetime&quot;, often on the open sea by attacking its merchant shipping, rather than engaging its combatants or enforcing a blockade against them.
* Revolutionary – someone part of a revolution, whether military or not.
* Guerrilla – someone who uses unconventional military tactics. The term tends to refer to groups engaged in open conflict, rather than underground resistance. It was coined during the Peninsula War in Spain against France.
* Montoneras – they were a type of irregular forces that were formed in the 19th century in Latin America.
* Franc-tireur – French irregular forces during the Franco-Prussian War. The term is also used in international legal cases as a synonym for unprivileged combatant (for example the Hostages Trial [1947–1948]).
* Militia – military force composed of ordinary citizens.
* Ordenanças – The Portuguese territorial militia system from the 16th century to the 19th century. From the 17th century, it became the third line of the Army, serving both as local defense force and as the mobilization system that provided conscripts for the first (Regular) and second (Militia) lines of the Army.
* Partisan – In the 20th century, someone part of a resistance movement. In the 18th and 19th century, a local conventional military force using irregular tactics. Often used to refer to resistance movements against the Axis Powers during the Second World War.
* Freedom fighter – A type of irregular military in which the main cause, in their or their supporters&#x27; view, is freedom for themselves or others.
* Paramilitary – An organization whose structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not part of a country&#x27;s official or legitimate armed forces.
* Terrorist – An irregular military that targets civilians and other non-combatants to gain political leverage. The term is almost always used pejoratively. Although reasonably well defined, its application is frequently controversial.
* False flag or pseudo-operations – Troops of one side dressing like troops of another side to eliminate or discredit the latter and its support, such as members of the Panzer Brigade 150, commanded by Waffen-SS commando Otto Skorzeny in Operation Greif during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II and Selous Scouts of the Rhodesian Bush War.
* Insurgent – An alternate term for a member of an irregular military that tends to refer to members of underground groups such as the Iraqi Insurgency, rather than larger rebel organizations like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
* Fifth column - A group that carries out sabotage, disinformation, espionage, and/or terrorism within a group that responds to external enemies
* Bandit - It is generally treated as an organized crime, but it has the character of a resistance movement depending on the political and social situation.
* Private army - Combatants who owe their allegiance to a private person, group, or organization.
* Mercenary or &quot;soldier of fortune&quot; – Someone who is generally not a national in a standing army or not otherwise an inherently-invested party to an armed conflict who becomes involved in an armed conflict for monetary motives or for private gain. Mercenaries are often explicitly hired to fight or provide manpower or expertise in exchange for money; material wealth or, less commonly, political power. Mercenaries are often experienced combatants or former regular soldiers who decided to sell their combat experience, skill or manpower to interested parties or to the highest bidder in an armed conflict. Famous historic examples of &quot;professional&quot; or organized (often &quot;career&quot;) mercenaries include the Italian &quot;condottieri&quot;, or &quot;contractors&quot;, leaders of &quot;free agent&quot; mercenary armies that provided their armies to the various Italian city-states and the Papal states during the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance Italy in exchange for profit, land or power. However, not all soldiers deemed to be &quot;mercenaries&quot; are &quot;professional&quot; or &quot;career&quot; mercenaries, and many mercenaries may be simply opportunists or persons with no prior combat experience. Whether a combatant is truly a &quot;mercenary&quot; may be a matter of controversy or degree, as financial and national interests often overlap, and most standing regular armies also provide their soldiers with some form of payment. Furthermore, as reflected in the Geneva Convention, mercenaries are generally provided less protection under the rules of war than non-mercenaries, and many countries have criminalized &quot;mercenary activity&quot;.

Intense debates can build up over which term is to be used to refer to a specific group. Using one term over another can strongly imply strong support or opposition for the cause.

It is possible for a military to cross the line between regular and irregular. Isolated regular army units that are forced to operate without regular support for long periods of time can degrade into irregulars. As an irregular military becomes more successful, it may transition away from irregular, even to the point of becoming the new regular army if it wins.

==Regular military units that use irregular military tactics==

Most conventional military officers and militaries are wary of using irregular military forces and see them as unreliable, of doubtful military usefulness, and prone to committing atrocities leading to retaliation in kind. Usually, such forces are raised outside the regular military like the British SOE during World War II and, more recently, the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Center. However at times, such as out of desperation, conventional militaries will resort to guerilla tactics, usually to buy breathing space and time for themselves by tying up enemy forces to threaten their line of communications and rear areas, such as the 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry and the Chindits.

Although they are part of a regular army, United States Special Forces are trained in missions such as implementing irregular military tactics. However, outside the United States, the term special forces does not generally imply a force that is trained to fight as guerillas and insurgents. Originally, the United States Special Forces were created to serve as a cadre around which stay-behind resistance forces could be built in the event of a communist victory in Europe or elsewhere. The United States Special Forces and the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Center can trace their lineage to the OSS operators of World War II, which were tasked with inspiring, training, arming and leading resistance movements in German-occupied Europe and Japanese occupied Asia.

In Finland, well-trained light infantry Sissi troops use irregular tactics such as reconnaissance, sabotage and guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.

The founder of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Mao Zedong actively advocated for the use of irregular military tactics by regular military units. In his book On Guerrilla Warfare, Mao described seven types of Guerilla units, and argues that &quot;regular army units temporarily detailed for the purpose (of guerilla warfare),&quot; &quot;regular army units permanently detailed (for the purpose of guerilla warfare),&quot; and bands of guerillas created &quot;through a combination of a regular army unit and a unit recruited from the people&quot; were all examples of ways in which regular military units could be involved in irregular warfare. Mao argues that regular army units temporarily detailed for irregular warfare are essential because &quot;First, in mobile-warfare situations, the coordination of guerilla activities with regular operations is necessary. Second, until guerilla hostilities can be developed on a grand scale, there is no one to carry out guerilla missions but regulars.&quot; He also emphasizes the importance for the use of regular units permanently attached to guerilla warfare activities, stating that they can play key roles in severing enemy supply routes.

== Effectiveness ==
While the morale, training and equipment of the individual irregular soldier can vary from very poor to excellent, irregulars are usually lacking the higher-level organizational training and equipment that is part of regular army. This usually makes irregulars ineffective in direct, main-line combat, the typical focus of more standard armed forces. Other things being equal, major battles between regulars and irregulars heavily favor the regulars.

However, irregulars can excel at many other combat duties besides main-line combat, such as scouting, skirmishing, harassing, pursuing, rear-guard actions, cutting supply, sabotage, raids, ambushes and underground resistance. Experienced irregulars often surpass the regular army in these functions. By avoiding formal battles, irregulars have sometimes harassed high quality armies to destruction. 

The total effect of irregulars is often underestimated. Since the military actions of irregulars are often small and unofficial, they are underreported or even overlooked. Even when engaged by regular armies, some military histories exclude all irregulars when counting friendly troops, but include irregulars in the count of enemy troops, making the odds seem much worse than they were. This may be accidental; counts of friendly troops often came from official regular army rolls that exclude unofficial forces, while enemy strength often came from visual estimates, where the distinction between regular and irregular were lost. If irregular forces overwhelm regulars, records of the defeat are often lost in the resulting chaos. 

==History==
By definition, &quot;irregular&quot; is understood in contrast to &quot;regular armies&quot;, which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia. In Ancient warfare, most civilized nations relied heavily on irregulars to augment their small regular army. Even in advanced civilizations, the irregulars commonly outnumbered the regular army.

Sometimes entire tribal armies of irregulars were brought in from internal native or neighboring cultures, especially ones that still had an active hunting tradition to provide the basic training of irregulars. The regulars would only provide the core military in the major battles; irregulars would provide all other combat duties.

Notable examples of regulars relying on irregulars include Bashi-bazouk units in the Ottoman Empire, auxiliary cohorts of Germanic peoples in the Roman Empire, Cossacks in the Russian Empire, and Native American forces in the American frontier of the Confederate States of America.

One could attribute the disastrous defeat of the Romans at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest to the lack of supporting irregular forces; only a few squadrons of irregular light cavalry accompanied the invasion of Germany when normally the number of &quot;foederati&quot; and auxiliaries would equal the regular legions. During this campaign the majority of locally recruited irregulars defected to the Germanic tribesmen led by the former auxiliary officer Arminius.
During the decline of the Roman Empire, irregulars made up an ever-increasing proportion of the Roman military. At the end of the Western Empire, there was little difference between the Roman military and the barbarians across the borders.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s modernisation of warfare with the invention of conscription, the Peninsular War led by Spaniards against the French invaders in 1808 provided the first modern example of guerrilla warfare. Indeed, the term of &quot;guerrilla&quot; itself was coined during this time.

As the Industrial Revolution dried up the traditional source of irregulars, nations were forced take over the duties of the irregulars using specially trained regular army units. Examples are the light infantry in the British Army.

=== Irregular regiments in British India ===

Prior to 1857 Britain&#x27;s East India Company maintained large numbers of cavalry and infantry regiments officially designated as &quot;irregulars&quot;, although they were permanently established units. The end of Muslim rule saw a large number of unemployed Indian Muslim horsemen, who were employed in the army of the EIC. British officers such as Skinner, Gardner and Hearsay had become leaders of irregular cavalry that preserved the traditions of Mughal cavalry, which had a political purpose because it absorbed pockets of cavalrymen who might otherwise become disaffected plunderers. These were less formally drilled and had fewer British officers (sometimes only three or four per regiment) than the &quot;regular&quot; sepoys in British service. This system enabled the Indian officers to achieve greater responsibility than their counterparts in regular regiments. Promotion for both Indian and British officers was for efficiency and energy, rather than by seniority as elsewhere in the EIC&#x27;s armies. In irregular cavalry the Indian troopers provided their horses under the &quot;silladar&quot; system. The result was a loose collection of regiments which in general were more effective in the field than their regular counterparts. These irregular units were also cheaper to raise and maintain and as a result many survived into the new Indian Army that was organized following the great Indian Rebellion of 1857.

=== Irregular military in Canada before 1867 ===
Before 1867, military units in Canada consisted of British units of volunteers.

During French rule, small local volunteer militia units or colonial militias were used to provide defence needs. During British control of various local militias, the Provincial Marine were used to support British regular forces in Canada.

=== Other instances of irregulars ===

Use of large irregular forces featured heavily in wars such as the Three Kingdoms period, the American Revolution, the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War, the Franco-Prussian War, the Russian Civil War, the Second Boer War, Liberation war of Bangladesh, Vietnam War, the Syrian Civil War and especially the Eastern Front of World War II where hundreds of thousands of partisans fought on both sides.

The Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army began as a peasant guerilla force which in time transformed itself into a large regular force. This transformation was foreseen in the doctrine of &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot;, in which irregular forces were seen as being able to engage the enemy and to win the support of the populace but as being incapable of taking and holding ground against regular military forces.

==Irregulars in today&#x27;s warfare==
Modern conflicts in post-invasion Iraq, the renewed Taliban insurgency in the 2001 war in Afghanistan, the Darfur conflict, the rebellion in the North of Uganda by the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army, and the Second Chechen War are fought almost entirely by irregular forces on one or both sides.

The CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Center (SAC) is the premiere American paramilitary clandestine unit for creating or combating irregular military forces. SAD paramilitary officers created and led successful units from the Hmong tribe during the Laotian Civil War in the 1960s and 1970s. They also organized and led the Mujaheddin as an irregular force against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s, as well as the Northern Alliance as an irregular insurgency force against the Taliban with US Army Special Forces during the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and organized and led the Kurdish Peshmerga with US Army Special Forces as an irregular counter-insurgency force against the Kurdish Sunni Islamist group Ansar al-Islam at the Iraq-Iran border and as an irregular force against Saddam Hussein during the war in Iraq in 2003.

Irregular civilian volunteers also played a large role in the Battle of Kyiv during the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine.

<text>Strășeni () is a city and municipality of about 20,000 inhabitants in central Moldova, the administrative center of Strășeni District. The city administers one village, Făgureni.

There are several legends about its name. One tells that the name of the region is derived from &quot;strașnic&quot;, a Romanian adjective that can mean &quot;scary&quot;, &quot;terrible&quot;, and the story goes that in former times this region was covered by a fearsome forest.

Nowadays, Strășeni is famous for its wine. The &quot;Strășeni vineyard&quot;, west of Chișinău, is renowned for its sparkling white wines. A little farther north is the Romănești winery, one of the largest locally and the one-time leading producer of wines in the USSR. One of its more famous products is a Bordeaux-type red.

==Demographics==
According to the 2014 census, the population of Strășeni amounted to 18,376 inhabitants, a decrease compared to the previous census in 2004, when 19,090 inhabitants were registered. Of these, 8,840 were men and 9,536 were women. 


&quot;Footnotes&quot;: 

* &quot;There is an ongoing controversy regarding the ethnic identification of Moldovans and Romanians.&quot;

* &quot;Moldovan language is one of the two local names for the Romanian language in Moldova. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence, thus giving official status to the name &quot;Romanian&quot;.&quot;

==Media==
* Vocea Basarabiei 102.3

==Points of interest==
* Strășeni TV Mast, a 355-metre (1165&#x27;) tall, guyed mast for FM radio and TV broadcasting built in 1984–85.

==Twin towns and sister cities==

He was born in Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire in what is now part of Ukraine. After graduation from the Vladimir of Kiev Cadet Corps and elite , he joined the Imperial Russian Army at age 18 as a cornet in the 12th Hussars Regiment.

Samsonov fought in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78. After this war he attended the Nikolaevsky Military Academy in St. Petersburg. On November 4, 1888, he was appointed senior aide to the staff of the 20th Infantry Division, and from July 10, 1885, to February 4, 1889, served as Senior Staff Adjutant to the Caucasus Grenadier Division. From March 11, 1890, through July 26, 1896, he worked at various assignments at the Warsaw Military District. He subsequently became commandant of the Elisavetgrad Cavalry School. During the Boxer Rebellion (1900), Samsonov commanded a cavalry unit. During the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Samsonov commanded a cavalry brigade of the Ussuri Siberian Cossack Division. He was promoted to command all Russian cavalry forces in the First Siberian Army Corps following the Russian defeat at the Battle of Telissu. His forces subsequently protected the Russian flanks at the Battle of Liaoyang. Through these conflicts Samsonov gained a reputation as an energetic and resourceful leader, but some observers criticized his strategic abilities. He had no command experience preparing him to command an army of thirteen divisions.

In 1906, Samsonov became Chief of staff of the Warsaw Military District, and in 1909 was Governor-General of Russian Turkestan and commander of the Turkestan Military District. He was also commander of the Semirechye Cossacks.

== The Great War==

=== Command of the Russian Second Army ===
At the start of World War I, Samsonov received the command of the Russian Second Army for the invasion of East Prussia, which was defeated by the German Eighth Army under the command of General Maximilian von Prittwitz. Samsonov advanced slowly into the south-western corner of East Prussia, intending to link up with the Russian First Army, commanded by General Paul von Rennenkampf, which had started advancing into the north-east section of East Prussia. However, lack of communications between the two armies, and with the rear command of the Northwest Army Group, hindered co-ordination.

It is sometimes claimed that the poor coordination between Samsonov and Rennenkampf during the campaign was based on their personal antagonism towards each other. This antagonism is said to have been based on an incident after the Battle of Liaoyang during the Russo-Japanese War where Samsonov had publicly quarrelled with Rennenkampf on the landing platform of a railway station, and that the two were mutual lifetime enemies. However, the original source of this story is considered to be Max Hoffmann, at that time a colonel on the staff of the German Eighth Army. His claim of first hand knowledge of the disagreement is contradicted by the injuries to Rennenkampf at the time. Hoffman appears to have advanced this story during planning sessions, in support of his argument that Rennenkampf would not come to the aid of Samsonov. He argued that the German Eighth Army was free to use all of its forces in the attack on the Russian Second Army to their south, without fear of a counter-attack from their rear by the Russian First Army.

=== Battle of Tannenberg ===

Rennenkampf and the Russian First Army were the first to encounter the German Eighth Army, winning the Battle of Gumbinnen. The defeat led the German High Command to dismiss von Prittwitz and his chief of staff, replacing them with General (later Field Marshal) Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff. Hindenburg and Ludendorff arrived on the Eastern Front and decided to attack Samsonov&#x27;s advancing forces with the full weight of the Eighth Army. Hindenburg and Ludendorff were strengthened in making this decision by intercepted Russian wireless communications, which indicated that Rennenkampf and the Russian First Army could not reach the proposed battle in time to be of assistance, and by an intercepted order from Samsonov, showing the movement of his forces. The armies made contact on August 22 and for six days the numerically superior Russians had some success. However, by August 29 the Germans had surrounded Samsonov&#x27;s Second Army in the woods between Allenstein and Willenberg. The rout that followed was named the Battle of Tannenberg by Hindenburg, to compensate for a defeat of the Teutonic Knights by the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania at the same location five centuries earlier.

=== Retreat and suicide ===

Samsonov attempted to retreat, but with his army now trapped in a German encirclement, the German forces killed or captured most of his troops. Only 10,000 of the 150,000 Russian soldiers managed to escape the encirclement. At least 92,000 Russian troops were taken prisoner, and between 300 and 500 Russian guns had been captured, out of the Second Army&#x27;s initial total of some 600. Over 30,000 Russian soldiers were estimated dead or missing.

Samsonov and a small group of staff officers and men attempted to escape the encirclement, at first on horseback, and then on foot, over swampy ground, in the darkness of the night of August 29. Samsonov repeatedly was heard to say &quot;The Tsar trusted me. How can I face him after such a disaster?&quot; They reached the town of Willenberg late at night, but found it was held by the Germans. At approximately 1 a.m. on August 30, Samsonov slipped away from his party into the forest. A shot rang out. The Russians were not able to find his body in the darkness, but were eventually able to make their way to safety.

A German search party eventually found Samsonov&#x27;s body in the adjacent forest, a bullet wound in his head and a revolver in his hand. The Germans buried Samsonov in Willenberg. In 1916, through the intercession of the International Red Cross, the Germans transferred his body to his widow, who was able to bury him in Russia.

<text>Gaganendranath Tagore (17 September 1867 – 14 February 1938) was an Indian painter and cartoonist of the Bengal school. Along with his brother Abanindranath Tagore, he was counted as one of the earliest modern artists in India.

==Life and career==
Gaganendranath Tagore was born at Jorasanko into a family whose creativity defined Bengal&#x27;s cultural life. Gaganendranath was the eldest son of Gunendranath Tagore, grandson of Girindranath Tagore and a great-grandson of Prince Dwarkanath Tagore. His brother Abanindranath was a pioneer and leading exponent of the Bengal School of Art. He was a nephew of the poet Rabindranath Tagore and the paternal great-grandfather of actress Sharmila Tagore.
Gaganendranath received no formal education but trained under the watercolourist Harinarayan Bandopadhyay. In 1907, along with his brother Abanindranath, he founded the Indian Society of Oriental Art which later published the influential journal &quot;Rupam&quot;. Between 1906 and 1910, the artist studied and assimilated Japanese brush techniques and the influence of Far Eastern art into his own work, as demonstrated by his illustrations for Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Jeevansmriti&quot; (1912). He went on to develop his own approach in his &quot;Chaitanya&quot; and &quot;Pilgrim&quot; series. Gaganendranath eventually abandoned the revivalism of the Bengal School and took up caricature. The &quot;Modern Review&quot; published many of his cartoons in 1917. From 1917 onwards, his satirical lithographs appeared in a series of books, including &quot;Play of Opposites&quot;, &quot;Realm of the Absurd&quot; and &quot;Reform Screams&quot;.

Between 1920 and 1925, Gaganendranath pioneered experiments in modernist painting. Partha Mitter describes him as &quot;the only Indian painter before the 1940s who made use of the language and syntax of Cubism in his painting&quot;. From 1925 onwards, the artist developed a complex post-cubist style.

Gaganendranath also took a keen interest in theatre, and wrote a children&#x27;s book in the manner of Lewis Carroll, &quot;Bhodor Bahadur&quot; (&#x27;Otter the Great&#x27;).

<doc id="1299891" wikidata="Q469603" url="?curid=1299891" title="Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine">
<text>Charles (c. 953 – 22 June 992×995) was the duke of Lower Lorraine from 977 until his death.

==Life==
Born at Reims in the summer of 953, Charles was the son of Louis IV of France and Gerberga of Saxony and the younger brother of King Lothair. He was a sixth-generation descendant of Charlemagne. When his father was captured by the Normans and held, both his sons were demanded as ransom for his release. Queen Gerberga would only send Charles, who was then handed over and his father was released into the custody of Hugh Capet.

In or before 976, he accused Lothair&#x27;s wife, Emma, daughter of Lothair II of Italy, of infidelity with Adalberon, Bishop of Laon. The council of Sainte-Macre at Fismes (near Reims) exonerated the queen and the bishop, but Charles maintained his claim and was driven from the kingdom, finding refuge at the court of his cousin, the emperor Otto II. Otto promised to crown Charles as soon as Lothair was out of the way and Charles paid him homage, receiving back Lower Lorraine.

In August 978, Lothair invaded Germany and captured the imperial capital of Aachen, but failed to capture either Otto or Charles. In October, Otto and Charles in turn invaded France, devastating the land around Reims, Soissons and Laon. In the latter city, the chief seat of the kings of France, Charles was crowned by Theodoric I, Bishop of Metz. Lothair fled to Paris and was besieged there but a relief army of Hugh Capet forced Otto and Charles to lift the siege on 30 November. Lothair and Capet, the tables turned once more, chased the German king and Charles back to Aachen and retook Laon.

Around 979, Charles transferred the relics of Saint Gudula from Moorsel to the Saint Gaugericus chapel on Saint-Géry Island near Brussels. This is generally accepted as the time when the city was founded. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.

As he had been a vassal also of Lothair, Charles&#x27; acts on behalf of Otto were considered treason and he was thereafter excluded from the throne. On Lothair&#x27;s death (986), the magnates elected his son Louis V and on the latter&#x27;s death (987), Hugh Capet. Thus, the House of Capet came to the throne over the disgraced and ignored Charles. Charles&#x27; unexceptional marriage and his lack of wealth are two of the reasons he was denied the throne. Charles made war on Hugh, even taking Rheims and Laon. However, on Maundy Thursday (26 March) 991, he was captured, through the perfidy of the Bishop Adalberon, and was imprisoned by Hugh in Orléans. He was succeeded as Duke of Lower Lorraine by his son Otto.

There is uncertainty over the date and place of Charles&#x27; death. The necrology of the diocese of Liège dates Charles&#x27; death to 22 June without specifying the year. Sigebert of Gembloux records it under the year 991, but he may have confused it with his capture, since two documents of January 992 seem to imply that Charles was still alive. One was dated by a supporter to the fifth year of &quot;Charles king in waiting&quot; (&quot;sperante Karolo rege&quot;), the other is dated by Hugh&#x27;s reign, &quot;Charles being thrown in prison&quot; (&quot;Karolo trusus in carcere&quot;). He must have been dead by 995, when Adalberon and Count Odo of Blois tried to install his son Louis on the throne. His death is sometimes placed in Orléans, but this is pure conjecture.

The &quot;Historia Francorum Senonensis&quot;, written between 1015 and 1034, propagated the view that Charles was the rightful king in 987 and Hugh a usurper. In 1666, the lead sarcophagus of Charles was discovered in the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht with an inscription bearing the date 1001. This appears to be the date of his interment in Maastricht, however, and not of his death. Probably his son Otto had his body moved. While the sarcophagus remains, the original inscription has been lost.

==Family==
In 970 Charles married Adelaide of Troyes. Together he and Adelaide had:

*Otto, succeeded as Duke of Lower Lotharingia
*Ermengarde, who married Albert I, Count of Namur
*Gerberga of Lower Lorraine (b. 975–1018), who married Lambert I, Count of Louvain
*Louis ( 989 – 1023)
*Charles (b. 989)

<doc id="1299895" wikidata="Q4012" url="?curid=1299895" title="Paul von Rennenkampf">
<text>Paul Georg Edler von Rennenkampf (; – 1 April 1918) was a Baltic German nobleman, statesman and general of the Imperial Russian Army who commanded the 1st Army in the invasion of East Prussia during the initial stage of the Eastern front of World War I. He also served as the last commander of the Vilna Military District.

Rennenkampf gained a reputation as an effective cavalry commander during the Boxer Rebellion and the Russo-Japanese War. Following service in the latter, he led the detachment that suppressed the Chita Republic during the 1905 Russian Revolution. This earned him further promotion, and by the outbreak of World War I Rennenkampf was commander of the Vilna Military District, whose forces were used to form the 1st Army under his command.

He led the 1st Army in the invasion of East Prussia and won an early victory at Gumbinnen in late August 1914, but was relieved of command after defeats at Tannenberg, the Masurian Lakes and Łódź, although he was later proved innocent for the mistakes made in the Battle at Łódź by an official inquiry into his actions. Rennenkampf was shot by the Bolsheviks in Taganrog during the Red Terror in 1918.

== Biography ==
=== Origin ===

Paul Georg Edler von Rennenkampff was born on 29 April 1854 in the manor of Konofer (now Konuvere, Märjamaa parish, Estonia) in the then Governorate of Estonia; one of eight children of Captain Karl Gustav Edler von Rennenkampff and Anna Gabriele Ingeborg Freiin von Stackelberg, he came from the Konofer-Tuttomäggi-Sastama branch of the Baltic German Rennenkampff family and was of Lutheran faith. His paternal ancestors were of Westphalian origin, originating in Osnabrück. On his mother&#x27;s side was the Stackelberg family, whose common ancestor was Carl Adam von Stackelberg, a Swedish cavalry officer and participant in The Great Northern War; he thus remained a fifth cousin of the Russo-Japanese War general Georg von Stackelberg.

=== Early career ===
As a youth, Rennenkampf was educated in the Tallinn Knight and Cathedral School (; ), a German-speaking school established especially for local Baltic German aristocrats. Upon graduation, he joined the military as a non-commissioned officer in the 89th Infantry Regiment. He graduated the in Helsinki and began his military career with the Lithuanian 5th Lancers Regiment. He graduated at the top of his class from the Nicholas General Staff Academy in St. Petersburg (or at the first category) in 1881.

From late August to late November 1884, he was an over-officer of the 14th Army Corps, specialising in instruction. In late September 1886, he was the chief of staff of the Warsaw Military District, serving under General and later Field Marshal Count Gurko.

In early 1888, he was appointed to the Kazan Military District. Rennenkampf subsequently became the senior adjutant to the headquarters of the Don Cossacks. In late October 1889, he was appointed headquarters officer for special assignment at the 2nd Army Corps headquarters. In late March 1890, he was appointed the chief of staff of the Osowiec Fortress in Russian Poland. The same year he was promoted to colonel, after which he served in several different regiments until late November 1899, when he was appointed chief of staff of the Transbaikal region, and was promoted to major general.

=== Boxer Rebellion ===
From 1900 to 1901, Rennenkampf participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China. He distinguished himself with extreme success during the campaign, receiving both the 4th and 3rd classes of the Order of St. George for military distinction.


In mid-September, Rennenkampf left for Dagushan, leaving hundreds of troops to protect the mint and arsenal. After several days of resetting, he attacked and occupied Tieling and Mukden with his detachment attacked, maintaining control until October. Within this time, the general survived numerous assassination attempts; during one encounter, when he and his troops entered a manor, three Chinese men with spears charged toward the general, with a Cossack, Fyodor Antipyev, saving the general and being stabbed himself. For military distinction, he was awarded the Order of St. George of the 3rd degree.

The raid of the cavalry detachment of Rennenkampf was one of the most successful and decisive military operations in the Boxer Rebellion. In just three months of actions, Russian troops had taken over 2,500m2 of land, the best trained Chinese troops stationed at Heilongjiang were defeated and pushed out of Manchuria, and rebel detachments were dispersed, leading to the cessation of the Chinese resistance movement against their Russian occupiers.

=== Russo-Japanese War ===

In February 1904, after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Rennenkampf was appointed commander of the Trans-Baikal Cossack Division. In June, he was promoted to lieutenant-general in recognition of his military distinction.

In late June 1904, while scouting the Japanese positions at Liaoyang, he was shot in the leg, shattering the shin. After less than two months he returned to active service, without fully recovering from his wounds. In the Battle of Mukden, Rennenkampf again distinguished himself commanding the Tsinghechensky detachment, which was stationed at the left flank of the 1st Manchurian Army led by General Nikolai Linevich. During the battle, he showed great persistence, which, combined with other reinforcements, was able to repulse Field Marshal Kawamura&#x27;s offensive.

According to some historians and writers, after the Battle of Mukden, a personal conflict occurred between Rennenkampf and General Samsonov and it came to an exchange of blows, which made the two of them lifelong foes; some other historians argue that there could be no clashes between the generals. The main source of this rumor is the memoirs of the German general Max Hoffmann, who was an observer with the Imperial Japanese Army during the war; capable of personally observing relations among Russian generals, he would subsequently become one of Rennenkampf&#x27;s enemies in the First World War. In his memoirs, which refer again to rumors, Hoffmann mentioned that both generals quarrelled in Liaoyang after the battle; however, this claimed argument remains physically impossible, as Rennenkampf was seriously injured at this time.

After the war, Rennenkampf commanded numerous army corps, including the 7th Siberian Army Corps, the 3rd Siberian Army Corps and the 3rd Army Corps.

=== 1905 Russian Revolution ===
After the war, Rennenkampf commanded an infantry battalion with several machine guns which followed a train in Harbin, restoring communications between the Manchurian Army and Western Siberia. Within this time, the Revolution broke out; this task remained interrupted via a revolutionary movement in Eastern Siberia, the Chita Republic. Rennenkampf and his forces were sent to suppress the movement, successfully restoring order in Chita.

After this campaign, he remained a target for assassination by numerous rebel groups and several plots to assassinate him were planned. In late October 1906, he faced an assassination attempt while walking along the street with two of his adjutants; a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, who was sitting on a bench, threw a bomb onto the general&#x27;s feet. However, rather than destroying Rennenkampf and his adjutants, the explosion merely stunned them. The attempted assassin was later arrested and tried.

The decisive actions of Rennenkampf in the course of a war and in the suppression of rebellion led to further advancements in his career. In late December 1910, he was promoted to General of the Cavalry, then promoted to General-Adjutant in 1912. A further promotion to commander-in-chief of all troops within the Vilna Military District followed in mid-January 1913.

=== World War I ===

In the beginning of the First World War, Rennenkampf was appointed commander of the 1st Army of the Northwestern Front, under commander-in-chief General Yakov Zhilinsky; his rival Samsonov was the commander of the 2nd Army invading East Prussia from the south. On 7 August 1914, Rennenkampf and his troops entered East Prussia from the east. While retreating upon orders from the defending 8th Army commander, General Maximilian von Prittwitz, a gap formed between the Russian armies; exploiting this, the Imperial German 1st Division, commanded by General Hermann von François, counterattacked at the Battle of Stallupönen, initiating the Eastern Front of the war. Although it was a victory for the Germans, Russian artillery bombardment halted the German offensive, causing François to withdraw to the town of Gumbinnen.

Rennenkampf continued his advance, defeating the 8th Army under the Prittwitz&#x27;s command at the Battle of Gumbinnen. But due to a later incorrect assessment made by Zhilinsky, the victory at Gumbinnen did not develop. After the battle, Rennenkampf was ordered by Zhilinsky to launch an offensive against the heart of East Prussia, Königsberg, but his army did not link up with Samsonov&#x27;s 2nd Army due to a mistake made by Zhilinsky. As a result, the German 8th Army under the new commander, General (later field marshal) Paul von Hindenburg, charged through the gap, then encircled and nearly wiped out the 2nd Army near Allenstein (the Battle of Tannenberg). When the desperate Samsonov sent his appeals for help, instead of immediately replying and heading south to aid Samsonov, Rennenkampf almost completely ignored the appeal. When he finally began to head south, he and his men started too late and proceeded more slowly than they should have, contributing to the defeat of the 2nd Army. After the battle, Samsonov, fearing being held responsible for the defeat, committed suicide.

After the 2nd Army&#x27;s annihilation at the Battle of Tannenberg, Rennenkampf&#x27;s army took over all the defenses along the Deyma, Lava and the Masurian Lakeland. On 7 September, the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes began, as the Germans attacked the left flank of the 1st Army with a powerful detachment. Zhilinsky broke his promise to provide Rennenkampf with reinforcements from other formations; as a result, the 1st Army had to retreat hurriedly. The 2nd Army Corps, led by General Vladimir Slyusarenko, resisted desperately, as did Rennenkampf himself, who transferred all the cavalrymen, reserves, and troops from the right to left flank of the 20th Army Corps in order to avoid encirclement by Hindenburg. By 15 September, he skillfully withdrew his men from encirclement and withdrew behind the Neman, saving all the remaining troops he had. After this failure, despite his best efforts to blame Rennenkampf for the defeat, Zhilinsky was dismissed and was replaced by the General Nikolai Ruzsky.

In mid-November at Łódź, due to the indecisiveness and mistakes made by Ruzsky, the 1st Army was unable to prevent the XXV Reserve Corps of General Reinhard von Scheffer-Boyadel from escaping out of the encircling movement, causing the front to retreat. A sharp conflict then broke out between the two men. After the incident, Rennenkampf was relieved from his position. His acts during the battle became the subject of a special commission under General Peter von Baranoff; he was even considered being tried for treason, due to his ethnic background. He was then dismissed in early October 1915 &quot;for domestic reasons with a uniform and pension&quot;.

After that, he stayed in Petrograd, living in retirement with his wife Vera until the Bolshevik coup. However, his retirement was extremely unsettling, as he was falsely accused of being a traitor, and all across Russia, on streets and in public places, people insulted him for his actions. Even Baltic Germans accused him, as Vera recalled, as being a &quot;terrible Russophile&quot;. All these events plunged Rennenkampf into deep moral suffering.

Army chief of staff General Nikolai Yanushkevich wrote the following about the issue of German Generals in the Russian Army to the Minister of War, General Sukhomlinov:

In a further investigation, it was revealed that it was Ruzsky&#x27;s strategic mistakes that had let Scheffer-Boyadel and his troops escape from the encirclement. This, however, did not bring Rennenkampf back to service.

=== February Revolution ===
Rennenkampf was arrested shortly after the February Revolution, as many of the revolutionaries remembered his role in the suppression of the Chita Republic back in 1905. He was then questioned by the Extraordinary Investigative Commission of the Russian Republic, although he was not charged with any crimes.

=== October Revolution and death ===
Rennenkampf was arrested again after the October Revolution and, like many other tsarist officials, was imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress. He was released shortly afterwards due to deteriorating health. After that, he, along with several other tsarist generals, went south to Taganrog, his wife&#x27;s birthplace, and lived under the protection of a merchant named Smokovnikov.

After the Red Army took over the city, Rennenkampf disappeared, disguised as a Greek subject named Mandusakis, but was tracked down by the Red Army and identified, after which he was brought to the headquarters of the Bolsheviks under the order of Red Army commander-in-chief Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko. After arriving, the former general was offered a command in the Red Army, with refusal implying death. Rennenkampf refused to defect to the Bolsheviks, saying:

At the time, the Germans were advancing toward Taganrog; the Czechs and Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Army were as well. As a result, Rennenkampf was taken hostage by the Bolsheviks and brought near the railway tracks running from the Martsevo station to the Baltic. Upon arrival, Rennenkampf was forced to dig his own grave, then stabbed before being executed with a bullet to the temple.

=== Aftermath ===

According to Rennenkampf&#x27;s wife Vera&#x27;s memoirs, after his death, the Whites were told that Rennenkampf was on the way to Moscow. In May 1918, after the Whites had taken over Taganrog, a stick was found stuck in the ground near the railway tracks running from the Martsevo station to the Baltic Plant. After they dug up the grave, they found several bodies, including one nearly naked with a bullet wound to the head. When they took the corpses to a local cemetery (now the Taganrog Old Cemetery) in the city, Rennenkampf&#x27;s wife Vera arrived at the cemetery and identified the nearly naked corpse as her husband Paul.

The White troops and Rennenkampf&#x27;s wife held a funeral that fulfilled Rennenkampf&#x27;s wish of being buried in an unmarked mass grave with other victims of the Red Terror. But other than her memoirs, there is no evidence of Rennenkampf&#x27;s burial in the Old Cemetery in Taganrog.

In recent years, researchers at the Hoover Institution archives of the Stanford University found several photos taken during the civil war. In the photos, a marked grave was clearly seen on the left with &quot;P. K. Rennenkampf&quot; written on it. This allowed historians and researchers to determine and establish the final resting place of Rennenkampf at the burial ground in the Old Cemetery in Taganrog.

=== Family ===
Born into a large and wealthy family, Rennenkampf had five brothers and two sisters. His brothers included Woldemar Konstantin von Rennenkampff (1852–1912), a cavalryman and the director of the Russian gun industry, and Georg Olaf von Rennenkampff (1859–1915), a chief of powder manufacturing in Zawiercie.

Rennenkampf married four times. In 1882, he married Adelaide Franziska Thalberg, with whom he had three children: Adelaide Ingeborg (1883–1896), Woldemar Konstantin (1884) and Iraida Hermaine (1885–1950). Thalberg died in 1888 after only six years of marriage.

In 1890, in Vilno, Rennenkampff married Lydia Kopylova, with whom he had one more child, Lydia (1891–1937). He then married Evgenia Dmitryevna Grechova, with whom he had no children.

Finally, in 1907 in Irkutsk he married Vera Nikolayevna Krassan (Leonutova), with whom he had a daughter, Tatyana (1907–1994), and adopted Vera&#x27;s daughter Olga (1901–1918) from her first marriage. Unlike his other marriages, Rennenkampf&#x27;s marriage with Vera was long and happy. Vera, as the wife of the commander of the Vilna Military District, was a trustee and member of a branch of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. When the war broke out, she participated in organizations that cared for the wounded. In Vera&#x27;s memoirs, she wrote of her founding of the Committee for Assistance to the families of reserve lower ranks, tailoring workshops for the front, and her participation in the formation of the flying car detachment of the Evangelical Red Cross that took the wounded from the battlefield.

After the war and Rennenkampf&#x27;s death, the fate of his family was unknown, but Vera and Tatyana escaped to Paris, France. Olga was murdered on her doorstep the same month as her stepfather&#x27;s murder. The rest of the family either fled to Estonia or back to Germany during the civil war.

==Legacy==
Before his execution, Rennenkampf had asked his wife Vera to make every effort to &quot;whitewash his name from slander&quot;. Vera was not alone in considering her husband to be innocent of the strategic mistakes that led to the Russian defeats in the East Prussian campaign; a significant part of the White émigrés, including generals Baron Wrangel, Anton Denikin, and Nikolai Golovin, shared that view.

To rehabilitate the general&#x27;s image and to &quot;give the light to the real face of General Paul Georg Edler von Rennenkampff&quot;, on the initiative of his wife in November 1936 the historical society of the &quot;Friends of Rennenkampf&quot; (&quot;Les Amis de Rennenkampf&quot;) was founded in Paris. The honorary chairman was Vera herself, and the president of the bureau was the husband of Rennenkampf&#x27;s daughter Tatyana. The honorary committee included the widow of Baron Wrangel – Baroness Olga Mikhailovich, General Nikolai Epanchin, Prince Belosselsky-Belozersky and others.

<text>A scientific celebrity, also known as a celebrity scientist or public scientist, is a scientist who has gained significant public attention, usually through the media. For the general public, scientific celebrities serve to represent science or a field of science. In some instances this can be self-serving in nature or can be at the behest of governmental or corporate interests or to promote the science involved.

With new scientific discoveries scientists come to be publicly known for their contributions. Although this type of recognition has become more common in recent times (coincidental with the rise of celebrity culture), the phenomenon is centuries old. Media attention to science became more pervasive beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s as the variety of media outlets increased and they gave greater attention to scientific progress. Scientific celebrities have had a significant role in the popularization of science.

==Historical examples==

In the late 17th century and early 18th century, Isaac Newton became widely known in the United Kingdom and much of the western world after he published his theories of motion. Others, including Voltaire, promoted Newton&#x27;s reputation; although Newton did not actively promote himself.

Charles Darwin pursued popularity among the general public following his 1859 publication of his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; which explained his theory of evolution. This included distribution of mass-produced photographs of himself and his projects. He carefully selected interviews and public appearances. He responded to his mail with pre-printed responses. Darwin made available low cost editions of his book for reading by the general public. Statuettes of a chimpanzee contemplating a human skull became widely available following the rise of Darwin&#x27;s fame.

==Modern examples==
By 1919, shortly after Albert Einstein published his seminal work on the General Theory of Relativity, he became well-known among the general public around the world. By then, experimental data appeared to support Einstein&#x27;s theories, and this revolutionary new way of thinking of the physical world commanded significant public attention. Science historian Abraham Pais wrote, “Einstein, creator of some of the best science of all time, is himself a creation of the media in so far as he is and remains a public figure.” Einstein&#x27;s rise to celebrity status is traceable to November 1919 as major news outlets such as &quot;The Times&quot; (of London) and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the scientific breakthroughs. Einstein was at times uncomfortable with his celebrity status, as it compromised his privacy. However, he used his fame to advance social causes for which he had strong conviction, such as Zionism, nuclear disarmament, civil rights, and pacifism.

Astronomer Fred Hoyle rose to prominence by 1950, especially in the United Kingdom. He hosted a series of radio broadcasts by the BBC entitled, &quot;The Nature of the Universe&quot;. Hoyle was for a time among the most popular broadcasters in the United Kingdom, and the book version of his radio broadcast was a bestseller.

In the latter part of the 20th century and early 21st century, cosmologist Stephen Hawking achieved celebrity status. This was initially through his research publications on black holes and other aspects of cosmology. In 1988, he published &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, which was a book that provided insight into cosmology for the general public. Hawking&#x27;s celebrity status grew rapidly, and his involvement in popular culture was perpetuated through television and radio appearances, biographical books, and being the subject of a movie, &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;. At times, Hawking suffered from public scrutiny of his private life.

Lists of notable English language popularizers of science and of science communicators are available.

==The Sagan Effect==

Carl Sagan was an accomplished researcher in the field of planetary science by the time he published his 1977 book &quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot;, on the evolution of human intelligence, targeted for general, non-scientific audiences. With this book, Sagan earned the Pulitzer Prize and became famous. In 1980, Sagan hosted the television series , which cemented his status as a scientific celebrity. Time Magazine called Sagan &quot;America&#x27;s most effective salesman of science.&quot;

Sagan was a university professor at the time that he first achieved celebrity status. Influential academic peers perceived Sagan as a popularizer of science and not a serious scholar. He was denied academic tenure at Harvard University, despite his significant achievements as an independent researcher. (He later became a full professor at Cornell University.) Science historian Michael Shermer termed this the &quot;Sagan Effect.&quot; This form of academic snobbery has applied to some other scientific celebrities, including Paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. A 2016 discussion of the Sagan Effect indicated that the effect was continuing to persist at that time, even though it may be in decline as academic institutions have become more engaged in public outreach.

==Role of the media==
The means of media reporting on science and the amount of science reporting have evolved significantly since science reporting first began, just as it has with journalism on most subjects. Early on, scientists gained the publicity necessary for celebrity status through traditional print media, including newspapers, magazines, pamphlets and mailings. The lecture circuit was another means, especially for self-promotion. By the middle of the 20th century, broadcast media such as television and radio and eventually cable television became important outlets. The rise of digital media enabled scientist to directly address the general public. Many other people have become known to the public as a result of media promotion. Heads of state, heads of governmental units and religious leaders have long received this type of media attention in representing interests other than their own. Scientific celebrity is similar, and C. Everett Koop is an example of a scientific celebrity who gain celebrity status through his work for a governmental agency, as Surgeon General of the United States.

A further form of scientific outreach in the digital age is TED Talks. Science is one of the basic themes of Ted Talks, and examples of scientific celebrities who have presented TED Talks include E.O. Wilson, Barry Schwartz, Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker, Brian Greene, and Laura Boykin, among others.

A survey indicates that public acceptance of scientific concepts, particularly evolution, depends on the celebrity scientists who advocate it and on the other concepts that the celebrity advocates. Amy Unsworth and David Voas found that acceptance of evolution could decrease among some religious groups if it is advocated by a celebrity scientist who is perceived as having negative views of the religion, such as Richard Dawkins.

==Science by press release==
At times, some scientists have inappropriately or prematurely publicized their research findings in the media, by press release or press conference. This has typically occurred when the findings have questionable scientific merit, and the scientists appeal directly to the general public. At times the host institution is complicit. This type of science by press release is seen as an example of pathological science. Cold fusion is an example of this behavior.

==Media celebrities==
Some television presenters such as Richard Attenborough, Patrick Moore and David Attenborough have scientific qualifications, and some like Bill Nye have engineering qualifications, but these presenters are primarily known for their own presentations of scientific topics rather than their contributions to the advance of scientific knowledge. Some media outlets have science editors or science reporters who are specifically tasked with reporting on scientific developments. These people often do not have scientific training but rather are professional journalists, a notable example being Jules Bergman of ABC-TV in the United States.

Actor Alan Alda has taken up the cause of aiding scientists in communicating with the general public. His efforts are not limited to scientific celebrities and include scientists that are not well-known. Alda&#x27;s method emphasizes improvisational techniques.

Some celebrities are known for their roles in the media but not for their work in science, such as Mayim Bialik, one of the stars of the television show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, who has a PhD in neuroscience. Another example is actress Danica McKellar who has published original research in the field of mathematics. Another is comedian and science writer Kasha Patel.

<text>The Bishop of Clogher (, ) is an episcopal title which takes its name after the village of Clogher in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Following the Reformation, there are now parallel apostolic successions: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the Roman Catholic Church.

==History==
Clogher is one of the twenty-four dioceses established at the Synod of Ráth Breasail in 1111 and consists of much of south west Ulster, taking in most of counties Fermanagh and Monaghan and parts of Tyrone, Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal. Frequently in the Irish annals the Bishop of Clogher was styled the &quot;Bishop of Oirialla&quot;. Between c. 1140 to c. 1190, County Louth was transferred from the see of Armagh to the see of Clogher. During this period the Bishop of Clogher used the style &quot;Bishop of Louth&quot;. The title &quot;Bishop of Clogher&quot; was resumed after 1193, when County Louth was restored to the see of Armagh.

==Present Ordinaries==
;In the Church of Ireland
The present Church of Ireland bishop is the Right Reverend Dr. Ian W. Ellis, elected in September 2020 and consecrated in April 2021 The Church of Ireland bishop is unique in having two diocesan cathedrals within a single diocese, with one Dean and chapter between them: the Cathedral Church of Saint Macartin, Enniskillen and the Cathedral Church of Saint Macartan, Clogher.

;In the Roman Catholic Church
The current Roman Catholic bishop is the Most Reverend Lawrence Duffy who was appointed by the Holy See on 8 December 2018 and ordained bishop on 10 February 2019. The Roman Catholic bishop&#x27;s seat (cathedra) is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Macartan, Monaghan.

<text>Practical Demonkeeping is a fantasy novel by American writer Christopher Moore, published in 1992. His first novel, it deals with a demon from Hell and his master. The novel has been translated and published in German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian.

==Plot summary==

Travis was born in 1900, yet he has not aged since 1919, because he accidentally called up a demon from hell named &quot;Catch&quot; as his servant, presumably forever. Ever since then, Travis has been trying to get rid of Catch, but he is unable to do so because he has lost the repository of the necessary incantations. He traces their whereabouts to a fictional town called &quot;Pine Cove&quot;, along Big Sur coast, where he thinks the woman he gave them to may be residing. Interactions with the townspeople and with a djinn, who is pursuing Catch, create considerable complications.

Several characters from this novel continue their lives in later novels by Moore. Catch appears in a later book (&quot;&quot;), but a much earlier period of history; in addition, the setting of &quot;Pine Cove&quot; itself is revisited for &quot;The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove&quot; and &quot;The Stupidest Angel&quot;. The fictional town of &quot;Pine Cove&quot; is described as being within easy driving distance of San Luis Obispo, California.

== Reception ==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described &quot;Practical Demonkeeping&quot; as a &quot;Good-natured, often funny, but excessively complicated tale&quot;, observing that &quot;First-novelist Moore throws in more plot twists than the Pacific Coast highway has curves&quot;.

<doc id="1299918" wikidata="Q735666" url="?curid=1299918" title="Reginar II, Count of Hainaut">
<text>Reginar (or Rainier) II (890–932) was Lotharingian magnate who was active from approximately 915 to 932. He was brother of Duke Gilbert of Lotharingia, who died at the Battle of Andernach in 939, and because his son and grandson claimed it, he probably already personally held the fort of Mons in Hainaut as the seat of a county.

==History==
He was the son of Reginar I Longneck, and this means his paternal grandmother was possibly a daughter of Charles the Bald and Ermentrude.

Flodoard&#x27;s Annals, reports under the year 924 that Reginar the brother of Duke Gilbert of Lotharingia already had a son who was given as a hostage during conflicts between several of the Lotharingian magnates of the time.

By 943 he was dead, as evidenced by a charter made in favor of his widowed daughter partly as atonement for his sins.

==Family==
Reginar II had at least three children with Adelaide, daughter of Richard, Duke of Burgundy:
* Reginar III, Count of Hainaut
* Rudolf, possibly a Count in the Hesbaye
* Possibly Liethard or Liechard, a son mentioned in one 966 charter as a son of a Count Reginar.
* A daughter who married to Nibelung, Count of Betuwe.
Upon his death, Reginar was succeeded as Count of Hainaut by his son and namesake.

<doc id="1299919" wikidata="Q1538285" url="?curid=1299919" title="Irish Museum of Modern Art">
<text>The Irish Museum of Modern Art (), also known as IMMA, is Ireland&#x27;s leading national institution for the collection and presentation of modern and contemporary art. It is located in Kilmainham, Dublin.

==History==
Irish art collector Gordon Lambert met with Taoiseach Charles Haughey and &quot;told him if the State would establish a gallery he would donate his collection.&quot; The Irish Museum of Modern Art was established by the Government of Ireland in 1990. It was officially opened on 25 May 1991 by Haughey.

Its first Director was Declan McGonagle, who served for 10 years. He was followed by Enrique Juncosa, and then Sarah Glennie. Annie Fletcher has been Director since 2018.

==Building and grounds==
The Irish Museum of Modern Art is housed in the 17th-century Royal Hospital Kilmainham. The Royal Hospital was founded in 1684 by James Butler, the Duke of Ormonde and Viceroy to Charles II, as a home for retired soldiers and continued in that use for almost 250 years. 

The Royal Hospital is a striking location for displaying modern art. Designed by Sir William Robinson and modelled on Les Invalides in Paris, it is arranged around a courtyard and the interior has long corridors running along series of modest interlocking rooms. The original stables have been restored, extended and converted into artists&#x27; studios, and the museum runs an artist-in-residence programme.

Originally there was another option to build a new purpose-built museum in Dublin&#x27;s docklands, but the Hospital proved to be the more pragmatic choice at the time, however &quot;over the years... the lack of a large exhibition space has on occasion been a drawback.&quot; Additionally, the Royal Hospital lacked adequate storage and by 2003 up to 20 national and international works were discovered to be badly damaged by &quot;humidity and temperature fluctuations&quot;. The Office of Public Works assisted in finding and relocating the bulk of the collection in off-site warehouses, and even a storage container in the museum&#x27;s car park.

==Collection==
IMMA holds the Irish National Collection of modern and contemporary art, consisting of over 3500 works by Irish and international artists. The collection&#x27;s emphasis is on works produced post-1940 and features works by many significant artists including Lucian Freud, Marina Abramović, Louise Bourgeois, Joseph Cornell, Robert Rauschenberg, Sol LeWitt, Louis le Brocquy, Matt Mullican, Roy Lichtenstein and Lawrence Weiner. The collection is fully catalogued and searchable via a dedicated website.

The Hennessy Art Fund for IMMA Collection was launched in 2016 in part as a response to funding cuts preventing the museum from having a viable acquisitions budget to collect the work of emerging and mid-career artists since 2011. The fund is a new multi-year corporate partnership and acquisition fund to purchase works by Irish and Irish based artists that are not yet part of the IMMA National Collection of Contemporary and Modern Art. Prior to this the museum relied heavily on private philanthropy. The Hennessy Art Fund has thus far allowed the collection to acquire the work of Kevin Atherton, David Beattie, Rhona Byrne and Dennis McNulty in 2016; and Ciarán Murphy, Maireád McClean, Mark Garry and Yuri Pattison in 2017.

==Legal status and funding==
The museum is a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital. The company is funded by grant-in-aid through the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and by sponsorship, franchise and own resource income.

<doc id="1299930" wikidata="Q160776" url="?curid=1299930" title="21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg">
<text>The 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Skanderbeg&quot; (1st Albanian) was a German mountain infantry division of the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside, but was never formally part of, the Wehrmacht during World War II. At the post-war Nuremberg trials, the Waffen-SS was declared to be a criminal organisation due to its major involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The division was developed around the nucleus of an ethnic Albanian battalion which had briefly seen combat against the Yugoslav Partisans in eastern Bosnia as part of the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Handschar&quot; (1st Croatian). The rank-and-file were mostly Muslim Albanians with a few hundred Catholic Albanians and mostly German and Yugoslav &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic German) officers and non-commissioned officers, it was given the title &quot;Skanderbeg&quot; after medieval Albanian lord George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, who defended the region of Albania against the Ottoman Empire for more than two decades in the 15th century.

&quot;Skanderbeg&quot; never reached divisional strength, being at most a brigade-sized formation of between 6,000 and 6,500 troops. In May 1944, members of the division arrested 281 Jews in Pristina and handed them over to the Germans, who transported them to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. The division itself was better known for this action and for murdering, raping, and looting in predominantly Serb areas than for participating in combat operations on behalf of the German war effort. Its only significant military actions took place during a German anti-Partisan offensive in the German occupied territory of Montenegro in June and July 1944. Following those operations, the unit was deployed as a guard force at the chromium mines in Kosovo, where it was quickly overrun by the Partisans, leading to widespread desertion. Reinforced by German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; personnel and with fewer than 500 Albanians remaining in its ranks, it was disbanded on 1 November 1944. The remaining members were incorporated into the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. After the war, divisional commander &quot;SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS&quot; August Schmidhuber was found guilty of war crimes by a court in Belgrade and executed in 1947.

==History==
===Background===
On 7 April 1939, five months prior to the outbreak of World War II, the Kingdom of Italy invaded Albania. The country was overrun in five days, and Italian King Victor Emmanuel III accepted the crown offered by the Parliament of Albania. The Royal Albanian Army was incorporated into the Royal Italian Army and a viceroy was appointed to administer the country as a protectorate. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, Italian Albania was expanded to include adjacent parts of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia incorporated mainly from the Yugoslav &quot;banovinas&quot; (regional subdivisions) of Vardar and Morava. Most of Kosovo was annexed to Albania, and in the beginning, Albanians living there enthusiastically welcomed the Italian occupation. Some Kosovo Albanians even suggested that Albanians were &quot;Aryans of Illyrian heritage&quot;. Although officially under Italian rule, the Albanians in Kosovo were given control of the region and encouraged to open Albanian-language schools, which had been banned by the Yugoslav government. The Italians also gave the inhabitants Albanian citizenship and allowed them to fly the flag of Albania. The Royal Italian Army expelled most of the Serbs and Montenegrins that had settled Kosovo during the interwar period. The Kosovo Albanians despised the Serbs for the oppression they had experienced at their hands during the Balkan Wars, World War I, and under Yugoslav rule. They took advantage of their changed circumstances, attacked their Serb neighbours, and burned the homes of as many as 30,000 Serb and Montenegrin settlers.

Albania remained occupied by Italy until its surrender to the Allies in September 1943. In August of that year, faced with the imminent collapse of the Italian war effort, Germany deployed the 2nd Panzer Army to the Balkans to take over areas previously occupied by Italy. One of the Italian areas seized by the Germans was Albania, where the XXI Mountain Corps of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Lothar Rendulic&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Army had been deployed. A Wehrmacht plenipotentiary general, and a special representative of Heinrich Himmler, SS-&quot;Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS und Polizei&quot; Josef Fitzthum, were both based in the Albanian capital of Tirana. The Germans took control of all Albanian forces that had been collaborating with the Italians prior to their capitulation, including the &quot;Balli Kombëtar&quot;, an anti-communist and nationalist militia. The Germans strengthened the Albanian army and gendarmerie, but quickly decided those troops were unreliable. That year, a number of Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak region were recruited into the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Handschar&quot; (1st Croatian), a Waffen-SS division composed largely of Bosnian Muslims and Croats with mostly German officers, that operated in the puppet Independent State of Croatia (). A key recruiter amongst Albanians for the Waffen-SS was &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Karl von Krempler. For about six months the division included about 1,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment (I/2), which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28). The division later recruited a further 500 men from the Sandžak. The Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini assisted in organising and recruiting Muslims into the Waffen-SS and other units. The Mufti also visited in order to bless and inspect the 13th SS Division, during which he used the Nazi salute.

The formation of an Albanian Waffen-SS division was Fitzthum&#x27;s idea, initially opposed by the German Foreign Ministry representative for the Balkans Hermann Neubacher, and also by the head of the Reich Security Main Office &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei&quot; Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who influenced Himmler to shelve it. But the Albanian government supported the idea; in the face of increasing difficulties Himmler soon changed his mind, and in February 1944 the idea received Adolf Hitler&#x27;s approval.

===Formation===
In February 1944, Hitler approved the creation of an Albanian Waffen-SS division that was to serve only inside Kosovo, and was intended to protect ethnic Albanians but remain under German control. It was meant to be one of three Muslim Waffen-SS divisions serving in the Balkans, the other two being the 13th SS Division and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS &quot;Kama&quot; (2nd Croatian). Himmler&#x27;s goal was to expand Waffen-SS recruiting in the Balkans and form two corps of two divisions each, with one corps to operate in the region of Bosnia in the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and together would form a Balkan Waffen-SS mountain army of five divisions.
In March 1944, Bedri Pejani, the chairman of the Second League of Prizren, an organisation created after the Italian surrender to advance the interests of Kosovo Albanians, proposed to Hitler that a force of 120,000–150,000 Kosovo Albanian volunteers be raised to fight the Yugoslav and Albanian partisans. Pejani asked the German leadership to give the Albanians equipment and supplies to fight the communist insurgency, and requested the expansion of the borders of the German puppet state of Albania at the expense of the German occupied territory of Serbia and the German occupied territory of Montenegro. These requests were not fulfilled. Nevertheless, in April 1944, Himmler ordered the establishment of the new Albanian volunteer division that Hitler had authorised. It was subsequently named after the medieval Albanian warrior Skanderbeg. By this point, the Germans and some members of the Albanian puppet government believed that about 50,000 ethnic Albanians could be recruited to join the Waffen-SS. The Germans had initially envisioned a force of 10,000–12,000 men for the Albanian SS division. Himmler saw the Muslim Albanians as a potential source of manpower in Germany&#x27;s war against the Yugoslav Partisans, who faced significant difficulties in recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join their ranks.

On 17 April 1944, the Albanian battalion of the 13th SS Division was transferred via rail directly from combat in Bosnia to Kosovo to form part of the new Albanian division. The head of Waffen-SS recruitment, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Gottlob Berger, reported to Himmler that the Albanians &quot;... were quite sad about leaving.&quot; Himmler himself expected &quot;great usefulness&quot; from the unit since the Albanians that fought in the 13th SS Division had proven to be &quot;highly motivated and disciplined&quot; in the fight against the Partisans in the NDH. After the war, Bosnian Muslim former members of the 13th SS Division stated that while with the division the Albanians had shot unarmed civilians and were &quot;very brutal&quot;.

On 23 May, Fitzthum noted the failure of the Albanian units that had been used in operations against the Partisans. He reported that he had dissolved four Albanian battalions organised by the Wehrmacht, describing most Albanian army and gendarmerie officers as &quot;totally corrupt, unusable, undisciplined and untrainable.&quot; The Germans found that Kosovo Albanians were more cooperative than Albanians from Albania-proper. This was mainly because they feared a return to Yugoslav rule. Thus, many of the division&#x27;s recruits were Kosovo Albanians, although some were refugees from Albania-proper. The quality of most of these recruits was poor, and only between 6,000 and 6,500 were considered suitable to receive training. Those that were accepted were a combination of about 1,500 former Royal Yugoslav Army prisoners of war, elements of the failed Albanian army and gendarmerie, volunteers from both pre-war and expanded Albania, and conscripts from families that had more than two sons. Unlike the Albanians in the Handschar division, who received extensive training in France and then Neuhammer training grounds in Germany, the new recruits underwent a very short training period of only six weeks. The Albanians may have joined for a range of reasons, including access to modern weapons and military training, to help revise the borders of Albania, revenge, and even the opportunity for looting.

The enlistment of Albanian civilians was organised in close cooperation with the Albanian puppet government. In June 1944, Neubacher successfully displaced Pejani, whom he considered &quot;insane&quot;. The Albanian Minister of the Interior and new chairman of the Second League of Prizren, Xhafer Deva, was a key factor in recruiting Albanians for the new division. Fitzthum, who had developed a close friendship with Deva, noted that the right-wing and anti-Serb politician was vital for German recruitment efforts. In contrast to the 13th SS Division, the use of Islam as an incentive to join the Waffen-SS disappeared completely from the German agenda, while the utilisation of ethnic tensions became much more important. No field imam is documented in the new division and ideological training was avoided entirely, because the Germans feared that such instruction would upset their new recruits. According to Nazi propaganda, the division was to source its manpower exclusively from Muslim Albanians, but the reality was different. While the vast majority of the division&#x27;s Albanians were Bektashi or Sunni Muslims, &quot;several hundred&quot; Albanian Catholics also served in the division.

===Operations===
====May–August 1944====
The division was founded as the &quot;21. Waffen-SS Gebirgsdivision der SS Skanderbeg (albanische Nr.1)&quot; on 1 May 1944, as part of the XXI Mountain Corps. Most or all of the division&#x27;s officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and specialists were German, and were mainly provided by the 7th and 13th SS Divisions, which noticeably weakened those formations. The divisional artillery regiment was formed from the 1st Albanian Artillery Regiment. The division was placed under the command of SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; August Schmidhuber, who was promoted to SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; in June. Members took a religious oath using the Quran, pledging &quot;jihad against unbelievers.&quot; The division was originally equipped with captured Italian Carro Armato M15/42 tanks, which proved to be unreliable. Its garrison was located in the town of Prizren.

The division was to be responsible for security in Kosovo, including transport routes, the defence of economically important objects such as the chrome ore mines in Kukës and Đakovica, as well as offensive action against Yugoslav Partisans operating in the region. Men who had already served in the 13th SS Division were also deployed as guards at a concentration camp in Pristina. Early on, it became clear that most of the division&#x27;s Muslim Albanian members seemed to be interested only in settling scores with their Christian Serb adversaries, who became the target of numerous atrocities. In order to put a stop to the crimes, the Germans had to disarm battalions of the division in the towns of Peć and Prizren and arrest the Albanian officers, with one commanding officer even being sent to prison in Germany. On 14 May 1944, members of the division raided Jewish homes in Pristina, arrested 281 Jews and handed them over to the Germans, who sent them to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. The historian Noel Malcolm describes this event as &quot;the most shameful episode in Kosovo&#x27;s wartime history.&quot; The division was later involved in a massacre of Albanian partisans. It was also responsible for the expulsion of up to 10,000 Slavic families from Kosovo as new Albanian settlers arrived from the poor areas of northern Albania. The arrival of these Albanians was encouraged by Italian authorities, and it is estimated that as many as 72,000 Albanians were settled or re-settled in Kosovo during the war. Between 28 May and 5 July 1944, the division apprehended a total of 510 Jews, communists and other anti-fascists and turned them over to the Germans. It also carried out retaliatory hangings of suspected saboteurs.

In June 1944, &quot;Skanderbeg&quot; engaged in large-scale field manoeuvres in eastern Montenegro. In Andrijevica, the division summarily executed more than 400 Orthodox Christian civilians. It participated in Operations Endlich (Finally) and Falkenauge (Hawkeye) in June and July, as well as Operation Draufgänger (Daredevil), the first phase of Operation Rübezahl, which ran from 5 to 22 August. During Operation Draufgänger &quot;Skanderbeg&quot; was the main force used by the Germans. These operations were focused on the destruction of strong Partisan forces in the Đakovica, Peć and Mokra Gora areas. During the operation on 28 July 1944, the division together with the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, massacred around 550 Serb villagers in the settlement of Velika, in Plav, Montenegro. By the end of Operation Draufgänger, more than 400 men of the division had deserted or otherwise gone missing. According to Neubacher, the division was carelessly committed to fighting in the early stages of its training and performed poorly. Between 18 and 27 August, the division fought the Partisans in and around Debar but failed to capture the city. During the summer of 1944, Deva was sidelined within the League. Fitzthum was so concerned about the impact that this would have on the development of the division that he wrote to Himmler. By the end of August 1944, the Germans had decided that the division was only of use for basic guarding duties. Some members were charged with guarding chromium mines near Kosovo before the area was overrun by the Partisans. In the ensuing clashes, one of the division&#x27;s regiments lost more than 1,000 men and many Albanians deserted. Some of the desertions occurred after a Partisan offensive northeast of Gusinje. Army Group E reported that the division&#x27;s performance showed that it had &quot;absolutely no military value.&quot;

====September–November 1944====
On 1 September 1944, members of the division stationed in Tetovo and Gostivar mutinied, killing their German officers and NCOs. By this time, the division numbered fewer than 7,000 men, less than one third of its intended strength. Within two months of its initial deployment, 3,500 had deserted. Himmler brought in 3,000–4,000 &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German navy) personnel from Greece to make up the numbers, but this had little effect on the division&#x27;s fighting ability. The desertions were mainly caused by Germany&#x27;s defeats, serious shortfalls in food and equipment, as well as from observing constant overflights by the United States Army Air Force, Allied propaganda, and the approaching end of Germany&#x27;s military hegemony in the Balkans. Further reasons for the escalating number of desertions included the news that both Bulgaria and Romania had joined the Allies, Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s amnesty which ended on 15 September, and a demand by Albania&#x27;s Party of Labour that fighting-age men join the National Liberation Front.

By the beginning of October 1944, the division&#x27;s strength had fallen to about 4,900 men, fewer than 1,500 of whom were fit for combat. Between April and October, 3,425 had deserted, constituting over half the division&#x27;s strength. Schmidhuber reported that even the 697 members of the battalion that had served in the 13th SS Division had deserted. The unit was blighted by shortages of equipment and armaments, and a lack of German staff to train new recruits, as demonstrated by the fact that over the summer and autumn only a single battalion had been readied for combat. Schmidhuber held his men in contempt, and he, his superiors, and Fitzthum attempted to justify their failure to create an effective security force by denigrating the Albanians&#x27; culture and military reputation. Schmidhuber also linked the failure of the division to the lack of time for proper military training, ideological training and the absence of suitable instructors. Later, less-involved members of the Wehrmacht stated that the principal issue regarding the unit&#x27;s reliability may have been that the Germans did not work closely with the Albanians at the local level. In mid-October, the division was engaged in heavy fighting around Đakovica. It also aided the Wehrmacht in its orderly withdrawal from Kosovo, covering the Wehrmacht&#x27;s flanks and engaging the Partisans. By this time, desertions had significantly affected the division&#x27;s strength, and its 86 officers and 467 NCOs were left with a force of only 899 men, about half of whom were Albanian. On 24 October, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Alexander Löhr, the commander of Army Group E, ordered that all Albanian members of the division be disarmed and released. Between 19 September and 23 October, 131 anti-fascist guerrillas had been shot or hanged by members of the division acting on Schmidhuber&#x27;s orders.

On 1 November 1944, the division was disbanded. Kosovo Albanians took up arms against the Partisans upon learning that the region would not be unified with Albania after the war, despite earlier Partisan promises. Atrocities occurred when 30,000 Partisans were sent to Kosovo to quell Albanian resistance in the region. Between 3,000 and 25,000 Kosovo Albanians were killed in the ensuing violence.

==Aftermath and legacy==
The remaining German troops and former naval personnel were reorganised as the regimental &quot;Kampfgruppe Skanderbeg&quot; under the command of SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Alfred Graf. The unit withdrew from the Kosovo region in mid-November along with the rest of the German troops in the area. Many Serbs and Montenegrins then took revenge against the region&#x27;s ethnic Albanians, especially collaborators and those who had been members of the division. In his strongly apologetic history of the 7th SS Division, which he commanded at the time, Otto Kumm wrote that &quot;Kampfgruppe Skanderbeg&quot; reached Ljubovija on the Drina river, it was placed under the command of the 7th SS Division, which was securing the river crossings in that area. According to Kumm, the &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; held the towns of Zvornik and Drinjača during the first half of December 1944 as part of the Ljubovija bridgehead. It withdrew across the Drina and fought its way north, towards Brčko on the Sava river, where it relieved the Wehrmacht forces holding the town. In late December, the &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot;&#x27;s assault gun battery was committed to the Syrmian Front at Vinkovci. The remainder of the &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; was deployed to Bijeljina.

In January 1945, the handful of naval personnel that survived were transferred to the 32nd SS Volunteer Grenadier Division 30 Januar, and the remnants of the former division were reorganised as II Battalion of the 14th SS Volunteer Mountain Infantry Regiment of the 7th SS Division. On 21 January 1945, Schmidhuber was promoted to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS&quot; and placed in command of the 7th SS Division. After the war, he was found guilty of war crimes and hanged. In February 1945, the battalion was disbanded altogether and its remaining manpower was assigned to the German police regiment near Zagreb.

The division itself was considered to have been a military failure. Not one of its members was awarded an Iron Cross while serving in it. Schmidhuber and the staff of XXI Mountain Corps blamed the division&#x27;s failure solely on the Albanian personnel. Schmidhuber claimed that Albanians had stagnated culturally since Skanderbeg&#x27;s time in the fifteenth century, and both he and the corps staff claimed that the Albanians had not developed national or state traditions. Schmidhuber argued that the legend of Albanian military achievements was just a saga. Further, he claimed that &quot;[w]ith a light mortar you can basically chase him [the Albanian] around the world. During the attack he goes only as far as he finds something to steal or sack. For him, the war is over when he captures a goat, a ploughshare or the wheel of a sewing machine.&quot; Fitzthum was one of the harshest critics of their soldiers. Fitzthum complained to Hitler personally: &#x27;For the currently existing Albanian formations an alteration in the future cannot be expected to be brought about even by thorough training. They will never become a serious and employable troop&#x27;. Fitzthum went as far as saying that &quot;the Albanian soldier is undisciplined and cowardly&quot;. Fitzthum additionally angrily wrote to Himmler, that one battalion dissolved after being attacked by a few planes and the rest just disappeared. Professor Paul Mojzes writes that the division was better known for committing atrocities against Serbs than it was for contributing to the German war effort. Its role in deporting Jews from Kosovo has been challenged by the Albanian historian Shaban Sinani, who claims that the division did not participate in any deportations on the Germans&#x27; behalf. It was reported that some soldiers from the division deserted the division to join the partisan unit led by Gani Kryeziu after refusing to fight it. 

The post-war Nuremberg trials made the declaratory judgement that the Waffen-SS was a criminal organisation due to its major involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the killing of prisoners-of-war and atrocities committed in occupied countries. Excluded from this judgement were those who were conscripted into the Waffen-SS and had not personally committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. 

During the Kosovo War of 1998–1999, the American journalist Chris Hedges alleged that some Kosovo Liberation Army leaders were directly descended from members of the division and were ideologically influenced by it. Malcolm has challenged this claim.

==Insignia==
The division&#x27;s identification symbol, used on its vehicles, was a black Albanian double-headed eagle. Despite its short existence, a collar patch depicting the goat-crested helmet of Skanderbeg was designed and manufactured for the division, but it was withdrawn from service after a trial as it was unrecognisable from a distance. As a result, officers of the division wore the collar patch with the SS runes, and enlisted ranks wore a plain black collar patch. Photographs exist of a machine-woven cuff band with the title &quot;Skanderbeg&quot;, but this was awarded to the 14th SS Volunteer &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; Regiment of the 7th SS Division in the latter part of 1944, and not to this division. Albanian members of the division wore an arm shield on their upper left arm depicting a black Albanian double-headed eagle on a red shield with black backing. Many of the division&#x27;s Muslim members wore traditional grey-coloured skull caps with the SS eagle and death&#x27;s head on the front instead of the standard SS field cap. Others wore the traditional Albanian highlander hat, the &quot;qeleshe&quot;.

==Order of battle==

*50th Waffen &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; (Mountain Infantry) Regiment of the SS (1st Albanian) (I, II, III battalions)

<text>Afragola (; , ) is a city and (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Naples, in Italy. It is one of the 100 largest Italian cities (the ones that have a population of more than 63,000 inhabitants).

The communal territory, measuring , borders the municipalities of Acerra, Casalnuovo di Napoli, Caivano, Cardito and Casoria, forming a single metropolitan area of around 100,000 inhabitants. The &quot;comune&quot; of Afragola is one of the most densely populated of the country.

==History==

The area of modern Afragola was already settled in ancient times by the Samnites. Older remains, belonging to an early Bronze Age settlement buried by a Vesuvius eruption in the 19th century BC, were found in 2005.

According to a tradition now recognized as false, the town was founded in the Middle Ages, in 1140, by Roger II of Sicily, who assigned the land to its veterans. It is more likely that the city stemmed from the merger of several villages and churches already existing here. The territory was originally held by the archbishops of Naples, but from 1576 it was directly subjected, as an autonomous community, to the Kings of Naples.

==Main sights==

*Baroque sanctuary-basilica of St. Anthony&#x27;s sanctuary-basilica. It was begun in 1633 and has a nave with two aisles, internally decorated with marbles. The bell tower was constructed from 1590.
*The castle, documented from 1495, was likely built from around 1420. According to the tradition, it was a residence of queen Joanna II of Naples. It currently houses a childhood school.
*Santa Maria d&#x27;Ajello Church, founded in 1190. It houses works by Giovan Angelo Criscuolo, Alessandro Viola (1695) and Angelo Mozzillo.
*San Marco in Sylvis Church, built around 1179. On its external wall is a slab on which, according to the legend, once sat both St. Mark and San Gennaro.
*San Marco all&#x27;Olmo Church, built in 1615
*Palazzo Migliore (17th century)
*San Giorgio Martire: Parish church built in 1695-1702

==Transport==

Napoli Afragola railway station was designed by the architect Zaha Hadid and opened in 2017. This station is only used by high-speed trains on the Rome–Naples high-speed railway line, which link Afragola to many Italian cities including Bologna, Milan, Florence and Turin.

Afragola&#x27;s bus network is managed by CTP (the &quot;Consorzio Trasporto Pubblico&quot; or Public Transport Consortium).

The proposed Line 10 of the Naples Metro will also serve Afragola.

==Criminality and social issues==
Afragola is the seat of one of the largest camorra clans of the area, led by Anna Mazza. In 1999 and 2005, the communal council was disbanded by rule of the President of Italian Republic due to mafia allegiance of some of its members.

Along with most of the nearby communes, Afragola also suffers from high pollution rates, as well as a high unemployment rate; unreported employment is also widespread.

<doc id="1299933" wikidata="Q16248789" url="?curid=1299933" title="Language identification in the limit">
<text>Language identification in the limit is a formal model for inductive inference of formal languages, mainly by computers (see machine learning and induction of regular languages). It was introduced by E. Mark Gold in a technical report and a journal article with the same title.

In this model, a &quot;teacher&quot; provides to a &quot;learner&quot; some &quot;presentation&quot; (i.e. a sequence of strings) of some formal language. The learning is seen as an infinite process. Each time the learner reads an element of the presentation, it should provide a &quot;representation&quot; (e.g. a formal grammar) for the language. 

Gold defines that a learner can &quot;identify in the limit&quot; a class of languages if, given any presentation of any language in the class, the learner will produce only a finite number of wrong representations, and then stick with the correct representation. However, the learner need not be able to announce its correctness; and the teacher might present a counterexample to any representation arbitrarily long after.

Gold defined two types of presentations:
* Text (positive information): an enumeration of all strings the language consists of.
* Complete presentation (positive and negative information): an enumeration of all possible strings, each with a label indicating if the string belongs to the language or not.

==Learnability==
This model is an early attempt to formally capture the notion of learnability.
Gold&#x27;s journal article introduces for contrast the stronger models
* &quot;Finite identification&quot; (where the learner has to announce correctness after a finite number of steps), and 
* &quot;Fixed-time identification&quot; (where correctness has to be reached after an apriori-specified number of steps).
A weaker formal model of learnability is the &quot;Probably approximately correct learning (PAC)&quot; model, introduced by Leslie Valiant in 1984.

==Examples==


It is instructive to look at concrete examples (in the tables) of learning sessions the definition of identification in the limit speaks about.
# A fictitious session to learn a regular language &quot;L&quot; over the alphabet {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;} from text presentation:&lt;BR&gt;In each step, the teacher gives a string belonging to &quot;L&quot;, and the learner answers a guess for &quot;L&quot;, encoded as a regular expression. In step 3, the learner&#x27;s guess is not consistent with the strings seen so far; in step 4, the teacher gives a string repeatedly. After step 6, the learner sticks to the regular expression (&quot;ab&quot;+&quot;ba&quot;)*. If this happens to be a description of the language &quot;L&quot; the teacher has in mind, it is said that the learner has learned that language.&lt;BR&gt;If a computer program for the learner&#x27;s role would exist that was able to successfully learn each regular language, that class of languages would be &quot;identifiable in the limit&quot;. Gold has shown that this is not the case.
# A particular learning algorithm always guessing &quot;L&quot; to be just the union of all strings seen so far:&lt;BR&gt;If &quot;L&quot; is a finite language, the learner will eventually guess it correctly, however, without being able to tell when. Although the guess didn&#x27;t change during step 3 to 6, the learner couldn&#x27;t be sure to be correct.&lt;BR&gt;Gold has shown that the class of finite languages is identifiable in the limit, however, this class is neither finitely nor fixed-time identifiable.
# Learning from complete presentation by telling:&lt;BR&gt;In each step, the teacher gives a string and tells whether it belongs to &quot;L&quot; () or not (). Each possible string is eventually classified in this way by the teacher.
# Learning from complete presentation by request:&lt;BR&gt;The learner gives a query string, the teacher tells whether it belongs to &quot;L&quot; () or not (); the learner then gives a guess for &quot;L&quot;, followed by the next query string. In this example, the learner happens to query in each step just the same string as given by the teacher in example 3.&lt;BR&gt;In general, Gold has shown that each language class identifiable in the request-presentation setting is also identifiable in the telling-presentation setting, since the learner, instead of querying a string, just needs to wait until it is eventually given by the teacher.

== Gold&#x27;s theorem ==
More formally,

* a &quot;language&quot; formula_1 is a nonempty set, and its elements are called &quot;sentences&quot;.
* a language &quot;family&quot; is a set of languages.
* a language-learning &quot;environment&quot; formula_2 for a language formula_1 is a stream of sentences from formula_1, such that each sentence in formula_1 appears at least once.
* a language &quot;learner&quot; is a function formula_6 that sends a list of sentences to a language.
** This is interpreted as saying that, after seeing sentences formula_7 &quot;in that order&quot;, the language learner guesses that the language that produces the sentences should be formula_8.
** Note that the learner is not obliged to be correct — it could very well guess a language that does not even contain formula_9.
* a language learner formula_6 &quot;learns&quot; a language formula_1 in environment formula_12 if the learner always guesses formula_1 after seeing enough examples from the environment.
* a language learner formula_6 &quot;learns&quot; a language formula_1 if it learns formula_1 in any environment formula_2 for formula_1.
* a language family is &quot;learnable&quot; if there exists a language learner that can learn all languages in the family.

Notes:
* In the context of Gold&#x27;s theorem, sentences need only be distinguishable. They need not be anything in particular, such as finite strings (as usual in formal linguistics).
* Learnability is not a concept for individual languages. Any individual language formula_1 could be learned by a trivial learner that always guesses formula_1.
* Learnability is not a concept for individual learners. A language family is learnable iff there exists &quot;some&quot; learner that can learn the family. It does not matter how well the learner performs for learning languages outside the family. 


Gold&#x27;s theorem is easily bypassed if &quot;negative examples&quot; are allowed. In particular, the language family formula_21 can be learned by a learner that always guesses formula_22 until it receives the first negative example formula_23, where formula_24, at which point it always guesses formula_25.

==Learnability characterization==
Dana Angluin gave the characterizations of learnability from text (positive information) in a 1980 paper.
If a learner is required to be effective, then an indexed class of recursive languages is learnable in the limit if there is an effective procedure that uniformly enumerates &quot;tell-tales&quot; for each language in the class (Condition 1). It is not hard to see that if an ideal learner (i.e., an arbitrary function) is allowed, then an indexed class of languages is learnable in the limit if each language in the class has a tell-tale (Condition 2).

==Language classes learnable in the limit==

The table shows which language classes are identifiable in the limit in which learning model. On the right-hand side, each language class is a superclass of all lower classes. Each learning model (i.e. type of presentation) can identify in the limit all classes below it. In particular, the class of finite languages is identifiable in the limit by text presentation (cf. Example 2 above), while the class of regular languages is not.

&quot;Pattern Languages&quot;, introduced by Dana Angluin in another 1980 paper, are also identifiable by normal text presentation; they are omitted in the table, since they are above the singleton and below the primitive recursive language class, but incomparable to the classes in between.

==Sufficient conditions for learnability==
Condition 1 in Angluin&#x27;s paper is not always easy to verify. Therefore, people come up with various sufficient conditions for the learnability of a language class. See also &quot;Induction of regular languages&quot; for learnable subclasses of regular languages.

===Finite thickness===
A class of languages has finite thickness if every non-empty set of strings is contained in at most finitely many languages of the class. This is exactly Condition 3 in Angluin&#x27;s paper. Angluin showed that if a class of recursive languages has finite thickness, then it is learnable in the limit.

A class with finite thickness certainly satisfies MEF-condition and MFF-condition; in other words, finite thickness implies M-finite thickness.

===Finite elasticity===
A class of languages is said to have finite elasticity if for every infinite sequence of strings formula_26 and every infinite sequence of languages in the class formula_27, there exists a finite number n such that formula_28 implies formula_25 is inconsistent with formula_30.

It is shown that a class of recursively enumerable languages is learnable in the limit if it has finite elasticity.

==Mind change bound==
A bound over the number of hypothesis changes that occur before convergence.

==Other concepts==

===Infinite cross property===
A language L has infinite cross property within a class of languages formula_31 if there is an infinite sequence formula_32 of distinct languages in formula_31 and a sequence of finite subset formula_34 such that:
*formula_35,
*formula_36,
*formula_37, and
*formula_38.

Note that L is not necessarily a member of the class of language.

It is not hard to see that if there is a language with infinite cross property within a class of languages, then that class of languages has infinite elasticity.

==Relations between concepts==
*Finite thickness implies finite elasticity; the converse is not true.
*Finite elasticity and conservatively learnable implies the existence of a mind change bound. 
*Finite elasticity and M-finite thickness implies the existence of a mind change bound. However, M-finite thickness alone does not imply the existence of a mind change bound; neither does the existence of a mind change bound imply M-finite thickness. 
*Existence of a mind change bound implies learnability; the converse is not true.
*If we allow for noncomputable learners, then finite elasticity implies the existence of a mind change bound; the converse is not true.
*If there is no accumulation order for a class of languages, then there is a language (not necessarily in the class) that has infinite cross property within the class, which in turn implies infinite elasticity of the class.

==Open questions==
*If a countable class of recursive languages has a mind change bound for noncomputable learners, does the class also have a mind change bound for computable learners, or is the class unlearnable by a computable learner?

<text>The Ensoniq Performance Sampler (EPS) was one of the first few affordable samplers on the market. It was manufactured from 1988 to 1991 by Ensoniq in Malvern, Pennsylvania, US. The EPS is a 13-bit sampler and replaced the Mirage - widely regarded as the first truly affordable sampling keyboard.

The EPS has a straightforward interface that is easy to use, with configurable controls geared for live performance. Because it has two processors, it can load and play up to eight instruments simultaneously (with another eight on reserve). The display is a 22-character, single-line vacuum fluorescent display. It boots from an integrated floppy disk drive (sourced from Sony or Matsushita), or from a SCSI drive connected to the expansion bay. The EPS has 256 Kwords of RAM on board. Ensoniq offered both a 2x (512 Kword) Memory Expander and a 4x (1 Mword) Memory Expander with SCSI interface. A company called Maartists offered both 4x and 8x memory expanders, allowing a total of 2 Mwords RAM. Extra RAM allows for longer and higher quality samples. The &quot;2x&quot; expander contains one 1x256Kbit and three 4x256Kbit chips, for a total of 13x256Kbits in addition to the onboard memory. The EPS is unusual in having a 13-bit sample memory word length, left-justified into the most significant bits of a 16-bit word.

The EPS uses double-sided, double-density 3.5&quot; disks, formatted to 800k with ten 512-byte sectors per track. It can also read (but not write) Ensoniq Mirage sample disks.

The EPS uses MIDI and can be used as a controller of other instruments or connected to a computer.

The EPS was superseded by the EPS-16 Plus which upgraded the sample size to 16 bits and added a 24-bit effects system. Other improvements include CD-ROM support in the optional SCSI interface and FlashBank storage for the OS and favorite sounds.

==Construction==
The keyboard is of thick plastic construction of a dark gray color with 61 weighted keys. There are assignable pitch, modulation wheels, and two patch select buttons. The interior of the unit is accessed by removing four hex screws under the front of the keyboard and swinging open the rear-hinged control panel.

The whole unit is configurable through a custom operating system (latest version was 2.49 for the EPS and 1.30 for the EPS-16 Plus). After the system boots from the floppy drive, it flashes a &quot;Tuning Keyboard - Hands Off&quot; message while it calibrates its polyphonic after-touch keyboard. The EPS-16 Plus is capable of storing the OS in the optional FlashBank, which removes the need for a boot disk.

An optional Output Expander module allows access to eight discrete mono outputs on the machine, allowing to separately mix levels and effects for each loaded sample.

The key limitations of the EPS were its proprietary disk format, and later a lack of support from Creative Technology, the current owner of Ensoniq. A 19&quot; rack-mount version of both machines were also available in limited numbers.

This model was superseded by the EPS-16 Plus, released in 1991. The EPS-16 Plus is very similar to the EPS. Its main addition is integrated DSP effects and stereo audio routing. Due to the upgrade to 16-bit audio, the Output Expander on the EPS-16 Plus is different, instead providing three pairs of stereo outputs, two from before the new effects chip.

==Use==
The EPS is a performance sampler. Besides the main processor it contains a dedicated sound engine so that playing can be done whilst loading another sample. The main processor handles the I/O while the sound engine is responsible for keeping the audio running without interruption — this made the EPS especially useful for live performance situations.

The interface, although operating through a single-line fluorescent display, offers rapid access to all functions by the intelligent way that functionality is broken into &quot;Modes&quot; and &quot;Pages&quot;.

Modes are: Load, Command, and Edit.

Pages are: Instrument, Sequence, MIDI, and System.

In addition to eight soft instrument buttons, it has a number pad (0-9), four cursor buttons, a value slider, and &#x27;Yes&#x27; - &#x27;No&#x27; buttons.

The vast majority of functionality can be accessed with less than three clicks: Mode - Page - Number Pad.

There is also a dedicated button for Sampling, and three for the built-in sequencer. The EPS-16 Plus also has a dedicated button for configuring the effects DSP.

Easter Egg: There is a hidden menu in the Command-ENV1 page which contains Software Information, the names of the designers, a DC Offset Adjustment, and a keyboard calibration command.

===Instrument===
Instrument pages are prefixed by clicking a Mode (Load, Command, or Edit) -- yielding functions relating to loading, editing, and tweaking EPS sampled instruments. Instruments can contain a number of discrete samples which are patched into Layers - each with their own ADSR-like envelopes and keyboard ranges. A loop editor allows you to define envelopes, cross-fades, and sample start-end, and loop points in real-time. It is possible to modulate the loop start with any source to give complex evolving sounds. On the EPS-16 Plus, the Transwave loop mode allows the start point to be modulated in exact &quot;single-cycle&quot; steps, giving effects similar to the PPG Wave. The Ensoniq manuals were famous for including quality tutorials for sampling and editing new sounds.

===Sequence===
The Sequence pages allow you to define sequences and songs. Simple quantization is available, along with a crude, but effective, step-editor to tweak individual sequence elements. Sequences (with up to eight instruments playing simultaneously) can be assembled into Song Steps. In assembling songs, you can define the number of repetitions of each sequence that comprises a song step. This makes it relatively easy to score and arrange a song.

Sequences depend on having instruments loaded into one of the eight instrument banks in the right order. Banks of instruments can be saved which can be loaded in by a song sequence so that loading the song loads all the appropriate sounds into the right places so everything will play when you start the sequencer. In the EPS-16 Plus, an effect is also assigned to a bank.

===MIDI===
The EPS supports polyphonic-aftertouch on its 61 keys, and therefore allows a fair amount of expression as a MIDI controller. Sys-ex messages are supported over MIDI, and can transmit and receive on multiple MIDI channels simultaneously.

===System===
By using a dedicated sound engine in addition to the main processor, sound generation and disk I/O are handled separately. This allows so-called load-while-play, a feature quite unique at the time. The user can boot the EPS and load some sounds while playing the ones that are already loaded. Then sample in a new sound, only to find that you&#x27;re out of floppies to save your new sample to — the EPS OS will allow you to go ahead, format another floppy disk, and save your new sound without the system function getting in the way of playing the audio.

True to their user-oriented approach, the EPS boot disk not only contains everything needed to run the sampler, but also a tiny operating system with the ability to create a bootable version of itself. This was an improvement on the earlier Mirage sampler, which required a special boot disk with a formatting program, and could not make copies of its own boot disks.

His teams won three NCAA national championships (1999, 2004, 2011), played in four Final Fours, won the 1988 NIT title, and won seventeen Big East Championships, which include 7 Big East tournament championships (1990, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2011) and 10 Big East regular season (1990, 1994–1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006). With his team&#x27;s 2011 NCAA title win, the 68-year-old Calhoun became the oldest coach to win a Division I men&#x27;s basketball title. He won his 800th game in 2009 and finished his NCAA Division I career with 873 victories, ranking 11th all time as of February 2019. From 2018 to 2021, he served as head coach of the University of Saint Joseph men&#x27;s basketball team. Calhoun is one of only six coaches in NCAA Division I history to win three or more championships, and he is widely considered one of the greatest coaches of all time. In 2005, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
A self-described Irish Catholic, Calhoun was born and raised in Braintree, Massachusetts, where he was a standout on the basketball, football, and baseball teams at Braintree High School. After his father died of a heart attack when Calhoun was 15, he was left to watch over his large family that included five siblings.

Although he received a basketball scholarship to Lowell State, he only attended the school for three months after which he returned home to help support his mother and siblings. He worked as a granite cutter, headstone engraver, scrapyard worker, shampoo factory worker, and gravedigger.

After a 20-month leave from higher education, Calhoun returned to college, this time at American International College in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he was given another basketball scholarship. He was the leading scorer on the team his junior and senior seasons, and captained the team in his final year, during which AIC advanced to the Division II playoffs. At the time he graduated, he was ranked as the fourth all-time scorer at AIC. Calhoun graduated in 1968 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology.

==Coaching career==

===High school===
Calhoun began his coaching career at Lyme-Old Lyme High School in Old Lyme, Connecticut in the 1968–69 season after accepting a sixth grade teaching position in that town over the summer. After finishing 1–17 that season, Calhoun returned to Massachusetts after deciding not to complete the necessary certification paperwork to renew his teaching contract (he was certified in Massachusetts and working in Conn. only on a temporary certificate). He then coached one season at Westport (Massachusetts) High.

In 1970, Calhoun accepted a position at Dedham High School as a history / social studies teacher and began building a very strong program. In addition to teaching, he was the school&#x27;s varsity basketball coach and the assistant freshman football coach. In the two years before Calhoun began coaching, the basketball team had only won five games in the previous two seasons. During his first season, the Dedham Marauders went 6–12.

After his first season, Calhoun began a summer basketball league that played five nights a week. The next year, during the 1971–72 season, the team had an undefeated 18–0 season. This was only the second time in Bay State Conference history that a team went undefeated. During the Bay State Conference championship game, there were two seconds left on the clock when the Marauders were playing Needham High School. There was two seconds left on the clock when Charlie Baker inbounded the ball. A Dedham player, Jeff Dillion, stole the ball, laid it up, and Dedham won the game by one point. The team entered the TECH Tournament as the number one seed but lost to North Quincy High School in the semifinals at the Boston Garden.

Calhoun was the guest speaker at the 1995 Dedham High School boys basketball championship banquet, the graduation speaker for Dedham High School&#x27;s class of 2011, and a member of the 2023 class of inductees to the Dedham High School Athletic Hall of Fame.

===Northeastern===
Calhoun was recruited by Northeastern University in Boston to serve as their new head coach. He took the position in October 1972. He transitioned the team from Division II to Division I in 1979.

The Huskies advanced to the Division I tournament 4 times under Calhoun. During his final three seasons, Northeastern achieved automatic bids to the NCAA tournament and had a 72–19 record. He received six regional Coach of the Year accolades at Northeastern and remains the institution&#x27;s all-time winningest coach (245–138).

Former Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis, who played for Calhoun at Northeastern, was a first-round pick in the 1987 NBA draft.

===UConn===
On May 14, 1986, Calhoun was named the head coach at UConn. After completing his first season just 9–19, Calhoun led the Huskies to a 20–14 record in 1988 and a bid to National Invitation Tournament, where they defeated Ohio State to win the NIT championship. In 1990, Calhoun was named the consensus National Coach of the Year after leading the Huskies to their first Big East Conference championship, the NCAA tournament Elite Eight, and a 29–6 record in only his fourth year at the helm.

Calhoun won his first NCAA national championship in 1999, as he led UConn to its first Final Four, ultimately defeating Duke in the championship game in St. Petersburg, Florida. Future NBA standout Richard &quot;Rip&quot; Hamilton led the team to a 77–74 victory. Earlier that year, Calhoun had passed Hugh Greer to become the winningest coach in UConn history.

Calhoun led the Huskies to another national championship in 2004, at the conclusion of a season that saw UConn start and complete the year as the number one team in the nation. UConn standouts Emeka Okafor and Ben Gordon were selected No. 2 and No. 3 in the NBA draft, respectively. Calhoun now holds a 35–12 record with UConn in NCAA tournament play including 3–1 in the Final Four. They lost in the first round for the first time on March 21, 2008, in overtime to San Diego.

During the Jim Calhoun era, the Huskies did well in the Big East Conference with an impressive 220–112 record (.665 winning percentage). The Huskies won or shared conference titles in 1990, 1994–1996, 1998–1999, 2002, 2003 and 2005–2006. UConn also won seven Big East men&#x27;s basketball tournament championships in 1990, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004, and 2011.

On March 2, 2005, he achieved his 700th win at Gampel Pavilion over the Georgetown Hoyas. His friend and Big East rival coach Jim Boeheim also won his 700th game during the previous week. Later in 2005, Coach Calhoun was honored by induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, fittingly, along with Boeheim. On February 25, 2009, he achieved his 800th win at the Bradley Center over Marquette.

Calhoun was the first coach in NCAA history to have won at least 240 games at two different Division I schools. Eddie Sutton later achieved this same feat.

Calhoun also coached 23 UConn players who have moved on to professional ranks.

Calhoun signed a five-year, $16 million contract until 2014.

On April 4, 2011, Calhoun won his third NCAA title as the Huskies defeated Butler 53–41. The victory over Butler made Calhoun, at 68, the oldest coach to win an NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball title. With the win, Calhoun joined John Wooden, Adolph Rupp, Bob Knight, and Mike Krzyzewski as the only coaches to win at least 3 national championships.

On September 13, 2012, Calhoun announced his retirement and the head coaching position was given to assistant coach Kevin Ollie, who eventually was named the permanent head coach.

====Sanctions====
In March 2009, the NCAA investigated potential violations in UConn&#x27;s recruitment of Nate Miles (a scholarship recipient expelled without playing a single game for the Huskies). The NCAA eventually determined that a former UConn team manager, who was attempting to become an NBA agent, helped guide Miles to UConn by giving him lodging, transportation and meals. The former team manager, Josh Nochimson, was deemed a UConn representative under NCAA rules and his actions were therefore ascribed to UConn. As a result, in February 2011, Calhoun was cited by the NCAA for failing to create an atmosphere of compliance and suspended for the first three Big East games of 2011–2012 season. The NCAA&#x27;s chairman of the Committee on Infractions stated, after the penalty was announced, that &quot;the head coach should be aware, but, also in the same frame, the head coach obviously cannot be aware of everything that goes on within the program. However, the head coach bears that responsibility.&quot; The school admitted that it had committed major NCAA violations.

====Health problems====
On February 3, 2003, Calhoun announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He took an immediate leave of absence from the team and underwent surgery three days later to have his prostate removed. He was released from the hospital on February 9 and within days was once again involved in the day-to-day operation of the program. On February 22 Jim Calhoun returned to the sidelines for the team&#x27;s matchup with St. John&#x27;s at Gampel Pavilion, only 16 days after the surgery.

On May 30, 2008, UConn announced that Calhoun was undergoing treatment for squamous cell carcinoma.

On June 13, 2009, Calhoun fell during a charity bike event and broke five ribs.

On January 19, 2010, Calhoun took a leave of absence from the team again for health reasons. Calhoun had a &quot;serious&quot; condition that he wanted to discuss with his family. Calhoun returned to the court to coach the Huskies on February 13.

On February 3, 2012, Calhoun took a medical leave of absence from coaching as a result of spinal stenosis. He returned on March 3, 2012, less than a week after having back surgery, to coach the team to a win over Pittsburgh in the final game of the regular season.

After a left hip fracture, he received while bike riding on August 4, 2012, Calhoun had surgery that same day.

During &#x27;s Calhoun Project documentary, it was revealed that Calhoun had beat Stage 4 stomach cancer at the beginning of his first season at the University of Saint Joseph, a cancer he had for two years.

====Retirement====
Calhoun retired as Connecticut&#x27;s basketball coach on September 13, 2012, closing a 26-year career at UConn.

===Comeback in Division III===
On September 18, 2018, Calhoun was named the first head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball team at the University of Saint Joseph (USJ), an NCAA Division III program in West Hartford, Connecticut. He told the school website: &quot;Whether it&#x27;s Division I or Division III, the kids are the kids, and the game is the game and I&#x27;m looking forward to getting back out on the court and teaching these young men each and every day. I really missed being a part of a team.&quot; Glen Miller became his assistant at USJ. Calhoun&#x27;s 2019–20 team at USJ had a 25-game winning streak before losing in the first round of the Division III postseason tournament.

On November 18, 2021, Calhoun announced he would step down as head coach at St. Joseph, effective immediately. He retired with a career head coaching record of 920–397.

==Personal life==
Calhoun and his wife, Pat, live in Pomfret, Connecticut, have been married since 1967, and have two sons and six grandchildren. They previously also had a home on Long Island Sound in Madison, Connecticut and sold it in 2016.

<doc id="1299954" wikidata="Q7592459" url="?curid=1299954" title="St Ann's Church, Manchester">
<text>St Ann&#x27;s Church is a Church of England parish church in Manchester, England. Although named after St Anne, it also pays tribute to the patron of the church, Ann, Lady Bland. St Ann&#x27;s Church is a Grade I listed building.

==Architecture and setting==
At the beginning of the 18th century, Manchester was a small rural town, little more than a village, with many fields and timber-framed houses. A large cornfield named &quot;Acres Field&quot;, which is now St Ann&#x27;s Square, became the site for St Ann&#x27;s Church. Acresfield was the site of an annual fair from the 13th century until 1823 when it was moved to Knott Mill.

Although the church stood between the market and the collegiate church, both towers could be seen from all directions. It is a neo-classical building, originally constructed from locally quarried, red Collyhurst sandstone although, due to its soft nature, much of the original stone has since been replaced with sandstone of various colours from Parbold in Lancashire, Hollington in Staffordshire, Darley Dale in Derbyshire and Runcorn in Cheshire. When the church was first constructed, the interior was simple, with plain glass windows. However, in the 19th century many changes were made, including the installation of stained glass windows. Some of these were bespoke, and others were adapted from other churches. One such window, on the north side of the church, was designed and made by William Peckitt of York. The furniture includes a Queen Anne altar table, thought to be the only existing one of its kind, and a painting of &quot;The Descent from the Cross&quot; by Annibale Carracci of Bologna, which had previously hung in the nearby St Peter&#x27;s Church prior to is demolition in 1907. 

The tower of the church marks the centre of the city; surveyors used it as a platform to measure distances to other locations. Their benchmark remains visible at the tower door.

At the southeast corner of the square is the Royal Bank of Scotland which is in the Italian palazzo style. It was built in 1848 for Benjamin Heywood&#x27;s bank by J. E. Gregan. In the square there are two statues; the statue of Richard Cobden is by Marshall Wood, 1867; the Boer War Memorial is by Hamo Thornycroft, 1907.

==History==
===Consecration===

The Mosleys were the Lords of the Manor of Manchester and in 1693 the manor was inherited by Lady Ann Bland, daughter of Sir Edward Mosley. Lady Bland was a leader of fashion in Manchester, staunch in her religious and political views as a member of the Low Church Party: she herself at first worshipped at the Presbyterian Church in the centre of the town. In 1695, however, Henry Newcome, the incumbent, died and Lady Bland decided to found a church of her own. In 1708, Parliament was petitioned to seek permission to build a new church, as the population of Manchester was increasing rapidly. On 18 May 1709, Lady Bland laid the foundation stone of a new church at one end of Acres Field. On 17 July 1712, the church was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester and was dedicated to Saint Anne, the Virgin Mary&#x27;s mother, which was a compliment both to the founder and to the reigning monarch, Queen Anne. Lady Bland herself is buried in the Church of St James, Didsbury, where a memorial plaque commemorates her life.

===John Byrom===
As a result of the proximity of St Ann&#x27;s to the collegiate church, there was a time when it was fashionable to attend &quot;the old church&quot; in the morning and &quot;the new church&quot; in the afternoon or vice versa. One of those who did so was John Byrom (1692–1763), author of &quot;Christians Awake&quot;, who played quite a prominent part at St Ann&#x27;s under the first two rectors, despite his Jacobite sympathies.

===Manchester becomes a growing town===

Towards the end of the 17th century, streets had become more numerous in the St Ann&#x27;s district; by 1720, St Ann&#x27;s Square had been laid out and planted with trees in imitation of the fashionable squares of London and Bath. By 1735, buildings had begun to rise on the south side of Acres Field and King Street and Ridgefield came into being. There was now no longer the simple distinction between &quot;the old church&quot; and &quot;the new church&quot;. The rapid growth of Manchester as a result of the Industrial Revolution led to the building of other churches. Then, as the population moved out to the suburbs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many of these churches fell into disuse and were demolished. St Ann&#x27;s holds the memorials from several of these churches, for example Sir Charles Barry&#x27;s St Matthew&#x27;s, Campfield (built 1823–25, demolished 1950).

==Importance to civic life==

St Ann&#x27;s has always been closely associated with the civic life, and its rectors have from time to time acted as chaplain to the Lord Mayor, the county council chairmen and the police. In 1975, the Friends of St Ann&#x27;s Church was formed from the business houses in the parish, to maintain the fabric of this historic building. Renovation work was carried out at St Ann&#x27;s during 2011 (whilst the church remained operational). The work included the repair of its clock, bell, stonework and roof. During renovation work the church was draped in large advertising banners, which was controversial for a Grade I listed building. The church has an active concert schedule, including weekly lunchtime organ recitals (on Wednesdays), monthly professional concerts, and regular piano and chamber music concerts by Royal Northern College of Music students. The church has a four-manual George Sixsmith organ.

<doc id="1299957" wikidata="Q3512091" url="?curid=1299957" title="Telos (journal)">
<text>Telos is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that publishes articles on politics, philosophy, and critical theory, with a particular focus on contemporary political, social, and cultural issues.

Established in May 1968 by Paul Piccone and fellow students at SUNY-Buffalo with the intention of providing the New Left with a coherent theoretical perspective, the journal, which has long considered itself heterodox, has been described as turning to the right politically beginning in the 1980s.

The journal&#x27;s masthead lists its editor as David Tse-Chien Pan and its editor emeritus as Russell A. Berman. Piccone died of cancer in 2004 at age 64.

==History==
The journal was established by Paul Piccone and fellow working-class philosophy students in May 1968 at SUNY-Buffalo, though it was never formally associated with SUNY or any other university. Elisabeth K. Chaves writes that &quot;this non-institutionalization, in academia or elsewhere, helped keep the journal distinct from other positions within the [intellectual] field, and it reveals a kinship to artists within the field of cultural production that choose to practice &#x27;art for art&#x27;s sake,&#x27; disdaining the economic and political power found at the dominant pole.&quot;

According to Chaves, the journal specifically saw its objective as &quot;vindicat[ing] the ineradicability of subjectivity, the teleology of the Western project, and the possibility of regrounding such a project by means of a phenomenological and dialectical reconstitution of Marxism in conjunction with the New Left.&quot; In this light, the journal sought to expand the Husserlian diagnosis of &quot;the crisis of European sciences&quot; to prefigure a particular program of social reconstruction relevant for the United States. In order to avoid the high level of abstraction typical of Husserlian phenomenology, however, the journal began introducing the ideas of Western Marxism and of the critical theory of the Frankfurt School to a North American audience. In a 1971 pamphlet, in reference to its heterodoxy, members of the Chicago Surrealist Group said &quot;Telos&quot; conference organizers were &quot;capable only of promoting the peaceful coexistence of various modes of confusion&quot;.

Over time, &quot;Telos&quot; became increasingly critical of the Left in general, with a reevaluation of 20th century intellectual history, focusing on authors and ideas including the legal philosopher and Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt, federalism, and American populism through the work of Christopher Lasch. Eventually the journal rejected the traditional divisions between Left and Right as a legitimating mechanism for new class domination and an occlusion of new, post-Fordist political conflicts—part of its critique of the New Class or professional-managerial class. This led to a reevaluation of the primacy of culture and to efforts to understand the dynamics of cultural disintegration and reintegration as a precondition for the constitution of that autonomous individuality critical theory had always identified as the telos of Western civilization.

During the journal&#x27;s &quot;conservative turn&quot; in the 1980s, many editorial board members, including Jürgen Habermas, left &quot;Telos&quot;. The academic Joan Braune writes that one cause for the resignations was Piccone&#x27;s support of the United States intervention in Nicaragua. According to Chaves, the journal&#x27;s split with Habermas was due significantly to the second generation of Critical Theory&#x27;s embrace of the linguistic turn. The paleoconservative Paul Gottfried, a former student of Herbert Marcuse, former Republican Party activist, and critic of neoconservatism, joined &quot;Telos&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s. In January 2025, he was not listed on the journal&#x27;s masthead.

European New Right figures such as Alain de Benoist were key contributors to &quot;Telos&quot; in the 1990s. Piccone asserted that the French New Right had incorporated &quot;95 percent of standard New Left ideas&quot;. Joseph Lowndes describes &quot;Telos&quot; as &quot;the major translator&quot; to English of de Benoist and other New Right figures. Their ethnonationalist ideas later influenced the alt-right. 

In 1994, the paleoconservative Sam Francis was a panelist at a &quot;Telos&quot; conference in New York about populism. The audience &quot;shifted uncomfortably in their seats and chuckled in embarrassment&quot; when Francis said the 1947 anti-austerity riots targeting Jews in England were an authentic form of populism to embrace, as recalled by Lowndes. &quot;Telos&quot; had ties with figures of the paleoconservative &quot;Chronicles&quot; magazine, and was sympathetic to the Lega Nord in Italy, though &quot;Telos&quot;″ support for NATO military intervention against Serbia in 1999 to prevent ethnic cleansing was a tension with paleoconservatives.

Noting various criticisms, Timothy Luke, a &quot;Telos&quot; editor, described the journal in a 2005 remembrance of Piccone as &quot;out beyond the margins of the established academy ... featuring the voices of alternative networks recruited from the contrary currents of many different intellectual traditions&quot;. According to Chaves, the journal &quot;always maintained a critical distance from any party or political movement.&quot; &quot;Telos&quot; author John K. Bingley wrote in 2023 that &quot;the clash of divergent opinions&quot; is &quot;at the core of [the journal&#x27;s] identity.&quot;

The journal is published by Telos Press Publishing and the editor-in-chief is David Pan. It is affiliated with the Telos Institute, which hosts annual conferences, select papers from which are published in &quot;Telos&quot;.

==Abstracting and indexing==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in the Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index, Current Contents/Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, and Current Contents/Arts &amp; Humanities. According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2023 impact factor of 0.1.

==Telos Press Publishing==
Telos Press Publishing was founded by Paul Piccone, the first editor-in-chief of &quot;Telos&quot;, and is the publisher of both the journal &quot;Telos&quot; as well as a separate book line. It is based in Candor, New York.

<doc id="1299968" wikidata="Q1573693" url="?curid=1299968" title="Newport Transporter Bridge">
<text>The Newport Transporter Bridge () is a transporter bridge that crosses the River Usk in Newport, South East Wales. The bridge is the lowest crossing on the River Usk. It is a Grade I listed structure.

It is one of fewer than 10 transporter bridges that remain in use worldwide; only a few dozen were ever built. It is one of only two operational transporter bridges in Britain, the other being the Tees Transporter Bridge.

==History==
The bridge was designed by French engineer Ferdinand Arnodin. It was built in 1906 and opened by Godfrey Charles Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar, on 12 September 1906. Newport Museum holds a silver cigar cutter which was presented to Viscount Tredegar on the day of the opening, as a memento of the occasion.

== Design ==
The design was chosen because the river banks are very low at the desired crossing point (a few miles south of the city centre) where an ordinary bridge would need a very long approach ramp to attain sufficient height to allow ships to pass under, and a ferry could not be used during low tide at the site. The river is too narrow for a swing bridge or a bascule bridge (drawbridge).

==Principal dimensions==
A Corporation of Newport drawing dated December 1902 is calibrated in metres. The height of the towers is , and the height to the underside of the main girder truss above the road level is . The span between the centres of the towers is , and the clearance between the towers is quoted as being ; however, including the cantilevered sections, the main girder truss gives the bridge an overall length of . The distance between the centres of the anchorage caissons is . Power to propel the transporter platform or gondola is provided by two electric motors, which in turn drive a large winch, situated in an elevated winding house at the eastern end of the bridge. This winch is sufficient to drive the gondola through its total travel at a speed of .

When compared with Middlesbrough&#x27;s Transporter Bridge, the Newport Transporter is taller, but less in overall length. It also utilizes approximately of steel compared to used to construct Middlesbrough&#x27;s Transporter (not accounting for steel used in foundations or concrete anchors). This difference in weight is mainly due to the Newport bridge making use of cables to support and induce tension into its structure to a far greater extent than the Middlesbrough bridge.

The bridge is a Grade I listed structure, its Cadw listing describing it as &quot;the oldest and largest of the three historic transporter bridges which remain in Britain, and also the largest of eight such bridges which remain worldwide&quot;.

== Other information ==
Today, the bridge is considered an “iconic symbol” of the city of Newport, particularly as a mark of its industrial heritage. As well as a working transport link, the bridge is also open as a tourist attraction – visitors can climb the towers and walk across the upper deck for a small charge. The bridge forms part of the classified highway network and is also where route 4 of the National Cycle Network crosses the River Usk and route 47 begins. It was the focal point of the local millennium celebrations of 2000, where fireworks were fired from its length, and has been featured in several movies and television shows. It was the centre-piece of the Crow Point Festival in September 2006 to celebrate its centenary. It is used for charity events such as sponsored abseils.

===Refurbishment===
The bridge was shut down in 1985 because of wear and tear. Following a £3 million refurbishment, it reopened in 1995. Service was suspended again in December 2008 with the bridge facing a £2 million repair bill. £1.225 million was spent on refurbishment, financed by grants from the Welsh Government, Newport City Council and Cadw. It re-opened on 30 July 2010. The bridge was closed on 16 February 2011, because of operational problems, but re-opened again on 4 June.

===Appearances in popular media===
The transporter bridge provided the setting for some scenes in the 1959 British crime drama film &quot;Tiger Bay&quot;, which was set in Cardiff and therefore gave audiences the impression that the bridge was in Cardiff and not Newport. The bridge also appears in an early scene in the 1972 experimental film &quot;The Other Side of the Underneath&quot; by Jane Arden and features extensively in the 1996 video for the song &quot;Talk to Me&quot; by Newport band 60 Ft. Dolls.

==Visitor centre==
The Visitor Centre is located on the west bank and features exhibits on the history of the bridge, its construction and other transporter bridges around the world. The centre has a painting of David Pearce, the former undefeated Welsh and British Heavyweight Boxing Champion 1983–1985. Pearce used to run up the steps of the Transporter Bridge during his training. The centre is generally open at weekends, but it is currently closed until Summer 2024, while extensive restoration of the bridge structure is performed and a new visitor centre is constructed.

<text>Bobbie Jo Stinnett (December 4, 1981 – December 16, 2004) was a 23-year-old pregnant American woman who was murdered in Skidmore, Missouri, in December 2004. The perpetrator, Lisa Marie Montgomery, then aged 36 years old, strangled Stinnett to death and cut her unborn child (eight months into gestation) from her womb. Her motive was to produce a baby, as she had been faking a pregnancy. Montgomery was arrested in Kansas the next day and charged with kidnapping resulting in death – a federal crime due to the interstate nature of the offense. Stinnett&#x27;s baby, who had survived the crude caesarean section, was safely recovered by authorities and returned to the father.

Montgomery was tried and found guilty in 2007. She was executed by lethal injection shortly after midnight on January 13, 2021, having exhausted the appeals process. Montgomery became the first female federal inmate since 1953 to be executed by the United States federal government, and the fourth overall. At the time of her execution, she was the only female on federal death row.

== Background ==
Bobbie Jo Stinnett was born on December 4, 1981, and graduated from Nodaway-Holt High School in Graham, Missouri, in 2000. Stinnett and her husband ran a dog-breeding business from their residence in Skidmore.

Stinnett and Montgomery had met through dog show events and had ongoing interactions in an online Rat Terrier chatroom called Ratter Chatter. In these emails, Montgomery used the alias &#x27;Darlene Fischer.&quot; Montgomery told Stinnett that she was pregnant too, leading to the two women chatting online and exchanging e-mails about their pregnancies. Stinnett had a litter of puppies for sale, and Montgomery expressed interest in purchasing one. The women agreed to meet the next day.

Although Montgomery lived in Melvern, Kansas, she told Stinnett that she was from Fairfax, Missouri, a town near Skidmore. That night, Stinnett told her husband and her mother, Becky Harper, that a woman from Fairfax was going to stop by and look at the puppies.

== Murder ==
On December 16, Montgomery drove from Melvern to Skidmore and arrived at Stinnett’s home around 12:30 p.m. Montgomery carried a sharp kitchen knife and a white cord in her jacket pocket. Stinnet brought the puppies outside and played with them with Montgomery. At 2:30 p.m., Stinnett received a phone call from Harper, her mother, and confirmed that she would give Harper a ride home from work at 3:30 p.m.

Some time after the phone call ended, Montgomery attacked Stinnett and used the cord to strangle her until she was unconscious, after hanging out together at the house for approximately two hours. Montgomery then used the kitchen knife to cut into Stinnett’s abdomen, causing Stinnett to regain consciousness. A struggle ensued, and Montgomery strangled Stinnett a second time, killing her. Montgomery extracted the fetus from Stinnett’s body, cut the umbilical cord, and left with the baby. Meanwhile, after driving a short distance from Stinnett&#x27;s home, Montgomery stopped to clamp the umbilical cord and to suction any mucus from the baby’s mouth. The baby cried, but other than a cut above her eye, she was uninjured. After cleaning the baby with wipes, Montgomery retrieved the car seat she had stored in the trunk of her car and placed the baby in the seat. She then promptly drove to Topeka, Kansas.

After 3:30pm came and Stinnet didn&#x27;t return any calls, Becky walked to Stinnett&#x27;s house herself. Stinnett was discovered by her mother, Becky Harper, lying in a pool of blood, approximately an hour after the murder. Harper immediately called authorities and described the wounds inflicted upon her daughter as appearing as if her &quot;stomach had exploded.&quot; Paramedics were unsuccessful in attempts to revive Stinnett, and she was pronounced dead at St. Francis Hospital in Maryville.

Montgomery called her husband, Kevin, that same day around 5:15pm. saying that, on a Christmas shopping trip in Topeka, she had gone into labor and given birth. It was initially seen as unusual that she delivered a baby and then drove herself home right after. She said she delivered at the Birth And Womans Center in Topeka, although there were no reported births there on the day she described.

The following day, December 17, police arrested Montgomery at her farmhouse in Melvern, Kansas. A witness would later report that on the morning before her arrest, Montgomery took the infant, her husband, and two teenage sons to a restaurant for breakfast. Kathy Sage, owner of the Whistle Top Cafe in Melvern, Kansas, said she was showing the baby off as her own. She also reportedly took the child to church and said she named the child &quot;Abigal&quot; since it was from the Bible.

== Investigation ==
The investigation was aided by the issuance of an AMBER alert to enlist the public&#x27;s help. The alert was initially denied as it had not been used before in an unborn child&#x27;s case and thus there was no description of the victim. Eventually after intervention by Congressman Sam Graves, the alert was implemented.

Police had initially gone to Montgomery&#x27;s home at 32419 S Adams Rd in Melvern, Kansas after tracing online communications to her IP address, hoping to interview her as a witness. When they arrived, they found a car matching the description of the one at the crime scene. After ringing the doorbell, Kevin let the officers into the home where they found Montgomery inside, holding the infant and watching television.

Sergeant Investigator Randy Strong explained that they were investigating the murder of Bobbie Jo Stinnett. He asked about the baby, and Montgomery said that she had given birth at a women’s clinic in Topeka. She asked Kevin to retrieve the discharge papers from his truck. Kevin searched the truck, but he could not find the papers.

Strong then asked to speak to Montgomery outside the home. Montgomery allowed a law enforcement officer to hold the baby and accompanied Strong. Montgomery explained that her family was having some financial problems, so, unbeknownst to her husband, she had given birth at home, with the help of two friends. When asked the names of the friends, Montgomery responded that they had not been with her at the house but were available by phone in case she had trouble delivering the baby. Montgomery said that she had given birth in the kitchen and had disposed of the placenta in a nearby creek. At Montgomery’s request, the officers moved their questioning to the sheriff&#x27;s office. Shortly thereafter, Montgomery confessed to killing Stinnett, removing the fetus from Stinnett&#x27;s womb, and abducting the child. This all occurred within an hour timeframe. The kidnapped newborn, whom she claimed as her own, was recovered and soon placed in custody of the father.

DNA testing was used to confirm the infant&#x27;s identity, and prove that Montgomery didn&#x27;t deliver the child.

== Perpetrator ==
Lisa Marie Montgomery (February 27, 1968 – January 13, 2021) resided in Melvern, Kansas, at the time of the murder. Montgomery&#x27;s mother&#x27;s alcohol addiction led to Lisa being born with permanent brain damage. She was raised in a physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive home from the age of 11. Lisa reported rapes against her involving her stepfather Jack and several other men, were anal, oral, and vaginal. They would beat and slap her if she was “doing it wrong.” When they were done, they urinated on her. On several instances, her mother forced her to have sex with her stepfather and his friends; she was beaten if she resisted, the mother even going as far as killing the family dog in front of her as punishment. There was also a time when she ran to the police to report that she was being gang-raped; the police officers returned her to her mother who facilitated the assaults.

Her stepfather had gone so far as to construct a room off of his trailer, accessible only outside of it. He would force Lisa to live in this room, isolating her from her sisters as much as possible. In this room, Jack told Lisa that he was teaching her how to be a good wife. He would rape and sodomize her until she bled.

Starting around age 11, her mother began having servicemen come to the trailer to build a new living room. She paid for the living room by pimping Lisa out to the servicemen, calling it a &quot;family secret&quot; to her sons (Lisa&#x27;s step-brothers).

Lisa’s older half-sister, Diane Mattingly, was removed from their home and placed in foster care. Montgomery was very close to Mattingly, and was crushed when she learned she couldn&#x27;t go with her. She sought escape through alcohol. When Montgomery was 14, her mother discovered the abuse and reacted by threatening her at gunpoint.

Montgomery, in order to escape the abusive home situation, married her step-brother in August 1986. She had just turned 18. She had her first child in January of 1987, with three more following before she underwent a tubal ligation in 1990. She falsely claimed to be pregnant several times after the procedure. Montgomery claimed that she was forced to undergo the procedure by her husband/step-brother, as well as her mother.

In the years following the sterilization procedure, Montgomery claimed that she had four more pregnancies. In 1994, while separated from Bowman, Montgomery had an affair and claimed to be pregnant. Montgomery and Bowman later reconciled, and she ceased making the claim. She and Bowman divorced in 1998. In 2000, before she and Kevin (her second husband) were married, she told him that she was pregnant and intended to have an abortion. Kevin gave her forty dollars, and the pregnancy was not mentioned again. In 2002, Montgomery told her friends and family that she was pregnant again. Although she said that she was receiving prenatal care from her physician, she would not allow Kevin to attend the alleged appointments. Her physician testified that he had treated Montgomery for ankle pain and a cold, but he did not provide her any prenatal care, despite Montgomery&#x27;s claims to the contrary. When the alleged due date passed, Montgomery told Kevin that the baby had died and that she had donated its body to science.

Montgomery again claimed in the spring of 2004 that she was pregnant and due in December. This coincided with a custody battle, which also started up roughly in the same time of spring 2004. This custody battle was between her ex-husband, her step-brother, and herself. It is believed she faked this particular pregnancy to win over the judge during the court hearings.

He knew that Montgomery was unable to become pregnant and that she was again making baseless pregnancy claims. He and his new wife sent emails to Montgomery, telling her that they planned to expose her deception and use it against her in the custody proceedings. Montgomery said that she would prove them wrong. On December 10, 2004, days before the kidnapping, Bowman filed a motion for change of custody of the two minor children who lived with Montgomery.

== Trial and ruling ==
Montgomery was charged with the federal offense of &quot;kidnapping resulting in death&quot;, a crime established by the Federal Kidnapping Act of 1932, and described in Title 18 of the United States Code. Given the fact that the crime spanned two state lines (the baby was moved from Missouri to Kansas) it was brought to the federal level.

At a pre-trial hearing, a neuropsychologist testified that the head injuries Montgomery had sustained some years before could have damaged the part of the brain that controls aggression. During her trial in federal court, her defense attorneys, led by Frederick Duchardt, asserted that she had pseudocyesis, a mental condition that causes a woman to falsely believe she is pregnant and exhibit outward signs of pregnancy. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Duchardt attempted to follow this line of defense only one week before the trial began after being forced to abandon a contradictory argument that Stinnett was murdered by Montgomery&#x27;s brother Tommy, who had an alibi. As a result, Montgomery&#x27;s family refused to co-operate with Duchardt and described her background to the jury.

Dr. V. S. Ramachandran and Dr. William Logan gave expert testimony that Montgomery had pseudocyesis in addition to depression, borderline personality disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Ramachandran testified that Montgomery&#x27;s stories about her actions fluctuated because of her delusional state; thus she was unable to describe the nature and quality of her acts. Both federal prosecutor Roseann Ketchmark and the opposing expert witness forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz disagreed strongly with the diagnosis of pseudocyesis.

On October 22, 2007, jurors found Montgomery guilty, rejecting the defense claim that Montgomery was delusional. On October 26, the jury recommended the death sentence. Judge Gary A. Fenner formally sentenced Montgomery to death on April 4, 2008.

Duchardt&#x27;s pseudocyesis defense, Montgomery&#x27;s past trauma and her separate diagnosis of mental illness were not fully revealed until after her conviction. This led critics including &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist David Rose to argue that Duchardt provided an incompetent legal defense for Montgomery. Fenner required Duchardt to be cross-examined in November 2016. Duchardt rejected all criticism and defended his conduct.

== Subsequent legal proceedings ==
On March 19, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;certiorari&quot; petition. Montgomery, who was registered for the Federal Bureau of Prisons under number 11072-031, was incarcerated at Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, where she remained until she was transferred to the site of her execution. For the duration of her time there, she was the only woman on federal death row.

During her appeals, Montgomery&#x27;s lawyers argued that she technically did not commit the crime of kidnapping resulting in death, claiming that Victoria Jo Stinnett was not considered a person until she was removed from her mother&#x27;s womb. Accordingly, since Bobbi had died beforehand, the crime was instead a &quot;death resulting in kidnapping.&quot; That claim was dismissed, with the courts saying the felony murder rule nullified this and that Montgomery needed to kill Bobbi regardless in order to complete the kidnapping.

Experts who examined Montgomery after conviction concluded that by the time of her crime she had long been living with psychosis, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorders. She was said to be often disassociated from reality and to have permanent brain damage from numerous beatings at the hands of her parents and spouses. The case of &quot;Atkins v. Virginia&quot; ruled that executing individuals with intellectual disability violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution regarding cruel and unusual punishments. Given this ruling, it could be expected that Montgomery was ineligible for a death sentence. Very strong and undisputed evidence can lead to a withdrawal of the death sentence or a further enquiry into it.

== Execution ==
Nevertheless, Montgomery was scheduled for execution on December 8, 2020, by lethal injection at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, but this was delayed following her attorneys contracting COVID-19. On December 23, 2020, Montgomery was given a new execution date of January 12, 2021. U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss found that &quot;the director&#x27;s order setting a new execution date while the Court&#x27;s stay was in effect was &#x27;not in accordance with law&#x27;&quot;, prohibiting the re-scheduling of the execution before January 1, 2022.

On January 1, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated Moss&#x27;s ruling, effectively reinstating her execution date of January 12. On that date, U.S. District Judge Patrick Hanlon granted a stay of her execution on the grounds that her mental competence must first be tested as it could be argued she did not understand the grounds for her execution, per the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The stay was then vacated by the Supreme Court via a 6–3 vote. The execution was ordered to be carried out immediately. She arrived in Terre Haute&#x27;s death row on January 12.

Montgomery was eventually executed by lethal injection on January 13, 2021, at the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. When asked if she had any last words, she replied: &quot;No.&quot; She was pronounced dead at 1:31 a.m. EST.

Montgomery became the first female federal prisoner executed in 67 years, the first woman executed in the United States since Kelly Gissendaner in 2015, and the first person executed in the United States in 2021. Only three other women have been executed by the U.S. federal government: Mary Surratt, by hanging in 1865; Ethel Rosenberg by electric chair in 1953; and Bonnie Heady by gas chamber, also in 1953. Montgomery&#x27;s execution was followed a day later by Corey Johnson, and three days later by Dustin Higgs. All three were carried out by the United States federal government, each being controversial for a variety of reasons.

In her final days, Montgomery had kept a calendar marked with Joe Biden&#x27;s inauguration date. Joe Biden had promised to enact a moratorium on capital punishment at the federal level. True to his promise, Biden enacted the moratorium on July 1, 2021.

In 2023, one of Montgomery&#x27;s attorneys admitted that Montgomery&#x27;s legal team had briefly considered taking her off the medications she was on to stabilize her mental health. The intent was for Montgomery to &quot;go absolutely psychotic&quot; in her team&#x27;s attempt to postpone her execution by &quot;proving mental fragility exacerbated by sexual abuse in childhood.&quot; The attorney stated, &quot;Ultimately, we weren&#x27;t going to do that to her.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
Victoria Jo Stinnett, the daughter of Bobbie Jo Stinnett, is still alive today. After surviving the tragic events of 2004, she was raised by her father, Zebulon Stinnett, with support from extended family members, near the town of Maitland, Missouri, a mere ten-minute drive from Skidmore. The family has maintained a private life, and Victoria Jo has not spoken publicly about the incident. As of the latest available information, they continue to reside in Missouri. Members of the Nodaway-Holt High Class of 2000 have a yearly memorial donation drive for Stinnett.

Montgomery&#x27;s step-brother and first husband died on November 19, 2021, having lived in Dewey, Oklahoma at the time of his death. Kevin Montgomery is still alive and still resides in Melvern, KS.

Since the murder, Stinnett&#x27;s house at 410 W Elm Street has been left vacant. As of 2024, it is in poor condition and has been stripped of the interior walls.

== In popular culture ==
The case was described in author Diane Fanning&#x27;s &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot;, and M. William Phelps&#x27;s &quot;Murder in the Heartland&quot;. The case featured in an episode of the true crime series &quot;Deadly Women&quot; titled &quot;Fatal Obsession&quot;, in an episode of the true crime series &quot;Solved&quot; titled &quot;Life and Death&quot;, and in the fifth episode of the documentary series &quot;No One Saw a Thing&quot; that aired on the Sundance Channel on August 29, 2019. The artist Jasper Schalks made a song about the life of Lisa Montgomery titled &quot;The Ballad of Lisa Marie Montgomery&quot;.

Swedish author and playwright Lars Norén wrote a novel called &quot;En liten roman&quot; about her, released posthumously in 2024.

<doc id="1299974" wikidata="Q837070" url="?curid=1299974" title="Smiles of a Summer Night">
<text>Smiles of a Summer Night () is a 1955 Swedish comedy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. It was shown at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked it as one of the 100 greatest films since 1923.

The film&#x27;s plot—which involves some couples who switch partners on a summer night—has been adapted many times, particularly as the theatrical musical &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; by Stephen Sondheim, Hugh Wheeler and Harold Prince, which opened on Broadway in 1973, and as Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982).

== Plot ==
The film takes place in Sweden around the turn of the twentieth century. Fredrik Egerman is a middle-aged lawyer married to a 19-year-old beauty, Anne. Their two-year marriage is still unconsummated, due to Anne&#x27;s reluctance. Egerman has a son, Henrik, from his marriage to his late first wife. Henrik is in his early twenties and is studying to be a minister but is currently tormented by his love for his step-mother, who secretly loves him in return. Henrik is distracting himself from his urges by attempting an inconclusive affair with Egerman&#x27;s lusty young servant, Petra.

Between his two marriages, Fredrik had an affair with a prominent stage actress, the beautiful Desiree Armfeldt, but she broke off the relationship. Desiree now has a young son named Fredrik Armfeldt, born shortly after her affair with Fredrik Egerman. (It is implied, but never directly stated, that little Fredrik Armfeldt is the son of Egerman.) Desiree is now having an affair with an army officer, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. The Count&#x27;s wife, Charlotte, is an old friend of Egerman&#x27;s second wife Anne.

Egerman goes to see Desiree one night to pour out his marital troubles to her and ask for her help. He falls into a puddle outside Desiree&#x27;s house, and Desiree dresses him in the Count&#x27;s nightshirt. The violently jealous Count shows up and orders Egerman to leave. After Egerman goes, the Count and Desiree argue and subsequently decide to part amicably. When the Count returns home, he tells Charlotte about the encounter and orders her to tell Anne about Egerman&#x27;s supposed infidelity (though no infidelity actually occurred). When Charlotte visits Anne, she confesses that she loves the Count despite everything, and would do anything to be loved in return.

To solve these woes, Desiree has her mother invite all the characters to her country house for Midsummer Night, the shortest night of the year, a traditional observance in Sweden, when many party-goers stay awake all night until dawn. Desiree and Charlotte become temporary allies. Henrik and Anne, unexpectedly finding themselves alone together in a bedroom, consummate their relationship and elope with the assistance of Petra and her new lover Frid, another servant. Charlotte then joins Egerman in the garden pavilion. Learning his wife is with Egerman, the Count bursts in and challenges Fredrik to a game of Russian roulette. Egerman loses, but the Count had loaded the revolver with soot so neither party was ever in danger. The Count reunites with his wife, his feelings for her renewed by his jealousy. Desiree comforts Egerman, and he asks her not to leave him. The dilemmas of the four pairs of lovers appear to be happily resolved in the course of a night, said by Frid to have smiled three smiles upon them all.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Red Mill () cinema in Stockholm on 26 December 1955.

==Reception==
&quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot; opened to highly positive reviews and is viewed favorably today. The film ranked sixth on &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;″s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1956, and won the Bodil Award for Best European Film in 1957. It was nominated for a BAFTA Award in Best Film From Any Source category in 1957. It has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 1996, &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot; was included in Movieline Magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Foreign Films&quot;. The film was included in film critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot; in 2012 who gave it four stars out of four. Film critic Pauline Kael called the film &quot;a nearly perfect work&quot;, writing &quot;The film is bathed in beauty, removed from the banalities of short skirts and modern-day streets and shops, and removed in time, it draws us closer.&quot; In 2012, the film was voted at number twenty in the 25 best Swedish films of all time by a poll of 50 film critics and academics conducted by film magazine &quot;FLM&quot;.

When Stanley Cavell saw &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot;, he was so affected that he returned home and wrote about it the rest of that night. The experience led him to explore the intersection between his field, philosophy, and film.

<doc id="1299978" wikidata="Q738204" url="?curid=1299978" title="Cassin's auklet">
<text>Cassin&#x27;s auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) is a small, chunky seabird that ranges widely in the North Pacific. It is the only species placed in the genus Ptychoramphus. It nests in small burrows and because of its presence on well studied islands in British Columbia and off California it is one of the better known auks. It is named for the American ornithologist John Cassin.

Cassin&#x27;s auklet is a small (25 cm, 200 g) nondescript auk. Its plumage is generally dark above and pale below, with a small white mark above the eye. Its bill is overall dark with a pale spot, and its feet are blue. Unlike many other auks, Cassin&#x27;s auklet lacks dramatic breeding plumage, remaining the same over most of the year. At sea it is usually identified by its flight, which is described as looking like a flying tennis ball.

Cassin&#x27;s auklet ranges from midway up the Baja California peninsula to Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Islands, off North America. It nests on offshore islands, with the main population stronghold being Triangle Island off Vancouver Island&#x27;s Cape Scott, where the population is estimated to be around 55,0000 pairs. It is not known to be migratory. However, northern birds may move farther south during the winter.

Two subspecies are recognised:

*&quot;P. a. aleuticus&quot; – : Aleutian Islands &amp; south Alaska to northern Baja California.Kurile Islands.
*&quot;P. a. australis&quot; – : southern Baja California.

An extinct relative or predecessor species, &quot;Ptychoramphus tenuis&quot; L. H. Miller et Bowman, 1958, is known from the Late Pliocene of the San Diego Formation in California.

==Behaviour==
Cassin&#x27;s auklet nests in burrows on small islands, and in the southern area of its range may be found in the breeding colony year round. It either digs holes in the soil or uses natural cracks and crevices to nest in, also readily using man-made structures. Pairs will show a strong loyalty towards each other and to a nesting site for many years. Both the parents incubate the single white egg, returning to swap shifts at night (usually after 2300 h) to avoid being taken by predators such as the western gull or peregrine falcon. They also depart from the colony before dawn. The egg is incubated for 40 days, the small chick is then fed nightly for 35 days by both parents, who regurgitate partially digested food (euphausiids and other small crustaceans) carried in a special gular pouch, often referred to in the literature as a sublingual pouch. The chick fledges alone and makes its way to the sea. Cassin&#x27;s auklet is unusual amongst seabirds in occasionally laying a second clutch after a successful first clutch (it is the only northern hemisphere seabird to do so).

Most individuals in a cohort begin breeding at age 3 (27%), and by 8 years &gt;95% of a given cohort has recruited. Mean age of recruitment is 3.6 years. Minimum annual breeding propensity is 0.83, apparent local survival is 0.76, juvenile survival (ages 0 to 2) is 0.15.

At sea Cassin&#x27;s auklets feeds offshore, in clear often pelagic water, often associating with bathymetric landmarks such as underwater canyons and upwellings. Numbers at sea may be grossly underestimated because the bird moves away from ships at a distance of more than a kilometer. Recently their distribution around Triangle Island has been determined by telemetry. It feeds by diving underwater beating its wings for propulsion, hunting down large zooplankton, especially krill. It can dive to 30 m below the surface, and by some estimates 80 m.

==Conservation==
Cassin&#x27;s auklet is listed as Near Threatened, and some populations (principally the Farallon Islands population) have suffered steep declines. Threats to the auklet include introduced carnivores (particularly in Alaska), oil spills and changes in sea surface temperature (caused by El Niño events). Cassin&#x27;s auklet is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Annual variation in ocean climate synchronously affects multiple demographic parameters including survival, breeding propensity, breeding success, and recruitment, a situation conducive to rapid population declines due to climate change.

===2014 summer mass death in US===
In the last few months of 2014, the carcasses of thousands of Cassin&#x27;s auklets washed ashore from Northern California up to the north coast of Washington State. The Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team estimated a toll between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths that year. Scientists were uncertain about the cause of these deaths. While viruses, bacteria, and oil spills were ruled out the cause appeared to be starvation. Scientists found little evidence of food in the stomachs of the carcasses. Some scientists from the California&#x27;s Farallon Institute believe these mass deaths could be related to the unusual North Pacific warmth which is pushing marine food chains and could affect other species of zooplankton, krill and fish that normally develop in cold waters and the birds that consume them including Cassin&#x27;s auklets. The event happened in the late summer when the auklet chicks began to fledge.

<text>Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge is a National Wildlife Refuge in the U.S. state of Vermont located on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain and the southern side of Missisquoi Bay. The refuge is in Franklin County in the northwest corner of the state near the International Boundary with Canada.

The refuge was established on February 4, 1943, under the authority of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. The initial acquisition was 1,582 acres (6.4 km2) of land in the Missisquoi River delta, including Shad Island and Big Marsh Slough. Additional land is acquired from willing sellers. The refuge&#x27;s current size is 7,232 acres (27 km2). It was designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2013. It is the only National Wildlife Refuge located entirely in Vermont and is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is located in the towns of Swanton and Highgate with satellite units in Derby, Vermont and Westville, New York.

==Habitat management==

Refuge lands support a variety of wildlife species and habitats including floodplain forest, wetlands, shrub, bog, grasslands, and upland areas. Lands are managed to provide and protect habitat for migratory birds, to preserve the natural diversity and abundance of plants and animals, to assist with recovery of threatened and endangered species. Federal wildlife laws and regulations are enforced to ensure the protection of habitat and wildlife.

Maquam Bog is a located on the northeastern margin of Lake Champlain, Vermont. It contains Vermont&#x27;s largest populations of pitch pine, rhodora, and chain fern, a state-threatened species. The bog serves as an important wintering area for white-tailed deer and provides feeding and breeding areas for a variety of birds.

Parcels of early successional hardwoods are rotationally clear cut in 8 - 10 year intervals in an effort to provide a variety of age class hardwood habitat for woodcock. Small clearcuts, usually 100 feet wide, are used on the refuge to create feeding, nesting and brood-rearing covers. Permanently mowed pieces of land adjacent to the clearcuts provide singing grounds and roosting areas for American woodcock. Woodcock, like ruffed grouse, turkey, white-tailed deer and a variety of songbirds all require forest habitat that is disturbed periodically to stimulate regeneration of dense hardwood stands that support declining woodcock populations throughout the east.

Grasslands are periodically hayed, mowed or burned to keep open field from changing back to forest. Many wildlife species benefit from these open field habitats. Waterfowl, bobolinks, and many other songbirds, pollinators and small mammals use open fields to nest and rear young. Birds of prey such as kestrel, northern harriers and rough-legged hawks glide over these same grasslands in search of prey such as mice, voles and other small mammals.

In addition to of natural marsh, the refuge includes of managed wetlands formed by three impoundments. Water levels in these areas are manipulated to encourage the growth of waterfowl food and cover plants such as wild rice and buttonbush, while also exposing hummocks of soil and vegetation that support nesting by mallards, American black ducks and other wetland birds.

==Fauna==
The largest great blue heron rookery in Vermont has been on the refuge&#x27;s Shad Island. This rookery fluctuates from about 250 to almost 600 nests each year. This rookery has been reduced in since 2015, due to an increasing bald eagle population. More than 20,000 ducks converge on the refuge each fall and find habitat for feeding and resting. In the spring, a small percentage of those use the refuge habitats for nesting. All of Vermont&#x27;s endangered black terns nest on the refuge. A significant percentage of Vermont&#x27;s nesting ospreys are found on the refuge. Spiny softshell turtles, a state threatened species, use the refuge to feed and bask from April through September. Mammals that inhabit this refuge include raccoon, black bear, coyote, skunk, beaver, red fox, river otter, bobcat, porcupine, muskrat, and mink.

<text>Tracy Michelle Byrd (born August 27, 1964, Flint, Michigan) is an American female boxer. She was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==
Byrd comes from a boxing family: her father, Joe Byrd, is a former boxer who trained her.

Her brother Antoine once lost to Roy Jones Jr. in a bid to win the world&#x27;s Middleweight title, and her other brother, Chris, is a former heavyweight title holder.

Tracy Byrd enjoyed athletics since she was a young child. She excelled in high school as a basketball player. Her brothers Antoine and Chris, however, inspired her into trying out boxing, so she began to attend the Byrd boxing gym, owned by her father.

==Professional career==
On her first professional fight, August 6, 1996, the then 32-year-old boxer beat Sue Chase by a decision in four rounds in Flint. Her first three fights were held in Flint, and she earned first round knockouts in professional fights number two and three.

Her fourth fight, a rematch with Chase on January 28, 1997, took place just outside Flint, in Detroit. Byrd again outpointed Chase over four rounds.

After beating Dee Dufoe by decision in six in what turned out to be her first fight held outside Michigan (the fight was held in Indio, California), Byrd was given the opportunity to challenge for a world championship for the first time: On August 2, 1997, she defeated defending champion Nora Daigle to become the IFBA world Lightweight champion, in Biloxi, Mississippi.

Byrd retained the title on October 24 with a fourth-round knockout of Bethanny Payne in New Jersey. After this fight, and since Byrd continued undefeated in nine fights, Byrd was given some attention by boxing magazines such as The Ring and KO. But, on her second defense, held on June 30, 1998, she lost her title, and her undefeated mark, to Russian Zulfia Koutdoussova, who, as a consequence, inherited the media attention that Byrd was receiving.

Byrd rebounded with three consecutive decision wins, and she was given a second chance at becoming a world champion, when she met Laura Serrano of Mexico on September 2, 1999. She lost by a ten-round decision in Tunica, Mississippi, for the WIBF&#x27;s world Lightweight title.

Byrd then took off two years from boxing, deciding to lose weight and return as a Junior Lightweight in 2001. Initially, she had success fighting at a lower weight class, conquering the vacant IFBA intercontinental title with a ten-round unanimous decision over Brenda Vickers on May 19, at Ignacio, Colorado.

Her next fight was for the IFBA world Featherweight title, on July 7. She lost that world championship bid, being outpointed over ten rounds by Layla McCarter. This was the beginning of a five fight losing streak for Byrd. All those fights were lost by decision, and they included two more losses to McCarter, another loss to Koutdoussova, and a defeat at the hands of Isra Girgrah.

Despite losing five times in a row, she was given yet another world title chance, when, on March 22, 2003, she faced Agnieszka Rylik for the WIBO world Jr. Welterweight title. Byrd became a world champion for the second time, when she defeated Rylik by a ten-round split decision in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Her next, and so far last, fight, took place on June 28 of that year, when she and Puerto Rico&#x27;s Belinda Laracuente drew (tied) in an eight rounds non-title bout held at Coconut Grove, Florida.

Byrd has a record of thirteen wins, seven losses and one draw, with four wins by knockout, she has not been knocked out as a professional.

<doc id="1299991" wikidata="Q665178" url="?curid=1299991" title="Roman siege engines">
<text>Roman [[siege engine]]s were, for the most part, adapted from Hellenistic siege technology. Relatively small efforts were made to develop the technology; however, the Romans brought an unrelentingly aggressive style to siege warfare that brought them repeated success. Up to the first century BC, the Romans utilized siege weapons only as required and relied for the most part on ladders, towers and rams to assault a fortified town. Ballistae were also employed, but held no permanent place within a legion&#x27;s roster, until later in the republic, and were used sparingly.
Julius Caesar took great interest in the integration of advanced siege engines, organizing their use for optimal battlefield efficiency.

== Army engineering corps ==


To facilitate this organization and the army&#x27;s self-sufficiency, an engineering corps was developed. An officer of engineers, or &quot;praefectus fabrum&quot;, is referenced in armies of the late Republic, but this post is not verifiable in all accounts and may have simply been a military advisor on the personal staff of a commanding officer. There were legion architects (whose rank is yet unknown) who were responsible for the construction of war machines who would also assure that all artillery constructions in the field were level. Ensuring that constructions were level was the job of the &quot;libratores&quot;, who would also launch missiles and other projectiles (on occasion) during battle (Le Bohec 1994: 52). The engineering corps was in charge of massive production, frequently prefabricating artillery and siege equipment to facilitate its transportation.

== Artillery ==

Roman artillery was very efficient at that time, and during a siege the Romans would attack the weakest area of their enemy&#x27;s defenses and attempt to breach the walls at that point. To support this effort, artillery attacks commence, with three main objectives: to cause damage to defenses, casualties among the opposing army, and loss of enemy morale. It would also provide cover fire for troops building siege ramps or those in siege towers. There were machines called &quot; tormenta &quot;, which would launch (sometimes incendiary) projectiles such as javelins, arrows, rocks, or beams. These devices were on wheeled platforms to follow the line&#x27;s advance. All were &quot;predicated on a principle of physics: a lever was inserted into a skein of twisted horsehair to increase torsion, and when the arm was released, a considerable amount of energy was thus freed&quot;. It was later stated that sinew, instead of twisted hair, provided a better “spring.” These weapons were high-maintenance devices and vulnerable to having their leather, sinew, or hemp skeins affected by wet or even damp, which would cause them to slacken and lose tension, rendering the engine useless.

It is somewhat difficult to clearly define and describe Roman artillery, as names are easily confused and historians still do not agree on all definitions. Perhaps best known are the &quot;ballista&quot;, the &quot;onager&quot;, and the &quot;scorpio&quot;.

===&quot;Ballista&quot;===


After the absorption of the ancient Greek city states into the Roman Republic in 146 BC, some advanced Greek technologies began to spread across many areas of Roman influence. This included the hugely advantageous military advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.

The Romans &#x27;inherited&#x27; the torsion powered &quot;ballistae&quot; which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war in time, including one from Pergamum, which was depicted among a pile of &#x27;trophy&#x27; weapons in relief on a balustrade.

The torsion &quot;ballista&quot;, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor, and the Romans developed it even further.

Vitruvius, in his &quot;De Architectura&quot; book X, describes the construction and tuning of &quot;ballistae&quot;.

Every century (group of 60-100 men) in the Roman army had a &quot;ballista&quot; by the 1st century AD. It was the command of the chief of the &quot;ballistae&quot;, under whom were the artillery experts, or &quot;doctores ballistarum&quot; and finally, the artillerymen, or &quot;ballistarii&quot;. &quot;Ballistae&quot; were heavy missile weapons, hurling large rocks great distances to damage rampart walls. They resembled large crossbows, rather than catapults. They were powered by two horizontal like arms, which were inserted into two vertical and tightly wound &quot;skein&quot; springs contained in a rectangular frame structure making up the head or principal part of the weapon. The arms were drawn rearward with a winch lever to further twist the skeins and thus gain the torsion power to cast a projectile. It has been said that the whirring sound of a &quot;ballista&quot; projected stone struck fear and dread into the hearts of those inside the walls of besieged cities. The stones chosen to be used in the &quot;ballista&quot; had to be a particular sort. According to Vegetius, river stones were best, since they are round, smooth, and dense. &quot;Ballista&quot; stones found at the site of Masada were chiseled to make them as round as possible.

====Early Roman &quot;ballistae&quot;====


The early Roman &quot;ballistae &quot;were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the bolts or stone &#x27;shot&#x27;. Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of winches and a claw, used to ratchet the bowstring back to the armed firing position. A slider passed through the field frames of the weapon, in which were located the torsion springs (rope made of animal sinew), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn were attached to the bowstring.

Drawing the bowstring back with the winches twisted the already taut springs, storing the energy to fire the projectiles.

The &quot;ballista&quot; was a highly accurate weapon (there are many accounts right from its early history of single soldiers being picked off by the operators), but some design aspects meant it could compromise its accuracy for range. The lightweight bolts could not gain the high momentum of the stones over the same distance as those thrown by the later onagers, trebuchets, or mangonels; these could be as heavy as .

The Romans continued the development of the &quot;ballista&quot;, and it became a highly prized and valued weapon in the army of the Roman Empire.

It was used, just before the start of the empire, by Julius Caesar during his conquest of Gaul and on both of his expeditions to Britain. Both attempted invasions of Britain and the siege of Alesia are recorded in his own &quot;commentarii&quot; (journal), &quot;The Gallic Wars &quot;(&quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;).

====First invasion of Britain====

The first invasion of Britain took place in 55 BC, after a rapid and successful initial conquest of Gaul, in part as an exploratory expedition, and more practically to try to put an end to the re-enforcements sent by the native Britons to fight the Romans in Gaul.

A total of eighty transports, carrying two legions, attempted to land on the British shore, only to be driven back by the many British warriors assembled along the shoreline. The ships had to unload their troops on the beach, as it was the only one suitable for many kilometers, yet the massed ranks of British charioteers and javeliners were making it impossible.

Seeing this, Caesar ordered the warships – which were swifter and easier to handle than the transports, and likely to impress the natives more by their unfamiliar appearance – to be removed a short distance from the others, and then be rowed hard and run ashore on the enemy’s right flank, from which position the slings, bows and artillery could be used by men on deck to drive them back. This manoeuvre was highly successful. Scared by the strange shape of the warships, the motion of the oars, and the unfamiliar machines, the natives halted and then retreated a little. (Caesar, &quot;The Conquest of Gaul&quot;, p. 99)

====Siege of Alesia====

In Gaul, the stronghold of Alesia was under a Roman siege in 52 BC, and surrounded by Roman fortifications. As was standard siege technique at the time, &quot;ballistae&quot; were placed up in the towers with other soldiers armed with either bows or slings.

===Onager===


The &quot;onager&quot; was a post-classical Roman siege engine, which derived its name from the kicking action of the machine, similar to that of an onager (wild ass). It is a type of catapult that uses torsional pressure, generally from twisted rope, to store energy for the shot.

The onager consisted of a frame placed on the ground to whose front end a vertical frame of solid timber was rigidly fixed; through the vertical frame ran an axle, which had a single stout spoke. On the extremity of the spoke was a sling used to launch a projectile.

In action the spoke was forced down, against the tension of twisted ropes or other springs, by a windlass, and then suddenly released. The spoke thus kicked the crosspiece of the vertical frame, and the projectile at its extreme end was shot forward.

The onagers of the Roman Empire were mainly used for besieging forts or settlements. They would often be loaded with large stones or rocks that could be covered with a flammable substance and set alight.

In the Middle Ages (recorded from around 1200 A.D.) a less powerful version of the onager was used that employed a fixed bowl rather than a sling, so that many small projectiles could be thrown, as opposed to a single large one. This engine was sometimes called the &quot;mangonel&quot;, although the same name may have been used for a variety of siege engines.

===Scorpio===


The &quot;scorpio&quot; was a crossbow-like device that shot smaller arrows with deadly accuracy used both in the field and in sieges. They were so-named for their deadly, armor-piercing sting and could be operated by just one or two men. Scorpios were meant to kill and injure enemy troops, rather than break down enemy fortifications. Thanks to their smaller size, they could be mounted on or in siege towers. During the Siege of Amida, a scorpio arrow killed the son of Grumbates, king of the Chionitae, when he was approaching the city to surrender.

There has been some research done into the existence of the self-loading, serial repeating &quot;scorpio&quot; or polybolos. Legionaries on either side would continuously keep turning cranks which turned a chain, which operated the various mechanisms to load and shoot the catapult. All that was needed was for another soldier to keep feeding in more arrows.

== Breaking the walls ==

===Battering ram===


Roman battering rams, or &quot;aries&quot;, were an effective weapon for breaking down an enemy&#x27;s walls, as well as their morale. Under Roman law, any defenders who failed to surrender before the first ram touched their wall were denied any rights. The moment they heard the ram hit the wall, those inside the city knew that the siege proper had begun and there was no turning back.

Josephus describes the battering ram used at Jotapata thus:

It is an immense beam, similar to a ship’s mast, with one end covered with iron shaped into a ram’s head; hence its name. It is suspended from another beam like a balance arm by cables around its middle, and this in turn is supported at both ends by posts fixed in the ground. It is drawn back by a huge number of men who then push it forward in unison with all their might so that it hits the wall with its iron head. There is no tower strong enough nor any wall thick enough to withstand repeated blows of this kind, and many cannot resist the first shock.

Vitruvius in &quot;De Architectura &quot;Book X describes the construction and use of battering rams.

For protection, a battering ram was suspended in a mobile shelter called a tortoise, or &quot;testudo&quot;. According to Vegetius, it was given this name because the ram would swing out of the shelter much like a tortoise&#x27;s head comes out of its shell. Such shelters would provide the men within protection against missiles and incendiary devices. They were constructed from a framework of strong timbers with planks and wicker hurdles on the sides. The entire shelter would then be covered with a fireproof material such as uncured hides. According to Apollodorus of Damascus, the shelter should be fixed to the ground while the ram was being used to both prevent skidding and strain on the axles from the weight of the moving apparatus. This would also increase the strength of the impact on the walls.

===Siege tower===

According to Josephus, the Roman siege towers at Jotapata were high and iron-plated to protect them from fire; those at Masada were reported to be high. It was possible to have many different devices on siege towers, such as artillery, draw bridges and rams. Those at the top of the tower were to keep defenders off the walls while those below them attempted to breach the wall using ramps. In the battle of Jerusalem in 70 AD the Romans began assault on the third defensive wall within Jerusalem, the tower stood tall and was compromised when the Jewish resistance tunneled underneath the tower leading it to collapse. Following a basic design, details of tower construction varied from siege to siege and there is no known treatise which specifies at which level siege equipment should be placed. Vegetius noted that, “besiegers sometimes built a tower with another turret inside it that could suddenly be raised by ropes and pulleys to over-top the wall”.

===Mine===

Mines could be dug under city walls as a means of entering a city secretly and capturing it but were more frequently constructed to weaken city walls. Once dug, sappers would underpin the walls with wood and cause the walls to collapse by firing the supports with resin, sulfur and other incendiary materials.

=== Corvus ===

In chapter 1.22 &quot;The Victory of Mylae&quot; of his &quot;History,&quot; Polybius writes:Now their ships were badly fitted out and not easy to manage, and so some one suggested to them as likely to serve their turn in a fight the construction of what were afterwards called &quot;crows&quot;. Corvus means &quot;crow&quot; or &quot;raven&quot; in Latin and was the name given to a Roman boarding device first documented during the First Punic War against Carthage. Polybius goes on to describe this siege engine as a bridge used to span the distance between two ships in battle. The device was a plank, 4 ft wide and 36 ft long, affixed to the Roman vessel around a pole. This construction allowed the bridge to be swung port to starboard and therefore used on either side of the ship. A pulley at the top of the pole allowed the planks to be raised and lowered on command. At the end of the bridge there was a heavy metal spike that when dropped on the deck of an enemy ship would, with the aid of gravity, become imbedded in the deck. By connecting the two ships in such a way, Roman soldiers could gain access to the deck of the enemy ship and engage in hand-to-hand combat instead of depending on ship-to-ship combat. Polybius also includes an insight on how these siege engines would have practically functioned in battle: And as soon as the &quot;crows&quot; were fixed in the planks of the decks and grappled the ships together, if the ships were alongside of each other, the men leaped on board anywhere along the side, but if they were prow to prow, they used the &quot;crow&quot; itself for boarding, and advanced over it two abreast. The first two protected their front by holding up before them their shields, while those who came after them secured their sides by placing the rims of their shields upon the top of the railing. Such were the preparations which they made; and having completed them they watched an opportunity of engaging at sea.Based on this historical description the Corvus used some mechanisms seen in the more complex siege towers or the sheds constructed around battering rams. They protected, to an extent, the Roman soldiers as they gained entry to the enemy&#x27;s space where they could engage in combat.

<text>Raymonde Testanière, known as Vuissane, was a servant in the Comté de Foix in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. She is known to us through her testimony recorded on the Fournier Register and examined in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s &quot;Montaillou&quot;. Vuissane was a servant in the Belot household from 1304 to 1307. She was also a mistress to Bernard Belot and had two children with him. Vuissane reported to have hoped to marry Bernard, but he was only interested in a wife from a wealthier family and eventually married Guillemette Benet. He also rejected Vuissane as she did not believe in Albigensianism.

Unlike most of the household, Vuissane was not a believer in Albigensianism. Her mother, Alazaïs Testanière, was a staunch Catholic and kept her daughter away from Catharism. The Belots were Cathars and for a time Vuissane looked favourably upon the heresies but this ended when a leading heretic Arnaud Vital, who was living as a boarder in the Belot household, tried to rape her.

After leaving the employ of the Belot household she married Bernard Testanière.

<text>A Search and Intervention Brigade ( (BRI) (), Investigation and Intervention Brigade or Anti-Gang Brigade) is a unit of the French National Police. The first units were formed in 1964 and carried out their tasks under the command of the Paris prefecture.

BRIs are specialized in serious criminal cases such as armed robbery and kidnappings. They typically attempt to catch offenders in the act after monitoring their activities, a technique that was first experimented with in the 1960s by the then-new Paris BRI. They use a mix of traditional techniques and modern technology to collect and archive data about banditry. Although most of the pictures illustrating this article show uniformed officers (of the Paris BRI-PP) during a hostage-rescue public demonstration, most BRI missions are undertaken by plain clothed officers. There are now more than 15 BRI units, located in France&#x27;s major cities. The first of them, the Paris BRI (or BRI-PP for &quot;Préfecture de Police&quot;), was created in 1964.

In 1972, in the wake of the Munich massacre, it was decided that BRI-PP would, as an additional task, form the nucleus of a police tactical task force known as &quot;Brigade Anticommando&quot; (Counter-commando Brigade) or BRI-BAC. BRI-BAC, when activated, is reinforced by other specialised units of the Préfecture de police. It has been involved in the resolution of hostage crises from its beginnings in the early 1970s to the Porte de Vincennes siege in January 2015 and the &quot;Bataclan&quot; assault during the November 2015 Paris attacks. In the &quot;Porte de Vincennes&quot; case, BRI-BAC and the National Police&#x27;s RAID operated together as part of the National Police Intervention Force ().

==History==

The first BRI, BRI-PP was created in Paris in 1964. François le Mouël, a police commissary with the Paris Police Prefecture (PP), suggested that there were situations when, instead of waiting until a crime had been committed to start an inquiry, the police could achieve better results by keeping a close watch on known or suspected criminals and/or some of their potential targets. The criminals would then be arrested - either just before the crime took place or soon after but never during the action itself - so that there would be enough evidence for prosecution while avoiding the risks of shoot-outs and innocent victims. Initially set up as a new section in one of the PP&#x27;s Directorate of Judiciary Police brigades, BRI became a separate brigade in 1967, still under le Mouël&#x27;s leadership.

The Paris BRI method was innovative enough so that it was widely copied all around France and in other European countries. One of the better-known BRI successes was achieved in 1977 when the captors of banker Gérard Mallet, who had been under surveillance for more than four months, were arrested less than four hours after they had committed their crime.

==Missions==
* All BRI units - including Paris BRI-PP : Judiciary police work with an emphasis on flagrante delicto cases. All BRIs can set up special response teams in case of a terrorist attack.
* Paris BRI (BRI-PP) when activated as BRI-BAC (): crisis response in hostage and terrorism cases. When activated, &quot;brigade anticommando&quot;, becomes one of three French national response teams, together with the Police nationale&#x27;s RAID, and the Gendarmerie nationale&#x27;s GIGN

==Organization ==
The BRIs are regular law enforcement units of the French National Police, which has jurisdiction over the whole French territory. The only exceptions are the Paris and Bouches-du-Rhône Prefectures of Police, which, because they are major cities and - in the case of Paris - the nation&#x27;s capital, have autonomous police authority governing bodies directly subordinated to the French Minister of the Interior.

Unlike RAID which is a special response team directly subordinated to the Director general of the National police, BRIs are parts of the French criminal police. Their main mission is the arrest of violent criminals. As members of the judiciary police, BRI officers normally operate in plain clothes for most missions. Hoods are used to ensure anonymity during some of these missions.

Command and coordination between the Paris BRI-PP and RAID in response to acts of terror, is entrusted to a task force called National Police Intervention Force, headed by the RAID commander, and which is only activated if a major crisis occurs.

As of 2018 there are the Paris BRI, two national and several regional BRI units, independent from one another:
* Paris Police Prefecture
** Direction Régionale de Police Judiciaire de Paris
*** &quot;Brigade de recherche et d&#x27;intervention - Préfecture de police&quot; (BRI-PP) - the Paris unit. It is the first BRI unit and as such the precursor of the other units. It becomes &quot;Brigade Anticommando&quot; (BRI-BAC) in case of a security crisis. 
* Central Directorate of the Judicial Police
** National BRIs
*** &quot;Brigade de recherche et d&#x27;intervention&quot; - &quot;Nationale&quot; (BRI-NAT) - based in Nanterre (near Paris) in support of inquiries conducted at the national level.
*** &quot;Brigade de recherche et d&#x27;investigation - Financières nationales&quot; (BRI-FN) - attached to the financial crime directorate of the National Police
** Interregional Directorate of the Judicial Police Lyon (&quot;DIPJ Lyon&quot;) - BRI Lyon
** Interregional Directorate of the Judicial Police Marseille (&quot;DIPJ Marseille&quot;) - BRI Marseille

** Interregional Directorate of the Judicial Police Rennes (&quot;DIPJ Rennes&quot;)
*** Nantes Branch of the Interregional Directorate of the Judicial Police Rennes (&quot;DIPJ Rennes – antenne PJ Nantes&quot;) - BRI Nantes
*** Regional Service of the Judicial Police Rouen (&quot;DIPJ Rennes – SRPJ Rouen&quot;) - BRI Rouen
** Interregional Directorate of the Judicial Police Lille (&quot;DIPJ Lille&quot;) - BRI Lille

** Interregional Directorate of the Judicial Police Bordeaux (&quot;DIPJ Bordeaux&quot;) - BRI Bordeaux (with a branch team in Bayonne)
*** Regional Service of the Judicial Police Toulouse (&quot;DIPJ Bordeaux – SRPJ Toulouse&quot;) - BRI Toulouse
** Regional Service of the Judicial Police Ajaccio (&quot;DRPJ Ajaccio&quot;) - BRI Ajaccio (with a branch team in Bastia)
** Interregional Directorate of the Judicial Police Orléans (&quot;DIPJ Orléans&quot;) - BRI Orléans

<doc id="1300004" wikidata="Q4497217" url="?curid=1300004" title="Bruce Henderson">
<text>Bruce Doolin Henderson (April 30, 1915 – July 20, 1992) was an American businessman and management expert. He founded Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in 1963 in Boston, Massachusetts and headed the firm as the president and CEO until 1980. He continued as chairman of BCG until 1985.

==Early life==

Henderson was born on a farm in Nashville, Tennessee on April 30, 1915. In the fourth grade, he enrolled in the Peabody Demonstration School (PDS) and remained there until his high school graduation in 1932. 

During high school, Henderson played on the football team.

==Personal life==
Henderson married twice. With his first wife, Frances, he fathered four children. He had two daughters—Asta Werme and Ceacy Griffin—and two sons—Bruce Alexander Henderson and Bruce Balfour Henderson. His second wife was Bess, with whom he had no children. Henderson had seven grandchildren at the time of his death.

==Career==
Henderson began his career as a salesman in the Southwestern Advantage entrepreneurial program. He went on to attend and earn an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Vanderbilt University in 1937, before attending Harvard Business School. He left Harvard only ninety days before graduation to work for the Westinghouse Corporation. Henderson worked there for 18 years. He became the vice president at the age of 37, making him one of the youngest vice presidents in the company&#x27;s history.

In 1959, Henderson left the company to join the consulting firm Arthur D. Little as a senior vice president for management services. He left the firm in 1963 over disagreements with the firm&#x27;s leadership.

==Boston Consulting Group==
Upon leaving Arthur D. Little, Henderson accepted a challenge from the CEO of Boston Company to create a consulting arm for the bank, operating as a subsidiary under the name Management and Consulting Division of the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. This consulting arm began its operations in 1963. Initially, it advised clients of the bank. Billings for the first month were only US$500. Nevertheless, Henderson hired his second consultant, Arthur P. Contas, in December 1963.

Henderson provided a very specific imprint to the firm, that of &quot;strategy consultants&quot;. Robert Mainer gave an account of how that choice was made:[Henderson] asked what we thought [BCG&#x27;s] specialty should be. Many suggestions were offered, but in each case, we were able to identify several other firms that already had strong credentials in that particular area. The discussion began to stall. Then Bruce asked a momentous question: &#x27;What about business strategy?&#x27; I objected: &#x27;That&#x27;s too vague. Most executives won&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re talking about.&#x27; Bruce replied, &#x27;That&#x27;s the beauty of it. We&#x27;ll define it&#x27;.—Robert E. Mainer, Boston 1964-1967

Bruce created the publication entitled &quot;Perspectives&quot; as a new form of marketing and in response to the &quot;McKinsey Quarterly&quot; and Arthur D. Little&#x27;s &quot;Prism&quot;. He wrote extensively for the publication until 1980.

In 1974 Henderson made BCG an independent business and was one of the first to take advantage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that allowed the establishment of an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). The ESOP began the process of buying BCG from The Boston Company, the parent corporation of Boston Safe Deposit. The buyout was completed in 1979, five years ahead of schedule.

Between 1974 and 1980, Henderson focused on growing the firm and expanding its international presence. By the end of 1977, revenues were split evenly among business originating in the United States and overseas.

==Retirement==
Henderson stepped down from his role as the president and CEO of Boston Consulting Group in 1980. He was succeeded by Alan Zakon. By that time, he had grown BCG from a one-man-shop to a global firm with seven offices and 249 consultants. He continued as the chairman until 1985. He retired and went to Nashville, Tennessee, to teach at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University.

==Death==
Henderson died at the age of 77, ten days after suffering a stroke at his home in Nashville in 1992. He was survived by his second wife, four children with his first wife, and seven grandchildren.

A memorial service was held with an overflow of attendees at the Memorial Church at Harvard Yard, Cambridge, on December 11, 1992, amidst a blizzard. Speakers at the service included John S. Clarkson, then-president and chief executive officer of BCG, George Stalk, a senior vice president of BCG, and Alan Zakon, former BCG chairman.

==Ideas and concepts==

===The experience curve===
&quot;The strategic implications of the experience curve came closer to shattering earth.&quot;—The Economist, 2009

The Experience Curve is a managerial tool primarily used to predict cost behaviour. It states that &quot;costs characteristically decline by 20-30% in real terms each time accumulated experience doubles. This means that when inflation is factored out, costs should always decline. The decline is fast if growth is fast and slow if growth is slow.&quot;

The Experience Curve partially relies upon the concept of the learning curve, yet expands upon it in de-linking it from labor-driven repetitive tasks.

As a managerial tool, the experience curve is still in use in the 2010s; for example, by Petrobras in oil field development.

===The growth-share matrix===
The growth-share matrix—or BCG Matrix, as it came to be known—is a managerial tool used to visually represent a company&#x27;s portfolio. It is a two-by-two matrix, which divides the dimensions of relative market share (x-axis) and market growth (y-axis) into four quadrants. Individual business are represented with circles having an area proportional to the size of the business itself.

The growth-share matrix evolved as a collaborative effort of BCG employees in the period between 1968 and 1970. The theory underpinning it was laid out in the BCG perspective &quot;The Product Portfolio&quot; in 1970.

One unusual characteristic of this visualization is that the x-axis is generally represented on an inverted scale (greater values are on the left), and on a logarithmic scale. The logarithmic scale may have been carried over from the work done on the Experience Curve (which uses a log-log scale), and is not always consistently used as such. In many cases, the scale used is linear, not logarithmic. According to Aldershof, the inverted scale is merely accidental. During an early development session, Dr. Zakon sketched the two-by-two matrix on a chalkboard, and labeled the sections as High and Low from top to bottom, and High and Low from left to right, simply for convenience. The format persisted through later development sessions, without anyone considering that in the future the axis might become calibrated— where a low-to-high scale from left to right would be more typical and easier to produce.

===Brinkmanship in business===
&quot;The goal of the hottest economic war, is an agreement for coexistence, not annihilation.&quot;—Bruce D. Henderson, 1976.

Henderson said the article could equally be titled &quot;How to Succeed in Business by Being Unreasonable&quot;. He wrote that to compete effectively, it was necessary to appear to be co-operating while in fact ensuring to get one&#x27;s own way. He compared business to international relations during peacetime, when countries compete ferociously but exercise restraint to avoid war.

===Business and biology===
&quot;Competition existed long before strategy. It began with life itself.&quot;—Bruce D. Henderson, 1989

By the early 1980s, the lessons of the experience curve led Henderson to shift his thinking beyond the bankruptcy of mainstream economics. He began to imagine a new and far more powerful kind of economics. The realization that organizations are not static machines but complex, dynamic systems that learn from experience led him to begin seeing companies as living, growing organisms. Following this logic, Henderson began to argue that the competition in the economy&#x27;s market niches was remarkably like competition in nature&#x27;s ecologic niches.

The article &quot;The Origin of Strategy&quot; (1989) in this area was the last article he published.

==Personality and style==

=== Favorite quotes ===
An engineer by training, Henderson never tired of quoting Archimedes to aspiring staff: &quot;&quot;Give me a lever and a place to stand, and I will move the world&quot;.—Carl W. Stern, 2006

He was fond of quoting Jay Forrester: &quot;While most people understand first-order effects, few deal well with second-and third-order effects. Unfortunately, virtually everything interesting in business lies in fourth-order effects and beyond&quot;&quot;—Carl W. Stern, 2006

==Awards and recognition==

In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Henderson to a team of five analysts who evaluated foreign aid programs in Germany under the Marshall Plan.

Henderson was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 10 newsmakers under 30 years old.

In 1978 Henderson was inducted by Vanderbilt&#x27;s School of Engineering as a Distinguished Alumnus.

Henderson received the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1985 by the University School of Nashville, from which he had graduated in 1932.

Upon his death, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; stated that Henderson &quot;did more to change the way business is done in the United States than any other man in American business history&quot;.

The Bruce D. Henderson Chair in Strategy was endowed by Bruce&#x27;s wife Bess after his death at the Owen Graduate School of Management of Vanderbilt University.

The Boston Consulting Group Bruce D. Henderson Chair in International Management was endowed by BCG in 1995 at INSEAD. It is currently held by W. Chan Kim.

The Bruce D. Henderson Scholarship was endowed in 1985 by the Boston Consulting Group to honor Henderson and awarded to the MBA student at the Owen School of Management of Vanderbilt University, who, during the first year, achieved the strongest record in personal, professional, and academic performance.

The Boston Consulting Group launched the BCG Henderson Institute in honor of Henderson on his hundredth birthday. In January 2018, the BCG Henderson Institute was ranked the third Best For Profit Global Think Tank by the University of Pennsylvania. The institute operates hubs in Europe and Asia and is headquartered in New York.

<doc id="1300011" wikidata="Q911690" url="?curid=1300011" title="Stoma (medicine)">
<text>In anatomy, a stoma (: stomata or stomas) is any opening in the body. For example, a mouth, a nose, and an anus are natural stomata. Any hollow organ can be manipulated into an artificial stoma as necessary. This includes the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon, pleural cavity, ureters, urinary bladder, and renal pelvis. Such a stoma may be permanent or temporary.

Surgical procedures that involve the creation of an artificial stoma have names that typically end with the suffix &quot;-ostomy&quot;, and the same names are also often used to refer to the stoma thus created. For example, the word &quot;colostomy&quot; often refers either to an artificial anus or the procedure that creates one. Accordingly, it is not unusual for a stoma to be called an ostomy (plural ostomies), as is the norm in wound, ostomy, and continence nursing.

==Gastrointestinal stomata==


Stomata are created in particular in surgical procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) or gastrointestinal system (GIS). The GIT begins at the mouth or oral cavity and continues until its termination, which is the anus. Examples of gastrointestinal stomata include:
* Esophagostomy
* Gastrostomy (also see percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy)
* Cholecystostomy
* Choledochostomy
* Enteric:
** Cecostomy
** Colostomy
** Duodenostomy
** Ileostomy
** Jejunostomy
** Appendicostomy (see also continence appendicostomy)

One well-known form of an artificial stoma is a colostomy, which is a surgically created opening in the large intestine that allows the removal of feces out of the body, bypassing the rectum, to drain into a pouch or other collection device. This surgical procedure is invoked usually as a result of and solution to disease in the GIT. The procedure involves bisecting this tube, usually between the later stage of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine or colon, hence colostomy, and exiting it from the body in the abdominal region. The point of exiting is what is known as the stoma.

For greatest success and to minimize negative effects, it is preferable to perform this procedure as low down in the tract as possible, as this allows the maximal amount of natural digestion to occur before eliminating fecal matter from the body. The stoma is usually covered with a removable pouching system (adhesive or mechanical) that collects and contains the output for later disposal. Modern pouching systems enable most individuals to resume normal activities and lifestyles after surgery, often with no outward physical evidence of the stoma or its pouching system.

When planning the position of the stoma, a stoma nurse should bear in mind the height of the person&#x27;s waist and beltline so that clothes can fit as before. Also a peri-stomal hernia belt worn from the start can help prevent the stoma from developing a serious hernia problem.

==Other examples of stomata==

* Dacryocystorhinostomy
* Sclerotomy
* Tracheostomy
* Urostomy (also see Ileal conduit urinary diversion)
** Nephrostomy
** Ureterostomy
** Vesicostomy (cystostomy)
The historical practice of trepanation was also a type of stoma.

<doc id="1300017" wikidata="Q2881890" url="?curid=1300017" title="Banania">
<text>Banania is a popular chocolate drink found most widely distributed in France. It is made from cocoa, banana flour, cereals, honey and sugar. There are two types of Banania available in French supermarkets: &#x27;traditional&#x27; which must be cooked with milk for 10 minutes, and &#x27;instant&#x27; which can be prepared in similar fashion to Nesquik.

==History==
During a visit near Lake Managua, Nicaragua in 1909, the journalist Pierre Lardet was informed of a recipe for a cocoa-based drink. When he returned to Paris, he started its commercial fabrication and, in 1912, began marketing Banania with the picture of an Antillaise.

At the outset of World War I, the popularity of the colonial troops at the time led to the replacement of the West Indian in 1915, by the now more familiar jolly Senegalese infantry man enjoying Banania. Pierre Lardet took it upon himself to distribute the product to the Army, using the line &quot;pour nos soldats la nourriture abondante qui se conserve sous le moindre volume possible&quot; (&quot;for our soldiers: abundant nourishment that stores while taking up the least space possible&quot;).

The brand&#x27;s yellow background underlines the banana ingredient, and the Senegalese infantryman&#x27;s red and blue uniform make up the other two main colours. The slogan &quot;Y&#x27;a bon&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s good&quot;) derives from the pidgin French supposedly used by these soldiers (it is, in fact, an invention).

The form of the character has since evolved to more of a cartoon character. However, the original advertising has become a cultural icon in France. Posters and reproduction tin-plate signs of the pre-war advertising continue to be sold.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, Banania sponsored the Yellow Jersey of the Tour de France. In France the Banania brand is now owned by the newly founded French company Nutrial, which acquired it from Unilever in 2003.

== Marketing ==
This brand of chocolate drink is recognized by its trademark the &#x27;bonhomme Banania&#x27;: a black man wearing a fez. The company started using this illustration in 1915.

==Controversy==

Some feel that the advertising slogans and images are racist and colonialist as it reinforces the cliché of a friendly yet stupid African. Some French black people connect this stereotype with aggressive colonialist policy in Africa of the global group Unilever, the former owner of the brand. The Martiniquan psychiatrist and philosopher Frantz Fanon, in his 1952 book &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot;, mentions the grinning Senegalese tirailleur as an example of how in a burgeoning consumer culture, the black subject appears not only as an object, but as &quot;an object in the midst of other objects&quot;.

<text>Thomas Granger or Graunger (1625? – September 8, 1642) was one of the 32 people hanged in the Plymouth Colony (the first hanged in Plymouth or in any of the colonies of New England being John Billington) and the first known juvenile to be sentenced to death and executed in the territory of today&#x27;s United States. He was a servant to Love Brewster, of Duxbury, in the Plymouth Colony of British North America. Graunger, at the age of 16 or 17, was convicted of &quot;buggery with a mare, a cow, two goats, divers sheep, two calves, and a turkey&quot;, according to court records of September 7, 1642.

Graunger reportedly confessed to his crimes in court privately to local magistrates, and upon indictment, publicly to ministers and the jury, being sentenced to &quot;death by hanging until he was dead&quot;. He was hanged by John Holmes, Messenger of the Court, on September 8, 1642. Before Graunger&#x27;s execution, following the laws set down in Leviticus 20:15 (&quot;And if a man shall lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast&quot;), the animals involved were slaughtered before his face and thrown into a large pit dug for their disposal, no use being made of any part of them.

An account of Granger&#x27;s acts is recorded in Gov. William Bradford&#x27;s diary &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation 1620–1647.&quot; Granger&#x27;s crime represents the colonies&#x27; first recorded act of bestiality.
