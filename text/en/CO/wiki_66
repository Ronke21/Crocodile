<text>A medical guideline (also called a clinical guideline, standard treatment guideline, or clinical practice guideline) is a document with the aim of guiding decisions and criteria regarding diagnosis, management, and treatment in specific areas of healthcare. Such documents have been in use for thousands of years during the entire history of medicine. However, in contrast to previous approaches, which were often based on tradition or authority, modern medical guidelines are based on an examination of current evidence within the paradigm of evidence-based medicine. They usually include summarized consensus statements on best practice in healthcare. A healthcare provider is obliged to know the medical guidelines of their profession, and has to decide whether to follow the recommendations of a guideline for an individual treatment.

==Background==

Modern clinical guidelines identify, summarize and evaluate the highest quality evidence and most current data about prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy including dosage of medications, risk/benefit and cost-effectiveness. Then they define the most important questions related to clinical practice and identify all possible decision options and their outcomes. Some guidelines contain decision or computation algorithms to be followed. Thus, they integrate the identified decision points and respective courses of action with the clinical judgement and experience of practitioners. Many guidelines place the treatment alternatives into classes to help providers in deciding which treatment to use.

Additional objectives of clinical guidelines are to standardize medical care, to raise quality of care, to reduce several kinds of risk (to the patient, to the healthcare provider, to medical insurers and health plans) and to achieve the best balance between cost and medical parameters such as effectiveness, specificity, sensitivity, resoluteness, etc. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that the use of guidelines by healthcare providers such as hospitals is an effective way of achieving the objectives listed above, although they are not the only ones.

==Publication==
Guidelines are usually produced at national or international levels by medical associations or governmental bodies, such as the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Local healthcare providers may produce their own set of guidelines or adapt them from existing top-level guidelines. Healthcare payers such as insurers practicing utilization management also publish guidelines.

Special computer software packages known as guideline execution engines have been developed to facilitate the use of medical guidelines in concert with an electronic medical record system. 
The Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF) is a computer representation format for clinical guidelines that can be used with such engines.

The US and other countries maintain medical guideline . In the US, the National Guideline Clearinghouse maintains a catalog of high-quality guidelines published by various health and medical associations. In the United Kingdom, clinical practice guidelines are published primarily by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). In The Netherlands, two bodies—the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) and College of General Practitioners (NHG)—have published specialist and primary care guidelines, respectively. In Germany, the German Agency for Quality in Medicine (ÄZQ) coordinates a national program for disease management guidelines. All these organisations are now members of the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), an international network of organisations and individuals involved in clinical practice guidelines.

==Compliance==
Checklists have been used in medical practice to attempt to ensure that clinical practice guidelines are followed. An example is the Surgical Safety Checklist developed for the World Health Organization by Dr. Atul Gawande. According to a meta-analysis after introduction of the checklist mortality dropped by 23% and all complications by 40%, but further high-quality studies are required to make the meta-analysis more robust. In the UK, a study on the implementation of a checklist for provision of medical care to elderly patients admitting to hospital found that the checklist highlighted limitations with frailty assessment in acute care and motivated teams to review routine practices, but that work is needed to understand whether and how checklists can be embedded in complex multidisciplinary care.

==Problems==
Guidelines may lose their clinical relevance as they age and newer research emerges. Even 20% of strong recommendations, especially when based on opinion rather than trials, from practice guidelines may be retracted.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2004 that some simple clinical practice guidelines are not routinely followed to the extent they might be. It has been found that providing a nurse or other medical assistant with a checklist of recommended procedures can result in the attending physician being reminded in a timely manner regarding procedures that might have been overlooked.

Guidelines may have both methodological problems and conflict of interest. As such, the quality of guidelines may vary substantially, especially for guidelines that are published on-line and have not had to follow methodological reporting standards often required by reputable clearinghouses. Patients and caregivers are frequently excluded from clinical guidelines development, in part because there is a lack of guidance for how to include them in the process.

Guidelines may make recommendations that are stronger than the supporting evidence.

In response to many of these problems with traditional guidelines, the BMJ created a new series of trustworthy guidelines focused on the most pressing medical issues called &quot;BMJ&quot; Rapid Recommendations.

<text>Ieuan ap Hywel Swrdwal (?1430 – ?1480) was a Welsh poet, from Norman stock. He composed primarily in Welsh, but was also responsible for the first known poem in the English language written by a Welshman. His father Hywel Swrdwal was also a poet, and there are doubts as to whether a number of extant works should be attributed to the father or to the son. He is reputed to have composed a history of Wales, but this has not survived.

The &quot;Hymn to the Virgin&quot; was written by Ieuan at Oxford in about 1470 and uses a Welsh poetic form, the &quot;awdl&quot;, and Welsh orthography; for example:
The poem consists of 96 lines in 13 stanzas. It is an address to Christ through the Virgin Mary.

An alternative claim for the first poem in English written by a Welshman is made for John Clanvowe&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Cupid, God of Love&quot; or &quot;The Cuckoo and the Nightingale&quot;, a long love poem based on &quot;The Owl and the Nightingale&quot;.

<text>Silesians (; Silesian German: &quot;Schläsinger&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;Schläsier&quot;; ; ; ) is both an ethnic as well as a geographical term for the inhabitants of Silesia, a historical region in Central Europe divided by the current national boundaries of Poland, Germany, and Czechia. Historically, the region of Silesia (Lower and Upper) has been inhabited by Polish (West Slavic Lechitic people), Czechs, and by Germans. Therefore, the term Silesian can refer to anyone of these ethnic groups. However, in 1945, great demographic changes occurred in the region as a result of the Potsdam Agreement leaving most of the region ethnically Polish and/or Slavic Upper Silesian. The Silesian language is one of the regional languages used in Poland alongside Polish as well as Kashubian and is structured with in a SVO format, however the grammar is quite often different to that of the other Lechitic languages. The names of Silesia in different languages most likely share their etymology—; ; ; ; ; ; ; Latin, Spanish and English: &quot;Silesia&quot;; ; ; ; ; . The names all relate to the name of a river (now Ślęza) and mountain (Mount Ślęża) in mid-southern Silesia, which served as a place of cult for pagans before Christianization.

&quot;Ślęża&quot; is listed as one of the numerous Pre-Indo-European topographic names in the region (see old European hydronymy). According to some Polonists, the name &quot;Ślęża&quot; or &quot;Ślęż&quot; is directly related to the Old Polish words &quot;ślęg&quot; or &quot;śląg&quot; , which means dampness, moisture, or humidity. They disagree with the hypothesis of an origin for the name &quot;Śląsk&quot; from the name of the Silings tribe, an etymology preferred by some German authors.

The term &quot;Silesia&quot; is a Latinized word of the original Polish/Lechitic name &quot;Śląsk&quot; inhabited by the ancient Lechitic tribes called Ślężanie. 
In Silesia, there are many places of the ancient Slavic Lechitic pagan cult of these ancient people, for example Góra Ślęża.

About 209,000 of the Upper Silesian population declared themselves as pure Silesians, 376,000 people declared themselves as having a joint Silesian and Polish nationality while only 471,000 people declared themselves to be of only Polish nationality from Silesia in the 2011 Polish national census making them the largest minority group in Poland. About 126,000 people declared themselves as members of the German minority (58,000 declared it jointly with Polish nationality), making it the third largest minority group in the country (93% of Germans living in Poland are in the Polish parts of Silesia). 31,301 people declared Silesian nationality in the Czech National Census of 2021, including 18,850 of those who declared two nationalities (44,446 in Czechoslovakia in 1991), and 6,361 people declared joint Silesian and Moravian nationality in the Slovak national census. Over 85% of the population in the Polish part of Upper Silesia declare themselves as Poles, and in the Czech part as Czechs.

During the German occupation of Poland, Nazi authorities conducted a census in East Upper Silesia in 1940. At the time, 157,057 people declared Silesian nationality (&quot;Slonzaken Volk&quot;), and the Silesian language was declared by 288,445 people. However, the Silesian nationality could only be declared in the Cieszyn part of the region. Approximately 400–500,000 respondents from the other areas of East Upper Silesia who declared &quot;Upper Silesian nationality&quot; (Oberschlesier) were assigned to the German nationality category. After World War II in Poland, the 1945 census showed a sizable group of people in Upper Silesia who declared Silesian nationality. According to police reports, 22% of people in Zabrze considered themselves to be Silesians, and that number was around 50% in Strzelce County.

==History==
Archaeological findings of the 20th century in Silesia confirm the existence of an early settlement inhabited by Celtic tribes.

Until the 2nd century some parts of Silesia were populated by Celtic Boii, predecessors of the states of Bohemia and Bavaria and subsequently until the 5th century, by the Germanic Silingi, a tribe of the Vandals, which moved south and west to invade Andalusia. Silesia remained depopulated until the second phase of the migration period.

The Slavs, predominantly White Croats entered the depopulated territory of Silesia in the first half of the 6th century. The Slavic territories were mostly abandoned, because the Celtic and Germanic tribes that lived there before had moved west. Chronologically, the first group of Slavs were those that dwelt by the Dnieper River, the second was the Sukov-Dzidzice type Slavs, and the last were groups of Avaro-Slavic peoples from the Danube river areas. In the early 9th century, the settlement stabilized. Local West Slavs began to erect a series of defensive systems, such as the Silesian Przesieka and the Silesia Walls to guard them from invaders. The north-eastern border with Western Polans was not reinforced, due to their common culture and language.

The 9th-century &quot;Bavarian Geographer&quot; records the tribal names of the Opolanie, Dadosesani, Golenzizi, Lupiglaa, and the Ślężanie. The 1086 &quot;Prague Document&quot;, which is believed to document the 10th-century settlements, also mentions the Bobrzanie and Trzebowianie tribes. Later sources classified those tribes as Silesian tribes, which were also jointly classified as part of Polish tribes. The reason for this classification was the &quot;fundamentally common culture and language&quot; of Silesian, Polan, Masovian, Vistulan, and Pomeranian tribes that &quot;were considerably more closely related to one another than were the Germanic tribes.&quot;

According to &quot;Perspectives on Ethnicity&quot;, written by anthropologist V. I. Kozlov and edited by R. Holloman, the Silesian tribes, together with other Polish tribes, formed what is now Polish ethnicity and culture. This process is called ethnic consolidation, in which several ethnic communities of the same origin and cognate languages merge into one.

===Middle Ages===
The Silesians lived on the territory that became part of the Great Moravia in 875. Later, in 990, the first Polish state was created by Duke Mieszko I, and then expanded by king Boleslaw I at the beginning of the 11th century. He established the Bishopric of Wrocław in Lower Silesia in the year 1000.

In the Middle Ages, Slavic tribal confederacies, and then Slavic states, dominated. Silesia was part of Great Moravia, then Kingdom of Bohemia and finally the Piast monarchy of Poland. The tribal differences started to disappear after the consolidation of Poland in the 10th and 11th centuries. The main factors of this process were the establishment of a single monarchy that ruled over all Polish tribes, as well as creation of a separate ecclesiastical organization within the boundaries of the newly established Polish state. The names of the smaller tribes disappeared from historical records, as well as the names of some prominent tribes. However, in some places, the names of the most important tribes transformed into names representing the whole region, such as Mazovians for Mazovia, and Silesians for Silesia. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, some of those regions were again divided into smaller entities, such as the division of Silesia into Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia). However, the tribal era was already over, and these divisions reflected only political subdivisions of the Polish realm. Within Poland, from 1177 onward, Silesia was divided into many smaller duchies. In 1178, parts of the Duchy of Kraków around Bytom, Oświęcim, Chrzanów and Siewierz were transferred to the Silesian Piasts, although their population was of Vistulan and not of Silesian descent. Parts of those territories were bought by the Polish kings in the second half of the 15th century, but the Bytom area remained in the possession of the Silesian Piasts, even though it remained a part of the Diocese of Kraków. Between 1327 and 1348, the duchies of Silesia came under the suzerainty of the Crown of Bohemia, which was then passed to the Habsburg monarchy of Austria in 1526.

Beginning in the 13th century, Slavic Silesia began to be settled by Germans from various parts of Germany, including Prussia and Austria. This led to changes in the ethnic structure of the province. In the Middle Ages, various German dialects of the new settlers became widely used throughout Lower Silesia and some Upper Silesian cities. However, after the era of German colonization, the Polish language was still predominant in Upper Silesia and parts of Lower and Middle Silesia north of the Odra river. Germans usually dominated large cities, and Poles mostly lived in rural areas. This required the Prussian authorities to issue official documents in Polish, or in German and Polish. The Polish-speaking territories of Lower and Middle Silesia, commonly called the &quot;Polish side&quot; until the end of the 19th century, were mostly Germanized in the 18th and 19th centuries, except for some areas along the northeastern frontier.

===Modern history===
In 1742, most of Silesia was seized in the War of the Austrian Succession by King Frederick the Great of Prussia, who named himself a &#x27;Piast prince&#x27; (he was actually a remote descendant) in his first declaration. The remainder of Silesia, known as Cieszyn Silesia, remained in the Austrian Empire. The Prussian part of Silesia constituted the Province of Silesia until 1918. Later, the province was split into the Prussian provinces of Upper and Lower Silesia. Owing to the development of education, a rebirth of Polish culture took place in the second half of the 1800s in Silesia, which was connected with the emergence of a Polish national movement of a clearly Catholic character. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the fact that Silesians were part of the Polish nation was not questioned. The language and culture of the self-declared Polish Silesians were put under the pressure of the Prussian Kulturkampf policies, which attempted to Germanize them in culture and language. The process of Germanisation was never completely successful. The cultural distance of Upper Silesians from the German population resulted in the development of Polish national awareness at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, culminating in the pro-Polish movements at the end of World War I.

After the Silesian Uprisings, the eastern minor, but richer, part of Upper Silesia became part of the newly restored Poland; most of the land that had been ruled by the Habsburgs following the 1742 war went to Czechoslovakia, while Lower Silesia and most of Upper Silesia remained in Germany. The ethnic situation of the region became more complex as the division of Upper Silesia into Polish and German parts led to ethnic polarization. The people that lived in the western part of Upper Silesia were subject to a strong German Ostsiedlung, where those living in the eastern part of Silesia started to identify with the Polish culture and statehood.

World War II and its aftermath amplified this polarization. Three groups took shape within the Silesian population. The Polish-speaking group was the largest, while the German-speaking group, which primarily lived in central Silesia, was noticeably smaller. A third group supported separatism and an independent Silesian nation-state. The separatists were of marginal importance, finding little support among native Silesians.

The reasons for these transitions were boundary shifts and population changes that came after World War II. As a result, the vast majority of the former German Silesia, even Lower Silesia, which did not have sizeable Polish-speaking population, was incorporated into Poland, with smaller regions remaining under the control of the German Democratic Republic (which later became a part of unified Germany). Czechoslovakia obtained most of Cieszyn Silesia. Millions of Silesians, mostly of German ethnicity, were subsequently forcibly expelled, but after being sifted out from the ethnic Germans by a process of &quot;national verification&quot;, the Silesians classified as &quot;autochthons&quot; by the Polish communist authorities were allowed to remain, and they were intensely &quot;polonized&quot;.

Between 1955 and 1959, under the supervision of the Red Cross, some of the remaining Silesians were able to emigrate to West and East Germany to reunite with their families there. But some had to wait for years. Until 1989, nearly 600,000 Silesians emigrated to Germany.

Between 1945 and 1949, millions of ethnic Poles from the former (pre-1939) eastern Poland (especially Lviv, Volhynia, Podolia, Vilnius, etc.) and central Poland moved into Silesia, particularly in Lower Silesia. Since the end of Communist rule in Poland, there have been calls for greater political representation for the Silesian ethnic minority. In 1997, a Katowice court of law registered the Union of People of Silesian Nationality (ZLNS) as the political representative organization of the Silesian ethnic minority, but after two months, the registration was revoked by a regional court.

According to M.E. Sharpe, Silesians inhabiting Poland are considered to belong to a Polish ethnographic group, and they speak a dialect of Polish. United States Immigration Commission also counted Silesian as one of the dialects of Polish. As a result of German influence, Silesians have been influenced by German culture. Many German and their descendants who inhabited both Lower and Upper Silesia have been displaced to Germany in 1945-47.

==Language==

The Slavic Silesian language (often called Upper Silesian) is spoken by the Silesian ethnic group or nationality inside Polish Upper Silesia. According to the last census in Poland (2011), some 509,000 people declared Silesian to be their native language; however, as many as 817,000 people declared themselves to be of Silesian nationality, not necessarily speaking Silesian, even though the Silesian nationality has not been recognized by Polish governments since its creation in 1945.

There is some contention over whether Silesian is a dialect or a language in its own right. Most Polish linguists consider Silesian to be a prominent regional dialect of Polish. However, many Silesians regard it to be a separate language belonging to the West Slavic branch of Slavic languages, together with Polish and other Lechitic languages, such as Upper and Lower Sorbian, Czech and Slovak. In July 2007, the Silesian language was officially recognized by the Library of Congress and SIL International. The language was attributed an ISO code: &quot;SZL&quot;. The first official dictation contest of the Silesian language took place in August 2007.

Although the German language is still spoken in Silesia, as it has a sizable minority of speakers in the Opole Voivodship in Poland, the vast majority of native speakers were expelled during or after 1945. Therefore, the number of German speakers in the region was radically and significantly decreased after World War II, even though the Germans had settled there for centuries. The Silesian German dialect is a distinct variety of East Central German, with some West Slavic influence likely caused by centuries of contact between Germans and Slavs in the region; the dialect is related to contemporary Saxon in some ways. The Silesian German dialect is often misleading referred to as Lower Silesian in the German language. The usage of this dialect appears to be decreasing, as most Silesian Germans prefer either Standard German or even Polish.

== Historical data ==
===Prussian Lower Silesia===
In year 1819, the Breslau Regency had 833,253 inhabitants, the majority of whom—755,553 (90%)—were German-speakers; with a Polish-speaking minority numbering 66,500 (8%); as well as 3,900 Czechs (1%) and 7,300 Jews (1%). The Liegnitz Regency was inhabited by Germans with a small Sorbian minority.

===Prussian Upper Silesia===
The earliest exact census figures on ethnolinguistic or national structure (Nationalverschiedenheit) of the Prussian part of Upper Silesia, come from year 1819. The last pre-WW1 general census figures available, are from 1910 (if not including the 1911 census of school children—Sprachzählung unter den Schulkindern—which revealed a higher percent of Polish-speakers among school children than the 1910 census among the general populace). Figures (Table 1.) show that large demographic changes took place between 1819 and 1910, with the region&#x27;s total population quadrupling, the percent of German-speakers increasing significantly, and that of Polish-speakers declining considerably. Also the total land area in which Polish language was spoken, as well as the land area in which it was spoken by the majority, declined between 1790 and 1890. Polish authors before 1918 estimated the number of Poles in Prussian Upper Silesia as slightly higher than according to official German censuses.

===Plebiscite in Prussian Upper Silesia===

In the 1921 plebiscite, 40.6% of eligible voters (people over 20 years old – a minimum age that favoured the German-speaking population, whose median age was greater than that of Polish-speakers of Upper Silesia, according to censuses of 1900–1910) decided to secede from Germany and become Polish citizens. In total, over seven hundred towns and villages voted in favour of Poland, especially in the counties of Pszczyna, Rybnik, Tarnowskie Góry, Toszek-Gliwice, Strzelce Opolskie, Bytom, Katowice, Lubliniec, Zabrze, Racibórz, Olesno, Koźle and Opole.

<text>Planet (also known as Planet: The Welsh Internationalist) is a quarterly cultural and political magazine published in Aberystwyth, Wales. It looks at Wales from an international perspective, and at the world from the standpoint of Wales. The magazine enjoys a vibrant and diverse international readership, and is read by key figures in the Welsh political cultural scene.

==History==

&quot;Planet&quot; publishes high-quality writing, artwork and photography by established and emerging figures, and covers subjects across politics, the arts, literature, current events, social justice questions, minority language and culture, the environment and more. It was originally set up as a bi-monthly publication by Ned Thomas in 1970, and was published continually until 1979. This followed a decision in 1967 to devolve the function of The Arts Council of Great Britain in Wales to the Welsh Arts Council. Thomas explained that &quot;The arts council&#x27;s literature director, Meic Stephens, had a vision of creating a publishing base in Wales that hadn&#x27;t existed before&quot;. The magazine was renamed &quot;Planet: The Welsh Internationalist&quot; in 1977.

On the eve of the 1979 Welsh devolution referendum, predicting a &quot;no&quot; vote, Thomas decided to bring the magazine to an end as he believed &quot;that a no vote would mean that &quot;Planet&#x27;s&quot; stance and ideology had failed, and a yes vote would mean that Wales needed a magazine published more often than once every two months&quot;. He was persuaded to relaunch the magazine in 1985, and with improved funding, John Barnie was employed as a full-time assistant before becoming editor in 1990. Barnie was succeeded by his wife Helle Michelsen, in 2006, and in 2010 by Jasmine Donahaye. In 2012, Emily Trahair became the current editor, with Dafydd Prys ap Morus as production editor and Helen Pendry as assistant editor. With Helen and Dafydd departing, Lowri Angharad Pearson joined in 2015 as Administrative and Marketing Assistant and Hywel Edwards in 2017 as Production Officer. The team also puts together the &quot;Planet Extra&quot; website.

In 2002, funding was moved from the Arts Council to the Welsh Books Council, and in 2009, the Welsh Books Council changed their magazine&#x27;s funding remit to a quarterly. The first expanded quarterly issue was published in April of that year. The magazine celebrated its 40th anniversary with its 200th issue in November 2010.

Originally published in Llangeitho, the magazine&#x27;s headquarters later moved to the publishing heartland of Aberystwyth. &quot;Planet&quot; also publishes a book imprint.

<doc id="1294755" wikidata="Q1731741" url="?curid=1294755" title="Use of Sarum">
<text>The Use of Sarum (or Use of Salisbury, also known as the Sarum Rite) is the liturgical use of the Latin rites developed at Salisbury Cathedral and used from the late eleventh century until the English Reformation. It is largely identical to the Roman Rite, with about ten per cent of its material drawn from other sources. The cathedral&#x27;s liturgy was widely respected during the late Middle Ages, and churches throughout the British Isles and parts of northwestern Europe adapted its customs for celebrations of the Eucharist and canonical hours. The Sarum Rite has a unique ecumenical position in influencing and being authorized for liturgical use by the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the Anglican Communion.

==Origins==

In 1078, William of Normandy appointed Osmund, a Norman nobleman, as bishop of Salisbury (the period name of the site whose ruins are now known as Old Sarum). As bishop, Osmund initiated some revisions to the extant Celtic-Anglo-Saxon rite and the local adaptations of the Roman rite, drawing on both Norman and Anglo-Saxon traditions.

Nineteenth-century liturgists theorized that the liturgical practices of Rouen in northern France inspired the Sarum liturgical books. The Normans had deposed most of the Anglo-Saxon episcopate, replacing them with Norman bishops, of which Osmund was one. Given the similarities between the liturgy in Rouen and that of Sarum, it appears the Normans imported their French liturgical books as well.

The Use of Sarum refers not only to the text and rubrics of the Mass, but also the calendar of saints, feasts and fast days, the readings and other liturgical practices. For example, on Maundy Thursday individuals who had been excommunicated for serious sins and then confessed were publicly received back into communion in the &quot;Reconciliation of the Penitents&quot; ceremony.

==Dissemination==
The revisions during Osmund&#x27;s episcopate resulted in the compilation of a new missal, breviary, and other liturgical manuals, which came to be used throughout southern England, Wales, and parts of Ireland.

Some dioceses issued their own missals, inspired by the Sarum rite, but with their own particular prayers and ceremonies. Some of these are so different that they have been identified as effectively distinct liturgies, such as those of Hereford, York, Bangor, and Aberdeen. Other missals (such as those of Lincoln Cathedral or Westminster Abbey) were more evidently based on the Sarum rite and varied only in details.

Liturgical historians believe the Sarum rite had a distinct influence upon other usages of the Roman rite outside England, such as the Nidaros rite in Norway and the Braga Rite in Portugal. Following the siege of Lisbon in 1147, Gilbert of Hastings became the first bishop of the restored bishopric of Lisbon, and introduced the Sarum rite for the liturgy of the mass in his diocese, a use which continued until 1536, when the Cardinal-Infante Afonso of Portugal introduced the Roman rite as a response against the Anglican Schism. It has even been speculated that through Portuguese missionaries the Sarum Use might have even been used in the Congo.

==Sarum Mass ritual==

Masses according to the Use of Sarum were similar to the Tridentine Mass, both being adaptations of the Roman Rite from different periods with an almost identical Roman Canon, but with even more parts, lavishness and busy rubrics: there are eighty sequences for Sarum-use Masses but only five for Tridentine-use Masses. It had a high Mass and a Low Mass.

The high Mass of Sundays and great feasts involved up to four sacred ministers: priest, deacon, subdeacon, and acolyte. It was customary for them to visit in procession all the altars of the church and cense them, ending at the great rood screen (or whatever barrier between the laity and the altar), where antiphons and collects would be sung. At the screen would be read the Bidding Prayers, prayers in the vernacular directing the people to pray for various intentions.

There was considerable variation from diocese to diocese, or even church to church, in the details of the rubrics: the place where the Epistle was sung, for instance, varied enormously; from a lectern at the altar, from a lectern in the quire, to the feature described as the &#x27;pulpitum&#x27;, a word used ambiguously for the place of reading (a pulpit) or for the rood screen. Some scholars thought that the readings were proclaimed from the top of the rood screen, which was most unlikely given the tiny access doors to the rood loft in most churches. This would not have permitted dignified access for a vested Gospel procession.

The procession then vested for Mass. Sarum had a well-developed series of colours of vestments for different feasts. There may have been tendencies to use a particular colour for a particular feast (red, for instance, was used on Sundays, as in the Ambrosian rite), but if a church were simply too poor to have several sets of vestments, they used what they had. 

Some of the prayers of the Mass are unique, such as the priest&#x27;s preparation prayers for Holy Communion. Some ceremonies differ from the Tridentine Mass, though they are not unknown in other forms of the western rites: the offering of the bread and wine was (as in the Dominican and other rites) made by one act. These distinctions have been evaluated as &quot;of the most trifling character.&quot; The chalice was prepared between the readings of the Epistle and the Gospel. In addition, in common with many monastic rites, after the Elevation the celebrant stood with his arms outstretched in the form of a cross; the Particle was put into the chalice after the Agnus Dei. It is probable that communion under one kind was followed by a &#x27;rinse&#x27; of unconsecrated wine. The first chapter of St John&#x27;s Gospel was read while the priest made his way back to the sacristy. Two candles on the altar were customary, though others were placed around it and on the rood screen. The Sarum missal calls for a low bow as an act of reverence, rather than the genuflection.

Notably, there are no prayers or rubrics in the extant texts that show how lay communion was performed.

==Modern period==
===English Reformation===
Even after the Church of England was established separate from the Catholic Church, the Canterbury Convocation declared in 1543 that the Sarum Breviary would be used for the canonical hours. Under Edward VI of England, the use provided the foundational material for the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and remains influential in English liturgies. Mary I restored the Use of Sarum in 1553, but it fell out of use under Elizabeth I. New priests arriving from Douai were trained in the new Tridentine Use (of the &quot;Missale Romanum&quot;), so the Use of Sarum, and its fasting requirements, waned by the end of the century.

Sarum Use remains a permitted use for Roman Catholics, as Pope Pius V permitted the continuation of uses more than two hundred years old under the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Quo primum&quot;. In practice, a brief resurgence of interest in the 19th century did not lead to a revival.

Some Western Rite Orthodox congregations have adopted the use due to its antiquity and similarities with the Byzantine Rite. This includes Western Rite members of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, as well as the Old Calendarist Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles.

In spite of interest in the Sarum Use, its publication in Latin sources from the sixteenth century and earlier has inhibited its modern adoption. Several academic projects are gradually improving its accessibility. From 2009 to 2013, Bangor University produced a series of films and other resources as part of &quot;The Experience of Worship&quot; research project. In 2006, McMaster University launched an ongoing project to create an edition and English translation of the complete Sarum Use with its original plainsong, resulting in the publication of over 10,000 musical works, and expected to be completed in 2022.
===Influence on Anglo-Catholic Anglican liturgy===
The ritual of Sarum Use has influenced even churches that do not use its text, obscuring understanding of the original:

Many of the ornaments and ceremonial practices associated with the Sarum rite—though not the full liturgy itself—were revived in the Anglican Communion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as part of the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement in the Church of England. Some Anglo-Catholics wanted to find a traditional formal liturgy that was characteristically &quot;English&quot; rather than &quot;Roman.&quot; They took advantage of the &#x27;Ornaments Rubric&#x27; of 1559, which directed that English churches were to use &quot;...such Ornaments of the Church, and of the Ministers thereof, at all Times of their Ministration, shall be retained, and be in use, as were in this Church of England, by the Authority of Parliament, in the Second Year of the Reign of Edward VI of England,&quot; i.e. January 1548 - January 1549, before the First Prayer Book came into effect in June of the latter year (which authorized the use of traditional vestments and was quite explicit that the priest shall wear an alb, vestment (chasuble) or cope and that the deacons shall be vested in albs and tunicles (dalmatics). However, there was a tendency to read back Victorian centralizing tendencies into mediaeval texts, and so a rather rubrical spirit was applied to liturgical discoveries.

Chief among the proponents of Sarum customs was the Anglican priest Percy Dearmer, who put these into practice (according to his own interpretation) at his parish of St Mary the Virgin, Primrose Hill, in London. He explained them at length in &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Handbook,&quot; which ran through several editions. This style of worship has been retained in some present-day Anglican churches and monastic institutions, where it is known as &quot;English Use&quot; (Dearmer&#x27;s term) or &quot;Prayer Book Catholicism&quot;.

===Modern influence on Catholic liturgies===

The Collect for Purity is found in the modern &quot;Divine Service&quot; missal (which documents the Anglican Use of the Roman rite for use in the personal ordinariate churches set up for Anglicans and Methodists transferring to Roman Catholicism.) The prayer has a long history, being found in the Use of Sarum and several pre-cursor liturgies since from the 10th century, but it was adopted into its current position by Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer and thence into Methodist liturgies.

<doc id="1294756" wikidata="Q458643" url="?curid=1294756" title="Severinus of Noricum">
<text>Severinus of Noricum ( 410 – 8 January 482) is a saint, known as the &quot;Apostle to Noricum&quot;. It has been speculated that he was born in either Southern Italy or in the Roman province of Africa. Severinus himself refused to discuss his personal history before his appearance along the Danube in Noricum, after the death of Attila in 453. However, he did mention experiences with eastern desert monasticism, and his &quot;vita&quot; draws connections between Severinus and Saint Anthony of Lerins.

Saint Severinus of Noricum is not to be confused with Severinus of Septempeda, bishop of San Severino Marche and brother of Saint Victorinus of Camerino.

According to Thompson, the saint had been a public figure of the utmost importance and held the consulship himself in 461.

== Life ==
Little is known of his origins. The source for information about him is the &quot;Commemoratorium vitae s. Severini&quot; (511) by Eugippius. 

Severinus was a high-born Roman living as an anchorite in the East. He himself was an ascetic in practice. He is first recorded as traveling along the Danube in Noricum and Bavaria, preaching Christianity, procuring supplies for the starving, redeeming captives and establishing monasteries at Passau and Favianae, At the age of eight, the orphaned Anthony of Lerins was entrusted to the care of Severinus and brought up at the monastery. Upon the death of Severinus in 482, he was sent to Germany and put in the care of his uncle, Constantius, an early Bishop of Lorsch.

While the Western Empire was falling apart, Severinus, thanks to his virtues and organizational skills, committed himself to the religious and material care of the frontier peoples, also taking care of their military defense. He organized refugee camps, migrations to safer areas, and food distribution.

His efforts seem to have won him wide respect, including that of the Germanic chieftain Odoacer. Eugippius credits him with the prediction that Odoacer would become king of Rome. However, Severinus warned that Odoacer would rule not more than fourteen years. According to Eugippius, Gibuld of the Alamanni used to harry Passau, until he was asked by Severinus to free his Roman hostages. Gibuld was so impressed by the Christian abbot that he agreed to free seventy of his prisoners.

Severinus also supposedly prophesied the destruction of Asturis (perhaps ), Austria, by the Huns. When the people would not heed his warning, he took refuge in Comagena.

He established refugee centers for people displaced by the invasion, and founded monasteries to re-establish spirituality and preserve learning in the stricken region.

He died in his monastic cell at Favianae while singing Psalm 150. Six years after his death, his monks were driven from their abbey, and his body was taken to Italy, where it was at first kept in the Castel dell&#x27;Ovo, Naples, then eventually entombed at the Benedictine monastery rededicated to him, the Abbey of San Severino in the city of Naples. 

Severinus is the patron saint of Austria, and of Bavaria.

== Accounts of his life ==
Paul the Deacon, in his 8th-century &quot;History of the Lombards,&quot; mentions the monastery founded by Severinus at Eiferingen, at the foot of the Kahlenberg, not far from Vienna:

The &quot;Vita&quot; of Severinus was written by Eugippius. Beyond Eugippius&#x27; work, the only other contemporary source that mentions Saint Severinus is the &quot;Vita beati Antonii&quot; by Magnus Felix Ennodius, bishop of Pavia.

In the &quot;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Edward Gibbon notes that the disciples of Saint Severinus were invited by a Neapolitan lady to bring his body to the villa in 488, &quot;in the place of Augustulus, who was probably no more&quot;. It is based on the passage in the &quot;Vita&quot; by Eugippius where it is said that the estate was called &quot;castellum Lucullanum&quot;. The estate was converted into a monastery before 500 to hold the saint&#x27;s remains and Eugippius became an abbot there. The estate is also well attested as the place of exile of the deposed emperor Romulus Augustulus Hence, the speculation that the Neapolitan woman Barbaria who received the relics in Castellum Lucullanum might have been Augustulus&#x27;s mother.

Martin Luther made reference to St. Severinus in point 29 of his Ninety-five Theses suggesting that it is unclear whether all of the souls in purgatory desire to be redeemed, as it is said not to have been the case, for example, with Saints Severinus and Paschalis.

<text>A security alarm is a system designed to detect intrusions, such as unauthorized entry, into a building or other areas, such as a home or school. Security alarms protect against burglary (theft) or property damage, as well as against intruders. Examples include personal systems, neighborhood security alerts, car alarms, and prison alarms.

Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion-alarm systems are combined with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to record intruders&#x27; activities and interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors. There are many types of security systems. Homeowners typically have small, self-contained noisemakers. These devices can also be complicated, multirole systems with computer monitoring and control. It may even include a two-way voice which allows communication between the panel and monitoring station.

== Components ==

The most basic alarm consists of at least one sensor to detect trespassers and an alerting device to indicate the intrusion. However, a typical premises security alarm employs the following components:

* Alarm control panel (ACP), or simply panel: The panel reads sensor inputs, tracks arm/disarm status, and signals intrusions. In a modern device, there are typically one or more computer circuit boards inside a metal enclosure. Many newer networks often use sealed plastic boxes. Some also have their control units built-into the keypad or other human-machine interface.
* Sensors: In a security alarm, some sensors detect intrusions. Sensors&#x27; locations are at the perimeter of the protected area, within it, or both. Sensors can detect intruders by different methods.
* Alerting devices indicate an alarm condition. Most commonly, these are bells, sirens, also and or flashing lights. Alerting devices serve the dual purpose of warning occupants of intrusion and potentially scaring off burglars.
* Keypads: Keypads are devices that function as the human-machine interface to the system. In addition to buttons, keypads typically feature indicator lights, a small multi-character display, or both.

In addition to the system itself, security alarms often offer a monitoring service. In the event of an alarm, the premises control unit contacts a central monitoring station. Operators at the station take appropriate action, such as contacting property owners, notifying the police, or dispatching private security forces. Such alerts transmit via dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the internet.

==Sensor types==

===Hermetically sealed reed switches===
The hermetically sealed reed switch is a common type of two-piece sensor. This switch operates with an electrically conductive switch that is either normally open or normally closed when under the influence of a magnetic field in respect to proximity to the second piece, which contains a magnet. When the magnet moves away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, based on the normally closed or open design. This action, coupled with an electric current, allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. These sensors are common, are found wired directly to an alarm control panel, or are typically found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.

===Passive infrared detectors===
The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is one of the most common sensors found in household and small business environments. This sensor does not generate or radiate energy; it works entirely by detecting the heat energy given off by other objects.

PIR sensors identify abrupt changes in temperature at a given point. As an intruder walks in front of the sensor, the temperature at that point will rise from room temperature to body temperature and then back again. This quick change triggers the detection.

PIR sensors designed to be wall- or ceiling-mounted come in various fields of view. PIRs require a power supply in addition to the detection signaling circuit.

=== Infrasound detectors ===

The infrasound detector works by detecting infrasound, or sound waves at frequencies below 20Hz. Sounds at those frequencies are inaudible to the human ear. Due to its inherent properties, infrasound can travel distances of many hundreds of kilometers.

The entire infrasound detection system consists of the following components: a speaker (infrasound sensor) as a microphone input, an order-frequency filter, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, and an microcomputer to analyze the recorded signal.
If a potential intruder tries to enter into a house, they test whether it is closed and locked, uses tools on openings, or/and applies pressure, creating low-frequency sound vibrations. Before the intruder breaks in, the infrasound detector automatically detects the intruder&#x27;s actions.

The purpose of such a system is to detect burglars before they enter the house to avoid both theft and vandalism. The sensitivity is dependent on the size of a home and the presence of animals.

===Ultrasonic detectors===
These active detectors transmit ultrasonic sound waves that are inaudible to humans using frequencies between 15 kHz and 75 kHz. The Doppler shift principle is the underlying method of operation which detects a change in frequency due to object motion. This detection occurs when the object must cause a change in the ultrasonic frequency to the receiver relative to the transmitting frequency.

The ultrasonic detector operates by the transmitter emitting an ultrasonic signal into the area to be protected. Solid objects (such as the surrounding floor, walls, and ceiling) reflect sound waves, which the receiver will detect. Because ultrasonic waves are transmitted through air, hard-surfaced objects tend to reflect most of the ultrasonic energy, while soft surfaces tend to absorb the most energy.

When the surfaces are stationary, the frequency of the waves detected by the receiver will be equal to the transmitted frequency. However, a change in frequency will occur as a result of the Doppler principle when a person or object is moving towards or away from the detector. Such an event initiates an alarm signal. This technology is not active in many properties as many consider this obsolete.

===Microwave detectors===
This device emits microwaves from a transmitter and detects any reflected microwaves or reduction in beam intensity using a receiver. The transmitter and receiver are usually combined inside a single housing (monostatic) for indoor applications and separate housings (bistatic) for the protection of outdoor perimeters high-risk sites and critical infrastructures such as fuel storage, petrochemical facilities, military sites, civil and military airports, nuclear facilities and more. To reduce false alarms this type of detector is usually combined with a passive infrared detector or similar alarm. Compared to the monostatic, the bistatic units work over longer distances: typical distances for transmitter-receivers up to 200m for X-band frequencies and up to 500m for K-band frequencies.

Microwave detectors respond to a Doppler shift in the frequency of the reflected energy, by a phase shift, or by a sudden reduction of the level of received energy. Any of these effects may indicate motion of an intruder. Microwave detectors are low cost, easy to install, have an invisible perimeter barrier. and is not affected by fog, rain, snow, sand storms, or wind. May be affected by the presence of water dripping on the ground. Typically need a sterile clearance area to prevent partial blocking of the detection field.

==== Functioning ====
The microwave generator is equipped with an antenna that allows it to concentrate the beam of electromagnetic waves in one preferred location and the beam is intercepted by the receiver, equipped with a similar antenna to the transmitter.

The graphical representation of the beam is similar to a cigar, and, when not disturbed, it runs between the transmitter and the receiver and generates a continuous signal. When an individual tries to cross this beam, it produces a disturbance that is caught by the receiver as a variation of amplitude of the received signal.

These barriers are immune to harsh weather, such as fog, heavy rain, snow and sandstorms: none of these atmospheric phenomena affect in any way the behaviour and the reliability of the microwave detection. Furthermore, the working temperature range of this technology goes from -35 °C to +70 °C.

==== Digital analysis of the signal ====
The more recent and higher performance models of these detectors generate a detection whether the intruder is rolling, crossing, crawling or moving very slow within the electromagnetic field reducing false alarms. The ellipsoidal shape of the longitudinal section however does not allow a good detection capability close to the receiver or transmitter heads, and those areas are commonly referred to as &quot;dead zones&quot;. A solution to avoid this problem, when installing 2 or more barriers, is to cross the respective transmitter and receiver heads some meters from the respective heads or to use mono-head sensor to cover the dead zones.

===Compact surveillance radar===
Compact surveillance radar emits microwaves from a transmitter and detects any reflected microwaves. They are similar to microwave detectors but can detect the precise location and a GPS coordinate of intruders in areas extending over hundreds of acres. It has the capability of measuring the range, angle, velocity, direction, and size of the target. This target information is typically displayed on a map, user interface or situational awareness software that defines geographical alert zones or geofences with different types of actions initiated depending on time of day and other factors. CSR is commonly used to protect outside the fence line of critical facilities such as electrical substations, power plants, dams, and bridges.

===Photoelectric beams===
Photoelectric beam systems detect the presence of an intruder by transmitting invisible infrared light beams across an area, where these beams may be obstructed. To improve the detection surface area, the beams are often employed in stacks of two or more. However, if an intruder is aware of the technology&#x27;s presence, it can be avoided. The technology can be an effective long-range detection system, if installed in stacks of three or more where the transmitters and receivers are staggered to create a fence-like barrier. To prevent a clandestine attack using a secondary light source being used to hold the detector in a sealed condition whilst an intruder passes through, most systems use and detect a modulated light source. These sensors are low cost, easy to install, and require very little sterile clearance area to operate. However, it may be affected by fog or very high luminosity, and the position of the transmitter can be located with cameras.

===Glass-break detection===
A glass-break detector may be used for internal perimeter building protection. Glass-break acoustic detectors are mounted in close proximity to the glass panes and listen for sound frequencies associated with glass breaking.

Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.

Window foil is a less advanced detection method that involves gluing a thin strip of conducting foil on the inside of the glass and putting low-power electric current through it. Breaking the glass will tear the foil and break the circuit.

===Smoke, heat, and carbon monoxide detectors===
Most systems can also be equipped with smoke, heat, and/or carbon monoxide detectors. These are also known as 24-hour zones (which are on at all times). Smoke and heat detectors protect from the risk of fire using different detection methods. Carbon monoxide detectors help protect from the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Although an intruder alarm panel may also have these detectors connected, it may not meet all the local fire code requirements of a fire alarm system.

Traditional smoke detectors are ionization smoke detectors which create an electric current between two metal plates, which sound an alarm when disrupted by smoke entering the chamber. Ionization smoke alarms can quickly detect the small amounts of particles produced by fast-flaming fires, such as cooking fires or those fueled by paper or flammable liquids. A newer type of the smoke detector is the photoelectric smoke detector. It contains a light source, which is positioned indirectly to the light sensitive electric sensor. Normally, light from the light source shoots straight across and misses the sensor. When smoke enters the chamber, it scatters the light, which then hits the sensor and triggers the alarm. Photoelectric smoke detectors typically respond faster to a fire in its early, smoldering stage, before the source of the fire bursts into flames.

===Motion sensors===
Motion sensors are devices that use various forms of technology to detect movement. The technology typically found in motion sensors to trigger an alarm includes infrared, ultrasonic, vibration and contact. Dual technology sensors combine two or more forms of detection in order to reduce false alarms as each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Traditionally motion sensors are an integral part of a home security system. These devices are typically installed to cover a large area as they commonly cover up to , with a 135° field of vision.

A type of motion sensor was used by the Japanese since ancient times. In the past, &quot;(m)any people in Japan kept singing crickets and used them like watch dogs.&quot; Although a dog would bark when it senses an intruder, a cricket stops singing when approached by an intruder. The crickets are kept in decorative cages resembling bird cages, and these cages are placed in contact with the floor. During the day, the house is busy with normal daytime tasks. When activity reduces at night, the crickets start singing. If someone comes into the house at night, the floor starts to vibrate. &quot;The vibration frightens the crickets and they stop singing. Then everyone wakes up --- from the silence. The family is used to hearing crickets at night and knows something is wrong if the crickets aren&#x27;t singing. A similar observation was made in England about millers who lived in their mills. A mill wheel makes a great deal of noise, but the miller only awakens when the mill wheel stops turning.

===Driveway alarms===
Driveway alarm systems can be combined with most security and automation systems. They are designed to alert residents to unexpected visitors, intruders, or deliveries arriving at the property. Types of driveway sensors include magnetic and infrared motion sensors. Driveway alarms can be found in both hard-wired and wireless systems. They are common in rural security systems as well as for commercial applications.

===Electro-mechanical (shaker) sensors===
These electro-mechanical devices are mounted on barriers and are used primarily to detect an attack on the structure itself. The technology relies on an unstable mechanical configuration that forms part of the electrical circuit. When movement or vibration occurs, the unstable portion of the circuit moves and breaks the current flow, which produces an alarm. The medium transmitting the vibration must be correctly selected for the specific sensor as they are best suited to different types of structures and configurations. These systems are low cost and easily installed on existing fences, but can only be fence mounted and are unable to analyze differences in the pattern of vibrations (for example, the difference between gusts of wind and a person climbing the fence). For this reason, this technology is gradually being replaced by digital accelerometer-based systems.

=== MEMS Accelerometer ===
MEMS technology is an electromagnetic device that is created using photolithography, incision and ionian implantation. This produces a very compact and small device. In this device, in addition to the mechanical system, there are electronic circuits for control, acquisition and conditioning of the signal able to sense the environment.

MEMS accelerometer can be divided into two groups, piezoresistive and capacitive-based accelerometers. The former consists of a single-degree-of-freedom system of a mass suspended by a spring. They also have a beam with a proof mass at the beam’s tip and a Piezoresistive patch on the beam web.

On the contrary, capacitive-based accelerometers, also known as vibration sensors, rely on a change in electrical capacitance in response to acceleration.

==== Operating principle ====
The current technology allows to realize suspended silicon structures that are attached to the substrate in some points called anchors, and that constitute the sensitive mass of the accelerometer MEMS. These structures are free to move in the direction of the acceleration detected. They constitute the mobile reinforcement of a pair of capacitors connected to the &quot;half bridge&quot;.

In this way, the acquired signals are amplified, filtered and converted in digital signals with the supervision of specific control circuits. MEMS&#x27; incorporations evolved from a single, stand-alone device to the integrated inertial motion units that are available today.

This technology uses a variety of transduction mechanisms to detect the displacement. They include capacitive, piezoresistive, thermal, optical, piezoelectric and tunneling.

==== Applications ====

In the last decades, many technological progresses have been made in this area and MEMS accelerometers are used in high-reliability environments and are starting to replace other established technologies.

MEMS accelerometer can be applied as a sensor in the earthquake disaster prevention, since one of the main characteristics of MEMS accelerometers is the linear frequency response to DC to about 500 Hz, and this capability offers an improvement in measuring ground motion at lower-frequency band.

Another practical application of MEMS accelerometers is in machine condition monitoring to reduce machines’ maintenance. Wireless and embedded technologies such as Micro-electro Mechanical system sensors offer a wireless smart vibration measurement of machine’s condition.

Moving to the defence field, it can be applied in fence-mounted intrusion detection systems. Since MEMS sensors are able to work in a wide temperature range, they can prevent intrusions in outdoors and very spread-off perimeters.

==== Properties ====
An advantage offered by MEMS Accelerometers is the ability to measure static accelerations, such as acceleration due to gravity. This enables them to constantly verify that the positioning of the sensor, based on MEMS accelerometer, remains unaltered from the installation one.

MEMS accelerometers’ significant advantages also stem from their small size and high measurement frequency; additionally, they can be integrated with multiple sensors with different functions.

===Ferrous metal detectors===
Change in the local magnetic field due to the presence of ferrous metals induces a current in the buried sensors (buried cables or discrete sensors) which are analyzed by the system. If the change exceeds a predetermined threshold, an alarm is generated. This type of sensor can be used to detect intruders carrying substantial amounts of metal, such as a firearm, making it ideally suited for anti-poaching applications.

===Electrostatic field===
Sometimes referred to as E-field, this volumetric sensor uses Electric field proximity sensing and can be installed on buildings, perimeters, fences, and walls. It also has the ability to be installed free-standing on dedicated poles. The system uses an electromagnetic field generator powering one wire, with another sensing wire running parallel to it. The sensing wire is connected to a signal processor that analyses amplitude change (mass of intruder), rate change (movement of intruder), and preset disturbance time (time the intruder is in the pattern). These items define the characteristics of an intruder and when all three are detected simultaneously, an alarm signal is generated.

The barrier can provide vertical protection from the ground to the height of the mounting posts (typically 4–6meters of height), depending on the number of sensor wires installed. It is usually configured in zones of about 200 metre lengths. Electrostatic field sensors are high-security and difficult to defeat, and have high vertical detection field. However, these sensors are expensive and have short zones, which contributes to more electronics (and thus a higher cost).

===Microphonic systems===

Microphonic systems vary in design (for example, time-domain reflectrometer or piezo-electric) but each is generally based on the detection of an intruder attempting to cut or climb over a fence. Usually the microphonic detection systems are installed as sensor cables attached to rigid chain-wire fences, however, some specialized versions of these systems can also be installed buried underground. Depending on the type, it can be sensitive to different frequencies or levels of noise or vibration. The system is based on coaxial or electro-magnetic sensor cable with the controller having the ability to differentiate between signals from the cable or chain-wire being cut, an intruder climbing the fence, or bad weather conditions.

The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed pre-set conditions. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. The tuning of the system is usually done during commissioning of the detection devices.

Microphonic systems are relatively inexpensive compared to other systems and easy to install, but older systems may have a high rate of false alarms caused by wind and other distances. Some newer systems use DSP to process the signal and reduce false alarms.

===Taut wire fence systems===
A taut wire perimeter security system is an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made thicker to avoid the need for a supporting chain-wire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.

Taut wire fence systems have low false alarm rates, reliable sensors, and high detection rates, but is expensive and complicated to install.

===Fiber optic cable===
A fiber-optic cable can be used to detect intruders by measuring the difference in the amount of light sent through the fiber core. A variety of fiber optic sensing technologies may be used, including Rayleigh scattering or interferometry. If the cable is disturbed, the light will change and the intrusion is detected. The cable can be attached directly to a chain-wire fence or bonded into a barbed steel tape that is used to protect the tops of walls and fences. This type of barbed tape provides a good physical deterrent as well as giving an immediate alarm if the tape is cut or severely distorted.

Being cable-based, fiber optic cables are very similar to the microphonic system and easy to install and can cover large perimeters. However, despite performing in a similar manner to microphonic-based systems, fiber optic cables have higher cost and is more complex due to the use of fiber-optic technology.

===Ported coaxial cable===

This system employs an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based on two unshielded coaxial cables. The transmitter emits continuous radio frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable. When the change in field strength weakens due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is covert after installation. The surrounding soil must offer good drainage in order to avoid nuisance alarms. Ported coaxial cables are concealed as a buried form but can be affected by RF noise and is difficult to install.

===Security electric fence===

Security electric fences consist of wires that carry pulses of electric current to provide a non-lethal shock to deter potential intruders. Tampering with the fence also results in an alarm that is logged by the security electric fence energiser, and can also trigger a siren, strobe, and/or notifications to a control room or directly to the owner via email or phone. In practical terms, security electric fences are a type of sensor array that acts as a (or part of a) physical barrier, a psychological deterrent to potential intruders, and as part of a security alarm system.

Electric fences are less expensive than many other methods, less likely to give false alarms than many other alternative perimeter security methods, and have highest psychological deterrent of all methods, but there is a potential for unintended shock.

== Wired, wireless, and hybrid systems==

The trigger signal from sensors are transmitted to one or more control units either through wires or wireless means, such as radio, line carrier, and infrared.

Wired systems are convenient when sensors, such as passive infrared motion sensors and smoke detectors require external power to operate correctly; however, they may be more costly to install. Basic wired systems utilize a star network topology, where the panel is at the center logically, and all devices home run their line wires back to the panel. More complex panels use a Bus network topology where the wire basically is a data loop around the perimeter of the facility, and has drops for the sensor devices which must include a unique device identifier integrated into the sensor device itself. Wired systems also have the advantage, if wired properly for example by dual loop, of being tamper-evident.

Wireless systems, on the other hand, often use battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have less expensive start-up costs, but may fail if the batteries are not maintained. Depending on distance and construction materials, one or more wireless repeaters may be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new property easily. An important wireless connection for security is between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system protects against a burglar cutting cables or from failures of an internet provider. This setup is commonly referred to as fully wireless.

Hybrid systems use both wired and wireless sensors to achieve the benefits of both. Transmitters can also be connected through the premises&#x27; electrical circuits to transmit coded signals to the control unit (line carrier). The control unit usually has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensors, and more advanced systems have a separate zone for every different sensor, as well as internal trouble indicators, such as mains power loss, low battery, and broken wires.

==Alarm connection and monitoring==
Depending upon the application, the alarm output may be local, remote or a combination of both. Local alarms do not include monitoring, but may include indoor and/or outdoor sounders, such as motorized bells or electronic sirens and lights, such strobe lights which may be useful for signaling an evacuation notice during fire emergencies, or to scare off an amateur burglar quickly. However, with the widespread use of alarm systems, especially in cars, false alarms are very frequent and many urbanites tend to ignore alarms rather than investigating, and not contacting the necessary authorities. In rural areas where not many may hear the fire bell or burglar siren, lights or sounds may not make much difference, as the nearest emergency responders may arrive too late to avoid losses.

Remote alarm systems are used to connect the control unit to a predetermined monitor of some sort, and they are available in many different configurations. Advanced systems connect to a central station or first responder (e.g. police/fire/medical) via a direct phone wire, a cellular network, a radio network, or an IP path. In the case of a dual signaling system two of these options are utilized simultaneously. The alarm monitoring includes not only the sensors, but also the communication transmitter itself. While direct phone circuits are still available in some areas from phone companies, because of their high cost and the advent of dual signaling with its comparatively lower cost, their use is being phased out. Direct connections are now most usually seen only in federal, state, and local government buildings, or on a school campus that has a dedicated security, police, fire, or emergency medical department. In the United Kingdom, communication is only possible to an alarm receiving centre, and communication directly to the emergency services is not permitted.

More typical systems incorporate a digital cellular communication unit that will contact the central station or a monitoring station via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and raise the alarm, either with a synthesized voice or increasingly via an encoded message string that the central station decodes. These may connect to the regular phone system on the system side of the demarcation point, but typically connect on the customer side ahead of all phones within the monitored premises so that the alarm system can seize the line by cutting-off any active calls and call the monitoring company if needed. A dual signaling system would raise the alarm wirelessly via a radio path or cellular path using the phone line or broadband line as a backup overcoming any compromise to the phone line. Encoders can be programmed to indicate which specific sensor was triggered, and monitors can show the physical location of the sensor on a list or even a map of the protected premises, which can make the resulting response more effective.

Many alarm panels are equipped with a backup communication path for use when the primary PSTN circuit is not functioning. The redundant dialer may be connected to a second communication path, or a specialized encoded cellular phone, radio, or internet interface device to bypass the PSTN entirely, to thwart intentional tampering with the phone lines. Tampering with the line could trigger a supervisory alarm via the radio network, giving early warning of an imminent problem. In some cases a remote building may not have PSTN phone service, and the cost of trenching and running a direct line may be prohibitive. It is possible to use a wireless cellular or radio device as the primary communication method.

In the UK, the most popular solution of this kind is similar in principle to the above but with the primary and backup paths reversed. Utilizing a radio path as the primary signaling path is not only quicker than PSTN but also allows significant cost savings as unlimited amounts of data can be sent at no extra expense.

==Broadband alarm monitoring==
Increasing deployment of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Many sites requiring alarm installations no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.

Dial-up analogue alarm panels or systems with serial/parallel data ports may be migrated to broadband through the addition of an alarm server device which converts telephone signaling signals or data port traffic to IP messages suitable for broadband transmission. However, the direct use of VoIP to transport analogue alarms without an alarm server device is problematic as the audio codecs used throughout the entire network transmission path cannot guarantee a suitable level of reliability or quality of service acceptable for the application.

In response to the changing public communications network, new alarm systems often use broadband signaling as a method of alarm transmission, and manufacturers are including IP reporting capability directly in their alarm panel products. When the Internet is used as a primary signaling method for critical security and life safety applications, frequent supervision messages are configured to overcome concerns about backup power for network equipment and signal delivery time. But for typical applications, connectivity concerns are controlled by normal supervision messages.

==Radio alarm dual signaling==
Dual signaling is a method of alarm transmission that uses a mobile phone network and a telephone and/or IP path to transmit intruder, fire and personal attack signals at high speed from the protected premises to an Alarm Receiving Centre (ARC). It most commonly uses GPRS or GSM, a high-speed signaling technology used to send and receive ‘packets’ of data, with a telephone line in addition. IP is not used as frequently due to issues with installation and configuration as high levels of expertise is often required in addition to alarm installation knowledge.

A dual signaling communication device is attached to a control panel on a security installation and is the component that transmits the alarm to the ARC. It can do this in a number of different ways, via the GPRS radio path, via the GSM radio path or via the telephone line/or IP. These multiple signaling paths are all present and live at the same time backing each other up to minimize exposure of the property to intruders. Should one fail, there is always a back up and depending on the manufacturer chosen up to three paths working simultaneously at any one time.

Dual paths allow distinction between hardware failures and a genuine attack on the alarm. This helps eliminate false alarms and unnecessary responses. Dual signaling has helped considerably with the restoration of police response as in an instance where a phone line is cut as the dual signaling device can continue to send alarm calls via one of its alternative paths either confirming or denying the alarm from the initial path.

In the UK, CSL DualCom Ltd pioneered dual signaling in 1996. The company offered an alternative to existing alarm signaling while setting the current standard for professional dual path security monitoring. Dual signaling is now firmly regarded as the standard format for alarm signaling and is duly specified by all of the leading insurance companies.

==Listen-in alarm monitoring==
Monitored alarms and speaker phones allow for the central station to speak with the homeowner or intruder. This may be beneficial to the owner for medical emergencies. For actual break-ins, the speaker phones allow the central station to urge the intruder to cease and desist as response units have been dispatched. Listen-in alarm monitoring is also known as Immediate Audio-Response monitoring or Speaking Alarm Systems in the UK.

==Alarm response==
In the United States, police respond to at least 36million alarm activations each year, at an estimated annual cost of $1.8billion. 
Depending upon the zone triggered, number and sequence of zones, time of day, and other factors, the alarm monitoring center may automatically initiate various actions. Central station operators might be instructed to call emergency services immediately, or to first call the protected premises or property manager to try to determine if the alarm is genuine. Operators could also start calling a list of phone numbers provided by the customer to contact someone to go check on the protected premises. Some zones may trigger a call to the local heating oil company to check on the system, or a call to the owner with details of which room may be flooded. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor and recorded.

Some alarm systems use real-time audio and video monitoring technology to verify the legitimacy of an alarm. In some municipalities around the United States, this type of alarm verification allows the property it is protecting to be placed on a &quot;verified response&quot; list, allowing for quicker and safer police responses.

==Access control and bypass codes==
To be useful, an intrusion alarm system is deactivated or reconfigured when authorized personnel are present. Authorization may be indicated in any number of ways, often with keys or codes used at the control panel or a remote panel near an entry. High-security alarms may require multiple codes, or a fingerprint, badge, hand-geometry, retinal scan, encrypted-response generator, and other means that are deemed sufficiently secure for the purpose.

Failed authorizations would result in an alarm or a timed lockout to prevent experimenting with possible codes. Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensors or groups. Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors and leave the remainder of the system armed. This feature is useful for permitting a single door to be opened and closed before the alarm is armed, or to permit a person to leave, but not return. High-end systems allow multiple access codes, and may only permit them to be used once, or on particular days, or only in combination with other users&#x27; codes (i.e., escorted). In any case, a remote monitoring center should arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unnecessary. As with access codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, for example, for furnace repairperson to enter the kitchen and basement sensor areas but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that permit a duress code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery.

Fire sensors can be isolated, meaning that when triggered, they will not trigger the main alarm network. This is important when smoke and heat is intentionally produced. The owners of buildings can be fined for generating false alarms that waste the time of emergency personnel.

==False and absent alarms==
The United States Department of Justice estimates that between 94% and 98% of all alarm calls to law enforcement are false alarms.

System reliability and user error are the cause of most false alarms, sometimes called &quot;nuisance alarms.&quot; False alarms can be very costly to local governments, local law enforcement, security system users and members of local communities. In 2007, the Department of Justice reported that in just one year, false alarms cost local municipalities and their constituents at least $1.8 billion.

In many municipalities across the United States, policies have been adopted to fine home and business owners for multiple false alarm activations from their security system. If multiple false alarms from the same property persist, that property could be added to a &quot;no response&quot; list, which prevents police dispatch to the property except in the event of verified emergency. Approximately 1% of police alarm calls actually involve a crime. Nuisance alarms occur when an unintended event evokes an alarm status by an otherwise properly working alarm system. A false alarm also occurs when there is an alarm system malfunction that results in an alarm state. In all three circumstances, the source of the problem should be immediately found and fixed, so that responders will not lose confidence in the alarm reports. It is easier to know when there are false alarms, because the system is designed to react to that condition. Failure alarms are more troublesome because they usually require periodic testing to make sure the sensors are working and that the correct signals are getting through to the monitor. Some systems are designed to detect problems internally, such as low or dead batteries, loose connections, phone circuit trouble, etc. While earlier nuisance alarms could be set off by small disturbances, like insects or pets, newer model alarms have technology to measure the size/weight of the object causing the disturbance, and thus are able to decide how serious the threat is, which is especially useful in burglar alarms.

Some municipalities across the United States require alarm verification before police are dispatched. Under this approach, alarm monitoring companies must verify the legitimacy of alarms (except holdup, duress, and panic alarms) before calling the police. Verified response typically involves visual on-scene verification of a break-in, or remote audio or video verification.

==Audio and video verification==
Alarms that utilize audio, video, or combination of both audio and video verification technology give security companies, dispatchers, police officers, and property managers more reliable data to assess the threat level of a triggered alarm.

Audio and video verification techniques use microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image snapshots. The source audio and video streams are sent over a communication link, usually an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the central station where monitors retrieve the images through proprietary software. The information is then relayed to law enforcement and recorded to an event file, which can be used to plan a more strategic and tactical approach of a property, and later as prosecution evidence.

An example of this system is when a passive infrared or other sensor is triggered a designated number of video frames from before and after the event is sent to the central station.

A second video solution can be incorporated into a standard panel, which sends the central station an alarm. When a signal is received, a trained monitoring professional accesses the on-site digital video recorder (DVR) through an IP link to determine the cause of the activation. For this type of system, the camera input to the DVR reflects the alarm panel&#x27;s zones and partitioning, which allows personnel to look for an alarm source in multiple areas.

The United States Department of Justice states that legislation requiring alarm companies to verify the legitimacy of an alarm, before contacting law enforcement (commonly known as &quot;verified response&quot;) is the most effective way to reduce false burglar alarms. The Department of Justice considers audio, video, or an eye-witness account as verification for the legitimacy of a burglar alarm.

==Cross-zoning==
Cross-zoning is a strategy that uses multiple sensors to monitor activity in one area and software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor notifies the customer. A second alarm signal—received in an adjacent zone within a short time—is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch immediately. This method builds increased protection.

==Enhanced call verification==
Enhanced call verification (ECV) helps reduce false dispatches while still protecting citizens, and is mandated in several US jurisdictions, although the alarm industry has successfully opposed it in others. ECV requires central station personnel to attempt to verify the alarm activation by making a minimum of two phone calls to two different responsible party telephone numbers before dispatching law enforcement to the scene.

The first alarm-verification call goes to the location the alarm originated. If contact with a person is not made, a second call is placed to a different number. The secondary number, best practices dictate, should be to a telephone that is answered even after hours, preferably a cellular phone of a decision maker authorized to request or bypass emergency response.

ECV, as it cannot confirm an actual intrusion event and will not prompt a priority law enforcement dispatch, is not considered true alarm verification by the security industry.

==Independent certification==
Some insurance companies and local agencies require that alarm systems be installed to code or be certified by an independent third party. The alarm system is required to have a maintenance check carried out every 6 – 12 months. In the UK, &#x27;Audible Only&#x27; intruder alarm systems require a routine service visit once every 12 months and monitored intruder alarm systems require a check twice in every 12-month period. This is to ensure all internal components, sensors and PSUs are functioning correctly. In the past, this would require an alarm service engineer to attend site and carry the checks out. With the use of the Internet or radio path and a compatible IP/radio transmitting device (at the alarmed premises), some checks can now be carried out remotely from the central station.

<doc id="1294760" wikidata="Q1266095" url="?curid=1294760" title="Tuoshan">
<text>Tuoshan () is a mountain located south-west of Qingzhou city, Shandong province, China. It features a number of historic sites and a native pine forest. Tuoshan is the core scenic zone of Qingzhou National Park.

==Qiaoyu&#x27;s Calligraphy==
Qiaoyu was a chief official of Qingzhou during the Ming dynasty, and inscribed the characters &#x27;Tuo Shan&#x27; on the eastern face of the mountain.

==Haotian Temple==
Haotian Temple (&quot;Hao Tian Gong&quot; in pinyin) measures 150 m from north to south and 100 m from east to west. It lies on the summit of Tuoshan, and commands a view northward to Qingzhou. The temple itself consists of a group of ancient structures, including an old theatre, Yuhuang Palace, Seven Treasures Cabinet, and a garden of stone &#x27;stelae&#x27; or tablets. A tablet on the site records the rebuilding of the temple in the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). The temple has undergone further repairs since 1986.

===Yuhuang Palace===
This building is part of Haotian Temple on the summit of the mountain.

===Qibao Cabinet===
Seven Treasures (&quot;Qi bao&quot;) Cabinet was built in the Yuan dynasty. It is a non-beam, double-arched stone structure and is rare in China.

==River in the Sky==
&quot;Tian He&quot;. Adjacent to Haotian Temple. It was completely dry as of 2004 and it is doubtful that it ever &#x27;flows&#x27;. A more realistic translation might be &#x27;pool&#x27; or &#x27;pond&#x27;.

==Bridge in the Sky==
&quot;Tian Qiao&quot;. The bridge crosses the &#x27;River in the Sky&#x27;, and provides an entrance to Haotian Temple.

==Heavenly Spring==
&quot;Tian Quan&quot;. Possibly another name for the &#x27;River in the Sky&#x27;.

==Wulong Pool==
Possibly another name for the &#x27;River in the Sky&#x27;.

==Gate of the Southern Heaven==
&quot;Tian Nan Men&quot; in pinyin. A recently constructed or reconstructed Chinese gateway atop mountain.

==Buddhist Grottoes==

There are 638 stone Buddhas in five main grottoes, which were chiselled in the Northern Zhou (577–581) and Tang dynasty (613–907) and lie along the mountain&#x27;s eastern edge, close to the summit. All of the smaller grottoes are now empty. The main grottoes are mostly intact with the exception of many of the smaller-Buddha&#x27;s heads. They are protected by cages. The tallest statue, that of a seated Buddha, still survives. It is over 7 m high, making it the largest in the province. The smallest statues at the site are about tall. The site was placed under national protection in 1988.

<text>Marcel Conche (; 27 March 1922 – 27 February 2022) was a French philosopher and emeritus professor at the Sorbonne University (Paris).

==Biography==
Marcel Conche was born in Altillac, France.

&quot;Philosophizing ad infinitum&quot; has been published by SUNY (State University of New York) Press, June 2014. It is the translation of one of his major works: &quot;Philosopher à l&#x27;infini&quot;, published by PUF, Presses Universitaires de France, in 2005. 
A recent publication (2003), the Tao Te Ching translation and comments in French, follows the format of previous works, such as &quot;Héraclite - Fragments&quot; (fragments of Heraclitus): 
* French translation of the original text
* Commentary in the immediately ensuing chapter

In this book he draws an interesting parallel between the nearly contemporaries Lao Zi (see Tao Te Ching) and Heraclitus: the river of the Greek is compared to the Dao of the Chinese.

In some cases (such as the Heraclitus) the text (as handed down by tradition, copyists, historians or other authors quoting the now unavailable original text) is reordered to follow a more logical order, from the simplest of principles to the most advanced.

He was created a Commander of the Order of the Arts and the Letters and a Knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honour.

Conche died on 27 February 2022, at the age of 99, a month shy of turning 100.

<doc id="1294783" wikidata="Q2370975" url="?curid=1294783" title="Mona Juul">
<text>Mona Juul (born 10 April 1959) is a Norwegian diplomat and former politician for the Labour Party. She worked at the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has been an ambassador to several different countries. Juul hails from Sparbu, and was educated in political science. She played a key role facilitating the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. On 25 July 2019, Juul was elected President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

== Oslo Accords ==

Along with her husband Terje Rød-Larsen, Juul played a key role in the 1990s Oslo Accords—pivotal agreements on Middle East peace. The secret negotiations, largely arranged and facilitated by Juul and her husband, led to the peace agreement signing on 13 September 1993 in Washington D.C., of the first-ever agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).&quot;

Juul and the rest of the Oslo team of facilitators focused on the conflict between Israel and the PLO, knowing that a peace agreement would have to be created by the adversaries themselves and that a group acting as mediator would be vital in making appropriate arrangements for negotiations.

The 2016 Broadway play, &quot;Oslo&quot; by noted playwright J. T. Rogers, is a widely praised dramatization of the previously unheralded role of Juul and her husband, and others, in developing the back-channel communications that (reportedly) saved the Oslo negotiations from collapsing.

== 21st century career ==
During the first cabinet Stoltenberg, from 2000 to 2001, Juul was appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2001 to 2004 she served as the Norwegian ambassador to Israel. From 2005 to 2010 she served as a deputy director and ambassador in the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations in New York City. In 2014, she succeeded Kim Traavik as Ambassador to the United Kingdom.

On 7 September 2018, she was nominated to become the next permanent representative of Norway to the United Nations. She presented her credentials to UN Secretary General António Guterres on 14 January 2019, and assumed office the same day. As permanent representative, she notably spearheaded the successful Norwegian campaign for a seat at the UN Security Council for the 2021–2022 term. In January 2023, Merete Fjeld Brattested was nominated as her successor. Brattested officially took over on 1 September.

In October 2024, she was nominated as the new ambassador to Jordan.

<text>Augustin Bizimungu (born 28 August 1952) is a Rwandan convicted war criminal and former general of the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR). On 16 April 1994, at the start of the genocide against the Tutsi, he was appointed chief of staff of the army and promoted to the rank of major general. In 2011, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the Rwandan genocide.

==Biography==
Bizimungu was born in Byumba préfecture, Mukarange Commune, Mugina Secteur, Nyange Cellule, Rwanda.

An ethnic Hutu, Bizimungu held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the FAR on 6 April 1994. Some days later, in the wake of Déogratias Nsabimana&#x27;s death alongside Juvénal Habyarimana, Bizimungu was promoted to major general and appointed as chief of staff of the Rwandan Army of the FAR, replacing Marcel Gatsinzi.

Upon fleeing the country following the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) victory, he reportedly declared that &quot;The RPF will rule over a desert.&quot;

On 12 April 2002, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) issued an arrest warrant for Bizimungu, who was apparently working with the Angolan rebel movement UNITA. In August 2002, he was arrested by the Angolan government and taken to the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in Tanzania.
The trial adjourned until September 2008, whereupon Bizimungu was tried along with fellow FAR officers Augustin Ndindiliyimana (Chief of Staff of the National Gendarmerie), François-Xavier Nzuwonemeye (Commander of the Reconnaissance Battalion of the Rwandan Army) and Innocent Sagahutu (Second-in-Command of the Reconnaissance Battalion of the Rwandan Army). Bizimungu was sentenced to thirty years in prison for his part in the genocide on 17 May 2011. 

Bizimungu is portrayed by Fana Mokoena in the 2004 movie &quot;Hotel Rwanda.&quot;

<text>Terry Moore (born Helen Luella Koford; January 7, 1929) is an American actress who began her career as a child actor. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; (1952).

==Biography==
===Child actress===
Moore was born January 7, 1929, in Glendale, California, and grew up in a Mormon family in Los Angeles. 

Moore&#x27;s early appearances include &quot;The Howards of Virginia&quot; (1940), &quot;On the Sunny Side&quot; (1942), &quot;My Gal Sal&quot; (1942), &quot;A-Haunting We Will Go&quot; (1942), &quot;True to Life&quot; (1943), &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944) (playing Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s character as a child), &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944), &quot;Sweet and Low-Down&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Clock&quot; (1945). 
As Helen Koford, she had a supporting role in &quot;Son of Lassie&quot; (1945) and &quot;Shadowed&quot; (1946). As &quot;Jan Ford&quot; she was billed third in &quot;The Devil on Wheels&quot; (1947) at Monogram. She was uncredited in &quot;Heartaches&quot; (1948) and &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (1948).

Moore worked in radio in the 1940s, most memorably as Bumps Smith on &quot;The Smiths of Hollywood&quot;.

===Columbia===
Moore&#x27;s career received a boost when Columbia Pictures signed her to a long-term contract. She had the lead in &quot;The Return of October&quot; (1948) with Glenn Ford, playing a character called Terry Ramsey, after which Terry became her stage name.

Moore was borrowed by RKO to star in &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1949), a film about a giant gorilla that won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. George Pal cast her in &quot;The Great Rupert&quot; (1950) with Jimmy Durante.
At Columbia, Moore co-starred with Mickey Rooney in &quot;He&#x27;s a Cockeyed Wonder&quot; (1950). She also did &quot;Gambling House&quot; (1950) with Victor Mature at RKO, &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (1951), &quot;Sunny Side of the Street&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Barefoot Mailman&quot; (1951).

Moore played Marie Buckholder in &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; (1952), produced by Hal Wallis, with Burt Lancaster and Shirley Booth as co-stars. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. 

Moore began appearing in television shows like &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot; and appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine on July 6, 1953, as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s sexy tomboy&quot;. Her photo was used on the cover of the second issue of the &quot;My Diary&quot; romance comic book (cover dated March 1950).

===20th Century Fox===
Elia Kazan cast Moore in the female lead in the 20th Century Fox drama &quot;Man on a Tightrope&quot; (1953). Fox then signed Moore to a long-term contract. It gave her the female lead in &quot;Beneath the 12-Mile Reef&quot; (1953), the second film in CinemaScope and a big hit. Also popular was &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; (1953) with Tyrone Power.

Moore supported Fred Astaire in &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; (1955) and had the lead in some thrillers: &quot;Shack Out on 101&quot; (1955) and &quot;Portrait of Alison&quot; (1955).

&quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1956) reunited her with Robert Wagner, the leading man in &quot;Beneath the 12-Mile Reef&quot;. She guest-starred on TV shows like &quot;The 20th Century-Fox Hour&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;Rawhide&quot;.

Fox used her in &quot;Bernardine&quot; (1957) with Pat Boone and &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957) with Lana Turner. They then put her in the less popular &quot;A Private&#x27;s Affair&quot; (1959). She was Audie Murphy&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Cast a Long Shadow&quot; (1959).

===1960s===
Moore had the lead in &quot;Platinum High School&quot; (1960) and &quot;Why Must I Die?&quot; (1960), producing the latter.

Moore guest starred on &quot;Checkmate&quot; and &quot;The Rebel&quot; and had a regular role as a rancher&#x27;s daughter in the NBC Western &quot;Empire&quot;. She also appeared on the NBC interview program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;.

Other appearances during this period include &quot;Black Spurs&quot; (1965), &quot;Town Tamer&quot; (1965), &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, &quot;Waco&quot; (1966), and &quot;A Man Called Dagger&quot; (1968) as well as episodes of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, and &quot;Batman&quot;.

===1970s===
Moore&#x27;s 1970s appearances included &quot;Quarantined&quot; (1970), &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Daredevil&quot; (1972), &quot;Smash-Up on Interstate 5&quot; (1976), and &quot;Death Dimension&quot; (1978).

===1980s===
In the 1980s Moore&#x27;s roles included appearances in &quot;Double Exposure&quot; (1982), &quot;Hellhole&quot; (1985), &quot;Going Overboard&quot; (1989), &quot;American Boyfriends&quot; (1989), and &quot;Jake Spanner, Private Eye&quot; (1989) and episodes of &quot;Matt Houston&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;True Confessions&quot;, and &quot;Wiseguy&quot;.

At age 55, Moore posed nude in the August 1984 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, photographed by Ken Marcus. She also appeared in theatre.

Moore appeared in &quot;Beverly Hills Brats&quot; (1989).

===Later career===
Moore was in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Marilyn and Me&quot; (both in 1991); &quot;American Southern&quot; (1995); &quot;Second Chances&quot; (1998) (which she also produced); &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1998); and &quot;Final Voyage&quot; (1999).

Moore produced but did not appear in &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; and &quot;Nandi&quot; (1998).

In the 2000s, Moore&#x27;s appearances include roles in &quot;Stageghost&quot; (2000), &quot;Kill Your Darlings&quot; (2006), &quot;The Still Life&quot; (2007), &quot;Dewitt &amp; Maria&quot; (2010), a guest-starring role as Lilly Hill on the crime series &quot;True Detective&quot; (2014), &quot;Aimy in a Cage&quot; (2015), &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;, and &quot;Silent Life&quot; (2019).

==Personal life==
Moore married American football star and Heisman Trophy winner Glenn Davis (known as &quot;Mr. Outside&quot; when he played at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point) in 1951. They were divorced the following year. A subsequent marriage to in 1956 lasted three years. One year after this marriage ended, Moore married Stuart Cramer after his divorce from Jean Peters; they had two children together, Stuart Cramer IV and actor Grant Cramer, before divorcing in 1972. In 1979, Moore claimed to have married Richard F. Carey, in Mexico; he disappeared a few days later, having swindled her and others out of their money. Her 1992 marriage to Jerry Rivers lasted until his death in 2001.

Moore became the subject of public attention as a result of her relationship with Howard Hughes. According to Moore, she and Hughes were married in 1949 in a ceremony performed by a ship captain in international waters. Moore has said that Hughes destroyed the ship&#x27;s log that recorded the marriage, and they separated from each other by 1956, but she and Hughes were never divorced. Moore has explained her subsequent marriages during Hughes&#x27; lifetime by saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t care whether I was a bigamist or not, frankly. I mean, my desire to have children was that strong.&quot;

The Texas courts rejected Moore&#x27;s claim of being Hughes&#x27; widow based on judicial estoppel; since Moore had claimed in her divorce from Cramer to have been married to him in 1959 and received a property settlement in that case, her claim that she was married to Hughes at the time was inconsistent with that and would not be accepted. Nevertheless, the Hughes heirs agreed that Moore had had a long-term relationship with Hughes and agreed to a financial settlement with her. Moore described the settlement as &quot;not more than eight figures&quot;; a biography of Hughes implies that the settlement was $350,000.

Moore dated actor Glenn Ford in the early 1970s.

<doc id="1294820" wikidata="Q906113" url="?curid=1294820" title="Feminists for Life">
<text>Feminists for Life of America (FFL) is a non-profit, anti-abortion feminist, non-governmental organization (NGO). Established in 1972, and now based in Alexandria, Virginia, the organization publishes a biannual magazine, The American Feminist, and aims to reach young women, college students in particular.

==Methods==
FFL uses &quot;pro-women&quot; language in order to convince women that abortion is &quot;immoral&quot;. They use the &quot;pro-woman&quot; term as a substitute for &quot;feminist&quot;, while at the same time opposing mainstream feminism. FFL holds that abortion is antithetical to feminism. Pat Goltz argued that the legalization of abortion allowed sexually exploitative men to avoid responsibilities such as paying for child support. FFL argues that abortion comes from gender inequality. In response to Roe v. Wade, Catherine Callaghan made several claims, including that abortion causes bodily injury to women &quot;in a third to a half of the cases&quot;, and that the Supreme Court legalized abortion because they &quot;hate poor and unwed mothers&quot;. Professor Kelsy Kretschmer said these claims are unsubstantiated, but that the FFL uses such claims to undermine the idea that legal abortion is a feminist &quot;victory&quot;.

==History==

===Origins===
Feminists for Life was founded by Pat Goltz and Cathy Callaghan in Ohio in 1972. Goltz and Callaghan met in a judo club on the campus of Ohio State University, where Callaghan was a tenured professor of linguistics. In 1974, Goltz was expelled from the Columbus, Ohio, chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) for arguing that abortion violated feminist principles, although she and Callaghan were not expelled from national NOW membership.

===Mid-1970s===
After five years as president of FFL, Goltz retired. In 1977, organizational management was moved to Wisconsin. The group&#x27;s activities focused on being a presence at both anti-abortion and feminist events, distributing literature, and writing letters to various publications. A national workshop that became an annual conference for anti-abortion feminists was launched during this time. Many members supported both the Equal Rights Amendment and a Human Life Amendment as &quot;complementary in their concern for human life&quot;.

===1980s===
In June 1984, at the annual FFL meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, peace activist Rachel MacNair was elected president of FFL. Out of her office at a crisis pregnancy center in Kansas City, Missouri, she ran FFL for ten years. Under MacNair, FFL began to receive more national exposure through media interviews, involvement in a broad spectrum of anti-abortion issues, and invitations to speak at anti-abortion events. By 1989, FFL was reporting that their research had found statements against abortion that had been made by early feminists. Some of these findings were challenged by specialists in women&#x27;s history, especially in the case of Susan B. Anthony, leading to a public dispute about her views on abortion. During 1992, MacNair also worked toward founding the Susan B. Anthony List as a political action committee working against abortion through electing anti-abortion candidates.

===1990s===
In the 1990s, FFL worked within the anti-abortion movement but they used &quot;pro-woman&quot; language to establish a &quot;feminist&quot; identity separate from both feminists and anti-abortion activists. Professor Laury Oaks noted that, in practice, their actions revealed a &quot;pro-life stance&quot; from which they attacked mainstream feminism. They backed laws which limited access to abortion. FFL did not usually state that their group&#x27;s ultimate goal was to outlaw abortion, but they supported radical activism in Operation Rescue&#x27;s effort to blockade abortion clinics by filing &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs in the 1993 Supreme Court case &quot;Bray v. Alexandria Women&#x27;s Health Clinic&quot;. FFL also supported two attempts in the 1990s to enact a &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion ban, both of which were vetoed by President Bill Clinton.

In 1994–1995 after MacNair stepped down as leader, FFL&#x27;s office was moved to Washington, D.C., and reorganized as a more politically pragmatic operation under Serrin Foster. Foster began in 1994 to visit college campuses where she spoke out against abortion. This effort was expanded in 1996 to a college outreach campaign involving all of FFL. In 1999, the FFL proposed that the Violence Against Women Act should not allow abortions of pregnancies from rape.

===2000s===
In mid-2005, the Woodward Building, which housed the offices of Feminists for Life, the National Organization for Women, and &quot;The Hill&quot; newspaper, among others, closed to be converted into apartments.

===Contraception===
FFL states that its members and supporters &quot;hold a broad spectrum of opinions&quot; about contraception, with FFL taking no official position on the matter. Prominent FFL member Sarah Palin stated in 2006, &quot;I&#x27;m pro-contraception, and I think kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues&quot;.

==&quot;The American Feminist&quot;==
FFL publishes a biannual magazine called &quot;The American Feminist&quot; which includes original and reprinted articles.

==College Outreach program==

In 1994, Foster began to visit college campuses to deliver her speech &quot;The Feminist Case &quot;Against&quot; Abortion&quot;. FFL established a college outreach program in 1996.

For a college audience, FFL designed a promotional campaign that challenged abortion rights advocacy and provided information for pregnant women, not including how to obtain an abortion. FFL members created several kits for student activists, a kit for residential advisers and psychological counselors, a feminist history kit for libraries, and challenging ads for college audiences, in addition to the resources available through FFL&#x27;s website. Two of the eight &quot;Question Abortion&quot; posters offered in 2000 touched upon political issues, one of these saying &quot;No law can make the wrong choice right&quot;. One poster used an image of Susan B. Anthony and an out-of-context paraphrased quote determined two years earlier by FFL historian Mary Krane Derr to be about estate law, not abortion. Other posters recast choice as the &quot;imperative to have an abortion&quot;, or implied that life was better before abortion rights, back when abortion was illegal. Other FFL posters reveal an anti-abortion stance even in case of rape or incest.

One of the goals of the college program is to get members of college campuses to help advocate for student parenting as a way to reduce the prevalence of abortion. This is an example of &quot;common ground&quot; advocacy. Both sides of the abortion issues are coming together in attempt to work together to find solutions for other issues relating to abortion.

FFL believes that there should be daycares on college campuses&#x27;, dorm housing for women with children, and maternity coverage in health insurances. They blame abortion rights activists for failing to secure provisions that would help make motherhood an easier choice for women.

==References to 19th century feminists==
FFL&#x27;s website features what are said to be quotes from several early feminists, some of which have been challenged by specialists in women&#x27;s history.

The quotes attributed to Anthony led to a dispute about her views on abortion. Much of the dispute centered on an anonymous article called &quot;Marriage and Maternity&quot; published in 1869 in Anthony&#x27;s newspaper and signed &quot;A&quot;. Anonymously written articles were common in &quot;The Revolution&quot;, which published a variety of viewpoints. The author of this article used fervent religious language and called abortion &quot;child-murder&quot;. &quot;Pro-Life Feminism&quot;, a book published in 1995 by FFL leaders, said that Susan B. Anthony was the &quot;A&quot; who wrote the article. Ann Dexter Gordon, an academic expert on Anthony, disagreed, saying that Anthony did not sign her writings as &quot;A&quot; and that &quot;many of the ideas expressed in the article clash with her known beliefs.&quot; Another article in &quot;The Revolution&quot; that was signed &quot;A&quot; took issue with one of its editorials, generating a discussion in which the editors referred to its author as &quot;Mr. A.&quot;

FFL cites the writings of Stanton as supposedly opposing abortion, using her image many times on posters, flyers and other media. However, Stanton was a radical activist bent on reforming religious and society norms in order to halt the subjugation of women. She stayed out of the American Medical Association-generated debate about enacting laws against abortion, and she never voiced support for the criminalization of abortion or the restriction of women&#x27;s right to choose. Instead, she advocated that women should always be allowed to choose when to have children, and how many to have – an approach which she called &quot;voluntary motherhood&quot;. She assisted in the defense of poor women who were accused of killing their infants after birth, the most famous case being Hester Vaughn. Stanton was consistent in her belief that every woman should be the sole person to choose whether and how often she participated in childbearing. Stanton herself was a likely practitioner of contraception to enable family planning, and she was an opponent of the Comstock laws restricting education about contraception and abortion. Stanton helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women&#x27;s rights convention, and she was responsible for putting women&#x27;s right to vote on the list of convention demands.

Regarding the 1868 &quot;Child Murder&quot; article in the &quot;Revolution&quot;, from which FFL takes a supposed Stanton quote, Gordon concluded that Stanton was not the author of this article, saying its &quot;flat style&quot; does not match Stanton&#x27;s. Rather, it was likely written by &quot;Revolution&quot; co-editor Parker Pillsbury who used that same style in other articles. Thomas said that Pillsbury performed most of the day-to-day editorial activities for the newspaper because Stanton was away on speaking tours for much of the year, sending in her articles by mail.

==Prominent members==
In 2007, Foster noted that FFL had reached 26,000 members, including the families of women who joined.

During the confirmation hearings for John Roberts, his position on abortion was questioned in light of his wife&#x27;s FFL membership, leading to intensified focus by the media on the group.

Sarah Palin, the first woman to be nominated by the Republican Party for Vice President of the United States and the first female governor of Alaska, has been a FFL member since 2006.

==Susan B. Anthony birthplace house==

Carol Crossed, founder of the New York chapter of Democrats for Life of America and former board member of FFL&#x27;s New York chapter, purchased the Adams, Massachusetts, birthplace of Susan B. Anthony on August 5, 2006. FFL did not own the Susan B. Anthony birthplace, which was opened as the Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum on February 14, 2010. Its mission states, &quot;The Museum will highlight the familial and regional influences which shaped Ms. Anthony&#x27;s early life, by displaying the textiles and furnishings of that period, as well as the literature and other memorabilia associated with her later career&quot;. The birthplace is managed by The Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum, a non-profit corporation.

== Criticism ==
FFL&#x27;s anti-abortion positions have been criticized by other feminists. Katha Pollitt, columnist for &quot;The Nation&quot;, argues that FFL seeks to make abortion illegal in all cases, including those of rape, incest, health, major fetal defects, and &quot;even some abortions most doctors would say were necessary to save the woman&#x27;s life&quot;.

FFL supported the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting Students Act, which was criticized by writer Emily Bazelon in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; as a &quot;largely hollow &#x27;message bill&#x27;&quot;. Bazelon opined that the 10 million dollars provided by the bill would be &quot;paltry&quot; when spread nationwide. Bazelon quoted Frances Kissling, leader of the abortion rights organization Catholics for a Free Choice, as calling the bill &quot;not serious&quot;, and adding that &quot;if we support these message bills that don&#x27;t really give women much help, then the real message we send is that we&#x27;re not strongly committed to women&quot;.

Some commentators have criticized FFL for not promoting contraception. Katha Pollitt says that she asked Serrin Foster about it, and that Foster replied in part that the Pill did not work for teenagers, which Pollitt said was a belief she knew to be false. Feminist scholar Laury Oaks pointed out that FFL&#x27;s silence on the subjects of contraception and safer sex &quot;fails to address some of the most critical sexual and reproductive issues for women and presents views on pregnancy that cannot encompass the reality of many women&#x27;s experiences&quot;.

<text>Anthony Peter Hatch (born 30 June 1939) is an English composer for musical theatre and television. He is also a songwriter, pianist, arranger and producer.

==Early life and early career==
Hatch was born in Pinner, Middlesex. Encouraged by his musical abilities, his mother – also a pianist – enrolled him in the London Choir School in Wansunt Road, Bexley, Kent when he was 10. Instead of continuing at the Royal Academy of Music, he left school in 1955 and found a job with Robert Mellin Music in London&#x27;s Tin Pan Alley.

Not long after working as a tea boy, Hatch was writing songs (under the name Mark Anthony) and entered the recording industry when he joined The Rank Organisation&#x27;s new subsidiary Top Rank Records; there he worked for future Decca Records A&amp;R man Dick Rowe. While he served his National Service, he became involved with the Band of the Coldstream Guards.

On his return in 1959, Hatch began producing Top Rank artists such as Bert Weedon, the then unknown Adam Faith (&quot;Ah, Poor Little Baby&quot;), Josh MacRae (together with MacRae&#x27;s early recordings with Scottish folk trio the Reivers), Jackie Dennis, &quot;Carry On&quot; comedy actor Kenneth Connor, and the Knightsbridge Strings, and started his own recording career with a cover version of Russ Conway&#x27;s piano instrumental &quot;Side Saddle&quot;. Although he used his real name Tony Hatch as a performer and producer, through about 1964 virtually all his compositions were credited to Mark Anthony.

In 1960, Garry Mills&#x27;s recording of the Mark Anthony composition &quot;Look for a Star&quot;, featured in the film &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot;, became a Top Ten hit in the UK for Top Rank. Four versions of the song charted simultaneously in the United States, including Mills&#x27;s original and a version by &quot;Garry Miles&quot; (a recording alias of future member of the Crickets, Buzz Cason). Top Rank, despite some worldwide success with artists such as Jack Scott and the Fireballs, ultimately failed because of an unusual distribution arrangement with EMI.

A swift succession of events ensued through 1961 that Top Rank was sold to EMI, briefly operated as a subsidiary, with hits by John Leyton, and shuttered, with its artists transferred to other EMI labels. Hatch moved on to a part-time job with Pye Records, where he assisted his new mentor, Alan A. Freeman, with the recording of &quot;Sailor&quot;, a number 1 hit for Petula Clark.

As Mark Anthony, Hatch continued to write songs for Pye artists, including &quot;Messing About on the River&quot; for Josh MacRae. In 1963, Philadelphia teen idol Bobby Rydell hit the charts with &quot;Forget Him&quot; written and produced by Hatch (still writing as Mark Anthony); Hatch produced, arranged and wrote for other American stars such as Chubby Checker, Connie Francis, Pat Boone, Big Dee Irwin and Keely Smith. In 1963 he wrote (under the pseudonym of Fred Nightingale) the Searchers&#x27; hit &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;. By mid-1964, Hatch finally began using his own name as a composer regularly, with Tony Hatch being the credited composer of many of Petula Clark&#x27;s biggest mid-1960s hits, including &quot;Downtown&quot;, &quot;I Know a Place&quot;, and &quot;Sign of the Times&quot;, among others. In February 1964, Hatch&#x27;s composition &quot;I Love the Little Things&quot; won the BBC&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; contest, beating out the other five songs performed by Matt Monro; thus becoming the UK&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest 1964&quot;, where it placed second. The single of the track failed to reach the UK singles chart.

In November 1965, Hatch performed with David Bowie (then known as Davy Jones) in the band the Lower Third, in an unsuccessful audition for the BBC&#x27;s Talent Selection Group. The band were not picked up for broadcast, with one member of the judging panel commenting &quot;I don’t think they&#x27;ll get better with more rehearsals.&quot;

Hatch produced many artists for Pye and other labels including the Searchers, David Bowie, Mark Wynter, the Settlers, the Viscounts, Julie Grant, Gary Miller, Benny Hill, the Overlanders, Roy Budd, the Brook Brothers, Jimmy Justice, the Montanas, Miki &amp; Griff, Emile Ford, Craig Douglas, Bruce Forsyth, Norman Vaughan, Sue Nicholls, the Breakaways, Julie Budd, Buddy Greco, Sacha Distel, Anne Shelton, Sweet Sensation, David Parton, and Graduate among others.

Hatch&#x27;s production of the Searchers&#x27; entire Pye catalogue was significant in that nearly every song was issued in true stereo. The only other UK chart acts with so much stereo were George Martin producing the Beatles and Ron Richards producing the Hollies (although a handful of early Hollies albums were initially issued only in mono).

Hatch also recorded various lounge style albums with his orchestra; he also made solo piano recordings and some tracks as a vocalist.

==Collaboration with Petula Clark==
After &quot;Valentino&quot;, the first of Hatch&#x27;s compositions to be recorded by Petula Clark, he became her regular producer. They collaborated on a series of French-language recordings for Vogue Records. (Clark, whose husband was French and who spoke the language fluently, had a successful career throughout Europe). Hatch became one of her regular songwriting partners, in addition to supplying English lyrics for songs she had composed with French lyricists.

In 1964 Hatch made his first trip to New York City in search of new material for Clark. The visit inspired him to write &quot;Downtown&quot;, originally with The Drifters in mind. When Clark heard the still unfinished tune, she told him that if he could write lyrics to match the quality of the music, she would record the song as her next single. Its release transformed her into a huge international star, topping charts globally early in 1965, and introducing her to the US market. &quot;Downtown&quot; peaked at number two in Britain, stuck behind the Beatles’ &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;. Clark then charted with three consecutive hits written by Hatch: &quot;I Know a Place&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;d Better Come Home&quot;, and &quot;Round Every Corner&quot;, which all charted higher in the US than in the UK. She and Hatch co-wrote &quot;You&#x27;re The One&quot;, which peaked at 22 in Britain but which gave The Vogues a major debut hit in the States. Tony Hatch and Petula Clark became established as the British equivalent of Burt Bacharach and Dionne Warwick. In 1965 Hatch&#x27;s first album under his own name was released. &quot;The Downtown Sound of Tony Hatch&quot;, features instrumental versions of some of his best known songs, along with new compositions.

The song &quot;Call Me&quot;, written for and recorded by Petula Clark in 1965, was recorded by Chris Montez later in the year. Released in November 1965, Montez&#x27;s version entered the US Easy Listening Top 40 in &quot;Billboard&quot; that December, and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in January 1966, peaking that March on the Easy Listening chart at #2 and on the Hot 100 at #22.

Petula Clark&#x27;s run of 1966 and 1967 hits include many written by Hatch: &quot;My Love&quot; (a US number one), &quot;A Sign of the Times&quot;, &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&quot;, &quot;Who Am I&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Sleep in the Subway&quot;, &quot;Colour My World&quot;, and &quot;The Other Man&#x27;s Grass Is Always Greener&quot;. He wrote all of these (except &quot;My Love&quot;) with his wife Jackie Trent. &quot;A Sign of the Times&quot;, &quot;Who Am I&quot; and &quot;Colour My World&quot; were not hits in Britain.

==Collaboration with Jackie Trent and later career==
In 1964, Hatch was hired to write his first television theme, for the soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;. It would become one of his best-known compositions, and was re-worked by Wings. He would continue to write television themes throughout the 1960s, including the themes to &quot;Man Alive&quot;, &quot;The Champions&quot;, and &quot;The Doctors&quot;. When asked to write a song to be featured in the Inspector Rose series, &quot;It&#x27;s Dark Outside&quot;, he supplied &quot;Where Are You Now?&quot;, with lyrics and vocals by a recently signed Pye artist, Jackie Trent. The song immediately clicked with the public and shot to number 1 in the charts.

Although still married to his first wife, Hatch began an affair with Jackie Trent, who had become a frequent songwriting collaborator. This ongoing affair was the inspiration for the song &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&quot;.

Hatch and Trent married in 1967. Their duet &quot;The Two Of Us&quot; reached number three in the Australian charts in 1967 and created a demand for concert and cabaret performances earning the duo the nickname of &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs Music&quot;. The couple also wrote the song &quot;Joanna&quot;, a hit for Scott Walker. One of their more unusual collaborations was the song &quot;We&#x27;ll Be With You&quot; written for Stoke City Football Club in the club&#x27;s successful run for the League Cup in 1972. The song featured the team and supporters and was recorded at the supporters club using Pye&#x27;s mobile studio. The song is still sung by fans as the team runs out on matchdays.

During the 1970s, Hatch and Trent diversified into musical theatre. Their first project, &quot;The Card&quot;, based on Arnold Bennett&#x27;s novel, with book by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, ran in London&#x27;s West End with Jim Dale and Millicent Martin in the lead roles. (Coincidentally, Petula Clark had starred in the 1952 film version with Alec Guinness.) An original cast album was released in 1975. A rewritten version of the show, starring Peter Duncan and Hayley Mills, played the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre in the 1990s and spawned a new cast album. The second Hatch/Trent musical was &quot;Rock Nativity&quot;, with book and lyrics by David Wood. Initiated and produced by Cameron Mackintosh, it first played in Newcastle. An updated version of the show toured nationally in 1976 and was broadcast nationally by Scottish TV. A full-length concert version was recorded at the Cork Opera House for the Irish television state broadcaster RTÉ. In 1972, he composed the original theme to &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;, as well as the themes to &quot;Hadleigh&quot; and &quot;Sportsnight&quot;. During the 1970s Hatch was also a regular panellist on the talent show &quot;New Faces&quot;, where his blunt style of assessing the contestants proved to be a forerunner of approaches to come in later, similar series. In 1975, at the request of Kerry Packer, Hatch and Trent produced the first colour musical television special in Australia.

After completing the music score to the movie &quot;Sweeney 2&quot; (1978), Hatch and Trent moved to Dublin, where they remained for four years, hosting their own TV series, &quot;Words And Music&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s A Musical World&quot;. Hatch continued to produce hit television themes for series such as &quot;Seagull Island&quot; and &quot;Airline&quot; before moving to Australia in 1982. While there, the couple wrote one of their best known compositions, the theme for the television soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

Hatch produced the Original Australian Cast Recording of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Cats&quot; in 1985, whilst serving as the show&#x27;s production musical director.

Hatch and Trent separated in 1995, and divorced in 2002. Trent died on 21 March 2015 in Menorca after a long illness.

==Other later events==
In 2003, a disco remix of the original recording of &quot;Downtown&quot; was released in Australia by &quot;The OUTpsiDE&quot;R with the blessing of both Hatch and Clark. A souvenir CD box set of six of Hatch&#x27;s albums (four from the 1960s and two from the 1970s – including one with Jackie Trent), was released in 2005.

Hatch performed at the Hackney Empire on 9 September 2012, for a Grand Order of Water Rats evening - &#x27;The Golden Years of Variety&#x27;. At the piano he played the theme tunes of &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, and &quot;Crossroads&quot; and encouraged a sing-along to &quot;Downtown&quot;.

On 13 June 2013, Hatch was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, at a ceremony held at the New York Marriott Marquis. He was accompanied by his wife, Maggie. Hatch performed in October 2016 at the inaugural Variety Hall of Fame Awards, with Petula Clark, and hosting &quot;As Heard on TV&quot; on BBC Radio 2 on 1 November 2016.

Hatch was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.

==Family life==
Hatch has two daughters from his first marriage to Jean Matthews. He also has a son and daughter from his marriage to Jackie Trent.
He has two stepchildren with his third wife, Maggie Hatch. He lives in Menorca, Spain, with Maggie.

<doc id="1294827" wikidata="Q343394" url="?curid=1294827" title="İbrahim Tatlıses">
<text>İbrahim Tatlıses (born İbrahim Tatlı in 1952) is a Turkish folk singer and former actor of Arab-Kurdish descent. Since the 1970s he has been one of the best-known and most successful singers of the pop &quot;Arabesk&quot; style. Tatlıses has recorded 42 albums, including notable albums such as &quot;Ayağında Kundura&quot; and &quot;Selam Olsun&quot; and was the host of the highly popular television programme &quot;İbo Show&quot;. He was also a leading actor that appeared in several dozen films, and also has had many business ventures.

==Life==
===Early years===
İbrahim Tatlı was born in Urfa, Turkey to an Arab father and Kurdish mother. His mother tongue is Kurdish and Arabic. He lost his father during childhood and did not attend high school. He did not know how to read or write growing up.

===Musical career===
İbrahim Tatlıses is often regarded as one of the best-known singers of Turkey, being so famous that he has the nicknames &quot;İbo&quot; and &quot;İmparator&quot;. He has had a critically acclaimed and illustrious music career in genres such as Turkish folk music and Arabesk, beginning in 1970 at the age of 18 with his first tape &quot;Kara Kız/Beni Yakma Gel Güzelim&quot;. He sold tapes and sang at weddings/restaurants until a producer discovered him in 1976. The following year his album Ayağında Kundura, featuring songs such as &quot;Ayağında Kundura&quot;, &quot;İndim Gülüm Bağına&quot; and &quot;Kırmızı Kurdele&quot;, was a smash hit and propelled him to fame. Some of his earlier songs have Kurdish origin and were translated into Turkish. From then on, the hit albums came one after another, such as the 1983 album &quot;Yalan&quot;,
the 1985 album &quot;Mavi Mavi&quot;, and the 1987 album &quot;Allah Allah&quot;. He has recorded a total of 42 albums from 1970 to 2014.

===Film and television===
İbrahim Tatlıses has appeared in a total of 37 movies/TV shows, beginning in 1978 with &quot;Sabuha&quot;. In Turkey, well-known singers star in movies with the same name as the album they recently released, and thus the movies include songs from said albums. This is also seen in the 1975 &quot;Ayağında Kundura&quot;, its namesake being his smash-hit album. From there he appeared in numerous movies in the 1980s and 1990s, further cementing his colossal fame as the most famous singer and a quite well-known actor in Turkey. Aside from the cinema industry, Tatlıses hosted the critically acclaimed and highly successful İbo Show, which aired from 1993 to 2011. It was one of the most-watched and loved shows in Turkey.

===Marriages===
Tatlıses married his first wife, Adalet Sara, in Urfa. The couple had three children, a son named Ahmet Salim, and two daughters named Gülşen Sara and Gülden Ferrah. In 1979, he began a relationship with his &quot;Kara Yazma&quot; co-star Perihan Savaş. From his marriage to Savaş, he has a daughter named Melek Zübeyde. Savaş and Tatlıses later got divorced. In 1984, it was reported in the media that claims were made by Savaş that she was beaten for seven hours after being kidnapped by İbrahim Tatlıses, following which she applied to the prosecutor&#x27;s office and asked for his arrest. Tatlıses said in his interrogation by the police, &quot;Savaş is the mother of my child. To let her wander around would make it feel beneath me.&quot; From his relationship with his &quot;Günah&quot; co-star, Derya Tuna, he has a son, named İbrahim &quot;İdo&quot; Tatlıses.

After returning from Germany, Tatlıses married Ayşegül Yıldız on 27 September 2011 in the rehabilitation facility where he was receiving treatment. Mayor of Şişli Mustafa Sarıgül officiated the marriage service, while Fatih Terim was the witness. Together the couple had a daughter, named Elif Ada. They divorced in November 2013.

From his relationship with Işıl Çıtak, Tatlıses had a daughter named Dilan Çıtak, who was born in 1989. He acknowledged and accepted her as his child in 2013. In 2021, he announced his relationship with Gülçin Karakaya, who is 43 years his junior.

===Assassination attempts===
He was shot in the leg in 1990 and survived an assassination attempt in 1998.

On 14 March 2011, he was attacked and seriously wounded in the head. At 00:30 local time, he and his spokeswoman Buket Çakıcı were shot at by unknown assailants after leaving the offices of the private Turkish channel Beyaz TV following his weekly television show. As they entered their vehicle, Tatlises was hit with a bullet that entered the back of his skull and exited through the front. Çakıcı was also hit in the neck, but survived the attack. The perpetrators carried Kalashnikov rifles and escaped in a black car. He was taken to the Acıbadem Hospital in Istanbul for emergency treatment. He was operated on by İlhan Elmacı.He underwent a four-hour operation to have the bullet removed, after which he was in stable condition. He regained consciousness five days later. After a week, the doctors announced that he was recovering well. Turkey&#x27;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited him and also announced that he was recovering well. The police in Turkey arrested around 20 people involved in the attack. On April 7, Tatlıses left Acıbadem Hospital with a police escort and travelled to Atatürk International Airport, where he was boarded the Ministry of Health&#x27;s Hawker 900XP air ambulance for Germany, to receive intensive rehabilitation at the Murnau Trauma Clinic.

===Guardianship===
In June 2022, Tatlıses&#x27;s son Ahmet applied to the court to become his father&#x27;s guardian as he thought his father was not mentally healthy.

===Business===
Tatlıses is involved in the restaurant and tourism businesses, as well as in construction projects with business partner Ali Sarıyıldız in Iraq.

===Kurdish issue===
In the 1980s the Turkish government had banned the use of Kurdish; at a concert in Sweden in December 1986, he had sung folk songs in Kurdish and was thus prosecuted for separatist propaganda, but found not guilty in 1987. The charge was dismissed after he showed regret. In 1988, he was asked by businessman Mehmet Yılmaz at a cultural festival in Uşak to sing a Kurdish folk song, but refused, saying &quot;I am a Kurd, but the laws ban me from singing in Kurdish&quot;. For this, he was indicted on September 19, 1988.

In 1994 there was evidence that Turkish counter-guerrilla organizations targeted Kurdish businessmen, including Tatlıses, İdris Ozbir, Halis Toprak, and Necdet Ulucan. In 1998 it was reported that Tatlıses offered to be an intermediary between the government and the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) during the armed conflict. He recorded a song with Iranian Kurdish musician Abdollah Alijani Ardeshir.

In 2018, he supported the Operation Olive Branch in Afrin laid out by the Turkish Armed Forces against the mainly-Kurdish militia YPG.

<text>Opération Turquoise was a French-led military operation in Rwanda in 1994 under the mandate of the United Nations. The &quot;multilateral&quot; force consisted of 2,500 troops, 32 from Senegal and the rest French. The equipment included 100 APCs, 10 helicopters, a battery of 120 mm mortars, 4 Jaguar fighter bombers, 8 Mirage fighters, and reconnaissance aircraft. The helicopters laid a trail of food, water and medicine enabling refugees to escape into eastern Zaire. Opération Turquoise is controversial for at least two reasons: accusations that it was an attempt to prop up the genocidal Hutu regime, and that its mandate undermined the UNAMIR. By facilitating 2 million Rwandan refugees to travel to Kivu provinces in Zaire, Turquoise set up the causes of the First Congo War.

The charges raised against the French army during Operation Turquoise are of &quot;complicity of genocide and/or complicity of crimes against humanity.&quot; The victims allege that French soldiers did nothing to stop the genocide and let Interahamwe militias escape to Zaire after the massacres. The former Rwandan ambassador to France and co-founder of the RPF Jacques Bihozagara testified, &quot;Operation Turquoise was aimed only at protecting genocide perpetrators, because the genocide continued even within the Turquoise zone.&quot; France has always denied any role in the killing.

== Background ==

On 6 April 1994 Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira were assassinated, sparking the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi. The United Nations already had a peacekeeping force, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), in Kigali that had been tasked with observing that the Arusha Accords were being carried out. Following the start of the genocide and the murder of several kidnapped Belgian soldiers, Belgium withdrew its contribution to UNAMIR, which was commanded by Canadian Roméo Dallaire; Dallaire was prohibited from involving the force in the protection of civilians. By late April, several of the non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) were trying to convince the major powers to agree to a UNAMIR II. As opposed to UNAMIR, which had a peacekeeping mandate under Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter, UNAMIR II would be authorised under Chapter VII to enable the UN to prevent further harm.

The French had provided the Hutu-dominated Habyarimana government with extensive military, and diplomatic support, including a military intervention to save the government during an offensive by the rebel Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in 1990. Immediately after the genocide began, the RPF began another offensive to overthrow the genocidal government and steadily gained ground. By late June, the RPF controlled much of the country and was nearing a complete victory. RPF units carried out retributive attacks within areas they controlled, but they were not of the scale and organization as those carried out in the genocide.

==Implementation==

On 19 June, the French government made an announcement of their intentions to organize, establish, and maintain a &quot;safe zone&quot; in the south-west of Rwanda. At the brink of defeat and retreat, the news of an intervention from their allies was broadcast across the country by the genocidaires, with a consequent increase in their confidence, and the continuation of their hunt for genocide survivors. The French said the objectives of Opération Turquoise were:

On 20 June, France sent a draft resolution to the UNSC for authorization of Operation Turquoise under a two-month Chapter VII mandate. After two days of consultations and the personal approval of the U.N. Secretary General, it was adopted as Resolution 929 (1994), on 22 June, with 10 votes of approval and 5 abstentions. The &quot;multilateral&quot; force consisted of 2,500 troops, only 32 of them being from Senegal and the rest French. The equipment included 100 APCs, 10 helicopters, a battery of 120 mm mortars, 4 Jaguar fighter bombers, 8 Mirage fighters, and reconnaissance aircraft. The helicopters were intended to lay a trail of food, water and medicine. The area that was selected ended up with the result that refugees were enabled to escape predominantly westward, into eastern Zaire. The zone affected by Operation Turquoise was changed after 2 members of a French reconnaissance unit were captured by the victorious RPF rebels and were released in exchange for a revision in the area of Operation Turquoise.

There was an evacuation of the population westward, enforced by the Hutu regime, now set to flee from the Tutsi rebels, after it had been made clear the French were there to provide only a &quot;safe zone&quot;, rather than assistance in the conflict. Unfortunately, there were roadblocks and checkpoints along the way, and the Tutsis left alive, and even Hutus without ID cards, were killed. The outflow of refugees exacerbated the already great numbers of refugees in the region, known as the Great Lakes refugee crisis spilling out of Rwanda, and neighbouring Hutu-Tutsi Burundi, predominantly into Zaire. Approximately, 2.1 million people lived in Zaire in refugee camps. These camps contained the Rwandan state military (FAR) which led to the invasion of Zaire by Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda, known as the First Congo War.

The area of French influence, known as Zone Turquoise, within the Cyangugu-Kibuye-Gikongoro triangle, was spread across a fifth of the country. Although it was meant to save lives and stop the mass killings, killings did occur. When the Hutu government moved the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille-Collines radio transmitter, a key tool in encouraging Hutus to kill their Tutsi neighbors, into the Zone Turquoise, the French did not seize it. The radio broadcast from Gisenyi, calling on &quot;you Hutu girls to wash yourselves and put on a good dress to welcome our French allies. The Tutsi girls are all dead, so you have your chance.&quot; The French did not detain the government officials they knew had helped coordinate the genocide. When asked to explain that in the French parliament, the French foreign minister of the time argued that the UN mandate given to the French contained no authorization to investigate or arrest suspected war criminals. Regardless, French President François Mitterrand claimed that the Operation had saved &quot;tens of thousands of lives&quot;.

The force left as the mandate of the operation expired on 21 August. The RPF immediately occupied the region, causing another refugee outflow.

== Controversy ==
Opération Turquoise is controversial for two reasons: accusations that it was a failed attempt to prop up the genocidal Hutu regime and that its mandate undermined the UNAMIR.

The RPF, well aware that French assistance to the government had helped blunt their 1990 offensive, opposed the deployment of a French-led force. By early June, the RPF had managed to sweep through the eastern half of the country and move south and west, while besieging Kigali in the center. The advance resulted in a massive refugee outflow, though the Hutu government was also implicated in encouraging the flight (&quot;see Great Lakes refugee crisis.&quot;) Regardless, the Zone Turquoise was created in the steadily shrinking areas out of RPF control. The RPF was one of many organisations that noted that the French initiative to safeguard the populace was occurring six weeks after it had become apparent mass killings were occurring in Rwanda. On 22 July, French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur addressed the Security Council, stating that France had a &quot;moral duty&quot; to act without delay and that &quot;without swift action, the survival of an entire country was at stake and the stability of a region seriously compromised.&quot;

In May 2006, the Paris Court of Appeal accepted six courtsuits deposed by victims of the genocide to magistrate Brigitte Reynaud. The charges raised against the French army during Operation Turquoise from June to August 1994 are of &quot;complicity of genocide and/or complicity of crimes against humanity.&quot; The victims allege that French soldiers engaged in Operation Turquoise did nothing to stop the massacres and allowed Interahamwe militias to escape the country in the aftermath. The former Rwandan ambassador to France and co-founder of the RPF Jacques Bihozagara testified, &quot;Operation Turquoise was aimed only at protecting genocide perpetrators, because the genocide continued even within the Turquoise zone.&quot; France has always denied any role in the killing.

UNAMIR Force Commander Dallaire had also opposed the deployment, having sent extensive communication back to U.N. Headquarters that the placement of two U.N.-authorised commands with different mandates and command structures into the same country was problematic. Dallaire was also a strong proponent of strengthening UNAMIR and transitioning it to a Chapter VII mandate, rather than introducing a new organisation. Concern over conflicting mandates led to five countries on the UNSC to abstain in the vote approving the force. The UN-sponsored &quot;Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the UN during the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda&quot; found it &quot;unfortunate that the resources committed by France and other countries to Operation Turquoise could not instead have been put at the disposal of UNAMIR II.&quot; On 21 June, Dallaire replaced 42 UNAMIR peacekeepers from Francophone Congo, Senegal and Togo with UN staff from Kenya after the negative reaction of the RPF to Opération Turquoise. Over the two months of the mandate, there were confrontations, and risk of confrontations, between RPF and French-led units around the zone, during which UNAMIR was asked to convey messages between the two. The UN independent inquiry drily noted that this was &quot;a role which must be considered awkward to say the least.&quot;

<doc id="1294846" wikidata="Q4048920" url="?curid=1294846" title="SUSAT">
<text>The Sight Unit Small Arms, Trilux, or SUSAT, is a 4× telescopic sight, with tritium-powered illumination utilised at dusk or dawn. The full name of the current model is the SUSAT L9A1. The sight is not designed as a sniper sight, but is rather intended to be mounted on a variety of rifles and to be used by all infantrymen. 

Similar devices include the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG), manufactured by Trijicon, and the Elcan Specter.

==Use==

SUSAT was the primary sighting system for the British Army&#x27;s SA80 series weapons. It was also used with L108 and L110 light machine guns, and mounted to L7 and L111 machine guns. It was phased out and replaced by ACOG and ELCAN sight units during mid-life upgrade programmes. As of March 2025 it is still in use with much of the UK armed forces – primarily reserve, rear-echelon and for training use due to budgetary constraints.

It is (or has been) also used by the armies of Cameroon, Oman, Spain and Sweden, in assault rifles such as the Swedish Ak5B and the Spanish CETME LV, although after the replacement of the latter by the HK G36, those sights have been employed in Rheinmetall MG3 machine guns.

A similar unit known as the L2A2 SUIT Sight was used on the L1A1 SLR.

==Reticle==

The reticle of the SUSAT is of unusual design. Unlike the traditional crosshair layouts commonly used, which are in essence a cross intersecting the target, the SUSAT has a single obelisk-shaped post protruding from the bottom edge of the sight. This type of reticle is sometimes referred to as the &quot;German Post&quot;. This obscures the target at long range and the foreground. The reticle is tritium-illuminated for low-light condition aiming. The radioactive tritium light source has to be replaced every 8–12 years, since it gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay.
The L2A2 SUIT Sight uses a similar single post to the SUSAT, but protrudes from the top edge of the sight down to the middle of the field.

==Manufacturing==
SUSAT is constructed from a one-piece, pressure die-cast, aluminium body, into which the eyepiece, objective lens and prisms are fitted as assemblies.

The SUSAT sight was developed in the United Kingdom by Royal Armament Research Development Establishment (RARDE) and is manufactured by United Scientific Instruments and Avimo, now known as Thales Optics.

<text>Natasha Shanta Reid (born May 31, 1981), better known by her Korean name Yoon Mi-rae (), often stylized as &quot;Yoonmirae&quot;, is an American-born based South Korean rapper, singer, songwriter, and producer, who is also a member of Korean hip hop trio MFBTY.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Yoon was born on May 31, 1981, in Fort Hood (now Fort Cavazos) in Texas, to a South Korean mother and an African-American father. Her father had been a radio D.J. while serving with the U.S. military in South Korea in the district of Uijeongbu. Yoon&#x27;s father cites his record collection as an influence to pursue her music career. After she moved to South Korea as a child, she often faced discrimination because of her mixed heritage. Yoon dropped out of school at age fifteen and later took a high school equivalence examination.

===Discovery, Uptown and Tashannie===
Yoon was discovered in 1995 when she accompanied a friend to an audition for a new Korean hip hop group. She did not audition herself, but a World Records representative heard her singing outside of the audition room and signed her to join a new group called Uptown. The group debuted in 1997, when Yoon was 16.

In 1999, she also formed hip hop and R&amp;B duo &quot;Tashannie&quot; with rapper Lee Soo-a, who used the stage name &quot;Annie&quot;. They released one album, called &quot;Parallel Prophecies&quot;. Yoon&#x27;s name, Natasha, was hard for South Koreans to pronounce, so she used the name &quot;Tasha,&quot; in order to better appeal to the intended audience. Uptown broke up in 2000 after several group members were arrested on drug charges. Yoon&#x27;s then-boyfriend, rapper Tiger JK, was also arrested and spent a month and a half in jail. Yoon herself went into hiding during that period.

===Solo career and MFBTY===
Yoon debuted as a solo artist in 2001, under the moniker &quot;T&quot; which she shortened even more from &quot;Tasha&quot;. She released her first album, &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; that same year. Her second album, &quot;Gemini&quot; and her third album, &quot;To My Love&quot;, were released the following year in 2002. In 2006, she joined Jungle Entertainment, a label founded by her now-husband Tiger JK. The following year, she released the album &quot;T3 – Yoon Mi Rae,&quot; on which she shared the difficulties she faced as a mixed-race musician in Korea. That year, she performed in Seoul, South Korea with American singer Amerie, who is also of African and Korean heritage. In 2012, Yoon became the face of the computer brand Hewlett-Packard in Korea, having signed a one-year contract to appear in their print media and radio advertisements. She was also a judge on the third and fourth seasons of the television talent competition &quot;Superstar K&quot;.

Yoon, Tiger JK and rapper Bizzy, formed the hip hop trio MFBTY (My Fans Better Than Yours) in 2013. The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sweet Dream,&quot; ranked #1 on three Korean music charts shortly after its release. They had debuted the song at a concert in Cannes, France. MFBTY signed to Tiger JK&#x27;s newly created Feel Ghood Music label later that year. In September 2013, Yoon earned the #1 spot on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Korea K-Pop Hot 100 list with her song &quot;Touch Love&quot; from the South Korean drama &quot;Master&#x27;s Sun&quot;. In December 2014, Yoon released the single &quot;Angel,&quot; which quickly became #1 on four Korean music charts. Also that month she revealed that the American film &quot;The Interview&quot; used her song &quot;Pay Day&quot; without permission, and that she was taking legal action.

==Personal life==
In June 2007, she married Tiger JK in a private ceremony in a Buddhist Temple. The wedding occurred a month before the death of Tiger JK&#x27;s grandmother who had wanted to see them wed before her passing. Yoon gave birth to their son Jordan Seo in March 2008.

Yoon and her husband are advocates against child abuse. In 2011, they appeared in a photoshoot with their son in &quot;Vogue&quot; Korea for the &quot;Stop Child Abuse &amp; Love Children&quot; campaign. They also filmed a public service announcement for the World Day for the Prevention of Child Abuse, performing at the 2011 Child Abuse Awareness Concert. In 2012, South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Health and Welfare commended the couple for their efforts in promoting child abuse prevention. Yoon has also promoted awareness of multiculturalism within Korean families. In 2008, she volunteered for seven months at a multicultural youth camp.

<doc id="1294851" wikidata="Q6859652" url="?curid=1294851" title="Millimetre of mercury">
<text>A millimetre of mercury is a manometric unit of pressure, formerly defined as the extra pressure generated by a column of mercury one millimetre high. Currently, it is defined as exactly , or approximately 1 torr =  atmosphere =  pascals. It is denoted mmHg or mm Hg.

Although not an SI unit, the millimetre of mercury is still often encountered in some fields; for example, it is still widely used in medicine, as demonstrated for example in the medical literature indexed in PubMed. For example, the U.S. and European guidelines on hypertension, in using millimeters of mercury for blood pressure, are reflecting the fact (common basic knowledge among health care professionals) that this is the usual unit of blood pressure in clinical medicine.

==Definition==
The millimetre of mercury is defined as the pressure exerted by a column of mercury 1 millimetre high with a density of (approximate density at ) at standard gravity (), i.e. precisely pascals.

: 1 mmHg = = (exactly)

The use of an actual column of mercury for precise measurement of pressure requires corrections for the actual gravity at given location (±0.44%) and the density of mercury at the actual temperature (−0.45% at ). 

A torr is a similar unit defined as exactly of a standard atmosphere ( = ), i.e. .

: 1 Torr =  atm =  Pa = 

The torr is about one part in seven million or smaller than the millimetre of mercury; such difference is negligible for most practical uses.

Each millimetre of mercury can be divided into 1000 micrometres of mercury, denoted μmHg or simply microns.

==History==

For much of human history, the pressure of gases like air was ignored, denied, or taken for granted, but as early as the 6th century BC, Greek philosopher Anaximenes of Miletus claimed that all things are made of air that is simply changed by varying levels of pressure. He could observe water evaporating, changing to a gas, and felt that this applied even to solid matter. More condensed air made colder, heavier objects, and expanded air made lighter, hotter objects. This was akin to how gases become less dense when warmer and more dense when cooler.

In the 17th century, Evangelista Torricelli conducted experiments with mercury that allowed him to measure the presence of air. He would dip a glass tube, closed at one end, into a bowl of mercury and raise the closed end up out of it, keeping the open end submerged. The weight of the mercury would pull it down, leaving a partial vacuum at the far end. This validated his belief that air/gas has mass, creating pressure on things around it. Previously, the more popular conclusion, even for Galileo, was that air was weightless and it is vacuum that provided force, as in a siphon. The discovery helped bring Torricelli to the conclusion:

This test, known as Torricelli&#x27;s experiment, was essentially the first documented pressure gauge.

Blaise Pascal went farther, having his brother-in-law try the experiment at different altitudes on a mountain, and finding indeed that the farther down in the ocean of atmosphere, the higher the pressure.

Mercury manometers were the first accurate pressure gauges. They are less used today due to mercury&#x27;s toxicity, the mercury column&#x27;s sensitivity to temperature and local gravity, and the greater convenience of other instrumentation. They displayed the pressure difference between two fluids as a vertical difference between the mercury levels in two connected reservoirs.

An actual mercury column reading may be converted to more fundamental units of pressure by multiplying the difference in height between two mercury levels by the density of mercury and the local gravitational acceleration. Because the specific weight of mercury depends on temperature and surface gravity, both of which vary with local conditions, specific standard values for these two parameters were adopted. This resulted in defining a &quot;millimetre of mercury&quot; as the pressure exerted at the base of a column of mercury 1 millimetre high with a precise density of when the acceleration due to gravity is exactly .

==Use in medicine and physiology==
In medicine, pressure is still generally measured in millimetres of mercury. These measurements are in general given relative to the current atmospheric pressure: for example, a blood pressure of 120 mmHg, when the current atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg, means 880 mmHg relative to perfect vacuum.

Routine pressure measurements in medicine include:
* Blood pressure, measured with a sphygmomanometer
* Intraocular pressure, with a tonometer
* Cerebrospinal fluid pressure
* Intracranial pressure
* Intramuscular pressure (compartment syndrome)
* Central venous pressure
* Pulmonary artery catheterization
* Mechanical ventilation

In physiology manometric units are used to measure Starling forces.

<doc id="1294863" wikidata="Q651278" url="?curid=1294863" title="Dazu Rock Carvings">
<text>The Dazu Rock Carvings () are a series of Chinese religious sculptures and carvings and UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Dazu District, Chongqing, China. The carvings date back as far as the 7th century AD, depicting and influenced by Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist beliefs. Some are in rock-cut cave shrines, in the usual Chinese Buddhist style, but many others are rock reliefs carved into the open rock faces. Listed as a World Heritage Site in 1999, the Dazu Rock Carvings are made up of 75 protected sites containing some 50,000 statues, with over 100,000 Chinese characters forming inscriptions and epigraphs. The sites are located in Chongqing Municipality within the steep hillsides throughout Dazu District, located about 165 kilometers west of the urban area of Chongqing. The highlights of the rock grotto are found on Mount Baoding and Mount Beishan.

==Description==
The Dazu Rock Carvings comprise 5 locations in Dazu District, Chongqing Municipality: Beishan, Baodingshan, Nanshan, Shizhuanshan, and Shimenshan. 
*Beishan (North Mountain) contains two groups of rock carvings and sculptures along a cliff face stretching for 300 meters. These date from the 9th to the 12th century and portray Tantric Buddhist and Taoist themes.
*Baodingshan (Baoding Mountain) includes carvings in a U-shaped valley near the Longevity Pavilion, dating from the 12th and 13th centuries. Stretching for 500 meters, the carved figures depict themes from Tantric Buddhism in addition to secular life.
*At Nanshan (South Mountain), the rock art dates from the Song Dynasty during the rule of the Emperor Shao Xing, depicting Taoist themes and symbols. In addition, there is a stele recording the history of Sichuan after a Mongol invasion in the 13th century.
*Shizhuanshan (Shizhuan Mountain) carvings are dated from the early 12th century, uniquely integrating rock-hewn sculptures and carvings depicting Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism together. The most prominent of the grotto sculptures are thought to have been sculpted by Wen Wijian, a famous sculptor of the time.
*Shimenshan (Shimen Mountain) contains carvings that date from the 12th century, including statues of the Jade Emperor and several gods.

==History==
The technique for rock carvings may have originated in ancient India. The earliest carvings were begun in 650 AD during the early Tang dynasty, but the main period of their creation began in the late 9th century, when Wei Junjing, Prefect of Changzhou, pioneered the carvings on Mount Beishan, and his example was followed after the collapse of the Tang dynasty by local and gentry, monks and nuns, and ordinary people during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–65). In the 12th century, during the Song dynasty, a Buddhist monk named Zhao Zhifeng began work on the elaborate sculptures and carvings on Mount Baoding, dedicating 70 years of his life to the project. Unlike most collections of rock carvings, the Dazu rock carvings include statues representing all three major religions: Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism.

Off limits to visitors for many years, the carvings were opened to Chinese travelers in 1961 and foreign visitors in 1980. Until 1975, there was only a muddy path between the town of Dazu and the main cluster of carvings.

The carvings were listed as a World Heritage Site in 1999, citing &quot;…their aesthetic quality, their rich diversity of subject matter, both secular and religious, and the light that they shed on everyday life in China during this period. They provide outstanding evidence of the harmonious synthesis of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism.&quot;

<doc id="1294870" wikidata="Q3754364" url="?curid=1294870" title="Zebra oto">
<text>The zebra oto or tiger oto (&quot;Otocinclus cocama&quot;) is a fish of the genus &quot;Otocinclus&quot; of the family Loricariidae that originates from Peru.

==Taxonomy==
The zebra oto was described in 2004 from a tributary of the Río Ucayali in Peru. Its closest relatives appear to be &quot;O. huaorani&quot;, &quot;O. bororo&quot;, &quot;O. mariae&quot;, and &quot;O. mura&quot;, as well as the more recently described species &quot;O. batmani&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
This fish is found in Peru in the Ucayali River and possibly Marañón River as well. These fish are found in mid-sized creeks with clear water. It may also be found in small ponds. They associate with marginal vegetation.

==Appearance and anatomy==
The zebra oto has a general body-shape like other &quot;Otocinclus&quot; species. They are small, have a suckermouth, and have armor on their bodies.

The zebra oto can be distinguished from all other members of this genus by its vertical stripe-like blotches and its complete lateral line. The zebra oto has the highest number of teeth of any species of &quot;Otocinclus&quot;. The W mark on its caudal fin distinguishes this fish from all others except for &quot;O. batmani&quot;. The zebra oto reaches about 4.4 cm (1.7 in) in SL, though the males are smaller.

== Status ==
The zebra oto is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to its limited range and overexploitation for the aquarium trade. Additionally, it is not protected in any part of its range, nor is it listed on CITES. The species has a decreasing population trend in the wild.

==In the aquarium==
The zebra oto has been for sale in the aquarium trade since the early 1990s. It has been popular since at least 2000. They are an occasionally seen species, and are bred in Asia in good numbers.

<doc id="1294877" wikidata="Q4718876" url="?curid=1294877" title="Alexander Forbes (bishop of Brechin)">
<text>Alexander Penrose Forbes (16 June 18178 October 1875) was a Scottish Episcopalian divine, born in Edinburgh. A leading cleric in the Scottish Episcopal Church, he was Bishop of Brechin from 1847 until his death in 1875.

==Biography== 

He was the second son of John Hay Forbes, Lord Medwyn, a judge of the court of session, and grandson of Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet of Pitsligo. He studied first at the Edinburgh Academy, then for two years under the Rev. Thomas Dale the poet, in Kent, passed one session at Glasgow University in 1831 and, having chosen the career of the Indian Civil Service, completed his studies with distinction at the East India Company College. In 1836 he went to Madras and secured early promotion, but in consequence of ill health, he was obliged to return to England. In 1840, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, where in 1841 he obtained the Boden Sanskrit scholarship. He graduated with a B.A. in 1844.

He was at Oxford during the early years of the movement known as Tractarianism, and was powerfully influenced by association with John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey, and John Keble. This led him to resign his Indian appointment. In 1844 he was ordained deacon and priest in the Church of England, and held curacies at Aston Rowant and St Thomas&#x27;s, Oxford; but being naturally attracted to the Episcopal Church of his native land, then recovering from long depression, he removed in 1846 to Stonehaven, the chief town of Kincardineshire. The same year, however, he was appointed to the vicarage of St Saviour Church, Richmond Hill, Leeds, a church founded to preach and illustrate Tractarian principles.

On 28 October 1847 Forbes was consecrated to succeed Bishop Moir in the see of Brechin. He removed the episcopal residence to Dundee, where he resided till his death, combining the pastoral charge of the congregation with the duties of the see. When he came to Dundee the churchmen were accustomed owing to their small numbers to worship in a room over a bank. Through his energy, several churches were built, among them the pro-cathedral of St Paul&#x27;s.

He was prosecuted in the Church courts for heresy, the accusation being founded on his primary charge, delivered and published in 1857, in which he set forth his views on the Eucharist. Keble wrote in his defence, and was present at his trial at Edinburgh. Forbes made a powerful defence but was censured for erroneous teaching. He was a good scholar, a scientific theologian and a devoted worker, and was much loved. He died at Dundee on 8 October 1875.

Forbes&#x27; younger brother George Hay Forbes was also a member of the Episcopalian clergy, patristics scholar and editor. Bishop Forbes&#x27; correspondence is held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee as part of the Brechin Diocesan Library Manuscripts Collection. This collection includes correspondence with E. B. Pusey and William Gladstone.

St Drostan&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Tarfside, Glen Esk, was built in 1879 in memory of Bishop Forbes.

The following April, the Dolphins used the third-round draft choice acquired from the Bears on Florida linebacker Channing Crowder, who developed into a productive starter for Miami during his 6 years.

===Miami Dolphins===
Booker started 15 games during his first season with the Dolphins in 2004. He finished third on the team with 50 receptions for 638 yards and a touchdown, behind fellow wide receiver Chris Chambers and tight end Randy McMichael.

Booker tossed a 48-yard completion to Chambers against the St. Louis Rams on October 24 for the third and longest completion of his career. That led to a Sammy Morris eight-yard touchdown run on the next play from scrimmage for the Dolphins’ first score of a game they went on to win, 31–14, as they earned their initial victory of the season. He was inactive for finale at the Baltimore Ravens on January 2, 2005, with an ankle injury.

He caught 39 passes for 686 yards and three touchdowns on the season. His reception total ranked third on the team, behind Chris Chambers and Randy McMichael while his yardage figure was second (behind only Chambers).

Booker accounted for a pair of 100-yard receiving games on the year, including the season opener against the Denver Broncos when he hauled in five passes for 104 yards. Included in that total was a 60-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Gus Frerotte - the second-longest pass play by the Dolphins in 2005. It was also Booker&#x27;s fourth career catch of 60 yards or longer and his longest since he had a 61-yard touchdown catch on December 7, 2003, at Green Bay as a member of the Chicago Bears. He had five catches for 102 yards against the New England Patriots on November 13, marking the first time since 2002 that he had two or more 100-yard receiving games in the same season.

Booker started 14 games during the season and was inactive twice - on December 25 against the New York Jets due to an ankle injury and on October 15 at the New York Jets due to a chest injury.

A projected starter in 2007, it was reported on April 26 that Booker was on the trade bloc.

However, Booker remained with the Dolphins as their No. 2 receiver behind Chris Chambers, with the team trying to work rookie first round pick Ted Ginn Jr. and Derek Hagan more into the offense.

Following a disastrous start to the season for the Dolphins, Chris Chambers was traded on October 16 to the Chargers for their second round draft pick in 2008. Booker then became the only experienced receiver for rookie QB John Beck and career back-up Cleo Lemon to throw to for the rest of the season.

===Chicago Bears (second stint)===

===Atlanta Falcons===
Booker signed with the Atlanta Falcons on August 6, 2009, after the team waived undrafted rookie wide receiver Bradon Godfrey. Booker became an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2009 season.

<text>The fourth USS &quot;Columbia&quot; (C-12/CA-16) was a protected cruiser in the United States Navy during the Spanish–American War and World War I. She was the lead ship of her class of two cruisers; her sister ship was . The class was originally designed with three funnels; however, &quot;Columbia&quot; was built with four and &quot;Minneapolis&quot; with two. This may have been to make them resemble specific passenger liners.

&quot;Columbia&quot; was launched 26 July 1892 by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Company, Philadelphia; sponsored and christened by Miss Edith H. Morton, daughter of Vice President Levi P. Morton; and commissioned 23 April 1894, Captain George Watson Sumner in command.

==Service history==

&quot;Columbia&quot; joined the North Atlantic Squadron, and from 30 July 1894 to 5 January 1895 cruised to protect American interests in the Caribbean. She participated in the intervention in Nicaragua from July to August 1894. She visited Europe in the summer of 1895 and represented the United States at the ceremonial opening of the Kiel Canal in June. Returning to the east coast in August, she operated in the western Atlantic until going in ordinary, in reserve at Philadelphia Navy Yard 13 May 1897.

On 28 April 1896 passenger steamer () struck the anchored ship at Newport News, Virginia and sank. Wyanoke had 107 passengers and 42 crew on board, of which two passengers and 1 crewman drowned, and one crewman died of injuries in the hospital.

Recommissioned 15 March 1898 for service in the Spanish–American War, &quot;Columbia&quot; patrolled along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies until 26 August. She convoyed troops to Puerto Rico and aided in its occupation between July and 14 August. &quot;Columbia&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Philadelphia Navy Yard 31 March 1899.

Following recommissioning on 31 August 1902, &quot;Columbia&quot; served as receiving ship at New York and from 9 November 1903 as a part of the Atlantic Training Squadron. Once more out of commission at Philadelphia between 3 May 1907 and 22 June 1915, the cruiser then joined the Submarine Flotilla as flagship. After cruising between the various Atlantic submarine bases on inspection tours, she was detached 19 April 1917.

&quot;Columbia&quot; patrolled off the Delaware Breakwater from 21 April 1917 as flagship of Squadron 5, Patrol Force until July when she joined the Cruiser Force as a convoy escort. Between 1 January and 13 November 1918 she made five Atlantic escort voyages, protecting the passage of men and supplies for the American Expeditionary Force in France. On her detachment 7 January 1919, she became flagship of Squadron 2, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, operating along the East Coast and in the Caribbean. She was relieved as flagship on 29 May but continued cruising until decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard 29 June 1921.

Reclassified CA-16 on 17 July 1920, she was renamed &quot;Old Columbia&quot; 17 November 1921, and sold 26 January 1922.

<doc id="1294888" wikidata="Q5104045" url="?curid=1294888" title="Glasser's choice theory">
<text>The term &quot;choice theory&quot; is the work of William Glasser, MD, author of the book so named, and is the culmination of some 50 years of theory and practice in psychology and counselling.

==Characteristics==
Choice theory posits that the behaviors we choose are central to our existence. Our behavior (choices) is driven by five genetically driven needs in hierarchical order: survival, love, power, freedom, and fun.

The most basic human needs are survival (physical component) and love (mental component). Without physical (nurturing) and emotional (love), an infant will not survive to attain power, freedom, and fun.

&quot;No matter how well-nourished and intellectually stimulated a child is, going without human touch can stunt his mental, emotional, and even physical growth&quot;.

Survival needs include:
* Food
* Clothing
* Shelter
* Breathing
* personal safety
* security and sex, having children
And four fundamental psychological needs:
* Belonging/connecting/love
* Power/significance/competence
* Freedom/autonomy
* Fun/learning

Choice theory suggests the existence of a &quot;quality world.&quot; The idea of a &quot;quality world&quot; in choice theory has been compared to Jungian archetypes, but Glasser&#x27;s acknowledgement of this connection is unclear. Some argue that Glasser&#x27;s &quot;quality world&quot; and what Jung would call healthy archetypes share similarities.

Our &quot;quality world&quot; images are our role models of an individual&#x27;s &quot;perfect&quot; world of parents, relations, possessions, beliefs, etc. How each person&#x27;s &quot;quality world&quot; is somewhat unusual, even in the same family of origin, is taken for granted.

Starting from birth and continuing throughout our lives, each person places significant role models, significant possessions, and significant systems of belief (religion, cultural values, icons, etc.) into a mostly unconscious framework Glasser called our &quot;quality world&quot;. The issue of negative role models and stereotypes is not extensively discussed in choice theory.

Glasser also posits a &quot;comparing place,&quot; where we compare and contrast our perceptions of people, places, and things immediately in front of us against ideal images (archetypes) of these in our quality world framework. Our subconscious pushes us towards calibrating—as best we can—our real-world experience with our quality world (archetypes).

Behavior (&quot;total behavior&quot; in Glasser&#x27;s terms) is made up of these four components: acting, thinking, feeling, and physiology. Glasser suggests we have considerable control or choice over the first two of these, yet little ability to directly choose the latter two as they are more deeply sub- and unconscious. These four components remain closely intertwined, and the choices we make in our thinking and acting will greatly affect our feelings and physiology.

Glasser frequently emphasizes that failed or strained relationships with significant individuals can contribute to personal unhappiness. spouses, parents, children, friends, and colleagues.

The symptoms of unhappiness are widely variable and are often seen as mental illnesses. Glasser believed that &quot;pleasure&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; are related but far from synonymous. Sex, for example, is a &quot;pleasure&quot; but may well be divorced from a &quot;satisfactory relationship,&quot; which is a precondition for lasting &quot;happiness&quot; in life. Hence the intense focus on the improvement of relationships in counseling with choice theory—the &quot;new reality therapy&quot;. Individuals who are familiar with both reality therapy and choice theory may have a preference for the latter, which is considered a more modern approach.

According to choice theory, mental illness can be linked to personal unhappiness. Glasser champions how we are able to learn and choose alternate behaviors that result in greater personal satisfaction. Reality therapy is a choice theory-based counseling process focused on helping clients learn to make those self-optimizing choices.

== The Ten Axioms of Choice ==
# The only person whose behavior we can control is ourselves.
# All we can give another person is information.
# All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems.
# The problem relationship is always part of our present life.
# What happened in the past has everything to do with who we are today, but we can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in the future.
# We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our quality world.
# All we do is behave.
# All behavior is total behavior and is made up of four components: acting, thinking, feeling, and physiology.
# All of our total behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can only control our feelings and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think.
# All total behavior is designated by verbs and named by the part that is the most recognizable.

== In Classroom Management ==
William Glasser&#x27;s choice theory begins: Behavior is not separate from choice; we all choose how to behave at any time. Second, we cannot control anyone&#x27;s behavior but our own. Glasser emphasized the importance of classroom meetings as a means to improve communication and solve classroom problems. Glasser suggested that teachers should assist students in envisioning a fulfilling school experience and planning the choices that would enable them to achieve it.

For example, Johnny Waits is an 18-year-old high school senior and plans on attending college to become a computer programmer. Glasser suggests that Johnny could be learning as much as he can about computers instead of reading Plato. Glasser proposed a curriculum approach that emphasizes practical, real-world topics chosen by students based on their interests and inclinations. This approach is referred to as the quality curriculum. The quality curriculum places particular emphasis on topics that have practical career applications. According to Glasser&#x27;s approach, teachers facilitate discussions with students to identify topics they are interested in exploring further when introducing new material. In line with Glasser&#x27;s approach, students are expected to articulate the practical value of the material they choose to explore.

==Education==
Glasser did not endorse Summerhill, and the quality schools he oversaw typically had conventional curriculum topics. The main innovation of these schools was a deeper, more humanistic approach to the group process between teachers, students, and learning.

== Critiques ==
In a book review, Christopher White writes that Glasser believes everything in the DSM-IV-TR is a result of an individual&#x27;s brain creatively expressing its unhappiness. White also notes that Glasser criticizes the psychiatric profession and questions the effectiveness of medications in treating mental illness. White points out that the book does not provide a set of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the success of Glasser&#x27;s teachings.

<doc id="1294890" wikidata="Q3574509" url="?curid=1294890" title="Zach Thomas">
<text>Zachary Michael Thomas (born September 1, 1973), nicknamed &quot;Baby Elephant&quot;, is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons. He played college football for the Texas Tech Red Raiders, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. He was selected in the fifth round, 22nd pick (154th overall), in the 1996 NFL draft by the Miami Dolphins, and played for the Dolphins in his first 12 seasons in the NFL, before playing his 13th and final season with the Dallas Cowboys.

In his rookie year in 1996, Thomas was voted the Dolphins Team Newcomer of the Year, and also won his first of two Dolphins Team MVP awards (1996, 2001). He was also named the AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1996. Thomas was also the first Dolphins player to win the Dolphins Team Leadership Award (voted by his teammates) a record three times (1998–1999, 2005), until Jason Taylor surpassed him with four (2002, 2006–2007, 2009).

From 1998 to 2006, Thomas led a defensive unit that finished top 10 in total defense in seven consecutive seasons (1998–2004), and in eight out of nine (2006). In five of those nine seasons (1998, 2000, 2002–2003, 2006), Thomas&#x27; defenses finished top five in total scoring defense, including 1st overall in 1998.

Thomas is also known for his longevity with the Dolphins, and currently is 2nd all time in Dolphins history for most games played by a defensive player in the team&#x27;s history with 168, behind Taylor&#x27;s 204. A seven-time Pro Bowl selection (the most ever by a Dolphins defensive player), and seven-time first (5) or second (2) team All-Pro, Thomas recorded more than 1,700 combined tackles (1,100+ solo) in his career which included leading the league in tackles twice (2002, 2006), topping at least 100 combined tackles (he topped 150+ tackles six times) in 10 out of his 12 seasons with the Dolphins, and currently ranks 6th on the NFL&#x27;s all-time career tackles list. He was named a two-time NFL Alumni Linebacker of the Year (1998, 2006), and was also selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team.

In 2006, Thomas was inducted into the Texas Tech Athletics Hall of Fame, and would later be enshrined into the Texas Tech Red Raiders Ring of Honor in 2016. In 2015, Thomas was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. In 2012, Thomas was enshrined into the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll, and on February 9, 2023, in his 10th year of eligibility and in his 4th straight year being a finalist, Zach Thomas was elected as a member to the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2023.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Pampa, Texas. He attended White Deer Schools in White Deer, Texas, until he was a sophomore then transferred to Pampa High School in his junior year. He was a standout high school football player and was named a first-team all-state selection as a senior. Thomas and his older brother, Bart, were high school teammates at White Deer High School in White Deer, Texas; in 1988, Thomas&#x27; freshman year, the White Deer team went 16–0 and won the Class 1A state championship.

==College career==
Thomas attended Texas Tech University, where he was a three-year starter at linebacker for the Texas Tech Red Raider football team. As a junior in 1994, he was a second-team All-American. As a senior in 1995, he was a unanimous first-team All-American, the Big 12 Conference Defensive Player of the Year, and a finalist for the Butkus Award. Thomas is one of 5 Red Raiders to be named a Unanimous All-American along with Mark Bounds, Byron Hanspard, Michael Crabtree, and Jace Amaro. He recorded 390 tackles, including a career-high 131 tackles and a school-record 20 tackles against Georgia in his senior season. Thomas and his brother Bart were the only pair of brothers to be named first-team All-Southwest Conference selections in the same year.

Thomas&#x27; most memorable college game for Texas Tech, occurred on October 7, 1995, against rival Texas A&amp;M University. Texas A&amp;M entered the game riding a five-game winning streak against Texas Tech dating back to 1990. In a defensive 7–7 tie ballgame heading late into the 4th quarter, Thomas intercepted a pass and returned it 25 yards for a touchdown with :34 seconds remaining, helping Texas Tech snap their five-game losing streak to Texas A&amp;M, winning by a final score of 14–7. Thomas finished the game with 12 combined tackles, one fumble recovery, and the game-clinching interception return for a touchdown.

Thomas was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Professional career==
Thomas attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, but had a performance that was described as lousy and included a 28.5&quot; vertical jump. Miami Dolphins&#x27; special teams coordinator, Mike Westhoff, was sent to Texas by the Dolphins to meet with Thomas and scout him for their special teams unit. Thomas was considered to be too small and not fast or athletic enough to play at the professional level according to scouts and draft experts.

===Miami Dolphins===
The Miami Dolphins selected Thomas in the fifth round (154th overall) of the 1996 NFL draft. Thomas was the 18th linebacker drafted in a linebacker class that included Ray Lewis, Tedy Bruschi, Donnie Edwards, and Kevin Hardy. Thomas was the second linebacker the Dolphins drafted in 1996, joining their fourth round pick Baylor linebacker LaCurtis Jones (126th overall). Thomas was initially drafted to join special teams after the Miami Dolphins&#x27; special teams coordinator Mike Westhoff recommended him to head coach Jimmy Johnson.

====1996====
On July 3, 1996, the Miami Dolphins signed Thomas to a three-year, $577,000 contract at the league minimum. He impressed the Dolphins&#x27; coaching staff during training camp and quickly rose up the depth chart to compete for the job as the starting middle linebacker against Jack Del Rio. Head coach Jimmy Johnson officially named Thomas the starting middle linebacker to begin the regular season. On August 3, 1996, the Miami Dolphins subsequently released Del Rio due to the sudden emergence of Thomas.

He made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the Miami Dolphins&#x27; season-opener at home, against the New England Patriots and made nine combined tackles and his first career sack in their 24–10 victory. Thomas made his first career tackle on Patriots&#x27; running back Curtis Martin and made his first career sack on Patriots&#x27; quarterback Drew Bledsoe for a six-yard loss in the first quarter. The following week, he collected a season-high 15 combined tackles as the Dolphins defeated the Arizona Cardinals 38–10. In Week 6, he collected 12 combined tackles in the Dolphins&#x27; 22–15 loss against the Seattle Seahawks. On October 13, 1996, Thomas recorded 11 combined tackles, a sack, and made his first career interception during a 21–7 win at the Buffalo Bills in Week 7. Thomas made his first career interception off a pass by Bills&#x27; quarterback Jim Kelly, that was originally intended for tight end Lonnie Johnson, and returned it for an 11-yard gain in the first quarter. On November 17, 1996, Thomas made eight combined tackles and returned an interception for his first career touchdown in the Dolphins&#x27; 23–20 win against the Houston Oilers in Week 12. Thomas intercepted a pass by Oilers&#x27; quarterback Chris Chandler, that was intended for tight end Frank Wycheck, and returned it for a 26-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Thomas finished his rookie season in 1996 with 153 combined tackles, three interceptions, and two sacks, while starting all 16 games. Thomas was a 1997 Pro Bowl alternate and an All-Rookie selection in 1996.

====1997====
On August 4, 1997, Thomas sustained a fractured fibula during the Dolphins&#x27; 38–19 win against the Denver Broncos in their preseason-opener. His injury sidelined him for the remainder of the preseason and he was also inactive for the Miami Dolphins&#x27; 16–10 season-opening victory against the Indianapolis Colts. Head coach Jimmy Johnson named Thomas the starting middle linebacker upon his return from injury. He started alongside outside linebackers Anthony Harris and Derrick Rodgers. In Week 4, he collected a season-high 12 combined tackles and made an interception during a 31–21 loss at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On October 27, 1997, Thomas tied his season-high of 12 combined tackles in the Dolphins&#x27; 36–33 loss at the Chicago Bears in Week 9. He finished the 1997 season with a total of 127 combined tackles, an interception, and was credited with half a sack in 15 games and 15 starts.

The Miami Dolphins finished second in the AFC East with a 9–7 record and earned a wildcard berth. On December 28, 1997, Thomas started in his first career playoff game and recorded ten combined tackles during the Dolphins 17–3 loss as the New England Patriots won the AFC Wildcard Game.

On February 13, 1999, the Miami Dolphins signed Thomas to a five-year, $22.50 million contract that included a signing bonus of $4.50 million. Thomas&#x27;s $6.5 million in salary and bonus made him the Dolphins highest paid player, surpassing Dan Marino. Head coach Jimmy Johnson retained Thomas, Robert Jones, and Derrick Rodgers as the starting linebackers in 1999. In Week 15, Thomas collected a season-high 13 combined tackles during the Dolphins&#x27; 12–9 win against the San Diego Chargers.

He was inactive for the Dolphins&#x27; Week 10 loss at the Tennessee Titans due to a groin injury. On November 27, 2003, Thomas made six combined tackles, a pass deflection, a sack, and an interception during a 40–21 victory at the Dallas Cowboys in Week 13. Thomas intercepted a pass by Cowboys&#x27; quarterback Quincy Carter, that was intended for wide receiver Terry Glenn, in the fourth quarter. He finished the 2002 season with 152 combined tackles 
(84 solo), six pass deflections, three interceptions, and a sack in 15 games and 15 starts. Thomas was selected to play in the 2004 Pro Bowl and earned his fifth All-Pro selection in six years.

====2004====
Thomas started alongside Morlon Greenwood and Junior Seau in 2004 after the Dolphins signed Seau during free agency. On November 9, 2004, head coach Dave Wannstedt unexpectedly announced his resignation as the Miami Dolphins&#x27; head coach after they declined and fell to a 1–8 record. Defensive coordinator Jim Bates was promoted to interim head coach for the last seven games of the regular season. Thomas injured his hamstring and was sidelined for three games (Weeks 13–15). On December 26, 2004, Thomas collected a season-high 18 combined tackles (nine solo) during the Dolphins&#x27; 10–7 victory against the Cleveland Browns in Week 16. He finished the 2004 NFL season with 145 combined tackles (85 solo), four pass deflections, and two sacks in 13 games and 13 starts. The Miami Dolphins finished with a disappointing record of 4–12 and the remaining coaching staff was fired after the season.

====2005====
Head coach Nick Saban retained Thomas as the starting middle linebacker in 2005. Thomas started 
the 2005 season alongside outside linebackers Channing Crowder and Junior Seau. He also played under defensive coordinator Richard Smith and linebackers coach George Edwards.

In Week 3, he collected a season-high 16 combined tackles (nine solo), broke up a pass, and made a sack during a 27–24 win against the Carolina Panthers. On October 21, 2005, Thomas made 14 combined tackles (eight solo) as the Dolphins lost 30–20 to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7. His 14 combined tackles against the Chiefs continued his streak of six consecutive games with double-digit tackles. In Week 11, Thomas injured his shoulder and was inactive for the next two games (Weeks 12–13). On December 11, 2005, Thomas recorded 11 combined tackles (nine solo), broke up a pass, and intercepted a pass attempt by Chargers&#x27; quarterback Drew Brees as the Dolphins defeated the San Diego Chargers 23–21 in Week 15. On December 19, 2005, it was announced that Thomas was selected to play in the 2006 Pro Bowl, marking his seventh Pro Bowl selection of his career. He tied for the third most Pro Bowl appearances in club history; this is also the record for most Pro Bowl selections among all defensive players in the Dolphins&#x27; 
franchise history. Thomas finished his tenth season in 2005 with 158 combined tackles (104 solo), three pass deflections, two sacks, and two interceptions in 14 games and 14 starts.

====2006====
On January 23, 2006, the Miami Dolphins hired former Houston Texans&#x27; head coach Dom Capers as their new defensive coordinator. Capers opted to retain Thomas as the starting middle linebacker and named Channing Crowder and Donnie Spragan the starting outside linebackers.

In Week 11, he collected 17 combined tackles (four solo) in a 24–20 victory against the Minnesota Vikings. The following week, he recorded six solo tackles, broke up a pass, and made two sacks on Lions&#x27;quarterback Jon Kitna during a 27–10 victory at the Detroit Lions in Week 12. On December 17, 2006, Thomas recorded a career-high 21 combined tackles during a 21–0 loss at the Buffalo Bills in Week 15. On December 20, 2006, Thomas was selected to play in the 2007 Pro Bowl as part of the AFC Roster. Thomas started all 16 games in 2006 and recorded a career-high 165 combined tackles (103 solo), nine passes defensed, three sacks, and an interception.

====2007====
On January 3, 2007, Miami Dolphins&#x27; head coach Nick Saban resigned from his position to accept the head coaching job with the University of Alabama. Saban resigned after repeatedly denying he would accept the position. The Dolphins hired the San Diego Chargers&#x27; offensive coordinator Cam Cameron. Cameron retained Dom Capers as the defensive coordinator and George Edwards as the linebackers coach. Thomas remained the starting middle linebacker, alongside outside linebackers Channing Crowder and Joey Porter.

He started in the Miami Dolphins&#x27; season-opener at the Washington Redskins and collected a season-high 13 combined tackles (nine solo) and made one sack in their 16–13 loss.
On September 16, 2007, Thomas recorded ten combined tackles and broke up two passes before exiting the game due to a concussion he suffered while tackling Cowboys&#x27; fullback Oliver Hoyte in the third quarter of their 37–10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. 
His concussion rendered him inactive for the next two games (Weeks 3–4). On October 21, 2007, Thomas was involved in a car collision and sustained another concussion during the accident. His repeated concussions caused Thomas to have migraine headaches that lingered until being placed on the injured reserve list. On December 4, 2007, the Miami Dolphins officially placed Thomas on injured reserve after he missed five games (Weeks 8–13) due to his 
repeated migraine headaches. On December 20, 2007, the Miami Dolphins hired Bill Parcells as their head of football operations. Thomas finished the 2007 season with 52 combined tackles (42 solo), two pass deflections, and a sack in five games and five starts.

On January 1, 2008, the Miami Dolphins fired head coach Cam Cameron after a 1–15 record. On February 14, 2008, the Miami Dolphins released Thomas after announcing that he no longer fit into their long-term plans and his contract was terminated. Thomas received offers from the Dallas Cowboys, New Orleans Saints and New England Patriots.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On February 23, 2008, the Dallas Cowboys signed Thomas to a one-year, $3 million contract that included a signing bonus of $1 million. The signing of Thomas surprised media and observers, considering that he didn&#x27;t have the previous experience or the size to play in the Cowboys 3-4 defense. After he joined the roster, the Cowboys traded linebacker Akin Ayodele to the Miami Dolphins to clear space for Thomas to become a starter at inside linebacker. Thomas started alongside Bradie James and outside linebackers DeMarcus Ware and Greg Ellis. In Week 4, he collected a season-high 12 combined tackles (six solo) during the Cowboys&#x27; 26–24 loss to the Washington Redskins. He finished the season with 94 combined tackles (65 solo), three pass deflections, and a sack in 16 games and 14 starts.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
An unrestricted free agent in the 2009 offseason, Thomas agreed to terms with the Kansas City Chiefs on April 11. The one-year contract was worth $2 million.

He suffered a concussion early in training camp and was eventually released on September 5, after not playing in any exhibition games. In October, he filed a grievance against the Chiefs for releasing him without an injury settlement while recovering.

===Retirement===

On May 18, 2010, the Dolphins signed Thomas to a one-day ceremonial contract, officially worth $1, in order to retire as a member of the team.

==Legacy and Honors==


Despite being considered by many pro scouts as undersized, unathletic, and not fast enough to play linebacker at the pro level when he came into the league in 1996, Thomas achieved success in the NFL through his immense work ethic, unwavering dedication, relentless study habits, and his quality leadership. Thomas was one of the most consistent linebackers of his era, playing in a total of 168 games for the Miami Dolphins which currently ranks him 2nd all-time in team history amongst defensive players, behind only Jason Taylor&#x27;s 204 games played.

Thomas currently ranks 6th on the NFL&#x27;s all-time career tackles list with an official 1,734 career tackles. In 12 years with Miami, Thomas&#x27; consistency helped anchor a Miami defense that finished Top 10 in total defense in eight out of his 12 seasons, including seven consecutive from 1998-2004. In five of those eight seasons, Thomas&#x27; defenses finished top five in total scoring defense, including 1st overall in 1998. He was a seven time Pro Bowl selection which is currently the most all-time for a Miami Dolphins defensive player. Thomas was a five time 1st Team All-Pro, two time 2nd Team All-Pro, two time NFL Linebacker of the Year selected by the NFL Alumni association, and was selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team. Thomas won numerous Miami Dolphin team awards, including two team MVP Awards (1996, 2001), and three Dolphins Team Leadership Awards (1998-1999, 2005).

Thomas has been inducted into numerous Halls of Fames in his native &quot;West Texas Panhandle&quot;, which include the Pampa High School Hall of Fame, the Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame, and the Texas High School Sports Hall of Fame.
In 2006, Thomas was inducted into the Texas Tech Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2015, Thomas was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and the following year in 2016, was inducted into the Texas Tech Red Raiders Ring of Honor.

In 2012, Thomas was inducted into the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll alongside his teammate Jason Taylor. He is currently one of two Miami Dolphins (the other being Jason Taylor) where his jersey number (#54), while not officially retired, has not been reissued since his retirement. Thomas became eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the first time in 2014. He would become a semi-finalist for the first time in 2019. He would then reach being a finalist for election the next three years from 2020 to 2022. After being a finalist for a 4th consecutive year in his 10th overall year of eligibility, on February 9, 2023, Zach Thomas was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and was formally enshrined on August 5th, 2023.

<doc id="1294891" wikidata="Q5467466" url="?curid=1294891" title="Force Z">
<text>Force Z was a British naval squadron during the Second World War, consisting of the battleship , the battlecruiser and accompanying destroyers. Assembled in 1941, the purpose of the group was to reinforce the British colonial garrisons in the Far East and deter Japanese expansion into British possessions, particularly Malaya and Singapore. Lack of aircraft to protect Force Z, underestimation of the Japanese armed forces, and the political rather than naval motive for its deployment are blamed for the destruction of the force.

==Background==
===Strategy for Far East reinforcement===

Inter-war British planning for a war against the Empire of Japan sought to defend British interests in China (the &quot;offensive&quot; strategy), and to defend imperial lines of communications, particularly through the Indian Ocean (the &quot;defensive strategy&quot;). Singapore was chosen as the main Royal Navy (RN) base. It put the fleet within steaming range of China. The base was also on the &quot;Malay Barrier&quot;, the eastern forward defence zone for the Indian Ocean, although strictly speaking Singapore was not required to pursue a defensive strategy. In the 1920s the RN could reinforce the Far East fleet from Britain and the Mediterranean Sea to sufficiently pursue the offensive strategy. By the late 1930s, war with Germany and a stronger Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had to be considered; in the event of a European war fewer naval forces would be available for the Far East fleet; reinforcement would arrive incrementally and the total end strength would suffice only for the defensive strategy.

In strategic discussions during 1940, Britain requested naval assistance from the United States in the Atlantic (against Germany) and the Malay Barrier (specifically to Singapore, against Japan) in the event that the United States entered the war. The required US naval forces would come from the Pacific Fleet. The Pacific Fleet was not large enough to fulfill both missions. The Americans had misgivings about deploying the Pacific Fleet to Singapore and chose the Atlantic. The Allies agreed that the Atlantic theatre was paramount and the choice was affirmed at the ABC-1 talks the next year.

Still, the British wanted a naval force at Singapore, which they believed was the only place where the vital Indian Ocean trade routes and the eastern British Dominions could be adequately covered. To accomplish this, American naval forces arriving in the Atlantic would replace British naval forces, freeing British naval forces to redeploy eastwards. In February 1941, the RN planned the creation and movement of the Eastern Fleet to the Indian Ocean and Singapore based on this substitution.

The reinforcement of the Far East by the Eastern Fleet would occur in two phases. The first phase moved, at the earliest possible time, a minimum force into the Indian Ocean able to counter Japanese cruisers engaged in commerce raiding; the first phase would occur early in the Atlantic substitution. The second phase moved the bulk of the Eastern Fleet to Singapore or - if Singapore had fallen - the eastern Indian Ocean after American naval mobilization in the Atlantic was complete. The transfer of the Eastern Fleet was projected to be completed 80 days after the entry of the United States into the war. The basic structure of the plan remained unchanged from February 1941 to early December 1941, although the details were regularly revised.

By August 1941, phase 1 was planned as Force H, joined as soon as possible by the phase 2 battleships, the and s. The limiting factor to forming the full Eastern Fleet was a shortage of cruisers and destroyers. The first British capital ships to arrive in the Indian Ocean were the battleship in mid-September, and the battlecruiser in early October.

===Return to offensive plans===
The United States did not wait to enter the war to become active in the Atlantic. By August 1941, there was sufficient American participation in the Atlantic to make a &quot;peacetime&quot; execution of the British Far East naval reinforcement plan feasible. In September, it was proposed that phase 1 could be made more powerful, and the core of the Eastern Fleet could be in place by January 1942. The shortage of destroyers would prevent the deployment of capital ships beyond the Malay Barrier, but retaining capital ships in the Indian Ocean would free cruisers to operate beyond the Malay Barrier.

With such a powerful force, the RN returned to &quot;offensive&quot; plans against Japan in September. At ABC-1, the United States rejected reinforcing the United States Asiatic Fleet with a US aircraft carrier task force. The new RN plan resurrected the concept. Singapore would be the Eastern Fleet&#x27;s main repair base. Manila, in the Philippines, would be its forward operating base come wartime. It would over-optimistically rely on Royal Air Force (RAF) cover in Malaya, and the major American air reinforcement of the Philippines announced at the Atlantic Conference; the latter factor may not even have been considered by RN strategists.

===British assessment of Japanese intentions===
In July, the Japanese moved into southern Indochina. In response, the British reassessed Japanese intentions from August to early September, which came to a number of conclusions. The Japanese were waiting for the outcome of the German invasion of the Soviet Union before deciding on a northern or southern expansion strategy, but were concentrating resources in anticipation of the former. Malaya was vulnerable due to the Japanese encroachment in Indochina, but was not immediately threatened due to the northern option and the monsoon season, which would prevent amphibious landings on Malaya until February 1942. The assessment was fatally flawed. It underestimated economic factors driving Japanese toward the southern strategy. It also failed to appreciate that the Gulf of Thailand was reasonably sheltered against the monsoon.

As a result, air reinforcement to Malaya was deferred; aircraft went to the Middle East, and to the Soviet Union as aid. Overall, Japan seemed at such a disadvantage that increased military deterrence might still prevent war or delay its onset.

===Selecting &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;===
In late August, Prime Minister Winston Churchill discussed Far East reinforcement with Admiral Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord. Churchill proposed augmenting phase 1 with a . The United States declared its intent to deploy modern battleships to the Atlantic at the Atlantic Conference in early August; this would make a &quot;King George V&quot;-class ship available. Pound favoured keeping the &quot;King George V&quot;s in Britain.

Pound proposed basing the &quot;Nelson&quot;s, the battlecruiser , and an aircraft carrier at Singapore. This would be for deterrent value in peacetime, to be withdrawn to Ceylon on the onset of war; the British believed a wartime fleet at Singapore had to be competitive with a major portion of the IJN. Interestingly, Pound did not envision an aircraft carrier in the Far East until spring 1942.

In meetings on 17 and 20 October, the British Defence Committee formally discussed Far East naval reinforcement in response to the fall of the moderate Konoe government on 16 October. In agreement with August-September assessment of Japanese intentions, Churchill and his cabinet favoured the deployment of a modern battleship for deterrent effect. The RN, as part of its offensive strategy, planned to send the &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot;-class battleships to Singapore, but the &quot;Nelson&quot;s could not deploy. was damaged in the Mediterranean Sea in late-September. Crew leave prevented from deploying until mid-December, and a gun refit scheduled from February to May 1942 was required before she could conduct further operations. With working up, the earliest either could reach the Far East was August 1942. The &quot;King George V&quot;-class was, aside from the &quot;Revenge&quot;s, the only worked-up battleship that could sail east before Spring 1942. On 20 October, the Committee decided to send &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to Cape Town, South Africa. Once at Cape Town, a review would decide whether to send the ship onward to Singapore; this would keep &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; available to respond to an emergency in home waters.

Churchill requested an aircraft carrier for Force Z on 17 October, but nothing came of this; the earliest available carrier would be in November after working up. Contrary to post-war accounts, &quot;Indomitable&quot; was not allocated to Force Z. Neither Admiralty plans during the period, nor the secret session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 19 December concerning the loss of Force Z, nor the 7 December tabulation of current and intended fleet strength in the Far East, allocate the carrier to the Eastern Fleet. The carrier did not receive any orders to this effect prior to grounding in Kingston, Jamaica, on 2 November, at the start of a three-week work-up. Joining Force Z by 8 December would have required no grounding and abandoning the work-up.

==&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; sails to Singapore==
&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and the escorting destroyers , , and , were formed into Force G in Britain; they sailed from Greenock on 25 October 1941. The group was commanded by Admiral Sir Tom Phillips, who had played a major role in shaping naval strategy in the Far East. &quot;Hesperus&quot; was temporarily assigned from Western Approaches Command. Three days later also temporarily joined the escort while &quot;Electra&quot; and &quot;Express&quot; detached to refuel at Ponta Delgada in the Azores. &quot;Hesperus&quot; and &quot;Legion&quot; left Force G the following day with the return of the other destroyers. Force G refuelled at Freetown on 5 November and arrived at Cape Town early on the 16 November.

On 2 November, Churchill was notified that Pound intended to conduct the review agreed upon on 20 October before Force G arrived at Cape Town. Pound never conducted the review. The Admiralty, in accordance with its offensive plans, was committed to the move to Singapore before &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; sailed. On 21 October, the Admiralty informed relevant naval commands that the battleship was on route to Singapore. Once Force G sailed, the Admiralty sought to expedite the transit. On 6 November, Phillips expected to stay in Cape Town for seven days, and arrive at Singapore on 13 December. On 11 November, the Admiralty formally ordered &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to combine with &quot;Repulse&quot; at Ceylon before proceeding to Singapore. The orders also suggested - with reservations from Churchill - that the battleship might abandon its escort in the interest of speed; consequently, Force G remained in Cape Town for only two days. Up to 5 October, Churchill still believed the decision to move &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; beyond Cape Town was still under review, and accepted Pound&#x27;s advice and decisions; Churchill was unaware that the Admiralty had readopted an offensive stance the previous October.

British plans to provide media coverage of the arrival of Force G at Cape Town for propaganda and deterrence were disrupted by the shortened duration of the visit. Interviews of ships crew and visits by photographers were cancelled. Japanese diplomats reported the visit on 19 November; thereafter the Japanese expected &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to arrive at Singapore at the end of November.

Force G departed Cape Town on the afternoon of 18 November. It refuelled at Mauritius and Port T, Addu Atoll on the journey eastwards. It arrived at Ceylon on 29 November and was joined by &quot;Repulse&quot;, and the destroyers and ; the destroyers were transfers from the Mediterranean Fleet. Phillips disembarked and flew ahead to Singapore to meet with local commanders; on 4 December he also flew to the Philippines to meet with American commanders. Force G finally arrived at Singapore on 2 December and was redesignated to Force Z on 8 December at the outbreak of war.

== Air cover == 
Phillips had requested fighter protection before he left and was told it was not possible. However the reply to his request did not make it clear that the reply only applied to the morning of the 10th off Sigora, and he may have had the mistaken impression that fighter protection would not be available generally. And two proposals to provide daylight fighter cover had previously been turned down by Phillips and his staff.

Tim Vigors of No. 453 Squadron RAAF was bitter about the loss: writing &quot;I reckon this must have been the last battle in which the Navy reckoned they could get along without the RAF. A pretty damned costly was of learning …. I had worked out a plan with the liason officer on the Prince of Wales by which I could keep six aircraft over him all daylight hours within 60 miles of the east coast to a point north of Khota Bharu. This plan was turned down by Admiral Phillips. Had I been allowed to put it into effect I am sure the ships would not have been sunk. Six fighters could have made one hell of a mess of even 50 or 60 slow and unescorted torpedo-bombers... As we could do nothing else, we kept virtually the whole squadron at readiness at Sembawang while the fleet was out. I was actually sitting in my cockpit when the signal eventually reached us that the Fleet was being attacked. Phillips had known tht he was being shadowed the night before, and also at dawn that day. He did not call for air support. He was attacked and still did not call for help. Eventually it was the captain of &quot;Repulse&quot; who called for air support just before his ship sunk.&quot; 

Wilfred Clouston of No. 488 Squadron RNZAF and his two flight commanders John Noble MacKenzie and John Hutcheson had formulated &quot;Get Mobile&quot; a plan to provide air cover off the coast during daylight by &quot;leapfrogging&quot; flights up and down the coast using the many airfields available. They presented the plan at an Air Operations meeting but it was rejected out of hand by the naval personnel. 

British air forces in Malaya were insufficient to provide full air cover to Force Z. Poor pre-war forecasts of Japanese intentions caused the deferment of air reinforcement, and by the time war was likely it was impossible to provide sufficient reinforcement in time.

==Final deployment and loss==

Phillips ordered Force Z to sortie on 8 December against Japanese amphibious landings on Malaya in the Gulf of Thailand. &quot;Encounter&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; were out of action with defects and were replaced by the First World War destroyers and . &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were sunk by Japanese aircraft on 10 December 1941, becoming the first capital ships moving at sea to be sunk solely by enemy aircraft.

Phillips also failed to make full use of intelligence resources. As a result, he grossly underestimated the scale of attack, and believed that the majority of enemy attack aircraft would be level bombers rather than land-based naval torpedo bombers.

Edwards opted to retain Gunther Cunningham as Defensive coordinator. Knight and Greg Wesley returned as the starting safeties in 2006. In Week 13, he collected a season-high ten solo tackles in the Chiefs&#x27; 31–28 loss at the Cleveland Browns. He started in all 16 games in 2006 and recorded 83 combined tackles (74 solo), four pass deflections, two sacks, and an interception.

====2007====
On March 22, 2007, the Kansas City Chiefs cut Knight after he declined to restructure his contract.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
On August 13, 2007, the Jacksonville Jaguars signed Knight to a one-year, $820,000 contract. Head coach Jack Del Rio named Knight the starting strong safety to start the 2007 season, alongside rookie Reggie Nelson. In Week 6, he collected a season-high 12 solo tackles and made a pass deflection during the Jaguars&#x27; 37–17 win against the Houston Texans. On November 25, 2007, Knight made two solo tackles, broke up a pass, and made his last career interception off a pass by J. P. Losman during a 36–14 win against the Buffalo Bills in Week 12. He started in all 16 games in 2007 and recorded 93 combined tackles (79 solo), 11 pass deflections, and four interceptions.

The Jacksonville Jaguars finished second in the AFC South with an 11–5 record and earned a wildcard berth. On January 5, 2008, Knight recorded 13 combined tackles (ten solo) during a 31–29 victory at the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Wildcard Game. The following week, the Jaguars were eliminated from the playoffs after a 31–20 loss at the New England Patriots in the AFC Divisional Round.

===New York Giants===
On March 3, 2008, the New York Giants signed Knight to a three-year, $5.15 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $1.25 million. Knight was signed as a replacement for Gibril Wilson who departed during free agency.

Knight entered camp slated as the starting strong safety, but saw competition from Michael Johnson. Head coach Tom Coughlin named Knight the backup strong safety to begin the regular season, behind Michael Johnson. On November 29, 2008, the New York Giants placed Knight on injured reserve due a hip injury. He finished the season with 12 combined tackles (ten solo) in nine games and no starts. On February 9, 2009, the New York Giants released Knight.

<text>Timothy L. Bowens (born February 7, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for 11 seasons with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels, and was chosen with the 20th pick of the 1994 NFL draft by the Dolphins.

The Dolphins were initially criticized for picking Bowens, as he was overweight and had played only nine games in his college career at Mississippi. He had a terrific rookie season in 1994, and Bowens was named &#x27;The NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year&#x27; by the Associated Press. He played with the Miami Dolphins for 11 years before he retired after the 2004 NFL season. He was inducted into the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll on October 27, 2024.

==Early life==
Tim Bowens was born and grew up in Okolona, Mississippi, one of two county seats in rural Chickasaw County. He played football at Okolona High School. He was an All-State pick as a senior and an All-District pick as a junior and senior. As a senior, he led his team to the Class AA semifinals and an 11–2 record. He was also a two-year letter winner in basketball.

<text>Libertarians for Life (LFL, L4L) is a nonsectarian group expressing an opposition to abortion within the context of libertarianism. Based in Wheaton, Maryland, Libertarians for Life believes abortion is not a right, but &quot;a wrong under justice&quot;.

== Views ==
To explain and defend its stance on abortion, Libertarians for Life argues that:

# Human offspring are human beings, persons from fertilization.
# Abortion is homicide – the killing of one person by another.
# There is never a right to kill an innocent person. Prenatally, we are all innocent persons.
# A prenatal child has the right to be in the mother&#x27;s body. Parents have no right to evict their children from the crib or from the womb and let them die. Instead both parents, the father as well as the mother, owe them support and protection from harm.
# No government, nor any individual, has a just power to legally &quot;de-person&quot; any one of us, born or preborn.
# The proper purpose of the law is to side with the innocent, not against them.
None of the arguments are based upon religious belief, and are intended to appeal equally to atheists and theists. This is a point of pride for the group, claiming to rely on science and reason, while both anti-abortion allies and abortion rights opponents use what they view as non-scientific or unreasoned arguments.

== Activities ==
Doris Gordon founded Libertarians for Life in 1976 &quot;because some libertarian had to blow the whistle.&quot; In 1988, the Libertarians for Life unsuccessfully attempted to change the Libertarian Party position on abortion, so it would be similar to the party&#x27;s 1988 presidential nominee, Ron Paul.

<text>David Byron Boston (born August 19, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, earning first-team All-American honors in 1998. Selected by the Arizona Cardinals with the eighth overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft, Boston became a Pro Bowl selection with the Cardinals in 2001. He also played for the San Diego Chargers, Miami Dolphins, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

==Early life==
Boston was born in Humble, Texas, and played youth football in the Humble Area Football League.

==College career==
Boston became a three-year starter for the Ohio State Buckeyes (1996–98). He set several Ohio State receiving records during that time. His 191 pass receptions as a Buckeye was a record and is now the second most in school history (K. J. Hill, 2019). His 2,855 career receiving yards and 1,435 single-season receiving yards were school records until surpassed by Michael Jenkins in 2003 and Jaxon Smith-Njigba in 2021. With 34 career touchdown receptions (and one two-point conversion), Boston averaged 5.89 points per game. Additionally, he held the school touchdown reception record until Chris Olave surpassed it in 2021.

Boston&#x27;s best-remembered moment remains his game-winning five-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Joe Germaine with 19 seconds remaining in the 1997 Rose Bowl.

===College statistics===

==Professional career==

===Arizona Cardinals===
Boston left Ohio State with a year of eligibility remaining, and was selected with the eighth overall pick in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft by the Arizona Cardinals. In 2000, David was an alternate selection for the Pro Bowl. In 2001, Boston had 98 receptions for a league-leading 1598 yards and eight touchdowns, starting in the Pro Bowl and earning All-Pro honors.

===San Diego Chargers===
Boston signed a seven-year, $47 million contract ($12 million guaranteed) with the San Diego Chargers in 2003. That season, he caught 70 passes for 880 yards and seven touchdowns, though head coach Marty Schottenheimer suspended him for a game after he cursed out strength coach Dave Redding. Chargers GM A. J. Smith traded Boston to the Miami Dolphins for a sixth round draft choice.

===Miami Dolphins===
Before the 2004 season, Boston tested positive for a minor HCG infraction and was ordered to serve a four-game suspension. The suspension became moot after he tore ligaments in his knee and was unable to play for the entire season. The Dolphins cut him at the end of the year, then proceeded to re-sign him for the veterans&#x27; minimum in 2005 for $700,000. He played in five games that year before tearing knee ligaments again.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
In 2006, Boston signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was released by the team on September 12, 2007, after being injured.

===Toronto Argonauts===
After spending the 2007 season out of football, Boston signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League on April 21, 2008. Boston reported to training camp but his medical report showed a stress fracture in his right foot and recommended surgery. He was placed on the suspended list, never practicing or playing in the pre-season. A second doctor&#x27;s opinion, however, was that it was a two-year-old injury and cleared him to play in the regular season opener on June 27, 2008, when he recorded two receptions for a total of 16 yards. Following the game, however, Boston reported feeling too much pain and opted to follow the original doctor&#x27;s suggestion of surgery requiring a 10 to 12 weeks rehabilitation period. He never played another down of pro football.

===NFL statistics===
==Personal life==
Boston&#x27;s father, Byron, is an American football official in the NFL. He was not permitted to officiate regular season games in which David was playing. Byron worked as a line judge for one of his son&#x27;s preseason games, between the Cardinals and the San Diego Chargers on August 14, 1999.

On March 27, 2000, David Boston and Na&#x27;il Diggs were traveling northbound in a Hummer on I-71 in Columbus, Ohio. A Ford Escort driven by Danielle Carfagna was traveling the wrong way on the interstate and collided with the Hummer. Boston and Diggs were injured, and Carfagna was killed in the accident. Boston suffered lingering nerve damage from the accident. Police were not able to determine why the woman was driving the wrong way.

On October 19, 2004, Boston was accused of punching a male airline ticket agent who wouldn&#x27;t let him board a plane at an airport in Burlington, Vermont. He pleaded no contest, was fined $500 and paid $211 in restitution.

On August 23, 2007, Boston was arrested in Pinellas Park, Florida and charged with DUI after a failed sobriety test was conducted. Boston was released on his own recognizance.
Boston&#x27;s breath test resulted in a reading of 0.00 BAC. On September 10, 2007, it was released to the media that David Boston tested positive for GHB, a recreational drug that the body produces naturally. After learning of the drug charges the Buccaneers quickly came to an injury settlement with Boston allowing him to be released. On September 12, 2007, Boston was officially released by Tampa Bay when they decided to sign Mark Jones.

<doc id="1294909" wikidata="Q7674974" url="?curid=1294909" title="Tafheet">
<text>Tafheet (), or popularly hajwalah (هجولة), (colloquially known as Arab drifting or Saudi drifting), is a type of street racing-like subculture believed to have started in the late 1970s in Saudi Arabia, that involves driving cars that are generally non-modified or factory-setup (sometimes stolen or rented cars) at very high speeds, around , across wide highways throwing the car left and right to mimic the appearance of drifting. In the process, drivers often drive dangerously close to traffic, barriers, and spectators watching from the roadsides without any protection.

Tafheet driver practice and events are generally seen on the wide sectioned highways of Riyadh, Al-Qassim Province and, less notably, in other parts of Saudi Arabia. In the United Arab Emirates, tafheet are commonly seen on the highways of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, which also feature long straightaways.

Apart from the risk involved for the drivers, the spectators are also at a high risk of injury or possible death. Unfortunately, sometimes the drivers would lose control of their vehicle and drive into other road users, or worse the spectators.

The technique differs from high-speed cornering on tracks as cars drift sideways at high speed and recover with opposite lock. Tafheet practice and events occur with little or no concern for vehicle occupants, other drivers, or spectator safety, and as a result there often are fatal accidents.

==Culture==
Some of the more popular tafheet maneuvers include:

* Akheyat: turning the car 180 degrees from side to another completing a full 360 by starting from the right to the left or opposite, kind of street sweeping
* Harakat Almawt (Death movements): power slides where one must keep the car going on forward in a straight line until the car stops by itself without fixing the steer or going off track
* Sefty: spinning the car a full 360 degrees starting from any side and then spinning the opposite side of the first 360 with a short power slide between
* Ta&#x27;geed: spinning the car a full 360 degrees while driving either straight or sideways more than once
* Tanteel: repeatedly creating a power slide and steering it back with opposite lock at high speed , starting with 4 or more power slides and usually concluded with Ta&#x27;geed, Sefty, or Axeyat. It is also considered the main maneuver.
* Tatweef: passing another vehicle, truck, or more going sideways at very high speed up to on a public highway no matter how busy the traffic is

The cars are generally stock mid-size or entry-level luxury sedans, such as the Toyota Camry, Kia Optima, Chevrolet Cruze, Kia Cadenza, Honda Accord, etc., minimizing personal cost and repair liability. While there have been instances involving high-end vehicles such as Ferraris and Nissan GT-Rs, these are relatively less common compared to joyriders stealing sedans or compact cars for the purpose of drifting, abandoning them after an event.

SUVs and pickup trucks, most notably the Toyota Land Cruiser family (both the modern and classic variants), are sometimes used for this purpose.

Sociologists and criminologists in the region cite what is locally known as &quot;tufush&quot;, roughly translating to idleness or desperation, indicating &quot;the lack of recreational activities that might interest them&quot;, hence why many young Saudis turn to the extreme underground sport despite both safety risks and law enforcement reprisals.

==Response==
Often the police receive reports about high-speed drifting from concerned citizens demanding an arrest because of the risk to public safety. The drifters are rarely caught as the events are organised using an illegal spotter or spotters who use mobile phones to disband the vehicle activity before the police arrive on the scene. Although the police response is rapid, investigations often prove fruitless; generally, the spectators and drivers have left or are dispersing into regular traffic when the police arrive. Videos of tafheet events are often uploaded to the Internet to be seen by the spectators and drivers. Occasionally, police attempt to intercept the drivers but are chased away by both the drivers and spectators.

At the peak of reckless driving, Saudi Arabia had one of the highest car-caused death tolls in the world.

In March 2014, a 23-year-old Saudi nicknamed &quot;King Al Nazeem&quot; was sentenced to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes for a series of car drifting and firearms offenses in Riyadh and Al-Qassim Province. The drifter was also banned from driving for life. He was later killed in a car accident that was a result of the drifting.

To combat this, academies and leagues have since been established by professional racers in the region, in an effort to mitigate illegal street drifting incidents and to educate youths against the dangers of such activities, encouraging them instead to participate in officially sanctioned events.

With the Saudi government eager to end this life-endangering activity, the police needed to come up with a prompt solution. Speed limit cameras and GPS tracking systems began to roll out nationwide to ease apprehending the street drifters and enforcing stricter sanctions on reckless driving, among several measures taken by Saudi Arabia.

<doc id="1294916" wikidata="Q1268501" url="?curid=1294916" title="Dwight Stephenson">
<text>Dwight Eugene Stephenson (born November 20, 1957) is an American former professional football player who was a center for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL) from 1980 to 1987. He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Stephenson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Early life and college==
Stephenson was born in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. He played college football at the University of Alabama under coach Bear Bryant. Bryant called Stephenson the best center he ever coached, and described him as &quot;a man among children&quot;. He was the Crimson Tide&#x27;s starting center from 1977 to 1979, and was a member of Alabama&#x27;s back-to-back national championship teams of 1978 and 1979. He was a two-time second-team All-American; in 1978 by United Press International (UPI) and 1979 by the Associated Press (AP) and UPI. &quot;His speed, his foot quickness, was off the chart,&quot; said Mike Brock, a former Alabama lineman. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t compare it to other people who played at that time. There was no way for defenses to deal with him.&quot;

==Professional career==

Stephenson was drafted by Don Shula and the Miami Dolphins in the second round of the 1980 NFL draft. He was used on special teams only until late in the 1981 season, when starting center Mark Dennard was injured. A few seasons later, Stephenson was &quot;universally recognized as the premier center in the NFL&quot;.

With the exceptionally explosive Stephenson as offensive captain, the Dolphins offensive line gave up the fewest sacks in the NFL for a record six straight seasons, from 1982 to 1987, which doubled the length of the previous record. He retired from pro football in 1987, after sustaining a left knee injury in a play involving New York Jets Marty Lyons and Joe Klecko.

Stephenson was voted as an All-Pro five consecutive times from 1983 to 1987. He was selected to play on five Pro Bowl squads over the same span. He was named AFC Offensive Lineman of the Year by the NFLPA five consecutive times (1983–87) and voted the Seagram&#x27;s Seven Crowns of Sports Offensive Lineman of the Year three consecutive times (1983–85). He started at center in the AFC Championship Game three times, in 1982, 1984, and 1985. He was the starting center in the Dolphins&#x27; two most recent Super Bowl appearances: Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX. In 1985, Stephenson was the recipient of the NFL Man of the Year Award for &quot;outstanding community service and playing excellence.&quot;

==Honors and later life==

On December 12, 1994, Stephenson was added to the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll.

Despite the brevity of his career, in 1999, Stephenson was ranked number 84 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Also in 1999, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame, and in 2011, Stephenson was inducted into the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, for his contributions to sports in southeastern Virginia.

In 1998, Stephenson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was quoted as saying that &quot;I know I’m not going to make every block, but I don’t like to ever get beat. That’s what keeps me motivated. There’s always the next play to get ready for.”

In 2005, Stephenson was named the Walter Camp Man of the Year.

He is the namesake of Pro Football Focus&#x27; annual Dwight Stephenson Award, honoring the player the website considers best in the NFL regardless of position.

After retiring from football, as of 2013, Stephenson had worked as a construction manager and general contractor in Florida. He remains a strong supporter of the University of Alabama&#x27;s football team.

<text>The Tongariro Alpine Crossing in Tongariro National Park is a tramping track in New Zealand, and is among the most popular day hikes in the country. The Tongariro National Park is a World Heritage site which has the distinction of dual status, as it has been acknowledged for both its natural and cultural significance.

The crossing passes over the volcanic terrain of the multi-cratered active volcano Mount Tongariro, passing the eastern base of Mount Ngauruhoe.

The full distance of the track is usually .

==Walk details==
The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is usually walked from Mangatepopo in the Ruapehu region to Ketetahi Hot Springs, due to the Mangatepopo end being higher in altitude () than the Ketetahi Hot Springs end (), therefore requiring less climbing. The crossing takes about seven hours of steady walking to complete in good weather, taking longer in winter or if walked from the Ketetahi end.
As of October 2023, the Department of Conservation instituted a booking system for the hike in order to gather better information about its usage.

The crossing is a linear journey, starting on the west side of Mount Tongariro and finishing on the north side. Originally, this meant that returning to the western end required retracing the 19.4 km crossing, walking 26 km via State Highways 46 and 47 back to the other trailhead, or completing the Tongariro Northern Circuit. Nowadays there are many local companies that offer shuttle services between the track end points

The track begins at the western end near the Mangatepopo Hut with a low gradient until the foot of the steep Tongariro saddle. After the climb to the saddle, the path takes descents and ascents into and back out of two different craters, passing the Emerald Lakes and along the edge of the Blue Lake. The last two hours of the walk involve a long descent down the northern flank of the volcano, passing the Ketetahi Hot Springs.
New Zealand Mountain Safety Council&#x27;s video on the Tongariro Alpine Crossing

Climbing of Mount Ngauruhoe as a side trip from the main crossing is not allowed anymore (as requested by the local &quot;iwi&quot;) and track markings were removed.

There are no guaranteed fresh water supplies on the walk. Springs in the area are often scalding hot and tainted with minerals and dissolved metals from the volcanic activity. Most natural water in the area is not drinkable. Access is not permitted to Ketetahi Hot Springs, about 10 minutes from the Ketetahi hut. The springs are located on of private land owned by the local iwi Ngāti Tuwharetoa that has never been part of Tongariro National Park. The area of the springs is dangerous and a person was badly burned in 2007 when they entered the closed area. 


==Alpine exposure and 2007 name change==
Until 2007 the crossing was called the &quot;Tongariro Crossing&quot;, but this was changed to the &quot;Tongariro Alpine Crossing&quot; to emphasize the extreme weather on the exposed terrain. Almost the entire length of the crossing is in volcanic terrain with no vegetation and fully exposed to weather – at moderate altitude. As the crossing is easily accessible, it is walked by large numbers of tourists and casual walkers each year. The Department of Conservation is concerned about trampers being unprepared for the conditions they may encounter and introduced the name change to warn the many poorly equipped visitors of potential hazards. Key hazards are the high wind chill factor, the rapid change in weather and very poor visibility in the sudden storms with blinding snow and cloud. In 2006, two people of an estimated 65,000 walkers died on the track. Although the route is marked with poles, it is quite common in poor weather for visibility to be severely reduced. Poles may be snow covered or destroyed by wind gusts in winter.

==Volcanic features==

Most of the walk is through raw volcanic terrain. The three volcanoes in the area are all highly active and the terrain reflects this. Solidified lava flows, loose tephra, and solidified volcanic lava bombs abound. Large amounts of minerals are brought to the surface and are highly visible in the colours of rocks and ridges. Active fumaroles abound on several sections of the walk, constantly emitting steam and sulphur dioxide gas into the air and depositing yellow sulphur specks around their edges. The lakes and pools on the walk are deeply coloured by the volcanic minerals dissolved in them. Some areas feature large springs emitting near-boiling water and torrents of steam. The terrain underfoot for most of the walk is either sharp edged new volcanic rock or loose and shifting tephra, mainly ash and lapilli. In some crater areas it is finer ash that has become moist and compacted.
In August 2012 a small eruption of 10,000 cubic metres of ash from the Te Maari (sometimes spelled Te Māri or Te Mari) craters on Mt Tongariro sent a shower of ash and blocks up to 1m in diameter over the track. The blocks damaged the roof of the Ketetahi hut which is 1.5 km west of the explosive craters. No one was hurt. The alpine crossing was temporarily closed as about 75% of the track is within 3 km of Te Maari. The track is usually to windward of Te Maari as the prevailing wind is west to south west in this region. When mixed with rain the ash forms a gritty mud.
In late November 2012 Te Maari crater again erupted an ash cloud 4,000m high over a 5-minute period. About 100 people were in the vicinity including a group of 20 13-year-old students from Gulf Harbour school but no one was injured. The crater is visible from the Ketetahi area. There are no tracks to Te Maari as it is an unstable, volcanically active zone. The Tongariro Alpine track was closed for 4 days but the other 12 tracks on the mountains were left open. Fumaroles remain active around the active rim of Te Maari crater and there is a strong smell of sulphur gas close to the rim.

<doc id="1294919" wikidata="Q334362" url="?curid=1294919" title="Fred Mulley">
<text>Frederick William Mulley, Baron Mulley, PC (3 July 1918 – 15 March 1995) was a British Labour Party politician, barrister-at-law and economist.

==Early life==
Mulley was born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the son of William Mulley, a general labourer from The Fens, and his wife Mary (née Boiles), a domestic servant. He attended Warwick School on a scholarship between 1929 and 1936, leaving with the higher school certificate. As his father, who by this time was unemployed, could not afford to support him through university, Mulley instead became an accounts clerk under the national health insurance scheme. He served in the Worcestershire Regiment during the Second World War, reaching the rank of sergeant, but was captured in 1940 and spent five years as a prisoner of war in Germany. During this time he obtained a BSc in economics from the University of London as an external student and became a chartered secretary.

At the end of the war, Mulley received an adult scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, graduating with a first-class degree in politics, philosophy and economics in 1947. After a brief spell as an economics fellow at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1948–50), he trained as a barrister, being called to the Bar in 1954.

==Parliamentary career==
Mulley had been a member of the Labour Party and the National Association of Clerks and Administrative Workers since 1936, and at the 1945 general election he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Sutton Coldfield. He became Member of Parliament for Sheffield Park in 1950, a position he held until deselected by his local party prior to the 1983 general election, when his constituency disappeared in a redistribution of boundaries.

During a long career in politics Mulley held many ministerial positions, including Minister of Aviation (1965–67), Minister for Disarmament (1967–69), and Minister of Transport (1969–70, 1974–75). While at the Transport Ministry he believed it would be inappropriate to be seen to be a car driver; thus, although he owned an Austin Maxi, his wife was the sole user of it during this period.

In 1975 Harold Wilson brought him into the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science, and in 1976 became Secretary of State for Defence.

He fell asleep during the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Review of the Royal Air Force at RAF Finningley in 1977 when there was considerable noise around him. Having a small sleep during exercise was referred to by members of the RAF as having a &quot;Fred Mulley&quot;. It was suggested in &quot;Private Eye&quot; that Mulley was guilty of treason (then still a capital offence) for having slept with the Queen.

Writing in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, former Cabinet minister Edmund Dell argued that Mulley was both a party loyalist of &quot;unassailable&quot; working-class credentials and a genuine Oxbridge intellectual, an unusual combination that made him valuable to Wilson and to Wilson&#x27;s successor, James Callaghan.

==House of Lords==
After retiring from the House of Commons in 1983, he was created a life peer as Baron Mulley, of Manor Park in the City of Sheffield on 30 January 1984, and he held a variety of directorial positions.

==Legacy==
A main road in the Lower Don Valley in Sheffield is named after him.

<doc id="1294927" wikidata="Q3529459" url="?curid=1294927" title="Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley">
<text>Ivo Francis Walter Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley (13 March 1859 – 10 April 1927), styled The Honourable Ivo Bligh until 1900, lord of the manor of Cobham, Kent, was a British nobleman, parliamentarian and cricketer.

Bligh captained the England team in the first ever Test cricket series against Australia with The Ashes at stake in 1882/83. Later in life, he inherited the earldom of Darnley and sat at Westminster as an elected Irish representative peer.

==Background and education==
Bligh was born in London, the second son of John Bligh, 6th Earl of Darnley, by Lady Harriet Mary, daughter of Henry Pelham, 3rd Earl of Chichester. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1882. At Cambridge, he was secretary of the University Pitt Club. and played for Cambridge against Oxford in the Real Tennis Varsity Match of 1880.

==Cricket career==
Although the history of Test cricket between England and Australia dates from 1877, it was after an English team led by Monkey Hornby lost to the Australians at The Oval in 1882, that &quot;The Sporting Times&quot; newspaper wrote a mock obituary to English cricket, noting that the body would be cremated and the ashes sent to Australia. The following winter&#x27;s tour to Australia was billed as an attempt to reclaim The Ashes. Bligh&#x27;s team was successful, winning the three-match Ashes series two-one, although a fourth game, not played for The Ashes, and hence a matter of great dispute, was lost.

A small terracotta urn was presented to The Hon. Ivo Bligh, as England captain, by a group of Melbourne women after England&#x27;s victory in the Test series. The urn is reputed to contain the ashes of a bail, symbolising &quot;the ashes of English cricket&quot;. While the urn has come to symbolise The Ashes series, the term &quot;The Ashes&quot; predates the existence of the urn. The urn is not used as the trophy for the Ashes series, and, whichever side &quot;holds&quot; the Ashes, the urn remains in the MCC Museum at Lord&#x27;s. Since the 1998/99 Ashes series, a Waterford crystal trophy has been presented to the winners.

Bligh is commemorated by a poem inscribed on the side of the urn:

:&quot;When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn;&quot;
:&quot;Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return;&quot;
:&quot;The welkin will ring loud,&quot;
:&quot;The great crowd will feel proud,&quot;
:&quot;Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn;&quot;
:&quot;And the rest coming home with the urn.&quot;

Bligh also played for Cambridge University and Kent in a first-class cricket career which lasted from 1877 to 1883. He was elected President of the Marylebone Cricket Club for 1900/01 and of Kent County Cricket Club in 1892 and 1902.

==Public offices==
Bligh succeeded his elder brother Edward as Earl of Darnley in 1900. As the holder of an Irish peerage he was not automatically entitled to a seat in the House of Lords (his brother&#x27;s English peerage, the barony of Clifton, had passed to Edward&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth), but was elected as soon as was practicable, in March 1905, to sit in Parliament as an Irish representative peer.

The year after his succession to the family titles, Lord Darnley was appointed a deputy lieutenant and justice of the peace for Kent. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 4th Volunteer Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) on 16 July 1902.

==Personal life==
He married Florence Rose Morphy, daughter of John Stephen Morphy, of Beechworth, Victoria, Australia on 9 February 1884. She had been a music teacher at Rupertswood, where her future husband had stayed during his tour of Australia. They had two sons and a daughter:
*Esmé Bligh, 9th Earl of Darnley (1886–1955)
*Hon. Noel Gervase Bligh (14 November 1888 – 1984), married Mary Jack Frost and had issue
*Lady Dorothy Violet Bligh (8 February 1893 – 16 January 1976)

In 1884, he became a Christian through Dwight L. Moody&#x27;s preaching, after C. T. Studd invited him to attend Moody&#x27;s campaign meeting.

He served as the President of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1900.

Lord Darnley died at Shorne, Kent in April 1927, aged 68, being succeeded in the family titles by his eldest son, Esmé. His wife, &#x27;Florence, Dowager Countess of Darnley&#x27;, presented the urn to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) after her husband&#x27;s death. She died in August 1944, having been honoured as one of the first Dames of the British Empire in 1919.

Ivo Bligh is buried in the family vault at the collegiate church of St Mary Magdalene, Cobham, Kent.

<text>Krzysztof Kosiński, also known as Kryshtof Kosynsky (, &quot;Kryshtof Kosynsky&quot;; ; 1545–1593), was a Cossack noble from the Podlachia region. He was a colonel of the Registered Cossacks and self-proclaimed hetman. He led two consecutive rebellions against the local Ruthenian nobility, known as the Kosiński uprising.

==Life==
The Kosiński uprising (1591–1593) is a name applied to two rebellions in the eastern parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (modern-day Ukraine) organised by Krzysztof Kosiński against the local Ruthenian nobility and magnates.

His forces were first defeated by Duke Janusz Ostrogski in the Battle of Piątek on 2 February 1593. Kosiński promised to subject his forces to the Polish Monarchy; however, he soon escaped to Zaporizhzhia, where he began organizing a new army. In 1593 he set out for Cherkasy but was soon killed.

<text>The Battle of Ticinus was fought between the Carthaginian forces of Hannibal and a Roman army under Publius Cornelius Scipio in late November 218 BC as part of the Second Punic War. It took place in the flat country on the right bank of the river Ticinus, to the west of modern Pavia in northern Italy. Hannibal led 6,000 Libyan and Iberian cavalry, while Scipio led 3,600 Roman, Italian and Gallic cavalry and a large but unknown number of light infantry javelinmen.

War had been declared early in 218 BC over perceived infringements of Roman prerogatives in Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal) by Hannibal. Hannibal had gathered a large army, marched out of Iberia, through Gaul (modern France) and over the Alps into Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), where many of the local tribes were opposed to Rome. The Romans were taken by surprise, but one of the consuls for the year, Scipio, led an army along the north bank of the Po with the intention of giving battle to Hannibal. The two commanding generals each led out strong forces to reconnoitre their opponents. Scipio mixed many javelinmen with his main cavalry force, anticipating a large-scale skirmish. Hannibal put his close-order cavalry in the centre of his line, with his light Numidian cavalry on the wings.

On sighting the Roman infantry the Carthaginian centre immediately charged and the javelinmen fled back through the ranks of their cavalry. A large cavalry melee ensued: many cavalry dismounted to fight on foot and some of the Roman javelinmen reinforced the fighting line. This continued indecisively until the Numidians swept round both ends of the line of battle. They then attacked the still disorganised javelinmen; the small Roman cavalry reserve, to which Scipio had attached himself; and the rear of the already engaged Roman cavalry. All three of these Roman forces were thrown into confusion and panic.

The Romans broke and fled, with heavy casualties. Scipio was wounded and only saved from death or capture by his 16-year-old son. That night Scipio broke camp and retreated over the Ticinus; the Carthaginians captured 600 of his rearguard the next day. After further manoeuvres Scipio established himself in a fortified camp to await reinforcements while Hannibal recruited among the local Gauls. When the Roman reinforcements arrived in December under Tiberius Longus, Hannibal heavily defeated him at the battle of the Trebia. The following spring, strongly reinforced by Gallic tribesmen, the Carthaginians moved south into Roman Italy. Hannibal campaigned in southern Italy for the next 12 years.

== Background ==
===Iberia===

The First Punic War was fought between Carthage and Rome, the two main powers of the western Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC. They struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. The war lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC, until the Carthaginians were defeated. The Treaty of Lutatius was signed by which Carthage evacuated Sicily and paid an indemnity of 3,200 talents over ten years. Four years later, when Carthage was weakened by the mutiny of part of its army and the rebellion of many of its African possessions, Rome seized Sardinia and Corsica on a cynical pretence and imposed a further 1,200 talent indemnity. The annexation of Sardinia and Corsica by Rome and the additional financial imposition fuelled resentment in Carthage. The contemporary Greek historian Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again nineteen years later.

Shortly after Rome&#x27;s breach of the treaty the leading Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca led many of his veterans on an expedition to expand Carthaginian holdings in south-east Iberia (today Iberia consists of Spain and Portugal); this was to become a quasi-monarchial, autonomous Barcid fiefdom. Carthage gained silver mines, agricultural wealth, manpower, military facilities such as shipyards, and territorial depth which encouraged it to stand up to future Roman demands. Hamilcar ruled as a viceroy and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Hasdrubal, in 229BC and then his son, Hannibal, eight years later. In 226 BC the Ebro Treaty was agreed with Rome, specifying the river Ebro as the northern boundary of the Carthaginian sphere of influence. A little later Rome made a separate treaty with the city of Saguntum, which was situated well south of the Ebro. In 218 BC a Carthaginian army under Hannibal besieged, captured and sacked Saguntum and early the following year Rome declared war on Carthage.

===Cisalpine Gaul===
Since the end of the First Punic War Rome had also been expanding, especially in the area of north Italy either side of the river Po known as Cisalpine Gaul. Roman attempts to establish towns and farms in the region from 232 BC led to repeated wars with the local Gallic tribes, who were finally defeated in 222BC. In 218BC the Romans pushed even further north, establishing two new towns, or &quot;colonies&quot;, on the Po and appropriating large areas of the best land. Most of the Gauls simmered with resentment at this intrusion. The major Gallic tribes in Cisalpine Gaul attacked the Roman colonies there, causing the Romans to flee to their previously established colony of Mutina (modern Modena), where they were besieged. A Roman relief army broke through the siege, but was then ambushed and itself besieged in Tannetum.

It was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead an army. In 218 BC the Romans raised an army to campaign in Iberia under the consul Publius Scipio, who was accompanied by his brother Gnaeus. The Roman Senate detached one Roman and one allied legion from the force intended for Iberia to reinforce the Roman position in northern Italy. The Scipios had to raise fresh troops to replace these and thus could not set out for Iberia until September. At the same time another Roman army in Sicily under the consul Sempronius Longus was preparing for an invasion of Carthaginian Africa.

===Carthage invades Italy===

Meanwhile, Hannibal assembled a Carthaginian army in New Carthage (modern Cartagena) over the winter, marching north in May 218 BC. He entered Gaul to the east of the Pyrenees, then took an inland route to avoid the Roman allies along the coast. Hannibal left his brother Hasdrubal Barca in charge of Carthaginian interests in Iberia. The Roman fleet carrying the Scipio brothers&#x27; army landed at Rome&#x27;s ally Massalia (modern Marseille) at the mouth of the Rhone in September, at about the same time as Hannibal was fighting his way across the river against a force of local Gauls at the battle of Rhone Crossing. A Roman cavalry patrol scattered a force of Carthaginian cavalry, but Hannibal&#x27;s main army evaded the Romans and Gnaeus Scipio continued to Iberia with the Roman force; Publius returned to northern Italy to coordinate the immediate Roman response there. The Carthaginians crossed the Alps with 38,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry in October 218 BC, surmounting the difficulties of climate, terrain and the guerrilla tactics of the native tribes.

Hannibal arrived with 20,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and 37 elephants in what is now Piedmont, northern Italy. The Romans had already withdrawn to their winter quarters and were astonished by Hannibal&#x27;s appearance. His surprise entry into the Italian peninsula led to the cancellation of Rome&#x27;s planned invasion of Africa by an army under Longus. The Carthaginians needed to obtain supplies of food, as they had exhausted their reserves. They also wished to obtain allies among the north-Italian Gallic tribes from which they could recruit, as Hannibal believed that he required a larger army if he were to effectively take on the Romans. The local tribe, the Taurini, were unwelcoming, so Hannibal promptly besieged their capital, (near the site of modern Turin) stormed it, massacred the population and seized the supplies there. The modern historian Richard Miles believes that with these brutal actions Hannibal was sending out a clear message to the other Gallic tribes as to the likely consequences of non-cooperation.
Hearing that Publius Scipio was operating in the region, he assumed the Roman army in Massala which he had believed en route to Iberia had returned to Italy and reinforced the army already based in the north. Believing he would therefore be facing a much larger Roman force than he had anticipated, Hannibal felt an even more pressing need to recruit strongly among the Cisalpine Gauls. He determined that a display of confidence was called for and advanced boldly down the valley of the Po. However, Scipio led his army equally boldly against the Carthaginians, causing the Gauls to remain neutral. Both commanders attempted to inspire the ardour of their men for the coming battle by making fiery speeches to their assembled armies. Hannibal is reported to have stressed to his troops that they had to win, whatever the cost, as there was no place they could retreat to.

After camping at Piacenza, a Roman colony founded earlier that year, the Romans created a pontoon bridge across the lower river Ticinus (the modern Ticino) and continued west. When his scouts reported the nearby presence of Carthaginians, Scipio ordered his army to encamp. The Carthaginians did the same. Next day each commander led out a strong force to personally reconnoitre the size and make up of the opposing army, about which they would have been almost completely ignorant.

==Opposing forces==
Anticipating an engagement as he closed with the Romans, Hannibal had recalled all of his scouts and raiding parties and took with him an exclusively cavalry force which included almost all of his 6,000-strong mounted contingent. Carthage usually recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many were from North Africa, and are usually referred to as Libyans; the region provided two main types of cavalry: close-order shock cavalry (also known as &quot;heavy cavalry&quot;) carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers from Numidia who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat. Iberia also provided experienced cavalry: unarmoured close-order troops referred to by the ancient historian Livy as &quot;steady&quot;, meaning that they were accustomed to sustained hand-to-hand combat rather than hit and run tactics. Hannibal&#x27;s cavalry contingent would have consisted almost entirely of these three types, but the numbers of each are not known.

Most male Roman citizens were liable for military service and would serve as infantry, with a better-off minority providing a cavalry component. Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two or more legions, each of 4,200 infantry and 300 cavalry. Approximately 1,200 of the infantry in each legion, poorer or younger men unable to afford the armour and equipment of a standard legionary, served as javelin-armed skirmishers, known as velites. They carried several javelins, which would be thrown from a distance, a short sword, and a shield. An army was usually formed by combining one or several Roman legions with the same number of similarly sized and equipped legions provided by their Latin allies; allied legions usually had a larger attached complement of cavalry than Roman ones. Scipio&#x27;s army consisted of four legions, with approximately 16,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry. A further 2,000 Gallic cavalry and many Gallic infantry were also serving with the Romans. Scipio led out all of his 3,600 cavalry and, anticipating that they would be outnumbered, supplemented them with a large but unknown number of the 4,500 or so available velites.

==Battle==
Neither the precise date nor the precise location of the battle are known: it took place in late November 218 BC on the flat country on the west bank of the Ticinus, not far from modern Pavia. The ancient historians Livy and Polybius both give accounts of the battle, which agree on the main events, but differ in some of the details. Formal battles were usually preceded by the two armies camping two to twelve kilometres (1–7 mi) apart for days or weeks; sometimes forming up in battle order each day. In such circumstances either commander could prevent a battle from occurring, and unless both commanders were willing to at least some degree to give battle the stand off would end with one army simply marching off without engaging. Many battles were decided when one side was partially or wholly enveloped and their infantry were attacked in the flank or rear. It was unusual, prior to Ticinus, for one side&#x27;s more mobile cavalry to be similarly enveloped. During periods when armies were encamped in close proximity it was common for their light forces to skirmish with each other, attempting to gather information on each other&#x27;s forces and achieve minor, morale-raising victories. These were typically fluid affairs and viewed as preliminaries to any subsequent battle.
Hannibal placed his cavalry in a line with the close-order formations in the centre. The more manoeuvrable Numidian cavalry were positioned on the flanks and possibly held back slightly. Scipio, who had gained a low opinion of the Carthaginian cavalry from the clash near the Rhone, expected an extended exchange of javelins and hoped that his velites, being smaller targets and better able to shelter behind their shields than the Carthaginian horses, would come off best. He arranged the 2,000 Gallic cavalry to the front of his formationmany or all of them would have carried a javelinman riding behind each of the cavalrymen, as was their tradition. Scipio positioned the velites in close support of the Gauls. On sighting the enemy, the velites sallied forward from behind their cavalry to advance within javelin-hurling range. On seeing this, the whole of the Carthaginian close-order cavalry promptly charged them. The Roman light infantry, realising they would be cut down if the Carthaginians came into contact with them, turned and fled, making no attempt to throw their missiles. The Roman cavalry, who were all close order attempted to counter charge the Carthaginians. They were obstructed by the large number of their infantry attempting to pass through their ranks to the rear, and in the case of the Gallic cavalry, possibly by still having a javelinman riding into battle behind each of the cavalrymen. The modern historian Philip Sabin comments that the Roman cavalry and infantry got into a &quot;dreadful tangle&quot;.

The cavalry did not move into contact at speed, but at a fast walk or slow trot; any faster would have &quot;ended in a growing pile of injured men and horses&quot;, according to the modern historian Sam Koon. Once in contact with the enemy, many of the cavalrymen dismounted to fight; this was a frequent occurrence in Punic War cavalry combat. There is debate among modern scholars as to the reasons for this common tactic. Certainly the second men on some, and possibly all, of the 2,000 Gallic cavalry&#x27;s horses dismounted and joined the fight. Some of the Roman javelinmen also reinforced their cavalry comrades, but the extent to which this occurred is unclear. The ensuing melee is recorded as continuing for some time, with no clear advantage being gained by either side.

Then the Carthaginian light cavalry swept round both ends of the line of battle, attacking the still disorganised velites and the small Roman cavalry reserve, where Scipio had positioned himself. These Carthaginians also threatened, and threw javelins at, the rear of the already engaged Roman troops, throwing them into confusion and panic. The velites, still aware of their vulnerability to cavalry, immediately fled. The Roman reserve cavalry attempted to protect the rear of the fighting line, but were surrounded and Scipio was badly wounded. The main force of Roman cavalry, attacked from both sides, was routed and suffered heavy losses. In the confusion Scipio&#x27;s 16-year-old son, also named Publicus Cornelius Scipio, cut his way through to his wounded father at the head of a small group; he escorted him away from the fight, saving him from being either captured or killed. The losses suffered by each side are not known, but the Roman casualties are believed to have been severe.

The surviving Roman forces regathered at their camp, still held by their heavy infantry. Aware the Carthaginians could now use their superiority in cavalry to isolate his camp, Scipio withdrew during the night back over the Ticinus. He left a force behind to dismantle the pontoon bridge so the Carthaginians would be unable to follow. Hannibal pursued the next day and captured 600 men from this rearguard, but not before the bridge had been rendered impassable.

==Aftermath==

The Romans withdrew as far as Piacenza. Two days after Ticinus the Carthaginians crossed the river Po, and then marched to Piacenza. They formed up outside the Roman camp and offered battle, which Scipio refused. The Carthaginians set up their own camp some away. That night 2,200 Gallic troops serving with the Roman army attacked the Romans closest to them in their tents, and deserted to the Carthaginians; taking the Romans&#x27; heads with them as a sign of good faith. Hannibal rewarded them and sent them back to their homes to enrol more recruits. Hannibal also made his first formal treaty with a Gallic tribe, and supplies and recruits started to come in. The Romans abandoned their camp and withdrew under cover of night. The next morning the Carthaginian cavalry bungled their pursuit and the Romans were able to set up camp on an area of high ground by the river Trebbia at what is now Rivergaro. Even so, they had to abandon much of their baggage and heavier gear, and many stragglers were killed or captured. Scipio waited for reinforcements while Hannibal camped at a distance on the plain below and gathered and trained the Gauls now flocking to his standard.

Shocked by Hannibal&#x27;s arrival and Scipio&#x27;s setback, the Roman Senate ordered the army commanded by Tiberius Longus in Sicily to march north to assist Scipio. When Longus arrived in December, Hannibal enticed him into attacking and heavily defeated him at the battle of the Trebia; only approximately 10,000 of the Roman army of 40,000 were able to fight their way off the battlefield. As a result the flow of Gallic support became a flood and the Carthaginian army grew to 60,000 men. Hannibal settled into winter quarters to rest and train his men, while the Romans drew up plans to prevent Hannibal from breaking into Roman Italy. In May 217BC the Carthaginians crossed the Apennines and provoked a Roman army into a hasty pursuit without proper reconnaissance. Hannibal set an ambush and in the battle of Lake Trasimene completely defeated the Roman force, killing 15,000 Romans and taking 15,000 prisoner. A cavalry force of 4,000 from another Roman army were also engaged and wiped out. Hannibal campaigned in Italy for the next 12 years.

In 204 BC Publius Cornelius Scipio, the same man who had fought as a youth at Ticinus, invaded the Carthaginian homeland in North Africa, defeated the Carthaginians in two major battles and won the allegiance of the Numidian kingdoms of North Africa. Hannibal and the remnants of his army were recalled from Italy to confront him. They met at the battle of Zama in October 202BC and Hannibal was decisively defeated. As a consequence Carthage agreed a peace treaty which stripped it of most of its territory and power.

<text>Jean-Jacques Henner (5 March 1829 – 23 July 1905) was a French painter, noted for his use of sfumato and chiaroscuro in painting nudes, religious subjects and portraits.

==Biography==

Henner was born at Bernwiller (Alsace). He began his studies in art as a pupil of Michel Martin Drolling and François-Édouard Picot. In 1848, he entered the École des Beaux Arts in Paris, and took the Prix de Rome with a painting of &quot;Adam and Eve finding the Body of Abel&quot; in 1858. In Rome, he was guided by Flandrin, and painted four pictures for the gallery at Colmar among other works.

He first exhibited &quot;Bather Asleep&quot; at the Salon in 1863 and subsequently contributed &quot;Chaste Susanna&quot; (1865), now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. Other noted works include: &quot;Byblis turned into a Spring&quot; (1867); &quot;The Magdalene&quot; (1878); &quot;Portrait of M. Hayem&quot; (1878); &quot;Christ Entombed&quot; (1879); &quot;Saint Jerome&quot; (1881); &quot;Bara&quot; (1882); &quot;Herodias&quot; (1887); &quot;A Study&quot; (1891); &quot;Christ in His Shroud&quot; and a &quot;Portrait of Carolus-Duran&quot; (1896); a &quot;Portrait of Mlle Fouquier&quot; (1897); and &quot;The Dream&quot; (1900).

&quot;The Levite of the Tribe of Ephraim&quot; (1898) was awarded a first-class medal. Among other professional distinctions, Henner also took a Grand Prix for painting at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1873, Officer in 1878, and Commander in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Cabanel in the Institut de France. Henner&#x27;s most widely known work is his 1885 painting of Saint Fabiola. Although the original is now lost, it was copied by artists around the world for devotional purposes. Artist Francis Alÿs has collected over 500 copies of the painting in a variety of media. The collection is known as the &quot;Fabiola Project&quot;.

Henner died at age 76 in Paris.

==Pupils==

Henner had numerous pupils; among them were the American painter Mathilde Mueden Leisenring and the Romanian artist Dimitrie Serafim. From 1874 to 1889 he taught at &quot;the studio of the ladies&quot;, organized with Carolus-Duran, at a time when women were not allowed entry to the École des Beaux-Arts. Some of these students also served as his models. One of these was Dorothy Tennant, who later married Henry Morton Stanley. Another was Laura Leroux-Revault, daughter of his close friend Hector Leroux; Henner&#x27;s full-length portrait of Laura Leroux now at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay was shown at the Paris Salon of 1898 and purchased by the French State.

Another pupil was Elizabeth Snowden Nichols Watrous (1858–1921), later the wife of artist Harry Watrous. Henner gave the couple a painting when they were married in 1887.

Suzanne Valadon (1865–1938) also worked as one of his models.

<text>Luie Hond (; &quot;Lazy Dog&quot;) was a Dutch reggae and ska band from Leeuwarden, founded in the summer of 1997 and active until December 2007.

After being a regional success, the band became nationally known in 1999, when the popular pop singer Ilse DeLange discovered the group and invited them to do the opening act for her tour. Through the years, they released several singles, before finally releasing their debut album &quot;Hier Is...&quot; (&quot;Here is...&quot;) in 2004. In 2006, they released its successor &quot;Met Liefde&quot; (&quot;With Love&quot;).

Throughout their existence, the band achieved moderate popularity in the Netherlands, though never the mainstream success they hoped for. Their albums were generally well received, their tours were successful and they frequently appeared on several Dutch and Belgium music festivals, such as Lowlands and Appelpop. Nevertheless, the band quit in October 2007, mainly citing financial problems. Vocalist/Guitarist Joris Mous said in an interview with 3VOOR12/Friesland:

:&quot;All kinds of things are going on within a band, but the most important reason is: the money. It is financially very difficult to make ends meet. We tried everything to be able to live off of it, but if you have to conclude after 10 years that you can&#x27;t, then you have to stop.&quot;

After playing three farewell concerts in December 2007, Luie Hond discontinued activities for good.

<text>The Hamamni Persian Baths is located in a historical building of Stone Town, Zanzibar. The name Hamamni is also used to refer to the neighbourhood where the building is located.

The Baths were built between 1870 and 1888 for sultan Barghash bin Said for use as public baths, and maintained this function until 1920. They are referred to as &quot;Persian&quot; because their construction was commissioned to Shirazi architects. The word &quot;Hamamni&quot; means &quot;the place of the baths&quot;.

The building had a complex structure with several rooms, including hot and cold baths, toilets, shaving areas, and a restaurant. Hot water was provided by underground aqueducts. Entrance was subject to a fee, so that only wealthy zanzibaris could use them regularly. They were open both to men and women, but with different hours of admittance. 

The Baths are not working anymore, but they are open to visitors and are a major tourist attractions of Stone Town. They were restored in 2006 by volunteers from the CHAM association.

Visits are limited to some areas of the original complex because part of it (e.g., the restaurant) has since been adapted for private residences.

<doc id="1294958" wikidata="Q1691329" url="?curid=1294958" title="William Duer (Continental congressman)">
<text>William Duer (March 18, 1743 – May 7, 1799) was a British-born American jurist, developer, and financial speculator from New York City. A Federalist, Duer wrote in support of ratifying the United States Constitution as &quot;Philo-Publius&quot;. He had earlier served in the Continental Congress and the convention that framed the New York Constitution. In 1778, Duer signed the United States Articles of Confederation and is one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

Duer owned 10 slaves.

Duer spent most of his life as a financial speculator. In 1792, following his involvement in one of the nation&#x27;s first financial panics, Duer went bankrupt and was confined to debtors&#x27; prison, where he died seven years later.

==Early life==
Duer was born in Devonshire, Great Britain, in 1743. He was the son of John Duer, a planter in Antigua in the West Indies, who kept a villa in Devon, and Frances Frye. She was the daughter of Sir Frederick Frye, who held a command in the West Indies, where she met and married Duer.

Duer was educated at Eton College, and while still under age, was put into the army as ensign. He accompanied Robert Clive as aide-de-camp on his return to India as governor general in 1762. He suffered severely from the climate, so Lord Clive sent him back to England, where he remained five years until his father&#x27;s death, upon which he inherited his father&#x27;s estates in Dominica.

==Career==

Having left the army, Duer went to Antigua. He traveled to New York State for the first time in 1768, to arrange for a regular and constant supply of lumber for his plantations in Antigua and Dominica. As a planter, he traded extensively with Philip Schuyler, who persuaded him to move to New York early in the 1770s. On a previous trip to the area, Duer had purchased tracts of land on the upper Hudson River near Albany. The area, known as Fort Miller, served both as Duer&#x27;s first residence and as the site of his early financial ventures. Duer set up sawmills, warehouses, and a store.

In 1773 he returned to England, where he obtained a contract to supply the Royal Navy with timber for masts and spars. By 1776, had built a moderately successful mercantile business based primarily on lumber production.

===American Revolution===
Duer was originally a moderate Whig, somewhat reluctant to become involved in active resistance to the British government. But he became a member of the Provincial Congress in 1775; he was one of the committee which drafted the original New York Constitution the next year.

Duer was a member of the 1st New York State Legislature, serving in the New York State Senate for the Eastern District from September 9, 1777 to June 30, 1778. He served as a member of the Continental Congress in 1778 and 1779. While in Congress, he reportedly impressed future president John Adams and financier Robert Morris from Philadelphia, with whom he served on the finance committees as well as the &quot;Board of War,&quot; the precursor to the War Department.

In 1779, Duer returned to private business, in partnership with John Holker, the French commercial agent. He also did well in his business of supplying the American army, under contracts arranged for him by Robert Morris.

===Later life===
Duer became a prominent speculator after the war; he was also elected to the New York General Assembly in 1786. When Alexander Hamilton, Schuyler&#x27;s son-in-law, became first Secretary of the Treasury in 1789, Duer became the first Assistant Secretary. He continued to speculate in American bonds, including the failed Scioto Company scheme to buy up the American debt to France at a discount.

Duer went bankrupt as a result of the Panic of 1792, and was held in debtors&#x27; prison for the rest of his life. His failure has been cited as a cause of the panic, reportedly the first in New York caused by speculation. The loss was estimated at 3 million dollars and impoverished many in all classes.

==Personal life==

In 1779, Duer married Lady Catherine Alexander (1755–1826), second daughter of Sarah (née Livingston) Alexander and Lord Stirling, a major general in the Continental Army. The marriage took place at Stirling&#x27;s country seat, &quot;The Buildings,&quot; near Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was designed in the style of a residence of an English nobleman, with all the appointments of an English country seat. Catherine&#x27;s paternal grandparents were New Jersey Attorney General James Alexander and merchant Mary Spratt Provoost Alexander, and her maternal grandparents were Catherine Van Brugh Livingston and Philip Livingston, 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor. She was, descended from the De Peysters, Livingstons, and Schuylers, and occupied a prominent place in the society of the period.

Together, they were the parents of eight children, including:
* William Alexander Duer (1780–1858), who was a justice of the New York State Supreme Court, and for many years the President of Columbia University. He married Hannah Maria Denning (1782–1862), daughter of U.S. Representative William Denning.
* John Duer (1782–1858), who was a noted lawyer and jurist of New York. He married Anna Bedford Bunner (1783–1864), sister of U.S. Representative Rudolph Bunner.
* Frances Duer (1786–1869), who was married to Beverley Robinson (1779–1857), grandson of merchant Beverley Robinson.
* Sarah Henrietta Duer (b. 1787), who married John Witherspoon Smith, son and grandson of Princeton Presidents Samuel Stanhope Smith and John Witherspoon.
* Catherine Alexander Duer (1788–1882).
* Maria Theodora Duer (1789–1837), who married Beverly Chew (1773–1851) in 1810.
* Henrietta Elizabeth Duer (1790–1839), who married Morris Robinson (1784–1849), brother of Beverley Robinson and founder of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York.
* Alexander Duer (1793–1819), who married Ann Maria Westcott (1808–1897), daughter of Col. and New York State Senator David M. Westcott, in 1815.

Duer died in New York City on April 18, 1799 at age 57. He was buried in the family vault under the old church of St. Thomas and was later reinterred in Jamaica, Long Island, New York. After his death, his widow remarried to William Neilson on September 15, 1801.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest son William, he was the grandfather of Denning Duer, great-grandfather of James Gore King Duer, and the great-great-grandfather of Alice Duer Miller (1874–1942), the feminist poet and writer. Through his son John, he was the grandfather of William Duer (1805–1879) who served in the U.S. Congress representing New York.

<doc id="1294965" wikidata="Q6866341" url="?curid=1294965" title="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach">
<text>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach is a junior ministerial post in the Department of the Taoiseach of the Government of Ireland who performs duties and functions delegated by the Taoiseach.

The position was first created in 1922 as Parliamentary secretary to the President of the Executive Council. In 1937, following the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland, the position was changed to that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. In 1978, the position was superseded by the office of Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach.

One of the Ministers of State in this department is assigned the role of Government Chief Whip and is the most senior Minister of State in the government of Ireland. They attend cabinet meetings, but do not have a vote and are not one of fifteen members of the government. The role of the Whip is primarily that of the disciplinarian for all government parties, to ensure that all deputies, including ministers, attend for Dáil Business and follow the government line on all issues.

The incumbent Government Chief Whip is Mary Butler, TD, and the deputy Chief Whip is Emer Currie.

==Responsibilities of Government Chief Whip==
The main responsibilities of the Chief Whip include:

===Attendance at Government meetings===
The Chief Whip is a Minister of State who attends Government meetings, but does not have a vote. The title is sometimes given as &quot;Minister of State, attending Government&quot;. Other Ministers of state with the title &quot;Minister of State, attending Government&quot; are commonly known as super junior ministers.

===Preparation of weekly brief for Taoiseach on legislation in preparation===
Before each Dáil Session letters are sent to all Ministers to see what legislation or other business their department expects to place before the Dáil. A weekly report on what stage Bills are at is given to the Taoiseach. During the Order of Business the Taoiseach is often queried about what legislation is promised. The weekly report shows what Bills are promised and gives an expected date of publication of the Bill.

===Scheduling and monitoring of Dáil business===
Once a bill has been published and is placed on the Dáil Order Paper the staff in the Whip&#x27;s office keep in touch with Minister&#x27;s Private Secretaries about when they wish to have their bill taken in the Dáil - sometimes the Whip&#x27;s office have to insist that a bill is taken on a certain day, particularly when there is not much business for the House. Every Wednesday the Private Secretary prepares an agenda (called a schedule - see example) for each sitting day of the following week. This is discussed at a meeting of the Dáil Business Committee, which includes the whips of the major parties, including the government (Fianna Fáil) chief whip; Fine Gael whip; Sinn Féin whip and Labour Party whip.

===Operation of the pairing system===
A pair is an arrangement whereby a Government Deputy&#x27;s name is linked with an Opposition Deputy in the event of a Vote arising. The practice is that under such an arrangement neither Deputy votes in any Division arising while the pairing agreement is valid. Because it is obviously so important for the Government to maintain its majority in the Dáil Chamber the pairing arrangements must be attended to very carefully. If a member cannot attend a notice explaining their absence must be sent to the Chief Whip as early as possible.

===Leinster House accommodation for political parties===
The Minister has to ensure that facilities and services in Leinster House are satisfactory for members and staff. The Opposition Whips liaise with him on matters such as office equipment which they may require.

===Chairing Legislation Committee===
The Chief Whip chairs the weekly meeting of the Legislation Committee. This Committee meets to discuss the progress of Bills in Departments and tries to ensure that there is always enough business for the Dáil and Seanad. The meeting is attended by the Attorney General, a Parliamentary Draftsman, Programme Manager to the Taoiseach, Programme Manager to the Tánaiste, Principal Officer in this Department (who looks after legislation) and the Chief Whip.

<doc id="1294966" wikidata="Q2578513" url="?curid=1294966" title="William Duer (U.S. Congressman)">
<text>William Duer (March 25, 1805 – August 25, 1879) was an American lawyer and politician. In addition to serving in local offices in both California and New York, he represented New York in the United States House of Representatives from 1847 to 1851.

A native of New York City, Duer was a member of a family long prominent in New York politics and government. He graduated from Columbia College in 1824, studied law in New York City, and attained admission to the bar in 1828. After practicing in Oswego for two years, he returned to New York City, where he continued practicing law. After a brief residence in New Orleans, in 1835 he returned to Oswego, where he became active in politics and government as a Whig. He served in the New York State Assembly for two one-year terms (1840 and 1841) and was Oswego County&#x27;s District Attorney from 1845 to 1847. In 1846, Duer was elected to the U.S. House. He was reelected in 1848 and served two terms, 1847 to 1851.

After leaving Congress, Duer served as U.S. Consul in Valparaíso, Chile for two years, then moved to San Francisco, where he practiced law and served as county clerk. In 1859 he returned to Oswego, where he was active in efforts to prevent the onset of the American Civil War. Once the conflict began, Duer supported the Union, but opposed the Republican Party and continued to advocate for concessions on the slavery and secession issues a way to end the war.

In retirement, Duer resided on Staten Island. He died there in 1879 and was buried at Silver Mount Cemetery.

==Early life==
William Duer was born in New York City on March 25, 1805, the son of John Duer (1782–1858) and Anna Bedford Bunner Duer (1783–1864). William Duer was the grandson of Continental Congressman William Duer (1747–1799) and great-grandson of General William Alexander. Rudolph Bunner was his uncle.

He graduated from Columbia College in 1824 and was the valedictorian of his class. He studied law, was admitted to the bar, and began to practice in Oswego.

==Start of career==
In 1830, Duer moved to New York City. Later that year, Duer and Elijah Paine Jr. published a reference work in octavo format, &quot;Practice of the Courts of Common Law in the State of New York&quot;. In 1832, he ran unsuccessfully for the New York State Assembly. He lived in New Orleans from 1833 to 1835, then returned to Oswego, where he continued to practice law. Duer served in the Assembly in 1840 and 1841. In 1842 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress.

Duer was a Delegate to the 1844 Whig National Convention. He served as Oswego County District Attorney from 1845 to 1847.

==Congressman==
In 1846 Duer was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Whig. He was reelected in 1848 and served in the 30th and 31st Congresses, March 4, 1847 to March 3, 1851.

In Congress, Duer pursued a moderate course on slavery and was willing to allow it to continue where it already existed, but not to expand to new territories unless approved by the voters. He supported both the Wilmot Proviso and the Compromise of 1850.

During the protracted struggle to elect a Speaker of the House in 1849, Duer&#x27;s name was one of those brought forth as a compromise choice. During a discussion about the Speakership election, Duer stated that Richard Kidder Meade, a Virginia Democrat, was a dis-unionist who favored secession. Meade denied it, which prompted Duer to accuse him of lying. A near-riot ensued, with Democrats attacking Whig and Free Soil Party legislators, and the Sergeant at Arms unable to immediately restore order. Meade and Duer were separated by other House members, and the issue was resolved without further violence when Meade stated that he had not meant to impugn Duer&#x27;s integrity in his reply to Duer&#x27;s claim that Meade was a secessionist, and Duer withdrew the word &quot;liar&quot; to describe Meade&#x27;s reply.

==Later career==
After leaving Congress Duer was appointed Consul in Valparaíso, Chile, and he served from 1851 to 1853.

In 1854, Duer began to reside in San Francisco, California and founded a law firm in partnership with Balie Peyton, Delos Lake, and Julius K. Rose. He served as San Francisco&#x27;s County Clerk from October 1857 to October 1859.

In 1859, Duer returned to Oswego. During the 1860 presidential election, Duer was opposed to secession and civil war, so he attempted to rally support for a moderate course that made concessions on slavery in order to prevent the slave holding states from leaving the Union. To that end, he supported the Constitutional Union Party ticket of John Bell for president and Edward Everett for vice president. Later that year, Duer sent a widely reprinted letter to several newspapers in which he urged Bell and Everett supporters to switch their allegiance to Democrat Stephen A. Douglas as the best chance of preserving the Union. In addition, he was nominated for Congress by a convention that attempted to create a fusion of Bell, Douglas, and John C. Breckinridge supporters, but attracted little support in the 22nd District. In the general election, Republican William E. Lansing soundly defeated Douglas Democrat D. Franklin Chapman.

During the American Civil War, Duer remained a unionist, but affiliated with the Democratic Party; in 1861, he was elected as a delegate to the state Democratic convention. Duer continued to advocate concessions to the southern states in order to end the war. Among his proposals was one calling for the slave holding states to return to the Union so they could advocate for secession by means of a Constitutional amendment; in his view, if the southern states were determined to leave the Union, they were required to follow a legal process for doing so rather than engaging in armed rebellion.

==Retirement and death==
In retirement, Duer was a resident of Staten Island. He died in New Brighton on August 25, 1879. Duer was buried at Silver Mount Cemetery.

==Family==
In 1835, Duer married Lucy Chew (1816-1900), a distant cousin who was the daughter of Beverley Chew and Marie Theodosia (Duer) Chew of New Orleans. They were the parents of John, Beverley, Marie, Anne, Catharine, and Irving.

<doc id="1294971" wikidata="Q333046" url="?curid=1294971" title="David Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford">
<text>David Arthur Russell Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford, (born 18 January 1936) is a British Conservative Party politician, journalist, and economic consultant. Having been successively Secretary of State for Energy and then for Transport under Margaret Thatcher, Howell has more recently been a Minister of State in the Foreign Office from the election in 2010 until the reshuffle of 2012. He has served as Chair of the House of Lords International Relations Committee since May 2016. Along with William Hague, Sir George Young and Kenneth Clarke, he is one of the few Cabinet ministers from the 1979–97 governments who continued to hold high office in the party, being its deputy leader in the House of Lords until 2010. His daughter, Frances, was married to the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne.

==Early life==
Howell was educated at Eton College, before entering King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1959 with 1st Class honours in Economics. He proceeded to the degree of Master of Arts in 1963. He went to work in HM Treasury joining the Treasury Economic Section from 1959 to 1960. In 1960 he wrote the book &quot;Principles to Practice&quot;, published jointly, and spent four years as a journalist, leader writer and special correspondent on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He succeeded Geoffrey Howe as editor of &quot;Crossbow&quot; (the journal of the Bow Group) from 1962 to 1964 before he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Dudley in the 1964 general election.

==Political career==
Two years later, in 1966, Howell was elected MP for the safe seat of Guildford in Surrey, for the Conservative Party, a seat he held until retiring at the 1997 general election. On 6 June 1997 he was made a life peer as Baron Howell of Guildford, of Penton Mewsey, in the County of Hampshire.

When Margaret Thatcher was elected in 1979, she made Howell her first Secretary of State for Energy and then moved him to Transport in the reshuffle of September 1981 and until 1983. His time at the Ministry of Transport saw the commissioning and publication of the highly controversial Serpell Report into Britain&#x27;s Railways. The report which emerged included proposals which would have greatly reduced the rail network in Britain and met with an extremely hostile reaction. Although these proposals were not pursued, the episode caused considerable political problems for the Government and contributed to Thatcher dropping Howell from the Cabinet.

Howell wrote the book &quot;Freedom and Capital&quot;, published 1981. He then wrote the book &quot;Blind Victory: a study in income, wealth and power&quot;, published 1986. In 1987 he became chairman of the Select committee on Foreign Affairs. He was president of the British Institute of Energy Economics from 2005 to 2014 and has been chairman of the Windsor Energy Group since 2003.

In the House of Lords, he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 2005 to 2010. On the election of the Coalition government he was quickly recommended to Foreign Secretary by the Prime Minister as an enthusiastic advocate of HS2, the only conservative in the government with the relevant ministerial experience. In the September 2012 reshuffle, having served two years as initially agreed, he was asked by the Prime Minister to stand down to provide a Foreign Office place for Baroness Warsi. Howell was Opposition Spokesperson for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2000 to 2010. He is now Chairman of the new House of Lords International relations Committee. Lord Howell is also Chairman of The Commonwealth Societies Association.

From the election of May 2010 until the reshuffle of 2012, Lord Howell served as Minister of State in the Foreign Office in David Cameron&#x27;s government, under William Hague as Foreign Secretary. From September 2012 to April 2013, he was personal adviser to the Foreign Secretary on Energy and Resource Security.

In November 2012, Greenpeace released secret film of an interview with Lord Howell about the advantages of natural gas over wind power, in which he said that David Cameron &quot;is not familiar with these issues, doesn&#x27;t understand them&quot;, but that George Osborne, his son-in-law, &quot;is of course getting this message and is putting pressure on&quot;.

In May 2013, he was appointed president of the Energy Industries Council. In July 2013, he said, in a Lords&#x27; discussion on fracking, &quot;there are large, uninhabited and desolate areas, certainly in parts of the north-east, where there is plenty of room for fracking, well away from anybody&#x27;s residence, and where it could be conducted without any threat to the rural environment&quot;. There was much adverse reaction.

<text>William Alexander Duer (September 8, 1780 – May 30, 1858) was an American lawyer, jurist, and educator from New York City who served as the President of Columbia University from 1829 to 1842. He was also a slaveholder, owning numerous enslaved African Americans.

==Early life==
He was the son of William, a member of the Continental Congress and Catherine Alexander Duer. His brother John Duer was a New York lawyer and jurist. His nephew William Duer, the son of John Duer, also served in Congress. William A. Duer studied law in Philadelphia, and with Nathaniel Pendleton in New York.

==Career==
During the quasi-war with France in 1798 he obtained the appointment of midshipman in the navy, and served under Stephen Decatur. After the conflict with France ended, he resumed his studies with Pendleton, and was admitted to the bar in 1802.

He engaged in business with Edward Livingston, who was then district attorney and mayor of New York. After Livingston moved to New Orleans, Duer formed a professional partnership with his brother-in-law, Beverley Robinson. In addition to practicing law, he contributed to a partisan weekly paper called the &quot;Corrector&quot;, conducted by Peter Irving in support of Aaron Burr. Duer later moved to New Orleans to again form a law partnership with Livingston, and also made a study of Spanish civil law, which had governed New Orleans in its early years. Duer found the climate in New Orleans disagreeable to his health, and this factor coupled with his marriage with the daughter of William Denning, a prominent New York politician and businessman, convinced him to return to New York City.

In New York, he contributed literary articles to the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, the newspaper of his friend Peter Irving. He next opened an office in Rhinebeck, and in 1814 was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he was appointed chairman of a committee on colleges and academies, and succeeded in passing a bill, which is the original of the existing law on the subject of the common-school income. He was also chairman of the committee that arranged the constitutionality of the state law vesting the right of navigation in Livingston and Robert Fulton, and throughout his service bore a prominent part in promoting canal legislation.

From 1822 until 1829, he was a judge of the New York Supreme Court. In 1829, he was elected president of Columbia College (now Columbia University), where he remained until failing health compelled him to resign in 1842. During his administration he delivered to the senior class a course of lectures on the constitutional jurisprudence of the United States (published in 1833; revised ed., 1856). He delivered a eulogy on President James Monroe from the portico of the city hall. After his retirement he resided in Morristown, New Jersey.

===Works===
After retiring, he wrote the life of his grandfather, Lord Stirling (published by the Historical Society of New Jersey). In 1847 he delivered an address in the college chapel before the literary societies of Columbia, and in 1848 an historical address before the St. Nicholas Society, which gives early reminiscences of New York, and describes the scenes connected with the inauguration of President Washington, both of which were published. He was the author of two pamphlets addressed to Cadwallader D. Colden on the &quot;Steamboat Controversy,&quot; and the &quot;Life of William Alexander, Earl of Stirling&quot; (New York, 1847).

==Personal life==
He was married to Hannah Maria Denning (1782–1862), daughter of William Denning, a prominent whig of New York. Together they had:

* Henrietta Amelia Duer (d. 1824)
* Frances Maria Duer (1809–1905), who married Henry Sheaffe Hoyt, nephew of Jesse Hoyt, a Collector of the Port of New York who was known for his role in the Swartwout-Hoyt scandal.
* Catherine Theodora Duer (1811–1877)
* William Alexander Denning Duer (1812–1891), a banker with Prime, Ward &amp; King who married Caroline King (1813–1863), daughter of James G. King
* Eleanor Duer (1814–1892)
* Edward Alexander Duer (1815–1831)
* Sarah Henderson Duer (1817–1856)
* John King Duer (1818–1859), who married Georgeanna Huyler (1818–1884)
* Elizabeth Denning Duer (1821–1900), who married Archibald Gracie King (1821–1897), son of James G. King
* Henrietta Duer (1828–1832), who died young.

Duer died on Staten Island on May 30, 1858; he was buried at First Presbyterian Churchyard, Morristown.

<doc id="1294984" wikidata="Q1433188" url="?curid=1294984" title="Always (Blink-182 song)">
<text>&quot;Always&quot; is a song by American rock band Blink-182, released on November 15, 2004 as the fourth and final single from the group&#x27;s untitled fifth studio album. The song was the lowest charting single from the album, but the song&#x27;s music video received extensive play on music video channels. Like much of the album, the song shows the band&#x27;s 1980s influences, with the multiple-layered, heavily effected guitars and new wave synthesizers.

The song can also be found on the band&#x27;s 2005 compilation &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

==Background==
All three of the band members associated the song with the music of the 1980s. Tom DeLonge, in an interview with MTV News, described the song as a &quot;love song.&quot;

In another interview with MTV News, DeLonge explained the song and addressed the lyrics of the choruses, jokingly:
==Composition==
&quot;Always&quot; was written by bassist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist Tom DeLonge, while sung by DeLonge and Hoppus and produced by Jerry Finn. The song is composed in the key of B major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 158 beats per minute. The vocal range spans from A3 to D7. Referred to as &quot;the &#x27;80s song&quot; during production, &quot;Always&quot; features an uptempo backbeat combined with a New Romantic-era keyboard, and pulls from new wave influences. Mike Rampton of &quot;Louder Sound&quot; described the song as &quot;power-pop perfection&quot;. Andrew Sacher of &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot; felt that &quot;Always&quot; was the most &quot;Cure-sounding song&quot; on the album, rather than &quot;All of This&quot; which featured Robert Smith. Sacher noted the track as a &quot;a truly sweet post-punk love song&quot;. The song&#x27;s outro features four separate bass guitars being played; Hoppus uses a Fender Bass VI, a Fender Precision Bass &quot;doing two different things,&quot; and a Roland Synth Bass. Barker pulled from Missing Persons for inspiration whilst creating the song&#x27;s percussion.

Journalist Joe Shooman pointed out that the song&#x27;s central guitar riff is remescient of The Only Ones&#x27; &quot;Another Girl, Another Planet&quot; (1979). He called it &quot;the thickest-textured Blink track of all-time,&quot; and acknowledged its tribute to 1980s synth-driven pop.

==Chart success and live history==
&quot;Always&quot; was announced as the fourth and final single from &quot;Blink-182&quot; in August 2004. &quot;It&#x27;s gonna change people&#x27;s lives and might actually change the world forever,&quot; guitarist Tom DeLonge jokingly predicted. It was first serviced to radio in mid-November 2004.

The song was only performed twice in its original release, prior to the band&#x27;s &quot;indefinite hiatus.&quot; It has nonetheless been performed regularly since the band&#x27;s return.

==Reception==
A.D. Amorosi of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, in his 2003 review of &quot;Blink-182&quot;, called the song &quot;contagious.&quot; &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, in a 2015 top 10 of the band&#x27;s best songs, ranked it as number four, calling it &quot;far and away the best track on the album.&quot; &quot;Stereogum&quot; and &quot;Kerrang&quot; both named &quot;Always&quot; as Blink-182&#x27;s eighth-best song.

==Music video==

The music video for &quot;Always&quot; was directed by Joseph Kahn. The group shot it while on tour in Australia in mid-2004, at the same studio space used by the Wiggles. It features Australian pop singer Sophie Monk. The video is displayed as three horizontal panels, in which Monk flirts with DeLonge, Hoppus and Barker. However, the panels sever the onscreen participants in three. Monk appears as a fractured whole, while parts of the band members combine to make one character. The trio&#x27;s characters attempt to plead with Monk, trying to repair a damaged relationship, which are depicted through fights, arguments, and &quot;the occasional making-up/making-out,&quot; which is handled by Barker. In reference to the video, DeLonge said &quot;It&#x27;s like doing an algebraic formulation on paper when you watch it. It&#x27;s the same kind of feeling [...] but it&#x27;s rad.&quot; Bassist Mark Hoppus called it the most technically complicated video the band ever had to shoot, as it required choreographed positioning in real time. The video was photographed by Brad Rushing and edited by David Blackburn who won the MVPA Best Editing Award for his work.

The song was a hit on music video channels, where it was among the most-played on Fuse, MTV2 and MuchMusic into January 2005.

<doc id="1295055" wikidata="Q7704295" url="?curid=1295055" title="Terry Dicks">
<text>Terence Patrick &quot;Phil&quot; Dicks (17 March 1937 – 17 June 2020) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was MP for the constituency of Hayes and Harlington from 1983 to his retirement in 1997, having unsuccessfully contested Bristol South in 1979. He obtained the nickname Phil for, according to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;elevating Philistinism to an art form&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Dicks was born with cerebral palsy on 17 March 1937 in Bristol to Frank and Winifred Dicks. He &quot;saw little of his father&quot;, who &quot;did not play a part in his childhood&quot;; his mother, a cleaner, died of arthritis. Leaving school at 15, he worked at Imperial Tobacco as a clerk until 1959, then at the Ministry of Labour. He was educated at the University of Oxford (DipEcon) and the London School of Economics (BSc (Econ)).

==Political career==
===Outside Parliament===
Dicks was elected to Hillingdon Borough Council in 1974. In 1978, as housing committee chairman, he attracted controversy after he offered hostel accommodation to a white Rhodesian family but sent an Asian family &quot;in a taxi to the Foreign Office&quot; despite the fact that both had arrived in the UK as immigrants. Dicks maintained the Asian family&#x27;s grounds for staying were &quot;unconvincing while the Rhodesians’ case was not.&quot; He was suspended in 1982 when the Greater London Council took issue with comments he made regarding arrears from the Strongbridge Housing Association.

Dicks was selected as the Conservative Party&#x27;s candidate for the seat of Bristol South in the 1979 general election, but he lost out to Labour&#x27;s Michael Cocks.

From 1999 until he retired in June 2009, Dicks was a member of Surrey County Council, representing the town of Addlestone. Beginning in 2011, he was a Runnymede district councillor for Chertsey South and Row Town.

===Member of Parliament===
Dicks was elected as the Member of Parliament for Hayes and Harlington in 1983 in succession to Neville Sandelson. He was known for his hardline right-wing views and caused controversy over several public statements he made. His strong opposition to state funding for the arts inspired Labour MP Tony Banks to claim, in a February 1990 debate, that Dicks&#x27; presence in the House of Commons was &quot;living proof that a pig&#x27;s bladder on a stick can get elected to Parliament.&quot;

In another arts funding debate in July that year, his remarks were controversial enough for fellow Conservative MP Patrick Cormack, in a heated House of Commons, to say, &quot;This man is a disgrace to the House of Commons.&quot; Dicks replied, &quot;My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South (Cormack) reminds me of Henry VIII not with all the doublet and hose, but at least well fed.&quot;

Regarding Derrick Gregory, a man with learning disabilities who had been sentenced to death in Malaysia for drug smuggling, Dicks said he would be writing to the Malaysian government congratulating it on its approach. On Farzad Bazoft, an &quot;Observer&quot; journalist hanged by Saddam Hussein in 1990, Dicks said he &quot;deserved to be hanged&quot; on the eve of his execution.

In 1990, when Nelson Mandela declined to meet the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on a trip to London, a greatly offended Dicks asked, rhetorically, &quot;How much longer will the Prime Minister allow herself to be kicked in the face by this black terrorist?&quot;

As an MP and a member of the Conservative Family Campaign, Dicks left a legacy as a critic of high-profile HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns at the time of the emergence of the disease in the 1980s. Frequent controversial jokes furthering these opinions and others – such as suggesting &quot;tell &#x27;em that if you shove your willy [British slang term for a penis] up someone&#x27;s bum you&#x27;re going to catch more than a cold&quot; as a central message of the government&#x27;s HIV/AIDS campaign (instead of encouraging gay men to use condoms), descriptions of immigrants to Britain as &quot;the flotsam and jetsam from all over the world,&quot; and ridiculing a Somali refugee family buying water in a London supermarket, saying &quot;where they come from they&#x27;re happy to drink out of puddles&quot; – fuelled protests, according to the &quot;Socialist Worker&quot;. His Labour successor, left-winger John McDonnell, described him as a &quot;stain,&quot; a &quot;malignant creature,&quot; and an espouser of racism in his maiden speech in 1997.

Dicks called for the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; to be cancelled or screened after 11pm, following a storyline involving a gay kiss between two men. He was supportive of measures to decrease periods for abortion.

==Personal life==
Due to his cerebral palsy, Dicks referred to himself in the House of Commons as a &quot;spastic&quot;.

He had four children – three daughters and a son – across two marriages. He died on 17 June 2020, aged 83.

<doc id="1295060" wikidata="Q2865349" url="?curid=1295060" title="Arthur Shrewsbury">
<text>Arthur Shrewsbury (11 April 1856 – 19 May 1903) was an English cricketer and rugby football administrator. He was widely rated as competing with W. G. Grace for the accolade of best batsman of the 1880s; Grace himself, when asked whom he would most like in his side, replied simply, &quot;Give me Arthur&quot;. An opening batsman, Shrewsbury played his cricket for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and played 23 Test matches for England, captaining them in 7 games, with a record of won 5, lost 2. He was the last professional to be England captain until Len Hutton was chosen in 1952. He was a &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketer of the Year in 1890. He also organised the first British Isles rugby tour to Australasia in 1888.

An expert on sticky wickets, Shrewsbury topped the first-class batting averages seven times including in 1902, his final season. The following spring, incorrectly believing he had an incurable disease, he shot himself at his sister&#x27;s home in Gedling, Nottinghamshire.

==Early life==
Shrewsbury, the seventh child of William Shrewsbury and Mary Ann Wragg, was born in New Lenton, Nottinghamshire. He was educated at the People&#x27;s College, Nottingham and trained as a draughtsman. His early club cricket was, like William Scotton, with Meadow Imperial and he subsequently played for Nottingham Commercial Club where he came to the notice of the county officials.

On 12 May 1873, having just turned 17, Shrewsbury made his first appearance at Lord&#x27;s for the Colts of England against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). His batting was modelled on that of Richard Daft. The season also saw Meadow Imperial, Shrewsbury&#x27;s club side, replaced by Meadow Willow CC.

==First-class beginnings==
Shrewsbury missed most of the 1874 season with rheumatic fever, and did not make his first-class debut until May 1875 for Nottinghamshire against Derbyshire. He ended the season with 313 runs at 17.38, with a top score of 41; in a season of wet weather he finished fourth in the county&#x27;s batting averages.

The following year Shrewsbury made his maiden first-class century, scoring 118 against Yorkshire, at Trent Bridge sharing in an opening partnership of 183 with Richard Daft. Shrewsbury finished the season with an innings of 65 not out against Surrey in a low scoring match. In May 1877, he made 119 at The Oval for the Players of the North against Gentlemen of the South. He also scored four fifties and finished the season with 778 runs at 19.94.

In 1878 Australia made their first tour to England. Their first match was against Nottinghamshire: Shrewsbury scored 8 in an innings victory for the home team. He scored 724 runs at 21.29 during the season with a top score of 74 not out. The following season was less successful – his average dropped to 15.78 and he was not selected for either of the Gentlemen v Players fixtures. He toured North America in September 1879 with Richard Daft&#x27;s XI, where the side won all six matches, all of them against odds (opposition teams of more than eleven players). During the 1880 season he scored 403 runs, his highest score, 66 not out, against the touring Australians.

In 1881 Shrewsbury led the strike of Nottinghamshire professional players alongside Alfred Shaw following disagreements with the county secretary, Captain Henry Holden, over an early season fixture with Yorkshire arranged by Shaw and Shrewsbury. The strike meant Shrewsbury played just three first-class matches during the season. The break allowed him, Shaw and James Lillywhite to organise a lucrative eight-month tour of Australia, New Zealand and America the following winter.

==World tour==
The tour began with games in North America, although Shrewsbury missed the first leg of the tour with bronchitis and sailed directly to Australia via Suez. The five matches in America were financial failures with receipts just covering expenses. 

In Australia, the team played two first-class matches before the First Test. In the second of these the tourists beat Victoria despite having followed-on with Shrewsbury scoring 80 not out in the second innings. The First Test was staged at Melbourne over the New Year. Shrewsbury, one of ten debutants, scored 11 and 16 in a drawn match. Seven matches in New Zealand followed before the team returned to Australia for the remaining three Test matches, Shrewsbury scored 7 and 22 in the Second Test at Sydney. His best performance of the tour came in the Third Test, again at Sydney, top scoring in both innings – 82 and 47 – the next highest score by an Englishman was 23. In the final Test he scored 1, final day rain ruining the best chance of English victory during the series which ended 2–0. The matches in Sydney and Melbourne proved popular meaning the three promoters made £700 each.

After the tour Shrewsbury returned to England in better physical shape thanks to the warmer climate of Australia. He and Shaw wrote to the Nottinghamshire committee to apologise for their previous season&#x27;s actions, and both were welcomed back into the side.

==Domestic success==
In 1882 Shrewsbury scored his maiden first-class double century, the first double century by a Nottinghamshire cricketer, an innings of 207 at The Oval sharing in a stand of 289 with Billy Barnes, a first-class second wicket record. But this was Shrewsbury&#x27;s only score above fifty all season. The following season was in complete contrast, as Shrewsbury scored seven fifties and no century, reaching 1,000 runs in a season for the first time.

In 1884 Australia toured England. Shrewsbury warmed up for the First Test with 209 against Sussex at Hove, sharing in a stand of 266 with Billy Gunn, a first-class record for the fifth wicket. In the drawn First Test at Old Trafford Shrewsbury top scored with 43. He managed 27 in the Second Test which England won by an innings. The Third Test was drawn, Australia having scored 551. Declarations were not permitted until after 1889, and Australia batted for 311 overs. Every England player got a bowl, Shrewsbury coming on last after wicket-keeper Alfred Lyttelton. Shrewsbury finished the season just short of 1,000 runs as Nottinghamshire were declared Champion County, having won nine out of their ten matches.

==Test success==

Lillywhite, Shaw and Shrewsbury arranged another tour of Australia in 1884–85, with Shrewsbury as team captain. In the First Test at Adelaide Shrewsbury opened for the first time in Tests, scoring a duck and 26 not out as England won by 8 wickets. England won by 10 wickets in the Second Test, with Shrewsbury scoring 72 and 0 not out. The next two Tests were lost with Shrewsbury making scores of 18, 24, 40 and 16. In the deciding Fifth Test at Melbourne he played a captain&#x27;s innings scoring 105 not out after dropping down the order, his maiden Test century. Australian critic Felix described the innings:
His play throughout was a treat to look at, and that neat and effective stroke of his between square-leg and mid-on is worth copying. He made a large number of his 105 in this spot. His defence was splendid, his cutting clean and telling, his timing could not well be excelled.
Shrewsbury finished the Test series with 301 runs at 50.16 and made £150 from the tour, the figure reduced by the boycotting of several matches by the 1884 Australians.

In 1885 Shrewsbury topped the batting averages for the first time scoring 1130 runs at 56.50 with four centuries, including carrying his bat for 224 not out at Lord&#x27;s. For the third season in a row Nottinghamshire were Champion County. The following season he once again carried his bat, this time against Gloucestershire defying W. G. Grace for 72 overs in scoring 227 not out. Although Shrewsbury&#x27;s best innings of the season was to come against the touring Australians and the demon, Fred Spofforth.

Shrewsbury warmed up for the Second Test (England won the First Test by 4 wickets) with another hundred against Grace in a Gentlemen v Players fixture. In the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s Shrewsbury demonstrated his ability on sticky wickets against top bowling: against a side containing Spofforth, the finest bowler of the era, he finished the rain-interrupted first day unbeaten on 91, and carried this to 164 in easier conditions on the second day. The second highest score in the match was 58 by Billy Barnes, and Australia lost by an innings. England completed a whitewash with another innings victory at The Oval. Shrewsbury finished the season with 1404 runs as once again Nottinghamshire retained the title.

==Two Australian tours==
England toured Australia in 1886–87 with Shrewsbury once again captaining the team. In two low scoring Tests (no team innings totalled as many as 200) Shrewsbury contributed 46 runs as the tourists won the series 2–0. His best innings of the tour came for the Non-Smokers against the Smokers in Melbourne, where he scored 236 in a total of 803, then a first-class record, as was the third wicket partnership of 311 between Shrewsbury and Billy Gunn. The one-sided matches and the bad weather led to poor crowds, and the tour&#x27;s organisers failed to make a profit. Nevertheless, Shrewsbury was already planning another tour the following year.

1887 proved to be Shrewsbury&#x27;s best season, with 1653 runs at 78.71. His batting average was the highest so far achieved, narrowly beating W. G. Grace&#x27;s record of 78.25 in 1871. Shrewsbury made consecutive scores of 119, 152, 81, 130 and 111, and finished the season with his highest first-class score of 267 against Middlesex. During the season Shrewsbury scored his 10,000th first-class run.

In 1887–88 Shrewsbury made his final tour to Australia. It became a financial disaster, as the Melbourne Club were financing their own rival touring team. Shrewsbury&#x27;s side&#x27;s first match at Melbourne became farcical: against a Victoria side containing only four first-team players the tourists won by an innings and 456 runs. Shrewsbury scored 232, becoming the first Englishman to score a double century in Australia. The two touring teams combined for a Test Match against Australia at Sydney. Shrewsbury top scored with 44 in a low-scoring match which England won. In the final fixture of their tour Shrewsbury scored another double century to finish with 721 runs at 65.54, 500 more than anyone else. To try to recoup some of his losses Shrewsbury stayed in Australia after the cricket tour, and managed an English rugby football team. For this reason he missed the 1888 English cricket season. The football tour in fact added to the losses, ending in an £800 deficit to add to the £2400 lost on the cricket leg of the tour.

==1888 Australian rules football and Rugby tour of Australasia==
Shrewsbury organised and played on a little known and unique tour in which a British team played a series of matches in Australian rules football, in Victoria and South Australia and Rugby matches in Australia&#x27;s northern states and New Zealand. This tour is noteworthy as it was the only tour in the history of Australian rules football, apart from New Zealand&#x27;s early participation in the sport&#x27;s interstate competition, where an international team toured Australia. It was also of note because on the tour a number of people involved on the British side commented that they liked the Australian game more than Rugby. Shrewsbury also participated in organising a return tour by an Australian team to Britain, in which the Australian rules side of the tour was cancelled at the last moment. At the time in England and Scotland there was interest in Australian rules football and games were played, and it has been suggested that had the Australian rule side of tour gone ahead then Australian rules football could possibly have spread around the world like a number of other sports from the British Empire.

==Best batsman in England==
Shrewsbury scored a century against Sussex in his first match back in England, but this was his highest score of the 1889 season. He finished with 522 runs at 37.28. Shrewsbury was chosen as a &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketer of the Year in 1890, an award that had only been introduced the previous year.

In 1890 he matched his highest score with an innings of 267 against Sussex, and he shared in a partnership of 398 with Billy Gunn which remains the second wicket record for Nottinghamshire, and was a first-class record for any wicket for nine years. Australia toured during the season, but Shrewsbury struggled in the Tests with scores of 4, 13, 4 and 9 as England defended The Ashes in a low scoring series. The highest team innings was 176. Shrewsbury topped the domestic batting averages.

Shrewsbury started the 1891 season with a run of low scores, failing to reach double figures in eight consecutive innings in the County Championship (although he did carry his bat for 81 in a Players v Gentleman fixture during this run). However the second half of the season saw a dramatic improvement which resulted in him topping the batting averages once again. He was offered a place on the tour party to Australia, but decided to stay at home to look after the business as his business partner Alfred Shaw was travelling as manager of the team.

In 1892 Shrewsbury scored his tenth and final double century during a match against Middlesex. He scored four more centuries, including carrying his bat for 151 for the Players against the Gentlemen, and had the highest batting average for the third successive season. Australia&#x27;s tour of England in 1893 included three Test matches. In the First Test at Lord&#x27;s Shrewsbury played a similar innings to seven years previously, the great bowler this time was Charles Turner. On a difficult first day wicket Shrewsbury scored 106. Wisden reported:
Shrewsbury&#x27;s batting was marked by extreme patience, unfailing judgment, and a mastery over the difficulties of the ground, of which probably no other batsman would have been capable. During the innings Shrewsbury became the first cricketer to score 1,000 Test runs. He added 81 in the second innings, but rain meant the result was a draw. He had scores of 66, 12 and 19 not out in the rest of the series as England retained the Ashes. Shrewsbury was the leading run scorer in the series with 284 at 71.00.

==After Test career==
Shrewsbury missed the 1894 season because of indifferent health but he reappeared in 1895 leading the county averages in a disappointing season for Nottinghamshire. He passed 1,000 runs in 1896 with 2 centuries including carrying his bat for 125 against Gloucestershire.

Shrewsbury passed 20,000 career first-class runs in 1897. His only century of the season came for the Players against the Gentlemen, scoring 125 as captain. Shrewsbury&#x27;s scores improved in 1898 and 1899 with season tallies of 1,219 and 1,257 runs, leading the county averages in both seasons. In 1899 Shrewsbury and Arthur Jones shared in an opening partnership of 391, which remained a county record until 2000.

In 1900 Shrewsbury&#x27;s season average dropped to 32.03, his lowest since 1884, but he still topped the county averages. In 1901 Nottinghamshire were dismissed for 13 against Yorkshire, the second lowest total ever made in county cricket, Shrewsbury split his hand while fielding and missed the rout.

In 1902, aged 46, Shrewsbury again topped the first-class batting averages. He notched up four centuries, including two in a match for the first time. His performances during the season earned him further praise in the 1903 Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack:
His batting was marked by all its old qualities, and except that he is, perhaps, less at home on a really sticky wicket than he used to be, there is little or no
change to be noticed in his play. He was as patient and watchful as ever, and once or twice when runs had to be made in a hurry he surprised everybody by the freedom and vigour of his hitting.
The Nottinghamshire Committee raised donations of £177 14s (worth about £ at current prices) for Shrewsbury in recognition of his batting performance.

==Death==
Shrewsbury complained of kidney pains during a match for Lenton United on 27 September, and during the winter he consulted various doctors and specialists who could discover nothing seriously wrong with him. During the spring his health started to improve, but it was unlikely that he would play county cricket in 1903.

On 12 April 1903 Shrewsbury bought a revolver from a local gunsmith. He returned a week later after having difficulty in loading the gun. The clerk found that Shrewsbury had the wrong bullets and supplied the correct ones. Shrewsbury went to his bedroom that evening and shot himself first in the chest and then, when that did not prove fatal, in the head. His girlfriend, Gertrude Scott, found him bleeding from a head wound and by the time a doctor arrived Shrewsbury was dead. At the inquest, held the following day, the coroner decided that Shrewsbury had committed suicide, his mind having been unhinged by the belief that he had an incurable disease. The coroner added that there was, however, no evidence to show Shrewsbury was suffering from a major illness.

Shrewsbury&#x27;s funeral took place two days after his death at All Hallows Church, Gedling.

==Statistical overview==
Shrewsbury was the first cricketer to pass 1,000 Test runs when he reached 7 during his innings of 106 at Lord&#x27;s in 1893. His career total of 1,277 runs was a record until January 1902 when it was overtaken by Joe Darling. Shrewsbury had held the record for over 15 years; only Clem Hill and Wally Hammond have held the record for longer.

Two of Shrewsbury&#x27;s three Test centuries came at Lord&#x27;s including his highest Test innings of 164, a score which remained a Test record at the ground until 1924 when it was beaten by Jack Hobbs. In six innings at the ground Shrewsbury scored 395 runs at an average of 65.83.

Shrewsbury set a number of batting records for Nottinghamshire. He scored the county&#x27;s first double-century in 1882 and scored seven of the county&#x27;s first eight double-centuries. He was also the first Nottinghamshire cricketer to score a hundred in both innings of a match. His 1887 county record of six centuries in a season wasn&#x27;t beaten until 1925.

In the seven seasons between 1886 and 1892 Shrewsbury topped the first-class averages five times – and during one of these seasons, 1888, he did not play at all as he was in Australia managing the rugby football team.

==Style==

Shrewsbury was considered quite a slow scoring batsman, but C. B. Fry described his play thus: &quot;The idea that he is slow is mistaken. True, he is often half an hour without scoring; but somehow he makes up for it and is all but even with his more mobile partner. The fact is he waits for the ball he wants, and then secures a certain fourer. He does not waste time and energy in banging ball after ball into fieldsman&#x27;s hands.&quot;

Edward Sewell, a contemporary of Shrewsbury&#x27;s, described his play like this: &quot;And so, little by little, this little man playing a quite different kind of cricket to any other Big Noises of his time, perfected his own chosen method; never heeding anything in the shape of advice or an adviser, until he became a king of legend.&quot;
The method of play Sewell was referring to is back-play, which allowed Shrewsbury to master the bad wickets which were often found on county grounds. Most batsmen of 1870s and 1880s typically played off the front foot. His Wisden obituary contains similar sentiments: &quot;As a batsman he had a style of back play peculiarly his own, and his judgment of the length of bowling was almost unequalled. It was said of him that he seemed to see the ball closed up to the bat than any other player.&quot;

Shrewsbury was not a strong or muscular man and stated that he did not hit the ball, but steered it in the desired direction.

Shrewsbury&#x27;s technique was criticised by Rait Kerr in his book &#x27;The laws of cricket&#x27;. He wrote: &quot;As we have seen the improvement in pitches enabled Arthur Shrewsbury to develop a new gospel of defensive batsmanship which soon made many converts. From about 1885 this technique involved an increasing use of the pads.&quot; At the time the lbw law stated that for the batsman to be out, the ball had to pitch between wicket and wicket. In 1888 the MCC considered a change to the law but instead issued a statement saying that defending the wicket with the body was against the spirit of the game.

==Shaw and Shrewsbury==
During the 1879 tour of North America Shrewsbury along with Alfred Shaw finalised plans to start a business. &#x27;The Midland Cricket, Lawn Tennis, Football and General Athletic Sports Depot&#x27; in Carrington Street, Nottingham. Following the profitable tour of 1881/2 they opened a factory under the name &#x27;Gresham Works&#x27; situated in Waterway Street and in the spring of 1884 the name of the firm was changed from &#x27;The Midland Cricket, Lawn Tennis, Football and General Athletic Sports Depot&#x27; to &#x27;Shaw and Shrewsbury&#x27;. Their trademark of a kangaroo and emu with a cricket bat between them was introduced in 1886.

Following the financial losses made during the tour of Australia in 1887/8 the firm downsized from the two buildings into a single building in Queen&#x27;s Bridge Road.

After Shrewsbury&#x27;s death his share in the firm was split between his brother, William, and four of his nephews. The firm was closed in 1939 with its assets being bought by Grays of Cambridge.

<text>Kosiński uprising (1591–1593) the first Cossack rebellion in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, commanded by the Cossack Hetman Krzysztof Kosiński.

== Prelude ==
In the late 16th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was experiencing a short period of internal stability. This, however, was threatened by the Cossacks, who organised raids into Crimea, Moldavia, and other lands of the Ottoman Empire. To counter the threat, Sultan Murad III threatened Poland–Lithuania with war if the Cossack pillaging continued.

In 1580 the Sejm in Warsaw passed the &quot;Order in Ukraine&quot; (&quot;Porządek ze strony Niżowców i Ukrainy&quot;) Act, in which Registered Cossacks were banned from raids to the Zaporizhian Sich, taking captives or pillaging. Any Cossack who broke this law was to be put to death without trial.
==The uprising==
The immediate cause of the uprising was a dispute between the Cossack hetman Krzysztof Kosiński and the starosta of Bila Tserkva and Voivode of Volyn, Janusz Ostrogski. Kosinski, a nobleman from Podlasie, received lands in the Rokitno area, abandoned after the Crimean Tartar invasions, from Hetman Jan Zamoyski in 1590. However, these lands were taken over by Aleksander Wiśniowiecki and later ceded to Janusz Ostrogski. Feeling wronged, Kosinski attacked Bila Tserkva in December 1591, which sparked an uprising. On 29 December 1591, Kosinski attacked the house of Dmitry Kurtsevich Buliga in Bila Tserkva, stealing valuables and land grant documents. He then attacked Bohuslav, Tripoli and Pereyaslav, spreading the conflict to Kievshchyna, Braclawshchyna and Volhynia. King Sigismund III Vasa appointed a commission to put down the rebellion, headed by Mikołaj Jazłowiecki. In 1592, after unsuccessful negotiations, Kosinski continued fighting, destroying Ostrogski&#x27;s estates. The final battle took place on 2 February 1593 at Piatek, where Kosinski&#x27;s army was defeated by Janusz Ostrogski. After the surrender, The self-proclaimed hetman did not keep the terms of capitulation and fled to Zaporizhia , where he gathered a 2,000-strong detachment of Cossacks. He established contacts with Russia and Tatars , seeking support against the Commonwealth everywhere .But in May 1593 he was finally defeated at Cherkasy by Alexander Wisniowiecki and died in unclear circumstances. The 1593 Sejm declared the participants in the uprising to be traitors, but a settlement was later reached that allowed the registered Cossacks to keep their weapons and Chaika, declaring a general amnesty.

==Parliamentary career==
After unsuccessfully contesting the seat of Shoreditch and Finsbury in both 1950 and 1951, he became MP for Norwich South in 1955.

As Minister for Public Building and Works in 1962, Rippon controversially sought to demolish and redevelop the Italianate Foreign and Commonwealth Office main building designed in the 1860s by Sir George Gilbert Scott. After a campaign led by The Victorian Society and a public outcry the decision was overturned and the building was subsequently granted Grade I listed building status.

In 1964 Rippon was defeated, but moved to the constituency of Hexham in Northumberland at the 1966 general election and remained MP there until retiring in 1987. Among his posts in the Shadow Cabinet was that of Shadow Defence Secretary from 1969 to 1970.

In 1970 he became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster under Edward Heath, and being in favour of the Common Market was given the responsibility of negotiating Britain&#x27;s entry into it. In 1972 he moved to become Secretary of State for the Environment. During his tenure the Department of the Environment was housed on Marsham Street in unattractive tower blocks nicknamed &#x27;the three ugly sisters&#x27;. Rippon is supposed to have commented to his civil servants that the view from the top floor was the best in London, as one could not see the towers themselves.

While Secretary of State for the Environment he introduced the Water Act 1973, which amalgamated over 1500 separate private, and local authority water provision, sewage, water treatment, and regulatory entities into 10 Regional Water Authorities, organised on a natural Hydrological basis.

He was at one time a prominent member of the Conservative Monday Club, for whom he authored a booklet entitled &quot;Right Angle&quot;, and was guest-of-honour at their Annual Dinner in 1970. The Club was, however, divided on the EEC (European Community) issue, and at their conference in October 1971 members moved and carried a resolution opposing Britain&#x27;s entry.

From 1979 to 1982, Rippon was President of the European Documentation and Information Centre (CEDI).

He was created a life peer on 5 October 1987 taking the title Baron Rippon of Hexham, of Hesleyside in the County of Northumberland.

<text>Boxgrove is a village, ecclesiastical parish and civil parish in the Chichester District of the English county of West Sussex, about north east of the city of Chichester. The village is just south of the A285 road which follows the line of the Roman road Stane Street.

The Anglican parish has an area of . According to the 2001 census it had a population of 901 people living in 423 households of whom 397 were economically active. The 2011 Census indicated at population of 957. Included in the parish are the hamlets of Crockerhill, Strettington and Halnaker.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches northwest to West Dean with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 2,235.

==History==
===Archaeology===

Boxgrove is best known for the Lower Palaeolithic archaeological site discovered in a gravel quarry known as Amey&#x27;s Eartham Pit located near the village but in Eartham Parish. Parts of the site complex were excavated between 1983 and 1996 by a team led by Mark Roberts of University College London.

Numerous Acheulean flint tools and remains of animals (some butchered) dating to around 500,000 years ago were found at the site. The area therefore was used by some of the earliest occupants of the British Isles. Remains of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; were found on the site in 1994, the only postcranial hominid bone to have been found in Northern Europe. Teeth from another individual were found two years later.

===Hundred of Boxgrove===
The ancient hundred of Boxgrove was listed in the Domesday Book (1086) as comprising nine settlements with 246 households. The settlements were Aldingbourne, Halnaker, Strettington, Runcton, East Hampnett, Merston, Westhampnett and Upwaltham, and Boxgrove village itself had 13 households.

===Boxgrove Priory===

A Benedictine monastery was founded at Boxgrove by Robert de Haia (or de la Haye) early in the 12th century. The priory church remains as the Church of England parish church of St Mary and St Blaise, minus the original nave, and mostly dates from the 13th century.

===Early cricket===
Several parishioners of Boxgrove were prosecuted for playing cricket in the churchyard in 1622. There were three reasons for the prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken; the third was the charge that &quot;a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt&quot;.

===19th century===
The population of the parish in 1861 was 666, and the area , of which 1,700 were arable, and the remainder downland.

<doc id="1295160" wikidata="Q808215" url="?curid=1295160" title="Bass oboe">
<text>The bass oboe or baritone oboe is a double reed instrument in the woodwind family. It is essentially twice the size of a regular (soprano) oboe so it sounds an octave lower; it has a deep, full tone somewhat akin to that of its higher-pitched cousin, the English horn. The bass oboe is notated in the treble clef, sounding one octave lower than written. Its lowest sounding note is B2 (in scientific pitch notation), one octave and a semitone below middle C, although an extension with an additional key may be inserted between the lower joint and bell of the instrument in order to produce a low B2. The instrument&#x27;s bocal or crook first curves away from and then toward the player (unlike the bocal/crook of the English horn and oboe d&#x27;amore), looking rather like a flattened metal question mark; another crook design resembles the shape of a bass clarinet neckpiece. The bass oboe uses its own double reed, similar to but larger than that of the English horn.

==Etymology==
The instrument is known popularly as the &quot;bass oboe&quot; in the English language and &quot;hautbois baryton&quot; (baritone oboe) in French. The bass designation is in resonance with that of the bass flute in the flute family and the bass clarinet in that family: an instrument pitched an octave below the principal instrument of its genre.

==History==

Early bass oboes were modeled after bassoons, with a boot joint and bocal (such as the Triebert&#x27;s instruments, which still had a bulb bell) and some holes drilled obliquely; later an enlarged English horn design was adopted. The concept of the bass oboe as an enlarged English horn survived, and the &quot;hautbois baryton,&quot; redesigned by François Lorée, was introduced in 1889.

Some confusion exists between the bass oboe and the Heckelphone, a double reed instrument of similar register introduced by the firm of Wilhelm Heckel in 1904, and which is distinguished from standard members of the oboe family by its wider bore, different fingering system (on older instruments), and larger bell. As a result, it is not always clear in English orchestral works of the early 20th century which of the two instruments is intended when the composer requests &quot;bass oboe&quot;.

The instrument has been manufactured sporadically by various companies, including F. Lorée, Marigaux, Rigoutat, Fossati, and others. It is usually a &quot;special order&quot; instrument, and its purchase price normally exceeds that of a top-of-the-line English horn.

==Repertoire==
*&quot;In the Great Museum of our Memory&quot;, for Bass Oboe by Brian Cherney
*&quot;The East Coast&quot; Concerto for Bass Oboe and Orchestra by Gavin Bryars
*&quot;Earth Spirit&quot; for bass oboe and orchestra by Yuang Chen

One of the most notable uses of the bass oboe is in Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, where the instrument is used to great effect and provides a tone of which no other instrument is capable. Notable solo lines include some faint parts during &quot;Mars&quot;, during the bitonal runs in the woodwind in &quot;Mercury&quot;, numerous exposed lines in the quieter moments of &quot;Saturn&quot; (probably the best example of a solo in the whole work), and in the fifth and sixth bars of the bassoon&#x27;s soli after the opening notes of &quot;Uranus&quot;. The bass oboe is also prominently featured in the First Interlude of Sir Michael Tippett&#x27;s Triple Concerto. There is also a very substantial solo in the second movement of Thomas Ades&#x27; &quot;Asyla&quot;. Frederick Delius scored for the bass oboe in six of his works: Songs of Sunset, A Mass of Life, Requiem, An Arabesque, Fennimore and Gerda and Dance Rhapsody No. 1, however, the latest research reveals that despite his use of this term, Delius&#x27; intended instrument was the Heckelphone. Arnold Bax calls for it in his Symphony No. 1, and Havergal Brian requires an instrument in both the Gothic Symphony and his Symphony No. 4 &quot;Das Siegeslied&quot;. Humphrey Searle calls for the instrument in his Third Symphony (1960). Percy Grainger includes the bass oboe in Children&#x27;s March and The Warriors, which has a notable large solo for the instrument in the middle of the piece. The Bass Oboe solo in &quot;The Warriors&quot; and &quot;Saturn&quot; of &quot;The Planets&quot; are the more famous Bass Oboe excerpts.

The bass oboe has not as yet come into its own as a solo instrument; only two solo bass oboe concertos have been written to date (&quot;The East Coast&quot;, by English composer Gavin Bryars, composed in 1994 and a 2016 Concerto by Canadian composer Christopher Tyler Nickel). The former work was written for the Canadian performer Lawrence Cherney, who uses a bass oboe manufactured by F. Lorée. Two concerti have been written featuring the bass oboe in addition to the other four members of the oboe family, these works being David Stock&#x27;s &quot;Oborama&quot; (Bass Oboe featured in movement IV, Dark and Solemn) and James Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rituals and Dances&quot;, both written for Alex Klein.

British oboist Michael Sluman has commissioned approximately 60 works for the Bass Oboe, a number of which have been performed at recitals in the UK, the 2016 Australian Double Reed Society in Sydney, and the 2018 International Double Reed Society Conference in Granada. These works consist of solo, orchestral, chamber and recital pieces, along with a number of quartets for Oboe, Oboe d&#x27;amore, Cor Anglais, and Bass Oboe, written for the Asyla Oboe Quartet. Michael has given lectures on the Bass Oboe at the Royal Academy of Music, London, King&#x27;s College, London, The University of North Texas and the Royal Northern College of Music.

Robert Moran&#x27;s &quot;Survivor from Darmstadt&quot;, for nine amplified bass oboes, was commissioned by oboist Nora Post and premiered in 1984. At least one sonata for bass oboe and piano, by Simon Zaleski, has been written.

<text>The West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) was an Ugandan rebel group under the command of Juma Oris. 

== History ==
Formed by ex-Uganda Army soldiers who remained loyal to Idi Amin, the group&#x27;s exact foundation is unclear. Its first reported activity was in 1988. It became active as a proper insurgent force from 1994. However, one ex-fighter of the group stated that the WNBF was founded in 1995. It appears to have been a West Nile offshoot of the Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army and recruited primarily in Koboko County, Arua and Obongi, Moyo. One prominent associate of the WNBF was Isaac Lumago.

It was active through the end of the First Congo War in 1997, fighting from Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo against the Uganda People&#x27;s Defense Force. The WNBF worked at destabilizing northern Uganda. It was responsible for many kidnappings and violent raids, and had goals and tactics similar to the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army. While it had initially recruited with promises of generous pay, which proved to be false, it eventually turned to forced recruitment to replenish its ranks. The brutal tactics of the WNBF, including the laying of landmines, made it lose popular support in the region. They were in competition for popular support with the rebel Uganda National Rescue Front II that was operating in the same region simultaneously. 

The fortunes of the WNBF did not really change until UPDF Major General Katumba Wamala arrived in 1996 and initiated a policy of civil-military cooperation. He has stated:
:&quot;Seeing that the people didn’t support the war, my approach was to reach out to them and deny the enemy fertile ground to work on. So I had to combine a military approach with a political strategy... Rather than just sitting in the barracks, I decided to go out and spend time with the communities to work on calling the rebels back. It was very important that we never mistreated reporters (people who reported on rebel activity), so we built up trust.&quot;1

By working through local and traditional authority structures and enforcing a measured approach to the counter-insurgency, Wamala earned the trust of much of the populace and was able to arrange for numerous rebels to return to their former lives. This soft initiative was coupled by military pressure upon WNBF bases in Southern Sudan by the Uganda-backed Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Amid Operation Thunderbolt (1997), the last WNBF bases in Sudan were destroyed in a major battle at Kaya in which the SPLA, UPDF and several Congolese armed groups took part. Its leader Juma Oris was wounded, and the group splintered. By late 1997, the WNBF was no longer capable of significant activity.

<text>Coca-Cola Enterprises was a marketer, producer, and distributor of Coca-Cola products. It was formerly the anchor bottler for Western Europe and most of North America.

Coca-Cola Enterprises&#x27; products included Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Sprite, Fanta, Capri-Sun, Dr Pepper, Chaudfontaine, Schweppes, Monster and Relentless.

== History ==

The Coca-Cola Company decided to consolidate the many independent bottling groups in the Coca-Cola System. Previously, independent businesses in remote geographic areas bottled Coca-Cola products and distributed the merchandise to stores.

In 1980, Coca-Cola acquired the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York for $215 million. In 1982, Coca-Cola acquired the Associated Coca-Cola Bottling Company for $417.5 million. In 1986, Coca-Cola acquired the bottling operations of Beatrice Foods and the bottling operations of the Lupton family. Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. was spun off from The Coca-Cola Company in 1986.

After buying these bottlers, Coca-Cola spun this function off to anchor bottlers in various parts of the world. Coca-Cola Enterprises continued to acquire regional bottlers throughout the 1990s.

The company had its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia and was a separate corporation from The Coca-Cola Company; both companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are components of the S&amp;P 500.

Similar anchor bottlers include the South Pacific area&#x27;s Coca-Cola Amatil, Eastern Europe&#x27;s Coca-Cola Hellenic, and Latin America&#x27;s Coca-Cola FEMSA.

== Territories ==
Coca-Cola Enterprises was the exclusive Coca-Cola bottler for all of Belgium, continental France, Great Britain, Luxembourg, Monaco, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.

Some of its production facilities were located in Norway (Lørenskog), Sweden (Jordbro), The Netherlands (Dongen), Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent and Chaudfontaine (mineral water only)), France (Socx, Grigny, Clamart, Les Pennes-Mirabeau and Castanet-Tolosan), and the UK (Wakefield, Sidcup, Edmonton, Milton Keynes, East Kilbride and Morpeth).

== Electric trucks ==
When Coca-Cola Enterprises was the anchor bottler in North America, it had the largest fleet of hybrid electric trucks in North America. The hybrid electric tractor units were the standard bulk delivery truck the company uses for large deliveries. CCE planned to deploy 185 of these hybrid electric trucks across the United States and Canada in 2009, bringing its total number of hybrid electric delivery trucks to 327, the largest such fleet in North America. The company already had 142 smaller hybrid electric delivery vehicles on the road. The trucks were powered by Eaton Corporation&#x27;s hybrid electric drivetrain systems.

== Sale of assets to The Coca-Cola Company ==
On February 24, 2010, The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises entered talks about selling CCE&#x27;s North American division to Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola paid over $15 billion, including a redemption of Coca-Cola&#x27;s 33% shareholding in CCE. Coca-Cola wanted the business in their asset list because they felt it would save both consumers and Coca-Cola money. Coca-Cola also spun off its small European bottling division to &quot;New CCE&quot;.

The acquisition closed on October 3, 2010.

== Merger ==
On August 6, 2015, Coca-Cola Enterprises announced that it would merge with Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetränke AG, a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Company, into a new company to be called Coca-Cola European Partners PLC.

<doc id="1295181" wikidata="Q2594405" url="?curid=1295181" title="Modern Age of Comic Books">
<text>The Modern Age of Comic Books is a period in the history of American superhero comic books which began in 1985 and continues through the present day. During approximately the first 15 years of this period, many comic book characters were redesigned, creators gained prominence in the industry, independent comics flourished, and larger publishing houses became more commercialized.

An alternative name for this period is the Dark Age of Comic Books, due to the popularity and artistic influence of titles with serious content, such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

==Developments==
Because the time period encompassing the Modern Age is not well defined, and in some cases disputed by both fans and most professionals, a comprehensive history is open to debate. Many influences from the Bronze Age of Comic Books would overlap with the infancy of the Modern Age. The work of creators such as John Byrne (&quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;), Chris Claremont (&quot;Iron Fist&quot;, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;), and Frank Miller (&quot;Daredevil&quot;) would reach fruition in the Bronze Age but their impact was still felt in the Modern Age. &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; is the most definitive example of this impact as Bronze Age characters such as Wolverine and Sabretooth would have a huge influence on the Marvel Universe in the 1980s and beyond.

For DC, &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; is the bridge that joins the two ages. The result was the cancellation of &quot;The Flash&quot; (with issue 350), &quot;Superman&quot; (with issue 423), and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (with issue 329). The post-Crisis world would have Wally West as the new Flash, John Byrne writing a brand-new Superman series, and George Pérez working on a new Wonder Woman series. Batman would also get a makeover as the &quot;&quot; storyline would be one of the most popular Batman stories ever published.

In rough chronological order by the beginning of the trend, here are some important developments that occurred during the Modern Age, many of which are interrelated:

===Rise of independent publishers===
The late 1970s saw famed creators going to work for new independent publishers. The arrival of Jim Shooter as editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics saw the departure of key creators at Marvel such as Steve Gerber, Marv Wolfman, and others. In these new companies (Pacific, Eclipse, First) creators were free to create very personal stories. Mike Grell&#x27;s &quot;Jon Sable Freelance&quot;, Howard Chaykin&#x27;s &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, Mike Baron and Steve Rude&#x27;s &quot;Nexus&quot;, Dave Steven&#x27;s Rocketeer and John Ostrander&#x27;s &quot;GrimJack&quot; attracted some attention and garnered a number of awards. These creators were brought in by DC editor Mike Gold to create defining works such as &quot;Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters&quot; by Grell, &quot;Blackhawk&quot; by Chaykin, and &quot;Hawkworld&quot; by Truman. With Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot; (which would later receive the Pulitzer Prize), this period marks the summit of the artform per comics expert Scott McCloud.

===Fantasy and horror===
The Comics Code Authority was established in 1954 and specified that no comic should contain the words &quot;horror&quot; or &quot;terror&quot; in its title. This led EC Comics to abandon its horror comics line. Publishers such as Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics did run an expanding line of silver-age horror and &quot;mystery&quot; titles during the early 1960s, and Charlton maintained a continuous publishing history of them, during the later 1960s, a gradual loosening of enforcement standards eventually led to the re-establishment of horror titles within the DC and Marvel lineups by the end of the decade. 1970s horror anthology series merely continued what had already been established during the late 1960s, and endured into the 1980s until they were markedly transformed into new formats, many of which were greatly influenced by, or directly reprinted, &quot;pre-Code&quot; content and styles of the early 1950s.

Starting with Alan Moore’s groundbreaking work on DC&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; in 1984–1987, horror comic books incorporated elements of science fiction/fantasy and strove to a new artistic standard. Other examples include Neil Gaiman’s &quot;The Sandman&quot; (followed a few years later by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon’s &quot;Preacher&quot;). DC&#x27;s Vertigo line, under the editorship of Karen Berger, was launched in 1993, with the goal of specializing in this genre. Existing titles such as &quot;Animal Man&quot;, &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, and &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; were absorbed into this new line. Other titles later were created for the line, which continued successfully into the 2010s.

Starting in the 1990s and throughout the 2000s, a number of successful movie adaptations of comic books, partly due to improvements in special effect technology, helped to extend their market audience, attracting the attention of many new readers who previously had not been interested in comic books. This also led to an avalanche of other movie adaptations which included previously lesser known Vertigo titles, notably &quot;Constantine&quot; (based on the comic book &quot;Hellblazer&quot;) and &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;.

===Rise of antiheroes===
In the mid-1980s, Marvel antiheroes such as the X-Men&#x27;s Wolverine, the Punisher, and writer/artist Frank Miller’s darker version of Daredevil challenged the previous model of the superhero as a cheerful humanitarian. Miller also created Elektra, who straddled the conventional boundary between love interest and villain.

Two artistically influential DC Comics limited series contributed to the trend: &quot;,&quot; also by Frank Miller and &quot;Watchmen&quot; by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, both of which were series of psychological depth that starred troubled heroes.

By the late 1980s, DC had published many mature titles such as &quot;John Constantine, Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, and &quot;Lobo&quot;. They featured morally ambiguous characters such as the cynical John Constantine and the violence-loving Lobo with graphic violence and adult content that differentiated them from other mainstream titles. DC later separated these titles to their launched Vertigo imprint that publishes titles outside of the DC Universe.

By the early 1990s, antiheroes had become the rule rather than the exception; among the most popular were Marvel Comics&#x27; Cable and Venom and Image Comics&#x27; Spawn.

The trend of creating characters with more psychological depth that were less black-and-white, also affected supervillains. For example, the Joker, Batman&#x27;s nemesis, was portrayed less as an evil criminal and more as a mentally ill psychopath who cannot control his actions, Marvel Comics&#x27; galactic planet-eater Galactus became a force of nature who means no personal malice in his feedings, and the X-Men&#x27;s nemesis Magneto became more benign and sympathetic as a man who fights for an oppressed people, albeit through means that others deem unacceptable.

==Development of the X-Men franchise==

By the mid-1980s, &quot;X-Men&quot; had become one of the most popular titles in comics. Marvel decided to build on this success by creating a number of spin-off titles, sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;X-books&quot;. These early X-books included &quot;The New Mutants&quot; (which would later become &quot;X-Force&quot;), &quot;X-Factor&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, and a &quot;Wolverine&quot; solo series. There were many new popular additions to the X-Men in the 1990s, including Cable and Bishop.

By the early 1990s, X-Men had become the biggest franchise in comics, and by the middle of the decade over a dozen X-Men-related comic books, both continuing and limited series, were published each month. On an almost annual basis from 1986 until 1999, one storyline crossed over into almost every X-book for two to three months. These &quot;X-overs&quot; usually led to a spike in sales.

This sales boom resulted in a great deal of merchandising, such as action figures, video games, and trading cards. This success was thanks in no small part to the Fox Network&#x27;s animated &quot;X-Men&quot; series, which debuted in 1992 and drew in a large number of younger fans.

The sales boom began to wane in the mid to late 1990s, due to the crash of the speculators&#x27; market and the effect it had on the industry. Marvel declared bankruptcy in 1996, and as a result, scaled back all of their franchises, including X-Men. A number of &quot;X-books&quot; were canceled, and the amount of limited series published, as well as general merchandise, was reduced.

In the early 2000s, a series of blockbuster &quot;X-Men&quot; films have kept the X-Men franchise healthy, and have resulted in a larger market presence outside of comics. In 1999–2000, a new animated series, &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; debuted, while new toys have been developed and sold since the success of the first &quot;X-Men&quot; feature film. The comic books themselves have been reinvented in series such as Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;New X-Men&quot; and the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, which, like Marvel&#x27;s other &quot;Ultimate&quot; series, is an alternative universe story, starting the X-Men tale anew. This was done for &quot;X-Men&quot;, and other books because Marvel feared that the long and complex histories of the established storylines of certain titles were scaring off new readers.

===Effect on other comics===
Many series tried to imitate the model the X-Men carved as a franchise. Marvel and DC expanded popular properties, such as Punisher, Spider-Man, Batman, and Superman into networks of spin-off books in the mid-to-late 1980s. Like the X-books, some of these spin-offs highlighted a concept or supporting character(s) from a parent series, while others were simply additional monthly series featuring a popular character. In another similarity to the X-books, these franchises regularly featured crossovers, in which one storyline overlapped into every title in the “family” for a few months.

With regards to storylines overlapping, the Superman stories from 1991 to 2000 were written on a weekly basis. One needed to buy &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (and eventually, &quot;&quot;) to keep up with any existing storylines. If a collector only bought &quot;Action Comics&quot;, they would only get twenty-five percent of the story. A triangle was featured on the cover of every Superman title with a number on it. This number indicated which week of the year the Superman title was released.

==Makeovers and universe reboots==

Complementing the creation of these franchises was the concept of redesigning the characters. The Modern Age of comics would usher in this era of change. The impact of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was the first example as Supergirl died in issue 7, and long-time Flash (Barry Allen) died in issue 8. Specifically, Barry Allen signified the beginning of the Silver Age of Comics and his death was highly shocking at the time. Marvel Comics&#x27; Secret Wars would usher in a new change as well as Spider-Man would wear a black costume. This costume change led to the development of the character Venom.

The interest in the speculator market of a new Spider-Man costume led to other changes for Marvel characters in the 1980s. Iron Man would have a silver-and-red armor in issue 200. Captain America would be fired and would be reborn as the Captain, wearing a black outfit in issue 337 of the series. The Incredible Hulk would revert to his original grey skin color in issue 325. Issue 300 of the first &quot;Avengers&quot; series resulted in a new lineup including Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, of the Fantastic Four. Within the decade, Wolverine would switch to a brown and yellow costume, Thor would be replaced by Thunderstrike, Archangel would emerge as the X-Men&#x27;s Angel&#x27;s dark counterpart after serving as one of Apocalypse&#x27;s Horsemen, and many other Marvel characters would have complete image overhauls. The changes to Spider-Man, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine and most other Marvel characters would be undone in the early 1990s.

The 1990s would bring similar changes to the DC Universe, including the death of Superman and the crippling of Bruce Wayne in 1993. The only lasting change was Kyle Rayner replacing Hal Jordan as Green Lantern.

In addition to individual character or franchise/family-wide makeovers, &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; ushered in a popular trend of &quot;rebooting&quot;, &quot;remaking&quot; or greatly reimagining the publisher-wide universes every 5–10 years on varying scales. The practice of rebooting entire universes occurred frequently enough that this era has also been referred to as The Iron Age. This often resulted in origins being retold, histories being rewritten, and so forth. These reinventions could be on as large a scale as suddenly retconning seminal story points and rewriting character histories, or simply introducing and/or killing off/writing out various important and minor elements of a universe. &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; resulted in several miniseries which explicitly retconned character histories, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Superman: Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals&quot;. An example of a less ambitious scale of changes is &quot;Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters&quot;, which did not explicitly retcon or retell Green Arrow&#x27;s history, but simply changed his setting and other elements of the present, leaving the past largely intact. This trend of publisher-wide reinventions, which often consists of a new miniseries and various spinoff storylines in established books, continued for decades, with DC&#x27;s &quot;New 52&quot; in 2011 and Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; in 2015.

==Image Comics and creator rights disputes==
In the mid-1980s, artist Jack Kirby, co-creator of many of Marvel&#x27;s most popular characters, came into dispute with Marvel over the disappearance of original pages of artwork from some of his most famous titles. Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and many other contemporary stars became vocal advocates for Kirby.

By the early 1990s, these events, as well as the influence of vocal proponents of independent publishing, helped to inspire a number of Marvel artists to form their own company, Image Comics, which would serve as a prominent example of creator-owned comics publishing. Marvel artists such as &quot;X-Men&quot;’s Jim Lee, &quot;The New Mutants/X-Force&quot;’s Rob Liefeld and &quot;Spider-Man&quot;’s Todd McFarlane were extremely popular and were idolized by younger readers in ways more common to professional athletes and rock musicians than comic book artists. Propelled by star power and upset that they did not own the popular characters they created for Marvel, several illustrators, including the above three formed Image Comics in 1992, an umbrella label under which several autonomous, creator-owned companies existed. Image properties, such as &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot;, &quot;Gen13&quot;, &quot;Witchblade&quot;, and especially McFarlane’s &quot;Spawn&quot; provided brisk competition for long-standing superheroes. Image in particular is singled out by some critics for contributing to the conditions which led to the speculator market crashing, as Image titles favored alternative covers, foil covers, and other &quot;collectible&quot; comics.

Many popular creators followed Image&#x27;s lead and attempted to use their star power to launch their own series; ones for which they would have licensing rights and editorial control. Chris Claremont, famous for his long run as the writer of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, created &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot; for DC; Joe Madureira, also made popular by &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, launched &quot;Battle Chasers&quot; for WildStorm Productions; and Kurt Busiek, Alex Ross, and Brent Anderson created &quot;Astro City&quot; for Image.

==Milestone Comics and ethnic diversity==

In 1993, a coalition of African-American writers and artists started Milestone Comics, believing that minority characters were underrepresented in American superhero comics. Some of the company&#x27;s better-known series include Static, about an African-American teen who became Milestone&#x27;s key character; Hardware, an example of Afrofuturism; Icon, about an alien mimicking the appearance of an African-American; and Blood Syndicate, a series about a multicultural gang of superheroes. All of these flagship titles were co-created by Dwayne McDuffie. In 1997, the Milestone Universe merged with the DC Universe.

==Rise and fall of the speculator market==

By the late 1980s, important comic books, such as the first appearance of a classic character or the first issue of a long-running series, were sold for thousands of dollars. Mainstream newspapers ran reports that comic books were good financial investments and soon collectors were buying massive amounts of comics they thought would be valuable in the future.

Publishers responded by manufacturing collectors’ items, such as trading cards, and “limited editions” of certain issues featuring a special or variant cover. The first issues of Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;X-Force, X-Men&quot; vol. 2, and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; became some of the first and most notorious examples of this trend. Another trend which emerged was foil-stamped covers. The first Marvel comic book with a foil-stamped cover was the third volume of the &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;, issue 50 (June 1991). A glow-in-the-dark cover for &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, volume 3, issue 15 appeared as well. This led a market boom, where retail shops and publishers made huge profits and many companies, large and small, expanded their lines. Image Comics in particular became notorious for this, with many of its series debuting with alternative covers, wide use of embossed and foil covers and other &quot;collectible&quot; traits.

This trend was not confined to the books themselves, and many other pieces of merchandise, such as toys, particularly &quot;chase&quot; action figures (figures made in smaller runs than others in a particular line), trading cards, and other items, were also expected to appreciate in value. McFarlane Toys was notable for this, as it created many variations in its high-quality toys, most of which were main characters or occasional guest stars in the Spawn series.

But few, in the glut of new series, possessed lasting artistic quality and the items that were predicted to be valuable did not become so, often because of huge print runs that made them commonplace. The speculator market began to collapse in summer of 1993 after &quot;Turok&quot; #1 (sold without cover enhancements) badly underperformed and Superman&#x27;s return in &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; #500 sold less than his death in &quot;Superman&quot; #75, something speculators and retailers had not expected. Companies began expecting a contraction and Marvel UK&#x27;s sales director, Lou Marks, stated on September 29 that retailers were saying there was &quot;simply no room to display all the comics being produced&quot;. The resulting comic market crash devastated the industry: sales plummeted, hundreds of retail stores closed and many publishers downsized. Marvel made an ill-judged decision during the crash to buy Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor, which resulted in both distribution problems for Marvel and the industry&#x27;s other major publishers making exclusive distribution deals with other companies, which would lead to Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. becoming the only distributor of note in North America. In 1996, Marvel Comics, the largest company in the industry and hugely profitable just three years before, declared bankruptcy.

The crash also marked the relative downfall of the large franchises and inter-connected &quot;families&quot; of titles that led to a glut of merchandising. While the big franchise titles still have a large amount of regular titles and merchandising attached to them, all of these things were notably scaled back after the crash.

==Rise of the trade paperback format==

Although sales of individual comic periodicals dropped in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, sales rose for trade paperbacks, collected editions in which several issues are bound together with a spine and often sold in bookstores as well as comic shops. Comic book publishers began releasing trade paperbacks of collected story arcs directly after those stories&#x27; original periodical publication because a new reader could purchase the trade paperbacks and access the entire series&#x27; stories to date. &quot;The Librarian&#x27;s Guide to Graphic Novels for Children and Tweens&quot; by David S. Serchay explains: &quot;At first it was the most popular stories that were being collected, but more and more comic book stories are now being put into trades, sometimes less than two months after the &#x27;newest&#x27; issue is sold. And [...] not only recent material but a great deal of older material is finally being collected into trades&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Polygon&quot; highlighted that &quot;though this was far less common a decade ago, pretty much every monthly comic out there right now is eventually collected into trade paperback or hardcover edition that prints several issues in one package&quot;. Trade paperbacks are often even given volume numbers, making them a serialization of sorts. Due to this, many writers now consider their plots with the trade paperback edition in mind, scripting stories that last four to twelve issues, which could easily be read as a &quot;graphic novel.&quot;

In addition, the publishing format has gained such respectability as literature that it became an increasingly prominent part of both book stores and public library collections. Trade paperbacks and graphic novels are the preferred format for circulating library collections, since these collections are created to be read, and not to be retained as collector&#x27;s items or as investments. Attempts to catalog and circulate single-issue comics can pose difficult problems and the durability of the trade paperback format is an important consideration for longevity and collection development in public and school libraries. Trade paperbacks &quot;are also the primary culprit in people&#x27;s confusion of the lexicon, since &#x27;TPBs make up 95% of what many librarians refer to as graphic novels&#x27;&quot;.

Despite the growing popularity of the trade paperback, the serialized, individual issues are still considered the primary mode of sale by comics publishers, and a poorly selling series may face cancellation irrespective of trade paperback sales. However, some series &quot;survive on the popularity of their trades sales, not just in the direct market and local comic shops, but in book stores across the world&quot; and at &quot;Scholastic [book] fairs and the like&quot;.

The popularity of trade paperbacks has resulted in older material being reprinted as well. The Essential Marvel line of trade paperbacks has reprinted heroes such as Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four and has been able to introduce these Silver Age stories to a new generation of fans. These editions tend to resemble a phone book in that these are very thick books and are black-and-white (to help keep the cost down). DC Comics has followed suit by introducing a line called Showcase Presents. The first four have included Superman, Green Lantern, Jonah Hex, and Metamorpho the Elemental Man. Other characters have included Green Arrow, the Superman Family, the Teen Titans and the Elongated Man.

In 2018, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; highlighted, &quot;publishers and retailers traditionally ignore the sales of trade paperbacks when it comes to deciding whether or not a specific title is doing well. For decades, the single issue has been king, even though those sales figures are far from helpful. [...] Trade paperbacks are increasingly important as a marker of what sells, with 2016 seeing a 12% jump in trade sales over 2015 – a period when single-issue sales fell. Even 2017, which saw both trades and single issue sales fall compared to 2016, trades were down 9.38%, compared to single issues dropping 10.4%&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; emphasized, &quot;in recent years, collected issues/trade paperbacks are more popular and profitable than monthly comic book periodicals. As single-issue sales have consistently plummeted, trade paperbacks and graphic novels have filled in the gaps. From 2013 to 2018, graphic novels were the highest-selling format for comic books&quot;. According to industry reports, &quot;the massive shift to graphic novels as the preferred format for comics continued in 2019 bringing sales in the book channel above the comic store channel in North America for the first time in the history of the medium&quot; and that &quot;the sales of graphic novels were growing faster in the book trade than in comics shops&quot;.

==Comics creators&#x27; mainstream success==

While many comic book artists and writers had become well known by their readership as early as the 1940s, some comics creators in the late 1980s and the 1990s became known to the general population. These included Todd McFarlane, Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore, and Frank Miller. Some, such as Gaiman, went on to write critically and commercially successful novels. Others, like Miller, became Hollywood screenwriters and directors.

Conversely, film and TV directors and producers became involved with comics. J. Michael Straczynski, creator of TV&#x27;s &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, was recruited to write Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and, later &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; filmmaker Reginald Hudlin became the writer of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Black Panther&quot;. Joss Whedon, creator of TV&#x27;s &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, wrote Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; and &quot;Runaways&quot;, among other series. Richard Donner, who directed the Superman films of the 1970s and 1980s, became a writer on the Superman feature in &quot;Action Comics&quot; in 2006, co-writing with comics writer (and Donner&#x27;s former production assistant) Geoff Johns. Paul Dini, producer and writer of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, started writing for DC in 1994 on special projects and took the helm as writer of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in 2006.

Comics writer Peter David&#x27;s career as a novelist developed concurrently with his comic book career. &quot;Sandman&quot; writer Neil Gaiman has also enjoyed success as a fantasy writer and number one New York Times Bestseller. Michael Chabon who won the Pulitzer Prize with &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot;, a novel about the start of the Golden Age of Comic Books, then went on to write comics for DC and Dark Horse. Novelist Brad Meltzer saw success in the comics field with the controversial miniseries &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, as well as runs on &quot;Green Arrow&quot; and &quot;Justice League of America&quot;.

==Influence of other countries, genres, media and markets==
Interest in anime and manga into the United States has been known to date back as far as the mid 1970s around the American West Coast, though the mid to late 1980s would see the quiet introduction of various translated Japanese manga into North America. While not the first to release translated manga, the first company to do so to a large degree was Eclipse which introduced &quot;Area 88,&quot; &quot;Legend of Kamui,&quot; and &quot;Mai the Psychic Girl&quot;, the three titles that are generally associated with the first wave of manga translated into English. With social trends and influences like the Japan Bubble Economy of the 1980s and corporate promoted business study focuses on Japanese relations and business in universities, interest and knowledge of Japanese popular culture including anime and manga soon began to slowly but steadily spread by fans into the United States by the mid-1990s. In the aftermath of the bankruptcy of Marvel and DC and the languishing of American comics after 1996, and with the rise of the alternative media boom of the decade, interest in manga greatly increased by the 2000s. The consensus by both older and newer fans of manga often spoke of how manga&#x27;s lexicon of works ranged greatly than the often restricted variety limited to superhero stories on the American market, and provided better quality by not subjecting themselves to the censorship and oppressive standards such as the Comics Code Authority or highly conservative; predominantly white American influence that was prominent years before. During the 1990s, publishers such as Dark Horse Comics, Kodansha USA, and Viz Media were established to meet the demand for manga. Upon the 2000s, Shonen Jump would establish a North American branch by 2001. While manga translations were previously presented in the traditional American comic magazine format, the digest size publications traditional to manga have become common. As a result of demand and to respect their cultural origins, the books are presented in the original form intended to be read from right to left.

Original English-language manga, or OELs, have been prominent since before even the anime and manga boom of the dawn of the 2000s. OELs are original material written by non-Japanese authors who directly emulate manga style in both storytelling and art and openly identify their works as manga. In the 1980s, along with and Eternity Comics&#x27;s adaptation of the &quot;Robotech&quot; animated series, various other companies would release manga-style comics such as Ben Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Ninja High School&quot; and Barry Blair&#x27;s &quot;Samurai&quot;. Tokyopop was the first company on paper to contract non-Japanese artists to produce and market (Original English-language manga). Though previous manga-style comics consisted mostly of selective borrowing of manga or anime elements for a work that was not intended to be regarded as manga, their inspirations and artistic methods categorize them under the term.

In October 2019 industry analyst Milton Griepp presented data at an ICv2 conference in New York showing that for the first time in decades, the market was dominated not by traditionally American monthly comics of the superhero genre, but graphic novels and trade paperbacks of other genres, particular those aimed at younger readers, such Dav Pilkey’s &quot;Dog Man&quot; and Raina Telgemeier’s &quot;Guts&quot;, and Japanese manga and manga-inspired books. These books see high sales in bookstores, though the shift was also reflected in comics shops. According to data by Bookscan, child-oriented comics and graphic novels accounted for 41% of sell-through at bookstores, and manga is 28%, while books of the superhero genre constituted less than 10%, a drop of 9.6% year-over-year.

<doc id="1295185" wikidata="Q2557303" url="?curid=1295185" title="Life as We Know It (TV series)">
<text>Life as We Know It is an American teen drama television series which aired on the ABC network during the 2004–2005 season. It was created by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah. The series was loosely based on the novel &quot;Doing It&quot; by British writer Melvin Burgess.

==Premise==
Set at the fictional Woodrow Wilson High School in Seattle, Washington, &quot;Life as We Know It&quot; focuses on three teenage best friends–Dino Whitman, Ben Connor, and Jonathan Fields. Dino is a star ice hockey player whose parents&#x27; marriage falls apart when his mother has an affair with his hockey coach. Dino has an uneasy relationship with his girlfriend, Jackie Bradford, a soccer player. Jackie&#x27;s best friend is Sue Miller, an academic star. Ben becomes interested in Sue, who is unaware he was involved in an affair with a teacher, Monica Young. Jonathan, a clumsy jokester, is teased by Dino for his attraction to the overweight Deborah Tynan.

As part of the show&#x27;s narrative structure, characters broke the fourth wall by stepping out of the scene — of which the action proceeds behind them in slow motion — and directly addressing the camera.

== Production ==
The series was created by Jeff Judah and Gabe Sachs, who had previously worked on &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; and &quot;Undeclared&quot;. ABC greenlit a full series order for the fall season in June 2004. The show was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington by Sachs-Judah Productions and (ca)bloom!, in association with Touchstone Television, a corporate sibling of ABC, both owned by The Walt Disney Company. The school used for exterior shots, possibly interior as well, is Point Grey Secondary School in Vancouver.

== Broadcast ==
The show premiered on October 7, 2004 in the Thursday 9 p.m. time slot, airing at the same time as NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Apprentice&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series has a rating of 73% based on 22 reviews. The consensus states, “&quot;Life as We Know It&quot; might be too risqué for some viewers, but the teen drama tackles relationships in a nuanced manner.”

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a sly, sweet look at high school . . . so good that you immediately make room on your shelf for the cult-fave DVD because you know this is the kind of show that gets cancelled after five episodes.&quot; Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Gillian Flynn also gave a positive review and said the show &quot;revels in off-putting frankness.&quot;

John Doyle of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote, &quot;Most TV dramas about teenage life either paint everything in a romantic mist or present the teens as near-savages, existing in the sort of hormone-crazed universe depicted in the &quot;American Pie&quot; movies. &quot;Life as we know it&quot; falls somewhere in between. The kids are neither precocious nor too crude. They&#x27;re self-infatuated, but the realities of the world are revealed to them. This is a coming-of-age drama but it&#x27;s about formative experiences and not merely adolescent high jinks.&quot;

Samantha Bornemann of &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted that while some of the plot lines verged on predictability, with the Miss Young storyline in particular bringing &quot;the series perilously close to camp&quot;, the show &quot;is best during...little moments of communication and revelation [between its characters], allowing the teens to show their instinctual decency even as they prove exceedingly fallible human beings.&quot;

The media watchdog group the Parents Television Council protested against &quot;Life as We Know It&quot; saying that the October 2004 episode was sexually charged.

==Cancellation==
&quot;Life as We Know It&quot; was pulled from ABC&#x27;s lineup during November sweeps, but was rerun on MTV to good ratings in November and December 2004. It was ultimately cancelled by ABC in January 2005, with its final two episodes going unaired. In 2005, the series was released on DVD, which included the two previously unaired episodes. &quot;Life&quot; aired abroad after its American cancellation.

In Brazil the show aired on Sony Entertainment Television starting June 13, 2005 at 7:00pm Tuesdays. In New Zealand, the show premiered in December 2005 on TV2, scheduled against &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;. It replaced &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, another American import, but was rescheduled after four episodes because of poor ratings. The remaining episodes were rescheduled from their prime-time slot (7:30pm Friday) to midnight Saturday, then pushed back after midnight as the season progressed. The final two episodes were played in reverse order. TV2 repeated the series from the beginning during the third quarter of 2006, just after midnight Thursdays, but again played the final two episodes in reverse order.

&quot;Life&quot; was also shown in the Philippines in the free cable channel Studio 23. While there were reruns after the initial showing, the two DVD episodes weren&#x27;t released. In Portugal it is shown on SIC Radical cable channel and is popular among teenagers and young adults. In Hong Kong, it is shown on TVB Pearl and in Asia, it is shown on STAR World.

&quot;Life&quot; was also shown in South Africa on M-Net (DStv Channel 101), a subscription funded channel. The show was broadcast in prime-time and was popular. When the series &#x27;ran out&#x27;, M-Net received a large number of complaints from subscribers on their internet forums. Subsequently, the show was replayed in an 11:00am morning slot in early 2006. &quot;Life&quot; was also broadcast in 2005 on the M-Net Series channel (DStv Channel 104), a channel which is part of the DStv offering. This channel is broadcast via satellite to sub-Saharan Africa.

&quot;Life&quot; showed in Sweden on Kanal 5 during autumn and winter 2006.

In December 2006 (the beginning of the summer non-ratings period), the show began airing in Australia on the Seven Network at 10:30pm Tuesday nights. The show was also sold to FOX8, where it screened at 7:30pm Saturdays. In Ireland RTE2 showed two episodes every Monday (approximately 2:30am) from mid-January 2007. In Norway the show started airing in August 2006, but was cancelled after eight episodes

It was also broadcast in India in the 2007 fall season on the subscription channel Star World, where it ran all the episodes except the two bonus DVD ones. It is being rerun in India in the same channel in the 5:30–6:30 time slot.

&quot;Life&quot; was broadcast from January to March 2005 on Living TV in the UK. The series was later rerun on Living&#x27;s sister channel Trouble.

==Home media==
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (formerly Buena Vista Home Entertainment) released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 on August 23, 2005. It included all 13 episodes, 2 of which were unaired, on 3 discs. Bonus features included audio commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, and the producer&#x27;s photo gallery.

<text>USS &quot;Roe&quot; (DD-24) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, and later in the United States Coast Guard designated CG-18. She was the first ship named for Francis Asbury Roe.

&quot;Roe&quot; was laid down on 18 January 1909 by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company, Newport News, Virginia, launched on 24 July 1909, sponsored by Mrs. Reynold T. Hall, and commissioned on 17 September 1910.

==United States Navy==
Following commissioning, &quot;Roe&quot; conducted exercises in the Norfolk, Virginia, area until December with one interruption, a voyage to Newport, Rhode Island, and back in early November. On 17 December, she got underway for Key West and winter exercises in the Gulf of Mexico. With the spring, she returned to Norfolk and until January 1913 remained active off the mid-Atlantic and southern New England sea coasts. From January–April 1913, she participated in maneuvers in the Caribbean, then, in the fall, operated off New England. On 30 October, she arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she was placed in reserve on 3 November. In March 1914, she was assigned to the newly organized Reserve Torpedo Flotilla and until World War I rotated between reserve and active duty with the Atlantic Fleet. During the late summer and fall of 1914, she operated off the mid-Atlantic seaboard, and from February–April 1915, participated in further winter maneuvers in the Caribbean. During the summer, she was off southern New England, and in November, she put into Charleston, South Carolina, where she was given a reduced complement status.

In March 1917, &quot;Roe&quot; was placed in full commission status. With the new month, April, she was assigned to Squadron 2, Division 5, Patrol Force and ordered to assist Treasury and Labor Department officials at Wilmington, North Carolina, in preventing the destruction or escape of German merchant vessels. On the 6th, as the United States entered World War I, she sent an armed guard aboard &quot;Hohenfelde&quot; (see ). During her service in World War I, she was commanded by Captain William A. Hodgman, who received the Navy Cross for his efforts.

At mid-month, &quot;Roe&quot; was transferred to Newport, where she conducted anti-submarine patrols and carried out escort assignments for six months. On 9 November, she sailed for France where for the next year; she performed coastal patrol and escort duty.

On 5 November 1918, &quot;Roe&quot; departed Brest for the United States. She arrived at New York City on 1 December and at midmonth she returned to Charleston where she remained until July 1919. She then proceeded to Philadelphia, where she was decommissioned on 1 December and berthed with the Reserve Fleet.

==United States Coast Guard==
Designated DD-24 on 17 July 1920, &quot;Roe&quot; was activated in 1924 and transferred to the Treasury Department. From 7 June 1924 – 18 October 1930, she was operated by the United States Coast Guard. Based in Stapleton, New York, she served as part of the Rum Patrol.

On her return to the Navy, she was again berthed at League Island where she remained until sold for scrap on 2 May 1934 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

<text>Larino (; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of approximately 8,100 inhabitants in Molise, province of Campobasso, southern Italy. It is located in the fertile valley of the Biferno River.

The old town, seen from the mountains, is shaped like a bird&#x27;s wing. The new town, called Piano San Leonardo, is built on a mountainside.

== History ==

The city of Larino has been continuously inhabited for millennia. Originally settled by the Samnite and Frentani tribes of Southern Italy, the city came under the control of the Oscan civilization. In 217 BC, the Romans defeated Hannibal here, and it was later incorporated into the Roman Empire, where it was classified as a &quot;municipium&quot; and later a &quot;colonia&quot;, and added to the &quot;Secunda Regio&quot; (Apulia). 
When Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great fought for the power in Rome, the latter is said to have joined two of his legions who were encamped at Larinum. Earlier the consul Claudius marched through Larinum on his way to attack the Carthaginian Hasdrubal. The city&#x27;s name appears in the works of the ancient historians Livy and Pliny. An important senatus consultum restricting public performances by members of the Roman upper classes was found nearby.

The modern city was built in the 14th century, after the old one, about 1.5 km away, was destroyed in an earthquake after having repeatedly been sacked by the Saracens. The old Roman city of Larinum was situated along the main road to the South-East, which started on the coast in Histonium (Vasto), and ran from Larinum eastward to Sipontum. The main road also branched off at Larinum into a secondary road to Bovianum Vetus.

In 1656, a plague nearly wiped out the city. The 373 survivors were prepared to abandon the settlement, but through the vigorous efforts of then Bishop Giuseppe Catalano, they were convinced to stay, and the city grew and thrived once again.

During World War II the radio reported that Larino had been totally destroyed in a bombardment. While it was true that the Allies and the Germans were in the vicinity of the town, hostility was avoided and the town was preserved. The city faced a large exodus during the 1950–60s, due to the extreme poverty of the Molise region, and there is a large community of Larinesi living abroad, as well as their first- and second-generation descendants.

== Main sights ==

===Roman amphitheatre===
The elliptical amphitheater was built in the 1st century AD by a prominent citizen of Larino who had made his fortune in far away Rome. The arena could comfortably seat 12,000 spectators. The structure was built into a natural declivity in the terrain.

===Cathedral and Fontana Nuova===
The &quot;Fontana Nuova&quot; (&quot;New Fountain&quot; or &quot;A fonte &#x27;e Sam Parde&quot;, Saint Pardo&#x27;s fountain), now in disrepair, and the &quot;Duomo&quot; (Cathedral), made a minor basilica in 1928 by Pius XI, which is considered by some to be one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in Italy. It was built in the 10th and 11th centuries and inaugurated in 1319. It was restored and renovated many times, with the addition of a Gothic arch in 1451, a belltower in 1523 and interior renovations in the 18th century. It was likely built, in part, by architects and engineers brought in from the Angevine rulers of Naples. At that time there was a tradition of using &quot;spoila&quot;, remnants of classical buildings, and it is likely that the structure used cut stone from the classical city which existed in the area of what is now called Piano San Leonardo. One of the church&#x27;s main elements is the portal, with columns included in a blind protyrus, and examples of medieval decoration including lions, gryphons and a lunette with the Crucifixion; the portal is surmounted by a rose window in Gothic style sided by depictions of the Four Evangelists and the Agnus Dei. The Galuppi Tower (1312), across from the cathedral, has been strengthened by large square metallic plates. The tower, which was part of the old town&#x27;s defenses, was the bell tower of a now abandoned convent. The entire structure was built on the command of Pope Clement V at the very beginning of the 14th century.

Dr. Robert Gardner in his studies, noted an earlier, but less grand cathedral mirrored the design of the present gothic structure. The twin edifices were designed by Francesco Petrini at the beginning of the 14th century. These churches, like those at Lucera, Foggia, Manfredonia, Vasto, Ortona, for example, were built by the Angevin rulers in the &quot;French&quot; style.

Some features set the Cathedral in Larino apart. For one thing, it is likely built on the location of an earlier church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. For while it follows the structural guidelines common to many churches built at this time (around 1300) in Southern Italy, it is irregular and asymmetrical. The façade of the church is canted at an angle and the rows of internal columns do not match. There are fewer on one side of the structure than the other.

Recently, during work on the vaults in the Bishop’s Palace to the side of the Cathedral the vaulted ceilings were revealed. In some instances they are built of very regular Roman brick. In some other cases they are structured, in exactly the same manner, with rubble.

The cathedral in Larino is exceptional even in the sophistication of its structure and the consistency of the craftsmanship. The rather primitive wall paintings in the cathedral were a part of the approach to ecclesiastical decoration favoured by the French kings.

In Apulia external decoration was more elaborate than elsewhere featuring especially elaborate portals. This is true of Larino. According to scholars the decorative excellence of churches at Atri, L’Aquila, Penne, Larino, and Ortona were fashioned by local schools of craftsmen in some isolation from other influences. However the templates which were available were used over and over again without much evolution of the form. One explanation for this is that an &quot;imported form&quot;, not natural to the culture of the new place in which it is implemented often becomes &quot;frozen in time&quot;.

In the 1290s, not long before the construction of the Cathedral in Larino, there emerged a taste for &quot;spolia&quot;. This desire to utilize antique (from Roman times) building materials and incorporate them in the building to the ecclesiastic structures became emphasized during the reign of Charles II between 1295 and 1309. Today in Larino you can see evidence of this usage of ancient materials in the base of the Galuppi bell tower across the square from the cathedral. It is obvious that the stone was from a variety of sources. One block of material even has a deep round hole which suggests that it may have been taken from an ancient well, although local tradition holds that it was a place where orphan babies could be placed with some safety when they were abandoned by their mothers.

If an observer stands in the archway of the bell tower and looks upward you will see a series of parallel lines running up from the supporting massive cut stone base to the top of the arch. The lines were formed by the long ago disintegration of cane which was used to form the stone arch way. The cane would be bent in the desired shape (a gothic arch) and supported from beneath. Then the masons would place the rubble and mortar in shape. The first layer would be allowed to set and then the higher level would be installed, again built with a combination of rubble and cut stone placed at the edges of the structure. The cathedral before the 1960s was covered in baroque ornamentation from much later periods.

Pictures exist of the cathedral with an additional set of windows to the right and left of the great portal. If you look at the face of the wall you will notice newer rectangular stones placed where the windows once existed. To know if the windows were original to the design you would have to search out a template, possibly in Lanciano.

The bell tower of the cathedral was built later and it too incorporates classical elements in its structure.&quot;

===San Francesco===
The Franciscan church is contemporary with the cathedral, but with a simpler and more restrained monastic taste. During recent restorations, primitive wall paintings were found behind the choir. Much of its later Baroque ornamentation has been removed with recent restorations. In the exposed side wall of the church, there are three bricked-in elongated windows. The wall itself is an odd combination of cut stone, brick, and rubble. At one time it was thought that the different materials may have been caused by repair to damage caused by an earthquake, but the truth is likely that the base was made of regular cut stone. Once above the level of the base any materials could be used because they were likely faced with a plaster much as many columns from Roman times were actually built with brick with a smooth coating of cement.

The &quot;Fleur De Lys&quot; appear on the columns at the portal because the Kings and Monks who supervised construction were French. The local workers were likely employed as common labourers. The cut stone was hauled by the horse and bull drawn carts from the classical city to the construction site. Roof tiles were made in &quot;the French manner&quot; and the walls were completely covered in frescoes. San Francesco was built almost devoid of stone ornamentation. The church we see today, like so many Italian churches, was forced later to adhere to a taste for Baroque with what many moderns see as &quot;excessive decoration&quot;.

Other churches in the city include, Santo Stefano and Santa Maria della Pietà.

===Palazzo Ducale (Ducal Palace)===
Now the seat of municipal government, it was probably originally built as a Norman castle. The palace is now repainted as it was decades ago. The exterior walls are alternating panels of whitish grey and charcoal black. The upper levels, surrounding the stone windows are a combination of pink and cream. The top level, overlooking a large terrace, is faced in sunflower yellow. Later a part of the building became Albergo Moderno(Modern Hotel), is now abandoned. The structure has three distinct facades. One distinctly shows the physical structure of the original castle. The second has a renaissance feel and housed the rulers of the town. The third is a large brick neoclassical structure which was adjoined to the castle in the 19th century.

== Culture ==
The city has many fairs and festivals, notably those of San Primiano and of San Pardo. These include parties and religious processions. Traditional recipes of the town include &quot;Pigna Larinese&quot; (&quot;pigna &#x27;Arnese&quot;, a type of cake) and &quot;taralli con l&#x27;uova &quot;(&quot;i taralle cu ll&#x27;ove&quot;, egg taralli). It also has its own cultivar of olive, known as the &quot;Gentile di Larino&quot;, which is highly prized for its oil.

In the summer a series of festivals is held. May 25–27 of each year is dedicated to the Festival of San Pardo (&quot;A fest&quot;e Sam Parde&quot;). In 2005, there were over 110 carts festooned with hand-made flowers. Each wagon is pulled by two white oxen. A procession moves from the historic centre and the cathedral to the cemetery and the old church which dates from the earliest days of the Christian era. It is at once a religious event, a historic event, and a family celebration. Each cart belongs to a particular family, and the cart&#x27;s position in the procession is a sign of social standing. At Easter the Passion of Christ is re-enacted with townspeople dressed as Roman soldiers, Jewish elders, and Roman patricians. 

Christmas is celebrated with scenes from the Nativity and the installation of thousands of lights which illuminate every section of the historic center. February is celebrated with an elaborate carnival with scores of gigantic paper Mache characters on motorized floats.

<text>Broadwick Street (formerly Broad Street) is a street in Soho, City of Westminster, London. It runs for 0.18 miles (0.29 km) approximately west–east between Marshall Street and Wardour Street, crossing Berwick Street. The street extends across four separate estates, Colman Hedge Close, Little Gelding&#x27;s, Pawlett&#x27;s Garden and Pesthouse.

Broad Street was notorious as the centre of an 1854 outbreak of cholera. This outbreak killed a total of 700 people and only twelve escaped. Physician John Snow traced the outbreak to a public water pump on the street, and disabled the pump. Before this time, the disease was widely thought to be caused by air-borne &#x27;miasma&#x27;; Snow&#x27;s findings showed it to be water-borne.

A replica pump, together with an explanatory plaque, was erected close to the original location in 1992. The original pump was at the junction of Broad Street and Cambridge Street (today Lexington Street), close to the back wall of what today is the &#x27;John Snow&#x27; pub. The site is subtly marked with a pink granite kerbstone in front of the small wall plaque.

A house on the corner of Broadwick and Marshall streets was the birthplace and childhood home of William Blake.

The street crosses, or meets, Wardour Street, Duck Lane, Berwick Street, Hopkins Street, Ingestre Place, Poland Street, Lexington Street, Dufours Place, Marshall Street and Carnaby Street.

<text>Trump Tower is a 58-story, mixed-use condominium skyscraper at 721–725 Fifth Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, between East 56th and 57th Streets. The building contains the headquarters for the Trump Organization, as well as the penthouse residence of its developer, the businessman and later U.S. president Donald Trump. Several members of the Trump family also live, or have lived, in the building. The tower stands on a plot where the flagship store of the department-store chain Bonwit Teller was formerly located.

Der Scutt of Swanke Hayden Connell Architects designed Trump Tower, and Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company (now the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company) developed it. Although it is in one of Midtown Manhattan&#x27;s special zoning districts, the tower was approved because it was to be built as a mixed-use development. Trump was permitted to add more stories to the tower in return for additional retail space and for providing privately owned public space on the ground floor, the lower level, and two outdoor terraces. There were controversies during construction, including the destruction of historically important sculptures from the Bonwit Teller store; Trump&#x27;s alleged underpaying of contractors; and a lawsuit that Trump filed because the tower was not tax-exempt.

Construction on the building began in 1979. The atrium, apartments, offices, and stores opened on a staggered schedule from February to November 1983. At first, there were few tenants willing to move into the commercial and retail spaces; the residential units were sold out within months of opening. After Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign and subsequent election, the tower saw large increases in visitation, though security concerns required the area around the tower to be patrolled for several years.

==Site==

Trump Tower is at 721–725 Fifth Avenue in the northern section of Midtown Manhattan, on the east side of Fifth Avenue between East 56th and 57th Streets. It is adjacent to the Tiffany &amp; Co. flagship store to the north and 590 Madison Avenue to the east. Other nearby buildings include the LVMH Tower and Fuller Building to the northeast; the L. P. Hollander &amp; Company Building to the north; the Bergdorf Goodman Building and Solow Building to the northwest; the Crown Building to the west; 712 Fifth Avenue and the townhouses at 10 and 12 West 56th Street to the southwest; and 550 Madison Avenue to the southeast.

The building&#x27;s main entrance is on Fifth Avenue, with a side entrance on 56th Street only for residents. On the sidewalk opposite the main entrance, there is a four-sided brown-and-beige clock, which was created by the Electric Time Company and is nearly tall. In August 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the clock had been installed illegally, as the building&#x27;s owner, the Trump Organization, had neither applied for nor received a permit. The Trump Organization finally applied for a permit in 2015, but the New York City Department of Transportation reminded the Trump Organization of its &quot;2015 notification regarding unauthorized structures&quot; in July 2023.

== Architecture ==
The 58-story Trump Tower was designed by Der Scutt of Swanke Hayden Connell Architects. Developed by the real-estate developer and later U.S. president Donald Trump, it is high. The top story is marked as &quot;68&quot; because, according to Trump, the five-story-tall public atrium occupied the height of ten ordinary stories. However, several Bloomberg L.P. writers later determined that Trump&#x27;s calculations did not account for the fact the ceiling heights in Trump Tower were much taller than in comparable buildings, and the tower did not have any floors numbered 6–13. According to one author, the building may have as few as 48 usable stories. , the building&#x27;s official owner is GMAC Commercial Mortgage, according to the New York City Department of City Planning.

===Form and facade===
The 28-sided massing was intended to give the tower more window exposure. The large number of sides arises from Trump Tower&#x27;s horizontal setbacks; this contrasts with other buildings, which typically have vertical setbacks. The exception is at the base, where the southwest corner has several stepped setbacks. The Trump Organization constructed terraces on the building&#x27;s setbacks in exchange for extra floor area. These were included as part of Trump&#x27;s agreement with the city during construction. There is a terrace on the fifth floor on the northern (57th Street) side of the building, with a smaller fourth-floor terrace on the southern (56th Street) side. The fifth-floor north-side terrace had several trees and a fountain, while the fourth-floor south-side terrace has little more than a few granite benches.

Above the main entrance is a logo with brass capital letters in Stymie Extra Bold font, which reads &quot;Trump Tower&quot;. A concrete hat-truss at the top of the building, similar to one used in the Trump World Tower, ties exterior columns with the concrete core. This hat-truss increases the effective dimensions of the core to that of the building allowing the building to resist the overturning of lateral forces such as those caused by wind, minor earthquakes, and other impacts perpendicular to the building&#x27;s height.

===Structural features===
The tower is a reinforced concrete shear wall core structure. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest structure of its type in the world. Trump Tower used of concrete and 3,800 tons of steelwork. The use of a concrete superstructure was in contrast to many other skyscrapers, which were built on steel frames. Scutt said a concrete frame was easier to build and was more rigid than a steel frame was. More specifically, it employed a concrete tube structure, which had been pioneered by Bangladeshi-American structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan in the 1960s.

Trump Tower has been described as one of the city&#x27;s least energy-efficient buildings per square foot. In 2017, Trump Tower&#x27;s Energy Star score was 44 out of 100, below the city&#x27;s overall median Energy Star score and lower than the 48 out of 100 score recorded in 2015. In May 2019 it was reported that eight of Trump&#x27;s buildings in New York City, including Trump Tower, failed to meet the city&#x27;s 2030 carbon emission standards, which were implemented as part of the city&#x27;s &quot;Green New Deal&quot;. The city threatened to fine Trump Organization for each year the infractions went unfixed.

===Interior===
==== Lower stories====

Originally, Trump only wanted to build an office building on the site, but the plot was in the Fifth Avenue special zoning district, which allowed more floor area for mixed-use towers with public space. In return for providing privately operated public space (POPS), Trump received floor area ratio (FAR) zoning bonuses that amounted to , allowing him to add several floors to the building. The public spaces in Trump Tower include the main lobby, the lower-level concourse and restrooms, and two outdoor terraces on the fourth and fifth floor. Under city law, POPS must be accessible from the street, provide a place to sit, and not require the public to purchase anything.

The Trump Organization built a five-story, atrium, which serves as the tower&#x27;s main lobby. The atrium is connected to the Fifth Avenue lobby to the west and 590 Madison Avenue&#x27;s atrium to the east. Under the POPS agreement, the atrium is supposed to be open to the public from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. When the tower opened, the Fifth Avenue Association awarded the first-prize &quot;mixed use building&quot; award to the atrium, the association&#x27;s first such award in five years. Sometime prior to 2008, the Trump Organization removed the public bench and installed a counter selling Trump-branded merchandise in the public space passageway inside the Fifth Avenue entrance. They were fined $2,500 in 2008 but the counter remained. By 2015, a second counter had been added. In 2016, the Trump Organization was fined $14,000 and ordered to remove the sales counters and reinstall the bench.

The tower&#x27;s public spaces are clad in 240 tons of Breccia Pernice, a pink white-veined marble. The atrium contains a indoor waterfall along its east wall, which is spanned by a suspended walkway, shops, and cafes. The atrium&#x27;s escalators and structural columns are clad with mirrored panels. Six levels of balconies overlook the atrium. Four gold-painted elevators transport visitors from the lobby to higher floors; a dedicated elevator leads directly to the penthouse where the Trump family lived. The atrium was originally supposed to be furnished with multiple , trees, which were transported at a cost of $75,000, but Trump, who supposedly did not like how the trees looked, personally cut them down after impatiently waiting for contractors to remove them via a tunnel. Retail outlets include Gucci&#x27;s flagship store at ground level.

The terrace accessible from the fifth floor of Trump Tower is located on the roof (sixth floor) of 6 East 57th Street, with entrances from that building and from Trump Tower. The terraces on the upper floors are open during the opening hours of the retail businesses. Due to poor signage in the lobby, the upper-story POPs are difficult to find.

====Restaurants====

The building contains several establishments for eating or drinking, including 45 Wine and Whiskey (formerly Trump Bar) in the lobby, and Trump&#x27;s Ice Cream Parlor, Trump Cafe, and Trump Grill in the basement.

Trump Grill was generally panned as gaudy-looking and the food bland-tasting. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called it a contender for &quot;the worst restaurant in America,&quot; with different menus for different customers and &quot;steakhouse classics doused with unnecessarily high-end ingredients.&quot; &quot;Eater&quot; rated the food as &quot;totally unadventuresome and predictable, though competently prepared, like food you might find in a country club.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;despite what the sign reads, countless restaurants trump this spot.&quot; In December 2016, Yelp reviews of Trump Grill averaged two-and-a-half out of five stars, while Google reviews averaged three of five stars. Health inspections in 2018 reported &quot;evidence of mice or live mice&quot; in and around the kitchen, according to records obtained by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, in violations the inspectors called &quot;critical&quot;.

The Trump Bar in the lobby of the tower was remodeled and renamed 45 Wine and Whiskey in 2021 and opened in November. It featured 39 photos of Trump, and the drinks were described as overpriced.

&quot;Eater&quot; reviewed the three other establishments as well, finding them to be commonplace compared to Trump Tower&#x27;s stature. The ice cream was described as &quot;almost too soft to be scooped,&quot; and the cafe contained food such as a &quot;rubbery and overcooked&quot; hamburger patty and some &quot;inedible&quot; steak fries. The reviewers at &quot;Eater&quot; also wrote that the bar offered a small, overpriced drink menu and snacks that &quot;do little to affirm the luxury that the place aspires to.&quot; &quot;Vice&quot; magazine also reviewed the bar and found it to be overpriced, with &quot;a strong pour of watered-down vodka and a few Manzanilla olives&quot; costing twenty dollars. &quot;New York&quot; magazine, reviewing the cafe, found the food to be &quot;safe classics&quot; that contrasted with the cafe&#x27;s grandeur.

====Upper stories====
The building has thirteen office stories spanning floors 14 to 26, then another thirty-nine stories containing 263 residential condominiums on floors 30 to 68. Trump said he had placed the lowest residential story on floor 30 as part of a marketing strategy for all his towers, and that he &quot;did not see why he should be forced to call the first residential floor something mundane like the second floor, or even the 20th floor.&quot; Trump may also have numbered the residential floors because he disliked the fact that the nearby General Motors Building was taller. Many of the apartments are furnished, but some of the upper-floor commercial spaces come unfurnished. In the apartments, mirrors and brass are used throughout, and the kitchens are outfitted with &quot;standard suburban&quot; cabinets.

The NBC television show &quot;The Apprentice&quot; was filmed in Trump Tower, on the fifth floor, in a fully functional television studio. The set of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; included the famous boardroom, which was prominently featured in the television show, where at least one person was fired at the end of each episode. Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., founded in 2015 to manage Trump&#x27;s 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, was headquartered within part of the space where &quot;The Apprentice&quot; was filmed; unlike the former boardroom, the headquarters is unfurnished, with some offices containing &quot;only drywall and no door&quot;. After Trump&#x27;s successful election, the campaign was moved out of the tower and into office space in Arlington, Virginia, where his unsuccessful 2020 re-election campaign was headquartered.

==History==

===Planning===

==== Site acquisition and rezoning ====
Donald Trump had envisioned building a tower at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan since childhood, but formulated plans to develop the site only in the mid-1970s, when he was in his thirties. At the time, the flagship store of Bonwit Teller, an architecturally renowned building built in 1929, occupied the lot. The site was next to Tiffany &amp; Co.&#x27;s flagship building, which Trump considered the city&#x27;s best real-estate property. Approximately twice every year, Trump contacted Bonwit Teller&#x27;s parent company, Genesco, to ask whether they were willing to sell Bonwit Teller&#x27;s flagship store. Trump said the first time he contacted Genesco, &quot;they literally laughed at me.&quot; Genesco continued to decline his offers and, according to Trump, &quot;they thought I was kidding.&quot;

In 1977, John Hanigan became the new chairman of Genesco. He looked to sell off some assets to pay debts, and Trump approached him with an offer to buy the Bonwit Teller building. In early 1979, Genesco sold off many of the Bonwit Teller locations to Allied Stores, and the brand&#x27;s flagship building was sold to the Trump Organization for about $10 million. At the time, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States owned the land, while Genesco had a long-term lease on the land, with 29 years remaining. If Trump were to buy the building, his tower&#x27;s ownership could be transferred to Equitable in 2008, once the lease expired. Equitable initially refused to sell the land to Trump, but the Trump Organization bought the lease instead, and Equitable exchanged the land in return for a 50% stake in the construction project itself. This was more profitable for Equitable, since they were getting only $100,000 per year from Genesco for the use of the land, while a single residential condominium in the tower could be sold for millions of dollars. Trump also bought the air rights over Tiffany&#x27;s flagship store to prevent another developer from tearing down the store and building a taller building.

Trump then needed to convince the New York City Department of City Planning, Manhattan Community Board 5, and the New York City Board of Estimate to rezone the area for his planned tower. In 1979, the New York Committee for a Balanced Building Boom had opposed the planned rezoning over fears Fifth Avenue&#x27;s character would be changed by the construction of skyscrapers. Trump later said a positive review of the building by Ada Louise Huxtable, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ architectural critic, had helped secure the support of some of the more skeptical members on each committee. The deal attracted some criticism from the media. A writer for &quot;New York&quot; magazine said the approval of Trump Tower has &quot;legitimized a pushy kid nobody took seriously,&quot; while &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that Trump combined &quot;a huckster&#x27;s flair for hyperbole with a shrewd business and political sense,&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said Trump &quot;turn[s] political connections into private profits at public expense.&quot;

====Design process====

The Trump Organization closed Bonwit Teller&#x27;s flagship store in May 1979, and the store was demolished by the next year. By late 1979, Allied had leased space for a Bonwit Teller store at the building&#x27;s base. Meanwhile, Trump hired Der Scutt as the architect of Trump Tower in July 1978, a year before the Bonwit Teller site was purchased. Scutt had collaborated with Trump before to develop Grand Hyatt New York and several other projects. The architect initially proposed a design similar to Boston&#x27;s John Hancock Tower, but Trump strongly objected. He preferred a building that was both expensive and very tall, with a design that both critics and potential tenants would approve of. Trump later said that &quot;the marble in Trump Tower would cost more than the entire rent from one of my buildings in Brooklyn.&quot;

Two major factors affected Trump Tower&#x27;s construction. One was the decision to use a concrete superstructure. The other was the decision to design it as a mixed-use building as part of the Fifth Avenue special zoning district. As originally planned, the tower was to have 60 stories consisting of 13 office floors, 40 residential floors, and two floors for mechanical uses, but this was later amended. The base was to be made of limestone, while the building&#x27;s elevators were to be in a separate glass structure outside the main tower. The final plan called for the building to contain 58 stories. The lowest six floors were to be occupied by the atrium, followed by 13 office floors above it, and 39 residential floors above the office floors.

While creating the final design for Trump Tower, Scutt studied the designs of other skyscrapers, almost all having a similar architectural form. To make Trump Tower stand out from the &quot;boxy&quot; International Style buildings being erected at the time, Scutt designed the tower as a 28-faced edifice with an &quot;inverted pyramid of cubes&quot; at the base. This design received mixed reviews from critics: although it was widely praised as creative, many reviewers also believed the tower could be covered in masonry to blend in with neighboring buildings, or that its height should be reduced for the same reason. The city ultimately accepted this design.

=== Construction ===
HRH Construction was hired as the contractor on Trump Tower. The company would go on to build many of Trump&#x27;s other real-estate developments. HRH hired several dozen subcontractors to work on different aspects of the building. Barbara Res, who had worked on some of Trump&#x27;s other projects, was hired as the construction executive in October 1980. She had previously worked for HRH Construction during the building of the Citigroup Center and the Grand Hyatt. Res was the first woman assigned to oversee a major New York City construction site. She was often ignored by subcontractors and suppliers who were new to the project, as they thought the person in charge of construction was a man.

The head superintendent of the project was Anthony &quot;Tony Raf&quot; Rafaniello, who worked for HRH Construction. He was in charge of coordinating construction based on the site&#x27;s blueprints. Rafaniello was supported by five assistant superintendents, including Jeff Doynow, who was one of the first &quot;concrete supervisors&quot; to be hired for the construction of a skyscraper. After Rafaniello was hired for the Trump Tower project in September 1980, he spent a week planning a three-phase construction schedule. Once the subcontractors were hired, Rafaniello made sure they met once a week to ensure they were working on the same phase.

Trump Tower&#x27;s proposed mixed-use status posed obstacles during construction since there were different regulations for residential, commercial, and retail spaces. Several prospective commercial and residential tenants requested custom-made features, including the installation of a swimming pool for one unit, and the removal of a wall with utilities inside it for another. Trump&#x27;s then-wife, Ivana Trump, was involved in selecting some of the tower&#x27;s minor details. Donald Trump and Res agreed to fulfill many of these requests, but they did not always agree on matters of design. In one case, Trump so hated the marble slabs at some of the tower&#x27;s corners that he demanded they be removed completely, even at great cost; he eventually decided bronze panels should be placed over the marble, but Res later said she refused to buy them.

Trump Tower was one of the first skyscrapers with a concrete frame, along with Chicago&#x27;s One Magnificent Mile engineered by Fazlur Rahman Khan in 1983. The contractors had to complete a floor before they started erecting the floor above it. Concrete was more expensive in New York City than anywhere else in the United States, which raised the construction costs. All the floors above the 20th used a roughly similar design, and each of these floors could be completed within two days. However, the floors below the 20th floor were all different, so each took several weeks to erect. Trump Tower had a low number of worker fatalities during construction. One worker died during the tower&#x27;s excavation after a neighboring sidewalk collapsed. Another incident occurred when the tower&#x27;s 25th through 27th floors accidentally caught fire, slightly damaging a construction crane and delaying construction for two months. In May 1983, a glass windowpane fell from a crane installing windows on the tower, hitting two pedestrians, one of whom later died from a skull fracture.

Trump Tower was topped out by July 1982, two-and-a-half years after the start of construction. Originally, it was estimated the tower would cost $100 million to build. The total cost ended up being approximately twice that; this included $125 million in actual construction costs and $75 million for other expenditures such as insurance.

===Operation===
==== 1980s ====

Trump bought full-page advertisements in multiple newspapers and magazines to advertise his new tower. The first tenants included Asprey and Ludwig Beck, who moved into the building before its planned opening in early 1983. The grand opening of the atrium and stores was held on February 14, 1983, with the apartments and offices following shortly afterwards. The tower&#x27;s forty ground-level stores opened for business on November 30, 1983. At the building&#x27;s dedication, Mayor Koch said, &quot;This is not your low-income housing project ... of which we need many. But we also need accommodations, uh, for those who can afford to pay a lot of money and bring a lot of taxes into the city.&quot; By August 1983, the construction loan for Trump Tower&#x27;s construction had been paid off using the $260 million revenue from the sale of 85% of the 263 condominium units. Ninety-one units, representing over a third of the tower&#x27;s total housing stock, had sold for more than $1 million. The first residents were set to begin moving in that month.

Despite the destruction of the Bonwit Teller store&#x27;s building, the flagship store itself was able to keep operating at the site, having signed a lease for within the lower-levels&#x27; shopping area. The controversy over the destruction of the Bonwit Teller decorations had largely passed: in August 1983, one &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter wrote that &quot;the only negative comments about Donald Trump these days are given off the record.&quot; By then, there were forty high-end outfits that had opened stores in the tower. These included Buccellati, Charles Jourdan brands, Mondi, and Fila. Trump said in 1985 that there were more than a hundred stores wanting to move into a space in the tower. Around this time, he began describing the tower as &quot;something of a New York landmark.&quot; By 1986, between 15% and 20% of the tower&#x27;s original stores had closed or moved to another location. The commercial rents were the highest of any building along Fifth Avenue at the time, with retail space in the atrium costing per year. One writer for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine noted that as tenants were evicted from the tower&#x27;s atrium due to high rents, several of them sued the Trump Organization for issues such as overbilling and illegal lease termination.

The residential units were more successful, and 95% of the residential condominiums were sold in the first four months after it opened, despite their high prices. The cost of condominiums at the tower started at $600,000 and ranged up to $12 million, and the penthouse was sold for $15 million in 1985. The tower attracted many rich and famous residents, including Johnny Carson, David Merrick, Sophia Loren, and Steven Spielberg. In total, Trump received $300 million from the sale of the condominiums, which more than offset the $200 million cost of construction. By 1991, Trump was involved in lawsuits against residents: in October of that year, he successfully sued actress Pia Zadora and her husband, businessman Meshulam Riklis, to collect $1 million in unpaid rent.

The city government, under mayor Ed Koch, challenged the validity of the tax breaks given to Trump Tower. The government originally tried to deny a tax break on the basis that Trump Tower did not replace an &quot;underused&quot; site, as was required under the 421-a tax exemption program. The New York Court of Appeals rejected the city&#x27;s argument in 1984. Afterward, the city claimed Trump Tower&#x27;s commercial space did not qualify for the exemption, but the Court of Appeals also rejected this argument in 1988. The city government then tried to reduce the amount of the exemption based on a more stringent method of calculation. In 1990, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the New York City government had to give Trump $6.2 million in tax rebates.

==== 1990s ====

The flagship Bonwit Teller store remained as one of Trump Tower&#x27;s retail offerings until March 1990, when its parent company declared bankruptcy and closed the Trump Tower location. In July of that year, Galeries Lafayette announced that it would sign a 25-year lease to move into the space previously occupied by Bonwit Teller, a move that expanded its business to the United States while helping Trump pay off the debts incurred by the tower&#x27;s construction and operation. The new store opened in September 1991 after a $13.7 million renovation, but was unprofitable and lost a net $3.6 million in the first year alone because it had made only $8.4 million in sales.

Galeries Lafayette announced that it would be closing the Trump Tower location in August 1994, less than three years after it opened, due to its inability to pay the $8 million annual rent and taxes. Critics cited other factors, including the decision not to include merchandise from top French designers as the company&#x27;s French locations had done. The Galeries Lafayette store was replaced with a Niketown location. By this time, most of the high-end retailers had moved out of Trump Tower, having been replaced with more upper-middle-class outlets such as Coach and Dooney &amp; Bourke.

==== 2000s to present ====

In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine valued the of office space at up to $318 million; the tower itself was valued at $288 million. Trump took a ten-year, personally guaranteed $100 million mortgage loan on the building in 2012. Between 2014 and 2015, the building&#x27;s valuation rose from $490 million to $600 million, making the tower the single most expensive property under Trump&#x27;s ownership. In 2016, the tower&#x27;s value dropped from $630 million to $471 million due to a 20% reduction in the tower&#x27;s operating income and a further 8% decline in the overall value of real estate in Manhattan. Because of the $100 million debt, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine calculated that Trump&#x27;s equity stake in the tower stood at $371 million, excluding the Trumps&#x27; three-story penthouse, which has a net floor area of .

After Trump launched his 2016 presidential campaign at Trump Tower in 2015, the number of visits to the tower had risen drastically, with many of the visitors being supporters of Trump&#x27;s candidacy. Stores in the atrium sold campaign memorabilia such as hats, with the proceeds going toward funding his campaign. The tower gained popularity among New York City tourists in 2016, especially after Trump was elected president. In 2017, the city ordered the removal of two unauthorized kiosks in Trump Tower selling Trump&#x27;s merchandise. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2020 that rent from the building&#x27;s commercial spaces had earned Trump $336 million from 2000 through the end of 2018, amounting to over $20 million per year.

Wells Fargo &amp; Co., the master servicer of the $100 million mortgage loan Trump took out in 2012, placed the tower on a debt watch list in September 2021 because its average occupancy had fallen to 78.9% from 85.9% at the end of 2020. Revenue was $33.7 million in 2020, $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. By early 2024, Gucci was the only large retailer in the tower&#x27;s retail atrium, which had once contained up to 60 stores. Another analysis, publicized in February of the same year, found that the average per-square-foot cost of a condominium at Trump Tower had nearly halved from 2013 to early 2024. The decline in condo prices was attributed to competition from newer towers nearby, the age of the building, and the protests that regularly occurred outside it. In 2022, Trump refinanced the building with $100 million from Axos Bank.

==Tenants==

=== Commercial tenants ===
The Italian fashion retailer Gucci is the biggest commercial tenant, renting along Fifth Avenue since 2007. Their rent in 2019 was $440 per square foot; Gucci renegotiated the lease in 2020 and received a reduction in rent for agreeing to extend the lease beyond 2026. CONCACAF, the governing body of association football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, used to occupy the entire 17th floor. Qatar Airways, owned by the Qatari government, has rented commercial space in the tower since at least 2008, a fact that news media outlets noted when Executive Order 13769 suspended immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries but not from Qatar.

From 2008 to October 2019, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China operated a bank branch with 100 employees on three rented floors of Trump Tower, for approximately $2 million a year. The bank rented 25,356 square feet, making it the third-largest tenant after Gucci and the Trump Corporation. It paid $95.48 per square foot in 2012. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that the bank paid about $3.9 million in rent in 2017 and 2018. Eric Trump said in October 2019 that the bank was continuing to rent two floors. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; staff, by October 2020, Trump had received approximately $5.4 million from the China state-owned bank ICBC through its $1.9 million annual rent in Trump Tower.

The monthly rent paid by the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign for its Trump Tower headquarters increased from $35,458 in March 2016 to $169,758 in August. From its launch in January 2017 until the end of 2018, the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign paid more than $890,000 in rent. In March 2021, the campaign&#x27;s space on the 15th floor was taken over by one of Trump&#x27;s PACs for $37,541.67 per month. The Trump Organization has its headquarters on the 25th and 26th floors.

==== 6 East 57th Street ====
The Trump Organization holds a ground lease on an adjacent building, 6 East 57th Street. One of Trump Tower&#x27;s privately owned public spaces is located on top of this building, which housed the Niketown store starting in 1994. During and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, opponents of Trump&#x27;s election created petitions to relocate the Niketown store, whose lease ran through 2022. Nike closed the store in early 2018 as previously planned and moved to its new flagship store on Fifth Avenue in November. In 2018, Tiffany &amp; Co. subleased the space until 2022 while the neighboring Tiffany &amp; Co. flagship store was being renovated. The fashion house Louis Vuitton subleased the space in 2025 during the renovation of its own flagship store nearby.
=== Residential owners and tenants ===
==== Current ====
Donald Trump, his wife Melania, and their son Barron maintain a three-story residence on the penthouse floors, covering about . The tower was their primary residence until October 2019. The Trump Organization offices are on the 25th and 26th floors, and there is a private elevator between the penthouse and Trump&#x27;s office. Trump uses the building for meetings, such as in April 2024 with President of Poland Andrzej Duda and former Prime Minister of Japan Taro Aso.

Angelo Donghia provided the original black-and-white, brass-and-mahogany design for the penthouse, which was later replaced with a gold-and-Greek-column design after Trump reportedly saw the more lavish house of the Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi. In a 1984 article in &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, Trump&#x27;s first wife Ivana said the first floor of the penthouse had the living, dining, and entertainment rooms and kitchen; the second floor had their bedrooms and bathrooms as well as a balcony over the living room; and the third had bedrooms for the children, maids, and guests.

Other residents include the filmmaker Vincent Gallo; the art dealer Hillel &quot;Helly&quot; Nahmad, who bought a second apartment in the tower in July 2010; Juan Beckmann Vidal, the owner of the tequila brand Jose Cuervo; and the actor Bruce Willis, who bought a $4.26 million apartment in 2007.

==== Past ====
Past tenants include Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier, the ex-president of Haiti who died in 2014, who was discovered to have lived in a $2million apartment on the 54th floor in 1989, when public records in Haiti showed that he had forgotten to pay his bills. The singer Michael Jackson rented an apartment on the 63rd floor during the 1990s. The composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, known for musicals such as &quot;Cats&quot;, moved out of his 59th and 60th floor apartment in 2010 after 17 years of stating his intention to do so. Carlos Peralta, a billionaire businessman from Mexico, sold an apartment in Trump Tower in 2009 for $13.5 million. Prince Mutaib bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, reportedly lived on an entire floor in the tower. The mobster Vyacheslav Ivankov reportedly had a residence in Trump Tower in the 1990s until he was arrested and deported.

Chuck Blazer, the former president of CONCACAF, rented two apartments on the 49th floor, one occupied by himself and another occupied by his cats, for a combined $24,000 per month. The apartments and office space were described as part of an &quot;extravagant&quot; lifestyle that ultimately resulted in Blazer being apprehended and becoming an FBI informant in a corruption investigation into several soccer organizations. José Maria Marin, former president of the Brazilian Football Confederation, had been living in a $3.5 million apartment; after being sentenced to four years in prison in 2018, he was placed under house arrest at his apartment in 2020. Portuguese soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, who paid $18.5 million for an apartment in August 2015, put it on the market for $9 million in 2019 and sold it for $7.18 million in 2022.

Trump&#x27;s parents, Fred and Mary, had a second home on the 63rd floor they sometimes used when visiting Manhattan. During Trump&#x27;s presidency, the Secret Service initially used the apartment directly underneath Trump&#x27;s triplex penthouse as their command post but moved into a trailer on the sidewalk in July 2017. In April 2017, the United States Department of Defense signed an 18-month lease for space in Trump Tower to house &quot;personnel and equipment&quot; dedicated to protecting the president, paying more than $130,000 per month to an owner other than Trump or the Trump Organization. The former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who lived in the tower when he was Trump&#x27;s campaign manager, agreed to forfeit his Trump Tower condo in September 2018, as part of a plea deal made during the Special Counsel investigation of Russian ties to the 2016 election.
== Incidents ==

=== During construction ===

====Destruction of Bonwit Teller Building features====

The art dealer Robert Miller owned a gallery across Fifth Avenue from the Bonwit Teller Building. When Miller heard the building was to be demolished, he contacted Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In December 1979, Stiebel and Trump agreed that the Art Deco limestone bas-relief sculptures of semi-nude goddesses on the Bonwit Teller Building&#x27;s facade, as well as the massive ornate grille above the store&#x27;s entrance, would be removed and donated to the Metropolitan Museum. Miller had appraised the sculptures at between $200,000 and $250,000. In February 1980, Trump wrote a letter to an official at the museum, in which he stated, &quot;Our contractor plans to begin demolition on the exterior of the building in approximately three to four weeks. He has been instructed to save these artifacts and take all necessary measures to preserve them.&quot; Every week, the Trump Organization and Stiebel would meet to discuss the transport of the sculptures. However, Stiebel later said the Trump Organization never seemed to be able to agree on a specific date for their transport, and the organization had repeatedly dismissed her concerns about not having received the letter.

On April 16, 1980, the grille and sculptures were removed from the building. They were set to be transported to a junkyard and destroyed because, according to Trump, there were general hazard concerns, expense, and a possible 10-day construction delay due to the difficulty of removing them. Stiebel rode by taxicab to the building site and attempted to pay the workmen for the sculptures, but she was rebuffed. The workers in charge of demolition told her she could make an appointment to go see the sculptures, but they then canceled several appointments that Stiebel made. The workers later told her the building&#x27;s decorative grille had been transported to a New Jersey warehouse, but it was never recovered, and on May 28, Stiebel was informed the grille had been &quot;lost&quot;. On June 5, the sculptures were destroyed. Stiebel had received notice of the sculptures&#x27; pending demolition, but by the time she reached the Trump Tower site, the workmen told her they had been ordered to &quot;destroy it all.&quot; Trump later acknowledged he had personally ordered the destruction of the sculptures and grille. Trump said these &quot;so-called Art Deco sculptures, which were garbage by the way,&quot; had been informally appraised by three different individuals as &quot;not valuable,&quot; and they had pegged the sculptures&#x27; value at $4,000 to $5,000. He also told the media that carefully removing the sculptures would have cost him an extra $500,000 and would have delayed his project. In a &quot;New York Magazine&quot; article in November 1980, Trump said the decor of his Grand Hyatt New York included &quot;real art, not like the junk I destroyed at Bonwit Teller.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; condemned Trump&#x27;s actions as &quot;esthetic vandalism,&quot; and a spokesman for Mayor Ed Koch said Trump had failed his &quot;moral responsibility to consider the interests of the people of the city.&quot; Scutt was outraged by the destruction, having initially hoped to incorporate the goddess sculptures into the new building&#x27;s lobby design; Trump had rejected the plan, preferring something &quot;more contemporary.&quot; Miller lamented that such things would &quot;never be made again,&quot; and Peter M. Warner, a researcher who worked across the street, called the destruction &quot;regrettable.&quot; However, Trump later said he used the notoriety of that act to advertise more residential units in the tower.

====Unpaid laborers====
In 1983, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Trump Organization concerning unpaid pension and medical obligations to labor unions whose members helped build the towers. Trump had paid $774,000 to a window-cleaning company that employed undocumented Polish immigrants during the renovation of an adjoining building. According to the laborers, they were paid $4 an hour () for 12-hour shifts, and were not told about asbestos in the under-construction structure.

Trump testified in 1990 he was unaware that 200 undocumented Polish immigrants, some of whom lived at the site during the 1980 New York City transit strike, and worked round-the-clock shifts, were involved in the destruction of the Bonwit Teller building and the Trump Tower project. Trump said he rarely visited the demolition site and never noticed the laborers, who were visually distinct for their lack of hard hats. A labor consultant and FBI informant testified that Trump was aware of the illegal workers&#x27; status. Trump testified that he and an executive used the pseudonym &quot;John Baron&quot; in some of his business dealings, although Trump said he did not do so until years after Trump Tower was constructed. A labor lawyer testified that he was threatened over the phone with a $100 million lawsuit by a John Baron who supposedly worked for the Trump Organization. Donald Trump later told a reporter, &quot;Lots of people use pen names. Ernest Hemingway used one.&quot; After the laborers filed for a mechanic&#x27;s lien over unpaid wages, they said a Trump Organization lawyer threatened to have the Immigration and Naturalization Service deport them.

A judge ruled in favor of the Polish laborers in 1991, saying the organization had to pay the workers. The contractor was ultimately ordered to pay the laborers $254,000. The case went through several appeals by both sides as well as non-jury trials, and was reassigned to different judges several times. The original named plaintiff, plaintiffs&#x27; attorney, and two co-defendants died during the litigation. Judge Kevin Duffy compared the case unfavorably to Charles Dickens&#x27; fictional case &quot;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&quot; in June 1998, when he was assigned the case after the previous presiding judge had died. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in 1999, and its records were sealed. In November 2017, U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska ordered the settlement documents unsealed. In the settlement, Trump agreed to pay a total of $1.375 million, which, according to the plaintiffs&#x27; lawyer, was the full amount that could have been recovered at trial.

====Other incidents====

In one case, Trump sued a contractor for &quot;total incompetence.&quot; Construction was also halted twice because minority rights&#x27; groups protested outside the Trump Tower site to condemn the shortage of minority construction workers.

Trump was also involved in a disagreement with Mayor Koch about whether the tower should get a tax exemption. In 1985, Trump was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the state in the New York State Court of Appeals concerning the payment of a 10% state tax in the event that a real estate property is transacted for $1 million or more. The exemption was reported as between $15 million and $50 million. The tax on Trump Tower was upheld in a 4-to-1 decision.

The City of New York granted Trump permission to build the top twenty stories of the building in exchange for operating the atrium as a city-administered, privately owned public space. In the lobby of the building are two Trump merchandise kiosks (one of which replaced a long public bench) operating out of compliance with city regulations. The city issued a notice of violation in July 2015, demanding the bench be put back in place. Although the Trump Organization initially said the violation was without merit, a lawyer speaking for Trump&#x27;s organization stated in January 2016 that the kiosks would be removed in two to four weeks, before an expected court ruling.

Trump maintained a connection with organized crime members to supply the building&#x27;s concrete. According to former New York mobster Michael Franzese, &quot;the mob controlled all the concrete business in the city of New York,&quot; and that while Trump was not &quot;in bed with the mob ... he certainly had a deal with us. ... he didn&#x27;t have a choice.&quot; Mafia-connected union boss John Cody supplied Trump with concrete in exchange for giving his mistress a high-level apartment with a pool, which required extra structural reinforcement. A 1992 book by journalist Wayne Barrett concludes that &quot;Trump didn&#x27;t just do business with mobbed-up concrete companies: he also probably met personally with [Anthony] Salerno at the townhouse of notorious New York fixer Roy Cohn ... at a time when other developers in New York were pleading with the FBI to free them of mob control of the concrete business.&quot; Barrett questioned some of Trump&#x27;s business dealings in a &quot;Daily Beast&quot; article in 2011, and alleged that concrete was one of &quot;several dozen&quot; suspected mob connections Trump had. Trump admitted in 2014 that he had &quot;had no choice&quot; but to work with &quot;concrete guys who are mobbed up.&quot;

=== Issues during Trump presidency (2017–2021) ===

==== Claims made by Trump ====

In March 2017, Trump wrote several posts on Twitter claiming former president Barack Obama had wiretapped phones in the tower toward the end of the 2016 campaign. An Obama spokesperson refuted the claims and, during a subsequent meeting with the House of Representatives&#x27; Intelligence Committee that discussed the issue, FBI Director James Comey informed the committee that there was no evidence of wiretapping in the tower.

Trump also claimed to own the painting &quot;Two Sisters (On the Terrace)&quot;, an 1881 work by the French Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The original work hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago. In October 2017, Timothy L. O&#x27;Brien said that during his interviews with Trump for the book &quot;TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald&quot;, he asked Trump about the copy of &quot;Two Sisters&quot;, which was then on Trump&#x27;s plane. Trump repeatedly said his copy was the genuine work, despite O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s statements to the contrary. By then, the Renoir copy was hanging in Trump&#x27;s penthouse office. The Art Institute of Chicago released a statement refuting Trump&#x27;s claim that his Renoir copy was the genuine one.

====Security issues====
On August 9, 2016, a man posted a viral video on YouTube, claiming to be an independent researcher who wanted to speak to Donald Trump. The next day, a man (suspected to be the same person as identified in the YouTube video) climbed from the 5th to the 21st floors using industrial suction cups for aid climbing, though he was arrested after nearly three hours.

Serious issues concerning safety and security in the building arose after Trump became president-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower served as a rallying point for protests against Trump after the election&#x27;s results were announced, requiring the deployment of security measures. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, but the eastern part of the street was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers of the Gucci and Tiffany stores in Trump Tower&#x27;s lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent car bombs. Fire protection was also provided for the tower whenever Trump visited it. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House&#x27;s West Wing.

The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it expected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, subsequently revised to $24 million. As a result of the heavy security, businesses around the tower saw decreased patronage due to less foot traffic in the heavily secured area. Despite the heavy security after the 2016 election, there have been some detentions and arrests related to the increased security at the tower. On December 6, 2016, a woman reached the 24th floor—two floors below Donald Trump&#x27;s office—before being stopped by Secret Service officers. A week later, a Baruch College student was arrested at Trump Tower and was found with multiple weapons. The day afterward, NYPD detained another man who wanted to meet Trump, reportedly got angry, and threw a wine glass on the lobby floor.

Protests around the tower subsided after Trump&#x27;s inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, security measures around the tower had been loosened, as they were only in place when Trump was physically on site. However, several businesses at the tower&#x27;s base had closed by then because of a reduction in the number of customers. After Trump&#x27;s presidency ended in January 2021, the vehicular barricades blocking access to 56th Street from Fifth to Madison Avenues were removed.

====Other incidents====

At around 5:30 p.m. (EDT) on April 7, 2018, a 4-alarm fire broke out in an apartment in the tower&#x27;s 50th floor, killing a resident and injuring six firefighters. In a Twitter post, Trump attributed the fire&#x27;s limited damage to the building&#x27;s design. The only person to die was 67-year-old Todd Brassner, an art dealer known for his association with Andy Warhol. The residential units did not contain sprinklers because the structure had been built before 1999, when the city passed a law requiring sprinklers in residential units; Trump had lobbied against the proposal. The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) subsequently announced that the fire had been accidentally caused by power wires that had overheated. The April 2018 fire followed a minor electrical fire at the tower earlier that year, which had injured three people.
In July 2020, activists including New York City mayor Bill de Blasio painted the words &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; in giant letters on Fifth Avenue directly in front of the building. The project was announced in response to the George Floyd protests in New York City, a series of pro-police-reform protests that started after the murder of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis, in May 2020. Trump expressed his opposition to the mural after it was announced.

== Impact ==

===Critical reception===

In a 1982 review of the building, &quot;New York Times&quot; architecture critic Paul Goldberger contrasted the &quot;reflective&quot; Trump Tower with the nearby postmodern 550 Madison Avenue building. In a later review just before the tower opened, Goldberger said the tower was &quot;turning out to be a much more positive addition to the cityscape than the architectural oddsmakers would have had it&quot;. According to Goldberger, the indoor atrium might become &quot;the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years&quot; because the marble and brass made it &quot;warm, luxurious and even exhilarating&quot;, although it was &quot;a bit too high and narrow&quot; and with little room for crowds. However, he criticized the &quot;hyperactive&quot; exterior of the tower, contrasting it with Tiffany&#x27;s &quot;serene,&quot; solid facade next door, as well as the narrowness of passageways within the atrium, saying it created &quot;little room for milling or casual strolling.&quot;

In a 1984 article, Ada Louise Huxtable, &quot;The New York Times&quot; architecture critic from 1963 to 1982, was quoted by &quot;New York Times&quot; writer William E. Geist as saying that the building was a &quot;dramatically handsome structure.&quot; Huxtable responded that the comment had been written in 1979 about the &quot;proposed faceted shape of the building&quot; and that the finished tower was a &quot;monumentally undistinguished one&quot;. She also wrote that the atrium was &quot;an uncomfortable place, awkwardly proportioned in its narrow verticality&quot;, calling it a &quot;pink marble maelstrom&quot; and asking Trump to remove the quote from its wall. Geist called the tower a &quot;Xanadu of conspicuous consumption&quot; and described it as &quot;preposterously lavish&quot; and &quot;showy, even pretentious.&quot; Architect Gregory Stanford described the atrium as &quot;pretty horrible.&quot;

The fifth edition of the &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot;, published in 2010, described Trump Tower as a &quot;fantasyland for the affluent shopper&quot; hidden by &quot;folded glass,&quot; with the Trump theme evident throughout the building. Comparing the building&#x27;s interior design to alcoholic drink brands, the authors wrote that the design was less like a high-end &quot;Veuve Clicquot&quot; and more like a generic &quot;malt liquor.&quot; &quot;Fodor&#x27;s New York City 2010&quot; described Trump Tower&#x27;s &quot;ostentatious atrium&quot; as an example of the &quot;unbridled luxury&quot; of the 1980s, characterized by &quot;expensive boutiques and gaudy brass everywhere.&quot; The tower&#x27;s public atrium, along with that of Citigroup Center a few blocks away, was described as a convenient public area.

&quot;Frommer&#x27;s&quot; called the tower a &quot;bold and brassy place&quot; whose golden sign &quot;practically screams &#x27;Look at me!&#x27;&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Insight Guides&quot;″ 2016 edition mentioned Trump Tower as &quot;worth stopping by for a glimpse of the opulence synonymous with Manhattan in the 1980s&quot; and that viewers of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; would recognize the atrium and the waterfall.

=== In popular culture ===
Trump Tower served as the location for Wayne Enterprises in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;. In a 2012 vlog post on the Trump Organization&#x27;s YouTube channel, Trump referred to the movie as &quot;really terrific&quot; and that &quot;most importantly Trump Tower—my building—plays a role.&quot; Other films have used Trump Tower as a filming location as well. For instance, the 2010 comedy film &quot;The Other Guys&quot; contains a car chase scene that has Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s character drive his car into Trump Tower. The penthouse in Trump Tower was used as a filming location for the action film &quot;Self/less&quot; (2015).

&quot;Trump Tower&quot;, a romance novel by Jeffrey Robinson, chronicles the sexual activities of fictional characters living in the tower. News media reported on the novel&#x27;s existence during the last week of the 2016 presidential campaign. The novel was never formally published but is registered as having an International Standard Book Number. For unknown reasons, some versions of the novel are advertised with Trump as the author.

Trump Tower is featured on the cover of the 1997 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and is depicted in the 2008 sequel &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; and its episodes &quot;The Lost and Damned&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Gay Tony&quot; as Cleethorpes Tower.

<text>Coca-Cola HBC AG, also known as Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company or just Coca-Cola Hellenic, is the world&#x27;s third-largest Coca-Cola anchor bottler in terms of volume with sales of more than 2 billion unit cases. Coca-Cola HBC&#x27;s shares are primarily listed on the London Stock Exchange with a secondary listing on the Athens Stock Exchange. The company is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Coca-Cola HBC has been named the industry leader among beverage companies in the 2014 Dow Jones Sustainability Index and is also included in the FTSE4Good Index.

==History==
&quot;Hellenic Bottling Company S.A.&quot; (Greek: Ελληνική Εταιρεία Εμφιαλώσεως) was incorporated under the laws of Greece in 1969, with headquarters in Athens. The Coca-Cola Company granted to the company its bottling rights in the country in 1969. In August 2000 Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. acquired Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd, the former European operations of Coca-Cola Amatil, and formed &quot;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A.&quot;

In October 2012, the company announced that it was moving its operational headquarters to Switzerland and would switch its main market listing to London. This was a major blow to the Athens stock market, as Coca-Cola Hellenic was its largest listed company by value. Reasons for the move included better access to financing and a move away from crisis ridden Greece, which had prompted ratings agencies to downgrade its credit over the summer to three notches above &quot;junk&quot; level.

On 29 April 2013 Coca-Cola HBC AG, now a Swiss holding company, was admitted to the London Stock Exchange’s main market.

On 11 September 2013 Coca-Cola HBC AG announced its inclusion into the FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share indices. Coca-Cola HBC was named the industry leader among beverage companies in the 2014 Dow Jones Sustainability Index.

On 24 July 2014 Coca-Cola HBC AG announced its delisting of its American depositary receipts (ADRs) from the New York Stock Exchange, the termination of its ADR programme, and the deregistration and termination of its reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In October 2017 the company&#x27;s chief executive officer, Dimitris Lois, died after a period of illness. On 7 December 2017, Zoran Bogdanović was appointed as new chief executive officer by the board of directors.

In January 2019, the Coca-Cola HBC announced that its carbonated water brand Valser would use captured carbon from the direct air capture company Climeworks, and in 2021, a Coca-Cola HBC official stated in an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that 30 percent of their production was done with captured carbon from Climeworks.

On 18 February 2019, the company announced a deal valued at €260 million to acquire Serbian food company Bambi from Mid Europa Partners.

== Criticism ==
The Hellenic Bottling Company (HBC) faced criticism for continuing its operations in Russia after the country’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Despite pressure from global groups to stop operating in Russia, HBC remained active there, leading to calls for boycotts and public backlash. This controversy was part of a wider discussion about whether companies should continue business in countries involved in conflicts.

==Operations==
Coca-Cola HBC operates in 29 countries in 3 continents; its well established markets include Greece (its headquarters before 2013), Cyprus, Ireland, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, its developing markets include Poland, the Baltic States, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Croatia. Its emerging markets include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Belarus, Montenegro, Armenia, Moldova, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Nigeria and Egypt.

The company&#x27;s stock is 23.3% owned by the Kar-Tess Holding (a Luxembourg company) and 23.2% by The Coca-Cola Company. The remaining 53.5% are in free float, of which about two-thirds are held by UK and US institutional investors.

=== Coca-Cola HBC in Russia ===
On 26 August 2022, it was announced that the Russian division of Coca-Cola HBC would be renamed &quot;Multon Partners&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Terry&quot; (DD-25) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I, and later in the United States Coast Guard, designated CG-19. She was the first ship named for Edward A. Terry, and the first ship commanded by future Fleet Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King.

&quot;Terry&quot; was laid down on 8 February 1909 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company, launched on 21 August 1909, sponsored by Mrs. George Henry Rock, and commissioned on 18 October 1910, Lieutenant Commander Martin E. Trench in command.

==United States Navy==

===Pre-World War I===
Following trials off the east coast, &quot;Terry&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet Torpedo Flotilla in winter operations in Cuban waters. She conducted both torpedo exercises with the flotilla and general maneuvers with the Fleet as a whole. In 1911 &quot;Terry&quot; made the first airplane rescue at sea, saving the life of James McCurdy 10 miles from Havana, Cuba. The routine of winter maneuvers in the Caribbean alternated with spring and summer operations along the New England coast continued until November 1913, when she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina for overhaul.

Soon after entering Charleston Navy Yard, &quot;Terry&quot; was placed in reserve. Though still in reserve after her overhaul was completed, &quot;Terry&quot; continued to be active. During 1914, she patrolled the coast of Florida, and by February 1915, she was back in Cuban waters for winter maneuvers. That summer, &quot;Terry&quot; steamed as far north as Newport, Rhode Island to conduct another round of torpedo exercises. Upon completion of the mission, she returned to her base at Charleston.

By 1 January 1916, the torpedo boat destroyer was operating with a reduced complement destroyer division. On the 31st, she cruised with units of the Atlantic Fleet to Key West, Florida. In May, she steamed to Santo Domingo. On 10 June, while maneuvering in the inner harbor at Puerto Plata, she struck a reef and settled until the greater part of the main deck was submerged. On the 13th, under the supervision of the commanding officer of , &quot;Terry&quot;″s officers and men joined the staff of a wrecking company in salvage operations. The warship was refloated on 26 June, temporarily repaired by 7 July, and returned to Charleston Navy Yard on 15 July.

===World War I===
America&#x27;s entry into World War I saw &quot;Terry&quot; undergoing extensive repairs at Charleston. Upon completion, she began patrolling under Lieutenant John F. Shafroth Jr. along the Atlantic coast and escorting merchantmen bound for Europe. In January 1918, &quot;Terry&quot; put to sea for operations with the destroyer force based at Queenstown, Ireland. There, she escorted convoys through the submarine-infested waters surrounding the British Isles. Her tour of duty at Queenstown was a relatively peaceful, though rigorous, one. While she never sighted a German U-boat nor engaged in combat operations, on one voyage she escorted a convoy which lost one ship to a submarine. On another occasion, 19 March 1918, she assisted with casualties after that destroyer was damaged by an accidental depth charge explosion.

==United States Coast Guard==
In December 1918, &quot;Terry&quot; returned to the United States, and after 11 months of extremely limited service, she was decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 13 November 1919.

She remained there until she was transferred to the Coast Guard on 7 June 1924. Based in New York City, she served as part of the Rum Patrol.

She served in the Coast Guard until 18 October 1930, when she was returned to the Navy and restored on the Navy list in a decommissioned status, listed as a &quot;vessel to be disposed of by sale or salvage.&quot; On 2 May 1934, &quot;Terry&quot; was sold for scrapping. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 June 1934.

<doc id="1295245" wikidata="Q6945025" url="?curid=1295245" title="My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss">
<text>My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss is an American reality television series broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). The series premiered on November 7, 2004, while its tenth and final episode aired on December 12, 2004. Filmed in Chicago, Illinois, the series depicted twelve contestants in competition for a position at a venture capital firm.

Similar to &quot;My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance,&quot; it was a parody of shows such as &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; The contestants performed several tasks that they were all told would help them win a job at the Chicago-based conglomerate IOCOR and a $250,000 prize. However, none of the contestants knew that the company – and the position – were fake. The show was usually punctuated by the actions of the &quot;boss&quot; Mr. N. Paul Todd, whose name was an anagram of that of Donald Trump. The contestants learn about his multibillion-dollar venture capital firm IOCOR, and in any episode, he or a member of his &quot;family&quot; could usually be found doing something either to unsettle the contestants or to test the limit of their blindness to truth. The show received low ratings in the United States and was canceled after five episodes. Fox released the remaining 5 episodes online in late March 2005. In 2005, &quot;My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss&quot; was one of several television programs cited in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Writers Guild of America concerning labor law violations.

==Format==

The rules of the game were similar to &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; The teams would then compete in a challenge test the contestant&#x27;s skills in business-related objectives - however, the tasks are absurd in nature, included selling hot soup on a hot day, creating and selling art they made out of scraps and promoting other ridiculous products. The members of the losing team met Mr. Todd in the boardroom on the next day, where he derided their performance. The team boss nominated two teammates for elimination – Unlike &quot;The Apprentice&quot; (where the team leader is also eligible for elimination alongside their nominees),the losing boss is awarded total Immunity from that week&#x27;s elimination because Mr. Todd explained that, in real life, the boss is never held responsible. 
The audience would then see N. Paul Todd referring to &quot;the real boss&quot; for the decision on who was to go between the bottom 2. The player not eliminated became the team boss, and the winning team named a new team boss.

The real boss was not seen or heard until the final episode and was kept a complete secret from the contestants. The official website suggested that the real boss could be Donald Trump&#x27;s ex-wife Ivana Trump or Oprah Winfrey, although David Hickman did refer to the boss as a &quot;him.&quot; The real boss gave no reason for the decision, so Todd was given free rein to make it up as he went along. In the final episode, &quot;the real boss&quot; was revealed to be a chimpanzee who responded to the name of &quot;Mowgli&quot; and who made his decisions by spinning a wheel with the names of the contestants.

==Production==
N. Paul Todd was played by actor William August, a graduate of Harvard University and an experienced California attorney. August described Todd as a man who &quot;probably has a number of sexual harassment lawsuits pending.&quot; A variety of assistants helped Mr. Todd with his contests. His alleged Vice President Jamie Samuels is sent to hate the women, while the COO David Hickman is &quot;a little too excited about these fresh-faced young men.&quot; Mr. Todd also relies on his wife Lynn and his son Kent to help judge the competition when a member of the executive team is not available.

Fox originally announced the legal reality television series &quot;The Partner&quot; for a premiere date of November 7, 2004, however, it opted to broadcast &quot;My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss&quot; instead. Gail Berman explained &quot;We had a lot of fun with &quot;Fiance&quot;, and this seemed like the next logical take on what’s going on in reality right now&quot;.

==Cast==
==Contestants==

==Teams==
The contestants were initially split into a male and female team. Each team was responsible for naming their opponent. The men named the female team Femron, a portmanteau of female and Enron. The women named the male team Concad, a portmanteau of con and cad.

The teams were re-organized in episode 4 based on the contestants&#x27; attractiveness. At the beginning of episode 8, the remaining five players were combined into a united team for an elimination, where Damien was named team boss. Afterwards, the four players left over were split into two teams for the episode&#x27;s challenge. Following that challenge, the three finalists were on their own.

: The contestant won the competition.
: The contestant won as team boss on his/her team.
: The contestant lost as team boss on his/her team - but was awarded immunity per the rules.
: The contestant was on the winning team for this task.
: The contestant was on the losing team for this task.
: The contestant was brought to the final boardroom.
: The contestant was fired.
: The contestant won a task granting him/her immunity.

==Episodes==
==After the show==
Annette became a professional model, and ironically, later appeared as &quot;Trump&#x27;s Executive Assistant&quot; (boardroom lobby receptionist) on several episodes of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice.&quot; Kerry wrote a book. As of 2007, Elli remained the president of Eye5. Jamie Denbo and Kent Sublette both moved on to late night television programs, with Denbo being featured on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and Sublette joining the writing staff of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2007. Robert appeared on the 2014 reality show &quot;Utopia&quot;.

<doc id="1295266" wikidata="Q4867380" url="?curid=1295266" title="Basilica of Saint Hyacinth">
<text>The Basilica of Saint Hyacinth () is a historic church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, located at 3636 West Wolfram Street in the Avondale neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois.

It is a prime example of the Polish Cathedral style of churches in both its opulence and grand scale. Along with such monumental religious edifices as St. Mary of the Angels, St. Hedwig&#x27;s, and St. Wenceslaus, it is one of the many monumental Polish churches visible from the Kennedy Expressway.

==History==

Founded in 1894 by Resurrectionsists from the city&#x27;s first Polish parish, St. Stanislaus Kostka, St. Hyacinth became the center of Chicago&#x27;s most well-known Polish Patch, Jackowo. The parish has been intimately tied in with Chicago&#x27;s Polish immigrants, particularly those who arrived in the Solidarity and post-Solidarity waves of Polish migration to Chicago in the 1980s. On June 26, 2003, Pope John Paul II granted the designation of minor basilica, the third church in Illinois to achieve this status. On November 30, 2003, Cardinal Francis George , officially proclaimed St. Hyacinth Church a basilica of the Archdiocese of Chicago.

Neighboring St. Wenceslaus parish was founded in 1912 as a Polish parish to relieve overcrowding at St. Hyacinth parish.

The 1999 film &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; was partly filmed at St. Hyacinth Basilica.

==Architecture==

The church was designed by the architectural firm of Worthmann &amp; Steinbach who built many of the magnificent Polish Cathedrals in Chicago. The church structure—a red-brick edifice in the classical revival style—has an ornate interior of Baroque influence. Groundbreaking occurred on April 30, 1917, and the cornerstone was laid on October 21, 1917. Completion of the building was delayed for years by financial and construction difficulties, with the first Mass celebrated in the structure not taking place until August 7, 1921. Official dedication occurred on October 16, 1921, with Archbishop Cardinal George W. Mundelein presiding.

St. Hyacinth&#x27;s recognizable three-towered façade is rarely seen in American church architecture as well as the Baroque period that its style is modeled on. The church bells are a product of the McShoe Bell Foundry of Baltimore, Maryland were blessed and placed in the steeples in April 1924.
St. Hyacinth&#x27;s bears a striking similarity to St. Mary of the Angels, which was designed by the same architects at about the same time and use the same combination of stone, glazed terra-cotta and brick. Also like at St. Mary of the Angels, much of the church&#x27;s interior was decorated by John A. Mallin, who decorated many other churches in Illinois, with two years of planning and another two years to execute the project. St. Hyacinth&#x27;s is also home to the masterworks of such renowned painters as Tadeusz Żukotyński and Mary Stanisia. Beginning in the mid-1990s, and taking almost a decade, the interior was renewed thoroughly, much of the mural work being performed by Conrad Schmitt Studios of Wisconsin.

The stained glass windows have been identified as prepared by Meyer Co. of Munich, Germany, and some by the Zettler Co. of New York were installed in 1921. The church&#x27;s organ is a mid-sized Kilgen organ (of St. Louis, Missouri) with 34 ranks was likewise installed in the church in 1921. The Stations of the Cross were likely assembled in Austria in the 1830s.

A number of statues are found within the basilica&#x27;s interior. A bas-relief of Saint Hyacinth hangs above the main altar, as well as full statues of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Figures of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Blessed Mother (Immaculate Conception) are found at lesser side altars, along with a figure of Our Lady of Sorrows as a Pietà in the church&#x27;s eastern alcove. Additionally, sculptures of Saint Joseph, Saint Ann, the Infant of Prague, Saint Maximilian Kolbe, Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint Barbara and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux are spread throughout the sanctuary.

The large saucer dome which hangs over the church&#x27;s crossing has a gigantic mural covering some with over 150 figures, depicting saints, clergy and laity.

A large icon of Our Lady of Częstochowa that was brought in from Poland occupies the shrine in the basilica&#x27;s western transept. The icon, which had been blessed by Pope John Paul II, is crowned in keeping with Roman Catholic tradition, with the Virgin Mary&#x27;s crown measuring nearly a foot long while the Infant Jesus&#x27;s crown being slightly smaller in size, each one bookended by bas-relief sculpted angels. Both crowns were crafted by Adam and Kathy Karbownik who melted down the gold and set the gemstones in them, while the jewelry used in the crowns was donated by thousands of parishioners with the gold alone weighed in at ten pounds
Three pairs of monumental bronze doors were hung along the main entrance at the basilica&#x27;s northern end by famed Polish sculptor Czesław Dźwigaj, well known for also casting the monument of Christ the King in Cicero in front of the church of St. Mary of Częstochowa as well as the Tolerance Monument that was unveiled in Jerusalem.

Monuments to Pope John Paul II, and Father Jerzy Popiełuszko, as well as a memorial to parishioners who served in the Blue Army during World War I can be found in the neighboring &#x27;Garden of Memory&#x27;.

==Center of Chicago&#x27;s Polonia==
Due to St. Hyacinth&#x27;s impressive size and history as the center of the neighborhood of first arrival for countless Polish Americans, the Basilica is considered to be the center of Chicago&#x27;s Polonia, or Polish community.

This has brought notable visitors to St. Hyacinth&#x27;s who come here to reach out to Chicago&#x27;s Polish community. General Józef Haller, Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk, Nobel Peace Prize winner and former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa, and former Premier Jarosław Kaczyński as well as his deceased twin brother President Lech Kaczyński have paid official visits to St. Hyacinth&#x27;s. Other famous Solidarity activists such as Anna Walentynowicz, Zbigniew Romaszewski and Antoni Macierewicz have visited the Basilica as well. Famous clergy have also visited, including the Servant of God Jan Cieplak as well as the future Pope John Paul II, who trekked to St. Hyacinth&#x27;s several times as the Archbishop of Cracow and referred to his gatherings there during his 1979 pilgrimage to Chicago.

St. Hyacinth&#x27;s also served as the place for local and national political elites to publicly cavort for the support of the Polish American electorate with politicians, their first stop as they would tour Chicago&#x27;s Polish Village along with an obligatory meal at one of the local Polish restaurants. President George H. W. Bush attended mass at St. Hyacinth&#x27;s twice, first as Vice President in 1985, as well as during his 1988 campaign. Purportedly, violence almost broke out as supporters of Lyndon LaRouche protesting outside the basilica were not looked at very kindly by local Poles, who had a reverence for the candidate they saw as the best hope against the loathed Communist regime in Poland.

==Relics==
St. Hyacinth Basilica has an impressive collection of relics of saints of the Roman Catholic Church. A total of 121 relics are encased and presented to the faithful on All Saints&#x27; Day, as well as the memorial day of each saint. Among them are:
*St. Hyacinth

==St. Hyacinth&#x27;s today==
St. Hyacinth is located in Chicago&#x27;s Avondale neighborhood. About 8,000 worshippers attend mass every weekend. In keeping with customs brought to the area by Polish immigrants, the area is also known as &quot;Jackowo&quot;, as &quot;Jacek&quot; is Polish for the proper name &quot;Hyacinth&quot;. Naming neighborhoods or geographical areas after the local parish church is a widespread habit of Polish Catholics.

St. Hyacinth once had a thriving elementary school. In the 60&#x27;s enrollment was over 2,500 students. On October 29, 2014, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced the closing of the school after the 2014–2015 school year. Enrollment was only 154 students.

<doc id="1295270" wikidata="Q7876900" url="?curid=1295270" title="Udal law">
<text>Udal law is a Norse-derived legal system, found in Shetland and Orkney in Scotland, and in Manx law in the Isle of Man. It is closely related to Odelsrett; both terms are from Proto-Germanic *&quot;Ōþalan&quot;, meaning &quot;heritage; inheritance&quot;.

==History==
Udal law was codified by the Norwegian kings Magnus I and Magnus VI. The Treaty of Perth transferred the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Man to Scots law, while Norse law and rule still applied for Shetland and Orkney.

The courts of Scotland have intermittently acknowledged the supremacy of udal law in property cases up to the present day. Major differences from Scots law include shore ownership rights, important for pipelines and buried cables.

Udal law generally holds sway in Shetland and Orkney, along with Scots law.

==Description==
Not all land in Shetland and Orkney can be described as falling under udal tenure. The type of tenure depends on how the title arose:

#Unwritten udal title, while rare, does exist, for udal law did not require written title deeds.
#Recorded udal titles, as entered in the Sasine Register, provide proof by prescription for the purposes of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973.
#Some udal proprietors resigned their lands to the Crown in exchange for a grant of feudal title to the &quot;dominium utile&quot;, thus removing the land from udal law.
#Where some feu dispositions arose in quasi-feudal circumstances, such as sales under the right to buy legislation with respect to council houses, the terms of the relevant deed will govern which tenure applies.

The udal tenant held without charter by uninterrupted possession on payment to the Crown, the kirk, or a grantee from the Crown of a tribute called skat (), now meaning &quot;tax&quot;. This is cognate with the English term scot, which referred to a similar payment), or without such payment, the latter right being more strictly the udal right. They were convertible into feus at the option of the udallers. Succession law had unique traits, as the eldest son inherited the father&#x27;s main residence, while the rest of the property was shared among siblings, daughters inheriting half as much as sons.

Several significant aspects of udal law are not seen elsewhere in the UK:

#While in the rest of Britain ownership of land extends only to the high water mark (where the Crown is deemed to own what lies below it), in Orkney and Shetland it extends to the lowest astronomical tide. This caused complications during the development of the North Sea oilfields, for builders of pipelines needed permission from the foreshore owners in order to proceed with their work. Under the Land Registration etc. (Scotland) Act 2012, entry of title onto the Land Register of Scotland must include a cadastral plan, but the foreshore on such plans needs only to be drawn at the mean low water mark of ordinary spring tides. Where udal title exists, an appropriate note must be inserted on the plan to indicate that title extends to the lowest ebb.
#Swans, which are the property of the Crown elsewhere in the UK, are the property of the people in Orkney and Shetland.

==Modern land reform==
The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 extinguished any remaining obligations to pay skat (ignoring whatever vestigial or forgotten laws not in effect), effective 28 November 2004. In addition, the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 (as amended by the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003) provides that, as of 1 April 2003, first registration will be required on any transfer of an interest in udal tenure that had not previously been entered in the Land Register, as real rights can only be obtained by registration.

<text>Eduard Franz Joseph Graf von Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe (24 February 183329 November 1895) was an Austrian statesman, who served for two terms as Minister-President of Cisleithania, leading cabinets from 1868 to 1870 and 1879 to 1893. He was a scion of the Irish Taaffe noble dynasty, who held hereditary titles from two countries: Imperial Counts (&quot;Reichsgrafen&quot;) of the Holy Roman Empire and viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland (in the United Kingdom).

==Family background and early years==

Taaffe was the second son of Count Louis Taaffe, 9th Viscount Taaffe (1791–1855), Austrian Minister of Justice during the Revolutions of 1848 and president of the court of appeal, and his wife, Princess Amalie von Bretzenheim (1802-1874), granddaughter of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. His ancestor Francis Taaffe, 3rd Earl of Carlingford (1639–1704) had entered the service of the Habsburg monarchy in the 17th century; the family held large estates in Bohemia.

As a child, Eduard Taaffe was one of the chosen companions of the young Archduke Francis Joseph, who in 1848 was crowned Emperor of Austria. That connection led to a distinguished political career for Taaffe in the service of the Habsburgs. He studied law at the University of Vienna and entered public service in 1852. From 1861 he served at the Bohemian crown land government in Prague and in 1863 was appointed &quot;Landespräsident&quot; (stadtholder) in the Duchy of Salzburg. He backed the implementation of the February Patent constitution under State Minister Anton von Schmerling and in 1864 became a member of the Bohemian Diet (&quot;zemský sněm&quot;, &quot;Landtag&quot;), where he did however not excel. In 1867 the Chairmen of the Ministers&#x27; Conference Count Richard Belcredi appointed him Upper Austrian stadtholder at Linz.

By the death of his elder brother Charles (1823–1873), colonel in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Eduard Graf von Taaffe succeeded to the Irish titles. He had married Countess Irma Csáky in 1862, by whom he left four daughters and one son, Henry.

== Political life ==

===Minister-President (first term)===
During the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Emperor Francis Joseph offered him the post of Minister of the Interior in Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust&#x27;s cabinet. In June he became vice-president of the ministry, and at the end of the year, he entered the first ministry (&quot;Bürgerministerium&quot;) of the newly organized Austrian portion of the monarchy. For the next three years, he took a notable part in the confused political changes, and probably more than any other politician represented the wishes of the emperor.

Taaffe had entered the ministry as a German Liberal, but he soon took an intermediate position between the Liberal majority of the &quot;Bürgerministerium&quot; (&quot;Citizen&#x27;s Ministry&quot; because it was mainly commoners) and the party which desired a federal constitution and which was strongly supported at court. From September 1868 to January 1870, after the retirement of Auersperg, he was president of the cabinet. In 1870, the government fell on the question of the revision of the constitution: Taaffe with Potocki and Johann Nepomuk Berger wished to make some concessions to the Federalists; the Liberal majority wished to preserve undiminished the authority of the Imperial Council. The two parties presented memoranda to the emperor, each defending their view and offering their resignation: after some hesitation, the emperor accepted the policy of the majority, and Taaffe and his friends resigned.
=== Second term ===

The Liberals, however, failed to form a new government, as the representatives of most of the territories refused to appear in the Imperial Council: they resigned, and in the month of April Potocki and Taaffe returned to office. The latter failed, however, in an attempt to come to an understanding with the Czechs, and in their turn, they had to make way for the Clerical and Federalist cabinet of Hohenwart. Taaffe now became governor of Tyrol, but in 1879, on the collapse of the Liberal government, he was recalled to high office. At first, he attempted to carry on the government without a change of principles, but he soon found it necessary to come to an understanding with the Feudal and Federal parties and was responsible for the conduct of the negotiations which, in the elections of the same year, gave a majority to the different groups of the National and Clerical opposition. In July he became minister president: at first, he still continued to govern with the Liberals, but this was soon made impossible, and he was obliged to turn for support to the Conservatives.

Legislation to help the working class emerged from Catholic conservatives. They turned to social reform by using Swiss and German models and intervening in state economic matters. In Germany, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had used such policies to neutralize socialist promises. The Catholics studied the Swiss Factory Act of 1877 which limited working hours for everyone, and gave maternity benefits, and German laws that insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace. These served as the basis for Austria&#x27;s 1885 Trade Code Amendment.

=== Election reform of 1882 ===

Count Taaffe is mostly remembered for his election reform of 1882, which reduced to 5 guilders the minimum tax base required for men over the age of 24 to vote. Before this reform, the tax base was set locally, but was usually at a considerably higher level, so that only 6% of the male population of Cisleithania had been entitled to vote. However, even after this reform, there were still four classes of voters whose vote counted differently, depending on how much tax an individual was paying.

The next election reform was enacted in 1896 by Kasimir Felix Graf Badeni, who succeeded in bringing about more radical reforms than Taaffe had achieved by creating a fifth class which &quot;included all males who had attained the age of twenty four years&quot;.

=== Policies on nationalities ===
It was Taaffe&#x27;s great achievement that he persuaded the Czechs to abandon the policy of abstention and to take part in the parliament. It was on the support of them, the Poles, and the Clericals that his majority depended. His avowed intention was to unite the nationalities of Austria: Germans and Slavs were, as he said, equally integral parts of Austria; neither must be oppressed; both must unite to form an Austrian parliament. Notwithstanding the growing opposition of the German Liberals, who refused to accept the equality of the nationalities, he kept his position for thirteen years.

== Late years ==
In 1893 he was defeated on a proposal for the revision of the franchise and resigned. He retired into private life, and died two years later at his country residence, Ellischau, in Bohemia.

<doc id="1295279" wikidata="Q1379631" url="?curid=1295279" title="Evalyn Walsh McLean">
<text>Evalyn McLean ( Walsh; August 1, 1886 – April 26, 1947) was an American mining heiress and socialite, famous for reputedly being an owner of the Hope Diamond (which was bought in 1911 for US$180,000 from Pierre Cartier), as well as another famous diamond, the Star of the East. She also authored a memoir, &quot;Father Struck It Rich&quot;, with Boyden Sparkes.

==Early life==
McLean was born on August 1, 1886, in Leadville, Colorado, the daughter of Carrie Bell Reed, a former schoolteacher, and Thomas Walsh, an Irish immigrant miner and prospector. She had one sibling, a brother, Vinson Walsh (1888–1905), who died in a car accident in Newport, Rhode Island, at age 17. When she was 12 years old, her father discovered a gold mine and became a multimillionaire. The family moved to a large mansion on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C. At the age of 14, she moved to Paris for singing lessons. Instead, she lived a wild life, coloring her hair, adding rouge to her cheeks, and drinking alcohol.

==The Hope Diamond==
On January 28, 1911, in a deal made in the offices of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, McLean&#x27;s husband purchased the Hope Diamond for US$180,000 () from Pierre Cartier of Cartier Jewelers in New York. The Hope Diamond was traditionally associated with a curse, but no tragic events befell the couple until eight years later. Due to the rumors of a curse, her friends and mother-in-law urged her to sell it back, but Cartier refused to buy it.

==Personal life==
In 1908, Evalyn Walsh married Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Beale McLean, the son of John Roll McLean and heir to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; publishing fortune. They had four children, two of whom predeceased their parents:
* Vinson Walsh McLean (1909–1919), who died aged 9, after being hit by an automobile (The maternal uncle for whom he was named had died in a car accident at age 17.)
* John Randolph &quot;Jock&quot; McLean II married three times:
** Agnes Landon Pyne Davis Bacon (née Davis), in 1941
** Elizabeth Muhlenberg &quot;Betty&quot; Brooke Blake Phipps Reed (née Blake), in 1943
** former model Mildred W. &quot;Brownie&quot; Brown Schrafft née Brown (July 14, 1917 – January 9, 2019), in 1953. In 1976, &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine publisher Larry Flynt rented Brownie McLean&#x27;s Palm Beach estate, &quot;El Solano&quot;, and used it as a background for published photographs. In January 1980, she sold the mansion to Yoko Ono and John Lennon. Mildred turned down the Hope Diamond in 1952, when offered to her by her husband after his mother&#x27;s death, due to the alleged &quot;curse&quot; associated with it.
* Evalyn Washington &quot;Evie&quot; McLean (originally named Emily Beale McLean) (November 16, 1921–September 20, 1946), married United States Senator Robert Rice Reynolds (1884–1963), and was found dead by her mother less than five years later, at age 24. A coroner&#x27;s inquest determined the cause of death to be an accidental overdose of sleeping pills. 
** Evie&#x27;s daughter Mamie Spears Reynolds, was the first woman to qualify for the Daytona 500, and married Luigi &quot;Coco&quot; Chinetti Jr., the son of Italian race car driver and Ferrari agent Luigi Chinetti, in 1963; they divorced two years later. She later married Joseph E. Gregory, with whom she had two children.
* Edward Beale McLean Jr., married Ann Carroll Meem, in May 1938. Their divorce was granted in July 1943 and, in August, he married actress Gloria Hatrick, with whom he had two sons, Ronald and Michael. Ronald died, in 1969, from enemy fire, while serving in Vietnam as a first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. McLean and Hatrick divorced in January 1948 and, that October, McLean married Manuela Mercedes &quot;Mollie&quot; Hudson, who had been the first wife of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. and was a niece of racehorse owner Charles S. Howard. In August 1949, Gloria married actor James Stewart. McLean Jr. and Hudson-Vanderbilt separated in the 1960s, then divorced in 1973, after which he married a fourth time, to Patricia Dewey.
The McLean marriage ended with much publicized and bitterly contested divorce proceedings, initiated by Mrs. McLean on grounds of infidelity, in October 1931. Mr McLean filed for divorce in Mexico but McLean obtained a permanent injunction from a District of Columbia court ordering the cessation of the Mexican proceedings. Edward McLean then suddenly announced he had already married Rose Douras, a sister of Hollywood film star Marion Davies; though a marriage had not occurred. Mr McLean immediately took up residence in Riga, Latvia, where he again filed for a divorce, which was granted on December 13, 1932.

Edward McLean&#x27;s increasingly erratic behavior and reckless spending led to the forced sale of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; by trustees appointed by the court. The divorce proceedings of Evalyn McLean continued in United States court but were dropped following an October 31, 1933, verdict by a jury in a Maryland trial that declared Edward McLean to be legally insane and incapable of managing his affairs. The court ordered that he be committed indefinitely to a psychiatric hospital.

Edward McLean died of a heart attack at Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital in Towson, Maryland in 1941.

The site of the McLean home, Friendship — a sprawling country mansion built for her father-in-law by John Russell Pope and which was located on Tenleytown Road, N.W. — is now a condominium complex known as McLean Gardens. The original house was demolished in the 1940s though some of the property&#x27;s garden features remain intact, as does the Georgian-style ballroom. A later residence, also known as Friendship, is located at the corner of R Street, N.W. and Wisconsin Avenue, and remains a private home. Her childhood home, a grandiose Second Empire-style mansion at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., is now the Indonesian embassy.

McLean was a friend and confidante to Alice Roosevelt Longworth and Florence Harding, the wife of Warren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States. McLean and Harding frequented movie theaters and played bridge together and had a close relationship.

McLean and her husband made a highly publicised journey to Russia, shortly after the October Revolution, in an effort to get Ned&#x27;s uncle, George Bakhmeteff, reinstated as the Russian ambassador to the US. An American diplomat, William Bullitt, had to talk McLean out of flaunting the Hope Diamond on the streets of Moscow as a symbol of the superiority of capitalism.

She was a victim of Gaston Means, a former FBI agent, murder suspect, and grifter, who claimed he had set a deal to free the Lindbergh baby for a ransom of over US$100,000, which she advanced him. Means disappeared with the money, only to resurface months later in California, and ask McLean for additional funds. Suspicious of Means&#x27; activities, she helped lead police to him; he was also wanted for various other crimes and civil actions. That ultimately led to his conviction and imprisonment on larceny charges.

==Death and estate==
On April 26, 1947, at aged 60, McLean died of pneumonia, then was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington D.C., in the Walsh family tomb, alongside her daughter. The Reverend Edmund Walsh, S.J. vice president of Georgetown University read her funeral service, which was attended by family, and close friends including United States Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy.

Upon her death, the principal of her estate and her jewelry, including the Hope Diamond, were left to her seven grandchildren, to be managed by four trustees until the five oldest grandchildren passed their 25th birthdays. The trustees were:
# Frank Murphy, United States Supreme Court Justice
# Thurman Arnold, former Assistant Attorney General
# Msgr. Fulton J. Sheen, American bishop and later archbishop of the Catholic Church
# The Reverend Edmund Walsh, S.J. vice president of Georgetown University
Her sons, however, received the proceeds of the Walsh Trust, which was established by her father Thomas Walsh, who had died in 1910. She gave her son-in-law, the former United States Senator Robert Rice Reynolds, lifetime use of the McLean home, Friendship. If the home was sold by the Trustees, he was to receive the proceeds of the sale.

==In popular culture==
Her highly promoted trip to the Russian SFSR is mentioned in a Cole Porter song, &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, in the lines &quot;When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) / Can get Russian reds to &quot;yes&quot; her, / Then I suppose / Anything goes.&quot;

In the 1979 NBC television miniseries &quot;Backstairs at the White House&quot;, in the midst of a score-settling rant Florence Harding mentions to White House maid and hairdresser Maggie Rogers that on the traditional day that the outgoing First Lady shows the incoming one the executive mansion and how things work there, outgoing First Lady Edith Wilson effectively told her that it would not be acceptable to bring McLean along with her; no doubt in her mind because Mrs. Wilson looked down on them. Mrs. Harding had not forgiven Mrs. Wilson for the perceived slight and for that and other perceived ones, she was going to make a point of inviting McLean over to the White House.
