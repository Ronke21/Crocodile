<text>Walter Hines Page (August 15, 1855 – December 21, 1918) was an American journalist, publisher, and diplomat. He was the United States ambassador to Great Britain during World War I. After World War I broke out in 1914 Page was so enthusiastically in favor of Britain during the period of American neutrality (before April 1917) that Wilson and other top officials increasingly discounted his views. Page was instrumental in negotiating the sale of American war materials, including munitions, food and supplies, to the British, helping to ensure that it had the resources it needed to continue the fight against Germany.

Page made important contributions to the fields of journalism and literature. He founded the &quot;State Chronicle&quot;, a newspaper in Raleigh, North Carolina, and worked with other leaders to gain legislative approval for what is now known as North Carolina State University, which was established as a land-grant college in 1885. He worked on several newspapers, including the &quot;New York World&quot; and &quot;Evening Post&quot;, served as the editor of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; for a year between 1895 and 1896, and he also played a major role in establishing Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, a prominent publishing house that produced the works of numerous well-known authors such as Rudyard Kipling. In addition Page was a literary critic who actively promoted the works of Southern writers, and he played a crucial part in shaping the development of Southern literature.

==Life and career==
Page was born in Cary, North Carolina to father Allison Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Page and his wife, Catherine Frances Raboteau. His father built the Page-Walker Hotel about 1868. Walter started undergraduate studies at Trinity College (now Duke University), completed his bachelor&#x27;s at Randolph-Macon College, and started a master&#x27;s at Johns Hopkins University. His studies complete, he taught for a time in Louisville, Kentucky.

On November 15, 1880, Page married Willa Alice Wilson. They had a daughter and three sons including Arthur W. Page. His cousin was Logan Waller Page.

Page began his journalism career as a writer and then editor at the St. Joseph &quot;Gazette&quot; in Missouri. (The St. Joseph &quot;Gazette&quot; published in that town from 1845 until June 30, 1988, when its morning position was taken over by its sister paper, the St. Joseph &quot;News-Press.&quot;) After a short time at the &quot;Gazette&quot;, in 1881 Page resigned to travel through the South, having arranged to contribute letters on southern sociological conditions to the &quot;New York World&quot;, the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; of Massachusetts, and the &quot;Boston Post&quot;. He intended these letters to educate both the North and the South in a fuller understanding of their mutual dependence. In 1882, he joined the editorial staff of the New York &quot;World;&quot; among his major work was a series of articles on Mormonism, the result of personal investigation in Utah.

Later in 1882, Page went to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he founded the &quot;State Chronicle&quot;. Two years later, he was a founding member of the Watauga Club, along with Arthur Winslow and William Joseph Peele. Together, they petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly early in 1885 to create an institution for industrial education for &quot;wood-work, mining, metallurgy, practical agriculture&quot; and similar fields; establishing what is now North Carolina State University, a land-grant college, which could receive federal funds.

Page returned to New York in 1883 and for four years was on the staff of the &quot;Evening Post&quot;. From 1887 to 1895, he was manager and, after 1890, editor of &quot;The Forum&quot;, a monthly magazine. From 1895 to 1900, he was literary adviser to Houghton, Mifflin and Company, and for most of the same period editor of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; (1896–99).

From 1900 to 1913, Page was partner and vice president of Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.; when he joined Frank Nelson Doubleday as a partner, the company&#x27;s name was changed to include his. He also was editor of &quot;World&#x27;s Work&quot; magazine. Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. became one of the great book publishing companies of the 20th century. The company sometimes published under the name &quot;Country Life Press&quot; in Garden City, New York, where Page resided in the years prior to World War I. Among the great writers it published in its early years was Rudyard Kipling. In 1986, it was acquired by Bertelsmann AG.

Page believed that a free and open education was fundamental to democracy. In 1902, he published &quot;The Rebuilding of Old Commonwealths,&quot; which emphasized that. He felt that nothing (class, economic means, race, or religion) should be a barrier to education.

== Ambassador ==

In March 1913, Page was appointed United States ambassador to Great Britain by President Woodrow Wilson. In August 1915, Page&#x27;s daughter, Katharine, wed Boston-based architect Charles Greely Loring in a ceremony at St James&#x27;s Palace in London.

Page was one of the key figures involved in bringing the United States into World War I on the Allied side. A proud Southerner, he admired his British roots and believed that the British were fighting a war for democracy. As ambassador, he defended British policies to Wilson and helped to shape a pro-Allied slant in the President and in the United States as a whole.

Page was criticized for his unabashedly pro-British stance by those who thought his priority should be defending American interests in the face of British rough handling of American shipping. He and his staff had to deal with the British claim of the right to stop and search American ships, including the examination of mail pouches; the commercial blockade (1915); and the &quot;blacklist,&quot; the names of American firms with whom the British forbade all financial and commercial dealings by their citizens (1916).

In the fall of 1918, Page became seriously ill, forcing him to resign his post as Ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s. He returned to his home in Pinehurst, North Carolina, where he died shortly thereafter. He is buried in Old Bethesda Cemetery in Aberdeen, North Carolina.

In the years after his death, Page was viewed as somewhat of a villain in the eyes of many revisionist American historians. Examining the decision-making processes which had led the United States to enter into the First World War, many American revisionists in the 1920s depicted Page as a traitor to his country - a modern day Benedict Arnold who used his position of trust in American service to secretly aid the machinations of the British government. 

During an era in which a significant portion of the American public had come to regard the United States&#x27; entry into the European conflict as a grave mistake, Page&#x27;s pro-British inclinations, and his supposedly high degree of influence over President Wilson&#x27;s thinking, exposed the ambassador to charges that he had manipulated the president into intervening on behalf of the British in 1917. Subsequent historical research has shown that Page had far less influence over Wilson&#x27;s thinking than was previously suggested and he is no longer believed to have played a central role in the president&#x27;s decision to go to war.

<text>The Nepal national football team () represents Nepal in International men&#x27;s football, and is governed by the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA). A member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the Nepali football team plays their home games at Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu.

== History ==

=== Origins (1921–1993) ===
Football in Nepal had been a national sport as early as 1921 during the Rana dynasty. Several clubs were formed and several domestic tournaments such as the Ram Janaki Cup (1934), and the Tribhuvan Challenge Shield (1948) were organized. In 1951, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) was founded, and this saw the formation of the Nepal national football team.

=== Emergence (1963–1970) ===
In 1963, Nepal appeared in their first international away game in the Aga Khan Gold Cup; the predecessor of the President&#x27;s Gold Cup, Asia Champion Club Tournament, and Asian Club Championship (now rebranded as the AFC Champions League) after various associations (including ANFA) insisted on entering national teams instead of clubs. After Nepal entered an 18-man squad, ANFA flew the players to Dhaka, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to play their first match. Nepal faced &quot;Western Railway&quot;, a Pakistani team in the Bangabandhu National Stadium. However, Nepal lost the match 0–7. Two days later, Nepal played the Dhaka Wanderers, a local East Pakistani team. This match was also lost 0–7. After two disastrous games, Nepal was sure to be knocked out of the preliminary round. The final game was against Dhaka Police Club, though, despite the previous heavy losses, Nepal managed to win the game with a single goal, Prakash Bikram Shah becoming the first Nepali to score on foreign soil. The goal was scored in the 19th minute.

=== Modernization &amp; golden generation (1970–1999) ===
In 1970, Nepal became a member of FIFA. Two years later, Nepal joined the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). With this, Nepal played their first international match on 13 October 1972, where they lost 2–6 to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The first Nepali footballer to score the first international goal for Nepal in a FIFA-recognized tournament was Y.B Ghale. Ghale scored against Kuwait in the 1982 Asian Games. Despite the popularity of the game, the lack of appropriate footballing infrastructure and the dearth of trainers, technicians, and other facilities have always been obstacles in the way of the Nepali FA&#x27;s endeavors to raise the standard of football among the players of a nation that has an official per capita income of just 1,196 US dollars. The woes of Nepali football, however, have been immensely relieved by FIFA&#x27;s determination to promote football in Nepal through youth programs.
In the mid-1980s, FIFA provided financial assistance and sent a number of coaches to help Nepal&#x27;s federation to launch its first youth program, which was geared towards spotting talent at the grassroots level (such as in schools, for example) and providing young players with the necessary know-how, both on and off the pitch. The initial five-year plan helped half the players groomed under the first youth program to find a place in the national side, and the team that won the 2 gold medals in the first and sixth South Asian Federation (SAF) Games mostly consisted of the players from that youth program. Despite Nepal being considered among the lower-ranked nations, Nepal has been largely successful in the South Asian Games where they won two gold, two silver, and two bronze medals.

Nepal hosted several notable friendlies from teams outside the Asian Confederation during the mid to late 80s, against Denmark in 1986; USSR and East Germany in 1987; and West Germany in 1989. While at the same time, Nepal still entered tournaments against club sides such as FC Ural Sverdlovsk Oblast in the 1989 ANFA Cup.

Nepal continued on with their winning ways through several minor tournaments which saw the nation showered with titles including the 1997 and 1998 Governor&#x27;s Gold Cup, winning gold at the 1993 South Asian Games, and reaching 3rd place in the 1993 South Asian Association of Regional Co-operation Gold Cup (the first edition of the SAFF Championship).

=== Decline (2000–2009) ===
The Nepali football came across a forgettable two years from 2001 to 2003 when the row between two factions (government-backed and FIFA-backed) led Nepali football into deep trouble. Nepal faced a ban and therefore could not participate in any events and the rankings slipped heavily. The dispute was settled, but not before it contributed to pushing Nepali football backward. Nepal celebrated their 100th international football match in January 2003 when they played Bangladesh in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship. Nepal failed to make any real impact at the tournament. During its 22 years of international participation, the Nepali team has only played 26 nations outside of South Asia, but it has defeated all of the country&#x27;s South Asian neighbors during various regional tournaments. Nepal also faced non-AFC teams in competitive tournaments such as Ghana U23 in the 1999 Bangabandhu Cup, and Kazakhstan in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign (although Kazakhstan was a member of the AFC during this match).

In 2002, Nepal also faced a 7 match football series against Afghanistan and Afghanistan defeated Nepal 7-0 in that series.

Despite many attempts to raise the standard of football, the players of the resource-strapped nation have not been able to make their mark in international football beyond South Asia. In 2003 during the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, Nepal&#x27;s A national team suffered a number of heavy defeats in international matches outside of South Asia. In a match during the Asian Cup qualifying round in South Korea, the hosts scored 16 goals to no reply. In their six matches, Nepal conceded 45 goals and failed to hit the back of the net even once. However, the qualifying competition for the 2002 FIFA World Cup witnessed one of Nepal&#x27;s best performances in international football, with the &quot;Gorkhalis&quot; securing two wins in four matches and scoring 13 goals in two matches against Macao and Iraq. But with the Nepali national and youth teams failing to achieve any noticeable success at the international level and FIFA introducing new age restriction systems in several international tournaments, Nepal recently decided to compete only in the FIFA World Cup and AFC Asian Cup qualifiers as well as the SAFF Championship until 2006.

=== Resurgence (2010–present) ===

After the marquee appointments of Graham Roberts, Nepal had experienced a fair amount of success following the decade of decline. Nepal won Saff U-19 championship in 2015 and 3 major tournaments in 2016, the Bangabandhu Cup and the AFC Solidarity Cup and won a gold medal in 2016 South Asian Games. Nepal lost no match in 2016.

Nepal managed a good performance in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification, even though the team was chosen as a replacement for the Guam national football team as Guam chose not to participate. Nepal had two successful draws against much stronger Philippines and Yemen at home, both ended 0–0. However, as the team lost to Tajikistan twice and away loss to the Philippines and Yemen, the Nepalis failed to qualify to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup.

Nepal participated in the second round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification where they have to face strong Australia, Kuwait and Jordan, alongside minnows Chinese Taipei. The Nepalis only managed one single win over Chinese Taipei away 2–0 and lost to the other opponents without scoring a goal after five matches.

Nepal participated in the 2021 SAFF Championship and managed to reach the tournament final where they were defeated 0–3 by India. 

In October 2023, Nepal participated in the first round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification against Laos. The first leg contested in a goalless draw between both team where else on 17 October 2023, Manish Dangi scored the only goal in the match to secure the victory for Nepal seeing them advanced to the second round.

In March 2024, Nepal lost to Bahrain 0–3 in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification match which eliminated the team from advancing to the next round.

===Home stadium===
The team&#x27;s home ground is various around the nation one of the ground being Dasarath Rangasala Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium in Kathmandu, Nepal. Holding 15,000 spectators all of which are beautifully seated. It is the biggest stadium in Nepal. It is named after Dashrath Chand, one of the martyrs of Nepal.

Most recently, the stadium was used as a primary venue for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup and the 2013 SAFF Championship, with the Halchowk Stadium hosting some of the matches as well.

Apart from sporting events, the stadium is also used as a music venue for cultural events with Bryan Adams being the most notable act that performed at the site.

Before the 2013 SAFF Championship in Nepal, the stadium underwent a heavy renovation that saw several improvements such as the expansion of seats from 20,000 to 28,000.

The country also has some recently added stadiums that include Pokhara football stadium located at Pokhara Rangasala which has recently been constructed in 2021.

=== Kit evolution ===

The national team&#x27;s kit employs a tricolor of red, blue, and white to reflect the colors of the national flag of Nepal. With red being used for home matches, and blue for away. The pattern in some kits reflects the triangular shaping of the flag, namely the 2013 kit. Nepal&#x27;s kits are mostly template kits, as opposed to a custom team-specific kit. This is because the Nepal national team isn&#x27;t lucrative enough to afford kit partnership deals with manufacturers.

Very little is known about the history prior to 1998. However, during the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, the Nepali national team hired Bijay Shah to provide technical assistance to the squad, while also acting as the assistant coach. At the time, the team didn&#x27;t have printed sportswear for the tournament. After printing makeshift kits, Bijay was inspired to start a T-shirt printing company known as , where through the partnership with a US printing company, and colleagues in South Korea, they produced their first batch of kits for the national team prior to the 1999 South Asian Games.

On 4 March 2019, ANFA has revealed two new jerseys for members of the national football team along with new national football anthem. The new jerseys have ANFA logo on the left where used to be national flag in the old jerseys. There is also national flag and picture of Mount Everest above the ANFA logo. This new sign is designed by Sandeep Tiwari. ANFA also made provision of white jerseys for friendly matches.

In 2021, ANFA ended the contract with Kelme, the previous kit sponsor, and signed with KTM CTY.

=== Nepal Red &amp; Blue ===

During the ANFA Cup, the All Nepal Football Association occasionally entered two teams for Nepal; Nepal Red &amp; Nepal Blue. This is very much akin to other South Asian teams such as Pakistan B and Bangladesh B. Nepal Red was a selection of Nepali players that played as the full Nepal national football team. Whereas, Nepal Blue was effectively the B-team.

Most of the Nepali top players play in the Nepal Red team, and it is also described as &quot;the Nepal senior team&quot;, and is captained by the regular national team captain. While Nepal Blue is described as the &quot;second string team&quot;.

<text>Phönix-Schwingen (Phoenix&#x27;s Wings) op. 125 is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in 1853. Strauss has amalgamated his late father&#x27;s orchestra with his own in 1849 and with the new responsibility, was expected to rehearse, organise, compose, orchestrate, and lastly, conduct at two or three venues on the same day. During the hectic years of 1851 and 1852, Strauss exerted himself and after a tiring tour of Germany late 1852, he was taken seriously ill.

Many of his engagements were forced to be cancelled although Strauss felt sufficiently well to appear at his benefit concert at the Sofienbad-Saal ballroom on January 16, 1853 along with his new waltz &#x27;Phönix-Schwingen&#x27;. The title suggested a possible reference to himself, having like the mythical bird, &#x27;risen from the ashes&#x27;. However, Strauss&#x27; interesting title may well refer to the unpopular Vienna transport enterprise &#x27;Phoenix&#x27; which had promised faster and cheaper travel intending to rival the traditional Viennese &#x27;fiaker&#x27;. The enterprise proved to be no more than a flash in the pan and foundered after a mere few days.

Whether meaning the mythical creature or the enterprise, Strauss&#x27; work is very brisk and stylish, with rising arpeggios and effective motif usage. The work was dedicated to Hans Guido von Bülow.

<doc id="1278000" wikidata="Q16197105" url="?curid=1278000" title="Ivan Massow">
<text>Ivan Julian Massow (born 11 September 1967) is a British financial services entrepreneur, gay rights campaigner, and media personality. He is also a former chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. He has been active in UK politics, formerly as a member of the Conservative Party and since 2016 in the Liberal Democrats.

He is Master of the Southdown and Eridge Hunt.

==Early life==
Massow was born Ivan Field in Brighton, East Sussex. His relationships with his father and subsequently his stepfather were poor; as a boy he ended up being cared for by social services, before being adopted as a pre-teenager by John Massow. Commenting on his life prior to his adoption, Massow has stated that &quot;My life up to then is a bit of a blur. I had four different families, my name changed from Field to Mitchell to Massow, I was moved around for various reasons.&quot;

Massow is dyslexic and left school at 16 with one O-level in metalwork, with possibly others in photography and history; however, information regarding his early qualifications is ambiguous, and Massow himself has commented that &quot;I lied about them so much, I can&#x27;t remember what&#x27;s actually true.&quot; He studied at Eastbourne for a BTEC in art and design, then moved to Bristol and was employed by an insurance firm. In 1990 Massow moved to London and started his own financial services business.

==Business career==

===Massow Financial Services===
In 1990 and with less than £5,000 Massow started Bowater Massow, later to become Massow Financial Services Ltd, running it initially from a squat in Kentish Town, London, using just a mobile phone. Massow specialised in offering financial services to gay people, in particular sourcing competitively priced insurance and mortgages for customers whose sexuality previously resulted in their being charged much higher premiums.

Massow&#x27;s company soon attracted customers and expanded; the success and high profile of the business resulted in Massow being voted Man of the Year by the &quot;Pink Paper&quot; in 1996, and by 1997 Massow had become a multi-millionaire. At the end of the decade his company had several offices, including branches in Edinburgh, Manchester and Liverpool, and was at the forefront of the &#x27;gay finance&#x27; sector.

At the end of 2000 Massow merged his company with another gay-orientated finance company, Rainbow Finance of Oxford, thereby creating Rainbow Massow, one of the largest independent financial advice firms in the UK. Massow took the role of chairman while Louis Letourneau, who had run Rainbow Finance, became managing director. The market value of the new company was £20 million, and Massow predicted that turnover would rise from £2 million per annum to over £3.5 million. However, within one year the firm ran out of money and was placed in receivership. Both Massow and Letourneau blamed each other for the firm&#x27;s demise. Massow bought the company back from the receiver for about £1.5 million and subsequently re-established it.

===Jake===

In 2001 Massow set up Jake, an online social networking site for gay professionals.

===Allied Dunbar and Zurich===
Between 2003 and 2004 Massow was director of another financial adviser firm, this time a tied agent of the Zurich Advice Network (previously Allied Dunbar). Massow had previously campaigned against what he saw as Allied Dunbar&#x27;s anti-gay underwriting practices, but he claimed that &quot;they&#x27;ve moved on and, for the sake of my customers, so must I [...] if other gay financial advisers think they&#x27;re doing the best for their customers by blackballing all the companies that were once out of line (there were about eight of them) when it came to gay issues – then their priorities are very strange. Financial advice is about getting the best product – not petty grudge bearing.&quot; Massow accepted a transitional loan of £330,000 to enable office relocation and staff training. However the arrangement was short-lived and ironically ended after a dispute between Massow and Zurich over Zurich&#x27;s approach to insuring the gay clients in which the firm specialised. A long £13 million legal case followed which was settled out of court.

===Pay Me My===
In September 2011 Massow set up &quot;Pay Me My&quot;, a trading name of Massows Limited, which offered customers a rebate of 80% of the &#x27;trail&#x27; commission paid to their existing advisers if the customer switched their insurance, pension and investment policies to the agency of Pay Me My, who would take 20% as their fee. Massow defended the business model of the firm from suggestions that it would not be viable following changes to financial regulation in the UK due to start on 1 January 2013; however, it ceased trading in August 2013 when the government banned commission rendering its services obsolete. The firm informed its clients that, should they choose to remain with the company, all future trail commissions would be retained and not rebated. This action was unpopular with customers, therefore Massow agreed to sell the remaining assets under management to Clubfinance, who would continue rebating the majority of their commission.

===Others===
Other Massow businesses include &quot;Halos and Horns&quot; and &quot;Massows Angels&quot;.

==Contemporary art==
In 1999, Massow became Chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. He was brought in by Director Philip Dodd to increase sponsorship and patronage for the organisation. Dodd claimed that Massow was a &quot;mass of contradictions, just like the ICA. He&#x27;s a risky choice for us, but the ICA should always live dangerously.&quot; However the working relationship between Massow and Dodd subsequently proved to be not wholly successful, as Dodd increasingly disliked Massow&#x27;s knack for self-promotion and perceived him to be taking over the role of being the organisation&#x27;s public face.

The situation deteriorated irreparably when in January 2002 Massow wrote an article in &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine, attacking the predominance of conceptual art in the art world. He described modern concept art as &quot;pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat&quot; and &quot;the product of over-indulged, middle-class [...], bloated egos who patronise real people with fake understanding&quot;. He called the ICA a &quot;pillar of the shock establishment&quot;. He attacked Tracey Emin saying she &quot;couldn&#x27;t think her way out of a paper bag&quot;, though he admitted this comment was &quot;a little below the belt&quot;.

In February 2002, Massow resigned as Chairman of the ICA, after the board unanimously requested him to. Board member Ekow Eshun was quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as saying &quot;I have no problem with Ivan bringing up this debate. But Ivan has been ramping up the story all week. I think he&#x27;s been a little bit of a pillock.&quot; There was speculation that Massow had deliberately been as provocative as possible to engineer his own sacking. Massow claims he spoke out to redress the imbalance between the promotion of conceptual and more traditional art in the British art scene.

His views have engendered strong feelings about him amongst the art world; a year after his resignation one artist commented that &quot;they treat him like the Black Death round here&quot;, although Massow has received less vocal support from many artists who fear they will never achieve recognition unless they follow the conceptual route.

Massow collects figurative contemporary art and claims that he visits art colleges and artists&#x27; studios regularly. In a 2003 interview he stated that &quot;I visit at least one a week, quietly, on my own. It helps to see how people work. How they define themselves. I rarely buy from galleries.&quot; Massow has had his portrait painted nearly 30 times, including a double nude diptych by Jonathan Yeo, son of Conservative MP Tim Yeo, and a portrait by Darren Coffield of Massow in full foxhunting attire, which was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery. Massow has personally provided regular financial support for some artists, to assist them in their lives and work.

==Politics==
Massow was first attracted to the politics of the Conservative Party when he was a boy. He joined his local Young Conservatives and at age 14 became its chairman, the youngest in the country at the time.

In the 1990s Massow&#x27;s flatmates were for a time former Conservative Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove, and MP and former head of Conservative policy Nicholas Boles, a situation Massow described as &quot;Tory Friends&quot;.

However Massow, along with many espousing &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot;, was frustrated by the Party&#x27;s apparent reluctance to alter its stance on gay rights issues and discrimination in general. In 2000, following John Bercow MP&#x27;s resignation from the front bench and the defection of Shaun Woodward MP to Labour, Massow too left the Conservative Party to join the Labour Party, where he was welcomed by Mo Mowlam. However Massow later returned to the Conservatives, subsequently claiming that the brief defection to Labour had a particular motivation: &quot;I knew if I switched it would be front page news. I thought it would help the party focus on repealing Section 28. I had one meeting with Labour, that&#x27;s all. I never wanted to be a candidate.&quot;

Massow is pro-hunting and in 2003 was depicted in full hunting gear in a portrait by Darren Coffield, exhibited at the National Portrait gallery.

Massow became head of the Conservative Technology Initiative for London in 2012.

In November 2014, he became the first Conservative to declare their plan to seek the Conservative Party&#x27;s candidacy to become Mayor of London at the 2016 elections. He was unsuccessful in his candidacy.

He joined the Liberal Democrats in September 2016, in protest at the Conservative Party&#x27;s post-Brexit vote stance.

==Media==
In November 2005, Massow was the winning mentor on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Make Me a Million&quot;.

Massow produced the film &quot;Banksy&#x27;s Coming For Dinner&quot;, starring Joan Collins.

In 2013 Massow was a significant part of Derren Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Great Art Robbery&quot; for Channel 4, in which Brown taught a group of old age pensioners how to get away with a robbery using various techniques such as how to stay unnoticed as well as controlling fear and nerves. The OAPs then embarked on a large-scale robbery, which involved stealing an expensive painting from Massow. The show first aired on 13 December 2013.

In 2016 Massow featured in the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Rich Brother, Poor Brother&quot; along with his estranged younger brother David. The documentary contrasted Ivan&#x27;s millionaire London lifestyle with that of David, a bohemian labourer who lives in a converted truck near Glastonbury.

==Charity work==
Massow Financial Services was the first mainstream business to sponsor London&#x27;s Gay Pride in 1990 which it continued to do in subsequent years.

Massow has raised funds for charity and founded the April Bombing Appeal for victims of the April 1999 nail-bombings in Soho, Brixton and Brick Lane in London. Massow Financial Services collected donations for the appeal.

In March 2010, in partnership with Oxfam and Beat That Quote, Massow developed &quot;Compare for Good&quot;, a charity fundraising price comparison website which promised to pay more than two-thirds of the money raised by the site to Oxfam. In March 2011 Beat That Quote was sold to Google.

==Personal life==
Massow is gay. He lives in Hoxton, in London&#x27;s East End and enjoys horse riding and foxhunting.

In the aftermath of the Zurich case, Massow moved to Spain. He began to drink heavily and became an alcoholic. However he has not drunk since 2008 and chaired an Alcoholics Anonymous group in Soho.

In 2010 Massow developed an aneurysm and became seriously ill. He required urgent hospital treatment, including at one point having to be operated on without anaesthetic, which saved his life. Massow subsequently described the experience as uplifting, stating that &quot;The prospect of dying wasn&#x27;t frightening, as I&#x27;d thought, but calm and full of relief. And instead of thinking about a tomorrow that wouldn&#x27;t come, I looked over my past &#x27;life&#x27; and was actually quite proud and happy I&#x27;d acquitted myself OK. There was nothing to be ashamed of.&quot;

<text>Rains Brook is a tributary of the River Leam.

Formed by a series of small headwater streams midway between Barby and Kilsby in Northamptonshire, it then flows west in a valley south of Rugby on the border between Northamptonshire and Warwickshire. It then runs south-west to where it joins the River Leam, between Kites Hardwick and Woolscott.

<doc id="1278013" wikidata="Q2539645" url="?curid=1278013" title="Elections in Mozambique">
<text>Mozambique elects representatives at several levels:
* at national level a head of state – the president – and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The Assembly of the Republic (&quot;Assembleia da República&quot;) has 250 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation.
* at provincial level, since 2009 Provincial Assemblies, elected at the same time that the national elections.
* at local level, since 1998 Municipal Elections to elect the leaders of the growing number of municipalities: the President of the Municipal Council and Municipal Assemblies.

==Electoral commission law==
Mozambican elections are run by a National Election Commission (CNE), and the election law has changed often. In December 2012, a new law in regards to the composition of the election commission consists of eight political party representatives: five appointed by the incumbent FRELIMO, two appointed by the principal opposition RENAMO and one by the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM). There are further three members nominated by civil society representatives, a judge appointed by the Higher Council of the Judicial Magistrature and an attorney appointed by the Higher Council of the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office.

==1994 – Presidential and Parliamentary election==

In the first multi-party elections held in Mozambique, in 1994, FRELIMO candidate and president of Mozambique since 1986 Joaquim Chissano was elected and the opposition party and former guerrilla group RENAMO acknowledged the result. The United Nations Security Council, which had a peacekeeping operation based there due to the civil war, endorsed the results as free and fair in Resolution 960.

==1999 – Presidential and Parliamentary election==

In the elections in late 1999 President Joaquim Chissano from FRELIMO was re-elected with 52.3% of the vote, and FRELIMO secured 133 of 250 parliamentary seats. The main opposition parties candidate, RENAMO&#x27;s Afonso Dhlakama, got 47.7% and the party won the remaining 117 parliamentary seats.

==2004 – Presidential and Parliamentary election==

In the 1–2 December 2004 election Armando Guebuza, the new FRELIMO candidate, won with 63.7% of the votes, more than twice as many as RENAMO&#x27;s candidate Afonso Dhlakama (31.7%).
In the parliamentary election FRELIMO won 62% (1.8 million) of the votes, RENAMO 29.7% (905,000 votes), and 18 minor parties shared the remaining 8%. FRELIMO will hold 160 of the parliamentary seats, RENAMO 90.

The elections have been criticized for not having been conducted in a fair and transparent manner by the National Electoral Commission. Several cases of electoral fraud have occurred and remained unsanctioned. This has been criticized among others by the European Union Election Observation Mission to Mozambique and the Carter Center. However, the elections shortcomings have probably not (also according to EU observers) affected the result in the presidential election. The distribution of parliamentary seats among the parties will have been somewhat altered, though (RENAMO probably losing a number of seats to FRELIMO).

On 2 February 2005 Guebuza was sworn in as president of the republic, but without Dhlakama and RENAMO&#x27;s recognition and presence at the inauguration. RENAMO have, however, agreed to participate in the Parliament and the Council of State.

==2009 – Presidential and Parliamentary election==

The Presidential and Parliamentary elections were held on 28 October 2009 for the fourth time since the introduction of the multiparty system. In the elections for the Assembly of the Republic, FRELIMO and RENAMO contested all 13 parliamentary constituencies, but the newly formed MDM was able to contest only 4 parliamentary constituencies.

==2014 – Presidential and Parliamentary election==

The Presidential and Parliamentary elections were held on 15 October 2014 for the fifth time since the introduction of the multiparty system. In the elections for the Assembly of the Republic, FRELIMO, MDM and RENAMO contested all 13 parliamentary constituencies.

<doc id="1278020" wikidata="Q294411" url="?curid=1278020" title="Olli Rehn">
<text>Olli Ilmari Rehn (; born 31 March 1962) is a Finnish public official who has been serving as governor of the Bank of Finland since 2018. A member of the Centre Party, he previously served as the European Commissioner for Enlargement from 2004 to 2010, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro from 2010 to 2014, and Minister of Economic Affairs in Juha Sipilä&#x27;s cabinet from 2015 until 2016. Rehn ran for President of Finland as an independent candidate in 2024, but was not elected.

==Early life and education==
Born in Mikkeli in Eastern Finland, Rehn studied economics, international relations, and journalism at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in the United States. He gained a master&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of Helsinki in 1989, and a D.Phil. from St. Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1996 on the subject of &quot;Corporatism and Industrial Competitiveness in Small European States&quot;. In addition to his native Finnish, he speaks English, German, French, Swedish, and some Russian, Polish and Hungarian.

Rehn also played football for his hometown club Mikkelin Palloilijat in Finland&#x27;s top division &quot;Mestaruussarja&quot; (now Veikkausliiga) in his youth.

==Finnish politics==
He began his political career in youth politics as a regular member of the Finnish Centre Youth and soon became the secretary general of the Nordic Centre Youth. In 1987, he was elected as the president of the Finnish Centre Youth. That position can be seen as predicting high political responsibilities in Finnish politics.

In 1988 Rehn was elected as a city councillor in Helsinki. He was vice president of the Centre Party from 1988 to 1994, having been president of its youth wing from 1987. Elected to the Finnish Parliament in 1991, Rehn led the Finnish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and was a special adviser to the Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho from 1992 to 1993. He left the Finnish Parliament in 1995 to become an MEP, aligned to the liberal group. He was, however, not re-elected in the 1996 election.

He was briefly the chairman of Veikkausliiga from 1996 to 1997. From 1998 to 2002 Rehn ran the office of Erkki Liikanen, Finland&#x27;s representative on the Prodi Commission. Rehn would later succeed Liikanen in the role of commissioner for Enterprise and Information Society. In 2002, he left European politics for the University of Helsinki, where he led the Centre for European Studies. In 2003, he became an adviser to the prime minister on economic policy, a position he held until his appointment to the European Commission the following year.

==European Commission==

Rehn served briefly on the Prodi Commission. He was appointed European commissioner for enterprise and information society on 12 July 2004, taking over the role from the previous Finnish commissioner Erkki Liikanen, who left his post the same day to become governor of the Bank of Finland. The Finnish government nominated Rehn for the incoming Barroso Commission, which took office on 22 November 2004. He was the youngest member of the first Barroso Commission.

Rehn&#x27;s appointment to the enlargement post was seen as a slight disappointment for Finland, who had hoped for their nominee to be given a portfolio relating to economic issues. Enlargement was a central issue for the EU in the run-up to the landmark accession of ten countries on 1 May 2004, but has since declined in importance, if only slightly. Rehn presided over the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, as well as continuing negotiations with Croatia and opening them with Turkey, the latter being perhaps the most significant and the most hotly debated future accession.

Rehn favours Turkish membership but has controversially suggested permanent restrictions on the free movement of workers from Turkey, &quot;in case serious disturbances occur in the labour market within the EU as a result of Turkey’s accession&quot;, an attitude seen by some as running counter to the whole purpose and spirit of the EU. He has stressed the importance of greater respect for human rights and civil liberties as preconditions for Turkey&#x27;s entry, while acknowledging the advances it had already made in this respect.

Siim Kallas was twice acting commissioner in his stead, from 19 April 2014 to 25 May 2014 while he was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 elections to the European Parliament and from 1 July 2014 – 16 July 2014 after he took up his seat.

===Selection hearing===
Questioned by the European Parliament, Rehn offered his thoughts on the prospects for accession of each of the countries highest on the enlargement agenda. He praised Turkey for the human rights advances it had made but said he would advocate stronger monitoring if the decision was taken to open accession talks by the European Council when it considered the question in December.

Asked about free movement of Turkish labour after the country&#x27;s accession, Rehn expressed the view that there should be &quot;considerable transitional periods as well as a permanent safeguard clause&quot;. He was cautious on the question of the inevitability of Turkish membership, stating that he did not &quot;believe in historic determinism&quot;, but that if negotiations were begun, &quot;underpinned by the commitment that [Turkey] will be able to join [the EU] once it fulfils all conditions, it will join as soon as it does meet the conditions&quot;.

He insisted that Bulgaria and Romania would be judged on their merits and that he would not hesitate to delay accession by a year if the EU&#x27;s requirements were not met on time. He considered the establishment of a pre-accession strategy for the Western Balkans one of his prime tasks.

===European sovereign debt crisis===
In late June 2011, Rehn spoke out on austerity measures being considered by the Greek parliament, saying, &quot;The only way to avoid immediate default is for parliament to endorse the revised economic program...The program includes both the medium-term fiscal strategy and the privatization program. They must be approved if the next tranche of financial assistance [a 12 billion euro aid payment] is to be released...To those who speculate about other options, let me say this clearly: there is no Plan B to avoid default&quot;.

In May 2012, coincident with warnings from Mario Draghi of the ECB, Rehn said that even if Eurobonds &quot;were ever approved, it would still not be sufficient to save the euro. The single currency’s members needed &#x27;a genuine stability culture and a much upgraded common capacity to contain common contagion&#x27;, if they wanted to avoid a disintegration of the eurozone and if they wanted it to survive&quot;.

Rehn has continued to maintain that the only way out of the crisis is a continued programme of fiscal austerity. Economist Paul Krugman has been critical of this stance, saying in early 2013 that Olli Rehn, and the economic management of the European Commission, had been proven disastrously wrong in their predictions and management since the beginning of the crisis. He noted, &quot;European leaders seem determined to learn nothing, which makes this more than a tragedy; it’s an outrage.&quot; Krugman maintains that Rehn&#x27;s focus on fiscal discipline is in fact an excuse to dismantle the social safety net and reduce the size of government, as he has criticized countries, such as France which have tried to achieve fiscal discipline through tax increases.

In mid-2013, Rehn claimed that the European Commission was following a pragmatic policy balancing austerity policies with pro-growth policies and that much of the criticism was unfair.

==Member of the European Parliament, 2014–2015==
Rehn was a candidate in the 2014 European election and was elected MEP. In the European Parliament he was elected to be one of the parliament&#x27;s 14 vice presidents.

==Return to Finnish politics==
===Minister of Economic Affairs, 2015–2016===
In 2015, Rehn was elected in the Finnish parliamentary election with 6,837 votes. His term in the European Parliament ended on 27 April, when Rehn officially accepted the seat in the Finnish Parliament. On 29 May 2015, Rehn was appointed the Minister of Economic Affairs in Sipilä Cabinet. During his time in office, he oversaw the country&#x27;s emergence from a three-year recession thanks to a combination of tax and spending cuts. He also played a key role in persuading labor unions to agree to pay cuts to restore competitiveness.

===Bank of Finland, 2016–present===
On 14 October 2016, Rehn was selected to the board of the Bank of Finland. In this capacity, he is in charge of monetary policy implementation and investment of the Bank of Finland&#x27;s financial assets. He is also responsible for the bank&#x27;s digitalisation process and for the activities of the Financial Supervisory Authority, where he is chairman of the board. He continued as a minister and MP till the end of 2016.

Following the resignation of Christine Lagarde as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2019, Rehn was one of the candidates considered by European governments as potential successor; he withdrew his candidacy shortly after and the post went to Kristalina Georgieva instead.

===Presidential election 2024===
In June 2023, Rehn announced his candidacy for 2024 presidential election as an independent candidate. In the election, he placed fourth with 15.32% of the total vote count and failed to advance to the second round of voting.

<text>A gray horse (or grey horse) has a coat color characterized by progressive depigmentation of the colored hairs of the coat. Most gray horses have black skin and dark eyes; unlike some equine dilution genes and some other genes that lead to depigmentation, gray does not affect skin or eye color. Gray horses may be born any base color, depending on other color genes present. White hairs begin to appear at or shortly after birth and become progressively more prevalent as the horse ages as white hairs become intermingled with hairs of other colors. Graying can occur at different rates—very quickly on one horse and very slowly on another. As adults, most gray horses eventually become completely white, though some retain intermixed light and dark hairs. 

The stages of graying vary widely. Some horses develop a d pattern for a period of time, others resemble a roan with more uniform intermixing of light and dark hairs. As they age, some gray horses, particularly those heterozygous for the gray gene, may develop pigmented speckles in addition to a white coat, a pattern colloquially called a &quot;fleabitten gray.&quot; 

Gray horses appear in many breeds, though the color is most commonly seen in breeds descended from Arabian ancestors. Some breeds that have large numbers of gray-colored horses include the Thoroughbred, the Arabian, the American Quarter Horse and the Welsh pony. Breeds with a very high prevalence of gray include the Percheron, the Andalusian, and the Lipizzaner.

People who are unfamiliar with horses may refer to gray horses as &quot;white&quot;. However, a gray horse whose hair coat is completely &quot;white&quot; will still have black skin (except under markings that were white at birth) and dark eyes. This is how to discern a gray horse from a white horse. White horses usually have pink skin and sometimes even have blue eyes. Young horses with hair coats consisting of a mixture of colored and gray or white hairs are sometimes confused with roan. Some horses that carry dilution genes may also be confused with white or gray.

While gray is classified as a coat color by breed registries, genetically it may be more correct to call it a depigmentation pattern. It is a dominant allele, and thus a horse needs only one copy of the gray allele, that is, heterozygous, to be gray in color. A homozygous gray horse, one carrying two gray alleles, will always produce gray foals.

==Prevalence==

Gray is common in many breeds. Today, about one horse in 10 carries the mutation for graying with age. The vast majority of Lipizzaners are gray, as are the majority of Andalusian horses. Many breeds of French draft horse such as the Percheron and Boulonnais are often gray as well. Gray is also found among Welsh Ponies, Thoroughbreds, and American Quarter Horses. All of these breeds have common ancestry in the Arabian horse. In particular, all gray Thoroughbreds descend from a horse named Alcock&#x27;s Arabian, a gray born in 1700. The gray coat color makes up about 3% of Thoroughbreds.

Gray also affects spotting patterns of pintos and leopard complex horses such as Appaloosas. Its effects wash out the contrast of the markings of these patterns, sometimes colloquially described as &quot;ghosting.&quot;

==Changes in the color of gray horses==
A gray foal may be born any color. However, bay, chestnut, or black base colors are most often seen. As the horse matures, it &quot;grays out&quot; as white hairs begin to replace the base or birth color. Usually white hairs are first seen by the muzzle, eyes and flanks, occasionally at birth, and usually by the age of one year. Over time, white hairs replace the birth color. The changing patterns of white and dark hairs have many informal names, such as &quot;rose gray,&quot; &quot;salt and pepper,&quot; &quot;iron gray&quot;, or &quot;dapple gray.&quot; As the horse ages, the coat continues to lighten, often to a pure white. Some horses develop pigmented reddish-brown speckles on an otherwise white hair coat. Such horses are often called &quot;fleabitten gray&quot;.

Different breeds, and individuals within each breed, take differing amounts of time to gray out. Thus, graying cannot be used to approximate the age of a horse except in the broadest of terms: a very young horse will never have a white coat (unless it is a true white horse), while a horse in its teens usually is completely grayed out. One must also be careful not to confuse the small amount of gray hairs that may appear on some older horses in their late teens or twenties, which do not reflect the gray gene and never cause a complete graying of the horse.

This change in hair color means that the same gray horse will appear to be a different color over time, sometimes resulting in a need to change the color noted on breed registry papers. Other times, people traveling with gray horses who have a pure white hair coat have encountered problems with non-horse-oriented officials such as police officers or border guards who are unclear about a horse who has papers saying it is &quot;gray&quot; when the horse in front of them appears white.

To further complicate matters, the skin and eyes may be other colors if influenced by other factors such as white markings, certain white spotting patterns or dilution genes.

==The genetics of gray==

The gray gene (G) is an autosomal dominant gene. In simple terms, a horse which has even one copy of the gray allele, regardless of other coat color genes present, will always become gray. This also means that all gray horses must have at least one gray parent. If a gray horse is homozygous (GG), meaning that it has a gray allele from both parents, it will always produce gray offspring no matter the color genetics of the other parent. However, if a gray horse is heterozygous (Gg), meaning it inherits one copy of the recessive gene (g), that animal may produce offspring who are not gray, depending on the genetics of the other parent and Mendelian inheritance principles. Genetic testing is now possible to determine whether a horse is homozygous or heterozygous for gray. The gray gene does not affect skin or eye color, so grays typically have dark skin and eyes, as opposed to the unpigmented pink skin of white horses.

In 2008, researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden identified the genetic mutation that governs the graying process. The study revealed that all gray horses carry an identical mutation that can be traced back to a common ancestor that lived at least two thousand years ago. The discovery that gray can be linked to a single animal provides an example of how humans have &quot;cherry-picked&quot; attractive mutations in domestic animals.

Gray is controlled by a single dominant allele of a gene that regulates specific kinds of stem cells. Homozygous grays turn white faster, are more likely to develop melanomas, and are less prone to develop the &quot;fleabitten&quot; speckling than heterozygous grays.

Researchers suggest the pigmented speckles of the &quot;fleabitten&quot; gray, as well as more intense reddish-brown colored areas called &quot;blood&quot; markings, may be caused by a loss or inactivation of the gray allele in some of the somatic cells as that would explain why the speckles are more common on heterozygous grays than homozygotes.

===Melanoma in gray horses===


The identification of the gray mutation is of great interest in of medical research since this mutation also enhances the risk for melanoma in horses: some studies have suggested as many as 80% of grays over 15 years of age have some form of melanoma. Growth rate depends on the type, and many are slow-growing, but over time, many develop into a malignant melanoma. 

The study of gray genetics has pointed to a molecular pathway that may lead to tumour development. Both STX17 and the neighboring NR4A3 gene are overexpressed in melanomas from gray horses, and those carrying a loss-of-function mutation in ASIP (agouti signaling protein) had a higher incidence of melanoma, implying that increased melanocortin-1 receptor signaling promotes melanoma development in Gray horses. Some studies indicate as many as 66% of melanomas become malignant, though other studies have found much lower rates, and in one case, zero.

==Horse coat colors sometimes confused with gray==

===White horses===
Many people who are unfamiliar with horses refer to a gray horse as &quot;white&quot;. However, most white horses have pink skin and some have blue eyes. A horse with dark skin and dark eyes under a white hair coat is gray. However, a gray horse with an underlying homozygous cream base coat color may be born with rosy-pink skin, blue eyes and near-white hair. In such cases, DNA testing may clarify the genetics of the horse.

===Roan===

Some grays in intermediate stages of graying may be confused with a roan or a rabicano. Some heavily fleabitten grays may also be confused with roans. However, roans are easily distinguishable from grays: roan consists of individual white hairs on a dark base coat, usually with the head and legs of the horse darker than the rest of the body. Rabicanos also have intermixed white hairs primarily on the body with a dark head. With gray horses, the head is often the first area to lighten, especially around the eyes and muzzle. Also, roans do not lighten with age, while grays always do.

The varnish roan is another unusual coloration, sometimes seen in Appaloosa horses, that, like gray, can change with age, but unlike gray, the horse does not become progressively lighter until it is pure white. Varnish roans are created by the action of leopard complex within breeds such as the Appaloosa and are seldom seen elsewhere.

===Diluted colors===

The dilution genes that create dun, cream, pearl, silver dapple and champagne coloring may occasionally result in confusion with gray.

Some horses with a particular type of dun hair coat known as a &quot;blue dun&quot;, grullo, or &quot;mouse&quot; dun appear to be a solid gray. However, this color is caused by the dun gene acting on a black base coat, and horses who are dun have all hairs the same color; there is no intermingling of white and dark hairs. Also, dun horses do not get lighter as they age. Horses that are a light cream color are also not grays. These are usually cremello, perlino or smoky cream horses, all colors produced by the action of the cream gene. However, if a gray parent passes on the gene, the hairs will turn white like any other gray. Another cream-colored dilution, the pearl gene or &quot;barlink factor&quot;, may also create very light-coated horses. Similarly, the champagne gene can lighten coat color, often producing dappling or light colors that can be confused with gray.

In spite of its name, the silver dapple gene has nothing to do with graying. It is a dilution gene that acts only on a black coat, diluting the coat to a dark brown and the mane to a flaxen shade. Horses that express the silver dapple gene (and do not have the gray gene) are born that color and it will not lighten. However, again, if one parent passes on the gray gene, the gray gene will again be dominant.

==Mythology==

Throughout history, both gray and white horses have been mythologized. As part of its legendary dimension, the gray horse in myth has been depicted with seven heads (Uchaishravas) or eight feet (Sleipnir), sometimes in groups or singly. There are also mythological tales of divinatory gray horses who prophesy or warn of danger.

<text>A Watt&#x27;s linkage is a type of mechanical linkage invented by James Watt in which the central moving point of the linkage is constrained to travel a nearly straight path. Watt&#x27;s described the linkage in his patent specification of 1784 for the Watt steam engine.

Today it is used in automobile suspensions, where it is key to a suspension&#x27;s kinematics, i.e., its motion properties, constraining the vehicle axle&#x27;s movement to nearly vertical travel while also limiting horizontal motion. 

==Description==
Watt&#x27;s linkage consists of three bars bolted together in a chain. The chain of bars consists of two end bars and a middle bar. The middle bar is bolted at each of its ends to one of the ends of each outer bar. The two outer bars are of equal length, and are longer than the middle bar. The three bars can pivot around the two bolts. The outer endpoints of the long bars are fixed in place relative to each other, but otherwise the three bars are free to pivot around the two joints where they meet.

In linkage analysis, there is an imaginary fixed-length bar connecting the outer endpoints. Thus, Watt&#x27;s linkage is an example of a four-bar linkage.

==History==
Its genesis is contained in a letter Watt wrote to Matthew Boulton in June 1784.
The context of Watt&#x27;s innovation has been described by C. G. Gibson:
:During the Industrial Revolution, mechanisms for converting rotary into linear motion were widely adopted in industrial and mining machinery, locomotives and metering devices. Such devices had to combine engineering simplicity with a high degree of accuracy, and the ability to operate at speed for lengthy periods. For many purposes approximate linear motion is an acceptable substitute for exact linear motion. Perhaps the best known example is the Watt four bar linkage, invented by the Scottish engineer James Watt in 1784.

This type of linkage is one of several types described in Watt&#x27;s 28 April 1784 patent specification. However, in his letter to Boulton he was actually describing a development of the linkage which was not included in the patent. The slightly later design, called a parallel motion linkage, led to a more convenient space-saving design which was actually used in his reciprocating, and his rotary, beam engines.
==Shape traced by the linkage==
This linkage does not generate a true straight line motion, and indeed Watt did not claim it did so. Rather, it traces out Watt&#x27;s curve, a lemniscate or figure eight shaped curve; when the lengths of its bars and its base are chosen to form a crossed square, it traces the lemniscate of Bernoulli. In a letter to Boulton on 11 September 1784 Watt describes the linkage as follows.
Although the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage, Hart&#x27;s inversor, and other straight line mechanisms generate true straight-line motion, Watt&#x27;s linkage has the advantage of much greater simplicity than these other linkages. It is similar in this respect to the Chebyshev linkage, a different linkage that produces approximate straight-line motion; however, in the case of Watt&#x27;s linkage, the motion is perpendicular to the line between its two endpoints, whereas in the Chebyshev linkage the motion is parallel to this line.

==Applications==

===Double-acting piston===

The earlier single-action beam engines used a chain to connect the piston to the beam and this worked satisfactorily for pumping water from mines, etc. However, for rotary motion a linkage that works both in compression and tension provides a better design and allows a double-acting cylinder to be used. Such an engine incorporates a piston acted upon by steam alternately on the two sides, hence doubling its power. The linkage actually used by Watt (also invented by him) in his later rotary beam engines was called the parallel motion linkage, a development of &quot;Watt&#x27;s linkage&quot;, but using the same principle. The piston of the engine is attached to the central point of the linkage, allowing it to act on the two outer beams of the linkage both by pushing and by pulling. The nearly linear motion of the linkage allows this type of engine to use a rigid connection to the piston without causing the piston to bind in its containing cylinder. This configuration also results in a smoother motion of the beam than the single-action engine, making it easier to convert its back-and-forth motion into rotation.

An example of Watt&#x27;s linkage can be found on the high and intermediate pressure piston rod of the 1865 Crossness engines. In these engines, the low pressure piston rod uses the more conventional parallel motion linkage, but the high and intermediate pressure rod does not connect to the end of the beam so there is no requirement to save space.

===Vehicle suspension===

Watt&#x27;s linkage is used in the rear axle of some car suspensions as an improvement over the Panhard rod, which was designed in the early twentieth century. Both methods are intended to prevent relative sideways motion between the axle and body of the car. Watt&#x27;s linkage approximates a vertical straight-line motion much more closely, and it does so while consistently locating the centre of the axle at the vehicle&#x27;s longitudinal centreline, rather than toward one side of the vehicle as would be the case if a simple Panhard rod were used.

It consists of two horizontal rods of equal length mounted at each side of the chassis. In between these two rods, a short vertical bar is connected. The center of this short vertical rod – the point which is constrained in a straight line motion - is mounted to the center of the axle. All pivoting points are free to rotate in a vertical plane.

In a way, Watt&#x27;s linkage can be seen as two Panhard rods mounted opposite each other. In Watt&#x27;s arrangement, however, the opposing curved movements introduced by the pivoting Panhard rods largely balance each other in the short vertical rotating bar.

The linkage can be inverted, in which case the centre P is attached to the body, and L1 and L3 mount to the axle. This reduces the unsprung mass and changes the kinematics slightly. This arrangement was used on Australian V8 Supercars until the end of the 2012 season.

Watt&#x27;s linkage can also be used to prevent axle movement in the longitudinal direction of the car. This application involves two Watt&#x27;s linkages on each side of the axle, mounted parallel to the driving direction, but just a single 4-bar linkage is more common in racing suspension systems.

<doc id="1278029" wikidata="Q869389" url="?curid=1278029" title="CQ (call)">
<text>CQ is a station code used by wireless operators derived from long established telegraphic practice on undersea cables and landlines, particularly used by those communicating in Morse code, (), but also by voice operators, to make a general call (called a &quot;CQ call&quot;). Transmitting the letters &quot;CQ&quot; on a particular radio frequency means that the transmission is a broadcast or &quot;General Call&quot; to anyone listening, and when the operator sends &quot;K&quot; or says &quot;Go Ahead&quot; it is an invitation for any licensed radio station listening on that frequency to respond. Its use on radio matched the existing use on Morse landline telegraphy and dates from the earliest wireless stations. It was widely used in point-to-point diplomatic and press services, maritime, aviation, and police services until those services eliminated Morse radiotelegraphy. It is still widely used in amateur radio which still has active use of Morse radiotelegraphy.

==History and usage==

The CQ station code was originally used by land line and undersea cable telegraphy operators in the United Kingdom. An early land line reference to CQ is contained in &quot;Electrical Tables and Formulæ: For Use of Telegraph Inspectors and Operators&quot; (1871), which lists &quot;The call for &#x27;all stations&#x27; (C Q)...&quot;. Additionally, in 1884 the telegraphic station code &quot;CQ&quot; was mentioned in &quot;The Practical Telegraphist&quot; (1884), which lists &quot;CQ all stations&quot;; and &quot;The Telegraphist&quot; (August 1884).

International Morse was adopted by the Marconi Company in 1904 for use in wireless telegraphy, at that time via spark-gap transmitters, and was adopted internationally at the London 1912 International Radiotelegraph Convention, and is still in use.

A variant of the &#x27; call, &#x27;, was the first code used as a distress signal. It was proposed by the Marconi Company and adopted in 1904, but was replaced between 1906 and 1908 by the prosign. When the &quot;Titanic&quot; sank in 1912, it initially transmitted the distress call &#x27; (with &#x27; being the ship&#x27;s call sign). &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s radio operator subsequently alternated between &#x27; and &#x27; calls afterwards.

In amateur radio use, a &#x27; call can be qualified by appending more letters, as in &#x27; (meaning &quot;calling all stations located on a different continent from the caller&quot;), or the ITU call sign prefix for a particular country (e.g. &#x27; for &quot;calling Australia&quot; or &#x27; for &quot;calling Japan&quot;). The originator of the call is normally identified by appending the letters &#x27; (French for &quot;from&quot;, also means &quot;this is ...&quot;) and the call sign of the transmitting station. Another common qualifier is &#x27;, followed by the sender&#x27;s station ID, which is used in ham radio contests. When using CW mode, unattended receivers connected to a computer may automatically decode the signal and log it on the Reverse Beacon Network.

In the use of single-sideband (SSB) voice or CW mode (morse code telegraphy), an amateur radio operator often makes a general call by transmitting &#x27; repeatedly (such as &#x27;) so that other operators scanning for such calls are aided by the familiar rhythmic sound in quickly discriminating distant (weak signal) general callers from other traffic and spurious emissions. This technique allows the other operators to zero-in as close to the caller&#x27;s center frequency using the human ear to fine-tune their transceiver before engaging the caller in a two-way communication.

The use of a CQ call is almost always used in single-sideband (SSB) voice or CW mode (morse code telegraphy). Unlike FM mode, in the SSB voice and CW mode areas of the amateur radio bands operators are free to center their transmissions where it is most optimal (such as away from adjacent traffic that can interfere) and not expected to use whole-number, divisible-by-five, or otherwise channelized center frequencies. CQ is in constant use on the amateur bands on shortwave but very rarely used in the FM voice mode of transmission or on FM repeaters common on the VHF and UHF local bands, since tuning of a repeater or FM signal does not require the aid of human perception to perfectly tune the signal.

The code &quot;dah dit dah dit, dah dah dit dah&quot; (the vocalization of ) was used as part of the chorus to the song &quot;Communications&quot; by Slim Gaillard.

<text>Nissim Mordechai Ze&#x27;ev (; born 9 September 1951) is an Israeli politician. One of the founders of Shas, he served as Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem between 1983 and 1998, and as a member of Knesset from 1999 until 2015.

==Biography==
Ze&#x27;ev was born and resides in Jerusalem. He is married, and has a large family. He is a graduate of Porat Yosef Yeshiva, and was ordained to the Rabbinate. He has served as a Rabbi, Shochet, Mohel, and Chazzan in Israel and abroad.

He began his Torah activities in his youth when, in 1968, he established Torah youth clubs named &quot;Irgun Yeladim Lomdei Torah&quot; (&quot;Association of Children Who Study Torah&quot;). They were established in memory of the IDF soldiers who died when the INS Eilat was lost in 1967. Hundreds of students participated in this club in the afternoon studying &quot;Ta&#x27;amei Hamikra&quot; (Torah incantations), Psalms, Jewish Law, and Jewish Legend.

In 1971, Ze&#x27;ev served as a rabbi and shochet in the Ein HaEmek moshav. Three years later, he was sent abroad as a shochet and inspector on behalf of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. He would ultimately spend five years away from Israel, going to Mexico City in 1977, to help establish the Aram Tzova Kollel, then to the &quot;Sephardic Jewish Center&quot; in Brooklyn, New York, where he served as rabbi and chazzan. In 1979, he returned to Israel to establish the &quot;Nevat Israel&quot; Institutes for Sephardic Jewish girls - ranging from kindergarten, to elementary schools, to high schools, and to a teaching seminary to train teachers and kindergarten teachers.

===Political career===
In the summer of 1983, he established a non-profit organization called the &quot;Sephardic Association of Torah Observers&quot;, and served as its chairman. In addition to educational, cultural, and charitable activities, the association was involved in the selection of representatives to appear as a political list for the elections for local municipalities and the Knesset. The first meeting of the association convened shortly thereafter in the Yesodei Torah Yeshiva in Jerusalem. Participants included the president of the Torah Elders Council, Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, as well as Rabbi Shalom Cohen, Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka (Head of the Porat Yoseph Yeshiva), and Rabbi Shabtai Aton. With their blessings, the Shas party ran for the first time for the local elections in Jerusalem, with Ze&#x27;ev at its head, and succeeded in winning three seats. Between 1983 and 1998, Ze&#x27;ev served as deputy mayor of Jerusalem in charge of the Welfare Department, as well as chairman of the Allotments of Land for Public Institutes and chairman of the Exemption Committee for Arnona. He was a candidate in the 1993 Jerusalem mayoral election, but finished third with only 5% of the vote.

In 1999, Ze&#x27;ev was elected to the Knesset on the Shas list, and was re-elected in 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2013. During his time in the Knesset, he served as a member of the Knesset Committee, the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee, and the Committee on Interior Affairs. In the 17th Knesset (2006–2009), he served as chairman of the Knesset Committee on the War Against Drugs and Alcohol, coordinating with all the relevant agencies and holding many meetings which led to a body of legislation to fight drug and alcohol abuse.

He was not included in the Shas list for the 2015 elections after being removed from the list by Shas leader Aryeh Deri.

==Views==
Ze&#x27;ev is known for his strong opposition to the evacuation of Jews from Israeli settlements. To advance this cause, he established the Knesset Caucus for Israel, Judaism, and Global Ethics, and presented legislative proposals to prevent the evacuation of settlers against their will. Among the other laws initiated by him are the Law to Increase Child Allotments, the Law to Punish Terrorists, the Abortion Law, the Incitement Law, and the Law to Recognize the Rights of Jewish Refugees from Arab Lands.

In June 2007, he compared homosexuals to drug addicts, and suggested that rehabilitation centers be set up for them throughout Israel, saying: &quot;The government should initiate this; these people are unfortunate, and we must keep an eye on them to assist them... I am not speaking of a closed institution, but of a center that will accept anyone who walks through its doors... We must set up special teams of psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers who will help them return to a normal life, just like in a drug rehabilitation center.&quot;

He also claimed that gay people must be made aware of &quot;how their lifestyle is destroying our existence&quot;, and that MKs &quot;propose numerous bills to help barren women become more fertile, but on the other hand, we allow this immorality&quot;.

<doc id="1278037" wikidata="Q565302" url="?curid=1278037" title="Arouca, Portugal">
<text>Arouca () is a town and a municipality in the Metropolitan Area of Porto, in the Norte Region of Portugal and in the Aveiro District. The population in 2011 was 22,359, in an area of . It had 20,383 electors in 2006. The population has grown from 7072 inhabitants in 1801.

The entire territory of Arouca is &quot;Arouca Geopark&quot; which is a member of the European Geoparks Network and Global Geoparks Network on account of its outstanding geological heritage, educational programs and projects, and promotion of geotourism.

==History==
The territory that became Arouca was settled by vestiges of pre-historic tribes, but it was in the Roman occupation that the first artifacts associated with settlement first appeared. From archaeological excavations, it is known that the area was settled late in the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula (due to its distance from coastal and north–south accesses). From local toponomy, the permanence of Germanic tribes is evident; names such as Sá, Saril, Alvarenga, Burgo, Escariz, Friães and Melareses, are examples of this influence.

Following Moorish invasion more information began to be recorded in this region. Christian settlements that existed within the area were abandoned during this time, and moved to other northern access points. These settlements later returned following the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, when instability in the region disappeared. The history of Arouca, therefore, only became available with the founding and growth of the Monastery of Arouca, culminating in the religious life of D. Mafalda, daughter of the second King, D. Sancho I. It was this monastery, which for many centuries, that the populace of the region depended. The monastery was erected in the 10th century, in the invocation of Saint Peter, by two noblemen: Loderigo and Vandilo, from Moldes. The primitive building was nothing more than a simple dwelling, supporting a complement of monks and nuns.

By the 12th century, D. Toda Viegas and his family became principal patrons of the monastery, resulting in a growth of wealth and prestige. D. Afonso Henriques, even before national independence, conceded the Viegas and the monastery&#x27;s monks various privileges and donations. They received various charters between 1132 and 1143.

In the first years of the 13th century, the monastery of Arouca passed into the hands of the Crown, and D. Sancho I left the complex in his testament to his daughter D. Mafalda. She entered monastic life between 1217 and 1220. Her presence resulted in a period of splendor and importance, not merely for her presence, but also her material wealth, which she brought into monastic service. By this time, the monastery was a sanctuary for nuns, and the principal economic center of the Arouca valley. Following the death of D. Mafalda, in 1256, the prestige of the monastery continued, carried on by here former support, memory, religious and cult. She was beatified in 1792 and her remains placed in an urn, executed in ebony, crystal, silver and bronze in one of the wings of the monastery&#x27;s church (where her body was later moved in 1793).

The municipality of Arouca evolved from a long process over the centuries, inheriting civil parishes and integrating municipalities from the 19th century. The municipality of Vila Meã do Burgo originated the parish of Burgo, which was annexed by Arouca in 1817. With the extinction of the municipalities of Alvarenga (1836) and Fermêdo (1855) many of the former parishes were integrated into Arouca: the parishes of Santa Cruz de Alvarenga, Canelas, Janarde and Espiunca were folded in from Alvarenga and the parishes of São Miguel do Mato, Fermêdo, Escariz and Mansores were annexed from Fermêdo. The parish of Covêlo de Paivó, which belong to the municipality of São Pedro do Sul, was annexed in 1917.

The historical centre of Arouca, which included many the current parishes was constituted by the seats of São Bartolomeu (in 1846 the parishes of São Bartolomeu de Arouca and Santo Estêvão de Moldes), Cabreiros, Albergaria da Serra, part of São Salvador do Burgo, Santa Eulália, São Miguel de Urrô, Várzea, Rossas, Santa Marinha de Tropêço and Chave.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===

The Arouca is a fertile valley, almost entirely enclosed with a mountainous plateau, with only the western edge open to the rest of the country. To the north is the Serra do Gamarão, to the east the conic mountain of Mó and the Serra da Freita ao Sul., and to the south is the ridge of Montemuro (the highest point in the municipality). Here is situated the Pedra Posta, at approximately , relatively close to the Noninha.

The existence of tungsten mines in this region, has historical attracted foreign mineral exploration companies. In the towns of Rio de Frades (parish of Cabreiros) and Regoufe (parish of Covêlo de Paivó), until the end of the Second World War, there functioned both English and German mining companies, that continued their mining operations (although at less intense levels) until the 1960s. The ruins of these mines and numerous pits are visible in the parishes of Alvarenga and Janarde, a testament to the authentic &quot;gold fever&quot; associated with the mining industry here.

===Biome===

<doc id="1278058" wikidata="Q1751280" url="?curid=1278058" title="Redbone (band)">
<text>Redbone is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1969 by brothers Pat and Lolly Vegas. All members during their commercial peak and success were of Mexican American and Native American heritage, which was heavily reflected in their songs, stage costumes, and album art.

They reached the Top 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1974 with their hit single, &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot;. The single went certified Gold selling over a million copies. It also made Redbone the first Native American band to reach the top five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with the song reaching number 5. Redbone achieved success in the United States with their singles &quot;We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee&quot;, &quot;The Witch Queen of New Orleans&quot;, &quot;Wovoka&quot;, and &quot;Maggie&quot;, although these songs were more successful overseas.

Pat has been the sole consistent member of the band since Lolly&#x27;s death in 2010.

==History==
Born in Coalinga, California, near Fresno, brothers Patrick (bass and vocals) and Candido &quot;Lolly&quot; Vasquez-Vegas (guitar and vocals) moved to Los Angeles in 1959 and played for ten years in clubs under the name of Pat and Lolly Vegas. Pat won Coca-Cola&#x27;s first singing competition in 1958 at age 17. He also won a recording contract, which he put off to move to Los Angeles with Lolly. They performed at local clubs on Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard (such as Gazzari&#x27;s) while writing and playing on records by Tina Turner, Sonny &amp; Cher, James Brown, Little Richard, and Elvis, among other artists.

The word &quot;redbone&quot; is a Louisiana term for a mixed-race person, which the band adopted to signify their mixed ancestry. The Vasquez-Vegas brothers were of Yaqui, Shoshone, and Mexican heritage. The band often alluded to Cajun and New Orleans culture in their lyrics and performing style. The brothers began by performing and recording surf music as the &quot;Vegas Brothers&quot;, &quot;because their agent told them that the world was not yet ready to embrace a duo of Mexican musicians playing surfing music&quot;. First as the Vegas Brothers, then later as the Crazy Cajun Cakewalk Band, Pat and Lolly performed throughout the 1960s at venues on the Sunset Strip.

Before forming Redbone, Pat and Lolly released an album in October 1965 entitled &quot;Pat &amp; Lolly Vegas at the Haunted House&quot; (Mercury MG 21059/SR 61059). Of the twelve songs on the album, six were originals by the Vasquez-Vegas brothers which earned them some early success. Pat and Lolly also appeared on the mid-&#x27;60s hit show &quot;Shindig!&quot; repeatedly, becoming regular performers. They also released several singles from 1961 to the mid-1960s, one titled &quot;Robot Walk&quot; / &quot;Don&#x27;t You Remember&quot; (Apogee Records A-101), helping to make a name for themselves in their early years.

In 1967, P.J. Proby recorded his only Top-30 hit, &quot;Niki Hoeky&quot;, written by Jim Ford, Lolly Vegas, and Pat Vegas. The next year, Bobbie Gentry performed the Cajun-influenced song on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; and included it on her smash-hit album, &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot;. Pat Vegas also wrote songs for names like Aretha Franklin amongst others.

According to Pat Vegas, Jimi Hendrix, inspired the musicians to form an all-Native American rock group. They signed as the band &#x27;Redbone&#x27; to Epic Records in 1969. The band then consisted of Pat Vegas, Lolly Vegas, Peter DePoe and Robert Anthony Avila, a Yaqui-Mexican American, better known by his stage name Tony Bellamy. Their debut album &quot;Redbone&quot; was released in 1970.

Redbone played primarily rock music with R&amp;B, Cajun, blue-eyed soul, funk, country, tribal, and Latin roots. Their first world commercial success came with the single &quot;The Witch Queen of New Orleans&quot; (from &quot;Message from a Drum&quot;) that peaked at No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and followed by the single &quot;Maggie&quot; from their second album, &quot;Potlatch&quot;. &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; followed as a big No. 5 hit for Redbone and remained on the chart for 24 weeks being certified gold by the R.I.A.A. on April 22, 1974. Redbone was also the opening act introducing the first Earth Day to the world in Philadelphia along with Senator Edmund Muskie. Their opening song was &quot;Chant 13th Hour&quot; from the &quot;Potlatch&quot; album.

Redbone&#x27;s music was characterized by the Leslie rotating speaker effect that Lolly Vegas used for his electric guitar amplifier and a &quot;King Kong&quot; style of drumming developed by drummer Peter DePoe. This Leslie effect was developed while rehearsing at Dress Revue Sound Studios in Hollywood, California in the early 1970s.

The first self-titled album by Redbone was released as a double album in North America. In Europe, it was released both as a double (EPC 67242) and as a single album (BN 26280) on the Epic label.

Their third album, &quot;Message from a Drum&quot;, was released in Europe (except Spain) with the title &quot;The Witch Queen of New Orleans&quot; and a different cover than the one released in the U.S. and Canada.

In 1973, Redbone released the politically oriented &quot;We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee&quot;, recalling both the massacre of Lakota Sioux Indians by the 7th Cavalry Regiment in 1890 and the 71-day Wounded Knee Occupation that occurred a few months before the song&#x27;s release. The song ends with the subtly altered sentence &quot;We were all wounded &#x27;by&#x27; Wounded Knee&quot;. It charted in several European countries and reached the No. 1 position in the Netherlands but did not chart in the U.S., where it was initially withheld from release due to lyrical controversy and then banned by several radio stations due to its confrontation of a sore subject. DePoe had left this band in 1972. He was replaced by Arturo Perez (1939- ), but later by Bellamy&#x27;s Filipino-Chicano cousin, Butch Rillera around that point. Following this the band achieved much of their commercial success. Tony Bellamy (guitar, piano and vocals) left the band in 1977, with Rillera leaving shortly after.

The band&#x27;s current remaining membership is led by Pat Vegas, although an array of new members have joined Redbone since then due to Lolly Vegas suffering a stroke that left him unable to tour with the band. No member has been official other than Pat Vegas after the original members were not present. A proposed reunion tour in 2003 did not occur. There is evidence that suggests the existence of an &quot;imposter band&quot; (one of many who try to gain recognition) who was illegally touring the United States and posing as Redbone under the name (or alias) &quot;Denny Freeman&quot;. Freeman - who Pat Vegas confirmed to be unaffiliated with Redbone in an interview with the &quot;Montana Standard&quot; - defrauded the county fair board of the Butte Silver-Bow County Fair in Butte, Montana, under pretenses of being a co-founding member of Redbone, yet he was never a band member.

On December 25, 2009, Tony Bellamy died of liver failure at a hospital in his hometown of Las Vegas, at age 63. Less than three months later, Lolly Vegas died of lung cancer at his family home in Reseda, California, on March 4, 2010, at age 70.

Redbone headlined the Inaugural Indigenous Peoples Day event along with Pat Vegas&#x27;s son PJ Vegas, daughter Frankie Vegas, and The Black Eyed Peas at Los Angeles City Hall on October 8, 2018, Grand Park. This was the first indigenous celebration commemorating this change that took two years to complete. Spearheaded by LA Council member Mitch O&#x27;Farrell, they honored the largest native community in the United States, Los Angeles, and the native people who first inhabited LA, the Tongva people.

Pat Vegas continues to tour in the United States and Canada in support of his solo albums, &quot;Ambergris&quot;, &quot;Peacepipe&quot;, &quot;Speed of Sound&quot;, and &quot;Buffalo Bluz&quot;. He also is part of a touring version of Redbone that plays both his solo efforts and the hits from the band&#x27;s heyday.

==Musical style and influences==

Redbone&#x27;s music was primarily rock music, but incorporated elements of rock and roll, funk, folk music, blues, swamp funk, Tex-Mex, rhythm and blues, indigenous music of North America, soul music, soft rock, hard rock, Cajun music, jazz and Latin music. The band&#x27;s style was classified as swamp rock.

==Awards and accolades==
Redbone was inducted into the Native American Music Association Hall of Fame in 2008, as well as the NY Smithsonian in 2013. They were also honored with vein painted on the largest mural in the U.S. in Fresno, California. On August 30, 2014, Pat Vegas was honored with the Lifetime Achievement &quot;Legend&quot; Award from the &quot;West Coast American Indian Music Awards.&quot;

In 1997, &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; was featured in the Kevin Costner movie, &quot;The Postman.&quot;

In 2014, &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; experienced a resurgence in popularity when it was featured in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; as one of the songs on a mixtape made for the protagonist, Peter Quill. It was also included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, which reached the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It later appeared in the film&#x27;s second sequel, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;, released in 2023.

In 2015, &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; was used as the intro theme to Netflix produced cartoon series &quot;F is for Family&quot;.

In 2018, in France, &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; was featured in a Bouygues Telecom television commercial showing three successive generations appreciating the song.

In 2018, Pat Vegas was awarded with the &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; from the Indigenous Music Awards.

In 2021, &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; was featured in episode 5 of the FX show, &quot;Reservation Dogs&quot;.

<text>Lagunen-Walzer (Lagoon-Waltz) op. 411 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II written in 1883. The waltz melodies are drawn from his operetta Eine Nacht in Venedig (A Night in Venice) which was a fiasco when premiered in Berlin on 3 October 1883.

The waltz&#x27;s primary melody was from the Act 3 song by the character Duke of Urbino. The Berlin production incorporated many outrageously silly lyrics during this waltz song where the singer has to sing the embarrassing &#x27;Nacht sind die Katzen ja grau, nachts tönt es zärtlich Miau!&#x27; (At night, the cats are grey, at night &quot;meow&quot; they tenderly say!&#x27;).

Without further ado, for the hurried Vienna premiere, the tempo was reduced and the words were replaced with the more agreeable &#x27;Ach, wie so herrlich zu schaun, sind all&#x27; die lieblichen Frau&#x27;n!&#x27; (Oh, how splendid to see, all of these lovely ladies!).

Eduard Strauss first performed the orchestral work on 4 November 1883 in the Golden Hall (Goldener-Saal) of the Vienna Musikverein, site of the modern day Neujahrskonzert.

<doc id="1278063" wikidata="Q949020" url="?curid=1278063" title="1991 Los Angeles runway collision">
<text>On the evening of Friday, February 1, 1991, USAir Flight 1493, a Boeing 737-300, collided with SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569, a Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner turboprop aircraft, upon landing at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). As Flight 1493 was on final approach, the local controller was distracted, though air traffic was not heavy at LAX, by a series of abnormalities, including a misplaced flight progress strip and an aircraft that had inadvertently switched off the tower frequency. The SkyWest flight was told to taxi into takeoff position, while the USAir flight was landing on the same runway.

Upon landing, the 737 collided with the smaller turboprop Metroliner, which was crushed beneath the larger USAir jet as it continued down the runway, caught fire, and veered into an airport fire station. Rescue workers arrived in minutes and began to evacuate the 737, but because of the intense fire, three of the 737&#x27;s six exits were unusable, including both front exits; front passengers could only use one of the two overwing exits, causing a bottleneck. All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, along with an eventual total of 23 of the 89 occupants of the 737, with most deaths on the 737 caused by asphyxiation in the fire. 

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the probable cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading to a loss of situational awareness by the local controller, and inadequate oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for failing to supervise the control tower managers. The crash led directly to the NTSB&#x27;s recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX.

== Background ==
=== Aircraft and crew ===

USAir Flight 1493 was a scheduled service from Syracuse, New York, making stops at Washington, DC, Columbus, Ohio, and LAX, before continuing to San Francisco. On February 1, 1991, Flight 1493 was operated using a Boeing 737-300 (registration ); after a crew change in Washington, DC, it was under the command of Captain Colin Franklin Shaw (48), a highly experienced pilot with about 16,300 total flight hours (including more than 4,300 hours on the Boeing 737), and First Officer David T. Kelly (32), who had about 4,300 total flight hours, with 982 hours on the Boeing 737. Flying into LAX, the aircraft had 89 people on board (83 passengers, four flight attendants, and the two pilots).

On February 1, 1991, SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569 was operated using a twin-engined Fairchild Metroliner (registration ). The flight was scheduled to depart LAX on the final leg of a multicity schedule, and was bound for Palmdale, California, with 10 passengers and two pilots aboard. The aircraft did not carry a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) or a flight data recorder (FDR), as it was not required to do so at the time. Both of Flight 5569&#x27;s pilots had significant experience; Captain Andrew Lucas (32), had roughly 8,800 flight hours (with 2,101 of them on the Metroliner), and First Officer Frank Prentice (45), had over 8,000 flight hours, including 1,363 hours on the Metroliner.

=== Airport ===
LAX has four parallel runways, with the two runways and associated taxiways north of the terminal called the North Complex.

=== Air traffic control ===
The air traffic controller (ATC) in charge of takeoffs and landings in the LAX tower (the local controller) was Robin Lee Wascher. She had been working in the role since 1982, and began working at LAX in 1989. The clearance delivery controller in charge of taxiing aircraft was Francita Vandiver, who had previously served as an ATC in the US Navy. She had been working at LAX since 1988.

== Accident details ==

=== Flight ===

Skywest 5569 was cleared by ATC Wascher in the LAX tower to taxi to Runway 24L, moving from gate 32 to the runway via taxiways Kilo, 48, Tango, and 45. 

Immediately prior to SkyWest 5569 reaching runway 24L, a Wings West aircraft had landed on 24R and was awaiting permission to cross 24L and taxi to the terminal. The local controller attempted to contact the Wings West aircraft, but the crew had changed frequencies and did not answer, distracting Wascher as she attempted to reestablish communications. Shortly after 6 PM local time, as USAir 1493 was on final approach to LAX, the SkyWest Metroliner was cleared by the local controller to taxi into position and hold on Runway 24L at the intersection of taxiway 45, some up from the runway threshold. After four attempts by the local controller, the Wings West aircraft finally responded to the tower and apologized for switching frequencies. Wascher then cleared the USAir flight to land on 24L, even though the SkyWest Metroliner was still holding in takeoff position on the runway:
With this activity ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting they were ready for takeoff. Wascher queried this aircraft about their position, and they told her they were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The flight progress strip for this flight had not yet been given to Wascher by controller Vandiver (another distraction), and Wascher mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569, thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation, but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway. Meanwhile, Wascher was busy handling other flights:

The USAir plane touched down near the runway threshold. Just as the nose was being lowered, the first officer noticed SkyWest 5569 on the runway and applied maximum braking, but it was too late. The following was recorded on the CVR:

The USAir plane slammed into the Metroliner, crushing it beneath its fuselage. The 737 proceeded to skid down the runway, then veered off the left side and came to rest on the far side of the taxiway against a closed fire station building, where it eventually caught fire. Large debris from the Metroliner – including its tail, wings, and right engine – were found on the runway and between the runway and the abandoned fire station.

The accident was witnessed from a plane carrying the Vancouver Canucks, who were arriving for a National Hockey League game against the Los Angeles Kings.
The captain of that charter aircraft, having just landed, powered up the engines to get away from the fireball of the accident. The team was unsure if the USAir 737 was going to stop before it collided with their plane. The Canucks were shaken by the experience and lost to the Kings by a score of 9–1, their worst loss of the 1990–91 season.

=== Fatalities and injuries ===

The 35 dead included all 12 people (10 passengers and both crew members) on SkyWest 5569, and 23 of the 89 aboard the USAir 1493 (21 passengers, Captain Shaw, and 22-year-old lead flight attendant Deanna Bethea). Two of the USAir fatalities were passengers who initially survived the crash, but died from burn injuries three and 31 days after the crash.

Captain Shaw was killed when the nose of the aircraft struck the abandoned fire station, crushing the section of the cockpit where his seat was located. Of the remaining passengers and crew aboard USAir 1493, two crew members and 10 passengers sustained serious injuries, 2 crew members and 15 passengers sustained minor injuries, and 37 passengers received no injuries. Billionaire businessman David H. Koch was among the survivors.

The majority of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those seated in the front of the plane, where the postcrash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737&#x27;s damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries. Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The majority of the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door. The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident, but was quickly closed due to the spreading fire on that side of the aircraft. Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seatback of the exit window seat being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit.

From the location of the bodies, only two victims on USAir 1493 were found in their seats, while authorities believe that 17 had unbuckled their seat belts and died from smoke inhalation while making their way to the exits. According to James Burnett, who headed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation team, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of a recent accident where this many people have been up and out of their seats and didn&#x27;t make it out.&quot; The captain was one of the few people who died of blunt force trauma, a blow to the head when the bulkhead collapsed as the aircraft collided with the firehouse. The first officer was rescued through the cockpit windows by some of the first firefighters to arrive on the accident scene.

Shaw was found to have traces of phenobarbital in his blood. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits use of the sedative before flying. The drug was prescribed for irritable bowel syndrome by Shaw&#x27;s physicians, who said they had warned him not to use the medication while flying.

== Investigation ==
First Officer David Kelly, who was flying the USAir 1493 during the accident leg, reported that he did not see SkyWest 5569 until he lowered the nose of his aircraft onto the runway after landing. Kelly also said that he applied the brakes, but did not have enough time for evasive action. Statements made by passengers who survived the crash were consistent with this testimony.

Local controller Wascher, who cleared both aircraft to use the same runway, testified before the NTSB and accepted blame for causing the crash. She said she originally thought the landing USAir plane had been hit by a bomb, then &quot;realized something went wrong... I went to the supervisor and I said, &#x27;I think this (the SkyWest plane) is what USAir hit.&#x27;&quot; She testified that rooftop lights in her line of sight caused glare in the tower, making seeing small planes difficult at the intersection where the SkyWest plane was positioned. Just before the accident, she confused the SkyWest plane with another commuter airliner that was on a taxiway near the end of the runway. Making matters more difficult, the ground radar at LAX was not working on the day of the accident.

The NTSB&#x27;s investigation of the crash revealed that the cockpit crew of the landing USAir jet could not see the commuter plane, which blended in with other airport lights. The NTSB cited LAX&#x27;s procedures which placed much of the responsibility for runways on the local controllers, which directly led to the loss of situational awareness by the local controller. The NTSB also noted that during the previous performance review, a supervisor had noted four deficiencies in the local controller who ultimately worked the accident aircraft. These deficiencies were not addressed prior to the accident, and two of the deficiencies were apparent in the accident sequence—her loss of situational awareness and aircraft misidentification.

The NTSB&#x27;s investigation of the crash revealed a failing system in the air- and ground-traffic control facilities at LAX: the ground radar system worked intermittently, and was not functioning at the time of the incident; the blind spot, from the control tower, when looking at the spot where SkyWest 5569 was waiting on the runway; the system for ground controllers in the tower to pass flight progress strips to the local controller did not support the local controller&#x27;s workload; aircraft on runways were not required to turn on all their external lights until rolling for takeoff. All these issues were rectified at LAX following this incident.

At the time of the accident, ATCs at LAX used all four runways (North Complex runways 24L and 24R, South Complex runways 25L and 25R) for mixed takeoffs and landings. One of the NTSB recommendations was that the runways be segregated with only landings or departures taking place on an individual runway. This recommendation was implemented, but not until after another incident, when on August 19, 2004, a Boeing 747 landing on 24L passed only above a 737 holding on the same runway.

== Aftermath ==
LAX now prioritizes the use of the outboard runways (24R and 25L) for landings and the inboard runways (24L and 25R) for takeoffs, though mixed operations may occur in certain situations. Additionally, a new control tower was built at LAX, in a more central location, significantly taller and with a better vantage point, allowing visibility of all runways and critical taxiways at the airport.

Before this accident, the FAA issued a ruling that required airlines to upgrade the flammability standards of materials on board, but the USAir plane had been built before the effective date of those requirements and had not yet been modernized. It was scheduled to be upgraded within the next year. By 2009, all aircraft operating in the United States were compliant.

Air traffic controller Wascher, who bore the immediate responsibility for the crash, was adjudged to have made an error in adverse circumstances that any air traffic controller could have made and was not prosecuted or fired. She declined an offer to return to air traffic control and took a desk job at the FAA&#x27;s western regional office.

== Dramatization ==
The story of the disaster was featured in a ninth-season episode of the Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic series &quot;Mayday&quot;. The episode, titled &quot;Cleared for Disaster&quot;, explores the events surrounding the crash and its investigation, including interviews with NTSB investigators, first responders, survivors, and witnesses.

It is featured in season 1, episode 3, of the TV show &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;, in an episode called &quot;Human Error&quot;.

TLC also aired a segment on the crash in the 1990s special called Terror in the Sky. It featured an interview with billionaire David Koch who survived the accident, as well as footage of the aftermath of the collision.

<doc id="1278065" wikidata="Q923362" url="?curid=1278065" title="Jacmel">
<text>Jacmel (; ) is a commune in southern Haiti founded by the Spanish in 1504 and repopulated by the French in 1698. It is the capital of the department of Sud-Est, 24 miles (39 km) southwest of Port-au-Prince across the Tiburon Peninsula, and has an estimated population of 40,000, while the commune of Jacmel had a population of 137,966 at the 2003 Census. The town&#x27;s name is derived from its indigenous Taíno name of &quot;Yaquimel&quot;. In 1925, Jacmel was dubbed as the &quot;City of Light,&quot; becoming the first in the Caribbean to have electricity.

The city is known for its well-preserved Gingerbread houses built in the early 19th century. The town has been tentatively accepted as a World Heritage Site. It sustained damage in the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

Jacmel is home to the country&#x27;s leading film school, the Ciné Institute.

==History==

The town was founded by the &quot;Compagnie de Saint-Domingue&quot; in 1698 as the capital of the southeastern part of the French colony Saint-Domingue. The area now called Jacmel was Taíno territory, part of the Xaragua chiefdom ruled by cacique Bohechio. With the arrival of the French, and the later establishment of the town, the French renamed Yaquimel as Jacmel.

The city was developed to boost sugar production and trade, but soon it evolved into a coffee trading centre. In 1896 it suffered a major fire that destroyed most of the buildings in the city. The city was rebuilt, often using prefabricated cast-iron pillars and balconies shipped from France. Many ornate mansions of wealthy coffee merchants from this time have been preserved up to this day without much change and the whole central part of the city has changed little over the last 100 years.

The mansions of Jacmel, with their cast-iron pillars and balconies, would later influence the homes in much of New Orleans. Today, many of these homes are now artisan shops that sell vibrant handicrafts, papier-mâché masks, and carved-wood animal figures. In recent years, efforts have been made to revitalize the once flourishing cigar and coffee industries. The town is a popular tourist destination in Haiti due to its relative tranquility and distance from the political turmoil that plagues Port-au-Prince.

Over the years, this rather small town experienced a number of noted historical events. Some of these occurrences are:

===Haitian Revolution and War of Knives===
In 1791 and 1792, Romaine-la-Prophétesse led thirteen thousand rebels in besieging, occupying, and later burning Jacmel, and taking weapons and supplies from (and then burning) surrounding plantations from Marigot, about 25 kilometers east of Jacmel, to Bainet, about 45 kilometers west of it, freeing their slaves.

Toussaint Louverture fought over Jacmel in the so-called War of Knives between him and his fellow countryman André Rigaud, who wished to maintain authority over the city. This war began in June 1799. By November the rebels were pushed back to this strategic southern port, the defence of which was commanded by Alexandre Pétion. Jacmel fell to Toussaint&#x27;s troops in February 1800. Pétion and other mulatto leaders subsequently went into exile in France.

===Creation of the Gran Colombia flag===
A Venezuelan predecessor of Simón Bolívar in the liberation struggle against colonialism in Venezuelan and much of Spanish-ruled South America, Francisco de Miranda created the first flag of Gran Colombia near Jacmel, which served as the national flag of the First Republic of Venezuela. Anchored in the Bay of Jacmel (&quot;Baie de Jacmel&quot;), he first raised the flag on March 12, 1806, on the corvette &quot;Leander&quot;. This day is still celebrated as Venezuelan Flag Day. The general design of the Gran Colombian flag served as the model for the current flags of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, which emerged as independent nations at the breakup of Gran Colombia in 1830. This flag is often referred to as the &quot;bandera madre&quot; (mother flag) due to its role as inspiration and resemblance to the flags of Colombia and Ecuador.

===Ramón Emeterio Betances===
Puerto Rican pro-independence leader Ramón Emeterio Betances spent a short interval in Jacmel in 1870, from where he gathered support for an uprising in the Dominican Republic, seeking to install a liberal government there. Then-president of Haiti, Nissage Saget supported Betances&#x27;s ideals of a pan-Antillean union and gave the uprising his support.

===Modern Jacmel prior to the 12 January 2010 earthquake===

The port town is internationally known for its very vibrant art scene and elegant townhouses dating from the 19th century. Among the wealth of art and crafts available in Jacmel are the papier-mâché, done by nearly 200 artisans and the renowned Atelier created by Moro Baruk. In recent years Jacmel has been host to a large film festival, called the &quot;Jacmel Film Festival&quot;, that started in 2004, and in 2007 the international &quot;Jacmel Music Festival&quot; was successfully launched as well. Its carnival, the nearby Bassin Bleu (Haiti&#x27;s most famous natural deep pools), and the scenic white sand (Timouillage, Cabic, Raymond-les-bains, located primarily in Cayes-Jacmel) beaches attract many visitors. The town is regarded as one of the safest in the country, and foreign visitors that come to Haiti seeking tranquility often go for Jacmel. Its urbanization has been increasing in large part due to the income generated by tourism. Royal Caribbean, the leading tourism company whose cruise ships regularly dock at Labadee, plans to add stopovers at Jacmel. In February 2007, Edwin Zenny became the town&#x27;s newly elected mayor. The current mayor is Marky Kessa. In addition, the Jacmel Film Festival is held there annually. On January 11, 2010, Choice Hotels announced they would open a 120-room Comfort Inn in Jacmel, the first chain hotel to be opened there in a decade.

===2010 Haiti earthquake===
On 12 January 2010, Haiti experienced a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that caused heavy damage and casualties in Jacmel. The first tremor rocked the city at 4:40 pm, but the later tremor at 5:37 pm stopped the cathedral&#x27;s clock. A Jacmel radio station estimated that at least 5000 were dead from the quake itself, although mayor Edwin &#x27;Edo&#x27; Zenny in later reported that the figure was closer to 300–500 deaths and 4,000 injured. About 70 per cent of the homes were damaged, with most of the heavier damage being in the poorer neighbourhoods. The town hall was so severely damaged that it had to be demolished. A small tsunami hit Jacmel Bay, with the ocean receding, leaving fish high and dry on the seabed, and rushing back in, four times.

====Recovery====
In December 2010, the Capponi Construction Group, a Miami-based construction company, decided to help with the revitalization of Jacmel. This initiative was created to help stimulate a self-sustaining tourism economy for Haiti. Michael Capponi, founder of the Capponi Group, formed the Jacmel Advisory Council to help revitalize Jacmel, while preserving its arts, culture and traditions. The board promotes best practices to provide a socio-economic system for thousands of Haitians living in the southeast region. Capponi Group Haiti is also restoring a 200-year-old coffee-sorting house at the port of Jacmel. The project hopes to again make Jacmel a commercial and tourist center.

== Jacmel carnival ==
The city of Jacmel is famous for its carnival which is a month long celebration culminating the week before the national Haitian carnival. The carnival of Jacmel is notable for particular costumes and masks which blends everything from Haitian folklore legends and historical figures from the country&#x27;s past to sports celebrities and political caricatures.

==Notable residents ==
* René Depestre, a famous Haitian poet and essayist who fled from the Duvalier dictatorship. He was born in Jacmel. The city is the setting for much of his fictional work.
* Préfète Duffaut – painter
* Michaëlle Jean, Secretary-General of La Francophonie and former Governor General of Canada, was born in Port-au-Prince to a Jacmel family.
* Magloire Ambroise, hero of the struggle for independence
* Jørgen Leth, Danish filmmaker, writer and former Danish honorary consul in Haiti.
*Alexandre Grégoire, painter who typically depicted scenes of Vodou, daily life, and historical events in the naïve style.

==Facilities==
The Port of Jacmel (HTJAK) is a small, relatively shallow port and is unable to harbour large ships. There is also a pleasurecraft dock as part of the port, which survived the quake. It is run by the &quot;Autorité Portuaire Nationale&quot;.

Also located in Jacmel is a small airstrip (MTJA) capable of handling small to medium-sized planes. The airstrip is unable to handle large aircraft.

Jacmel has two hospitals, &quot;Hôpital Saint-Michel&quot; and the &quot;Complexe Médico Chirurgical Rose Marie Paul&quot; recently founded by the philanthropist Dr. Leon Paul, and becomes the highest equipped surgery center in the city, with highly qualified international and national professionals. The &quot;Hôpital Saint-Michel&quot; which locals had nicknamed &quot;the morgue&quot; prior to the earthquake. The hospital is the largest hospital or health centre in the region. It has a staff of six doctors and ten nurses. The quake half-collapsed the hospital, including the maternity ward; however, the hospital continues to operate. The radiology department was the only undamaged portion of the hospital.

Jacmel had a civil court building, which was destroyed in the 2010 earthquake.

The town&#x27;s main square is Place Toussaint Louverture, named after the Haitian revolutionary leader.

<text>The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is a U.S. National Marine Sanctuary in the Florida Keys. It includes the Florida Reef, the only barrier coral reef in North America and the third-largest coral barrier reef in the world. It also has extensive mangrove forest and seagrass fields. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, designated on December 28, 1990, was the ninth national marine sanctuary to be established. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary protects approximately of coastal and ocean waters from the estuarine waters of South Florida along the Florida Keys archipelago and the Hawk Channel passage, encompassing more than 1,700 islands, out to the Dry Tortugas National Park, reaching into the Atlantic Ocean, Florida Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico.

The mission of the sanctuary is to protect the marine resources of the Florida Keys while facilitating human uses that are consistent with the primary objective of resource protection. Sanctuary waters and habitats support high species diversity due to the presence of both tropical and subtropical species, including the largest documented contiguous seagrass community in the northern hemisphere and extensive coral reef habitat. The sanctuary is also home to maritime heritage resources that encompass a broad historical period.

==Human impact==

===Population and urban development===
Population growth and urban development may impact the health of coral reefs. Development activities may cause erosion resulting in the runoff of sediments which eventually reach the coral reefs. Storm water runoff may carry fertilizers into the ocean causing damage to the coral reefs, and an increase of nutrient concentrations in the reef may cause an increase of algae which may smother the corals. Sizable foreign objects such as sunken boats and planes provide rich micro-sanctuaries for a plethora of sea life that otherwise would not exist.

===Fishing activities===
The harvest of resources from the sea is ever growing. Overfishing has changed the ecological dynamics of marine communities allowing some organisms to dominate reefs that were once controlled by large reef fish populations.

===Tourism===
Tourism dollars help to fund scientific research and environmental remediation activities. Tourism may contribute to reef damage. Divers and snorkelers may harm the corals by touching the polyps, and boats may damage it by running aground and dragging anchors.

===Coral bleaching===
Global warming coupled with an intense El Niño has led to higher sea water temperatures throughout the area, which can cause coral bleaching. &quot;Minor paling&quot; of some corals has been observed by local Coral Bleaching Early Warning Network, a program of Mote Marine Laboratory and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

==Invasive animal species==
===Lionfish===

One of the Florida Keys&#x27; most ecologically damaging invasive species is the lionfish. First discovered as an introduced species in 2009, the lionfish population affects the original flora and fauna of the Florida Keys in three major ways. The lionfish has an appetite for native fish and crustaceans and is able to spawn year-round. Originating in the Pacific Ocean, the lionfish has no known predator in the Atlantic Ocean. The lack of natural predators to control the lionfish population allows the lionfish population to grow to disruptive numbers. Lionfish are predators of juvenile fish, such as commercially important grouper and snapper, as well as juvenile parrotfish, which graze on algae in coral reefs, preventing the algae from overgrowing and killing corals. The lionfish’s dietary consumption of native species of the Florida Keys not only affects the species diversity of the Florida Keys, but also causes detriment to the environment due to a decrease in fish who help maintain the coral reefs. The regular spawning of the lionfish further impacts the environment of the Florida Keys; which therefore always maintains a stable reproductive population. A female lionfish can produce 30,000 to 40,000 eggs every few days; lionfish become sexually mature by the time they are a year old. The regular spawning of the lionfish creates a constant pressure on the Florida Keys ecosystem.

==Invasive exotic plants==

There are various introduced plants within the Florida Keys. Many of these plants outcompete the original plants of the Keys, such as mangroves and seagrass. The animals who rely on native plants for food and habitat are also at risk by invasive plants. There are four main exotic plant species that have become so invasive in the Florida Keys that they threaten and endanger 42 native plant species and 27 animal species to the point of extinction. Australian pine, Brazilian pepper or Florida holly, Asiatic colubrine, and Melaleuca all pose a risk to the flora and fauna of the Florida Keys.

===Australian pine===

The Australian pine is a nonnative species that poses risks to the original flora and fauna of the Florida Keys. The Australian pine &quot;outcompetes native vegetation by producing a dense leaf litter beneath them;&quot; therefore the Australian pine does not allow the native plants to obtain needed nutrients. The Australian pine also has a comparative advantage over native species: the Australian pine can quickly &quot;invade newly accreted beaches, beaches where dredge spoil has been deposited, and beaches where a storm has destroyed existing vegetation.&quot; The Australian pine displaces native flora of the Florida keys, and displaces native fauna by providing no native wildlife habitat.

===Brazilian pepper===

The Brazilian pepper tree is native to Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, but was brought to Florida in the mid-1800s as an ornamental plant. The introduction of the Brazilian pepper has disturbed the biodiversity of the Florida ecosystem, as one of the most widespread of the invasive non-indigenous pest plants in Florida. The Brazilian pepper tree has invaded over 700,000 acres in Florida. The tree produces a dense canopy that shades out all other plants and provides a very poor habitat for growth to native species. &quot;The Brazilian pepper invades aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats, reducing the quality of native biotic communities.&quot;

<doc id="1278087" wikidata="Q1820396" url="?curid=1278087" title="Nissan Titan">
<text>The Nissan Titan is a full-size pickup truck manufactured in the United States for the North American market by Nissan. It was named after the Titans of Greek mythology.

== First generation (A60; 2003) ==
Development of the Titan began in September 1999, with design work under Diane Allen. Giovanny Arroba&#x27;s TA60 exterior was chosen in late 2000, with a final production freeze in July 2001. The design language of the future truck was previewed by the 2001 Alpha T concept shown at the 2001 North American International Auto Show, which had previously developed through November 2000.

Production began on September 21, 2003, and sales on December 1, 2003. The Titan used Nissan&#x27;s new full-size F-Alpha platform. This new platform was shared with the Nissan Armada and Infiniti QX56 SUVs, with all three manufactured in Canton, Mississippi, United States. The first generation Titan continued without a major redesign through 2015.

===Specifications===

====Models and equipment====
All models come standard with a 32-valve, 5.6-liter engine, VK56DE, which generates ( on 2004–2007 models) and of torque. The first generation Titan came equipped with a fully boxed ladder frame and was available in either rear-wheel drive or a shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system coupled with a five-speed RE5R05A automatic transmission. An automatic brake-limited slip (ABLS) system was available on all Titans. The first generation was available as a King Cab (extended cab) or a crew cab with a full-sized back seat, with no regular cab being offered. The King Cab featured a bed, while the crew cab had a bed. In 2008, a longer wheelbase model was offered with either an bed on the King Cab or a bed on the crew cab. There were originally three trim levels available: XE, SE, and LE, each available with an Off-Road package on 4x4 models. The Pro-4X trim was introduced for the 2008 model year (4WD only). For the 2011 model year, all trim levels were updated - XE became S, SE became SV, and LE became SL, and the Pro-4X trim remained. The S was the base model, the SV a mid-level model with more features, the Pro-4X was the off-road-oriented version, and the top level SL was offered with features like 20-inch alloy wheels as standard equipment.

====Features====

Features available on the first generation included:
* Bluetooth hands-free
* Navigation system
* DVD player with screen
* Side airbags
* Pro-4X off-road package
* Traction control
* Sunroof
* Big tow package with transmission temperature gauge and telescoping mirrors
* XM Satellite Radio
* Leather split power bench seat
* Utili-Track bed rail system
* Lockable bedside storage box
* Leather-appointed heated captain&#x27;s chairs with console automatic shifter
* Rear sonar warning system
* Automatic windows down with key fob
* Power adjustable pedals
* Flex fuel
* 168-degree king cab rear door openings

====Safety====
The first generation Titan carried a five-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for driver frontal crash, and a four-star rating for passenger frontal crash.
* Vehicle dynamic control standard on 2010 models and up
* Side and front airbags standard on 2010 models and up
* Antilock brakes standard on all

=== 2008 refresh ===


== Second generation (A61; 2016) ==
The second-generation Titan was to be a lightly reskinned, rebadged version of the Dodge Ram, but those plans fell through with the 2008 worldwide financial crisis.

Nissan unveiled the second generation Titan at the 2015 North American International Auto Show. The company targeted 5 percent market share, or 100,000 annual sales in U.S. Sales reached 21,880 units in 2016.

The standard engine is a 5.6-liter V8 gasoline engine. The engine increased in power compared to the previous model, producing and of torque mated to a seven-speed automatic. Additionally, through the end of 2019, the second-generation Titan offered a Cummins 5.0-liter turbodiesel V8 that produces almost of torque. The engine is referred to as the ISV.

The second-generation Titan is available in two forms, regular and XD. The XD version is built on a heavy-duty frame based on Nissan&#x27;s commercial vehicle line and includes the Cummins diesel engine as an option. The platform is shared with the Nissan NV.

Three different cab styles are offered for the Titan and Titan XD: a two-door regular cab, four-door King (extended) Cab, and four-door crew cab. The four-door crew cab models were the first trucks to debut, followed by the King Cab and regular cab. Trim levels for the Titan and Titan XD are S, SV, Pro-4X (4X4 only), SL, and Platinum Reserve. The regular cab was only available with either S or SV trim levels, while the King Cab was only available with S, SV, or PRO-4X. The crew cab was available with all trim levels.

All Titan and Titan XD models come equipped with standard equipment such as Bluetooth for both hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, air conditioning, keyless entry, power windows and door locks, push-button ignition, and a rearview backup camera system. Options include a touchscreen audio system with GPS navigation (standard equipment for 2019), SiriusXM Satellite Radio, keyless access, an electronically-locking rear tailgate, remote start, alloy wheels, leather-trimmed seating surfaces with heating and ventilation, power front seats, a premium audio system, wood interior trim, a trailer tow package with integrated trailer brake control, and chrome front and rear bumpers and front grille.

For 2019, all Titan and Titan XD models received a new infotainment system as standard equipment, featuring GPS navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a seven-inch color touchscreen display, and the optional Rockford-Fosgate premium audio system was replaced with a new Fender premium audio system. This marks the first time a Fender audio system is available on a vehicle from a manufacturer other than Volkswagen.

=== 2020 refresh ===

For 2020, Nissan unveiled a refreshed Titan and Titan XD. For 2020, the regular cab model was dropped from both the standard and XD lines, and King Cab models of the Titan XD were no longer available. The 5.0 L Cummins turbo-diesel V8 engine that was available on the heavier-duty Titan XD was also discontinued, leaving only the 5.6 L &quot;Endurance&quot; gasoline V8. A new nine-speed Jatco automatic transmission replaced the previous seven-speed automatic transmission. New for 2020 Nissan&#x27;s V8 makes and (up from and .) The axle gear ratio on the standard Titan was also lowered from 2.93:1 ratio to 3.69:1. XD models gear ratio was lowered from 3.69:1 to a larger 4.083:1. New LED headlights were added to the front and rear of upper trims. A new optional 9-inch screen was added with high resolution as well as dual-panel panoramic moon roof. Safety upgrades include 360° safety shield standard which include lane departure warning, high-beam assist, auto emergency braking with pedestrian detection, rear auto braking, blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, traffic sign detection, and forward collision warning. Optional are intelligent cruise and intelligent driver alertness.

The Titan lineup was discontinued in Canada after the 2021 model year, citing low sales figures as the cause.

In August 2023, Nissan confirmed that the Titan will be discontinued after the 2024 model year due to poor sales compared to the mid-size Frontier. They will be exiting the full-size truck segment to focus on building EV sedans.
== Production ==
In 2019, Nissan reduced production shifts of the Nissan Titan and Frontier pickup trucks from three to two in order to match demand and adjust inventory. About 700 contract workers were affected.

<doc id="1278089" wikidata="Q3303968" url="?curid=1278089" title="British Rail APT-E">
<text>The APT-E, for Advanced Passenger Train Experimental, was the prototype Advanced Passenger Train tilting train unit. It was powered by gas turbines, the only multiple unit so powered that was used by British Rail. The APT-E consisted of two driving power cars (PC1 and 2) and two trailer cars (TC1 and 2). Each power car was equipped with four Rover-built Leyland 2S/350 gas turbines (and a fifth for auxiliary power supplies), which initially produced 300 hp each but were progressively uprated to 330 hp. Two GEC 253AY nose suspended traction motors provided the traction on the leading bogies. The vehicles were manufactured from aluminium and were approximately , with articulated bogies between them.

The APT-E made its first run on 25 July 1972 from Derby to Duffield and was immediately &#x27;blacked&#x27; by the drivers&#x27; union ASLEF, due to concerns that the single driver&#x27;s seat pre-empted ongoing negotiations about the single-manning of trains. It was over twelve months before it ran again on the main line in August 1973.

The prototype was eventually tried out on the Great Western Main Line, and achieved a new British railway speed record when on 10 August 1975 it hit whilst on test with the Western Region between Swindon and Reading. It was also tested extensively on the Midland Main Line out of London St. Pancras and on the Old Dalby Test Track, where in January 1976 it attained a speed of .

The unit was only intended for testing and was never used in ordinary public service, although it did carry office staff and the occasional dignitary on trial runs. When its period of testing was complete, in June 1976, it was sent to the National Railway Museum, York for preservation. It is now based at the NRM&#x27;s Locomotion museum in Shildon. When further APT Class 370 units were built, they were powered by 25 kV AC electrification.

==Test bed set==
The APT-POP (Power-0-Power) set was a rake of three skeletal unpowered carriages used as a test bed for the suspension, tilting and braking systems used by APT units. The &#x27;Power pumps&#x27; were only mock-ups, though similar externally to PC1 and PC2 in the APT-E unit minus cabs, and the whole set had to be hauled by a locomotive. Following the abandonment of the APT project, all three carriages were scrapped in 1985. The set was formed as follows:

*Number: RDB975634 - RDB975636 - RDB975635
*Identity: PC3 - Lab 8 - PC4

<doc id="1278092" wikidata="Q6802425" url="?curid=1278092" title="McMurry University">
<text>McMurry University is a private Methodist university in Abilene, Texas, United States. It was founded in 1923 and named after William Fletcher McMurry. The university offers forty-five majors in the fields of fine arts, humanities, social and natural sciences, education, business, and religion, and nine pre-professional programs, including nursing, dentistry, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary, and law.

In the fall of 2023, the university enrolled 2,556 students. Methodist students constitute 27 percent of the student population. Ninety five percent of students are Texan. Minority groups make up approximately one-fourth of the student body. In the freshman class, 98 percent of students receive some financial aid. Fifty-three percent of students live on campus, and 75 percent of students are involved in at least one extracurricular activity. McMurry boasts a student to faculty ratio of 13:1.

91 percent of the faculty have earned a doctorate or other terminal degree in their field. McMurry is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==History==
The college was initially founded as McMurry College on September 20, 1923. The college was established through the efforts of Methodist minister James Winfred Hunt and the Northwest Texas Conference of the Methodist Church, who initially voted to establish the school in 1920. After working with the city of Abilene to acquire the needed land, the charter of the school was ratified on November 21, 1921. Accreditation from the Texas Association of Colleges was received in 1926, the same year the school graduated its first class. 

The college gained university status in 1990, becoming McMurry University.

===Indians mascot controversy===
McMurry&#x27;s sports teams originally used Indians as their mascot. In late August 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) handed down a decision calling for the eighteen universities with Native American mascots to change their names or obtain a waiver from their representative tribe for the use of the mascot name. The McMurry Indians were part of this list. The Indians nickname was chosen as a tribute to the University&#x27;s first president, J.W. Hunt, who grew up on an Indian reservation in the Indian Territory.

On May 18, 2006, the NCAA rejected McMurry&#x27;s appeal to keep their nickname. The school chose to appeal the ruling, and indicated their intention to do so by the June 18, 2006, deadline. According to a press release, &quot;the University’s appeal will be based on the arbitrariness of the NCAA’s decision-making process and the inconsistent results and messages that have come from the process.&quot; Other schools, such as Florida State University, made successful appeals by garnering the endorsement of Indian tribes. Although McMurry did not actively seek an endorsement, representatives from the Kaw, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes voiced their approval of McMurry&#x27;s mascot. In October 2006, McMurry&#x27;s board of trustees decided that the university would no longer use any names for its athletic teams. Citing the school&#x27;s 83-year history of honoring Native Americans, the school announced that in spite of no longer using names to designate athletic teams, the school traditions created to honor Native Americans would continue. The school&#x27;s stadium name was changed from Indian Stadium to Wilford Moore Stadium as of May 13, 2007. Wilford Moore was the most-winning coach in McMurry football history.

On March 11, 2011, it was announced that McMurry University&#x27;s athletic teams would be known as the War Hawks. The new mascot was chosen after a nearly year-long search to find a new mascot to replace the former Indian mascot. The war hawk is meant to represent pride, courage and fierce competition for McMurry&#x27;s athletic teams.

==Athletics==

McMurry&#x27;s school colors are maroon and white. McMurry fields teams in 20 different intercollegiate sports. For the men, McMurry competes in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, esports, and indoor and outdoor track and field. For the women, McMurry competes in basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, esports, indoor and outdoor track and field, volleyball, in which they won the NCCAA national championship in 2012, and softball.

All teams played in the NCAA Division III American Southwest Conference until 2011. In July 2011, McMurry announced that it had been accepted as a candidate for NCAA Division II membership and joined the Heartland Conference in the fall of 2012.
The Board of Regent voted in January 2014 to move back to Division III.
The McMurry football team joined the Lone Star Conference in 2014.

McMurry University announced October 19, 2016, that the sport of softball would be added to its women&#x27;s intercollegiate programs, beginning in 2018. The addition of softball would bring to 20 the number of sports sponsored by the War Hawks. Softball sponsorship in the ASC would grow to 13 teams and becomes the seventh conference championship sport to be supported at every member institution. Women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and baseball are ASC sports sponsored by all ASC members. By conference rule and with full member sponsorship of softball, the ASC Softball Championship Tournament format would shift to eight-team double-elimination with the 2018 tournament.

===Walt Driggers Field===
Walt Driggers Field is the home of the McMurry War Hawks collegiate baseball program. The field was designed and built by Anglea Sports Fields, which is headed by former Globe Life Park in Arlington superintendent Jim Anglea. McMurry played its first game at Walt Driggers Field on February 12, 1997, with a 7–3 win against Wayland Baptist Pioneers. The school officially renamed the field before a home game against the Lubbock Christian Chaparrals shortly thereafter.

<doc id="1278102" wikidata="Q1278086" url="?curid=1278102" title="Nissan Murano">
<text>The is a mid-size crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Nissan since May 2002 for the 2003 model year. The fourth generation was revealed in October 2024.

As Nissan&#x27;s first crossover SUV for the United States and Canada, the Murano was designed at Nissan America in La Jolla, California, and was based on the Nissan FF-L platform shared with the third generation Altima. The European version of the Murano began sales in 2004.

The Murano was Nissan&#x27;s only crossover SUV in the United States until September 2007, when the Rogue went on sale. In Canada, the X-Trail had been on sale as Nissan&#x27;s second car based SUV since 2004 as a model for 2005; it was replaced by the 2008 Rogue at the end of 2007. The Murano is sized between the Pathfinder and the now defunct Xterra (which was replaced by the Rogue as a compact SUV). For the model years of 2011 to 2014, a convertible variant, the Murano CrossCabriolet, was available for the second-generation model. As of 2018, the Murano is sized between the X-Trail and the larger Pathfinder.

The nameplate &quot;Murano&quot; derives from the Italian islands of Murano and the namesake Murano art glass for which the islands are widely known.


== First generation (Z50; 2002)==

The first generation Nissan Murano was unveiled in production form for the model year of 2003, at the 2002 New York International Auto Show. It is powered by a 3.5-liter (&quot;VQ35DE&quot;) V6 producing and , also used in several other Nissan models like the Altima, Maxima, and Nissan 350Z, but specifically tuned for use in the Murano. Available with standard front-wheel-drive (FWD) and optional all-wheel-drive (AWD), the Nissan Murano is one of the largest vehicles using a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Fuel economy was rated at in the city and on the highway (same mpg FWD and AWD on the new EPA specifications). 

Production started in the middle of May 2002, and the first vehicles shipped in early June for the United States and mid-July for Canadian markets. Sales in Europe started in 2004, following its European premiere at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show. An independent suspension on all wheels was used for class-leading ride and handling.

A full set of airbags, steel-reinforced cabin, and head restraints were safety features designed to protect the interior while VDC, ABS, electronic brakeforce distribution and brake assist were mechanical safety features. VDC incorporates a form of traction control.

The Murano received a crash test rating of five stars in all categories but vehicle rollover (four stars) from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

For the model year of 2006 in North America, the Murano received some updates in the form of LED tail lamps and turn signals, standard color information screen, available backup camera (standard in Canada for all models), GPS and a restyled front end with some minor trim updates. September 2004, the Murano was introduced in Japan, replacing the Bassara MPV and exclusive to &quot;Nissan Red Stage&quot; locations, with a further introduction at &quot;Nissan Blue Stage&quot; locations in October, replacing the Terrano.

In Japan, the Murano is equipped with many optional features found in North America as standard equipment on Japanese models, including Nissan&#x27;s GPS and internet-based navigation system called CarWings. Japanese models were available with two engine choices, the 3.5L V6 engine mated to a CVT transmission or a 2.5 L four-cylinder engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

=== Murano GT-C ===
Nissan’s Cranfield-based Technical Centre Europe produced a concept of the Murano called the Murano GT-C. The purpose was to gauge consumer interest in a low-volume performance-orientated version of the first generation Murano. The concept featured a raft of performance upgrades over the standard Murano including bigger brakes, revised suspension, exterior styling and a Garret turbocharager that increased power from . This enabled the GT-C to achieve a 0 to of 7 seconds, with a top speed of slightly over .

== Second generation (Z51; 2007)==

The 2008 Murano made its debut at the 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show in November, and sales began in January 2008. The exterior and interior were redesigned.

The second generation Murano was initially offered in three trim levels: the base S, the mid grade SL, and the top level LE (Luxury Edition). The performance oriented SE model was discontinued. The S and SL are offered with standard FWD, with optional iAWD (Intelligent All Wheel Drive) available. The LE trim is iAWD only.

The second generation Murano included new features, some of which were optional or available only on the LE grade, including rain sensing wipers, double stitched leather seats, power rear lift gate, power fold up rear seats, iPod integration, and a hard-drive based, touchscreen navigation system. The S and SL feature aluminum interior accents, while the LE sports wood tone trim. Like the first generation model, there is no third row seat.

The second generation is based on the Nissan D platform, shared with the L32 Altima and the A35 Maxima. The second generation was equipped a revised version of the 3.5 L VQ engine rated at , an increase of 20 over the previous model. Torque is rated at . The engine is mated to a revised Continuously Variable Transmission with Adaptive Shift Control. The United States EPA fuel economy rating is city highway.

Standard safety features on all trims include four wheel disc brakes with ABS, brake assist, and EBD; electronic stability control; and front, side, and side curtain airbags. The NHTSA awarded the second generation Murano four stars on the frontal crash test, and five stars for side impacts, worse than the first generation.

On September 29, 2008, Nissan released the second generation Murano in Japan, targeted mainly at men in their 30s, 40s and 50s. Nissan announced plans to sell the vehicle in 170 countries. The four-cylinder 2.5L QR engine continued to be offered as an option in Japan.

In July 2010, Nissan launched a facelifted version in Europe only, with an updated 2.5-litre &quot;YD25DDTi&quot; four cylinder diesel engine producing and .

For the model year of 2011, the Murano was refreshed to include refreshed front and rear fascias, new headlights and LED taillights, and new 18 inch wheels on the outside. New interior changes included a new white meter color (as opposed to red/orange), new center stack plastic colors matching the leather trim, and added equipment to various trim levels. The refresh also added a new exterior color, &quot;Graphite Blue&quot; and for the 2013 model year the LE trim was renamed to Platinum.

In September 2011, Nissan launched the second-generation Murano in Indonesia. In April 2011, the Murano was officially withdrawn from the United Kingdom, due to disappointing sales.

===Murano CrossCabriolet===
Nissan premiered the Murano CrossCabriolet at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show, marketing it as &quot;the world’s first all wheel drive crossover convertible.&quot;

Nissan began formally marketing the CrossCabriolet with the model year of 2011 — without further refreshes or any other trim levels during its production run. The crossover was only offered in the LE trim and had the same engine as a standard Murano.

The fully automatic, hydraulically operated cloth top has an automatic power latch/unlatch system, rear glass skylight, dual pop-up roll bars, cf cargo capacity with the top down and with the top up — and a Cd of 0.39. Its front doors are longer than four door Murano front doors, with structural reinforcement from the A-pillar rearward.

The Murano CrossCabriolet was discontinued after the 2014 model year.

== Third generation (Z52; 2014)==


In April 2014, Nissan unveiled the third generation Murano at the New York International Auto Show, with production in Canton, Mississippi and featuring the VQ-Series 3.5-liter V6 which produces up to .

The third-generation Murano is not marketed in Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as it is not produced in right-hand drive. The nameplate was discontinued there due to sluggish sales, with the more compact X-Trail taking its place.

The Nissan Murano made a return in Mexico after an absence for a decade after the second generation was discontinued in that market on April 11, 2018, as a 2019 model. For the Mexican market, it is offered only in the Advance and Exclusive trim lines and only offered in a V6 3.5-liter engine.

For the 2019 model year, Murano received an updated front and rear fascias as well as a new wheel design and quilted semi-aniline leather appointed seating became standard on the Platinum trim level and also gets new interior trim finishers, Light wood-tone on SV and SL trim levels with cashmere interior, Metallic trim on S, SV, and SL trim levels with graphite interior, and Dark wood-tone on the Platinum trim level. New exterior colors include Deep Blue Pearl, Mocha Almond Pearl, and Sunset Drift ChromaFlair.

For 2020, it kept the same design while receiving minimal changes, mostly safety features. The SV and SL models received the Nissan Safety Shield 360 as standard, which included automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, rear automatic braking, and high-beam assist. It was facelifted in February 2020 for Mexico, dropping the Advance trim line and being only offered in the Platinum AWD trim line.

Since 2020, Murano production in North America shifted from Canton, Mississippi to the Nissan Smyrna Assembly Plant in Tennessee.

For 2021, Nissan&#x27;s &quot;Safety Shield 360&quot; became standard on all Murano trim levels. A Special Edition package was offered on the SV trim level with 20-inch dark charcoal wheels, leatherette seats, special badging, heated front seats, and a dual panel panoramic moonroof.

===Murano Hybrid===
For the model year of 2016, Nissan introduced a hybrid version of the Murano. The Murano Hybrid was available in two trim levels, SL and Platinum. The Murano Hybrid features an electric motor, a 2.5-liter four cylinder engine, Intelligent Dual Clutch System, and a lithium-ion battery that is located under the center console. Hybrid components does not reduce passenger and cargo space. The hybrid version uses the so-called VSP (Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians) system that uses sound to help alert pedestrians of the presence of the vehicle, when it is being driven at a low speed in the electric drive mode.

=== Markets ===

==== North America ====
For 2022, a Midnight Edition appearance package replaced the Special Edition package for the SV trim, featuring a black grille, exterior trim pieces, and black painted 20-inch aluminum alloy wheels.

For 2023, two new exterior paint colors were added: Super Black and Deep Ocean Blue Pearl.

For 2024, the base S trim was dropped, making the SV trim the entry grade.

The updated US-made Murano in its most basic Latin American market configuration with 7 airbags received 5 stars for adult occupants and 3 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2017 (obsolete protocol).

== Fourth generation (Z53; 2025) ==

The fourth-generation Murano was unveiled on 16 October 2024. The updated model bears a strong resemblance to the Nissan Ariya electric crossover, and incorporates many modern features that were not previously available on the Murano, including ventilated and massaging front seats, dual 12.3-inch instrument cluster and infotainment displays, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, Nissan ProPilot Assist 1.0 and 1.1, and a color heads-up display. 

The powertrain consisting of a 3.5-litre Nissan VQ35DE V6 engine and a continuously variable transmission used on all previous generations of the Murano has been replaced with a 2.0-litre turbocharged Nissan KR20DDET engine with variable compression technology, shared with the Nissan Altima and Infiniti QX50. It is the first Nissan model to pair this engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Intended for the North American market, the 2025 Murano will be available in SV, SL, and Platinum trim levels.

<text>The Arunachal macaque (Macaca munzala) is a macaque native to Eastern Himalayas of Bhutan, China and India. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. 

It was scientifically described in 2005.

It is a relatively large brown primate with a comparatively short tail.
Its species name comes from &quot;mun zala&quot;, meaning deep forest (&quot;mun&quot;) monkey (&quot;monkey&quot;), as it is called by the Monpa people of West Kameng and Tawang.

==Discovery==

It was discovered as a new taxon in 1997 by the Indian primatologist Anwaruddin Choudhury, but he thought it to be a new subspecies of the Tibetan macaque (&quot;M. thibetana&quot;). It was described as a new species in 2005 by a group of scientists from the Nature Conservation Foundation, India. It is the first species of macaque to have been discovered since 1903, when the Indonesian Pagai Island macaque was discovered. This monkey was reported on the basis of a good quality photograph as the holotype. In 2011, some researchers suggested, on the basis of morphological variation within the Assamese macaque, that it might be better treated as a subspecies.

Subsequently, it was also discovered in Bhutan, where it was observed and photographed in the Trashi Yangshi area in 2006.

==Description==
The Arunachal macaque is compactly built and has a very dark face. It lives at high altitudes, between 2000 m and 3500 m above sea level, making it one of the highest-dwelling primates. It belongs to the &quot;M. sinica&quot; species-group of macaques, along with the Assamese macaque (&quot;M. assamensis&quot;), the Tibetan macaque, the bonnet macaque (&quot;M. radiata&quot;) and the toque macaque (&quot;M. sinica&quot;).

The Arunachal macaque is apparently physically similar to the Assam and Tibetan macaques, while genetically closely related to the bonnet macaque of southern India. This is probably the result of convergent evolution, where organisms evolve similar physical features due to similar environmental selection pressure, while genetically they may have different origins.

Kumar et al. (2008) and Sinha et al. (2006) report at least 569 individuals in thirty-five troops; thirty-two troops in Tawang and three troops in West Kameng. The monkey is severely persecuted in some parts of its known distribution by locals retaliating against crop raiding.

<text>British Rail&#x27;s Class 370 tilting trains, also referred to as APT-P (meaning Advanced Passenger Train Prototype), were the pre-production Advanced Passenger Train units. Unlike the earlier experimental gas-turbine [[British Rail APT-E|APT-E]] unit, these units were electric multiple unit sets, powered by 25 kV AC overhead electrification and were used on the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Glasgow Central. The train had eight traction motors fitted to the two central motor cars giving a total output of , which enabled it to set the UK rail speed record of in December 1979, a record that stood for 23years until broken by a Eurostar Class 373 on the newly completed High Speed 1 line.

==History==
The APT-P was unveiled to the public on 7 June 1978 and continued to be used for testing into 1986. Due to ongoing technical problems with these pre-production units, and a lack of cash or political will to take the project forward, the planned APT-S (Advanced Passenger Train Squadron Service) production-series units were never built, but did influence the design of the later InterCity 225 sets designed for the East Coast Main Line electrification. The influence is strongest with the Class 91 locos which took many features from the APT power cars. The technology was later sold to Fiat Ferroviaria and used for improving their second generation Pendolino trains which are used worldwide, including on the West Coast Main Line as the Class 390.

===Numbering===
Units were numbered 370001-370006 (plus two spare cars labelled 370007) and were formed as follows:
*48101-48107 - Driving Trailer Second
*48201-48206 - Trailer Second
*48401-48406 - Trailer Restaurant Second Buffet
*48301-48306 - Trailer Unclassified
*48501-48506 - Trailer First
*48601-48607 - Trailer Brake First
*49001-49006 - Non-Driving Motor

A full train was made up of two units running back-to-back, with the two motor cars adjoining. The motor cars had no seating accommodation or through-gangway, so the two halves of the train were unconnected for passengers.

===Withdrawal and preservation===
All six units were withdrawn during 1985–1986, and most cars were quickly scrapped. The remaining cars are exhibited at Crewe Heritage Centre, a museum located next to Crewe station.
* Of these, six cars are formed into a single train: 
**48103 - Driving Trailer Second
**48404 - Trailer Restaurant Second Buffet
**48603 - Trailer Brake First
**49002 - Non-Driving Motor
**48602 - Trailer Brake First
**48106 - Driving Trailer Second
* A single Non-Driving Motor car does not form part of the train and is exhibited separately:
**49006 - Non-Driving Motor (not part of the above train) was on loan to the Electric Railway Museum in Coventry from July 2011 until its closure in October 2017 and moved back to Crewe Heritage Centre in March 2018.

== Models ==
In 1980, Hornby Railways produced a OO gauge five-car set model available as a train set with plain yellow fronts, which was released as a five-car train pack with black fronts and window surrounds in 1981, until appearing in the 1983 catalogue when the train set was last produced. In 1984 it was discontinued from the Hornby range. However, it was featured in the 1985 catalogue, although no new models were produced that year.

In 2020, Hornby Railways announced that as part of their centenary year range - and both the 40th anniversaries of the year it entered service and the original Hornby model a newly tooled OO gauge model of the BR Class 370 Advanced Passenger Train would be launched.
The APT-P will be available as part of a five-car train pack consisting of sets 370 003 and 370 004 with plain yellow fronts included are DTS, TFB, NDM (motorised), TFB and DTS and a seven-car train pack included is the APT U Development coach, consisting of sets 370 001 and 370 002 with DTS, TBF, NDM (motorised), NDM (dummy), TBF and DTS in APT livery with black front and window surrounds with the additional SKU&#x27; coaches available separately in four sets of two including TS, TU, TRBS, and TF with the additional NDM (motorised) and the APT U Development coach,(for the five-car pack) for each set to form a realistic complete full rake train for both train packs.

<doc id="1278119" wikidata="Q26667" url="?curid=1278119" title="Brunello di Montalcino">
<text>Brunello di Montalcino is a red DOCG Italian wine produced in the vineyards surrounding the town of Montalcino, in the province of Siena, located about 80 km south of Florence, in the Tuscan wine region. Brunello, a diminutive of &quot;bruno&quot; (), is the name that was given locally to what was believed to be an individual grape variety grown in Montalcino. In 1879 the province of Siena&#x27;s Amphelographic Commission determined, after a few years of controlled experiments, that Sangiovese and Brunello were the same grape variety, and that the former should be its designated name. In Montalcino the name Brunello evolved into the designation of the wine produced with 100% Sangiovese.

In 1980, Brunello di Montalcino was among the four wines awarded the first &quot;denominazione di origine controllata e garantita&quot; (DOCG) designation. Today it is one of Italy&#x27;s best-known and most expensive wines.

==History==

One of the first records of &quot;Brunello&quot; was a red wine that was made in the Montalcino area in the early 14th century. In 1831, &quot;marchese&quot; Cosimo Ridolfi (who was later appointed Prime Minister of Tuscany by the Grand Duke Leopold II) praised the merits of the red wines of Montalcino above all others in Tuscany. In 1865, an agricultural fair in Montalcino noted that the prize winning wine of the event was a &quot;select red wine&quot; known as a Brunello. In the mid-19th century, a local farmer named Clemente Santi isolated certain plantings of Sangiovese vines in order to produce a 100% varietal wine that could be aged for a considerable period of time. In 1888, his grandson Ferruccio Biondi-Santi—a veteran soldier who fought under Giuseppe Garibaldi during the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;—released the first &quot;modern version&quot; of &quot;Brunello di Montalcino&quot; that was aged for over a decade in large wood barrels.

By the end of World War II, Brunello di Montalcino had developed a reputation as one of Italy&#x27;s rarest wines. The only commercial producer recorded in government documents was the Biondi-Santi firm, which had declared only four vintages up to that point—1888, 1891, 1925, and 1945. The high price and prestige of these wines soon encouraged other producers to emulate Biondi-Santi&#x27;s success. By the 1960s there were 11 producers making Brunello, and in 1968 the region was granted &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) status. By 1970 the number of producers had more than doubled to 25, and by 1980 there were 53 producers. In 1980, the Montalcino region was the first Italian wine region to be awarded &quot;denominazione di origine controllata e garantita&quot; (DOCG) designation. By the turn of the 21st century, there were nearly 200 producers of Brunello di Montalcino, mostly small farmers and family estates, together producing nearly 330,000 cases a year.

In 2008, Italian authorities confiscated four producers&#x27; 2003 Brunello on charges that the producers had committed fraud by including foreign varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the wine that they then fraudulently labeled as Brunello di Montalcino, which by law may only contain Sangiovese grapes. Laboratory tests later confirmed that the confiscated wines were in fact Brunello except for a small portion that remained inconclusive.

==Climate and geography==
Montalcino has one of the warmest and driest climates in Tuscany with the grapes in the area ripening up to a week earlier than in nearby Montepulciano. It is the most arid Tuscan DOCG, receiving an average annual rainfall of around 700 mm, in contrast to the Chianti region which receives an average of 900 mm. As with all of the Northern Hemisphere, the north-facing slopes receive fewer hours of sunlight and are generally cooler than the south-facing slopes. Thus, vineyards planted on the north-facing slopes ripen more slowly and tend to produce wines that are racier and more aromatic. Vineyards on the southern and western slopes receive more intense exposure to sunlight and more maritime winds which produces wines with more power and complexity. The top producers in the area have vineyards on both slopes, and make use of a blend of both styles.

The town of Montalcino is a small medieval village located about above sea level in the province of Siena. The wine district is centered to the northeast of the village in densely wooded and hilly terrain. Monte Amiata, the highest peak in Southern Tuscany, provides a sheltering influence from the southeast and tempers the region&#x27;s climate and rainfall. Compared to the nearly of planted land in Chianti, Montalcino is a relatively small wine region with around planted. Vineyards in Montalcino are planted in varied soils—including limestone, clay, schist, volcanic soil and a crumbly marl known as &quot;galestro&quot;—at altitudes ranging from 149 m to 500 m. This diversity in &quot;terroir&quot; contributes to the vast range in quality and potential complexity of Brunello di Montalcino.

According to Kerin O&#x27;Keefe, &quot;Although sangiovese excels in select parts of Montalcino, it does not perform as well throughout the whole denomination thanks to the dramatic differences within the large growing area.&quot; O&#x27;Keefe is in favor of putting subzones on the labels as this would greatly help consumers understand the stark differences among Brunellos from Montalcino&#x27;s greatly varied territory, proposing 8 subzones: Montalcino North, Montalcino South, Castelnuovo dell&#x27;Abate, Camigliano, Tavernelle, Bosco, Torrenieri, Sant&#x27;Angelo.

==Winemaking and regulations==

Brunello di Montalcino is made 100% from Sangiovese. Traditionally, the wine goes through an extended maceration period, where color and flavor are extracted from the skins. Following fermentation, the wine is then aged in oak. Traditionally, the wines are aged 3 years or more &quot;in botte&quot;—large Slavonian oak casks that impart little oak flavor and generally produce more austere wines. Some winemakers will use small French barrique which impart a more pronounced vanilla oak flavor. There is a middle ground where the wine is aged in small barrique for a short time and then spends a longer sojourn in the traditional botte.

Most producers will separate their production between a &quot;Normale&quot; and &quot;Riserva&quot; bottling. The &quot;Normale&quot; bottles are released on the market 50 months after harvest and the &quot;Riserva&quot; are released a year afterward. The current aging requirements were established in 1998 and dictate that Brunellos are to be aged in oak for 2 years and at least 4 months in a bottle before release. Winemakers who intentionally stray from these rules and regulations can possibly receive a conviction of commercial fraud accompanied by an imprisonment sentence of up to six years.

===&quot;Brunellopoli&quot;===

In 2008, reports surfaced that Italian authorities were investigating claims that several major Brunello producers were adulterating their wines by using foreign or domestic grape varieties in violation of the DOCG regulations, which stipulate that only Sangiovese may be used to make Brunello. The prosecutor handling the investigation said he would bring commercial fraud charges that could result in imprisonment for the violators. The producers in question were suspected of adding wine made from non-approved grapes in order to make it more appealing to the international market. In response the U.S. government blocked imports of Brunello that did not have proof that they were in fact 100% Sangiovese. The scandal was coined &quot;Brunellopoli&quot; by the Italian wine press.

==Grapes and wines==

The Sangiovese grape is the most widely planted grape in the Montalcino region and is the only permitted grape in the Brunello di Montalcino DOCG. The particular clones of Sangiovese are unique to the Montalcino region and have developed in adaption to that area&#x27;s specific &quot;terroir&quot;. The altitude and climate of the Montalcino region has provided an area where Sangiovese ripens more fully and consistently than anywhere else in Tuscany. These factors contribute to the body, color, extract and tannins commonly associated with Brunello di Montalcino. In contrast to Chianti, the other famous Sangiovese based wine of Tuscany, Brunello di Montalcinos have a more fleshy texture with common aromas and flavors of blackberry, black cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, leather and violets.

Brunello is often compared with the Pinot noir wines of Burgundy with its smooth tannins and ripe, fruit driven character. The high acidity of the wine allows it to pair well with food, especially grilled meat and game. A large portion of Brunello sold in the United States is purchased in restaurants. The wine has become particularly popular in America with nearly 1 out of every 3 bottles of Brunello di Montalcino being sold in the US. Brunello di Montalcino are known for their ability to age with well made examples from exceptional vintages often showcasing development for several decades. Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan notes that most Brunellos often need at least 10 years before they shed their youthfulness and start to harmonize their flavors.

==Other wines==
In addition to Brunello di Montalcino, producers in the Montalcino region can produce wine under Rosso di Montalcino, Sant&#x27;Antimo and Moscadello di Montalcino DOCs as well as the generic &quot;indicazione geografica tipica&quot; designation of Toscana IGT. Moscadello di Montalcino is a sweet white wine made from Muscat. The style was once widely produced in Montalcino but fell out of style following World War II. In the early 1980s, the wine estate of Castello Banfi attempted to revive the style by planting Muscat. The Sant&#x27;Antimo DOC was named for the 9th century abbey built by Charlemagne. In the 1970s, producers in Montalcino were influenced by the success of the &quot;Super Tuscan&quot; style of wine that was gaining international recognition for Chianti producers who deviated from DOC regulations with winemaking techniques such blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese. In 1996, Italian authorities approved the Sant&#x27;Antimo DOC to allow Montalcino producers to produce DOC designated wines that were not 100% Sangiovese. These wines include blended &quot;Bianco&quot; and &quot;Rosso&quot; wines as well as varietally labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot grigio, Pinot noir and Sauvignon blanc.

===Rosso di Montalcino===

The Rosso di Montalcino DOC was established in 1984 as a means of giving Brunello di Montalcino producers the flexibility to continue the tradition of long aging of the region&#x27;s flagship wine. Rosso di Montalcino is made from 100% Sangiovese grown in the same delineated region as Brunello di Montalcino. However, the wine is required to spend only six months aging in oak and 1 year total aging before release. This allows Brunello producers to make an earlier releasing wine that can generate cash flow while their Brunello di Montalcino age for their complete duration. In less than ideal vintages some producers will relegate all their grapes to Rosso di Montalcino production and not make a Brunello. Wineries can also declassify their Brunello that has already been aging 2–3 years and release it as Rosso di Montalcino if the wine is not developing to their expectations. Rosso di Montalcino is typically lighter, fresher and more approachable upon release though some producers will make wines with more Brunello like characteristics. These &quot;Baby Brunellos&quot; are often 1/3 to 1/2 the price of Brunello di Montalcino.

<doc id="1278124" wikidata="Q1512971" url="?curid=1278124" title="Toyota Sequoia">
<text>The Toyota Sequoia is a full-size SUV manufactured by Toyota mainly for the North American market since 2000 for the 2001 model year, being derived from the Tundra pickup truck. It is the second largest SUV ever produced under the Toyota brand, after the Japan-exclusive, military-focused Mega Cruiser.

Previously manufactured at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana in Princeton, Indiana between 2000 and 2021, and then in Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas in San Antonio, Texas since 2022, the Sequoia is the first vehicle from a Japanese marque in the popular mainstream full-sized SUV class in North America, and initial planning done by first-generation Sequoia chief engineer Kaoru Hosokawa aimed the Sequoia directly at the Ford Expedition, Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon, and other full-size SUVs.

Up until the 2021 model year, the Sequoia was slotted between the mid-size 4Runner and the premium Land Cruiser in the North American Toyota SUV lineup. With the discontinuation of North American sales of the Land Cruiser from the 2022 model year onward, the Sequoia became the flagship SUV in Toyota&#x27;s North America lineup.

, the Sequoia is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Costa Rica. It is offered in left-hand drive only.

The Sequoia is named after the Giant Sequoia, a species of tall redwood trees native to California.


== First generation (XK30/XK40; 2000) ==

Development of a full-size SUV alongside a T100 replacement began in the mid-1990s, with a design freeze in 1997 (styled by Toshihiko Shirasawa) and design patent filing of the production design on April 4, 1998 at the Japan Patent Office (JPO) under #1054583. After the introduction of the Toyota Tundra in 1999, speculation started that Toyota intended to compete in the full-size SUV market with a Tundra-based SUV called the Highlander. However, the Highlander name was used on a mid-size Camry-based crossover and the Tundra-based SUV was introduced on January 11, 2000 at the North American International Auto Show as the Toyota Sequoia, with full production starting in September 2000 for the 2001 model year.

The engine, dashboard, sheetmetal, and chassis are shared with the Tundra, with the exception of rear disc brakes and a more sophisticated multi-link live axle rear suspension. The Sequoia was nominated for the &quot;North American Truck of the Year&quot; award in 2001. When the Sequoia was introduced, it was slightly longer than the contemporary Land Cruiser, larger than the Chevrolet Tahoe in most dimensions and similar in size to the Ford Expedition; its low emissions V8 engine made the Sequoia a certified Ultra Low Emission Vehicle. Frame assemblies and driveshafts are produced by Dana Holding Corporation.

The Sequoia came in two trim levels: &quot;SR5&quot; and &quot;Limited&quot;. It was sold in both two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive versions. Vehicle Stability Control was standard on all models.

===Facelift===
For the 2005 model year, the Sequoia received a minor facelift. Additionally, its 2UZ-FE engine was modified to be equipped with VVT-i. The Sequoia also received a new 5-speed automatic transmission, replacing the previous 4-speed. 4 wheel drive models got a Torsen center differential, replacing its previously open differential, that splits power in full-time mode 40% front and 60% rear under normal driving, and can send up to 53% to the front and 71% to the rear during slip. The grill and headlights were redesigned and the amber lamps were removed from the taillights. 

Towing Capacity for the 2005 model year:
*2WD: 
*4WD: 

== Second generation (XK60; 2007) ==

Toyota unveiled the 2008 Sequoia at the November 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show, with sales beginning that following December. Like the original Sequoia, the new model is based on the new Tundra. However major differences with the Tundra include a fully boxed frame, a rear independent suspension featuring double wishbones with coil springs for improved ride comfort and room, and a locking center differential on 4-wheel drive models. The new suspension helps give the Sequoia a tighter turning radius of and allows for a fold-flat rear seat. Toyota stated the new frame is 70 percent more resistant to bending flex with torsional rigidity up 30 percent. However, the new model weighs more than the previous Sequoia. The drag coefficient has been reduced to 0.35.

Improvements include an optional ULEV-II compliant 381 horsepower 5.7 L &quot;3UR-FE&quot; V8, mated to a 6-speed automatic.

The 2008 Sequoia came in three trim lines: the SR5 and Limited, and new Platinum. The base engine is the previous ULEV compliant 4.7 L &quot;2UZ-FE&quot; V8 featured from the previous generation. The 4.7 L is standard on the SR5. Some of the earlier 2008 and 2009 SR5 models do come with the 5.7 L as an option when purchasing, while the Limited and Platinum models come standard with a 5.7 L V8 engine. Four-wheel drive is available on all models.

The interior of the 2008 Sequoia features the same dash as the new Tundra. Standard features include a tilt and telescopic steering wheel, power windows and doors, dual sun visors, and a keyless entry. Options include DVD based navigation with backup camera and 7&quot; screen, a rear DVD entertainment system, a 14-speaker JBL audio system, and heated seats with ventilated coolers in the front row and warmers in the second row, available in Platinum trim. The Limited trim includes audio, climate, and hands-free Bluetooth mobile phone system controls, an improved JBL audio system, electroluminescent Optitron gauges, and an electrochromic auto-dimming rear-view mirror and side view mirrors with a HomeLink transceiver. The Platinum model includes a standard DVD navigation with a backup camera, a rear air suspension which can lower for easy loading, and Dynamic Laser Cruise Control.

Seating arrangements are for seven or eight passengers, eight for SR5 and Limited models and seven for Platinum models. Power folding 60/40 split third row seats are available on the Platinum. The Sequoia has a maximum towing capacity of with the 5.7 L V8 in 2WD SR5 form or in the 4WD SR5 trim. For complete trailer &amp; weight capacities, see Toyota&#x27;s website.

Exterior differences include door handle colors (color-keyed for the SR5; chrome for the Limited and Platinum), diamond-cut aluminum alloy wheels for the Platinum trim, and varying power-heated remote-controlled side mirrors.

===Engines===
===Safety===
Standard safety features include Vehicle Stability Control, traction control, anti-lock brakes brake assist, electronic brakeforce distribution, front side torso airbags and roll-sensing side curtain airbags for all three rows. For the 2010 model knee airbags were added as standard feature for front driver and passenger safety.

In 2015, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found the Sequoia 4WD to have the lowest overall driver death rate in its class with 0 deaths per million registered vehicle years.

===Model year changes===
*The 2009 model year adds E85 flex fuel capability for the 5.7 L V8 sold in certain states.
*For the 2010 model year the 4.7 L V8 is replaced by an all-new 4.6 L &quot;1UR-FE&quot; engine paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. The SR5 and Platinum trims become mono-spec and the Limited grade offers three stand alone options (navigation system, rear-seat entertainment and seven-passenger seating). Front driver and passenger knee airbags were added as a standard feature. Platinum models get wood trim on the steering wheel and shift gear, and Bluetooth and audio controls are standard on the SR5 trim. The Timberland Mica exterior color gets replaced with the new Camry&#x27;s Spruce Mica. All audio systems have USB connectivity with iPod integration, and the rear-view mirror on the Limited trim has a built-in rear-view camera.
*For the 2012 model year, Toyota&#x27;s Entune System was added as a standard on SR5, while an upgraded version featuring navigation became an optional feature on Limited and standard on the Platinum trim. Blind Spot Monitoring was optional on the 2012 Platinum model.
*For the 2014 model year, a Blu-ray DVD player became an optional feature on Limited and standard in Platinum.
*No major changes were made for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 model years.
*On February 9, 2017, Toyota unveiled a refreshed Sequoia for the 2018 model year, featuring new standard LED headlights, daytime running lights and foglights, and three new exterior colors: Midnight Black Metallic, Shoreline Blue Pearl and Toasted Walnut Pearl. Each trim level also gets its own specific grille design. It also added a TRD level trim to its returning SR5, Limited, and Platinum trims, an upgraded instrumentation panel, automotive emergency braking and the Toyota Safety Sense feature.
*The 2020 model year Sequoia was updated with a new TRD Pro package designed for off-road capabilities, featuring Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Toyota Safety Sense-P, aluminum-bodied internal bypass Fox shock absorbers, and a more enhanced grille in line with the TRD Pro branding. Toyota Safety Sense-P includes forward collision warning with automatic braking, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.
*The 2021 Sequoia received a Nightshade Edition, putting it in line with the entire Toyota lineup in North America. This feature, which was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show on February 6, 2020, went on sale in the third quarter of 2020, but was limited to at 2,500 units.

===Accolades===
*In a 2008 Motor Trend comparison between several full-size SUVs, the Sequoia took first place.

*The Sequoia is the top vehicle in the US that is most likely to last 200,000 miles according to a 2019 study from iSeeCars.

== Third generation (XK80; 2022) ==

The third-generation Sequoia was unveiled on January 25, 2022 for the 2023 model year. Production began on September 21, 2022, and sales began in October 2022. The production was moved to the San Antonio plant, built alongside the XK70 series Tundra due to the Indiana facility preparing to build two upcoming 8-seat passenger SUVs that will feature hybrid powertrains.

It is built on the body-on-frame GA-F platform. Like the first generation, this generation uses a solid rear axle instead of independent setup from the previous generation. A hybrid &quot;&quot; twin-turbo V6 engine (marketed as &quot;i-Force Max&quot;) is standard across the lineup, producing and of torque, with the 5.7-liter &quot;3UR-FE&quot; V8 unit being discontinued.

The third-generation Sequoia is available in five trim levels, four of which are carried over from the previous generation: SR5, Limited, Platinum, and TRD Pro, as well as the flagship Capstone luxury-oriented trim. Towing capacity is rated at , depending on the trim level. Depending on trims, the Sequoia is available with either a seven or eight passenger seating, with either a split bench or dual captain&#x27;s chairs in the second row.

===Model year changes:===

==== 2024: ====

* A new &quot;Terra&quot; color became available only for the TRD Pro trim.
* The Limited trim became available with the Nightshade package.
* The Platinum trim became available with the TRD Off-Road package. 

==== 2025: ====

* A new &quot;Mudbath&quot; color was available only for the TRD Pro trim.
* A towing technology package was introduced as a standard feature on Platinum, 1794 Edition, TRD Pro, and Capstone and as an option on SR5 and Limited. This package includes a Trailer Backup Guide to assist in backing up with a trailer attached and Straight Path Assist to avoid the trailer from veering off direction while backing up. Also available is a wireless trailer camera system that can be attached to the back of a trailer and stream live footage to the digital rear view mirror.
* Massaging seats were added as a standard feature on the Platinum, 1794 Edition, and Capstone trims. The massagers can be controlled via the center touchscreen.
* The Western-oriented &quot;1794 Edition&quot; trim was added to the Sequoia lineup between the Platinum and Capstone trims. It is a tribute to the land the factory was built on, which was originally home to a ranch established in the year 1794. Standard features include American walnut interior trim with an open-pore finish, Saddle Tan leather seat trim, heated and ventilated front seats and second-row captain chairs, a panoramic sunroof, a towing technology package, and 20-inch alloy wheels.

==Recall==
The 2008-2010 Sequoias were part of one of the 2009-2010 Toyota recalls that required the installation of a small shim to relieve unwanted friction and restore fluidity to the accelerator pedal. Early 2003 Sequoias were recalled to reprogram the Vehicle Stability Control system due to the possibility of poor acceleration at certain low speeds. The 2002-2003 Sequoia model years also had a defect in the front ball joints. 2004 Toyota Sequoias were subject to the Takata Airbag recall done for free by Toyota dealerships. Recently, the Sequoia, along with the Tacoma and Tundra, have another recall due to the frame prematurely rusting. If there is a 10 mm perforation found on the frame, the vehicle frame will be replaced, if the service is done within 12 years of vehicle purchase or 1 year after recall became official. For those vehicles without 10 mm perforation and located in a cold weather state, Toyota will perform an undercoating service to prevent future rust from forming.

<doc id="1278130" wikidata="Q7998256" url="?curid=1278130" title="Wickard v. Filburn">
<text>Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that dramatically increased the regulatory power of the federal government. It remains as one of the most important and far-reaching cases concerning the New Deal, and it set a precedent for an expansive reading of the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Commerce Clause for decades to come. The goal of the legal challenge was to end the entire federal crop support program by declaring it unconstitutional.

An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The U.S. government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone &quot;interstate&quot; commerce (described in the Constitution as &quot;Commerce ... among the several states&quot;). The Supreme Court disagreed: &quot;Whether the subject of the regulation in question was &#x27;production&#x27;, &#x27;consumption&#x27;, or &#x27;marketing&#x27; is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power before us. ... But even if appellee&#x27;s activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as &#x27;direct&#x27; or &#x27;indirect&#x27;.&quot;

The Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution&#x27;s Commerce Clause, in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which permits the U.S. Congress &quot;to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes&quot;. The Court decided that Filburn&#x27;s wheat-growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally, is thus interstate, and is therefore within the scope of the Commerce Clause. Although Filburn&#x27;s relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers like Filburn would become substantial. Therefore, the Court decided that the federal government could regulate Filburn&#x27;s production.

== Background ==
The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 limited the area that farmers could devote to wheat production. Its stated purpose was to stabilize the price of wheat in the national market by controlling the amount of wheat produced. It was motivated by a belief by Congress that great international fluctuations in the supply and the demand for wheat were leading to wide swings in the price of wheat, which were deemed to be harmful to the U.S. agricultural economy.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision states that the parties had stipulated as to the economic conditions leading to passage of the legislation:

Roscoe Filburn was a farmer in what is now suburban Dayton, Ohio. He admitted producing wheat in excess of the amount permitted. He maintained, however, that the excess wheat was produced for his private consumption on his own farm. Since it never entered commerce at all, much less interstate commerce, he argued that it was not a proper subject of federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.

In July 1940, pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1938, Filburn&#x27;s 1941 allotment was established at and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat per acre (). Filburn was given notice of the allotment in July 1940, before the fall planting of his 1941 crop of wheat, and again in July 1941, before it was harvested. Despite the notices, Filburn planted and harvested 239 more bushels () than was allowed from his of excess area.

The Federal District Court ruled in favor of Filburn. The Act required an affirmative vote of farmers by plebiscite to implement the quota. Much of the District Court decision related to the way in which the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture had campaigned for passage: the District Court had held that the Secretary&#x27;s comments were improper. The government then appealed to the Supreme Court, which called the District Court&#x27;s holding (against the campaign methods that led to passage of the quota by farmers) a &quot;manifest error&quot;. The Court then went on to uphold the Act under the Interstate Commerce Clause.

By the time that the case reached the high court, eight out of the nine justices had been appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal legislation. In addition, the case was heard during wartime, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor galvanized the United States to enter the Second World War. The decision supported the President by holding that the Constitution allowed the federal government to regulate economic activity that was only indirectly related to interstate commerce.

== Decision ==
The Act&#x27;s intended rationale was to stabilize the price of wheat on the national market. The federal government has the power to regulate interstate commerce by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. In this decision, the Court unanimously reasoned that the power to regulate the price at which commerce occurs was inherent in the power to regulate commerce.

Filburn argued that since the excess wheat that he produced was intended solely for home consumption, his wheat production could not be regulated through the Interstate Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court rejected the argument and reasoned that if Filburn had not produced his own wheat, he would have bought wheat on the open market.

That effect on interstate commerce, the Court reasoned, may not be substantial from the actions of Filburn alone, but the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers just like Filburn would certainly make the effect become substantial.

Therefore, Congress could regulate wholly intrastate, non-commercial activity if such activity, viewed in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual effects are trivial.

Some of the parties&#x27; argument had focused on prior decisions, especially those relating to the Dormant Commerce Clause, in which the Court had tried to focus on whether a commercial activity was local or not. Justice Robert H. Jackson&#x27;s decision rejected that approach as too formulaic:

The issue was not how one characterized the activity as local. Rather, it was whether the activity &quot;exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce&quot;:

The regulation of local production of wheat was rationally related to Congress&#x27;s goal: to stabilize prices by limiting the total supply of wheat produced and consumed. It was clear, the Court held,

==Aftermath==
&quot;Wickard&quot; marked the beginning of the Supreme Court&#x27;s total deference to the claims of the U.S. Congress to Commerce Clause powers until the 1990s. The Court&#x27;s own decision, however, emphasizes the role of the democratic electoral process in confining the abuse of the power of Congress: &quot;At the beginning Chief Justice Marshall described the Federal commerce power with a breadth never yet exceeded. He made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of this power by warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes.&quot;

Critics have noted that under &quot;Wickard&quot; there is &quot;no distinction between &#x27;interstate&#x27; and &#x27;intrastate&#x27; commerce to place any limits on Congress&#x27; authority under the Commerce Clause&quot;, and that it allows regulation of activity that is generally not considered commerce. 

According to Earl M. Maltz, &quot;Wickard&quot; and other New Deal decisions gave Congress &quot;the authority to regulate private economic activity in a manner near limitless in its purview.&quot;

That remained the case until &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; (1995), which was the first decision in nearly six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The opinion described &quot;Wickard&quot; as &quot;perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate commerce&quot; and judged that it &quot;greatly expanded the authority of Congress beyond what is defined in the Constitution under that Clause.&quot;

In &quot;Lopez&quot;, the Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited and did not extend so far from &quot;commerce&quot; as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of handguns, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. (In a later case, &quot;United States v. Morrison&quot;, the Court ruled in 2000 that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.)

The Supreme Court has since relied heavily on &quot;Wickard&quot; in upholding the power of the federal government to prosecute individuals who grow their own medicinal marijuana pursuant to state law. The Supreme Court would hold in &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot; (2005) that like with the home-grown wheat at issue in &quot;Wickard&quot;, home-grown marijuana is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce:

In 2012, &quot;Wickard&quot; was central to arguments in &quot;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius&quot; and &quot;Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human Services&quot; on the constitutionality of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, with both supporters and opponents of the mandate claiming that &quot;Wickard&quot; supported their positions.

<text>The Royal Gorge Bridge is a tourist attraction near Cañon City, Colorado within Royal Gorge Bridge and Park, a 360-acre (150 ha) amusement park located along the edge of the Royal Gorge around both ends of the bridge. The bridge crosses the gorge 955 feet (291 m) above the Arkansas River and held the record of highest bridge in the world from 1929 until 2001 when it was surpassed by the Liuguanghe Bridge in China. The Royal Gorge Bridge maintained the title of the world&#x27;s highest suspension bridge until the Beipan River Guanxing Highway Bridge was completed in 2003, also in China. The bridge remains the highest bridge in the United States and was among the ten highest bridges in the world until 2012.

The main span of the bridge between the towers is , the total length is , the width is and the towers are high. The steel base structure is covered with 1292 wooden planks.

The bridge was built in six months between June and November 1929 at a cost of $350,000 (equivalent to $ million in dollars). In 1931, the Incline Railway, or simply the Incline (also known as a funicular), was added beside the bridge to reach the bottom of the gorge. In the 1950s, a miniature railroad was built by the edge of the gorge and an aerial tram was opened in 1969. In the early 1980s, the bridge was renovated with new cable anchors, suspension rods and paint. A Skycoaster attraction was added in 2003, with riders being swung out over the edge of the gorge.

In June 2013, a wildfire destroyed most of the park&#x27;s buildings and the aerial tram, and damaged the Incline. The bridge sustained only slight damage to the wooden deck and was otherwise undamaged, along with the Skycoaster. The park was rebuilt and partially reopened in August 2014. The park had a grand reopening in May 2015 with new gondolas and a new zip-line crossing the gorge on the east side of the bridge.

==Construction and location==

Construction began on June 5, 1929 and ended in November 1929. The bridge cost $350,000 and was constructed as a tourist attraction, not as a through route for transportation purposes. The road leading to the bridge from U.S. Route 50 continues on the south side of the gorge eventually re-connecting with Route 50; however, all visitors are required to enter and exit through the north park gate. Passenger vehicles are not allowed to cross the bridge.

The road leading to and across the bridge from Route 50 is designated as Fremont County Road 3A and begins about west of Cañon City. The Royal Gorge Route Railroad runs under the bridge along the base of Royal Gorge.

== History ==

=== 1929–1950s ===

The bridge was built between June and November 1929 at a cost of $350,000 (equivalent to $ million in dollars), which was $100,000 over budget (equivalent to $ million in dollars). The project was financed by Lon P. Piper, president of the Royal Gorge Bridge and Amusement Company of San Antonio, Texas. Piper hired George E. Cole as the Chief Engineer and the bridge was completed in about six months with no deaths or serious injuries. The formal opening occurred on December 8, 1929. Piper agreed to a twenty-year lease of the gorge and surrounding land, which is owned by Cañon City, paying a $1,000 yearly fee (equivalent to $ in dollars) to the city, with a reduced fee of $500 (equivalent to $ in dollars) in some years of hardship.
In 1931, the narrow gauge incline railway was built to the bottom of the gorge through a narrow cleft just west of the north end of the bridge. The first suicide occurred later the same year when a man from Pueblo, Colorado jumped off the bridge. In 1937, a lighting system was installed to illuminate the bridge and the gorge walls.

In 1947, after struggling for many years through the Great Depression and World War II, Piper sold the bridge and leasing rights to a group of local Colorado businessmen and Clint Murchison, a Texan who made a fortune in oil, gas, and real estate. A long-time employee of the park stated that Murchison, who died in 1969, never visited the bridge he had bought, even after he became the sole owner.

In the 1950s, a lodge was built by the gorge and the Silver Rock Railway narrow gauge train with a Chance Rides miniature C.P. Huntington locomotive began running along the edge of the gorge near the bridge. In 1956, Murchison and his Royal Gorge Bridge Company based in Dallas agreed to pay the city a percentage of its revenue instead of the $1,000 yearly fee for the lease. The percentage arrangement has proven very favorable for the city in the ensuing years, allowing it to lower property taxes significantly. The property tax rate has since become the lowest in Colorado.

=== 1960s–1990s ===

In 1967, an open bid was held for the leasing rights with several companies expressing interest in the acquisition. The bid was won by Murchison&#x27;s company, which signed another twenty-year contract with the city. The aerial tram was opened in 1969, crossing the gorge just east of the bridge. Also in 1969, following the death of Murchison, his sons, John and Clint Jr., inherited the bridge and lease.

In 1979, Lucille Murchison, the wife of John Murchison, inherited the bridge and lease after her husband&#x27;s death.

The bridge and the incline railway were listed in the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1983. The official government registration papers indicate that the city of Cañon City had become the owner of the bridge and incline railway at some point since the 1940s, besides owning the land they leased to the Royal Gorge Bridge Company.

The bridge underwent significant renovations from 1980 to 1984. New cable anchors and suspension rods were installed and the bridge was re-painted. The cost of the renovations was over $2.8 million, more than the original purchase price when adjusted for inflation up until the 1980s.

In 1984, Leisure and Recreational Concepts, a Dallas-based company, was hired by Murchison to oversee operations at Royal Gorge Bridge and Park.
In July 1998, William Fehr, the owner of a gravel business based in Parkdale at the entrance to the gorge, purchased the rail lines through the gorge. The sale came after the Southern Pacific and the Union Pacific had merged in 1996 and decided to run their trains on better tracks through northern Colorado. As a part of the purchase, and unbeknownst to Fehr at the time, the sale included the &quot;air rights&quot; above the tracks through the gorge, including the space occupied by the Royal Gorge Bridge. An air rights fee had been negotiated with the railroad companies for $200 per year since 1929, plus another $200 per year for the space occupied by the base of the incline railway. In January 1999, Fehr placed a bid to purchase the entire concession from the city, since the operating company&#x27;s lease was due to expire in 2001. When the bid was declined without consideration, Fehr decided to increase the fee for the air rights to $750,000 a year. The city began investigating legal procedures to possibly condemn the air rights. Eventually, the city and Fehr agreed on permanent easements that cost the city a one-time fee of $99,000.

=== 21st century ===

The Royal Rush Skycoaster was opened on the south side of the gorge in 2003 just east of the bridge.

On October 5, 2003, while performing a proximity demonstration, wingsuiter Dwain Weston was killed attempting to fly over the bridge. Weston was wearing a wingsuit, a skydiving suit with fabric extended below the arms to the body and between the legs to catch air, allowing for horizontal travel when skydiving. He was to go over the bridge while fellow skydiver Jeb Corliss was to go under it. Misjudging his distance from the bridge, Weston struck a railing while traveling an estimated 120 mph, severing his leg at the hip. He fell onto a ledge in the gorge under a parachute that had opened on impact, though it is assumed he had already died.

Between March and May 2012, three people committed suicide by jumping off the bridge. The average number of suicides in the previous twelve years had been one per year according to the general manager for the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park. As a result of the larger than normal costs incurred in retrieving the bodies, Cañon City was billed by the Royal Gorge Express LLC — owners of the railroad that runs below the bridge — for $5,025 for use of specialized equipment and qualified personnel in the recoveries. The three suicides occurred on March 6, March 14, and May 8. The third incident required four trips into the gorge, with the body being found a week later by river rafters.

== 2013 wildfire ==

On June 11, 2013, most of the park structures on both sides of the gorge were devastated by a man-made wildfire. The fire jumped from the south to the north side of the gorge just west of the bridge and burned , of which was park property, over the next four days until it was contained. The bridge sustained only minimal damage with approximately 100 wooden deck planks of 1292 total planks requiring replacement on the south side; however, 48 of the park&#x27;s 52 buildings were destroyed. No visitors, park employees or any animals in the wildlife park were injured or killed by the fire. The Incline Railway was severely damaged and the aerial tram was destroyed. Park executives announced on June 13 that the bridge would be repaired and the park rebuilt. Rebuilding began about a week after the fire and demolition of all damaged structures took about five months. The new visitor center&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremony was on January 31, 2014.

==Park reopening==

The Royal Gorge Bridge and Park reopened on August 30, 2014. A grand reopening ceremony took place on May 8, 2015 after the completion of $30 million in repairs. The rebuilding plan did not include the wildlife park and those animals were relocated. The bridge entry is open daily from 7 am until dusk with the visitor center, rides and attractions opening at 10 am, weather permitting. Attractions that have been refurbished or rebuilt since the fire include a visitor center with an observation deck, a water clock, gondolas to replace the aerial trams, Plaza Theater and Historical Expo, Children&#x27;s Playland, and the original Royal Rush Skycoaster. The Cloudscraper Zip Line — the highest in North America — opened on March 28, 2015. The damaged Incline Railway and the Silver Rock Railway are not listed among current rides and attractions.

In January 2016, the Royal Gorge Company of Colorado paid the city a record high $2.1 million lease payment. Attendance in 2015 was the highest in the park&#x27;s history at nearly 350,000 visitors. The attendance figure represented an increase of 20% from the attendance of about 292,000 in 2012, the last full year of operations before the 2013 fire. For the 2013 season the city was paid $1.68 million by the park&#x27;s operating company, mostly from business continuation insurance. Park officials estimated after the fire that more than 26 million people had visited the park since it opened in 1929.

== Highest bridges ==

The Royal Gorge Bridge surpassed the Sidi M&#x27;Cid Bridge in Algeria in 1929 to become the highest bridge in the world with a deck height of , measured from the deck to the river surface below. The Liuguanghe Bridge in China surpassed the Royal Gorge Bridge in 2001 to become the new highest bridge with a deck height of . The Royal Gorge Bridge surrendered the title of the world&#x27;s highest suspension bridge when the Beipan River Guanxing Highway Bridge in China was completed in 2003 with a deck height of . Several more even higher bridges, mostly in China, have been completed since 2003 causing the Royal Gorge Bridge to drop out of the top ten highest bridges in the world. , the Royal Gorge Bridge is among the 30 highest bridges in the world, and remains the highest bridge in the United States. Several additional bridges more than high are scheduled for completion through 2023, ten of them in China, plus the Chenab Bridge in India.

Since late 2016, the highest bridge is China&#x27;s Beipanjiang Bridge Duge, which has a cable-stayed span with a deck height of . The current highest suspension bridge is China&#x27;s Sidu River Bridge opened in 2009 with a deck height of .

<doc id="1278144" wikidata="Q1809938" url="?curid=1278144" title="Nissan Xterra">
<text>The Nissan Xterra is a truck-based compact SUV manufactured and marketed by Nissan from 1999 to 2015 across two generations; the first (1999–2004) sharing a platform and many of its major exterior parts from the front doors forward with the Nissan (D22) Frontier pickup – and the second (2005–2015) sharing the Nissan F-Alpha platform with the Frontier and Pathfinder.

Sporting a name licensed from the XTERRA off-road triathlon race series, the vehicle was positioned by Nissan as functional and reliable outdoor gear, epitomized by its marketing tagline “Everything You Need, Nothing You Don’t.” 

It was developed in La Jolla, California, by Nissan Design International (NDI)&#x27;s (now Nissan Design America) then Director of Design Tom Semple, and became the first Nissan vehicle completely conceived, developed and manufactured in the United States. According to Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design International (NDI), &quot;the impetus for Xterra designers was to create an affordable, rugged, quality piece of equipment&quot;. He later described it as &quot;a garage tool that says, &#x27;treat me rough&#x27; – it&#x27;s designed to look better dirty than clean.&quot;

While the two Xterra generations differed significantly, both prioritized ruggedness, practicality, and affordability over luxury. Traditional body-on-frame construction and underbody skid plates reflected both its truck heritage and off-road capability. Throughout its lifetime the Xterra used a two-box design with a prominent two-tiered roof enabling second row stadium seating, C-pillar-mounted rear door handles, asymmetrical rear window, and a distinctive tailgate bump-out for an inside mounted first aid kit. For hauling exterior loads a roof rack with a removable forward gear basket was standard equipment.

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; described the Xterra as &quot;an honest SUV that doesn&#x27;t try to be a luxury car alternative, nor tries to hide its truck underpinnings&quot;. &quot;Jalopnik&quot; called it a &quot;knockoff of the Land Rover Discovery&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described it as &quot;rugged without bravado&quot;. 

First generation manufacture took place at Nissan&#x27;s Decherd, Tennessee Plant (engines) and Smyrna Assembly plant (final assembly). Second generation Xterras were manufactured at the company&#x27;s Canton, Mississippi plant (final assembly). Variants were also manufactured in Brazil and China.


== First generation (WD22; 1999) ==

The Xterra was developed in 1999 at (then) Nissan Design International in California. Designed to be &quot;about what people do with the vehicle, as much as what the vehicle can do,” it was introduced in North America in the 2000 model year in two trim levels, XE and SE.

The base XE featured a KA24DE I4, rear-wheel 2WD, 5-speed manual transmission, and steel wheels, and a roof rack (rated for a load up to 125lbs). Options included a 170 horsepower 3.3 L VG33E SOHC V6 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, and part-time 4WD. The SE featured standard equipment that was optional on an XE, including 4WD, side step-rails, and moonroof. All models featured removable, tab-secured rear seat cushions to accommodate a fold-flat rear seat back. Canadian models from 1999 to 2004 were limited to the VG33E V6 engine with part-time 4WD.

=== 2002 update ===

All updates for the 2002 Xterra were executed at the Nissan Technical Center-North America in Farmington Hills, Michigan. It was again available both in rear-wheel 2WD and part-time 4WD models.

The facelifted model debuted at the 2001 Chicago Auto Show with an optional supercharged V6 engine option, revised front-end styling with rounded headlights and raised hood (48mm), revised instrument panel with three round gauges in grey trim (XE) or blue (SE), revised HVAC controls, console with side map pocket, 25 percent larger glove box, map lamp with integrated compass (SE), pull-out rear cup holders, four interior power points, revised new seat fabrics, standard variable intermittent front windshield wipers and rear wiper, optional 300-watt audio system, foot-operated pedal parking brake replacing the dash-mounted pull-and-twist parking brake — and an increase of 10 horsepower for the V6 engine.

The 3.3L VG33E V6 was upgraded to at 4,800 rpm and at 2,800 rpm on the XE and SE models. A Eaton M62 supercharged VG33ER option (carried over from the 2001 Nissan Frontier) was made available only on the SE S/C version. It produced of torque for the automatic, and of torque with 5-speed manual.

For 2003 the front seats received additional adjustability with added lumbar support and in SE models the available 6-disc, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system was replaced by a 6-speaker 300W Rockford Fosgate AM/FM/CD audio system with an 8-inch subwoofer that took up a small portion of the rear storage area. The last of the 2004 model year Xterras were manufactured in January 2005. 

===Brazilian production===
The Xterra entered production in Brazil in June 2003, being assembled in the Renault-Nissan Alliance commercial vehicle plant in São José dos Pinhais. Renault-Nissan had already been building the related Nissan Frontier pickup truck since June 2002. The Brazilian-made Xterra was equipped with a locally built, MWM Sprint 2.8-liter turbodiesel four-cylinder engine developing at 3,600 rpm. Torque rating is at 1,800 rpm.

For the 2006 model year, MWM updated the engine to include common rail injection and an electronic control unit; hence known as the &quot;Eletronic&quot;. Power increased to at 3,400 rpm; claimed torque remained unchanged but at a somewhat lower 1,700 rpm.
== Second generation (N50; 2005) ==

The second generation Xterra debuted at the New York International Auto Show in 2004 and entered showrooms in early 2005 for the 2005 model year. Sharing Nissan&#x27;s F-Alpha platform with the Titan and Armada, it was larger in all dimensions than its predecessor. The standard engine was upgraded to Nissan&#x27;s 4.0 L VQ40DE variable valve timing DOHC V6, producing and of torque.

Early US models include X, S, and PRO-4X, with a choice of 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmissions, a choice of part-time 4-wheel drive or 2-wheel drive. The M226 rear axle with a Dana 44 differential was standard on all manual transmission equipped models as well as all PRO-4X and off-road models. The PRO-4X and off-road also came standard with an electronic rear locking differential and either hill descent/start control or clutch interlock bypass switch on automatic and manual examples respectively. 

===2009 update===
The Xterra received a facelift for 2009 (July 2008 production) with more options and colors, optional leather seats on SE models, new grille and front bumper, silver painted rear bumper and roof rack, and roof mounted lights on off-road models. The last year of the Nissan Xterra in Mexico was 2008. In 2012, production was moved from Smyrna, Tennessee, to Nissan&#x27;s facility in Canton, Mississippi.

Other changes include:
* New HVAC controls and standard audio system.
* Available Bluetooth Hands-free Phone System, steering wheel audio controls and sunglass holder (overhead console) on all grade levels, except X model.
* Removed plastic engine cover.

===Other updates===
*Changed name of off-road model to PRO-4X. (2011)
*Offered optional updated NissanConnect with 4.3 or 5.8 inch screen and smartphone integration for iPhone and Android, allowing the user to connect with Pandora, iHeartRadio, Facebook and more. Capabilities include SiriusXM (subscription required, sold separately), streaming audio via Bluetooth, Hands-free Text Messaging Assistant and audio voice recognition. (2013)
*New 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheel designs for the S and PRO-4X. (2014)
*Heated front seats available on PRO-4X. (2014)
*Available rear backup camera. (2014)

===Discontinuation===
The Xterra was discontinued in the U.S. after the 2015 model year. Poor fuel economy, declining sales, and mandated upgrades to safety and emissions were cited as reasons.

In 2001, the advertising firm of TBWA\Chiat\Day won the &quot;Grand&quot; Effie, a global marketing award, for its introductory advertising campaign for the original Xterra — postitioning the Xterra as reliable and functional outdoor gear, captured in the marketing tagline “Everything You Need, Nothing You Don’t.” 

==Production outside North America==
All Nissan-produced Xterras manufactured outside the U.S. were built in São José dos Pinhais, Brazil until 2007. (Nissan ceased Brazilian production entirely in 2007.) It is built under license by Pars Khodro in Iran as the Nissan Roniz, and in China by Zhengzhou Nissan Automobile as the Nissan Paladin from 2003 to 2013. The &quot;Paladin&quot; uses the same chassis and running gear as the first generation Nissan Xterra, and the 2.4L KA24DE engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. The front end is from the local Pickup. (The second generation Xterra model is only available in North America.) Other difference between the American Xterra and its Chinese counterparts is the parking brake actuator, a pedal with a pull-handle release in America, and a lever in China.

===Dongfeng Oting===
Dongfeng Motors produced a Chinese version of the first generation Xterra called the Oting from 2007 to 2015. It was available with the 2.4-liter &quot;4G64&quot; and &quot;4G69&quot; or a 2.5-liter turbo-diesel engine paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox.

In comparison to pricing, the Chinese market Nissan Paladin was priced at 159,800 to 244,800 RMB (25,264 to US$38,702) while the Oting was priced at 119,800 to 154,800 RMB (18,940 to US$24,473). Trim levels for the Paladin were called the 2WD S, 2WD C, 2WD L, 2WD E, 4WD S, 4WD C, 4WD L and 4WD E. Trim levels for the Oting were called the China III MT L, China III MT E, China III AT L, China IV MT L, China IV MT E, Diesel 2WD and the Diesel 4WD.

== Successor ==
Following the Xterra&#x27;s discontinuation from the U.S. market in 2015, Nissan began testing the D23 Navara-based SUV. The SUV, later named Terra, made its debut in Asia in March 2018, and the updated version was released in the Middle East in November 2020 under the X-Terra name.

<doc id="1278154" wikidata="Q474657" url="?curid=1278154" title="Cream gene">
<text>The cream gene is responsible for a number of horse coat colors. Horses that have the cream gene in addition to a base coat color that is chestnut will become palomino if they are heterozygous, having one copy of the cream gene, or cremello, if they are homozygous. Similarly, horses with a bay base coat and the cream gene will be buckskin or perlino. A black base coat with the cream gene becomes the not-always-recognized smoky black or a smoky cream. Cream horses, even those with blue eyes, are not white horses. Dilution coloring is also not related to any of the white spotting patterns. 

The cream gene (&quot;CCr&quot;) is an incomplete dominant allele with a distinct dosage effect. The DNA sequence responsible for the cream colors is the cream allele, which is at a specific locus on the solute carrier family 45 member 2 (&quot;SLC45A2&quot;) gene (previously known as &quot;MATP&quot; and &quot;OCA4&quot;, among others). Its general effect is to lighten the coat, skin and eye colors. When one copy of the allele is present, it dilutes &quot;red&quot; pigment to yellow or gold, with a stronger effect on the mane and tail, but does not dilute black color to any significant degree. When two copies of the allele are present, both red and black pigments are affected; red hairs still become cream, and black hairs become reddish. A single copy of the allele has minimal impact on eye color, but when two copies are present, a horse will be blue-eyed in addition to a light coat color. 

The cream gene is one of several hypomelanism or dilution genes identified in horses. Therefore, it is not always possible to tell by color alone whether the &quot;CCr&quot; allele is present without a DNA test. Other dilution genes that may mimic some of the effects of the cream gene in either single or double copies include the pearl gene, silver dapple gene, and the champagne gene. Horses with the dun gene also may mimic a single copy of the cream gene. To complicate matters further, it is possible for a horse to carry more than one type of dilution gene, sometimes giving rise to coloring that researchers call a &quot;pseudo double dilute.&quot;

The discovery of the cream gene had a significant effect on breeding, allowing homozygous blue-eyed creams to be recognized by many breed registries that had previously registered palominos but banned cremellos, under the mistaken notion that homozygous cream was a form of albinism.

==Colors produced==
Cream coat colors are described by their relationship to the three &quot;base&quot; coat colors: chestnut, bay, and black. All horses obtain two copies of the &quot;SLC45A2&quot; gene; one from the sire, and one from the dam. A horse may have the cream allele or the non-cream allele on each gene. Those with two non-cream alleles will not exhibit true cream traits. Horses with one cream allele and one non-cream allele, popularly called &quot;single dilutes,&quot; exhibit specific traits: all red pigment in the coat is gold, while the black pigment is either unaffected or only subtly affected. These horses are usually palomino, buckskin, or smoky black. These horses often have light brown eyes. Horses with two copies of the cream allele also exhibit specific traits: cream-colored coats, pale blue eyes, and rosy-pink skin. These horses are usually called cremello, perlino, or smoky cream.

===Heterozygous creams (&quot;single dilutes&quot;)=== 

Horses that are heterozygous creams, that is, have only one copy of the cream gene, have a lightened hair coat. The precise cream dilute coat color produced depends on the underlying base coat color. Unless also affected by other, unrelated genes, they maintain dark skin and brown eyes, though some heterozygous dilutes may be born with pink skin that darkens with age. Some have slightly lighter, amber eyes. However, the heterozygous cream dilute (CR) must not be confused with a horse carrying champagne dilution. Champagne (CH) dilutes are born with pumpkin-pink skin and blue eyes, which darken within days to amber, green or light brown, and their skin acquires a darker mottled complexion around the eyes, muzzle, and genitalia as the animal matures. It is also possible for a heterozygous cream horse to carry more than one of the other dilution alleles. (&quot;see&quot; &quot;Cream mimics&quot; below) In such cases, they may exhibit some characteristics more typical of a homozygous dilute.
Palomino is the best known cream-based coat color, and is produced by the action of one cream allele on a chestnut coat. It is characterized by a cream or white mane and tail and yellow or gold coat. The classic golden shade akin to that of a newly minted gold coin is common, but there are other variations: the darkest shades are called sooty palominos, unusual but most often seen in Morgans, can include a mane and tail with darker hairs and heavy dappling in the coat. The palest varieties can be nearly white, retaining darker skin and eyes, are sometimes mistakenly confused with cremello, and are called &quot;isabellas&quot; in some places.

Buckskin is also a well-known color, produced by the action of one cream gene on a bay coat. All red hairs in the base coat are diluted to gold. The black areas, such as the mane, tail and legs, are generally unaffected. The cream gene acting on a &quot;blood bay&quot; coat, the reddest shade, are pale gold with black points. They are sometimes called &quot;buttermilk buckskins&quot;. The cream gene acting on the darkest bays (sometimes mistaken for seal browns) may dilute to a &quot;sooty buckskin&quot;. True seal brown buckskins can be very difficult to identify owing to their almost all-black coats. It is only the reddish markings around the eyes, muzzle, elbow and groin, which are turned gold, that may give them away.
Smoky black, a horse with a black base coat and one copy of the cream allele, is less well-known than the two golden shades. Since a single copy of the cream gene primarily affects red pigment, with only a subtle effect on black, smoky blacks can be quite difficult to identify. Smoky blacks may have reddish guard hairs inside their ears, and experienced horse persons may detect something &quot;off&quot; about the coat of a smoky black, though the slightly burnished look is often chalked up to sun bleaching, which can also be seen in true blacks. The palest can be mistaken for bays or liver chestnuts, especially if exposed to the elements. Smoky black coats tend to react strongly to sun and sweat, and many smoky blacks turn a chocolate color with particularly reddish manes and tails. Bleaching due to the elements means that the legs retain their color better, and can take on an appearance of having dark points like a bay horse. Smoky blacks, however, will lack rich red tones in the coat, instead favoring chocolate and orange tones. Because smoky blacks are often not recognized as such, breeders sometimes think that the cream gene &quot;skipped&quot; generations.

While there are &quot;color breed&quot; registries for palomino and buckskin horses, which generally record horses based on apparent phenotype and do not require a DNA color test, it is impossible for these colors to breed &quot;true&quot; due to the action of a single copy of the cream allele. Crossing two heterozygous dilutes will statistically result in offspring which are 25% the base color, 25% homozygous dilute, and 50% heterozygous dilute.
When a horse is homozygous, meaning it has two copies of the cream allele, the strongest color dilution occurs. 

*Cremellos are homozygous cream chestnuts, and have a cream colored body with a cream or white mane and tail. 
*Perlinos are homozygous cream bays, which also have a cream-colored body but a mane and tail that may be somewhat more reddish in color than a cremello. 
*Smoky creams are homozygous cream blacks, and very difficult to visually distinguish from cremellos or perlinos. 

All three shades can be difficult to distinguish from one another, and are often only firmly identified after a DNA test. While both red and black pigments are turned cream, the black pigment retains a little more color and tends to have a reddish or rusty tint. Thus all-red coats are turned all-ivory, all-black coats are turned all-rusty cream, and bay coats have ivory bodies with slightly darker points.

Horses with two copies of the cream allele can be collectively called double-dilutes, homozygous creams, or blue-eyed creams, and they share a number of characteristics. The eyes are pale blue, paler than the unpigmented blue eyes associated with white color or white markings, and the skin is rosy-pink. The true, unpigmented pink skin associated with white markings is clearly visible against the rosy-pink skin of a double-dilute, especially when their coat is wetted down. The palest shades of double-dilute coats are just off-white, while the darkest are distinctly rust-tinged. Their coats may be described as nearly white or ivory in addition to cream. 

The off-white coat, pale blue eyes, and rosy pink skin distinguish the coats of double-dilutes from those of true white horses. True white horses have unpigmented skin and hair due to the incomplete migration of melanocytes from the neural crest during development. 

No health defects are associated with the cream gene. This is also true of the normal variations in skin, hair and eye color encoded on the human &quot;SLC45A2&quot; gene. True white coat coloring can be produced by at least half a dozen known genes, and some are associated with health defects. Some genes which encode a white or near-white coat when heterozygous, popularly called &quot;dominant white,&quot; may be lethal in homozygote embryos. Another specific mutation on the endothelin receptor type B (&quot;EDNRB&quot;) gene is associated with the frame overo pattern produces Lethal white syndrome if homozygous, but carriers can be identified with a DNA test.

==Prevalence==
The cream gene is found in many breeds. It is common in American breeds including the American Quarter Horse, Morgan, American Saddlebred, Tennessee Walking Horse, and Missouri Fox Trotter. It is also seen in the Miniature horse, Akhal-Teke, Icelandic horse, Connemara pony, and Welsh pony. It is even found in certain lines of Thoroughbreds, warmbloods, and the Lusitano. The Andalusian horse has conflicting standards, with the cream gene being recognized by some registries, but not explicitly mentioned by others. The cream gene is completely absent from the Arabian horse gene pool, and is also not found in breeds with stringent color requirements, such as the Friesian horse.

==Cream mimics==



Other coat colors may mimic the appearance of a cream coat color. The presence or absence of the cream gene can always be verified by the use of a DNA test. Also, as explained in &quot;Mixed dilutes&quot; below, horses may simultaneously carry more than one dilution gene. Dilution genes which, by themselves, may be confused with cream dilutions include the following:

* Bay dun vs. buckskin: the action of the dun gene on bay produces a buckskin-like coat. Additional confusion occurs because in some countries, it is still customary to refer to buckskins as &quot;dun&quot;, particularly in the British pony breeds. Bay duns tend to have a flatter coat color, more tan or peanut butter-colored than bronze, and also exhibit primitive markings. 
* Amber champagne vs. buckskin: the action of the Champagne gene on bay can also produce a buckskin-like coat. Champagnes can be identified by their freckled skin, hazel eyes, and chocolate (rather than black) points. 
* Flaxen chestnut vs. palomino: Horses having light chestnut coats with flaxen manes and tails, such as those found in the Haflinger breed, can be confused with palominos. However, unlike chestnuts, palomino is inherently a heterozygous condition and thus cannot be true-breeding. Furthermore, even the lightest chestnut will retain &quot;red&quot; character in the hair, rather than gold.
* Gold champagne vs. palomino: the action of the Champagne gene on chestnut was for many years called &quot;pumpkin-skinned palomino&quot;. However, lighter, freckled skin and hazel eyes identify a gold champagne, which can otherwise look much like a palomino. 
*Pearl vs. palomino: the action of the pearl gene only occurs when the pearl allele is homozygous. In such cases, the red hairs are lightened to an apricot color. 
*Pseudo-double-dilute vs. cremello: A horse that has one cream allele and one pearl allele may resemble a homozygous cream, including pinkish skin and blue eyes. A combination of one cream and one Champagne allele may also produce a similar phenotype, though may be distinguishable by lighter yellowish or blue eyes and pale, faintly freckled skin.
*White vs. double dilute: White horses with blue or dark eyes and pink skin are born white and remain so throughout life. Cremello and isabelline horses that bleach out in the sun may approach a near-white shade, but have some skin pigment, exhibited by a slightly more peach skin tone and blue-eyed creams have a less vivid shade of blue when compared to that of an unpigmented blue-eye.
* Gray vs. double dilute: Gray horses are born a normal color and grow progressively lighter in their coat, while double-dilute creams do not. Grays that are not affected by a dilution gene do not have blue eyes or pink skin unless they are due to white markings. There are, however, records of palominos, buckskins, smoky blacks, and double-dilute creams that also carry the gray gene.

==Mixed dilutes==
If a horse carries more than one type of dilution gene, additional cream mimics and other unique colors may occur. The combined effects of champagne and a single cream gene can be hard to distinguish from a double-dilute cream. Freckled skin and greenish eyes, or pedigree knowledge can yield clues, though the mystery can also be solved with a DNA test. 

The pearl gene or &quot;barlink factor&quot; is a recessive gene that affects only red pigment. When a single copy each of pearl and cream are present, the effect is quite similar to cremello. Dilutes combining the pearl gene with one copy of the cream gene are known as &quot;pseudo-double dilutes&quot; and produce a cream dilute phenotype that includes pale skin and blue/green eyes. DNA tests and patience are effective in determining which is the case.

Some of the terms used to describe these combinations include:
* Dunalino, yellow dun or palomino dun: a chestnut-based coat with one cream allele and at least one dun allele. The points are reddish, but the body coat is a paler, flatter shade of gold and primitive markings are visible.
* Dunskin, buckskin dun, or buttermilk dun: a bay-based coat with one cream allele and at least one dun allele. These are quite difficult to tell apart from ordinary duns. They are a slightly paler shade, and retain their dark points and primitive markings.
* Cream dun, cremello dun or linebacked cremello: a blue-eyed cream horse also carrying the dun gene. The primitive markings associated with the dun color are usually quite visible, especially on horses with a bay or black base coat.
* Smoky grulla, silver grulla or smoky black dun: a black-based coat with one cream allele and at least one dun allele. The effect is of an extra-pale grulla.
* Double-cream champagne: any blue-eyed cream horse that also carries the champagne gene. The champagne traits are, in the few known individuals, not visible. The skin is quite pink.
* Amber cream or buckskin champagne: a bay-based coat with one cream allele and at least one champagne allele. The skin and eyes have champagne traits such as skin mottling, while the coat is a pale buff color. The points are a soft, pale grayish-chocolate.
* Classic cream or smoky black champagne: a black-based coat with one cream allele and at least one champagne allele. is also an acceptable term. Like an amber cream, they retain champagne traits in the skin and eyes, and range from pale buff to pale chocolatey-gray. Even though the coat is black-based, the mane and tail tend to be darker. 
* Gold cream: chestnut-based coat with one cream allele and at least one champagne allele. Formerly referred to as &quot;ivory champagne.&quot; The champagne traits remain in the skin and eyes, and the coat is an all-over ivory color.
* Sable cream or brown buckskin champagne: brown-based coat with one cream allele and at least one champagne allele. The coat color falls between amber and classic cream.
* Silver buckskin: bay-based coat with one cream allele and at least one silver dapple allele. The effect varies, as silver dapple does not act on red coats, but the buckskin&#x27;s golden tone is somewhat lost.
* Silver smoky black: black-based coat with one cream allele and at least one silver allele. The effect varies from chestnut-like to silver black-like. Lighter eyes can help with identification.

==Inheritance and expression==

The cream locus is on exon 2 of the &quot;SLC45A2&quot; gene; a single nucleotide polymorphism results in an aspartic acid-to-asparagine substitution (N153D). The DNA test offered by various laboratories detects this mutation. The &quot;SLC45A2&quot; gene encodes a protein illustrated to have roles in melanogenesis in humans, mice, and medaka. Mice affected by a condition homologous to cream exhibit irregularly shaped melanosomes, which are the organelles within melanocytes that directly produce pigment. 

Genes in horses such as Frame and Sabino1 produce white spotting by interrupting or limiting the migration of melanocytes from the neural crest, while the cream mutation affects the nature of the pigments produced by melanocytes. Therefore the skin, eyes, and hair of horses with the cream mutation do not lack melanocytes, melanosomes, or melanins, but rather exhibit hypomelanism.

Prior to the mapping of the cream gene, this locus was titled &quot;C&quot; for &quot;color&quot;. There are two alleles in the series: the recessive, wildtype allele &quot;C&quot; and the incomplete dominant &quot;CCr&quot;. The &quot;CCr&quot; allele represents the N153D SLC45A2 mutation.
* &quot;C/C&quot; recessive homozygotes are not affected by cream and have no true cream traits. 
* &quot;C/CCr&quot; heterozygotes have one cream allele, and one wildtype non-cream allele. Only red pigment in the hair is diluted, as seen in buckskins and palominos.
* CCr/CCr homozygotes (homozygous creams) have no wildtype non-cream alleles. The red and black pigment in the hair are diluted to cream, the eyes are light blue and the skin is rosy pink.

Cream was first formally studied by Adalsteinsson in 1974, who reported that the inheritance of palomino and buckskin coat colors in Icelandic horses followed a &quot;semi-dominant&quot; or incomplete dominant model. Adalsteinsson also noted that in heterozygotes, only the red pigment (pheomelanin) was diluted. 

The discovery that the palomino coat color was inextricably linked to the cream coat color was very significant. At one time, double dilutes, particularly cremellos, were barred from registration by many breed organizations. Cremello was thought by some to be a lethal white or albino coloring and a potential genetic defect. There also were known health implications of albinism in humans, and cultural prejudices; while a heroic figure such as Roy Rogers rode a golden palomino, the &quot;Albino&quot; in Mary O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s &quot;Thunderhead&quot; portrayed a horse with a freakish defect. These coat colors carried vastly different cultural significance. Because the experience of breeders of palomino and buckskin horses indicated that blue-eyed cream offspring of these animals were not genetically defective, some of the research that took place nearly thirty years after Adalsteinsson&#x27;s studies that identified the nature of cream dilution was directly supported by breed registries that had historically barred blue eyed creams.

===Cryptic creams===
The cream gene&#x27;s preferential effect on red pigment has not yet been explained. The champagne dilution affects both black and red pigments equally, the silver dapple gene affects only black pigment, and pearl exhibits a recessive mode of inheritance and only affects red pigment. Unlike the cream gene, pearl does not seem to affect the mane and tail to a greater extent than the body coat, a feature of cream that is most vividly illustrated in the palomino coat color. This characteristic of the cream gene is also unexplained. The disparity in effects on red and black pigments is easy to identify in buckskins, with their black points, but it is also visible in CCr/CCr homozygotes: perlinos (homozygous cream on a bay coat) often retain points that are a darker shade of cream. 

This unusual feature enables what are called &quot;cryptic creams&quot;. A certain percentage of dark bay, seal brown, and black horses exhibit such subtle dilution of their coats as to be misregistered. In the study that mapped the cream gene, three horses registered as seal brown, dark bay or bay were actually smoky black and buckskin. This is one way by which the cream gene is transmitted through generations without being identified. Horses born palomino, buckskin, and smoky black, but also carry the gray gene, have a hair coat that turns white as they age and are usually registered as &quot;gray&quot; rather than as their birth color. This is particularly a common occurrence in the Connemara breed. Horses sold after turning fully gray may surprise breeders by producing golden or cream offspring.

This effect - stronger expression on red pigment - is also seen in coat pattern genes in horses. In general, white markings are more pervasive in chestnuts than in non-chestnuts, to the extent that homozygous non-chestnuts (which carry the &quot;Extension&quot; (E) gene and may also carry the Agouti gene) were more modestly marked than non-chestnuts heterozygous for the &quot;E&quot; allele. This effect has also been identified and studied in the Leopard complex patterns.

===Analogous conditions in other animals===
The &quot;SLC45A2&quot; gene is best known in humans as being the location of a mutation that results in human type IV oculocutaneous albinism (OCA4). Type IV oculocutaneous albinism, like other types of human albinism, results in hypopigmentation of the skin and eyes, with increased rates of skin cancer and reduced visual acuity. None of these effects are associated with the equine cream gene. Other human &quot;SLC45A2&quot; polymorphisms result in normal pigment variations, specifically fair skin, light eyes, and light hair in Caucasian populations.

A presumed knockout mutation in the same gene causes the phenotype of white tigers, which retain black striping though they lack the typical orange background pigmentation. A polymorphism on the mouse &quot;SLC45A2&quot; gene is known to be the cause of the &quot;underwhite&quot; coat color phenotype. The phenotype was first identified in the 1960s, and since then has been mapped successfully. Affected individuals have a reduction in eye and coat pigmentation, and irregularly shaped melanosomes.

<text>The Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck manufactured in the United States by the Japanese manufacturer Toyota since May 1999. The Tundra was the second full-size pickup to be built by a Japanese manufacturer (the first was the Toyota T100), but the Tundra was the first full-size pickup from a Japanese manufacturer to be built in North America. The Tundra was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award and was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Truck of the Year in 2000 and 2008. Initially built in a new Toyota plant in Princeton, Indiana, production was consolidated in 2008 to Toyota&#x27;s San Antonio, Texas, factory.


==First generation (XK30/XK40; 1999)==


The first generation Tundra had many similarities with the older Toyota T100 and the compact Toyota Tacoma. These included the shared use of a 3.4L V6 engine which was the top-of-the-line engine in both the Tacoma and T100. The V6 engine would serve as the base engine for the Tundra, while a second engine was added, a 4.7L V8, the first V8 for a Toyota pickup. Model code XK30 denotes rear-wheel drive models, while XK40 is for four-wheel drives.

Publicly introduced in May 1999 as a 2000 model, the Tundra prototypes and &quot;show trucks&quot; were initially known as the T150. However, Ford and automotive journalists criticized the name as being too similar to the market-leader Ford F-150, and following a lawsuit by Ford, the production truck was renamed the Tundra.

The Tundra was slightly larger than the T100. With a production capacity of 120,000, sales were double the rate of the T100. At its introduction, the Tundra had the highest initial vehicle sales for Toyota in its history. It was selected as &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Truck of the Year award for 2000 and Best Full-Size Truck from &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;. It was assembled in a new Toyota plant in Princeton, Indiana.

Engine choices available in the Tundra were a 24-valve 3.4L V6 engine &quot;5VZ-FE&quot; that produced and of torque and an LEV certified 32-valve 4.7L &quot;i-Force&quot; V8 engine &quot;2UZ-FE&quot; that produced and of torque. The 3.4L V6 was only available until 2004 and the V8 was upgraded for the 2005–2006 model years alongside a new V6 shared with the Toyota FJ Cruiser. 

A Toyota Racing Development (TRD) supercharger was already available for the 3.4L V6 (2000–2003 models) that bumped power to the range and of torque. TRD introduced a second supercharger option for the V8 (2000–2003 models) engine late into its second year of production that increased power to the mid range and torque to the range. The supercharged V8 was dropped when Toyota released the updated VVT-i-equipped 4.7L engine in 2005.


The grille was updated in 2002 (for the 2003 model year), along with a new Stepside bed available on Access Cab models. The Tundra Double Cab, also added to the lineup in late 2003 for the 2004 model year, was a crew cab with four rear-opening doors, with many interior and exterior details brought over from the Toyota Sequoia. Its bed was nearly longer than the competing Nissan Titan or Ford F-150. It is also longer, taller, and wider than the Regular and Access Cab versions, with a longer wheelbase. The Double Cab was only available with the V8 engine, and carried chassis codes UCK31/41, depending on whether it was equipped with four-wheel drive.

The new V6 engine was introduced in 2005, an aluminum-block 4.0L &quot;1GR-FE&quot; rated at and of torque. Also in 2005, the existing 4.7L V8 was updated with Toyota&#x27;s VVT-i variable valve timing technology and was rated at and of torque while the 2006 versions were rerated at and of torque. The engine however was the exact same for both these years and the rerating was only due to a change in industry standards for how data was determined. Therefore the down-rated changes for 2006 were not actually mechanical in nature. 

For the new V6 model, the previous 5-speed manual mated to the 3.4L engine gave way to an optional 6-speed manual for the new 4.0L, and similarly a new 5-speed automatic replaced the older 4-speed. There were never any factory manual options available for the V8. Lastly, for the V8-equipped Tundra, the towing capacity was on the Double Cab and on the Access Cab and Regular Cab models. While suitable for many, the first generation Tundra was reported at the time to not have enough power to compete with heavier-duty offerings of the Big Three (General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford).

In 2003, the T3 Special Edition was sold in conjunction with the release of the film, &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;. It included a TRD performance package, &quot;T3&quot; badging, blacked-out grille and trim pieces, special 17-inch wheels, and T3 limited interior trim. 650 were sold in the US as 4×2 and 200 were sold in Canada as 4×4.

In 2006, the Darrell Waltrip Edition was marketed to honor the NASCAR driver and his participation in the NASCAR Truck Series. Only 2,000 V8-powered Double Cab models were produced. The package included special badging and unique 18-inch wheels.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) rated the Tundra &quot;Good&quot; overall in their frontal offset crash test. It was the first full-size pickup awarded a &quot;Good&quot; score; its competitors from Ford and Dodge were rated &quot;Poor,&quot; and in the case of GM&#x27;s entry, &quot;Marginal.&quot;

==Second generation (XK50; 2006)==
===2007–2013===
A larger Tundra was introduced at the February 2006 Chicago Auto Show. It used styling cues from the Toyota Tacoma along with some cues from the Toyota FTX concept truck (also designed by Craig Kember in 2003). The truck featured towing capacity of over , and a payload capacity of over , a new 5.7L &quot;3UR-FE&quot; V8 engine mated to a new 6-speed automatic transmission. The second generation Tundra had three engine options. The new 5.7L V8 that produces and of torque, and the carry over 4.7L &quot;2UZ-FE&quot; V8 rated at and of torque, as well as the previous 4.0L &quot;1GR-FE&quot; V6 rated at and of torque.

When the new Tundra was first launched in January 2007, it was available in 31 configurations, which consisted of three bed lengths, three cab configurations, three wheelbases, and two transmissions. The new extended cab now had conventional rear doors instead of the previous generation&#x27;s rear-hinged doors; it also took the name &quot;Double Cab,&quot; which was applied to the first-generation crew cab. The second-generation crew cab was renamed as &quot;CrewMax.&quot; The Double Cab and Regular Cab were available with a regular bed or an long bed, while the CrewMax was only available with a short bed. The Tundra also featured a new 6-speed automatic transmission which could lock the torque converter in fifth and sixth gears with a manual shift mode (which was standard with the 5.7L), giving it a time of 6.3 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 14.7 seconds.

Toyota made the new Tundra useful for many construction workers by including extra large door handles, deck rail system, integrated tow hitch, and head restraints that can fit a worker with a hard hat. The Tundra also includes the following as standard: an electronic automatic limited-slip differential (Auto LSD), Vehicle Stability Control, traction control, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist, anti-lock brakes, and tailgate assist. However, its starting price was higher than the Chevrolet Silverado Work Truck and Ford F-150 XL.

Some other changes Toyota included in the new Tundra are optional tow mirrors, a fuel tank, available alloy wheels, backup camera, Bluetooth, large center console (enough to fit a laptop), extra-large disc brakes and calipers, and the aforementioned 6-speed sequential automatic transmission.

All 5.7L Tundras came equipped with a tow package which included engine oil and transmission coolers, an integrated trailer hitch, 4.30:1 axle ratio, and large braking hardware for increased fade resistance. Equipped with the 5.7L V8, the Tundra had a maximum tow rating of depending on body configuration. Toyota began rating the Tundra under the SAE J2807 protocol beginning in 2010.

====Model year changes====
*The 2008 model added 13 variations, bringing the total number of variations to 44. The 2008 models featured additional standard features at a lower price, and also included a new &quot;Tundra Grade&quot; trim which is slotted below the SR5 trim and geared toward tradespeople and the price-conscious consumer.
*Toyota made E85 fuel capability standard for 2009 Tundras equipped with the 5.7L V8 in select regions. Toyota also updated the TRD Sport package and added a TRD Rock Warrior package. Prices increased 0.4% over the previous 2008 model year.

*The 2010 model year Tundra received visual updates to the grille and tail lamps. A premium Platinum trim level was added. A new 4.6 L V8 paired with a 6-speed automatic replaced the previous 4.7 L &quot;2UZ-FE&quot; V8 engine. For added safety, driver and front passenger knee airbags became standard and NHTSA frontal crash test scores improved to five stars. The 2010 Tundra began arriving at dealers in late April 2009.

====Special editions and option packages====

=====Ivan Ironman Stewart Signature Series Tundra=====
In June 2008, Toyota introduced the Ivan &quot;Ironman&quot; Stewart Signature Series Tundra. Three different packages are offered, one of which includes the TRD Supercharger.

As of 2008, Stewart has won the Baja 500 seventeen times driving Toyota vehicles.

=====Rock Warrior Package=====
For the 2009 model year, Toyota introduced a new off-road themed option package called the TRD Rock Warrior. This option package was only available on the 4x4 Tundras with either the Double Cab or the CrewMax cab. Included are 17-inch TRD forged aluminum wheels, LT285/70R-17 BF Goodrich All-Terrain T/A tires, Bilstein shocks, color-matched front bumper and grille, matte-black rear bumper, and fog lights. The interior included black cloth bucket seats, sport shift knob, and pedal covers. Double cab models received a sliding rear window. The TRD Rock Warrior package was only available in Black or Super White. For the 2011 model year, the Rock Warrior package continued with some minor changes. Manual sliding rear window with privacy glass (Double Cab), and TRD Rock Warrior graphics. (Available only in: Black, Radiant Red, Magnetic Gray Metallic, or Super White.)

=== 2014–2021 ===

On February 7, 2013, the refreshed 2014 Tundra was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show. The redesign featured a larger grille, more enhanced fenders front and rear, a redesigned tailgate and tail lights, as well as a completely redesigned interior. The only sheet-metal carried over from the previous model was the cab and the doors. The hood line was raised and the tailgate includes a spoiler. The interior featured a standard 3.5-inch information screen, Bluetooth connectivity, and back up camera. The interior included new seats, new gauges, new controls, updated ergonomics, and a redesigned dashboard with improved materials and metal-look surfaces. Toyota kept the same engines used since the MY 2010 update: a 4.0L V6, a 4.6L V8, and a 5.7L V8. However, the 4.0L V6 saw a increase in power, and was rated at and of torque.

Toyota retuned the suspension with new damping rates to improve the ride quality over the previous models. The steering rack was re-valved to improve the steering feel. The Tundra lineup included a new premium luxury model called the 1794. The 2014 Tundra was available in five trim levels, the SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, and 1794. For the 2014 model year, Toyota discontinued the regular cab Tundra with the box, but other configurations remained the same.

====Model year changes====
*The 2015 model year saw the introduction of a sixth trim level, the Tundra TRD Pro, as part of the new TRD Pro family. A rear under seat storage tray was added to SR5 and Limited Double Cab models, and a 3.5&quot; TFT multi-information display was made standard. The 4.0L V6 was also discontinued.
*The 2016 model has an updated front chrome grille on SR5 and 1794 Edition (on 1794 Edition the front bumper center also switched from Silver to Magnetic Gray). A 38-gallon fuel tank option (standard is 26.4 gallons) on 5.7L V8 SR5 models was included with the SR5 Upgrade Package, while it was standard on Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition, and TRD Pro. 4×2 models were now available with E85 capability. An integrated trailer brake controller was added and was standard on (and exclusive to) all 5.7L V8 models. Blind Spot Monitor and Rear Cross Traffic Alert availability was also expanded as standard equipment on Platinum and 1794 Edition, while also being available on the SR5 (Safety and Convenience Package, which also included front/rear sonar) and Limited (Limited Premium Package). The entertainment system received the updated Entune 2.5 system. The TRD Off-Road Package was also now available on the 1794 Edition. There were also some color changes: Blazing Blue Pearl (8T0) replaced Blue Ribbon Metallic (8T5), Sunset Bronze Metallic (4U3) and Inferno (4X0) were now available on SR5 and Limited (with TRD Off-Road Package (OF)), and the SR was now only available in Super White, Black, and Radiant Red.
*For 2018, the regular cab model with bed was also discontinued, leaving the Double Cab as the entry-level model. The gauge cluster and radio got an update. LED headlights became an option. And Toyota safety sense became standard. 
*For 2020, the 4.6L V8 engine was dropped, and the 5.7L V8 became standard across the range.
*For 2021, a pair of new special edition models, the Trail and Nightshade, were introduced that focused on changes to the truck&#x27;s styling rather than improvements to features.

==== Trim level availability ====
====1794 Edition====
For the 2014 model year, Toyota introduced the 1794 Edition Tundra, designed as a top-tier luxury model to compete with the Chevrolet Silverado High Country, GMC Sierra Denali, Ford F-150 King Ranch, and Ram Laramie Longhorn. The Toyota Tundra plant sits on land that Toyota purchased from the oldest working cattle ranch in Texas. The 1794 refers to the year that this ranch was established by Spanish colonist Juan Ignacio de Casanova. The 1794 Edition is a Western-themed package which includes Lexus-grade saddle brown leather interior, heated/ventilated/powered front seats, wood-trimmed steering wheel and dash, power sunroof, blind-spot monitoring, an Entune Premium JBL sound system with a navigation system, unique 20&quot; Alloy wheels and 1794 Badging. The seats on the 1794 are finished in leather and a suede-like material and features contrasting stitching. The dash and door panels also have leather-trimmed surfaces along with wood accents.

====TRD Pro====
For the 2015 model year, Toyota introduced the TRD Pro option package to compete with the likes of the Ford SVT Raptor and Ram 1500 Rebel. This is marketed as an off-road package that is one step above the standard TRD option package. The TRD Pro includes large 2.5-inch diameter Bilstein remote reservoir shocks at four wheels that allow for a greater extension of the shocks compared to other Tundra shocks. These shocks allow for an additional of travel in the front and in the rear and employ a three-stage damping that gets progressively firmer as the suspension compresses. These shocks allow the Tundra TRD Pro to have a front ride height that is higher than other Tundras. The front coil springs have a decrease spring rated for more suspension compliance. The TRD Pro also include a thick aluminum front skid plate and a TRD cat-back dual exhaust system.

The TRD Pro has a unique body-colored grille with a blacked-out center section and the word &quot;TOYOTA&quot; on it instead of the Toyota Emblem. TRD PRO logo is stamped into the sides of the pickup bed, while TRD logos are on the shift knob, center console, and floor mats. The interior features unique TRD Pro upholstery and door trim with contrasting red stitching and an Etune premium audio system with navigation. The tires are P275/65-18 Michelin LTX A/T2 tires on black finished alloy wheels that have unique TRD center caps. The TRD Pro is available in three colours: Inferno, Attitude Black Metallic and Super White. The TRD Pro is available as an option only on the Tundra SR5 4×4 in either the Double Cab with the bed or the CrewMax with the bed.

For the 2016 model year, the Tundra TRD Pro added Black leather with red contrast stitching and TRD Pro logo. The 38.0-gallon large fuel tank and integrated Trailer Brake Controller was made standard equipment. The color palette was changed to Quicksand (4V6), Magnetic Gray (1G3), and Super White (040). While Super White carried over from 2015, Magnetic Gray (1G3) and Quicksand (4V6) were new. Quicksand was first featured on the FJ-S Cruiser Concept that Toyota and TRD USA used as a testbed for the early TRD Pro Series concept. Quicksand pays tribute to Toyota&#x27;s iconic FJ40 Land Cruiser.

===== Availability =====
===Assembly===
The second-generation Tundra was initially assembled at two different United States locations—the original Princeton, Indiana, plant supplemented by a newly built San Antonio, Texas, plant. Combined, the two plants gave Toyota a maximum capacity to produce 300,000 Tundra units annually or 100,000 units from the Indiana plant and another 200,000 units from the Texas plant. When designing the Texas plant, Toyota arranged for 21 key Tundra suppliers to set up factories on the same site to avoid logistical issues. However, those suppliers were more vulnerable to a market downturn. Toyota also included a $9 million health care facility to serve workers and their dependents.

The Tundra had 75% North American parts content.

In the second quarter of 2008, Toyota moved all Tundra production to the Texas plant. All Tundra engines and transmissions were built in the United States. As sales fell in 2008, production of the Tundra at San Antonio stopped for three months.

===Safety===
The Tundra came equipped with dual front airbags, front row side torso airbags, and rollover sensing side curtain airbags for both the front and rear rows. Vehicle Stability Control, traction control, anti-lock brakes, brake assist, and electronic brakeforce distribution are also standard. For the 2010 model year, a driver and front passenger knee airbag becomes standard.

Toyota&#x27;s Tundra was the first full-size pickup to have earned the IIHS&#x27;s &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; accolade, followed by the redesigned 2009 Ford F-150. In tests conducted by the IIHS, the Tundra received an overall &quot;Good&quot; score in the frontal offset crash test, the highest possible rating in the side impact crash test, and the maximum score for rear crash protection.

The primary difference between IIHS and NHTSA frontal crash testing is the IIHS conducts an offset test where a smaller portion of the vehicle&#x27;s structure absorbs the energy of the crash. This type of crash test is more demanding on the vehicle&#x27;s structure, while the full-frontal crash test is more demanding on the vehicle&#x27;s restraint systems. Both IIHS and NHTSA frontal-impact tests can only be compared among vehicles of similar weights.

Because the Tundra&#x27;s Vehicle Stability Control system is disabled when the vehicle&#x27;s 4×4 system is engaged &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; has questioned the Tundra&#x27;s &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; award. Toyota&#x27;s response is the Tundra does not feature a center differential which would become a weak point in the drivetrain. However the stability control system remains operational at times when the truck is in 4×2 mode though many drivers will select the 4×4 mode in slippery conditions. As of the 2010 model year, this was corrected. Electronic stability control functions in 4×4 High and is disengaged in 4×4 Low. This is verified by the updated owner&#x27;s manual, visor instructions, and road tests in snow and ice in 4×4 High. When understeer or oversteer occurs in 4×4 High, a beeping noise is emitted, and the dash indicator lights up yellow indicating that VSC is activated, braking individual wheels to match driver input at the steering wheel.

===TRD supercharger===
Toyota began selling a bolt-on TRD supercharger kit for the 5.7L V8 Tundra during June 2008. Power output is increased to and of torque. When the installation is carried out by a Toyota dealership the existing warranty remains intact. This kit features Eaton&#x27;s TVS Roots-type supercharger which utilizes twin four-lobe rotors, a design shared with the newly introduced Toyota TRD Aurion, Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 and Cadillac CTS-V. TRD discontinued the TRD Supercharger in mid 2015, meaning that the 2015 model year is the last year that has an official TRD ECU reflash available.

&quot;Edmunds&quot; tested a TRD supercharged Tundra which completed the 1/4 mile in 13.3 sec at . &quot;Edmunds&quot; previously tested a naturally-aspirated 5.7L V8 Tundra which posted a 14.8 sec at time. &quot;Motor Trend&#x27;s&quot; test of the supercharged Tundra resulted in a 1/4 mile of 13.0 sec at . This Tundra needed 4.4 seconds to run from 0-.

===Awards and comparison tests===

==Third generation (XK70; 2021)==
The first official photo of the third-generation Tundra was revealed on June 18, 2021. The pickup truck was officially unveiled during Motor Bella on September 21, 2021. It is built on the body-on-frame GA-F platform. On December 3, 2021, production of the vehicle began in San Antonio, Texas.

The third-generation Tundra is offered with two powertrain options: a &quot;V35A-FTS&quot; twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing and of torque, or a hybridized version of the &quot;&quot; unit with an electric motor housed within the transmission (marketed as &quot;i-Force Max&quot;), producing a total of and of torque. Both powertrain options are mated with a Aisin-sourced 10-speed automatic transmission. For the first time, no V8 engine option was offered. It also had an updated fully-boxed frame and rear coil or air spring suspension. The maximum towing capacity and the maximum payload are increased to and respectively.

The third-generation Tundra is available in seven trim levels, six of which are carried over from the previous generation: SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition, and TRD Pro, as well as a newly-added luxury-oriented Capstone trim. SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition trims are powered by the regular &quot;V35A-FTS&quot; engine, while the hybridized unit is available on the Limited and higher trims, and standard on TRD Pro and Capstone trims. Four-wheel drive system is also standard on TRD Pro and Capstone trims.

The Tundra is available in two cab styles, both offering four front-hinged doors: Double Cab (SR, SR5, and Limited only) with either a pickup box, and CrewMax (all trims) with either a pickup box (the latter being newly-introduced for the Tundra). A 2-door regular cab model is not offered. A TRD Off-Road Package can be added onto all Tundra trims except SR, Platinum, TRD Pro, and Capstone.

In 2022, for the 2023 model year, the SX package became available on the SR5 model with a bed on the Double Cab and foot bed on the CrewMax.

In 2024, for the 2025 model year, the TRD Rally Package became available on all trim levels.

=== Australia ===

The Tundra sold in Australia since November 2024. It is built in the U.S. in a left-hand drive form and then remanufactured to right-hand drive by the Walkinshaw Automotive Group in Clayton South, Victoria. An initial batch of 300 right-hand drive vehicles meant for a 12-month real-world test was made available for lease in Australia for selected customers in November 2023. The lessees of these vehicles will provide feedback to Toyota Australia as required by the testing program. In Australia, it is available in a sole Limited variant using only the i-Force Max petrol hybrid powertrain.

=== New Caledonia (France) ===
The Tundra is currently on sale, as of May 2024, in the French Overseas Collectivity of New Caledonia. It is the only place in the entire French Republic where the Tundra can be purchased officially.

===Safety===
The 2022 Tundra was tested by the IIHS and earned a &quot;Top Safety Pick+&quot; award:

==Recalls and reliability==
During late 2009, Toyota issued a recall on 2000-2003 model year Tundras regarding rust problems of a rear crossmember. This recall involved 110,000 vehicles and followed a similar action for the Tacoma. Tundra owners began complaining of rust issues. In some cases, trucks were inspected by dealers and found to be unsafe to drive. The dealers refused to let the owners take their vehicles without signing an affidavit that they had been informed that Toyota had declared their vehicles unsafe to drive. Complaints were subsequently brought to WCVB-TV Channel 5 investigative reporter Susan Wornick and the story ran repeatedly in spring and fall 2009 prompting the NHTSA to begin an investigation. NHTSA was particularly concerned that owners reported the potential for the spare tire to drop from the vehicle without warning due to corrosion and they opened an investigation on October 6, 2009. Toyota recalled 2000-2001 Tundras, soon expanding it through 2003. If no rust is detected an anti-corrosion compound will be applied, if rust is detected the crossmember will be replaced. While Toyota originally limited the recall to 20 cold-weather states, problems were already evident elsewhere. In March 2010, the recall was expanded throughout the country. Toyota has been replacing frames on affected vehicles rather than paying the 1.5 times Kelley Blue Book value they offered Tacoma owners in a similar campaign for frame rust in Tacomas. Toyota began replacing frames later in the Tacoma campaign.

, Toyota Motor recalled 533,000 trucks and SUVs because of possible steering and suspension problems caused by faulty ball joints. The recall marked a sudden shift in policy for the Japanese automaker after repeatedly denying consumer complaints about ball joint problems and failures in the Tundra and Sequoia. The Toyota recall includes 2004–2007 model year Sequoia full-size sport utility vehicles and 2004–2006 Tundra pickups sold in the U.S. A ball joint in the front suspension may wear out causing the vehicles to be difficult or sometimes impossible to steer. Toyota reported that the defect may be the cause of 11 accidents resulting in six injuries. This could cause the wheel to break off of the lower control arm, cause further damage, and greatly inhibit the ability to control the direction of the truck.

In May 2007, a Toyota spokesperson stated 20 camshaft failures occurred in Toyota&#x27;s all-new 5.7 L &quot;3UR-FE&quot; V8 engine. Toyota said the failures were the result of a flaw in the camshaft casting process, and the supplier of the camshafts has since fixed the error. In the event of a camshaft failure, Toyota will either replace the engine and extend the warranty or repurchase the truck from the owner. Toyota originally intended to begin selling the 5.7L-equipped Tundra during the northern hemisphere summer of 2007 but decided to rush the engine into production in order to match the November 2006 launch date. This decision was the result of product planners and dealers desire for the larger V8&#x27;s availability at the initial sale.

On December 13, 2007, Toyota Motor Corp recalled 15,600 4×4 2007 model-year Tundras in the United States because a rear propeller shaft joint may fail. According to Toyota, &quot;There is a possibility that a joint in the rear propeller shaft may have been improperly heat-treated, resulting in insufficient hardness ... This may cause a section of the rear propeller shaft to separate at the joint.&quot; There has been one reported case of abnormal noises in the affected vehicles. No accidents have been connected to the recall. Tundra owners will be notified beginning in late-December 2007 and are requested to contact their local Toyota dealer for inspection. If the hardness is not correct the dealer will then replace the rear propeller shaft.

The 2007–2010 Tundra was recalled as part of the 2009–10 Toyota vehicle recalls for its accelerator pedal.

Consumer Reports rated the 2013 Toyota Tundra 2WD pickup as having the highest predicted reliability among all full-size pickup trucks. The Toyota Tundra 4WD was rated in second, just below the 2WD model. The Toyota Tundra also was the only full-size pickup to make Consumer Reports most reliable new car and most reliable used cars lists. The Toyota Tundra is recommended by Consumer Reports and is the only full-size truck to have an above-average reliability rating.

The 2022–2023 Tundra was recalled for possible debris left from machining of the engine. This could cause failure of the crank shaft main bearings, leading to reduced power or a stalled condition.

==Sales==
After being on the market for more than a decade, the Tundra had about 17% of the full-size half-ton market.

In 2000, Toyota sold 107,798 Tundras, compared to the Toyota T100 pickup that sold roughly around 50,000 units. By 2005, Toyota managed to sell 126,529 units.

With the added capacity of the San Antonio plant, Toyota planned to sell around 200,000 Tundras for 2007. Toyota missed its sales target for 2007, selling just under 200,000 vehicles. In comparison, for 2007, GMC Sierra sales were over 12,000 more than Tundra, Chevrolet Silverado was more than 422,000 over Tundra, and the Ford F-150 was once again the sales leader with 756,980 units that same year.

Around 70–80% of the Tundra sales were the 5.7 L versions, and 46% were the CrewMax. The standard cab versions were selling at a slower rate than expected.

===International markets===
, the Tundra was sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Honduras, Bolivia, Chile, and the French territory of New Caledonia in LHD configuration only.

The Tundra also has a grey import presence in several countries that include Japan, Taiwan, China, Australia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Switzerland, the Middle East, and Sweden.

Three hundred Tundra trucks are being leased in Australia, starting in November 2023, as part of Toyota Australia&#x27;s testing program whereby feedback is sought from the lessees. These trucks are assembled in the U.S. and remanufactured to RHD by the Walkinshaw Group. Toyota Australia and Toyota Motor Company eventually announced in November 2024 to sell the Tundra in the Australian market starting from Q2 2025.

==Hallmarks==
===NASCAR===
In 2004, the Tundra joined the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and got its first win at Michigan International Speedway on July 31 that year. In 2006, the Tundra got Toyota&#x27;s first manufacturer championship winning 12 of the 25 races. The model also got the driver and owner championship with Todd Bodine and Germain Racing. The truck won every year from 2006 to 2018.

===Pulling the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;===
On Friday, October 12, 2012, an unmodified, Toyota Tundra Crew Max pulled the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, on top of a special lightweight dolly, across the Manchester Boulevard bridge over Interstate 405. The shuttle&#x27;s journey to the California Science Center was primarily performed by four self-propelled robotic transporters. However, due to weight restrictions on the bridge, the shuttle was moved to a lighter non-powered dolly and towed the short distance by the Tundra. Once it had completely crossed the bridge, the shuttle was returned to the robotic transporters to continue its course. Toyota also used this opportunity to film a commercial that aired during the 2013 Super Bowl.

===Million-mile Tundra===
In 2016, Victor Sheppard of Houma, Louisiana, clocked in over on his 2007 Tundra. In the eight years of owning the truck, he logged in an average of a year and had it serviced at his local dealership a total of 117 times. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. gave Sheppard a 2016 model year Tundra in exchange for his old truck; the company disassembled the old truck to study its durability and reliability. Nearly every component of the truck was still fully functioning, and only the bed was showing signs of stress and use because it had been used to transport heavy equipment. This truck and everything learned from it aided in the development of the third generation Tundra.

<text>Pouched rats are a group of African rodents in the subfamily Cricetomyinae. They are members of the family Nesomyidae, which contains other African muroids such as climbing mice, Malagasy mice, and the white-tailed rat. All nesomyids are in the superfamily Muroidea, a large and complex clade containing of all mammal species. Sometimes the pouched rats are placed in the family Muridae along with all other members of the superfamily Muroidea.

Pouched rats are found throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa with the exception of southern Africa. They are characterized by having large cheek pouches and a distinctive molar morphology. The molars are very similar to the type seen in the subfamily Murinae, but pouched rats probably evolved this similarity through convergent evolution.

There are three very different genera of pouched rats. The giant pouched rat is notable for being the largest of the muroids. A giant pouched rat was also implicated as a carrier in a small outbreak of monkeypox in the US. The three genera of Cricetomyinaeds contain eight species.

<text>The Newburgh–Beacon Bridge is a continuous truss toll bridge that spans the Hudson River in New York State. The bridge carries Interstate 84 (I-84) and New York State Route 52 (NY 52) between Newburgh and Beacon and consists of two separate spans. The original northern span, which now carries westbound traffic, was opened on November 2, 1963, as a two-lane (one in each direction) bridge. A second span, completed in 1980, now carries all eastbound traffic. The span provides connections to the New York State Thruway (I-87) and U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) in Newburgh and US 9 in Fishkill. The bridges includes a cantilever span, with a main span of and side spans of . The total length of all spans and approaches is for the north span and for the south span. The bridges, owned by the New York State Bridge Authority, carry six lanes of traffic and approximately 65,000 vehicles per day. The bridge is officially known as the Hamilton Fish Newburgh–Beacon Bridge.

==History==
Although original plans called for a four-lane bridge, funding difficulties resulted in the reduction in lanes. This span was designed by Modjeski &amp; Masters and constructed by Frederick Snare Corporation, Drave, and Bethlehem Steel. The now westbound bridge opened on November 2, 1963, carrying one lane of traffic in each direction.

In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled.
The bridge originally carried NY 52 traffic, which was light, but the construction of Interstate 84 pushed the bridge over capacity, and planning for additional capacity began in 1972. After considering double-decking (which the original bridge was not designed for) the decision was taken by NYSBA to add a second parallel span south of the original. On November 1, 1980, this second, parallel span, also designed by Modjeski &amp; Masters but constructed by the American Bridge Company, was opened to traffic. This eastbound span was built with three travel lanes, and a right shoulder. Because of this, unlike the westbound span, there is no need to reduce the travel lanes to two during off-peak times. It is also made of weathering steel (believed to be COR-TEN or similar, although sources are not clear), the surface of which intentionally corrodes, forming a brown colored protective layer that does not require paint. The bicycle path on the eastbound span was opened in 1981, making it the second interstate funded bike path in the United States. The original span was closed for a major renovation from December 1980 to June 1984, in order widen the deck to accommodate three travel lanes, increase its strengthening, install Variable lane signs, and repaint it a shade of brown to match the color of the eastbound span. After work was completed, the original span was converted to serve westbound traffic, and the 1980 span was converted to serve eastbound traffic, though it still had no permanent shoulders. to allow the right lane to be designated as a breakdown lane at night and off-peak travel times. When the right lane is being used as a shoulder, a red X appears on the signs above it, while a green arrow illuminates when the lane is used for travel during peak times.

In 1997, the bridges were rededicated in honor of Hamilton Fish III, a 12-term member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and his son and namesake Hamilton Fish IV, a 13-term member of the House.

In 2006, the west approach was repaved and a new truck inspection area was built to allow the State Police to conduct inspections in a safe area that would not interfere with regular traffic flow.

The toll plaza was reconfigured in August 2010.

In October 2013, a $94.7 million project to replace the eastbound spans deck was commenced. It was completed in October 2015.

In 2019, a $13,900,750 project was completed that rebuilt the overpass carrying traffic over US 9W in Newburgh, in order to provide better clearance for truck traffic below on Route 9W and to meet current interstate highway standards.

At midnight on July 7, 2021, the bridge was converted to all-electronic tolling on the eastbound span, involved in this was the removal of a large segment of roadway.

In late 2020, a $95 million project to replace the westbound spans deck was commenced. It was considered mostly complete by October 1, 2022, nine months ahead of schedule.

On November 27, 2022, the walkway had its curfew removed, allowing pedestrians to walk across it 24/7.

==Tolls==
Eastbound passenger vehicles are currently (as of May 1, 2023) charged a cash toll of $2.15 to cross the span, or $1.65 for E-ZPass. The toll plaza is located on the eastern (Beacon) shore. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to eastbound-only at that time.

In 2019, the bridge authority announced that tolls on its five Hudson River crossings would increase each year beginning in 2020 and ending in 2023. As of May 1, 2021, the current toll for passenger cars traveling eastbound on the Mid-Hudson Bridge was $1.75 in cash, $1.45 for E-ZPass users. In May 2022, tolls will rise to $1.55 for E-ZPass users and $2 for cash payers. In 2023, the E-ZPass toll will increase to $1.65, and the cash toll will rise to $2.15.

== Notable buildings ==

* Provincial archive of Gipuzkoa, built in 1904 by the architect Cortázar, was one of the first to be built in concrete in the province. From the sixteenth century, Tolosa was home to the provincial archives, formerly located in the parish.
* Town Hall, built between 1657 and 1672, Baroque style, with a ground floor portico and wrought iron balconies. Work of the master stonecutter Juan de Arburola.
* &quot;Zerkausi&quot; Market
* Old Town Hall, a rectangular elongated building that follows the line of the old wall so its façade is perpendicular to the streets of the old town, blocking its southern view. In Neoclassical style, it was completely remodeled in the 1980s as a cultural center. Between 1844 and 1854 it was the seat of the .
* Convent of Saint Francis, located at the exit of the Camino Real a Castilla. With a basilica floor plan, it was constructed circa 1676 by Nicolás de Zumeta and Agustín de Lizarraga. The &quot;retablo&quot; of its main altar and the chapel of the Antia are notable.
* Convent of Saint Clara. Baroque monastery (18th century) of the Poor Clares with a Churrigueresque-Rococo gilded main altarpiece.
* Church of Saint Mary, with of surface at present. The original church was affected by a fire in 1503, but until 1548 works could not be started for lack of money. A building was then erected with three high naves topped by false ribbed vaults supported by six columns, in the local variant of Gothic style called Basque Gothic. In 1761 Martín de Carrera endowed it with the current Baroque façade with a central bell-gable and two towers joined by a balustrade, and a few years later the atrium was added. In the nineteenth century made some Neoclassical alterations. It has a central altarpiece, and in one of the side chapels is preserved the Romanesque-Gothic doorway of the hermitage of San Esteban, which was destroyed by a flood.
* Church of Corpus Christi.
* Palace of Aranburu (17th century), prototype of the Basque Baroque. It is a free-standing building with an irregular floor planned with hipped roof. An austere façade of cushioned ashlars follows the principles of symmetry and centrality characteristic of classicism. A decoration on the main door links with that of the central balcony. The coat of arms of the jurisconsult Miguel de Aramburu, author in 1697 of the &quot;Compilation of the Fueros of Gipuzkoa&quot;, is present.
* Palace of Atodo (16th century), at 35 Calle Mayor in the Renaissance style with ample proportions and façade of ashlars protected by double aileron of carved canes. It features wrought-iron balconies on the main floor and twenty symmetrical openings with lowered arches on the top floor. An artistic coat of arms with rampant lion is shown by a pair of infants in graceful foreshortening. It is the birthplace of , palatine count, captain of the Tercios tolosanos in 1558 and ambassador of Philip II in Rome.
* Palace of Justice (1853), occupies one side of the public square&#x27;s portico. It is a neoclassical group with unified composition, emphasizing the palace through a greater wealth of materials and two floors instead of three with adjoining houses. The portico is transformed here into an arcade. There is a façade of limestone ashlars on the ground floor and recesses and imposts. It is the work of local architects Unanue and Escoriaza. In the court&#x27;s prison, the bard José María Iparraguirre composed the &quot;zortziko&quot; (&#x27;If my mother knew&#x27;). In 2009 it was the headquarters of the Tolosa International Puppet Center TOPIC.
* Palace of Idiakez, built in 1605, rises above the wall in the area of the old Puerta de Navarra. The current building is estimated to date from the eighteenth century after a fire destroyed the previous tower. Its main façade is of hammered ashlar, enclosing the Old Square, while the rear one is of sawtooth brick over the river. In 1794 it was occupied by the fabulist Félix María de Samaniego when he was mayor of Tolosa. The building is today the headquarters of the Casino of Tolosa.
* Door of Castille
* Tolosa Bullring opened on 24 June 1903 ( (&quot;Bombita&quot;) was scheduled to do so, but due to injury he was replaced by (&quot;Bonarillo&quot;) and Guerrerito). It has a ring of with a corridor and 5300 seats. The stands and boxes are above the ring, which gives it a special proportionality. Basque rural sport competitions (&quot;korrikalaris&quot;, &quot;aizkolaris&quot;, stone lifting, etc.) are held here. The city carnivals hold a running of the heifers every afternoon from the day of Fat Thursday and the bull of the brandy on the morning of Tuesday of Carnival.
* Andia Tower located at number 17 on Calle Mayor. Only vestiges of the shield and two gargoyles remain, in addition to the foundations of this medieval building where the enlightened lived, considered &quot;King of Gipuzkoa&quot; ().

== Nature ==

One of Europe&#x27;s tallest Douglas fir trees can be found in the fir plantation in Tolosa.

== History ==
A 9000-year-old human settlement was discovered in the neighbourhood of San Esteban. From the tools and remains of flint carvings found, it would be a group whose economy was based on hunting and fruit gathering.

From the Bronze Age, about 4000 years old, are the dolmens of Belabieta and Añi, burial constructions that bear witness to the first religious manifestations.

In the Iron Age, about 2300 years ago, the first settlements appear. They settled on medium-high mountains, such as Intxur in Aldaba, and protected themselves by surrounding themselves with walls. In addition to their knowledge of iron, they were farmers and ranchers.

The whole of antiquity, including Romanization and until at least 1025, when Gipuzkoa entered history, is an obscure period about which little is known.

The territory of Gipuzkoa was incorporated to Castile in 1200. In 1256, King Alfonso X the Wise of Castile granted the charter to Tolosa, naming it after Toulouse, France. In this charter, the inhabitants of Tolosa were granted privileges that were not granted to the inhabitants of nearby villages, nor to those of other provinces. It also provided for the fortification of Tolosa, Ordizia and Segura, border points with Navarre. The original city was built on an island separated by an arm of the Oria that passed through the current Calle de la Rondilla (previously named after ) and is completely walled, with six gates equipped with defense towers (gates of Castile, Arramele, Navarre, Casa de las Damas, Matadero and Our Lady of Help).

In 1282 it suffered a fire that destroyed it. Sancho IV of Castile granted new privileges to encourage its reconstruction and the arrival of new inhabitants, including freeing those who were to settle there of all tribute to the Crown (Vitoria-Gasteiz, 20 April 1290), privileges later confirmed by Ferdinand IV of Castile and Alfonso XI of Castile.

However, maintaining these privileges was problematic at times, as when in 1463 the tax collector Jacob Gaón demanded payment of the tax called from the Tolosans. They replied that they were exempt from payment because of the provisions approved by the king. Gaón threatened them, and several of them killed him, beheaded him, and put his head on a pillory as punishment for having put Tolosa at the top of his list of collections. King Henry IV of Castile went to Tolosa to avenge his death, but the perpetrators fled the village. The king ordered the house where the crime was committed to be demolished. He did not execute the perpetrators, since before catching them he received a petition from the Junta of Gipuzkoa requesting pardon for the Tolosans, and presented their arguments, and Henry IV acknowledged that they were exempt from payment.

The prevailing insecurity since the 14th century means that over two centuries, several towns and villages joined and separated from the council of Tolosa, including Abaltzisketa, Aduna, Albiztur, Alegia, Alkiza, Altzo, Amasa, Amezketa, Andoain, Anoeta, Asteasu, Baliarrain, Belauntza, Berastegi, Berrobi, Zizurkil, Elduain, Ezama, Gaztelu, Hernialde, Ibarra, Ikaztegieta, Irura, Laskoain, Leaburu, Lizartza, Orendain, Orexa and Igorre. Tolosa is committed to the defense of the towns, which remain under the jurisdiction of the mayor, and are usually ascribed the privileges and charters of Tolosa. During the fourteenth century there were various disagreements with these cities and a conflict with San Sebastián over the cases of Andoain, Aduna and Alkiza, which was settled in 1479 with the transfer of these three towns to the jurisdiction of San Sebastian.

In 1469 it underwent another important fire, and another major one in 1503 that affected even the parish church, despite being isolated. In both cases it was granted new privileges to aid in its reconstruction, and the Catholic Monarchs issued an order for the mayor of the province to reside in Tolosa when not visiting other towns.

After the uprising of the Count of Salvatierra in 1520, during the Revolt of the Comuneros, Tolosa was on the communal side, and the royalist army defeated the resistance of Tolosa and other Basque communal towns after the defeat of the army of the Count of Salvatierra, Pedro López de Ayala, in the battle of Miñano Mayor on 19 April 1521. 

On 9 August 1794, during the War of the Pyrenees, French troops occupied Tolosa. During the Peninsular War it was occupied again. While it was dominated by the Napoleonic army it suffered attacks from area guerrillas.

From 1844 to 1854 under the government of the Progressives, Tolosa was the capital of Gipuzkoa for two years, later returning to San Sebastián, which had been declared the capital city in the decrees of 1822 and 1833, with the consequent transfer of the regional council and all management to the new capital of the province.

Tolosa was one of the most important cities of the territory controlled by the Carlists in the civil war of 1872–1876, and was one of the headquarters of the newspaper &quot;&quot;.

===Spanish Civil War===
On 11 August 1936 Tolosa was captured by rebel Nationalist troops under Major Latorre.

=== Later ===
On 29 March 1939, there was a fatal accident to the overnight &quot;Sud Express&quot; train between Paris and Lisbon.

<text>James Davenport (1716–1757) was an American Congregational clergyman and itinerant preacher noted for his often controversial actions during the First Great Awakening.

==Background and early life==
Davenport was born in Stamford, Connecticut, to an old Puritan family. Davenport’s great-grandfather, Reverend John Davenport, was a founder and first minister of New Haven. He attended Yale College where he was ranked at the top of the class in 1732. Davenport and his friends were determined to become preachers even though most Yale graduates were pursuing law, politics, or business. They started clubs that would attest the changing character of the Yale student body, and frequently found themselves in adversary positions with the university. This is the beginning of Davenport&#x27;s mistrust with established institutions.

He was ordained as a minister by the Congregational Council of Southold, Long Island in October 1738.

==Preaching career and controversies==

It was around this time that he met Presbyterian revivalist Gilbert Tennent and English evangelical George Whitefield. The success of Whitefield&#x27;s style of revival preaching convinced Davenport that God was calling him, and in 1741 - having by chance opened his Bible to 1 Samuel 14, where Jonathan and his armor-bearer attack the Philistine camp, and taken this as a sign - he left his congregation to become an itinerant. His actions during this time often caused him to run afoul of both ecclesiastical and civil authorities.

Davenport often denounced fellow clergymen for their conduct, such as when he labeled Joseph Noyes, the pastor of New Haven, a &quot;wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing.&quot; Throughout New England he used this strategy, of condemning his fellow clergymen, to gain popularity.

Davenport is also noted for his &quot;Bonfires of the Vanities&quot;, the public burnings he organized in New London. As with those of Girolamo Savonarola, Davenport urged his followers to destroy immoral books and luxury items with fire. He often said that he could distinguish people who were saved versus people who were damned just by looking at them.

In June 1742, Davenport and fellow preacher Benjamin Pomeroy were arraigned before the Colonial Assembly at Hartford, Connecticut, charged with disorderly conduct. Pomeroy&#x27;s case was dismissed, but Davenport was declared to be under &quot;enthusiastical impressions and impulses, and thereby disturbed in the rational faculties of his mind.&quot; No punishment was meted out, but Davenport was sent back to his former parish of Southold.

On March 7, 1743, Davenport exhibited perhaps his most bizarre behavior yet, in an incident which garnished him lasting fame—or infamy. The day before, he had led a crowd to burn a large pile of books; this day he called them to throw their expensive and fancy clothing onto the fire, so as to prove their full commitment to God. Davenport—leading by example—removed his pants and cast them into the bonfire. One woman in the crowd quickly grabbed his pants out of the blaze, and handed them back to Davenport, entreating him to get a hold of himself. &quot;This act broke Davenport&#x27;s spell,&quot; wrote historian Thomas Kidd. Davenport had gone too far, charisma or no, and the crowd quickly dispersed.

After the bonfire ended, Davenport was charged with &quot;having the devil in him&quot;, and he replied, &quot;He tho&#x27;t so too&quot;, and added &quot;that he was under the Influence of an evil Spirit, and that God had left him&quot; (49)

According to the &quot;Boston Weekly Post Boy&quot; of 28 March 1743, Davenport had exhibited signs of physical distress along with his unorthodox behavior, symptoms that at the time would have been interpreted as evidence of demonic possession. In 1744, after publicly acknowledging his missteps and apologizing to ministers around the colony, Davenport published a letter titled, &quot;Confession and Retraction,&quot; appearing in pamphlets and in newspapers, including the publication &quot;Christian History.&quot; The letter claimed he had &quot;fallen into the snare of the devil,&quot; confessing to being led astray by impulses and the &quot;false spirit,&quot; and spoke of a desire to distinguish the “Appendage from the Substance or Essence, that which is vile and odious from that which is precious, glorious, and divine” (Davenport).

==Later life==
In the late 1740s and 50s, Davenport struggled to reposition himself in the clerical mainstream. It was hard for him to convince his fellow ministers that he could be taken seriously after being judged insane by two tribunals in Connecticut and Massachusetts in 1742. Moving to Plainfield Connecticut in 1744 as a supply minister proved difficult, as he departed in 1745, unable to find support from the Old and New Lights of the area, receiving criticism from both sides.

In 1749 the New York Synod appointed him to a committee that assigned visiting clerics to northern colonies. Though his career saw improvements in 1750 as a minister in Hanover, Virginia, his preaching differed from that of his earlier sermons—less fiery, less experimental, and without song.

On 27 October 1754, Davenport became pastor of Maidenhead and Hopewell, New Jersey, an office he held until his death on 10 November 1757. He was buried in the Old Cemetery lot of the Pennington (N.J.) Presbyterian Church.

<text>Jean II Le Maingre (Old French: Jehan le Meingre), also known as Boucicaut (28 August 1366 – 21 June 1421), was a French knight and military leader. Renowned for his military skill and embodiment of chivalry, he was made a marshal of France.

==Biography==
He was the son of Jean I Le Maingre, also called Boucicaut and likewise a marshal of France. He became a page at the court of Charles V of France, and at the age of 12 he accompanied Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, in a campaign against Normandy. At age 16 he was knighted by Louis on the eve of the Battle of Roosebeke (27 November 1382). In 1383, he began the first of his journeys that would take up more than twenty years of his life.

In 1384, he undertook his first journey to Prussia in order to assist the Teutonic Order in its war against the pagan Lithuanians, who would convert to Roman Catholicism in 1386. After some campaigns against the Moors in Spain, and against Toulouse in France he again accompanied the duke of Bourbon, this time to Spain, which had become a secondary battlefield of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. From there he travelled for two years through the Balkans, the Near East, and the Holy Land, in the company of his friend Renaud of Roye and later with Philip of Artois, Count of Eu. There, he and his companions composed the &quot;Livre des Cent Ballades&quot;, a poetical defense of the chaste knight, the central figure of chivalry, which Johan Huizinga found a startling contrast with the facts of his military career.
In 1390, while the Truce of Leulinghem had temporarily interrupted the war with England, Boucicaut and two other French knights set up the tournament of Saint-Inglevert, where he jousted, along with his two comrades, against redoubtable English knights, unhorsing three of his 18 opponents. The next year he travelled to Prussia for a third time. Because of his great service in the war against the heathens in Livonia and Prussia, he was named Marshal of France on 25 December 1391 by Charles VI at the cathedral of St. Martin in Tours.

In 1396, he took part in the joint French-Hungarian crusade against the Ottoman Empire, which suffered a heavy defeat on September 28 at the Battle of Nicopolis. He was taken hostage by the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I, but, unlike many of his companions, escaped execution and was eventually ransomed. According to one source, he was only saved because his companion, John the Fearless, son of Philip the Bold and future Duke of Burgundy, &quot;begged the sultan to spare his good friend.&quot; In 1399, he founded the Emprise de l&#x27;Escu vert à la Dame Blanche, a chivalric order inspired by the ideal of courtly love: &quot;one might have supposed him cured of all chivalrous delusions after the catastrophe of Nicopolis&quot;, remarked Huizinga.
In the same year, he was sent with six ships carrying 1,200 men to assist Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaeologus against the Ottomans, who were besieging Constantinople.

In 1401, because of his military accomplishments and his knowledge of the east, he was appointed French governor of Genoa, which had fallen to Charles VI in 1396. He successfully repelled an attack from King Janus of Cyprus, who tried to take back the city of Famagusta on Cyprus, which had been captured by Genoa. Later on, Boucicaut wanted to attack Alexandria but he was prevented by adverse winds to land there, he later went to Tripoli, then after a costly attempt to capture it, he went south to Botron which was burned and pillaged, then to Beirut on 10 August 1403, which was also sacked and 500 bundles of spices worth 30,000 ducats were taken from the Venetian warehouses there, he later went to attack Sidon then Latakia, which both showed resistance due to strong garrison, he returned to Famagusta in late August, eventually to settle in Rhodes in September, where he dispatched 500 men with two large ships who tried in vain to take Alexandria.

On his return, he was defeated by the Venetians at the Battle of Modon on 7 October 1403. After some struggles in the Mediterranean, the Genoese freed themselves from French rule by 1409.

Boucicaut returned to France and became involved in the rivalry between Burgundy and Orléans. In the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 he commanded the French vanguard, but was captured by the English and died six years later in Yorkshire. He was buried in the Collégiale Saint-Martin, at the location of what is now the Basilica of St. Martin, Tours, in his family&#x27;s chapel, with the epitaph &quot;Grand Constable of the Emperor and of the Empire of Constantinople.&quot;

<text>Mehsana (), also spelled Mahesana, is a city and the headquarters of Mehsana district in the Indian state of Gujarat. Established in 14th century, the city was under Gaekwads of Baroda State from 18th century to the independence of India in 1947. Dairy, oil and natural gas are major industries in the city.

==History==

Jaisinh Brahmabhatt describes the following legend in his poems from 1932 AD: Mehsana was established by Mehsaji Chavda, Rajput heir of the Chavda dynasty. He constructed the &quot;Torana&quot; (arc gate) of the city and a temple dedicated to Goddess Toran on Bhadrapad Sud 10 in Vikram Samvat 1414 (1358 AD). The legend is corroborated in &quot;Pragat Prabhavi Parshwanath athva Parshwanathna Chamatkaro&quot; published in Vikram Samvat 1909 (1823 AD) by Manilal Nyalchand Shah who also mentioned in it that Mehsaji built a temple dedicated to Chamunda. Another legend says that Mehsaji established the town in Vikram Samvat 1375 (1319 AD). Both legends describes that the town is named after Mehsaji. These legends also inconclusively establish that the town was founded during the Rajput period. According to another story, Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji had gifted 284 villages to Punjaji Chavda, a descendant of Vanraja Chavda, who had established Ambasan as his capital. His son Mesaji Chavda later established Mehsana.

Gaekwads conquered Baroda and established Baroda State in 1721. Following the third Battle of Panipat, Damaji Rao Gaekwad removed Babi dynasty from Visnagar and conquered Patan in 1766. He expanded their rule in north Gujarat uniting the regions of Visnagar, Vadnagar, Kheralu, Mehsana, Vijapur, Patan and Harij. He established Patan as its administrative headquarters. Later the headquarters was moved to Kadi and subsequently to Mehsana in 1902 when the city was connected by the Gaekwar&#x27;s Baroda State Railway which was opened on 21 March 1887. Sayajirao Gaekwad III built Rajmahal, a palace in 1904.

Baroda State merged with the Union of India after independence in 1947. It was merged into Bombay State as Mehsana district in 1949. Later it became part of Gujarat in 1960 after the division of Bombay state into Gujarat and Maharashtra. Mehsana is headquarters of Mehsana district in north Gujarat.

Following the merger of Baroda state with Bombay State on 1 August 1949, the city was governed by Bombay District Municipal Act, 1902. From 1 January 1956 to 2024, it was governed under Gujarat Nagar Palika Act, 1963. Mehsana Municipal Corporation was approved on 1 January 2025. Total nine adjoining village panchayats: Fatepura, Ramosana, Ramosana NA area, Dediyasan, Palavasna, Heduva Rajgar, Heduva Hanumant, Taleti and Lakhwad; as well as the parts of five village panchayats: Palodar, Panchot, Gilosan, Nugar and Sakhpurda; were merged with Mehsana Nagarpalika to form the Mehsana Municipal Corporation.

==Geography==
Mehsana has an average elevation of above sea level. By Ahmedabad-Palanpur Railway line, the town is divided in two: the east and western parts are known as Mehsana-1 and Mehsana-2 respectively.

<doc id="1278177" wikidata="Q1414902" url="?curid=1278177" title="Mohur">
<text>The Mohur is a gold coin that was formerly minted by several governments, including British India and some of the princely states which existed alongside it, the Mughal Empire, Maratha Empire, Kingdom of Nepal, and Persia (chiefly Afghanistan). It was usually equivalent in value to fifteen silver rupees. It was last minted in British India in 1918, but some princely states continued to issue the coins until their accession to India after 1947. Similar coins were also issued by the British authorities in denominations of mohur (10 rupees), mohur (5 rupees) and the double mohur (30 rupees), and some of the princely states issued half-mohur coins (equal to 7 rupees and 8 anna).

The &quot;mohur&quot; coin was first introduced by Sher Shah Suri of Sur Empire during his rule in India between 1540 and 1545 and was then a gold coin weighing 169 grains (10.95 grams). He also introduced copper coins called &quot;dam&quot; and silver coins called &quot;rupiya&quot; that weighed 178 grains (11.53 grams). Later on, the Mughal emperors standardized this coinage of tri-metallism across the sub-continent in order to consolidate the monetary system.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;mohur&quot; or &quot;mohor&quot; (from the Persian word &quot;muhr&quot;, which means &quot;seal&quot; or &quot;signet ring&quot;) is cognate with the Sanskrit word &quot;mudrā&quot;, which in turn comes from &quot;mudraṇam&quot;, which also means &quot;seal&quot;.

== Collector value ==
Gold mohurs issued by the Mughal Empire, Imperial India, the British East India Company or the British India are valuable collector items and sell in auctions for high prices. The double mohur (minted between 1835 and 1918) with a value of 30 rupees is the highest denomination circulating coin issued till date. An 1835 double mohur was sold at a Bangalore auction for ₹11.5 lakhs making it the highest ever coin bid in India.

The paper was distributed in more than 60 countries, and almost 80% of its subscribers were European citizens. The paper ceased publication in 2017.

The website of &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot; offered news and analysis, opinion, market data, and multimedia features tailored for a European audience by a London-based editorial team. Blogs included New Europe, covering Eastern and Central Europe; Iain Martin&#x27;s blog on U.K. Politics The Source; and Real Time Brussels, offering analysis on events through the European business day.

Content was also available via mobile devices, including a Europe edition of the WSJ.com BlackBerry Reader. A mobile-optimized website provided continually updated news, information, and analysis from Europe.WSJ.com via any web-enabled mobile device or smartphone.

==Circulation figures==
Growth figures for circulation of &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot; may not be directly comparable to that of other newspapers beginning January 2008 due to the &quot;Journal&quot;″s contract with Executive Learning Partnership (ELP) of the Netherlands. This agreement involved ELP&#x27;s purchasing copies of the newspaper at between 1–5 cents a copy, well below normal market price. These copies, given at no cost to students, represented 41% of &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot; circulation by 2010. Since ELP received payments from the &quot;Journal&quot; through intermediary companies, some journalists and a whistleblower then employed by the &quot;Journal&quot; alleged that the newspaper was secretly boosting circulation figures by buying its own papers. This could have had a positive impact on the newspaper&#x27;s advertising revenues. The contract also committed the &quot;Journal&quot; to publishing articles that reportedly promoted ELP&#x27;s activities. While maintaining that the arrangement was legitimate and appropriate, the European managing director of the &quot;Journal&quot;″s parent Dow Jones &amp; Company, Andrew Langhoff, resigned in October 2011. Les Hinton, who was chief executive officer of Dow Jones &amp; Company and who was reportedly advised of the arrangement with ELP, resigned in July 2011 in conjunction with the unrelated News International phone hacking scandal.

<text>North American Cuisine includes foods native to or popular in countries of North America, such as Canadian cuisine, American cuisine, African American cuisine, Mexican cuisine, Caribbean cuisine and Central American cuisine. North American cuisines display influence from many international cuisines, including Native American cuisine, Jewish cuisine, African cuisine, Asian cuisine, Middle Eastern cuisine, and especially European cuisine.
As a broad, geo-culinary term, North American cuisine also includes Central American and Caribbean cuisines. These regions are part of North America, so these regional cuisines also fall within the penumbra of North American cookery.
The term &quot;regional&quot; is somewhat ambiguous, however, since the cuisine of Puerto Rico can differ markedly from Cuban cuisine; Mexican cuisine spills across the border into the Tex-Mex and Mexi-Cali &quot;sub-cuisines&quot;; and the cuisines of Michigan and Ontario have more in common with each other than either has with the cuisines of Manitoba or Iowa.

North American cuisine can also include dishes and cuisines that originated in North America such as the Canadian poutine and regional cuisines like California cuisine.

<text>Nina Kulagina, &quot;Ninel Sergeyevna Kulagina&quot; (, born Ninel Mikhaylova) (30 July 1926 – 11 April 1990) was a Russian woman who claimed to have psychic powers, particularly in psychokinesis. Academic research of her phenomenon was conducted in the USSR for the last 20 years of her life.

Kulagina was suspected of utilizing hidden magnets and threads to perform her feats. She was caught cheating on more than one occasion according to the authors of several books and publications. In 1987, Kulagina sued and won a partial victory in a defamation case brought against a Soviet government magazine that had accused her of fraud.

==Biography==
Kulagina, who was born in 1926, joined the Red Army at age fourteen, entering its tank regiment during World War II, but she was a housewife at the time that her alleged psychic abilities were studied and she entered international discourse in the 1960s. During the Cold War, silent black-and-white films were produced, in which she appeared to move objects on a table in front of her without touching them. These films were allegedly made under controlled conditions for Soviet authorities and caused excitement for many psychic researchers around the world, some of whom believed that they represented clear evidence for the existence of psychic phenomena. According to reports from the Soviet Union, 40 scientists, two of whom were Nobel Prize laureates, studied Kulagina. In &quot;Investigating Psychics&quot;, Larry Kettlekamp claims that Kulagina was filmed separating broken eggs that had been submerged in water, moving apart the whites and yolks, during which event such physical changes were recorded as accelerated and altered: heartbeat, brain waves and electromagnetic field. To ensure that external electromagnetic impulses did not interfere, she was placed inside of a metal cage while she supposedly demonstrated an ability to remove a marked matchstick from a pile of matchsticks under a glass dome.

Kulagina claimed that she first recognized her ability, which she believed she had inherited from her mother, when she realized that items spontaneously moved around her when she was angry. Kulagina said that in order to manifest the effect, she required a period of meditation to clear her mind of all thoughts. When she had obtained the focus required, she reported a sharp pain in her spine and the blurring of her eyesight. Reportedly, storms interfered with her ability to perform psychokinetic acts.

One of Kulagina&#x27;s most celebrated experiments took place in a Leningrad laboratory on 10 March 1970. Having initially studied the ability to move inanimate objects, scientists were curious to see if Kulagina&#x27;s abilities extended to cells, tissues, and organs. Sergeyev was one of many scientists present when Kulagina attempted to use her energy to stop the beating of a frog&#x27;s heart floating in solution. He said that she focused intently on the heart and apparently made it beat faster, then slower, and using extreme intent of thought, stopped it.

==Dispute==
Many individuals and organizations, such as the James Randi Educational Foundation and the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims on the Paranormal (CICAP) express skepticism regarding claims of psychokinesis. Massimo Polidoro has written that the long preparation times and uncontrolled environments (such as hotel rooms) in which the experiments with Kulagina took place left much potential for trickery. Magicians and skeptics have argued that Kulagina&#x27;s feats could easily be performed by one experienced in sleight of hand, through means such as cleverly concealed or disguised threads, small pieces of magnetic metal, or mirrors and the Cold War-era Soviet Union had an obvious motive for falsifying or exaggerating results in the potential propaganda value in appearing to win a &quot;Psi Race&quot; analogous to the concurrent Space Race or arms race.

In the 1960s, Russian journalist Vladimir Lvov published an article in &quot;Pravda&quot; which accused Kulagina of fraud. Lvov wrote that she performed one of her tricks by concealing a magnet on her body. The article also reported that Kulagina had been arrested for cheating the public out of five thousand rubles. Science writer Martin Gardner described Kulagina as a &quot;pretty, plump, dark eyed little charlatan&quot; who had been caught using tricks to move objects. According to Gardner, she was &quot;caught cheating more than once by Soviet Establishment scientists.&quot;

In 1986, the magazine &quot;Man and Law&quot; published by the Soviet Ministry of Justice accused Kulagina of fraud. Kulagina sued the magazine journalists for defamation and won a partial victory on the suit a year later. The court ruled that the journalists did not have direct evidence of fraud. Kulagina was not present at the trial. The Russian Skeptic Society have noted that the trial&#x27;s conclusion &quot;does not say anything about whether Kulagina has been confirmed to have anomalous abilities&quot;.

<doc id="1278191" wikidata="Q2820027" url="?curid=1278191" title="Aaron Brooks (American football)">
<text>Aaron Lafette Brooks (born March 24, 1976) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons, primarily with the New Orleans Saints. He was a member of the Saints for six seasons, where he set the franchise records for regular season and career touchdown passes. Brooks spent his first season with the Green Bay Packers, who selected him in the fourth round of the 1999 NFL draft, and his final season with the Oakland Raiders.

Brooks&#x27; most successful season was in 2000 when he led the Saints to their first playoff victory in franchise history. For his accomplishments with the franchise, he was inducted to the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Brooks lived in a public housing project in the East End area of Newport News. Mentored by Coach Tommy Reamon, Brooks played high school football and graduated from Homer L. Ferguson High School in Newport News. He was awarded a scholarship to attend the University of Virginia (UVA), from which he graduated in 1999.

==College career==
Brooks enrolled at the University of Virginia in the fall of 1994 and was a redshirt as a true freshman. He was a backup to Mike Groh in 1995. He competed with fifth year senior Tim Sherman, whose father Tom was the wide receivers coach, for the starting quarterback job in 1996. The Cavaliers were returning defensive players such as Jamie Sharper, James Farrior, and Ronde Barber. The offense was led by running back Tiki Barber. The coaching staff made Sherman, who had played well against Michigan and Virginia Tech in 1995 after starter Mike Groh went down to injury, the primary quarterback instead of the inexperienced Brooks. Nonetheless, Brooks received playing time in nearly all games and was the primary quarterback in a few. Inconsistent quarterback play by both Brooks and Sherman led to an underachieving season, and Virginia fans still debate the quarterback play of the 1996 season.

Brooks was the starter in 1997. Both Brooks and the team struggled in the early part of the season but surged late to finish the season with a 7–4 record. In 1998, the team got off to a strong start and was briefly in the top ten. The highlight of the year, and Brooks&#x27; career, was the season finale at Virginia Tech. The Cavaliers were down 29–7 at halftime, but Brooks led the biggest comeback in school history in the 36–32 victory. The Cavaliers finished the regular season with a 9–2 record, which earned them an invitation to the Peach Bowl where they suffered a 35–33 defeat at the hands of Georgia.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Green Bay Packers===
In 1999, Brooks began his career as a third-string backup to Brett Favre behind second-string quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, taking no snaps during the regular season.

===New Orleans Saints===
The Packers traded Brooks and tight end Lamont Hall to the New Orleans Saints for linebacker K. D. Williams and the Saints&#x27; third round pick in the 2001 draft ahead of the 2000 season.

In his first season with the Saints, Brooks took over as starting quarterback after Jeff Blake was sidelined with a broken foot in the team&#x27;s 11th game of the season. In his first NFL start, Brooks led the Saints to a 31–24 victory over the St. Louis Rams, becoming the first QB in NFL history to defeat the defending Super Bowl champions on the road in his first career start. Brooks led the team to a 3–2 record in his five starts for an overall 10–6 record, winning the NFC West. In the playoffs, the Saints defeated the Rams, 31–28. The Saints were without their starting running back, Ricky Williams, and lost their best receiver, Joe Horn, early in the game. Brooks threw four touchdown passes to lead the Saints to their first playoff win in franchise history, becoming the first QB in NFL history to eliminate the defending Super Bowl champions in his first career postseason start. The Saints then lost their Divisional Playoff game to the Minnesota Vikings, 34–16.

In 2001, the Saints went 7–9, ending on a four-game losing streak. In those last four games of the season, the Saints would be outscored by more than 100 points, 160–52. Brooks threw a then franchise record-tying 26 touchdowns and a career best 3,832 passing yards in his first full season as a starting quarterback; he also threw a then-franchise record 22 interceptions.

In 2002, Brooks lead the Saints to a 6–2 record and guided an offense that averaged 32 points a game through the first half of the season before the team imploded in the second half. The Saints went 3–5 to finish the season, losing their last three games to teams eliminated from playoff contention.

2003 was Brooks&#x27; most efficient year, compiling an 88.8 passer rating, a 3:1 touchdown to interception ratio, and a 59.1% completion rate, all career bests. However, the Saints finished 8–8 and did not make the playoffs.

In 2004, the Saints started 4–8, but finished the season with a four-game winning streak. The Saints almost made the playoffs but lost out on tiebreakers. Brooks threw 16 interceptions that year, twice as many interceptions as the previous year. 2004 was also the final year Brooks threw for more than 3,000 in a season.

In late 2005, after losing to the Falcons, the Saints benched Brooks and announced Todd Bouman as the team&#x27;s starter for the last three games of the season. It was a poor year for Brooks, who threw 17 interceptions and 13 touchdowns.

===Oakland Raiders===
After being released by the Saints, Brooks was signed by the Oakland Raiders in March 2006. He was the starter going into training camp. In his first regular season game as a Raider, he was sacked 9 times by the San Diego Chargers in a 27–0 loss. Brooks dislocated his shoulder in his second game against the Baltimore Ravens and missed the next several weeks. Second-year quarterback Andrew Walter started the next seven games for Oakland. After a 2–5 record over that span, a healthy Brooks was placed back into the starter&#x27;s role. Despite slightly improved play, Brooks was unable to lead the defensive Raiders to very much success finishing with a league worst 2–14 record. Brooks also went on to have a career low 61.7 quarterback rating, and again threw more interceptions, eight, than touchdowns, three.

Brooks was released by the Raiders when they did not pick up his option after the 2006 season.

==NFL career statistics==
==Post-playing career==
Following his retirement from pro football in 2007, Brooks announced plans to go into property development. In the summer of 2008, work began on his first project to be underway, Burlington Woods, an upscale subdivision located on in James City County, Virginia. Brooks oversaw the project through its completion, and Ryan Homes took over the construction phase.

Earlier in 2008, he announced plans to invest in Southeast Commerce Center, a redevelopment project in his hometown of Newport News. In a July 2008 interview, Brooks described plans to redevelop part of downtown Newport News. The multimillion-dollar investment would be a mixed-use development between Jefferson and Terminal avenues and 33rd and 29th streets in the economically depressed East End area., including 190 town houses, a grocery store and retail offerings. Vice Mayor Charles Allen, who has represented the district for 16 years on the Newport News City Council, said that it was &quot;significant that one of our own has taken his resources and other resources to show us that we can do it. It&#x27;s a good day. It&#x27;s a good day for our community.&quot; Brooks commented, &quot;It&#x27;s a great opportunity to give back to the community and at the same time let retailers know we don&#x27;t just have the stigma of being &#x27;bad news,&#x27; ... a lot of hard-working, middle-class people that live in the area. I&#x27;m just trying to make the area better for them.&quot; As of August 2010, the project had not commenced, but was reported to be back on track after negotiations between Brooks and the city council. The project is now known as Brooks Crossing and continues as of 2024.

In 2014, Brooks was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame, along with former teammate John Carney.

==Personal life==
Brooks is the second cousin of Michael and Marcus Vick.

<doc id="1278193" wikidata="Q207473" url="?curid=1278193" title="Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu">
<text>Călin Constantin Anton Popescu-Tăriceanu (; born 14 January 1952) is a Romanian politician who was Prime Minister of Romania from 29 December 2004 to 22 December 2008. He was also president of the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the vice-president of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), two positions he assumed in 2004. 

He previously served as the President of the Senate, the second position in the Romanian state, from 10 March 2014 until he resigned on 2 September 2019, having previously resigned from his own party, the PNL, and then becoming an independent senator. In July 2014, he established the Liberal Reformist Party (PLR) which later merged with the Conservative Party (PC) in order to form the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE).

==Personal life==
Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu was born in Bucharest. His mother, Alexandrina Louiza, was of Greek ancestry–her mother was fully Greek while her father was half-Romanian, half-Greek. He has been married five times and has three children. Popescu-Tăriceanu is a graduate of the Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest and has a master&#x27;s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.

==Early political career==
Between 1996 and 1997, he served as Minister of Industries and Commerce in Victor Ciorbea&#x27;s CDR-led cabinet. Between 1996 and 2004, he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies, representing Bucharest. Between 2000 and 2004, he was vice president of the PNL group in Parliament, as well as vice president of the Budget, Finances and Insurance Committee in the Chamber of Deputies.

==Prime minister==
Following the victory of Traian Băsescu in the 2004 presidential election, Băsescu appointed Popescu-Tăriceanu as prime minister, in line with a pre-electoral agreement between the two parties of the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA). The new government took office on 29 December; it was approved by Parliament by a vote of 265 for and 200 against. Consequently, he became the first National Liberal prime minister of Romania since 1937.

The Tăriceanu government oversaw a number of major reforms, such as the introduction of a flat tax, the revaluation of the leu, the abolition of conscription and professionalization of the Romanian Armed Forces, and the accession of Romania to the European Union in 2007. His term also coincided with a considerable economic boom in Romania. However, economists criticized several of Tăriceanu&#x27;s policies, such as the introduction of a &quot;first registration tax&quot; for motor vehicles, faulty management of over 2 billion euros acquired following the privatization of BCR, and, most prominently, an increase in the number of public servants and their salaries, which resulted in a major increase in public spending on the eve of the financial crisis.

On 7 July 2005, Popescu-Tăriceanu announced that he and his cabinet would resign in order to trigger early elections. The announcement of the resignation was prompted by the Constitutional Court&#x27;s decision to block a set of laws designed to reform the judicial system. President Traian Băsescu had been pushing for early elections since his victory in the 2004 elections. On 19 July, Popescu-Tăriceanu reversed the decision and announced he would not resign, citing the severe floods that hit the country (for example the Comăneşti floods). Floods killed 66 people in Romania that year, leaving thousands homeless.

At that point, relations began to publicly sour between Popescu-Tăriceanu and President Băsescu, who refused to meet with the Prime Minister in the days following the announced reversal.

In the view of former president Emil Constantinescu, however, relations between Popescu-Tăriceanu and President Băsescu started to become strained following allegations of Băsescu&#x27;s past membership in the Securitate (during Communist Romania).

In September 2005, a newspaper alleged that on 9 April 2004, Tăriceanu bought 10 million shares of the Rompetrol company based on insider information, shares that were sold later that year after he became prime minister. Several other publicly known persons were cited to testify about their involvement in questionable transactions with Rompetrol shares, including the company&#x27;s CEO, Dinu Patriciu.

On 5 April 2006, Băsescu stated that he regrets naming Tăriceanu Prime Minister, and accused him of &quot;partnership with other groups&quot;.

On 29 June 2006, Tăriceanu officially announced that the National Liberal Party (PNL) supports the withdrawal of Romanian troops from international battle zones where they are deployed without a mandate from the United Nations, NATO, or the European Union. This mainly concerns the Romanian troops in Iraq (present there following the Iraq War). This position is strongly opposed by President Băsescu.

On 14 March 2007, Popescu-Tăriceanu postponed the elections for the European Parliament claiming that the political environment was too unstable due to discussions regarding President&#x27;s impeachment, the subsequent referendum, and the fact that President Băsescu asked for a referendum regarding uninominal elections. The media also pointed out that Popescu-Tăriceanu&#x27;s National Liberal Party (PNL) stood to perform poorly in the elections if they were held at the time.

On 21 March 2007, he assumed an &quot;ad interim&quot; (i.e. acting) position of the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs, 43 days after Ungureanu&#x27;s resignation, because President Băsescu refused to accept the nomination of Adrian Cioroianu. On 5 April 2007, the Constitutional Court decided &quot;The Romanian President&#x27;s refusal to name a member of Government at the proposal of Prime Minister started a jurisdictional conflict of a constitutional nature.[...] The Romanian President has no right to veto, but he can ask the Prime Minister to renounce his proposal, if he observes that the proposed person does not meet the legal conditions required to be a member of Government&quot;. The same day, Cioroianu assumed the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs.

On 1 April 2007, Tăriceanu dismissed the ministers of the pro-Băsescu Democratic Party (PD) and formed a minority government with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR); Thus, the second Tăriceanu cabinet was approved by the Parliament on 3 April, with the support of the Social Democratic Party (PSD).

Popescu-Tăriceanu&#x27;s government survived a no-confidence vote on 3 October 2007, following a motion brought by the Social Democratic Party (PSD). Although 220 members of parliament voted in favor of the motion and only 152 voted against it, the motion fell short of the necessary 232 votes.

== Late political career ==

On 26 February 2014, Tăriceanu left PNL due to their intention to leave the Social Liberal Union (USL) and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) to join the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). One day later, he announced that he would launch a new political party, the Liberal Reformist Party (PLR). The party&#x27;s first congress was held on 1–2 August 2014. Popescu-Tăriceanu was elected president of the new party.

On 4 March, PNL leader Crin Antonescu stepped down his position as President of the Senate. On 10 March, Popescu-Tăriceanu was elected as the new president of the Senate, with the votes of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and serving as independent senator.

In late July 2014, Popescu-Tăriceanu launched his candidacy for the 2014 presidential elections. Due to problems with registering his new political party, he ran as independent. Tăriceanu placed third in the election&#x27;s first round, with 5.36%, behind Klaus Iohannis and Victor Ponta. Later, he announced that he would support Ponta in the second round of the elections. However, in the run-off, Ponta was defeated by Iohannis by a 54.5%-45.5% margin.

In July 2015, PLR announced its merger with the Conservative Party (PC), to form a new party, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE), Tăriceanu becoming its co-president.

In 2017, Tăriceanu, claimed that he was a staunch monarchist and &quot;Constitutional monarchy has the advantage of placing the monarch over political games, which is not our case: the president, instead of being an arbitrator, prefers to be a player&quot;.

==Controversies==
Tăriceanu has been accused by President Băsescu of interfering with justice in Dinu Patriciu&#x27;s benefit.

On 24 January 2006, Monica Macovei, then Minister of Justice, made public a meeting with Tăriceanu which took place 7 months before (in June 2005), and to which Tăriceanu invited Dinu Patriciu. Patriciu complained to Macovei about alleged procedural problems regarding his case. Macovei accused Tăriceanu of interfering with justice. On 20 February 2006 Tăriceanu declared on TVR1:&quot; I recognise my fault. I didn&#x27;t act correctly. But I didn&#x27;t influence justice.&quot;

Elena Udrea recalled that, while she was Presidential Counsellor, she saw a note written by Tăriceanu. In a few days President Băsescu found the note and made it public, saying that &quot;The Prime Minister suggested to me a partnership, but, unfortunately, with our oligarchies&quot;. The note was about a complaint from Petromidia about the 27 May procedure problems:

Dear Traian, 1. I send you annexed a document released by Petromidia, regarding the ongoing investigations.2. If you have the opportunity to speak at the Prosecuting Magistracy about the subject?

In May 2007, Patriciu won a lawsuit against the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), which illegally tapped his phones for two years. He received from SRI 50,000 RON as moral prejudice.

<doc id="1278198" wikidata="Q3180088" url="?curid=1278198" title="Joe Horn">
<text>Joseph Horn (born January 16, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the 1996 NFL draft, and also played for the New Orleans Saints, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Memphis Mad Dogs of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Iowa Central Tritons. He played college football at Itawamba Community College. After his playing career, he became an assistant coach at Northeast Mississippi Community College.

==Early life==
Horn attended Douglas Byrd High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he played for legendary coach Bob Paroli. He stood out as a quarterback, tailback, wide receiver, and punter. He was only voted to the Mid-South 4A All-Star team as a punter. Horn was also a standout basketball player in which he started every game for the Douglas Byrd Eagles as a point guard. Horn nearly signed with the University of South Carolina and had offers from other Division I programs. However, his academic performance and SAT score were insufficient for Division I schools.

==College career==
Horn played two years of college football (1991–1992) at Itawamba Community College in Fulton, Mississippi. At Itawamba, he picked up 54 catches for 878 yards and seven touchdowns as a wide receiver and a punt returner. Still unable to qualify for Division I college football, he returned to Fayetteville and worked at a fast food restaurant and at a furniture factory.

==Professional career==
Horn didn&#x27;t play a down of football for two years after leaving college. After playing two years at Itawamba Community College in Fulton, Mississippi, Horn worked at a Bojangles&#x27; restaurant in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Down to his final few dollars, he bought a Jerry Rice workout video from a local Blockbuster and studied the drills and moves Rice performed in the film. Horn then made a highlight video of himself working out and sent the tape to multiple professional teams across the United States and Canada.

===Canadian Football League===
Horn tried out for the CFL Baltimore Stallions and was signed to the practice squad, but never played in a game for the team. Horn also had a minor stint with the Shreveport Pirates. On March 28, 1995, Horn was signed by the Memphis Mad Dogs. With Memphis, Horn played well in 1995, with 71 catches for 1,415 yards, and caught the attention of NFL scouts.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
Horn was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the 1996 NFL draft. He was mainly relegated to special teams and reserve duty at WR during his four seasons with the Chiefs. In his years there, he gained 879 receiving yards on 53 receptions with seven touchdowns, starting only two games.

===New Orleans Saints===
Horn signed with the New Orleans Saints in 2000 and ranked in the top ten in receptions (7th), yards (8th) and touchdowns (9th) that year. Given a starting role with the Saints, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, a nickname he picked up while with the Kansas City Chiefs for his particular style of dress and a name which carries to this day, quickly proved himself to be a premiere NFL receiver. He was selected to the Pro Bowl four out of his seven years with the Saints, and set single season franchise records for receiving yards (1,399), and receiving touchdowns (11-shared with Marques Colston) as well as the career franchise record for receiving touchdowns (50, a record surpassed by Colston in 2012.). Horn is also the Saints&#x27; all-time leader in 100-yard receiving games at 27. Horn had a career year in 2004 with his 1,399 receiving yards being second most in the league. His total was only six yards behind Carolina Panthers WR Muhsin Muhammad. The Saints signed Horn to a six-year contract extension in 2005.

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Horn was noted for his support for the people of New Orleans and the Gulf region. As a leader of the Saints, he served as a public face of the team in many community events in recent months. He frequently visited evacuees in both San Antonio and the Houston Astrodome during the aftermath of Katrina. He criticized the NFL for not making a greater effort to care for the future of the Saints during this time of crisis.Beyond Katrina, to this day Joe donates time, energy and money to local charities in New Orleans and beyond.

After the 2006 season the Saints asked the then 35-year-old receiver (who had suffered a groin injury during the 2006 season and had hamstring injuries in the past) to accept a pay cut. He refused and asked to be released. He was cut soon after his request.

Horn set the Saints career mark in receiving touchdowns (50), making the Pro Bowl four times in five seasons, and compiled the second most receptions (523) and receiving yards (7,622) in Saints history.

===Atlanta Falcons===
In early March 2007, Horn started negotiations with the Atlanta Falcons. He signed a 4-year, $15 million contract with Atlanta. Later, in 2008, he requested to be traded from the team saying he didn&#x27;t want to be a &quot;just-in-case guy&quot; for the Falcons. On August 19, 2008, the Falcons cut him. In his only season with the Falcons he made 27 receptions for 243 yards and one touchdown in 12 games.

===Retirement===
Horn worked out for the Lions, Titans, and Giants, but they ultimately passed and he did not play in the 2008 or 2009 seasons. In May 2010, Horn was selected for induction into the Saints Hall of Fame. On June 23, 2010, it was announced that Horn had signed a contract with the Saints. Two days later, on June 25, it was announced that Horn would officially retire from football as a member of the Saints. Since retirement, Horn has focused his efforts on creating and selling his own &quot;Bayou 87&quot; barbecue sauce.

==NFL career statistics==
==Cell phone celebration==
Always a spirited and outspoken player, Horn gained notoriety for a memorable touchdown celebration on &quot;ESPN Sunday Night Football&quot; against the New York Giants during the 2003 season. After scoring his second touchdown in a game in which he scored four, he pulled a cell phone out from underneath the goalpost padding with the help of teammate Michael Lewis and pretended to make a call. Horn&#x27;s prank drew a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct and a $30,000 fine by the NFL. He later stated that he did not realize what he had done right away. This celebration was later used in the videogame &quot;&quot; which allows excessive celebrations.

15 years later, New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas recreated Horn&#x27;s famous celebration in a game against the Los Angeles Rams after scoring a 72-yard touchdown. Horn &quot;teared up&quot; at the gesture, bought Thomas&#x27; jersey and called him the NFL&#x27;s best wide receiver.

==Lawsuit against the NFL==
In December 2011, Horn made headlines when he and a group of 11 other former professional players filed a lawsuit against the NFL. Horn and his attorneys allege that the league failed to properly treat head injuries in spite of prevailing medical evidence, leading the players to develop effects of brain injury ranging from chronic headaches to depression.

==Coaching career==

Prior to the 2014 season, Horn became a volunteer wide receivers coach for Northeast Mississippi Community College in Booneville, Mississippi

==Healthcare fraud case==
On December 12, 2019, federal prosecutors announced that Horn was one of 12 former NFL players charged with defrauding the league&#x27;s retiree health care plan out of $3.4 million via phony claims for medical equipment. Horn stood accused of conspiracy to commit health care fraud. One week later, he pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud. In November 2021, Horn was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.

==Personal life==
Horn is married with six children. His son, Joe Jr., played wide receiver for Northeast Mississippi Community College for the 2014 and 2015 seasons.

His son, Jaycee, played college football as a cornerback for South Carolina. He was selected 8th overall in the 2021 NFL draft, by the Carolina Panthers.

<text>Michael Anthony Strahan ( ; born November 21, 1971) is an American television host, journalist, and former professional football player. He played his entire 15-year professional career as a defensive end for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). A dominant pass rusher, Strahan set the record for most NFL single-season quarterback sacks (which was matched by T. J. Watt in 2021) and helped the Giants win Super Bowl XLII over the New England Patriots in his final season in 2007. 

Since retiring from the NFL, he has become a media personality. He appears as a football analyst on &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;, and served as a co-host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; as well as &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot; with Kelly Ripa from 2012 to 2016, for which he won two Daytime Emmy Awards. He has also made guest appearances on game shows and other programs. In 2014, he became a regular contributor on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and in 2016 the network announced that Strahan would be leaving &quot;Live!&quot; to join &quot;GMA&quot; full-time. He also hosts the current incarnation of the &quot;Pyramid&quot; game show for ABC.

Strahan was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2021, he flew into space on Blue Origin NS-19&#x27;s suborbital space flight. Many consider the gap between his two middle-upper front teeth as his “signature” feature.

==Early life==
Strahan was born in Houston. The youngest of six children, he is the son of Louise (Traylor) Strahan, a basketball coach, and Gene Willie Strahan, a retired Army Major and a boxer with a 1–1 record against future heavyweight champion Ken Norton. He is the nephew of retired NFL defensive lineman Art Strahan. When Strahan was 9, his family moved to Army post BFV (Benjamin Franklin Village) in Mannheim, West Germany. Strahan attended Mannheim American High School (MAHS), a US Department of Defense Dependent High School, and played linebacker for the Mannheim Bison, the school&#x27;s football team.

The summer before Strahan&#x27;s senior year of high school, his father sent him to live with his uncle Art in Houston so he could attend Westbury High School. Strahan played one season of football, which was enough for him to get a scholarship offer from Texas Southern University.

==College career==
Strahan followed in the footsteps of his uncle Art, who also played defensive end at Texas Southern University. Strahan was so dominant he drew double teams, and TSU coaches dubbed Strahan double teaming &quot;Strahan rules&quot;. By his junior season, Strahan began to turn himself into an NFL prospect. As a senior with the Texas Southern Tigers, Strahan was selected to the All-America first-team by The Poor Man&#x27;s Guide to the NFL Draft, The Sheridan Network, Edd Hayes Black College Sports Report and the Associated Press. He recorded 68 tackles with a school-record 19 quarterback sacks and 32 tackles totaling 142 yards in losses. He was also selected Division I-AA Defensive Player of the Year by The Poor Man&#x27;s Guide and Edd Hayes Black College Sports Report. In 1992, he was named First-team All-Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) and the SWAC&#x27;s Player of the Year for the second consecutive season. He was also named Black College Defensive Player of the Year. As a junior in 1991, Strahan led the SWAC with 14.5 quarterback sacks. His 41.5 career sacks is a Texas Southern record. He was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2014. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2025.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Strahan was selected in the second round by the New York Giants in 1993. He played in only six games due to injuries, and missed the Giants&#x27; two playoff games that season. After a few unremarkable seasons, Strahan had a breakout season in 1997, recording 14 sacks. He was voted into his first Pro Bowl and was also named First-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. In 1998, Strahan continued his success, racking up 15 sacks and being voted into his second Pro-Bowl and All-Pro team. In Week 8 of the 1999 season, Strahan returned an interception 44 yards for a game-winning overtime touchdown in a 23–17 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

===Middle career===
Strahan was a member of the 2000 Giants and participated in their playoff run to Super Bowl XXXV. Despite coming off a strong NFC Championship Game, where the Giants defeated the Minnesota Vikings 41–0, the Baltimore Ravens proved too strong for the Giants and they were handily defeated by a score of 34–7. In 2002, Strahan and the Giants negotiated on a new contract. He said the team failed to negotiate after he turned down its first contract proposal. He accused the front office of not trying to be competitive in 2002. Four days later, running back Tiki Barber ripped him for being selfish and greedy. The two had a heated phone conversation that night, and Strahan said they no longer speak. It also surfaced in the spring that the Giants explored trading Strahan, after which he suggested that management had orchestrated the contract flap to make him look bad. The team denied that.

Few defensive ends in the NFL were more dominant than Strahan from 1997 to 2005. He was named the 2001 NFL Defensive Player of the Year and was a two-time NFC Defensive Player of the Year (in 2001 and 2003). Throughout the greater part of the 2004 season, Strahan was injured with a torn pectoral muscle, which limited him to only four sacks. He rebounded in 2005, returning to the Pro Bowl, with his protégé, Osi Umenyiora, as the two combined for 26 sacks while anchoring the Giants&#x27; defense. Strahan was considered by many coaches, peers, and experts as the standard, and best at his position during the prime of his career (1997–2005). He was also regarded as one of if not the best defensive end ever at defending the run, which made people and peers view him as a complete defensive end.

====2001: Set single season sack record====
In the 2001 season, Strahan set the NFL record for sacks in a single season with 22.5, the highest tally since it was made an official statistic in 1982, breaking New York Jet Mark Gastineau&#x27;s total of 22. In the final game of the season on January 6, 2002, with Strahan coming free, Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre slid down and Strahan fell on top of Favre for an easy sack. After the play, during the ensuing celebration, many of the Giants&#x27; defensive players patted Favre on the helmet. At least one observer accused Favre of deliberately falling to ensure that Strahan would get the record. However, Packers right tackle Mark Tauscher claimed it was just a bad play and &quot;we wanted to avoid that sack.&quot;

===Later career===
On October 23, 2006, with a sack on Drew Bledsoe in a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Dallas Cowboys, Strahan tied Lawrence Taylor for the Giants franchise record for most career sacks with 132 (this total does not include 9 sacks accrued by Taylor in his rookie season of 1981, the year before sacks became an official NFL statistic). It was the last sack Strahan would get that season, as two weeks later he suffered a Lisfranc fracture in a game against the Houston Texans and would miss the remainder of the season and the playoffs.

It seemed as though Strahan would retire after the 2006 season when he did not report to Giants training camp and missed the entire preseason, but the 14-year veteran opted to return for one final year. His 15th and final season proved to be the Giants&#x27; first championship since 1990. On September 30, 2007, he sacked Donovan McNabb from the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday Night Football, increasing his career total to 133.5, setting a new franchise record. On Sunday, February 3, 2008, at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Strahan had two tackles and one sack in Super Bowl XLII, in what is considered one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. Bolstered by a strong defense and unrelenting pass rush, the Giants went on to win the game 17–14, over the previously undefeated New England Patriots, giving Strahan a Super Bowl win. His saying was &quot;Stomp you out!&quot; His final act as a Giant was his acceptance of the Vince Lombardi Trophy alongside John Mara, Steve Tisch and Tom Coughlin.

On June 9, 2008, Strahan retired from the NFL.

Strahan retired with 141.5 career sacks (fifth all-time when he retired), 854 career tackles, four career interceptions, 24 forced fumbles, and three career touchdowns in 200 games over a 15-year career (through the 2007 season). He was also named to the Pro Bowl roster seven times.

On February 2, 2013, Strahan failed to be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; 2013 was his first year of eligibility.

Super Bowl XLVIII, played in East Rutherford, New Jersey, was dedicated to Strahan upon his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014. Strahan performed the ceremonial coin toss, accompanied by the other members of that year&#x27;s PFHOF class. Strahan also commented on the trophy presentation for Fox, since Terry Bradshaw (who had commented on the trophy presentations for Fox&#x27;s previous Super Bowl broadcasts) was mourning the death of his father. On November 3, 2014, he was presented his Hall of Fame ring at halftime of a New York Giants–Indianapolis Colts game by the Giants. In attendance were 100 former Giants players as well as former teammates of Strahan&#x27;s.

On November 28, 2021, the Giants retired his number 92 at halftime of their game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

==Spaceflight==
Strahan flew to space on December 11, 2021, aboard the Blue Origin NS-19. At , he became the tallest person to fly in space. Strahan, along with the other members of Blue Origins NS-19, were the final recipients of the FAA Commercial Space Astronaut Wings, an aviator wings-like badge created by the Federal Aviation Administration to encourage and draw attention to commercial space flight.

==In media==
=== Fox NFL ===

On June 24, 2008, it was announced that Strahan would be joining the &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; pregame show, alongside host Curt Menefee and analysts Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and Jimmy Johnson.

When Fox acquired the rights to broadcast &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; in 2018, it was decided to have Strahan host the &quot;Fox NFL Thursday&quot; pregame show, along with Bradshaw and Long. &quot;Fox NFL Thursday&quot; is televised live from New York City instead of from the &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; studios in Los Angeles so it can accommodate Strahan&#x27;s other live shows (see below), since a coast-to-coast commute on a Thursday night/early Friday morning would be impractical.

=== &quot;Live!&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;===
On October 1, 2010, Strahan co-hosted &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot; as a guest host with Kelly Ripa for the first time when Regis Philbin was absent on the show. Philbin left in November 2011, leaving an empty spot. After twenty guest appearances over two years, Strahan was selected as Kelly Ripa&#x27;s new co-host on September 4, 2012, marking his first official day on the rechristened syndicated talk show, &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot;. Ratings instantly surged, impressively generating year-over-year time slot gains across all key demographics, towering over its nearest competition, the fourth hour of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, by 87 percent. On April 19, 2016, ABC announced that Strahan would be leaving &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot; to begin working full-time on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Strahan together with co-host Ripa won a Daytime Emmy twice for &quot;Outstanding Talk Show Host&quot; during his tenure on the show.

In 2018, Strahan began co-hosting a daytime talk show spin-off of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, originally titled &quot;GMA Day&quot;, alongside Sara Haines. In January 2019, the program was retitled &quot;Strahan and Sara&quot;, then finally &quot;Strahan, Sara and Keke&quot; in August 2019, to coincide with the addition of actress Keke Palmer. The show was put on hiatus in March 2020 due to ABC News coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was officially cancelled in the fall of that year.

=== &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; ===
In 2016, ABC announced that Strahan would be hosting a summer revival of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;, which would air on Sunday nights along with the Steve Harvey-hosted &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot; and the Alec Baldwin-hosted &quot;Match Game&quot; as part of a &quot;Sunday Fun &amp; Games&quot; lineup. Strahan said that &quot;Pyramid&quot; was one of his favorite game shows growing up. The series has since been renewed for six seasons. Pyramid did not air in the summer of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== &quot;Collection by Michael Strahan&quot; ==
On September 8, 2015, Strahan launched a men&#x27;s clothing line exclusively through JCPenney. It Includes suits, blazers, sports shirts, belts, ties, cufflinks, suspenders, and other accessories.

==Personal life==
His uncle, Art Strahan, played as a defensive lineman for the Houston Oilers (1965) and Atlanta Falcons (1968). In an episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Strahan learned that he has Anglo-Saxon ancestry that traces directly to Charlemagne, who is his 39-great-grandfather.

Strahan was married to his first wife, Wanda Hutchins, from 1992 to 1996. Hutchins is an American businesswoman, interior designer, and home decorator. They have a daughter, Tanita Strahan, and a son, Michael Anthony Strahan Jr. Strahan moved them to the U.S. and purchased a $163,000 house in the same Houston neighborhood where his parents live.

In 1999, Strahan married Jean Muggli after meeting her at a spa. They have twin daughters, Isabella and Sophia, born December 2004. , Strahan lives in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. Strahan and Muggli finalized their divorce on July 20, 2006. In January 2007, Judge James B. Convery awarded Muggli $15 million in a divorce settlement in addition to $18,000 monthly child support. Strahan appealed. In March 2007, the court ordered the Montclair, New Jersey mansion to be auctioned and the sales money split evenly; the house was valued at $3.6 million.

In August 2009, Strahan became engaged to Nicole Mitchell, Eddie Murphy&#x27;s ex-wife, but the two ended their engagement in 2014. In June 2011, Strahan filmed a commercial supporting legalizing same-sex marriage in New York.

Since around 2015, he has been dating Kayla Quick.

===Philanthropy===
In 2002, Strahan had a multimillion-dollar restoration and renovation done on Georgian Heights. The turn-of-the-19th-century mansion is located on 2.3 acres of mountainside property and boasts sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline. The home was built in 1906 at 99 Lloyd Avenue, Montclair, New Jersey. It is a red brick house with a carriage house and a greenhouse that he bought in 2000 for $1.3 million. Before moving in, he allowed the Junior League of Montclair-Newark to use his house as a model home for its charity fundraiser. From May 28 to 31, the League decorated the mansion, had a &quot;bare bones&quot; party and a black-tie affair, and held $25 tours to fund the Junior League programs Children At Risk and HomeCorp. Children At Risk aids children and families and HomeCorp helps low-income people achieve home ownership.

In February 2008, Strahan and Giants teammate Justin Tuck teamed up with Nike to design their own exclusive sneakers for ID studio in New York City. All proceeds from the sneakers were donated to Nike&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Play&quot; global campaign.

In December 2018, Strahan volunteered at St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and was featured in a series of holiday promotions.

<doc id="1278221" wikidata="Q417421" url="?curid=1278221" title="Hübnerite">
<text>Hübnerite or hubnerite is a mineral consisting of manganese tungsten oxide (chemical formula MnWO4). It is the manganese endmember of the manganese–iron wolframite solid solution series. 
It forms reddish brown to black monoclinic prismatic submetallic crystals. The crystals are typically flattened and occur with fine striations. It has a high specific gravity of 7.15 and a Mohs hardness of 4.5. It is transparent to translucent with perfect cleavage. Refractive index values are nα = 2.170 – 2.200, nβ = 2.220, and nγ = 2.300 – 2.320.

Typical occurrence is in association with high-temperature hydrothermal vein deposits and altered granites with greisen, granite pegmatites and in alluvial deposits. It occurs associated with cassiterite, arsenopyrite, molybdenite, tourmaline, topaz, rhodochrosite and fluorite.

It was first described in 1865 for an occurrence in the Erie and Enterprise veins, Mammoth district, Nye County, Nevada, and named after the German mining engineer and metallurgist, Adolf Hübner from Freiberg, Saxony.

==Introduction==
Hübnerite is a rare mineral from the rare family wolframite. It is considered to be one of the principle ores of tungsten. It is usually identified by the dark color, one direction of perfect cleavage and high specific gravity all serving to distinguish it from other minerals. The first recorded identification of the wolframite family was back in 1948 but it was not added as a mineral until 1951.

==Composition==
Since hübnerite comes from a family with only two end members it would be easier to explain the composition of the wolframite family since there is not enough data on hübnerite itself. The primary formula of the wolframite series is . The predominance of either iron or manganese results in formation of one of two minerals, the compositional end-members (ferberite) and (hübnerite), respectively. Hübnerite is rarer than ferberite because of the difficulty of substituting manganese for iron. There are also other analogues, such as . These compounds are usually referred to as &quot;wolframites&quot; because they share the wolframite structure, but are not naturally occurring minerals, typically being produced for industrial applications, e.g., crystal scintillators.

==Structure==

Hübnerite is a rare end-member of the wolframite group, and has the same crystal structure as other members of the family. The crystal structure contains distorted tetrahedral () and octahedral () units. The wolframite family represents complete solid solution between Fe2+ and Mn2+. In ferberite, the percentage of WO3 is around 76.3% whereas in hübnerite it is around 76.6%. In naturally occurring minerals the percent range falls within 20-80 percent. In the past it was thought that the wolframite structure possesses orthorhombic symmetry but in fact it possesses monoclinic symmetry. Short prismatic, flattened or wedge-shaped crystals are the common morphologies of wolframite crystals. In some rare cases the crystals occur doubly terminated. It is common for the faces to be striated parallel to the c axis. In most cases, wolframite is found embedded in quartz as subparallel crystalline masses.

==Physical properties==
Color differences between members of the wolframite family are clear and marked. The color of hübnerite varies from yellowish brown to reddish brown. Crystal and crystalline masses of hübnerite show a variety of lusters from adamantine, submetallic to resinous luster. In thin splints, hübnerite can be either transparent or translucent. The streak is related to the color being a shade lighter. All the wolframite minerals exhibit perfect cleavage on {010}. On {100} and {102}, parting is less well-developed. Hübnerite exhibits brittle and uneven fracture. It is common for all members of the wolframite family to show simple contact twins on {100} or rarely interpenetrant twins on {001}. The hardness of hübnerite is between 4 and 4.5 and its specific gravity is between 7.12 and 7.18.

==Geological occurrence==
Hübnerite is a rare member of the wolframite group. Hübnerite is usually found within pegmatites and high-temperature quartz veins. Hübnerite does not occur on its own, but is typically associated with other minerals such as cassiterite, scheelite, quartz, galena, arsenopyrite, native bismuth, pyrite, and sphalerite.

==History and uses==
Hübnerite was not the original name giving to the mineral. Hübnerite is a synonym of the original name, megabasite. The name megabasite was given to the mineral by A. Breithaupt in 1852. The name hübnerite was given to the mineral by E.N. Riotte in 1865 to honor the metallurgist Adolph Hübner.

Hübnerite is primarily used as a source of tungsten. Tungsten is used to harden metal in the manufacture of high-speed tools.

<text>Spotswood High School is a high school in Penn Laird, Virginia, in shadow of the Massanutten Peak. As of 2008, it competes in the Virginia High School League.

==History==
Spotswood High School had its formal beginning in 1973 when the County School Board authorized an Eastern Rockingham building study and requested a report on a proposed new high school for eastern Rockingham County.

A committee, composed of community persons from the Elkton and Montevideo attendance areas, as well as Central Office staff members, three Principals and several teachers from both Montevideo and Elkton High Schools, was organized to develop the education specifications for the proposed new plant. Although the proposal to build the new school was not implemented at this time, the work of the educational specifications committee served as a foundation for the planning of the present school.

During the summer of 1976 the School Board voted to build a senior high school, grades 10-12, to house Montevideo and Elkton High School students. A committee of twenty-one people was appointed to draft a set of educational specifications for the proposed new facility. The committee completed its report during the 1976-1977 school year, and later revised it when a specific starting date for construction was established.

Specific plans for names, nicknames, and colors were developed by a committee of nine persons that made final reports to the School Board in December 1978. The School Board reviewed the report and voted to name to the school the Spotswood Senior High School, in memory of Alexander Spotswood. The Board decided to leave the decision for the school&#x27;s nickname and colors to the administration and students.

Spotswood High School was established in 1980 as Spotswood Senior High School, serving grades 10-12. James Upperman was the first principal. The school was named in honor of Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Spotswood. The school colors, blue and gray, were selected from the colors of the two high schools it consolidated in the 1980s: Elkton High School (blue and gold) and Montevideo (maroon and gray). Elkton&#x27;s High School color was actually navy blue, however, royal blue was used instead. The official nickname selected was Trailblazers even though it is rarely used. In the fall of 1984, Spotswood became a 9-12 school and changed to its present name, Spotswood High School.

In 2009, Rockingham County Public Schools took notice of the increased population in the eastern portion of Rockingham County and opened its fourth high school, East Rockingham High School. The opening of ERHS alleviated the overcrowding problem at Spotswood and cut the enrollment of the school in half.

In 2008, the student body population was reported by the Board of Education to have the following enrollment characteristics. In 2008, the student population was approaching 1500, but after the new East Rockingham High School opened in 2009, the overcrowding problem was alleviated temporarily. In 2020, students from the Grottoes area were moved to East Rockingham High School due to further overcrowding.

==Band==

Spotswood High School was named a Virginia Honor Band in 2007-2008. This is the first time the band program has received this honor since 2004-2005. The Spotswood Fine Arts Program has also been nominated for the VMEA Blue Ribbon Award, which honors programs in that have worked towards a superior rating for the Marching Band, Concert Band, and Choir-which Spotswood High School did in 2007-2008.

Spotswood High School, in Penn Laird Virginia, has several musical groups, including concert band, wind ensemble, one percussion ensembles, a jazz ensemble, and the Marching Trailblazers, composed of winds, percussion, and the color guard.

The band program at SHS has won numerous musical awards in many categories for each group, including nine Virginia Honor Band awards, which require a superior rating from each the Symphonic Band and the Marching Band. A Virginia Honors Band award requires that the marching band receive a superior rating (I) at the annual state marching festival, and the highest level concert band of the school also receive a superior (I).

There are usually two or three &#x27;stage&#x27; concerts, in some combination of Concert, Symphonic, and Jazz, at Spotswood per year; in addition, the two concert bands perform yearly at the VBODA District Band Festival. The marching band performs at every home football game on Friday nights, as well as various competitions throughout the fall.

==Controversy==
Spotswood made headlines briefly in 2000, when teacher Jeff Newton, with the backing of freedom of speech advocacy organizations including the ACLU and American Library Association, went to court over an incident covering several weeks in September 1999, when then principal C. James Slye ordered Newton to remove anticensorship pamphlets from his classroom&#x27;s door that had been posted in observance of Banned Books Week. The pamphlet in question was a list of books that had been challenged or banned in schools, libraries and bookstores around the country during the late 1990s; these books include several revered and widely read American works, such as &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, but also include highly sexualized or &quot;vulgar&quot; books that the US Supreme Court found legal to exclude from public schools in the 1982 case of Board of Education v. Pico. ALA | Challenged and Banned Books The ACLU charged that Spotswood was effectively censoring the anticensorship message of the pamphlet outside of his constitutional rights and blatantly failed to follow the Rockingham County School Board Policy for mediating issues related to controversial and sensitive materials. The suit was dismissed before the case could be heard, when Newton resigned from the district.

<text>Amani Askari Toomer (born September 8, 1974) is an American former professional football player who spent his entire career as a wide receiver and punt returner for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He registered over 1,000 receiving yards each season from 1999 to 2003, was a member of the 2007 Giants team that won Super Bowl XLII, and holds Giants&#x27; club records with 9,497 receiving yards, 668 receptions, and 54 receiving touchdowns. He also returned 109 punts for 1,060 yards and three touchdowns. As a rookie in 1996, he led the NFL with an average of 16.6 yards on 18 punt returns. 

Toomer played college football for the Michigan Wolverines from 1992 to 1995. In 1994, he broke the school&#x27;s single-season record with 1,096 receiving yards and was a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award and a first-team All-Big Ten honoree. Toomer finished his college career ranked second (now fourth) in Michigan history with 2,657 receiving yards.

==Early life==
Toomer was born in Berkeley, California, in 1974. His first name, &quot;Amani&quot;, is Swahili for peace, and his middle name, &quot;Askari&quot;, is Swahili for soldier. Toomer&#x27;s father, Donald Toomer, played college football for Woody Hayes at Ohio State. His uncle is comedian George Wallace. Toomer began playing Pee-Wee Football as a lineman for the Berkeley Cougars and as a receiver, kicker, punter, linebacker, and running back for the Richmond Steelers.

Toomer attended De La Salle High School in Concord, California. As a football player at De La Salle, Toomer was selected as a &quot;Parade&quot; All-American and a &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA player.

==University of Michigan==
Toomer enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1992 and played college football for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1992 to 1995. As a freshman and sophomore in 1992 and 1993, he started only three games (two in 1992 and one in 1993) and was principally used as a backup to the team&#x27;s #1 receiver, Derrick Alexander. Toomer caught 16 passes for 238 yards in 1992 and 29 passes for 565 yards in 1993.

===1994 season===
As a junior in 1994, Toomer did not start any games for Michigan, as Mercury Hayes was the starting flanker in all 12 games. Despite technically being a &quot;backup&quot; to Hayes, Toomer in 1994 broke Jack Clancy&#x27;s single-season Michigan record with 1,096 receiving yards. With Todd Collins at quarterback, Toomer was the 1994 Wolverines&#x27; leading receiver with 54 receptions for 1,096 yards, an average of 20.3 yards per reception. Toomer also finished the season as the Big Ten Conference&#x27;s leading receiver with an average of 93.9 receiving yards per game. He had a career-high 179 receiving yards, including touchdown receptions of 46 and 38 yards, in the Wolverines&#x27; 1994 season-opening victory over Boston College. He also returned a punt 72 yards for a touchdown against Illinois. Toomer was a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award in 1994 and was selected by both the conference coaches and media as a first-team wide receiver on the 1994 All-Big Ten team.

===1995 season===
As a senior, Toomer finally became a starter, starting 12 games at split end for the 1995 Michigan team. However, Toomer was routinely double-teamed in 1995, opening the way for Mercury Hayes to lead the team in both receptions and receiving yardage. Toomer finished the 1995 season with 44 receptions for 758 yards and seven touchdowns. He had his best game of the season in a 52–17 victory over Minnesota, catching five passes for 174 yards and two touchdowns, including a career-long 75-yard touchdown reception from Brian Griese.

===College career overview===
In four seasons at Michigan, Toomer had 124 receptions for 2,144 yards (17.3 per catch) and 12 receiving touchdowns. He finished his college career ranked second (now fourth) in Michigan history with 2,657 receiving yards. Toomer was also used as a punt and kick returner at Michigan. He returned 46 punts for 384 yards (8.3 yards per return) and two touchdowns. He also returned 14 kickoffs for 306 yards (21.9 yards per return).

==Professional football==
===Return specialist: 1996–1998===
Toomer was selected by the New York Giants in the second round (34th overall pick) of the 1996 NFL draft. In July 1996, he signed a three-year contract with the Giants providing a $670,000 signing bonus and salaries of $269,000 in 1996, $336,000 in 1997, and $403,000 in 1998.

In his first three seasons with the Giants, Toomer was principally used as a punt and kickoff returner. In his first NFL game, the opening game of the 1996 season, Toomer set a Giants&#x27; record with an 87-yard punt return for a touchdown against the Buffalo Bills. He returned a second punt for a touchdown that season against the Philadelphia Eagles, before injuring his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and spending the rest of the season on injured reserve. Toomer led the NFL in 1996 with an average of 16.1 yards on 19 punt returns.

During the 1997 season, Toomer appeared in all 16 games for the Giants and returned 47 punts for 455 yards, an average of 9.7 yards per return. He registered his third punt return touchdown. He also caught his first touchdown pass on November 16, 1997, a 56-yard reception from Danny Kanell against the Arizona Cardinals.

In 1998, Toomer again appeared in all 16 games for the Giants. He returned 35 punts for 252 yards, an average of 7.1 yards per return. He also began to see increased playing time as a receiver, registering 27 catches for 360 yards and five touchdowns. In Week 15, in a come-from-behind victory over the previously undefeated Denver Broncos, Toomer caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from Kent Graham with 48 seconds left in the game as the Giants ruined the Broncos&#x27; dream of a perfect season by winning 20–16. Toomer later publicly acknowledged that his slow start as an NFL receiver was the result of exercise-induced asthma which he had hidden for years. After seeking treatment for the condition, his receiving career blossomed in 1999 and 2000.

===Prime years: 1999–2003===
During the 1999 New York Giants season, Toomer became a starting wide receiver in all 16 games. That year, he broke the team record for receptions in a season (79), and his 1,183 receiving yards were the second-highest in team history behind Homer Jones.

In 2000, Toomer appeared in all 16 regular season games (14 as a starter) for the Giants and posted solid totals with 78 receptions for 1,094 yards and seven touchdowns. With Kerry Collins at quarterback, the 2000 Giants team advanced to Super Bowl XXXV (a loss to the Baltimore Ravens), and Toomer started all three postseason games for the team. He totaled 10 catches for 135 yards and a touchdown in the 2000–01 NFL playoffs.

During the 2001 New York Giants season, Toomer appeared in all 16 regular season games, caught more than 70 passes, and gained over 1,000 receiving yards for the third consecutive year.

Toomer had the best year of his NFL career in 2002. He set Giants&#x27; single-season records with 82 receptions and 1,343 receiving yards. His eight receiving touchdowns in 2002 were also a career-high. His total of 204 receiving yards against the Indianapolis Colts was also the highest total for a Giants wide receiver in a 60-minute game (two players had higher receiving totals, but both of those games went to overtime).

In 2003, Toomer started all 16 games and had his fifth consecutive season with at least 1,000 receiving yards. He totaled 63 catches for 1,057 yards and five touchdowns. In the second game of the season, a Monday night game against the Dallas Cowboys, Toomer broke Frank Gifford&#x27;s club record for receiving yardage.

===2004–2006===
The 2004 season marked the first time since Toomer&#x27;s rookie year in which he did not score a touchdown. Toomer appeared in 15 games and had 51 catches for 747 yards, the sixth consecutive season in which he topped 50 catches and 700 yards.

During the 2005 season, the Giants had a new starting quarterback, Eli Manning, who threw for almost 3,800 yards. Plaxico Burress took over as the Giants&#x27; #1 receiver, but Toomer still started all 16 games and had 60 receptions for 684 yards and seven touchdowns. Toomer&#x27;s 2005 highlights included a last-second touchdown reception against the Denver Broncos, a late game-tying touchdown at Seattle, and a fourth-and-goal touchdown catch against the Rams.

Toomer started strongly in the 2006 season. In a Week 2 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he tallied a career-high 12 receptions and scored two touchdowns to help spark a 17-point comeback. Physically exhausted by game&#x27;s end, he had to be carried off the field by trainers. Toomer&#x27;s season came to an end after eight games when he suffered a partially torn ACL in his left knee. In eight games during the 2006 season, Toomer had 32 receptions for 360 yards and three touchdowns. The Giants compiled a 6–2 record in the first half of the season with Toomer in the lineup, but fell to 2–6 in the second half without Toomer. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin noted, &quot;There&#x27;s no question Amani has a very positive effect on Eli.&quot; Quarterback Eli Manning also praised Toomer: &quot;He has a way of being in the right place at the right time.&quot;

===Super Bowl champion: 2007===
During the 2007 season, Toomer returned from his injury to appear in all 16 regular season games for the Giants. He totaled 59 receptions for 760 yards and three touchdowns. On October 21, 2007, in a home game against the San Francisco 49ers, he broke Kyle Rote&#x27;s club record with his 49th career touchdown catch. In the same game, he also broke Tiki Barber&#x27;s team record for career receptions.

The 2007 Giants advanced through the playoffs and won Super Bowl XLII over the previously undefeated New England Patriots. Toomer started all four postseason games for the team and totaled 21 catches for 280 yards and three touchdowns. On January 13, 2008, during the 2007 divisional playoff round, Toomer caught a 52-yard touchdown pass, his longest since a 77-yard touchdown on November 30, 2003. This catch broke the club record for most postseason receptions. Toomer had two touchdown catches in the Giants&#x27; 21–17 upset over the Dallas Cowboys. His first touchdown gave the Giants a 7–0 lead after he caught an 11-yard pass, eluded three would be tacklers, and ran 50 yards for the score. Toomer also led the Giants with six receptions for 84 yards in the Super Bowl. In May 2008, Toomer and the Giants were invited by U.S President George W. Bush to the White House to honor their victory in Super Bowl XLII.

===2008 season and career overview===
The 2008 season was Toomer&#x27;s last in the NFL. He appeared in all 16 regular season games, 12 as a starter, and caught 48 passes for 580 yards and four touchdowns. He concluded his NFL career having appeared in 190 games, 142 as a starter, with 668 receptions for 9,497 yards (14.2 yards per catch), and 54 touchdown receptions. He holds Giants&#x27; record for most career receiving yards, receptions, receiving touchdowns, and most consecutive games with at least one reception (94). In 2010, Toomer was included in the initial group selected for induction into the New York Giants Ring of Honor.

<doc id="1278239" wikidata="Q4697924" url="?curid=1278239" title="Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program Office">
<text>AFMETCAL (Air Force METrology and CALibration Program Office), located in Heath, Ohio is the primary manager of metrology services for the U.S. Air Force. It retains engineering authority for all calibrations performed in the PMEL labs throughout the Air Force, and oversees the contractor managed and operated Air Force Primary Standards Lab (AFPSL). It currently operates as a direct reporting unit of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center for Wright-Patterson AFB, Wright-Patterson, OH.

==Mission==
To develop and sustain precision measurement capabilities ensuring accurate, reliable, and safe air and space systems performance through effective management of the Air Force Metrology Program.

==History==
The United States Air Force calibration program was initiated in January 1952 to comply with AF Regulation 74–2, which outlined policies and assigned responsibilities for managing the Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program. The Dayton Air Force Depot, located at Gentile Air Force Station, Dayton, Ohio, developed and implemented a plan to ensure traceability to national standards that would apply to all measurements made on any weapon system in the Air Force.

The Dayton Air Force Depot was given the authority to establish a centralized calibration program. Under their plan, the Air Materiel Area Depots were given a set of measurement standards, which were periodically calibrated by the Dayton Air Force Depot using standards traceable to the National Bureau of Standards.

The operational success of a &quot;Test Shop&quot; program set up at March AFB, California, on 15 September 1957, led to the establishment of the base-level Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories providing the Air Force with a complete calibration system that could handle the increasingly stringent measurement needs of the new missile and aircraft systems. The Dayton Air Force Depot facilities were becoming inadequate to support the increasing accuracy requirements of the Air Force so the search for a suitable replacement facility was begun in 1958. Air Force Industrial Plant No. 48 at Heath, Ohio, contained most of the features desired, such as the underground facilities and a stable seismic environment. On 1 February 1959, it was redesignated the Heath Maintenance Annex of the Dayton Air Force Depot. Authorization to begin construction was given by public law on 9 June 1960.

The Dayton Air Force Depot personnel associated with the Air Force calibration program began their moves to the Heath Maintenance Annex in April 1962, and by June, most had been relocated to Heath, Ohio. In June, the name was also changed to the 2802nd Inertial Guidance and Calibration Group under HQ Air Force Logisitics Command. By July 1962, the Metrology function was fully staffed. By the end of 1962, the primary calibration labs and the Air Force Measurement Standards Laboratories were completed, consisting of four levels underground containing 20,000 square feet (1900 m2) of laboratory area. In November 1962, the facility was named Newark Air Force Station.

In 1965, the Air Force assigned management of the worldwide Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories certification program to the Calibration and Metrology Division. In 1968, the 2802nd Inertial Guidance and Calibration Group was inactivated and replaced by the Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center (AGMC). The Calibration and Metrology Division was changed to the Directorate of Metrology on 8 November 1968. Newark Air Force Station was renamed Newark Air Force Base in June 1987.

During the 1990s privatization took place at Newark AFB. This has resulted in the functions of the Air Force Primary Standards Laboratories, and Technical Order preparation, being performed by a private contractor. The Air Force created the Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program Office (AFMETCAL) at Heath, Ohio, to manage metrology services for the Air Force, retain engineering authority for all calibrations performed in the PMEL labs throughout the Air Force, and manage the contractor operated Air Force Primary Standards Lab. This is the present configuration of the Air Force Metrology program.

==Notes==
* Newark Air Force Base was the first base to be targeted by BRAC for privatization. The base was originally targeted for closure. When it was discovered the work there could not be done elsewhere it was only then they tried privatization to correct the BRAC Commissions failure of fact finding.
* AFMETCAL and the AFPSL are located at the Central Ohio Aerospace and Technology Center (COATC), also known as &quot;The Base,&quot; on land leased from the Heath-Newark-Licking County Port Authority.

<text>The String Quartet No. 15 in A minor, Op. 132, by Ludwig van Beethoven, was written in 1825, given its public premiere on November 6 of that year by the Schuppanzigh Quartet and was dedicated to Count Nikolai Galitzin, as were Opp. 127 and 130. The number traditionally assigned to it is based on the order of its publication; it is actually the thirteenth quartet in order of composition. 

==Music==
The five movements of the quartet are:
The performance of the work takes around 45 minutes.

=== I. Assai sostenuto – Allegro ===
The slow introduction to the first movement, like that of the thirteenth quartet, is based on a motif that recurs throughout the late quartets and in the &quot;Große Fuge&quot; as well: the second tetrachord of the harmonic minor scale. The movement is in a modified sonata form which involves three full rotations of the expositional primary and secondary thematic material, each with a different tonal plan, in contrast to the usual sonata form which only cycles fully through this material twice (for the exposition and recapitulation).
The first expositional rotation begins in the tonic and moves down a third to VI (F major) for the second key area (m. 48), while the second – following a developmental episode – is almost a direct transposition that begins in E minor (m. 103) and moves similarly down a third to C major. The final abbreviated rotation (m. 193) remains in the tonic throughout, followed by a coda (m. 232) featuring a dominant pedal point.

The movement&#x27;s unusual structure has invited a variety of analytical interpretations. Composer Roger Sessions describes the form as more of a triple exposition than a normal sonata form, and the second rotation could be interpreted as a simulation of the expositional repeat seen in many classical sonata form expositions, with the added interest of transposition. Conversely, other analysts have interpreted the second rotation as the onset of the recapitulation or as a &quot;double recapitulation effect&quot; rather than as an expositional repeat, with Hepokoski and Darcy describing it as a &quot;tonally &#x27;wrong&#x27; recapitulatory rotation followed by a notably varied, &#x27;right&#x27; one in the tonic&quot;. and Joseph Kerman referring, albeit with reservations, to an &quot;E-minor recapitulation&quot; and an &quot;A-minor recapitulation&quot;.

Charles Rosen, on the other hand, considered this structure to be governed, as all of Beethoven&#x27;s works, by the principle of sonata resolution, pointing to Haydn&#x27;s 75th and 89th symphonies as precedents. For Rosen, the exposition comprises the A minor and F major sections; the brief developmental episode is a true development; and the middle section that directly transposes the exposition is a &quot;harmonic&quot; development (in the dominant and mediant keys, on the sharp side of the tonic) while acting thematically as a recapitulation. This allows the final section to act as a &quot;harmonic&quot; recapitulation (as it remains in the tonic throughout), while incorporating thematic development.

===II. Allegro ma non tanto===

The second movement is a minuet with trio, rather than the scherzo with repeated trio that Beethoven used most often in his works starting with his second symphony. The trio evokes a musette with its melodies over sustained tonic (here, A) tones. It partly reuses Beethoven&#x27;s Allemande WoO 81.

To begin this movement (), Beethoven exposes the fourth in a three-note gesture (G–A–C) four times, with the violins and viola in unison and the cello an octave below. In m. 5, this motive is combined with an inverted variation (outlining a descending fifth) in mixed rhythm.

Philip Radcliffe (1965, p. 114) says that the three-note gesture shares with the opening of the first movement “the unusual feature of beginning on the leading note of the scale.” Daniel Chua (1995, p. 113) points out that this creates “rhythmic ambivalence”, especially when the two motives combine in bar 5: “In this way, as the two patterns interlock a gentle tension is induced by the differing rhythmic currents and admits the possibility of two contradictory metrical interpretations.”

The trio adds to parts of his Alemande WoO 81 (also in A major) an A pedal note (first on the first violin and then on the other instruments) that creates a sound atmosphere reminiscent of old or popular music played on bagpipes or hurdy-gurdies.

=== III. Molto adagio – Andante ===

At about 15 to 20 minutes in duration, the third movement is the longest of the quartet. Formally described, it alternates slow sections in a modal F with faster sections, &quot;Neue Kraft fühlend&quot; (&quot;feeling new strength&quot;), in D. The slow sections each have two elements, (1) a passage reminiscent of the opening of the first movement in which the instruments overlap each other with a brief motive; (2) a chorale, the actual song. In the three instances of the slow section, the overlapping motives become increasingly complex rhythmically, while the chorale is pared down, and the two elements become increasingly integrated. There is a characteristic intensification of the head-motif toward the end of the movement.

Beethoven wrote this piece after recovering from a serious intestinal illness which he had feared would be fatal because it afflicted him for the entire winter of 1824–5. He thus headed the third movement with the words, &quot;Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit, in der lydischen Tonart&quot; (&quot;Holy song of thanksgiving of a convalescent to the Deity, in the Lydian mode&quot;).

===IV. Alla marcia, assai vivace===
This brief (2-minute) march in A major leads directly into the rondo-finale through a recitative-like passage.

===V. Allegro appassionato===

The movement is in sonata rondo form (A B A C A B A).
Beethoven&#x27;s sketches show that this theme was originally meant for an instrumental conclusion to the Ninth Symphony, but was abandoned for the now famous choral ending. The movement ends with a coda in A major.

== Reception ==
Beethoven’s nephew Karl van Beethoven reported about the premiere to his uncle: &quot;The quartet received a lot of applause, it went very well together and Linke played better than ever&quot;. Mark Swed has argued that the quartet represents the &quot;psychology of pain and illness&quot; as it was written after Beethoven had recovered from a painful bowel inflammation.

== Influence ==

Some credit this quartet as T. S. Eliot&#x27;s impetus to write the &quot;Four Quartets&quot;; certainly he was recorded in a letter to Stephen Spender as having a copy of the A-minor quartet on the gramophone: &#x27;I find it quite inexhaustible to study. There is a sort of heavenly or at least more than human gaiety about some of his later things which one imagines might come to oneself as the fruit of reconciliation and relief after immense suffering; I should like to get something of that into verse before I die.&#x27;

In his novel &quot;Point Counter Point&quot;, Aldous Huxley makes extended reference and description of this quartet in the late chapter concerning the death/suicide of the character Maurice Spandrell. Colm Tóibín&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;The Magician&quot; depicts Thomas Mann’s reflections on his own work, as inspired by listening to this quartet.

<doc id="1278250" wikidata="Q3048651" url="?curid=1278250" title="Knud Holmboe">
<text>Knud Valdemar Gylding Holmboe (22 April 1902 Horsens Denmark – 13 October 1931 Aqaba, Jordan) was a Danish journalist, author and explorer. He converted from Protestantism to Catholicism in 1921, and, after a sojourn in North Africa, ultimately converted to Islam in 1929, changing his name to Ali Ahmed el Gheseiri. 

He is best known for his 1931 book &quot;Desert Encounter&quot; (), which exposed the maltreatment of the population the author had witnessed on his journey through Libya and the atrocities committed by the Italian colonial power. This account is especially valuable for its description of the concentration camps into which Italian colonial powers forced the Bedouin and where &quot;torture, humiliation, and famine&quot; were rife. Holmboe was murdered on his way to Makkah in Aqaba in October 1931. Some suspect that Italian intelligence officials, connected to the regime of Benito Mussolini, conspired in his death.

==Early life and education==
Knud Holmboe was born as the eldest son of a well-known Danish merchant family in Horsens, Jutland. His younger brother, Vagn Holmboe, went on to become a composer. In his late teenage years he became increasingly interested in religion and philosophy, and at the age of twenty, he moved into a monastery in Clervaux/Clerf in northern Luxembourg and he converted to Catholicism in 1921. After finishing an education as a journalist, he started to work for various Danish local papers.

== Career and travels ==
In search of deeper religious knowledge, Holmboe traveled to Morocco in 1924 and became acquainted with Islam. During a meeting with a sheikh, he realized that he belonged to Islam and converted the following year. His first book &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Sea. A Dash by Plane to Seething Morocco&quot; was translated from Danish and published in 1924 by Klinte Publishers. After returning to Denmark, he wrote two books recounting his experiences in Morocco. 

In 1925, he began a journey across the countries of the Middle East (Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Iraq and Persia). In 1927, he travelled through the Balkans and witnessed the mistreatment of the population by Italian troops in Albania. He took a photograph of the hanging of a dissident Catholic priest by Mussolini&#x27;s soldiers in Albania. This picture was published in newspapers around the globe and, along with articles that went public all over Europe, infuriated the Italian authorities.

Back in Denmark, he experienced economic difficulties and in 1928 he ultimately took the decision to leave the country along with his wife Nora and his daughter Aisha who was born earlier that year. He went to Morocco for the second time, settled down with his family and changed his name to &quot;Ali Ahmed el Gheseiri&quot;. Two years later, in 1930, his wife took the decision to return with her child to Denmark. Instead of returning, he took a plan to travel from Morocco across the Sahara to reach Egypt. It was this journey that made him famous. Driving through the desert in a 1929 Chevrolet, he left the beaten track to discover the communities and landscape of the desert. Holmboe was shocked to observe European violence against the indigenous populations of the North African colonies.

In Libya, he witnessed the shocking treatment of the Libyan Muslim population by Italian colonial troops. Holmboe wrote extensively about what he saw and took photographs as documentation. His activities did not remain unnoticed by the Italians; In the eastern city of Derna, he was arrested and kicked out of Libya. In Egypt, he tried to organize resistance against the Italian colonial power in Libya. However, after the Italian ambassador had informed the British authorities in Egypt, he was arrested again and thrown into prison in Cairo. After a month, he was sent home to Denmark. Back in Denmark, he produced a book in 1931 based on these travel experiences, entitled &quot;Desert Encounter&quot; condemning the colonial regimes of North Africa and particularly the Italian colonial government that terrorized the Muslim population in Libya. The book was published both in Denmark, in many other European countries and the USA, but immediately banned in Fascist Italy. The Italian colonial powers were outraged at the suggestion that the Muslim population of Libya was being subjected to genocide.

== Later life and death ==
After completing his book, he started on his hajj, to Makkah in May 1931. Holmboe bought a camel in Amman and travelled to Aqaba (in modern Jordan) where he waited for an entry permit into Ibn Saud’s territory. On 11 October 1931, he left on his camel towards the Saudi Arabian border spending the night in the vicinity of the Haql oasis. The next day he was attacked by a local Bedouin tribe on the road between al-Haql and Humayda. He managed to escape overnight, but was found the next day and shot on 13 October 1931. The circumstances of his death were never fully explained. While it has been speculated that Italian intelligence ordered the murder, this claim has never been verified.

<doc id="1278256" wikidata="Q2858803" url="?curid=1278256" title="Capital punishment in New Hampshire">
<text>[[Capital punishment]] was abolished in 2019 in [[New Hampshire]] for persons convicted of capital murder. It remains a legal penalty for crimes committed prior to May 30, 2019.

On May 30, 2019, the New Hampshire Senate voted 16–8 to override Governor Chris Sununu&#x27;s veto of House Bill 455, which changed the punishment of capital murder from capital punishment to life in prison. Earlier, on April 26, the New Hampshire House of Representatives had voted 247–123 to override the veto. In both chambers, the measure to override the governor&#x27;s veto passed by a single vote to secure the two thirds majority required. New Hampshire was the last state in New England to allow capital punishment by law, and was the 21st state to abolish capital punishment.

The abolition of capital punishment did not affect Michael K. Addison, who was sentenced to death in 2008 for the 2006 murder of Michael Briggs, a Manchester police officer. Addison is the only person on death row in New Hampshire; the new law does not apply retroactively to his case.

The primary method was lethal injection, with hanging as a secondary method if lethal injection was deemed &quot;impractical&quot; by the State Commissioner of Corrections. New Hampshire (dating back to 1739, before it was a U.S. state) carried out 24 executions for capital punishment, most recently in July 1939, with the execution of Howard Long.

== Status prior to 2019 ==
=== Legal process ===
When the prosecution chose to seek the death penalty, the sentence was decided by the jury and had to be unanimous.

In the case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence was issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there was no retrial).

The governor has the power of clemency with respect to death sentences, with advice of the executive council.

===Capital murder===
Capital murder was the only crime for which people, who were convicted prior to May 30, 2019, could be executed in the state. With the abolishment of the death penalty on May 30, only the sentence of death was replaced by mandatory life in prison. A person is guilty of capital murder if they knowingly caused the death of:
#A sheriff or deputy sheriff, state trooper, constable or police officer of a city or town, correctional officer, probation-parole officer, conservation officer, judge or similar person, state or local prosecutor acting in the line of duty or in retaliation for their job. 
#Another before, after, while engaged or attempting to commit a kidnapping.
#Another after conspiring with a third to commit a contract killing.
#Another after being sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. 
#Another before, after, while engaged or attempting to commit aggravated felonious sexual assault.
#Another before, after, while engaged in the commission of, or while attempting to commit robbery.
#Another before, after, while engaged or attempting to commit a drug offense.

Since the state&#x27;s execution of Howard Long on July 14, 1939, eight people have been charged with capital murder. Three were convicted but received a mandatory life imprisonment without parole sentence. In three other cases, capital murder charges were resolved before trial, twice because the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled the law authorizing the death penalty to be unconstitutional.

===Methods===
After a person was convicted of capital murder, a separate penalty phase was carried out using the same jury. The jury weighed a variety of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. If a person had been convicted of capital murder and was not sentenced to death, the mandatory sentence was life imprisonment without possibility of parole (LWOP), the same sentence as for first-degree murder.

Executions must be carried out no sooner than one year after the sentencing. Death row for men and the execution are at the New Hampshire State Prison for Men at Concord. According to state law:

The punishment of death shall be inflicted by continuous, intravenous administration of a lethal quantity of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic agent…

It was also possible for executions to be carried out by hanging. If it was found:

…to be impractical to carry out the punishment of death by administration of the required lethal substance or substances, the sentence of death may be carried out by hanging…

===Public opinion===
In a 2008 poll conducted for the &quot;Concord Monitor&quot;, 57 percent of likely voters supported the death penalty in police killing cases, 39 percent favored life in prison without parole, and 4 percent were unsure.

==Earlier history==
From 1734 to 1939, 24 people were executed in the state for capital murder.

===1739–1942===
*In 1739, two women were the first convicts to be executed in the state, both convicted of &quot;feloniously concealing the death of a ... infant bastard child&quot;. Provincial laws at the time required capital punishment for murder, rape, homosexual acts, abortion, bestiality, burglary, counterfeiting and treason.
*On May 8, 1755, Eliphaz Dow became the first man to be executed in New Hampshire. He was executed in Portsmouth for murder.
*In 1796, Thomas Powers, an African American, was hanged for rape. He was the first black person to be executed in the state.
*On January 3, 1822, Daniel Davis Farmer was hanged in Amherst for the murder of Ann Ayer in Goffstown in April 1821.
*In 1868, hangings were moved to the State Prison in Concord, after a riot followed the execution of Samuel Mills on the main street of Woodsville. Prior to the 1868 execution, hangings were carried out in public.
*In 1903, the punishment for murder in the first degree was changed from death, to death or imprisonment for life as the jury may determine... If the jury shall find the respondent guilty of murder in the first degree, the punishment shall be life imprisonment unless the jury shall add to their verdict the words, with capital punishment.
*In 1939, Howard Long, a storekeeper from Alton, Long was hanged at the New Hampshire State Prison in Concord on July 14, 1939, for molesting and fatally beating 10-year-old Mark Neville Jensen, from Laconia.
*In 1949, Ralph Jennings, a black man, was sentenced to be hanged for the murder of New Jersey nanny Ruth Eisenberg. Her body was found by hunters on a dirt road with panties shoved down her mouth along with a watch. Jennings was not executed but committed suicide in his cell by hanging himself. Jennings was convicted after a jury trial in Carroll County. The provided evidence insinuated it was a sex crime/homicide. The case became a national sensation and newspapers called Jennings a sex-murderer. Medical testimony stated the cause of death was asphyxiation.

===&quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; (1972)===
In 1959, Frederick Martineau and Russell Nelson were convicted of murdering a businessman in a Nashua parking lot, who was scheduled to testify in a Rhode Island burglary case.

Martineau and Nelson received 13 stays of execution. They were spared the death penalty in 1972 when the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, that &quot;unitary trial&quot; procedure, in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment, was in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

===1970–present===
*In 1971, the state legislature enacted RSA 630:1 Capital Murder. In 1977, RSA 630:1 III was amended by the legislature so that a person convicted of a capital murder &quot;may&quot; be punished by death, instead of &quot;shall be&quot; punished by death. In 1988, killing another after being sentenced to life imprisonment without parole pursuant was added to RSA 630:1. Also, probation-parole officer was added to the list of law enforcement officers contained in Paragraph II of the statute.
*In 1990, causing the death of another before, after, while engaged or attempting to commit aggravated felonious sexual assault, or an offense punishable under RSA 318-B:26, I(a) or (b) of the Controlled Drug Act was added as an aggravating element that might cause a crime to be classified as capital murder. In 1994, killing a &quot;judicial officer&quot; was added to the criteria for capital murder, and retaliation for a person&#x27;s actions in the line of duty was added.
*In 1992, the New Hampshire State Prison dismantled its gallows.
*In 2000, Governor Jeanne Shaheen vetoed legislation to abolish the death penalty. The act had passed the House of Representatives 191-163 and the Senate 14–10. A two-thirds majority to overturn the veto was not achieved.
*In 2004, Governor Craig Benson vetoed legislation that would have raised the minimum age to execute someone from 17 to 18. Benson said:

When somebody, regardless of their age, is bold enough to take the life of a police officer, there should be no exceptions — we should make sure that they should pay the ultimate price. So I&#x27;m going to make a pledge as governor that if anyone takes the life of a police officer, I will seek the death penalty.

*In 2006, the statutory minimum age for a person punishable by death was raised from 17 to 18 years. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; (2005), that it is unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on people who were under age of 18 when they committed a capital crime. It noted that science has demonstrated the brains of minors are still unformed, and that it constituted &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; to sentence them as adults.
*In 2009, Representative Stephen Linsey introduced House Bill 556, to repeal the death penalty. The bill was suggested &quot;Inexpedient to Legislate&quot; by the House Judicial Committee. It passed the House by a narrow margin, but failed to pass the Senate, where the vote was tied 12-12.
*In 2018, the New Hampshire State Senate and House both passed Senate Bill 593, which would prospectively abolish the death penalty but not apply retroactively to those already on death row. Governor Chris Sununu vetoed the bill on June 21, 2018, and an override attempt was defeated on September 13, 2018.
*In 2019, the New Hampshire State Senate and House passed another repeal bill, HB 455, this time with veto-proof majorities. Nevertheless, Governor Sununu again vetoed the bill on May 3, 2019. The veto was overridden on May 30, 2019. New Hampshire was the last New England state to outlaw the death penalty.

<text>Konsta Viljami Jylhä (14 August 1910 Kaustinen – 13 September 1984 Kokkola) was a folk-virtuoso who, in Finnish fiddling, made the traditional &quot;pelimanni-style&quot; folk music a Finnish cultural phenomenon of wider currency, bringing his natural genius and traditional style to a burgeoning nationwide television audience, thus laying the foundation for a rich and popular traditional music scene in Finland.

A third generation Central Ostrobothnian &quot;master pelimanni&quot; (Mestaripelimanni); in the 1960s Jylhä&#x27;s band Konsta Jylhä ja Purppuripelimannit became a mainstay of the Kaustinen Folk Music Festival, and iconic both in popular culture, and within the generation of master pelimanni to follow in his footsteps.

His best known pieces of original composition are &quot;Konstan Parempi Valssi&quot; (&quot;Konsta&#x27;s Major Waltz&quot;) and especially the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Vaiennut Viulu&quot; (&quot;Mute Violin&quot;).

After being battered by a severe head injury suffered in a logging accident in 1961 and some heart attacks suffered since 1962, he became a born-again Christian. During his later years he composed spiritual songs.

<doc id="1278286" wikidata="Q1155881" url="?curid=1278286" title="CNET Download">
<text>CNET Download (originally Download.com) is an Internet download directory website launched in 1996 as a part of CNET. Initially it resided on the domain &quot;download.com&quot;, and then &quot;download.com.com&quot; for a while, and is now &quot;download.cnet.com&quot;. The domain &quot;download.com&quot; attracted at least 113 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study.

==Overview==
The offered content is available in four major categories: &quot;software&quot; (including Windows, Mac and mobile), &quot;music&quot;, &quot;games&quot;, and &quot;videos&quot;, offered for download via FTP from Download.com&#x27;s servers or third-party servers. Videos are streams (at present) and music was all free MP3 downloads, or occasionally rights-managed WMAs or streams until it was replaced with last.fm.

The Software section includes over 100,000 freeware, shareware, and try-first downloads. Downloads are often rated and reviewed by editors and contain a summary of the file from the software publisher. Registered users may also write reviews and rate the product. Software publishers are permitted to distribute their titles via CNET&#x27;s Upload.com site for free, or for a fee structure that offers enhancements.

Up until 2015 CNet used Spigot Inc to monetize the traffic to download.com. According to Sean Murphy, then a General Manager at CNet, &quot;Spigot continues to be a great partner to Download.com, sharing our desire to balance customer experience with revenue.&quot;

==Malware distribution==
In August 2011, Download.com introduced an installation manager called CNET TechTracker for delivering many of the software titles from its catalog. This installer included trojans and bloatware, such as toolbars. CNET admitted in their download FAQ that &quot;a small number of security publishers have flagged the Installer as adware or a potentially unwanted application&quot;.

In December 2011, Gordon Lyon, writing under his pseudonym &quot;Fyodor&quot; wrote of his strong dislike of the installation manager and the bundled software. His post was very popular on social networks, and was reported by a few dozen media. The main problem is the confusion between the content offered on Download.com and the software offered by the original authors; the accusations included deception as well as copyright and trademark violation.

In 2014, The Register and US-CERT warned that via download.com&#x27;s &quot;foistware&quot;, an &quot;attacker may be able to download and execute arbitrary code&quot;. In 2015, research by :Emsisoft suggested that all free download portals bundled their downloads with potentially unwanted software, and that Download.com was the worst offender.

A study done by How-To Geek in 2015 revealed that Download.com was packaging malware inside their installers. The test was done in a virtual machine where the testers downloaded the Top 10 apps. These all contained crapware/malware; one example was the KMPlayer installer, which installed a rogue antivirus named &#x27;Pro PC Cleaner&#x27; and attempted to execute codice_1. Some downloads, specifically YTD, were completely blocked by Avast.

Another study done by How-To Geek in 2015 revealed that Download.com was installing fake SSL certificates inside their installers, similar to the Lenovo Superfish certificate. These fake certificates can completely compromise SSL encryption and allow man-in-the-middle attacks.

However, in July 2016, How-To Geek discovered that Download.com no longer included adware/malware in its downloads and that its Installer program had been discontinued.

<text>Moerzeke is a village located at the river Scheldt in the municipality of Hamme, Belgium.

==History==
The name comes from the Gallo-Roman &quot;Mauriciacum&quot;, which means &quot;good or villa belonging to Mauricius&quot;. In the passing ages the name Moerzeke has been written in various ways. In Latin manuscripts from 1125 and 1156 you can read &quot;Murzeke&quot; and &quot;Murceke&quot;, in 1171 &quot;Morzeka&quot;, in 1225 &quot;Morsca&quot;, in 1259 and 1261 &quot;Morseke&quot;, in 1330 &quot;Mourseka&quot;. At the end of the sixteenth century Mercator indicates Moerzeke as &quot;Moeshe&quot; on his maps. This name is still used by the people of Moerzeke.

The village has a history of disasters. In 1488 the castle of the lord of Moerzeke was ruined by troublemakers from Ghent. The church was plundered too, but the inhabitants of Moerzeke had moved the most valuable pieces of their church to Dendermonde. Reformation brought a lot of mayhem: half the parish got burned down and ravaged and even the church didn&#x27;t escape this. From 1578 on the Catholic religion was prohibited, violation resulted in the death penalty. In 1580 the Black Death broke out, which nearly killed the total population of Moerzeke. In 1584 after a siege that lasted for 20 days Moerzeke and Dendermonde were liberated from the Protestants by the Spanish troops. In 1590 a priest from Hulst (the Netherlands) came to Moerzeke together with some seventy families from Verrebroek and Kieldrecht to bring the population to a normal level again.

This was not yet the end of misery in Moerzeke however. In 1846-1848 the harvest largely failed, which caused poverty and the death of many. Moerzeke also has had several dam-breaks causing floods.

==Sites==
Moerzeke holds the burial chapel and associated museum of Father Edward Poppe, who was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1999. These have grown into places of pilgrimage.

<doc id="1278298" wikidata="Q559874" url="?curid=1278298" title="Publius Pomponius Secundus">
<text>Publius Pomponius Secundus was a distinguished statesman and poet in the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius. He was suffect consul for the &quot;nundinium&quot; of January to June 44, succeeding the ordinary consul Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus and as the colleague of the other ordinary consul, Titus Statilius Taurus. Publius was on intimate terms with the elder Pliny, who wrote a biography of him, now lost.

==Name==
His full name was Publius Calvisius Sabinus Pomponius Secundus, as indicated by two fragmentary inscriptions from Germania Superior. For some time, Pomponius&#x27; praenomen was uncertain; &quot;Publius&quot; was not a regular name of the Pompilii, and Olli Salomies discusses the possibility that it might have been Gaius, but notes that a Publius Calvisius Sabinus was attested as existing in Spoletium, and concludes that it is &quot;possible to assume with some confidence&quot; that he had been adopted by a Publius Calvisius Sabinus. That his praenomen was &quot;Publius&quot;, at least after his adoption, seems to be confirmed by an inscription from Veii, dating from his consulship, another from Cyrenae, when he was proconsul, and a third from Mogontiacum, when he was &quot;Legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;.

==Family==
Pomponius&#x27; mother was Vistilia, who by other marriages was the mother of Publius Suillius Rufus and the general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. The name of his father is not known, but Ronald Syme has suggested he could be either Gaius Pomponius Graecinus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 16, or his brother, Lucius Pomponius Flaccus, consul &quot;ordinarius&quot; in 17. Pomponius&#x27; brother, Quintus Pomponius Secundus, was involved in various intrigues during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius. Quintus tried to protect his brother from Tiberius&#x27; displeasure.

==Political career==
Pomponius was a friend of Sejanus, who served as consul in 31. Upon the latter&#x27;s denunciation and execution in October of that year, mobs hunted down and killed anyone they could link to Sejanus. Pomponius was placed under house arrest by Tiberius, where he remained until 37.

Tiberius died in 37, and his successor Caligula promptly released Pomponius from prison and appointed him as governor of the senatorial province of Creta et Cyrenaica. Caligula married Caesonia, Pomponius&#x27; half-sister, in 40, but he was assassinated in late January 41.

Upon Caligula&#x27;s death, Claudius appointed Pomponius&#x27; brother, Quintus Pomponius Secundus as consul (Caligula had been Consul of Rome, as well as emperor, at the time of his assassination). Pomponius himself, who was still serving as governor of Creta et Cyrenaica province, served also as consul from January until June of 44.

Pomponius continued to serve as governor of the Creta et Cyrenaica until 50, at which time Claudius appointed him as governor and &quot;legatus&quot; of Germania Superior. In 50, Pomponius led the Roman legions to victory against the Chatti and freed the survivors of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest after forty years of slavery. For this, he was decreed the honour of a &quot;ornamenta triumphalia&quot;. He served as governor of Germania Superior until 54. This was the final mention of Pomponius in the historical record, except by the Plinies.

==Writings==
It was by his tragedies that Secundus obtained the most celebrity. They are spoken of in the highest terms by Tacitus, Quintilian, and the younger Pliny, and were read even in a much later age, as one of them is quoted by the grammarian Charisius. These tragedies were first put on the stage in the time of Claudius. Quintilian asserts that he was far superior to any writer of tragedies he had known, and Tacitus expresses a high opinion of his literary abilities.

Secundus devoted much attention to the niceties of grammar and style, on which he was recognized as an authority. His subject matter was Greek, with one known exception, a &quot;praetexta&quot; called &quot;Aeneas&quot;. Tragedians in the Julio-Claudian and Flavian periods typically were men of relatively high social status, and their works often expressed their political views under an insufficient veil of fiction. Only a few lines of his work remain, some of which belong to &quot;Aeneas&quot;.

<text>Michael A. Bennett (born August 13, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Wisconsin Badgers. He was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft with the 27th overall pick. A Pro Bowl selection with the Vikings in 2002, Bennett was also a member of the New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, San Diego Chargers, and Oakland Raiders.

==Early life==
Bennett attended Milwaukee Trade and Technical High School. As a senior, he was ranked the top football player in the state, and was an All-State selection.

==College career==
Bennett attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison and was a standout in football and in track as a sprinter. He spent two years as a backup to Ron Dayne, but, as a junior, Bennett rushed for 1,592 yards and scored ten touchdowns, despite missing two games due to injury.

===Track and field===
As a junior at the 1997 state track meet, Bennett set records in the 100 meter and 200 meter dashes, then broke both records as a senior in 1998. Both his 100m time of 10.33 seconds and 200m time of 20.68 seconds still stand as state records as of 2024.

====Personal bests====
==Professional career==
===Minnesota Vikings===
Bennett was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round (27th overall) of the 2001 NFL draft. As a rookie in 2001, he was thrust into a starting role after the sudden retirement of star running back Robert Smith. In 2002, Bennett rushed for 1,296 yards and added 351 yards receiving on his way to the Pro Bowl. However, his career stalled due to injuries the following year.

The Vikings released Bennett at the conclusion of the 2005 NFL season.

===New Orleans Saints===
Bennett was signed by the New Orleans Saints to serve as the backup to Deuce McAllister. After the addition of Reggie Bush in the 2006 NFL draft, Bennett became expendable and was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a fourth round draft choice.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
Bennett spent the 2006 season and part of the 2007 season with the Kansas City Chiefs. He played in 17 games for the Chiefs in all, carrying the ball 56 times for 252 yards and no touchdowns. He was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers just over a month in the 2007 season.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
On October 16, 2007, the Buccaneers acquired Bennett from the Chiefs after injuries to running backs Carnell Williams and Michael Pittman. His first touchdown as a Buccaneer came in Week 8 of the 2007 season against the Jacksonville Jaguars off a 19-yard swing pass run.

On February 15, 2008, Bennett re-signed with the Buccaneers in lieu of becoming an unrestricted free agent. Bennett was released on November 11 when Carnell Williams was activated from the PUP list.

===San Diego Chargers===
Bennett was claimed off waivers by the San Diego Chargers on November 12, 2008. The team released linebacker Derek Smith to make room for him on the roster. He was released on March 4, 2010. During the 2009 season with San Diego, Bennett played in six games, rushing 23 times for 65 yards, and catching six passes for 65 yards.

===Oakland Raiders===
Bennett signed with the Oakland Raiders on May 6, 2010. He was released on September 5, 2011. During the 2010 season with Oakland, he gained 11 yards rushing and nine yards receiving while playing in seven games.

<text>Eforie (; historical names (for Eforie Sud): &quot;Băile Movilă&quot;, &quot;Carmen-Sylva&quot;, &quot;Vasile Roaită&quot;) is a town and a holiday resort on the Black Sea shore, in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, Romania. It is located about south of Constanța. Techirghiol Lake lies nearby.

== History ==
Eforie Sud, the southern part of the town, was founded by the aristocrat Ion Movilă in 1899, when he erected a hotel named &quot;Băile Movilă&quot; (Movilă Spa). In 1928, the spa was renamed &quot;Carmen-Sylva&quot;, after the pen name of Queen Elisabeth of Romania. In 1950, after the establishment of the Communist regime, the name of the city was changed again to &quot;Vasile Roaită&quot; to honor a railway worker shot dead during the Grivița strike of 1933. In 1962, the city was renamed yet again to Eforie Sud.

In 1966, the city of Eforie was created by merging Eforie Sud with the northern resort Eforie Nord. Formally, the city is composed of Eforie Sud, the administrative centre, and Eforie Nord, a dependent village. Many other hotels were built here over the years, most of them during the communist regime.

== Education ==
&quot;Carmen Sylva&quot; High School is the city&#x27;s only high school (located in Eforie Sud, which also has a general school, while another general school is located in Eforie Nord).

== Sports ==
Besides many summer sports, as beach football, there is a football club named CS Eforie, playing in Liga III.

==Natives==
*Andreea Bănică (born 1978), singer and songwriter

<doc id="1278323" wikidata="Q2517745" url="?curid=1278323" title="Will They Ever Trust Us Again?">
<text>Will They Ever Trust Us Again? is a supplementary book by Michael Moore published after his documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was in theaters and released on DVD. The film proved to be the most successful documentary of all time, grossing over 120 million dollars in the United States alone. The book&#x27;s title refers to a line near the end of the movie where Moore questions if the enlisted personnel in the military will ever trust the government again for sending them into a war that was not needed.

Unlike Moore&#x27;s other books, the contents consist almost completely of letters and e-mail that Moore has received from people in the military and their families, many expressing outrage at George W. Bush for sending them to Iraq, descriptions of the horrors of war, remorse about the killing and destruction wrought on Iraqi civilians, worry about loved ones, and disillusionment with the military and politics. Moore writes in the book&#x27;s introduction, &quot;What makes these comments unique and so intense is the fact that they are not the words of the Left or the rhetoric of the antiwar movement — they &quot;are&quot; the war movement.&quot;

Moore also provides additional comments and samples from his book on his official website.

<text>Corey Lamonte Chavous (; born January 5, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive back for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Chavous played for three teams at both safety and cornerback. Chavous was known as one of the most instinctive defensive backs of his era and was a Pro Bowl selection in 2003. He is the founder of the media company and website DraftNastyMagazine.com, which specializes in coverage of the major sports with an emphasis on scouting and professional drafts. He is currently a color analyst for college football games as well as an NFL draft analyst for CBS Sports.

==Early life==
Chavous attended Silver Bluff High School in Aiken, South Carolina. In football, he was an All-Area, and an All-District pick, and in track, he was an All-State choice and was part of a 4 × 100 relay team which won the state title. He was a high school teammate of former Chicago Bears and Vikings wide receiver D&#x27;Wayne Bates.

==College career==
Chavous attended Vanderbilt University. He finished his career with 12 interceptions (which ranks sixth on the school&#x27;s all-time list), made 199 tackles, and batted down 31 passes. He graduated with a degree in human and organizational development.

==Professional career==

===Arizona Cardinals===
Chavous was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the second round (33rd overall) in the 1998 NFL draft. In his rookie season he played in 16 games, starting five, recording 28 tackles and two interceptions, his first coming at the Kansas City Chiefs on November 30. During the team&#x27;s 1999 NFC Wildcard playoff 20–7 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, Chavous notched five tackles and six passes defensed. In 1999, he played in 15 games recording 40 tackles and one interception. The following year, he made 48 tackles and one interception.

In 2003, he made 86 tackles, a career-high eight interceptions and one touchdown. His performances that season earned him a trip to the 2004 Pro Bowl. The following year, he made 81 tackles and one interception. In his final season with the Vikings, Chavous started all 16 games for a fourth straight season, recording 71 tackles and two interceptions.

===St. Louis Rams===

<doc id="1278342" wikidata="Q35162" url="?curid=1278342" title="Koasati language">
<text>Koasati (also Coushatta) is a Native American language of Muskogean origin. The language is spoken by the Coushatta people, most of whom live in Allen Parish north of the town of Elton, Louisiana, though a smaller number share a reservation near Livingston, Texas, with the Alabama people. In 1991, linguist Geoffrey Kimball estimated the number of speakers of the language at around 400 people, of whom approximately 350 live in Louisiana. The exact number of current speakers is unclear, but Coushatta Tribe officials claim that most tribe members over 20 speak Koasati. In 2007, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, in collaboration with McNeese State University and the College of William and Mary, began the Koasati (Coushatta) Language Project as a part of broader language revitalization efforts with National Science Foundation grant money under the Documenting Endangered Languages program.

Koasati is most closely related to the Alabama language but, though the Coushatta and Alabama have historically lived near each other, their languages are no longer mutually intelligible without extensive exposure. The language is also related to the Mikasuki language; some native speakers of Coushatta report they can understand Mikasuki without previous exposure to the language.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Koasati has three vowels, all of which occur as short and long and can be nasalized. The following chart is based on Kimball&#x27;s work. Kimball describes what is normally the close-mid back vowel /o/ as &quot;high back&quot; vowel, hence its placement in the chart below. He notes that /o/ sometimes has the allophone [u] and is raised to [ʊ] in closed word-final syllables.

In 2007, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana developed and approved its own orthographic system. In this system, long vowels are written by doubling the vowel (e.g., [aː] as &quot;aa&quot;), and nasalized vowels are underlined (e.g., [õ] or [ǫ] as &quot;o̱&quot;).

Vowel length in Koasati can be contrastive. For example, vowel length distinguishes meaning for &quot;palana&quot; &quot;bean&quot; and &quot;palaana&quot; &quot;plate&quot;, as well as &quot;choba&quot; &quot;big&quot; and &quot;chooba&quot; &quot;horse&quot;. Vowel nasalization most often occurs word-finally as a phrase-terminal marker. In Koasati, the end of a phrase is basically marked by either deletion of the final unaccented vowel or the nasalization of the final vowel when deleting it would eliminate phonological information relevant to the phrase&#x27;s meaning. For example, the final vowel in &quot;hopoonilaho̱&quot; &quot;he/she will cook it&quot; is nasalized instead of deleted, and therefore is distinguished from the more emphatic &quot;hopoonilaha̱&quot;, where the irrealis future suffix -&quot;laha&quot;- indicates that the action will certainly occur, whereas the irrealis future suffix -&quot;laho&quot;- does not provide such certainty.

===Consonants===
Koasati has the consonants given in the table below, based on Geoffrey Kimball&#x27;s work. IPA transcriptions occur in brackets when different from the orthography provided by Kimball.
Not included in this chart is a glottal glide (marked &quot;꞉&quot;) that Kimball uses in his own consonant chart, presumably to represent the lengthened vowel sounds of Koasati. In the Tribe&#x27;s official orthography, the is represented by and the is represented by , with no distinction for aspiration. Additionally, Kimball notes that and are aspirated in initial and medial positions. However, the website for the Koasati Language Project explicitly states that these consonants are never aspirated. The occurs most often before , as in &quot;river&quot;, spelled in the official orthography, thereby distinguished from &quot;tail&quot;.

===Syllable structure===
Koasati has both light (CV, VC, V) and heavy (CVC) syllables. Consonant clusters occur across syllables but not within. All monomorphemic Koasati words end in light syllables, while the penultimate syllable can be light but is usually heavy, and it is usually preceded by one or more light syllables, as with the construction CV.CVC.CV as in the word &quot;holihtá&quot; &quot;fence&quot;. Other shapes, in which one or more heavy syllables precede a heavy penultimate syllable (e.g. CV.CVC.CVC.CV as in &quot;hacokpalpá&quot; &quot;butterfly&quot;), or alternate heavy and light syllables (e.g. CVC.CV.CVC.CV. as in &quot;pa꞉piyá꞉ka&quot; &quot;bridge&quot;), are usually the result of the compounding of two words or a once-productive rule of syncope in which the vowel of every second syllable except the final syllable was deleted. Vowel clusters occur in Koasati, unlike in other Muskogean languages where such clusters are made impossible by metathesis and vowel deletion. These clusters occur in Koasati due to the use of locative prefixes that end in a vowel and class 1A negative transitive verbs since these do not undergo the processes of metathesis and vowel deletion. Clusters beginning with /a꞉/ and /i꞉/ are most frequent, and all clusters are generally spoken with a glottal stop between vowels.

===Tone===
Koasati has low [ ` ], high [ ´ ], and high rising–falling [ ˇ ] pitch accents, as well as a fourth unmarked mid-level tone. All noun roots must have one high-pitch accented syllable. The location of the accent depends on the properties of the penultimate syllable. With a few exceptions, the accent falls on the final syllable unless the penultimate syllable contains a long vowel. These pitch accents can be contrastive, as with &quot;sakihpǫ́&quot; &#x27;It is a mink.&#x27; and &quot;sakíhpǫ&quot; &#x27;It is not air-dried.&#x27;. Pitch placement on verbs is motivated by morphology. Most indicative verbs take the high accent, though a few take the low accent. Intensive verbs take the high rising–falling accent.

===Phonological processes===
*/c/ in Kimball&#x27;s orthography, or /ch/ in the official Tribe orthography, is sometimes realized as [ts] before resonants: cf. &quot;awó yáhci&quot; &quot;it is just like grandpa&quot; is realized as [awó yahtsi].
*In rare cases, /k/ is labialized to [kʷ] before /o/: cf. &quot;akkó&quot; &quot;that&quot; → [akkʷó]
*/s/ has the palatal allophone [š] word-initially before /o/ and intervocalically: cf. &quot;sopátlit&quot; &quot;she cleaned it&quot; → [šopátlit]
*When /s/ occurs both before and after a vowel, the allophone of the first /s/ harmonizes with that of the second. For example, &quot;sóslit&quot; (&#x27;he skinned them&#x27;) is not pronounced [šoslit] but [sóslit].
*Rarely, /s/ can have the allophone [r] when it occurs word-finally: cf. &quot;o꞉támmo꞉s&quot; &quot;it is just sunset&quot; → [o꞉támmo꞉r]
*In the word-final position, /h/ becomes a voiceless continuation of the vowel it follows. This can also occur following vowels in other positions. For example, &quot;iltóhnot&quot; &quot;she worked&quot; becomes [iltóónot].
*/h/ can be voiced to [ɦ], usually before c, as discussed above with [haɦchi].
*/l/ is sometimes realized as /n/, as with &quot;intolihná&quot; &quot;work&quot; → [iltolihná]. Rarely, it is realized as [r] intervocalically.
*The vowel /i/ shifts to [ɪ] in all closed syllables, and /o/ shifts to [ʊ] when it occurs in closed word-final syllables: cf. &quot;hókfit&quot; &quot;she put it on&quot; → [hókfɪt]; &quot;íkbot&quot; &quot;he did not kill it&quot; → [íkbʊt]
*The vowels /i/ and /o/ also rarely have the allophones [ɛ] and [u] respectively, though the underlying reason is unclear: cf. &quot;yilahá&quot; &quot;orange (fruit)&quot; → [yɛlahá]; &quot;solitá꞉wa&quot; &quot;soldier&quot; → [sulitá꞉wa]

==Morphology==
Koasati is a polysynthetic language with fairly extensive verbal prefixing and suffixing.

===Nouns===
Two sets of prefixes mark noun possession in Koasati. The &quot;am&quot;-set generally identifies alienable possession and a relatively small set of kinship terms and body parts, while the &quot;ca&quot;-set identifies inalienable possession and most kinship terms and body parts. These prefixes mark person and number on possessing nouns as follows:

===Verbs===

====Position classes====
Kimball identifies the following position classes for prefixes and suffixes that can be added to Koasati verb roots:
*Prefixes
**Position 1: positive and negative subject prefixes
**Position 2: locative prefix &quot;a-&quot;, or the prefix &quot;ak-&quot; which indicates action on the surface of a person (skin) or thing
**Position 3: locative prefixes
**Position 4: pronominal prefixes (&quot;ca-&quot;)
**Position 5: pronominal prefixes (&quot;am-&quot;)
**Position 6: distributive prefix &quot;ho-/oh-&quot;, iterative prefix &quot;hoho-/ohoh-&quot;
**Position 7: instrumental prefixes
**Position 8: directional prefixes
**Position 9: indefinite nouns &quot;na꞉si-/na꞉s-/nas-&quot; (&#x27;something&#x27;) and &quot;a꞉ti-/a꞉t-/at-/a-&quot; (&#x27;someone&#x27;)
*Root
*Suffixes
**Position 1: adverb
**Position 2: diminutive/intensive
**Position 3: habitual
**Position 4: intention
**Position 5: ability
**Position 6: realis/irrealis
**Position 7: deduction
**Position 8: modality
**Position 9: dubiative
**Position 10: hearsay
**Position 11: auditory
**Position 12: tense
**Position 13: consequence
**Position 14: discourse functions
**Position 15: enclitics

=====Prefixes=====
Unlike its frequently used cognates in other Muskogean languages, the general locative prefix &quot;a&quot;- (Position 2) is falling out of use. Positions 4 and 5 relate to the &quot;am&quot;- and &quot;ca&quot;- sets discussed above with nouns. They contain the direct and indirect object prefixes respectively and are used to cross-reference the direct and indirect objects of verbs, as well as mark possession on nominalized verbs. For example, the Position 5 prefix &quot;ac&quot;- is used to mark possession on the root of the nominalized verb meaning &quot;to photograph&quot; in the following way:

A sampling of verbal prefixes, in this case, specific locative prefixes of Position 3, follows:
*&quot;itta&quot;- &quot;action on the ground; action in fire&quot;
*&quot;o꞉&quot;-/&quot;o꞉w&quot;- &quot;action in water&quot;
*&quot;pa꞉&quot;- &quot;action on a raised, artificial, or non-ground surface&quot;
*&quot;on&quot;- &quot;action on a vertical surface or in a vertical plane&quot;
*&quot;itta&quot;- &quot;action in the middle of something&quot;
*&quot;ibi꞉&quot;- &quot;action on the human face&quot;
*&quot;ico꞉&quot;- &quot;action on or in the human mouth&quot;
*&quot;no꞉&quot;- &quot;action on the human neck&quot;
*&quot;nok&quot;- &quot;action in the human throat&quot;

=====Suffixes=====
Kimball recorded over seventy suffixes to fill the fifteen suffix positions. All but eleven of these suffixes can technically co-occur with all other suffixes that do not occupy the same position class. Kimball provides the following example as a possibility:

In the first word, all units that follow the root -&quot;ilá&quot;- &quot;arrive&quot; are suffixes filling the various position classes.

A sample of suffixes, in this case, Position 5 suffixes of ability, follows:
*-&quot;bá꞉no&quot;- &quot;regularly, occasionally&quot;
*-&quot;bí꞉no&quot;- &quot;reluctantly, shyly&quot;
*-&quot;halpi꞉sa&quot;- &quot;to be able to&quot;
*-&quot;yáhli&quot;- &quot;be obliged to, really&quot;

Kimball notes that of these, only -&quot;halpi꞉sa&quot;- &quot;to be able to&quot; is used frequently.

====Verbal number====
Muskogean languages such as Koasati have a three-way number distinction in their verbs, with singular, dual, and plural forms. Some of these forms are suppletive. For example,

&#x27;To dwell&#x27;, in the first person, with full suppletion (singular &quot;aat,&quot; dual &quot;asw,&quot; plural &quot;is&quot;): 

(The angle braces, , separate the two parts of the root.)

&#x27;To smell&#x27; is non-suppletive &quot;hofn&quot;:

&#x27;To go about&#x27;, partially suppletive (SG/DU &quot;aay,&quot; PL &quot;yomahl&quot;):

&#x27;To run&#x27;, partially suppletive (SG &quot;waliik,&quot; DU/PL &quot;tołk&quot;): 

====Verb grades====
Like other Muskogean languages, Koasati has verb grades, or an ablaut system in which morphological and phonemic changes (in this case infixation and nasalization) can be used to alter the meaning of verb.

=====H-grade=====
In Koasati, the h-grade is used to create a polite imperative as well as to indicate a sequence of actions. To form the imperative, &quot;h&quot; is inserted before the final syllable of the verb root. For example, the verb &quot;óntin&quot; &quot;to come&quot; (singular, dual subject) changes to the imperative &quot;ónhtįh&quot; &quot;Come on over!&quot; with the h-grade (in addition to the delayed imperative suffix marked by the vowel nasalization and final &quot;h&quot;). The use of h-grade to indicate sequence (in addition to the switch-reference marker &quot;-ok&quot;) can be seen below:

With the sequence h-grade, the last verb in the sequence takes on temporal and aspectual affixes, while the preceding verbs take on the h-grade and the appropriate switch-reference marker.

=====N-grade=====
In Koasati, the n-grade is relatively uncommon but is used to add emphasis, roughly meaning &quot;completely&quot; or &quot;to continue&quot; depending on whether the verb used is a verb of state or description or a verb of action. To form the n-grade, the vowel of the verb root&#x27;s penultimate syllable is nasalized and accented. For example:

====Reduplication====
Koasati has both punctual and iterative reduplication for verbs, in which part of the root is repeated to indicate that an action is repeated. With punctual reduplication, the verb&#x27;s initial consonant and vowel (or consonant and &quot;o&quot; if no vowel is present) are copied and inserted before the final syllable of the root. For example, &quot;míslin&quot; &quot;to blink&quot; becomes &quot;mismíhlin&quot; &quot;to flutter the eyelids&quot;. With iterative reduplication, the consonant and vowel of the penultimate syllable of the root are copied and inserted before the final syllable of the root. For example, &quot;molápkan&quot; &quot;to gleam&quot; becomes &quot;molalápkan&quot; &quot;to flash&quot;. The iterative can also be formed using the Position 6 iterative prefixes &quot;ohoh&quot;- and &quot;hoho&quot;-.

====The glottal stop====
The glottal stop [ʔ] is used to form the interrogative by infixing [ʔ] before a verb&#x27;s penultimate syllable. Doing so replaces preceding vowel length (if present) and adds a high pitch accent to the syllables preceding and following the glottal stop. For example, /ishí꞉c/ &quot;you see it&quot; changes to the question /ishíʔcá/ &quot;Do you see it?&quot;.

==Syntax==

===Word order===
Koasati sentences generally follow a subject, object, verb (SOV) pattern. If an indirect object is present, the order is typically subject, indirect object, verb (SIoV). For sentences with both a direct and indirect object, the order is typically subject, object, verb, indirect object (SOVIo), though SIoOV also occurs. Any locatives tend to follow the verb. Because Koasati uses the nominative case, these orders are not rigid - elements can be moved within the sentence for emphasis. Examples of some basic orders follow:

*SOV
*SOVIo
===Case marking===
Koasati is an active–stative language. It has seven cases that can be used across five classes of nouns:
The five noun classes contain the following types of nouns, followed by examples:
*Class I: nouns for animate objects (&quot;ifá&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;)
*Class II: nouns to or in which action can occur (&quot;ó꞉la&quot;, &quot;town&quot;)
*Class III: nouns within or among which action can occur (&quot;í꞉sa&quot;, &quot;house&quot;)
*Class IV: nouns describing an area where action can occur (&quot;caffá&quot;, &quot;field&quot;)
*Class V: personal names, kinship terms (&quot;awó&quot;, &quot;grandfather&quot;)

===Switch-reference===
Koasati has switch-reference marking, in which suffixes indicate whether the subjects of two verbs are co-referent. The suffix &quot;–k&quot; indicates that the subject of the verb that follows is the same as that of the previous verb, while &quot;–n&quot; indicates that the subject is different than that of the previous verb. The suffixes &quot;–ok&quot; and &quot;–on&quot; can also be used in the same way for extra emphasis or &quot;focus&quot;. The switch-reference marker &quot;–p&quot; indicates the introduction of a new topic. An example of each suffix follows:
*&quot;nó꞉ra-k ɫabósli-h bánna-k hí꞉ca-t á꞉ta-toho-꞉li-k akkámmi-tik labósl-á꞉ha-k sam, kí,꞉c-o-t&quot; — &quot;Nora tried to extinguish it, and she kept on watching it, but this being so, she was unable to extinguish it.&quot;
*&quot;athómma-k yomáhli-n calakkí ho-ká꞉ha-hco-k&quot; — &quot;They called the wandering Indians Cherokees.&quot;
*&quot;skólka im-alo, kí, st-o-n mí꞉ta-k im-alósti-tika-p&quot; — &quot;They were not interested in school; however, others were interested in it.&quot;

<doc id="1278352" wikidata="Q3707308" url="?curid=1278352" title="Bud Dajo">
<text>Bud Dajo (; ), is a cinder cone and the second highest point (+600m) in Sulu, a province of the Philippines in the Sulu Archipelago. It is one of the cinder cones that make up the island of Jolo and part of the Jolo Volcanic Group. The extinct volcano is located southeast from the town of Jolo in Sulu. The mountain and adjacent lands were declared as Mount Dajo National Park in 1938. It is a sacred mountain for the locals, and the Tausug people at-large, as well as nearby ethnic groups.

==Physical features==
The cinder cone has an elevation of with a base diameter of . On the summit of the mountain is crater that is breached to the southwest. The other volcanic edifices adjacent to Bud Dajo are: Matanding, located northeast of the Bud Dajo with an elevation of asl; Guimba, east and elevation of asl; and Sungal, southeast which is asl., dangerous volcano.

==Geology==
The basaltic volcanic cone is part of Zamboanga-Sulu volcanic arc.

==Eruptions falsely attributed to the mountain==

===1641===
Two volcanoes falsely attributed to the eruption on January 4, 1641, which engulfed southern Philippines in darkness. Further studies later found the eruption to have come from Mount Melibengoy in Cotabato.

===1897===
The earthquake and subsequent tsunami on September 21, 1897, that devastated the Southern Philippines was believed to be from a submarine eruption therefore excludes Bud Dajo.

==PHIVOLCS monitoring activity==
A short-term monitoring (seismic and visuals) surveys were conducted by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology in 1993 and in 1997 on the mountain. No unusual activities were observed within the vicinity of the volcano.

==Mount Dajo National Park==

The mountain and surrounding areas were declared as a national park by Proclamation No. 261 on February 28, 1938, encompassing of land. Recent reports have shown that the mountain is very deforested with few remaining forest cover usually on the steep ridges. The game refuge is not currently listed as a protected area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

===Fauna===
Some vulnerable and endangered species, not necessarily endemic to the area, but can be found within the Mount Dajo National Park are (from BirdLife International): 
# Grey imperial pigeon (&quot;Ducula pickeringii&quot;), Vulnerable
# Philippine cockatoo or the red-vented cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua haematuropygia&quot;), Critically endangered
# Sulu hornbill (&quot;Anthracoceros montani&quot;), Critically endangered
# Sulu pygmy woodpecker &quot;Dendrocopos ramsayi&quot;, Vulnerable
# Winchell&#x27;s kingfisher or rufous-lored kingfisher (&quot;Todiramphus winchelli&quot;), Vulnerable

==Historical relevance==

Bud Dajo is a sacred mountain for the indigenous peoples of the Sulu archipelago. The mountain was the site of the First Battle of Bud Dajo during the Moro Rebellion of the Philippine–American War in 1906, which culminated in the killing by U.S. forces of over 800-900 villagers, mostly civilians, hiding on the crater of Bud Dajo. The event is known as the Moro Crater Massacre. The barbaric killings committed by the American government, under governor-general Leonard Wood and American president and Republican Theodore Roosevelt, included the murder of hundreds of women and children, whose bodies were photographed by the American soldiers as war trophies. In many of the photographs, the American soldiers smiled in glee as skulls, rotting dismembered limbs and torso, and blown-out heads with punctured cheeks were piled-up around them. When the photographs and numbers of killings were known to the American public, the government at the time received some backlash. In an attempt to cover-up the massacre, the American government branded the historical event as fake news, and when branding didn&#x27;t work, they changed the narrative and explained that the Moros of Bud Dajo were uncivilized, falsely depicting them as war-thirsty beings. In truth, the Moros were just defending their land from colonizers that sought to erase their cultural identities. The American government also justified the killing of women by stating that their soldiers killed them because they wore traditional pants, which made them look like men in the eyes of the soldiers. Although the massacre received backlash from certain parts of the American public, the issue later faded from the American public knowledge and discussion as other issues occurred in their daily lives. The horrific atrocities committed by the Americans during the massacre continue to influence the peoples of the Sulu archipelago today, whose people were obliterated in the name of colonialism and white supremacy, and whose sacred mountain and its spirits were disrespected. In 1911, another similar massacre now called the Second Battle of Bud Dajo was committed by the American government under governor-general Wood and the new American president, another Republican, William Howard Taft, with fewer casualties due to negotiations, where the Moros were forced to leave the sacred ground under American colonial rule. In 1913, the American government under both Wood and Taft launched another similar massacre at Bud Bagsak, another sacred mountain near Bud Dajo.

<text>Albéric Clément (c. 1165 – 3 July 1191) was the first Marshal of France (&quot;Marescallus Franciae&quot;), a position created for him by Philip Augustus in 1185. He also inherited the &quot;seigneurie&quot; of Mez (later Mez-le-Maréchal) in Gâtinais after his father&#x27;s death in 1182.

Albéric was born sometime in the mid-1160s to Robert III Clément and Hersende de Mez, and thus came from a knightly family- the Cléments of Mez. He accompanied Philip on the Third Crusade as Marshal, and distinguished himself at the Siege of Acre in particular, frequently leading the advanced guard into battle.

Albéric is said to have died on 3 July 1191, during an attempted breach of the city&#x27;s walls, with accounts by those such as contemporary poet Ambroise suggesting the Marshal led the charge himself and died on- or close to the Accursed Tower, after swearing that he would either die that day or enter Acre. Some accounts describe Albéric charging the walls with Philip&#x27;s standard in hand and a number of men with him, attempting to scale the walls with a ladder, being pulled up with a grappling hook by the Saracen defenders and isolated from his men by rocks thrown onto the climbing assault party. Other accounts describe the ladder breaking under the weight of the Marshal&#x27;s followers, leaving him alone on the wall. Accounts also go on to describe a defending soldier parading the walls wearing Albéric&#x27;s armour after his death, stopping only when Richard I of England shot the man down.

Albéric had two siblings, one of whom- Henry I Clément- would go on to become Marshal of France himself.

==Duties as Marshal of France==
The title of Marshal of France as awarded to Albéric Clément and his successors did not involve command responsibilities of large armies- Albéric held no official command even at Acre. While military in nature, the position was more concerned with management of the king&#x27;s horses and stables. It was not until the 15th century that the position would move away from managing stables to one with battlefield authority second only to the French sovereign.

<text>William Green (born December 17, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Boston College Eagles, receiving consensus All-American honors in 2001. The Browns chose him in the first round of the 2002 NFL draft and he appeared in 46 games for Cleveland between 2002 and 2005.

==Early life==
Green was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey. His father was a heroin addict who died of AIDS when Green was 13 years old. His mother died of the disease a year later after being infected by his father. After his parents&#x27; deaths, Green was separated from his four siblings.

Green attended Holy Spirit High School in Absecon, New Jersey, where he played for the Holy Spirit Spartans high school football team and received multiple high school All-American honors.

==College career==
Green received an athletic scholarship to attend Boston College, and played for their Eagles football teams from 1998 to 2001. In two years as a starting running back, he compiled over 2,700 yards rushing and 32 touchdowns. He was a first-team All-Big East Conference selection in 2000 and 2001, was honored as the Big East Offensive Player of the Year, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American in 2001, after receiving first-team honors from the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, the Walter Camp Football Foundation, &quot;Football News&quot; and &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot;.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
In the 2002 NFL Draft, Green was a top-rated player. However, two college suspensions for marijuana use hurt his stock on draft day.

Cleveland selected him as 16th overall pick in the first round of the 2002 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 2002, Green appeared in all 16 regular season games and started ten of them, gaining 887 yards and scoring six touchdowns. In a home game with playoff implications versus Atlanta late in the season, Green provided Browns fans with one of the most memorable moments of the new Browns. He ran for a 64-yard touchdown to put the Browns ahead for good in a play known as &quot;Run William Run!&quot; due to radio play by play man Jim Donovan&#x27;s call of the play.

His 2003 season, however, was fraught with turmoil. After a good start with 559 yards, Green was arrested for drunk driving and marijuana possession. Green was also notoriously seen wearing one shoe and one sock during the arrest. The arrest led to a four-game suspension under the league&#x27;s substance abuse policy. While under suspension, Green&#x27;s fiancée, Asia Gray, stabbed him in the back during a domestic dispute. The league extended his suspension through the end of the 2003 season &quot;for treatment purposes.&quot;

In 2004, Green gained 585 yards on the season. On November 14, he was ejected prior to a game with the Pittsburgh Steelers for fighting with linebacker Joey Porter. Around this time, he had disclosed that he was having a child with a woman other than his wife.

His final season in Cleveland was an injury-plagued 2005 campaign where he appeared in eight games and gained only 78 yards. The Browns placed him on injured reserve at the end of training camp in 2006 and reached an injury settlement with Green allowing them to release him.

In March 2008, it was reported that Green would attempt to play in the NFL again after two seasons out of the league. He worked out at his alma mater Boston College&#x27;s Pro Day on March 19, showing up in &quot;great shape,&quot; bench-pressing 225 pounds 25 times and posting a 42-inch vertical leap, and also ran a 4.85 forty yard dash. However, he did not sign a contract.

==Personal life==
Prior to his 2008 NFL comeback attempt, Green became a Christian. He became a motivational speaker at corporate, church, and school events. His speeches are typically about forgiveness and overcoming struggles. In 2012, he became an ordained minister.

He is the father of eight children, seven with his wife, Asia Gray, and one from a previous relationship. All eight children live with him and his wife on a four-acre property in Berlin, New Jersey.

<doc id="1278361" wikidata="Q1759732" url="?curid=1278361" title="Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.">
<text>Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. was an American multinational investment bank founded in 1867 by Abraham Kuhn and his brother-in-law Solomon Loeb. Headed from 1885 onwards by Jacob H. Schiff, Loeb&#x27;s son-in-law, it grew to be one of the most influential investment banks in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, financing America&#x27;s expanding railways and growth companies, including Western Union and Westinghouse, and thereby becoming the principal rival of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.

In the years following Schiff&#x27;s death in 1920, the firm was led by Otto Kahn (died 1934) and Felix Warburg (died 1937), men who had already solidified their roles as Schiff&#x27;s able successors. However, the firm&#x27;s fortunes began to fade following the end of World War II in 1945 - it failed to keep pace with a rapidly changing investment-banking industry, in which Kuhn, Loeb&#x27;s old-world, genteel ways, did not seem to fit; the days of the gentleman-banker had passed.

The firm lost its independence from the Bulge Bracket in 1977 when it merged with Lehman Brothers, creating Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. The combined firm was itself acquired in 1984 by American Express, forming Shearson Lehman/American Express and with that, the &quot;Kuhn, Loeb&quot; name was retired.

==History==
Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. was an investment bank located in New York City. It was founded in 1867, by Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb. Kuhn and Loeb had created a successful merchandising business in Cincinnati, Ohio, when they decided to move east, to New York, to take advantage of the country&#x27;s burgeoning economic expansion. Company records indicate that by the time Kuhn and Loeb established their partnership, they were able to capitalize it at $500,000 (equivalent of about $ million in 2024). On January 1, 1875, Jacob Schiff (1847–1920), Solomon Loeb&#x27;s son-in-law, joined the firm. He eventually became its leader and grew the firm into the second most prestigious investment bank in the United States behind J. Pierpont Morgan&#x27;s J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
The firm grew to prominence during the railroad era in the United States. Americans saw great hope and promise in railroads and investors saw great opportunities to profit. Kuhn, Loeb, like all investment banks, brought capital together with commercial opportunity. Its first meaningful entry into railroad financing was in 1877 when it raised funds for the Chicago and North Western Railroad, and several years later, in 1881, for the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad.

Schiff was instrumental in the reorganization of the Union Pacific in 1897, helping to place the firm on sound financial footing. In 1901, with Kuhn, Loeb&#x27;s financial support, E. H. Harriman famously battled James Jerome Hill and J.P. Morgan to acquire control of the Northern Pacific Railroad.

The firm was long associated with many of America&#x27;s emerging industrial giants, providing financial backing for Westinghouse and Western Union, as well as innovative consumer giants like the Polaroid Corporation. The firm also enjoyed respect as a trusted adviser overseas, providing services to numerous foreign governments, including the governments of Austria, Finland, Mexico and Venezuela.

It also acted as the leading investment house for John D. Rockefeller, through the guidance of his investment adviser, Frederick T. Gates. Rockefeller invested in many syndicates with the bank, including major stakes in the prominent railroad companies, as well as contributing to its consolidation of the Chicago meatpackers, which resulted in the formation of a leading trust. Overseas ventures that Rockefeller also got involved with included the bank&#x27;s loans to the Chinese and Imperial Japanese governments.

The firm also joined a partnership with Rockefeller in 1911 to gain control of the Equitable Trust Company, which was later to merge and become the Chase Bank.

Famous partners of the firm included Otto Kahn, Paul Warburg, Felix Warburg, Mortimer Schiff, Benjamin Buttenwieser, Abraham Wolff, Lewis Strauss, and Sigmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg. 

In its early years, intermarriage among the German-Jewish elite was common. Consequently, the partners of Kuhn, Loeb were closely related by blood and marriage to the partners of J &amp; W Seligman, Speyer &amp; Co., Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Lehman Brothers and other prominent German-Jewish firms. Prior to the Second World War, a particularly close relationship existed between the partners of Kuhn, Loeb and M. M. Warburg &amp; Co. of Hamburg, Germany, through Paul and Felix, who were Kuhn, Loeb partners. Later on, following World War II, their cousin Sigmund Warburg would briefly continue this relationship as a partner and Executive Director of the firm.

The firm&#x27;s fortunes began to fade in the years following World War II. Wall Street was changing and shifting away from relationship banking. Kuhn, Loeb&#x27;s world of gentlemen bankers was gradually being replaced by a more aggressive, transaction-oriented Wall Street, with underwriters entering the trenches and selling securities directly to the public—territory Kuhn, Loeb stubbornly refused to enter. When asked how many people worked at Kuhn, Loeb, one partner famously quipped, &quot;about half&quot;. Such was life at Kuhn, Loeb, resting on its laurels, while Wall Street passed it by.

In 1977, facing a capital crisis, the firm succumbed and merged with Lehman Brothers, to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. Internationally, the merged firms were known as Kuhn Loeb Lehman Brothers Inc., in recognition Kuhn Loeb&#x27;s superior international reputation.

The merger did not, however, prove to be the panacea to what ailed Kuhn, Loeb. Indeed, as detailed more closely in the Lehman Brothers history, a period of bitter internal strife ended in 1984 when the firm sold itself to Shearson/American Express, itself the product of a recent merger between American Express and Sandy Weill&#x27;s, Shearson Loeb Rhoades. The combined firms then dropped the Kuhn, Loeb name and became known as Shearson Lehman/American Express, ending Kuhn, Loeb&#x27;s almost 120 years on Wall Street.

Later, the combined firm purchased E.F. Hutton, becoming Shearson Lehman Hutton. Ultimately, however, American Express could not make the pieces of its financial services supermarket work. In 1993, under then newly appointed CEO, Harvey Golub, the firm sold its retail brokerage operations to Primerica. In 1994, it spun off a beleaguered Lehman Brothers as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., in an initial public offering.

Although the Kuhn, Loeb name is probably gone forever, the firm&#x27;s legacy is not. Former Kuhn, Loeb employees remain in senior positions throughout Wall Street, and until recently, at Lehman Brothers. Vestiges of the firm survived in the form of Lehman Brothers&#x27; extensive fixed income capabilities, including many of their bond indices, such as the Government/Credit index. This index, originally created in 1973 by Kuhn, Loeb, as the Government/Corporate index, was among the first generation of bond index data to measure the fixed income market. It is still the preeminent benchmark in its class.

<text>Sedulius (sometimes with the nomen Coelius or Caelius, both of doubtful authenticity) was a Christian poet in Hiberno-Latin during the first half of the 5th century.

==Biography==
Extremely little is known about his life. &quot;Sedulius&quot; is the Latin form of the Irish name &quot;Siadhal&quot;. The only trustworthy information, contained in his two letters to Macedonius, recounts that he devoted his early life, perhaps as a teacher of rhetoric, to secular literature. Late in life he converted to Christianity, or, if a Christian before, began to take his faith more seriously.
One medieval commentary states that he resided in Italy. Isidore of Seville ( 560 – 636) and the Gelasian decree refer to him as a presbyter.

==Works==
His fame rests mainly upon a long poem, &quot;Carmen paschale&quot;, based on the four gospels. In style a bombastic imitator of Virgil, he shows, nevertheless, a certain freedom in the handling of the Biblical story, and the poem soon became a quarry for the minor poets. His description of the Four Evangelists in &quot;Carmen Paschale&quot; became well-known; the English translation below is from .
His other writings include an Abecedarian hymn in honour of Christ, &quot;A solis ortus cardine&quot;, consisting of twenty-three quatrains of iambic dimeters. This poem has partly passed into the Roman Rite liturgy, the first seven quatrains forming the Christmas carol &quot;A solis ortus cardine&quot;, which has been translated into vernacular languages by, among many others, Martin Luther and Allan MacDonald. The Epiphany hymn, &quot;Hostis Herodes impie&quot;and &quot;Veteris et novi Testamenti collatio&quot; in elegiac couplets have also come down.

<doc id="1278368" wikidata="Q2923788" url="?curid=1278368" title="Brandon Stokley">
<text>Brandon Ray Stokley (born June 23, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Louisiana Ragin&#x27; Cajuns. He was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the fourth round of the 1999 NFL draft. He is famously known as The Slot Machine.

Stokley also played for the Indianapolis Colts, Seattle Seahawks, New York Giants, and Denver Broncos, earning two Super Bowl wins during his career. After his playing career, he became a radio personality.

==Personal life==

His father, Nelson Stokley, played college football at LSU and was the head coach of the Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin&#x27; Cajuns from 1986 to 1998. Brandon played wide receiver under his father from 1994 to 1997, with Jake Delhomme as quarterback through the 1996 season.

While in college, Stokley met his future wife, Lana, a two-time All-American left fielder in softball who led Southwestern Louisiana to two College World Series. The couple has two sons.

==Early life==

Stokley attended Ovey Comeaux High School (Lafayette, Louisiana) and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, Stokley won All-District 3-A honors, All-Parish honors, All-Acadiana honors, and All-State Class 5-A honors. In basketball, Stokley averaged 14 points a game and won All-District honors. In baseball, he won All-District honors.

==College career==

Brandon Stokley was a four-year letterman for the Ragin’ Cajun football team from 1995 to 1998. During his career as a wide receiver, Stokley had three 1,000+ yard seasons and was the first player in NCAA Division I-A to average 100 yards per game over a four-year career.

Stokley is the all-time UL Lafayette leader in passes caught at 241, reception yardage at 3,702 and touchdown receptions with 25.

==Professional career==
===First stint with Baltimore Ravens===
Stokley was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens out of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then named the University of Southwestern Louisiana, in the fourth round (105th pick overall) of the 1999 NFL draft. Stokley won a championship ring in Super Bowl XXXV (2001) as a member of the Ravens. In the game, he caught 3 passes for 52 yards, including the first touchdown of the game—a 38-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter.

===Indianapolis Colts===
In 2003, Stokley signed with the Indianapolis Colts. On December 26, 2004, Stokley received the record-breaking 21-yard touchdown pass for Peyton Manning in the hunt to break Dan Marino&#x27;s record of 48 touchdown passes in a season. That year, he had a breakout season with 68 passes caught for 1,077 yards and 10 touchdowns and an average of 15.8 yards per catch. Furthermore, the TD catch made the 2004 Colts the first NFL team to have three WRs with 1,000 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns or more in a season, the other two being Reggie Wayne and Marvin Harrison. The next two seasons of Stokley&#x27;s career were marred by various injuries. After he participated in only four games of the 2006 season, the Colts terminated his contract on March 1, 2007. Stokley earned his second Super Bowl ring after the Colts won Super Bowl XLI (2007) against the Chicago Bears, even though he wasn&#x27;t able to play in the game due to injury.

===First stint with Denver Broncos===
On March 14, 2007, Stokley signed with the Denver Broncos. On December 7, 2007, he signed a 3-year extension with the team. In a memorable play from the Broncos&#x27; 2009 season opener, Stokley caught a pass intended for teammate Brandon Marshall that was tipped by Cincinnati Bengal Leon Hall, and took it 87 yards into the end zone for the winning score. As he reached the 5-yard line, he abruptly changed direction and ran parallel to the goal line, running an additional six seconds off the clock, only crossing into the end zone once he reached the opposite side of the field. This ensured a win for the Broncos, who were trailing the Cincinnati Bengals 7–6 with 28 seconds left before Stokley&#x27;s touchdown reception. Stokley attributed the clock-burning run to having done so in video games &quot;probably hundreds of times&quot;, and it can be seen in the introduction of &quot;Madden NFL 11&quot;. With Stokley&#x27;s touchdown, the final score was 12–7 and the Broncos got their first 2009 regular season win. The play was also memorable for play-by-play commentator Gus Johnson&#x27;s call. Later that season, in week 16 against the Philadelphia Eagles, he was ejected from the game after slapping back judge Todd Prukop&#x27;s hand in retaliation for a no pass interference call. He was fined $25,000 for his actions.

On September 4, 2010, Stokley was released by the Broncos.

===Seattle Seahawks===
On September 28, 2010, Stokley signed with the Seattle Seahawks. His most notable contribution in Seattle came in the 2010 NFL Playoffs against the New Orleans Saints and the Chicago Bears. In those games, Stokley was the leading receiver for Seattle, catching four passes for 73 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans and 8 catches for 86 yards and a touchdown against Chicago. His performance was one of the keys to the 7-9 Seahawks&#x27; surprise upset of the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints. He was later cut by the Seahawks after the 2011 lockout ended. During free agency he expressed interest in the Washington Redskins but never signed with them.

===New York Giants===
On September 15, 2011, Stokley signed with the New York Giants. After catching 1 pass in two games, he was released by the team with an injury settlement on October 4. The Giants went on to win Super Bowl XLVI at the end of the season.

===Second stint with Broncos===
On April 16, 2012, Stokley agreed to a one-year contract to return to the Denver Broncos, reuniting him with his former quarterback, Peyton Manning. As a member of the team&#x27;s leadership council, Stokley went on to have one of his most productive seasons in several years, ending the year with 45 receptions, 544 receiving yards, and 5 touchdowns.

===Second stint with Ravens===
On August 10, 2013, Stokley agreed to terms with the Baltimore Ravens, reuniting him with the team that drafted him in 1999. On August 11, Stokley officially signed a one-year deal with the Ravens.
On October 5, the Ravens cut Stokley, and on October 8, the Ravens re-signed Stokley. Stokley suffered a concussion in a Week 14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings and was subsequently placed on injured reserve, ending his season.
On December 26, Stokley announced his decision to retire from professional football after the season.

==NFL career statistics==
==Radio career==
After his playing career ended, he went into sports radio. He co-hosts with Josh Dover weekdays from 11am to 2pm MST on 104.3 The Fan, a radio station in Denver.

<doc id="1278370" wikidata="Q777619" url="?curid=1278370" title="Strehaia">
<text>Strehaia () is a town in Mehedinți County, Oltenia, Romania. It is situated on the Motru River valley, in the eastern part of the county. Nine villages are administered by the town: Ciochiuța, Comanda, Hurducești, Lunca Banului, Menți, Motruleni, Slătinicu Mare, Slătinicu Mic, and Stăncești.

==Geography==
The town is located east of the county seat, Drobeta-Turnu Severin, on national road DN6 (part of the European route E70). It lies on the border with Gorj County, west of Filiași and southeast of Motru.

Forests in the vicinity are home to the largest Hermann&#x27;s tortoise colonies in Oltenia.

==Demographics==
At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 9,837. Of these, 88.79% were Romanians and 11.11% Roma; 99.4% were Romanian Orthodox. By the 2021 census, Strehaia&#x27;s population had decreased to 9,059 inhabitants; of those, 72.26% were Romanians and 14.28% Roma.

==History==
Strehaia was first mentioned in documents of the 15th century. As an alternative location for the residence of Oltenian Bans during the early Craiovești rules, the town still features the foundation of the Banate estate house; it had replaced Severin due to frequent Ottoman attacks, and was in turn replaced by Craiova, remaining a largely rural locality.

The Monastery of Strehaia was built by Wallachian Prince Matei Basarab in 1645. In 1671, a cattle fair was organized in the town, a regular event which contributed to the town&#x27;s development. Strehaia was the site of skirmishes between the Pandurs of Tudor Vladimirescu and troops loyal to Scarlat Callimachi, during the Wallachian uprising of 1821.

The estates of Prince Antoine Bibesco were located near Strehaia.

<doc id="1278374" wikidata="Q2463148" url="?curid=1278374" title="Euler brick">
<text>In mathematics, an Euler brick, named after Leonhard Euler, is a rectangular cuboid whose edges and face diagonals all have integer lengths. A primitive Euler brick is an Euler brick whose edge lengths are relatively prime. A perfect Euler brick is one whose space diagonal is also an integer, but such a brick has not yet been found.
== Definition ==
The definition of an Euler brick in geometric terms is equivalent to a solution to the following system of Diophantine equations:
:formula_1

where are the edges and are the diagonals.

== Properties ==

* If is a solution, then is also a solution for any . Consequently, the solutions in rational numbers are all rescalings of integer solutions. Given an Euler brick with edge-lengths , the triple constitutes an Euler brick as well.

* Exactly one edge and two face diagonals of a &quot;primitive&quot; Euler brick are odd.

* At least two edges of an Euler brick are divisible by 3.

* At least two edges of an Euler brick are divisible by 4.

* At least one edge of an Euler brick is divisible by 11.

== Examples ==
The smallest Euler brick, discovered by Paul Halcke in 1719, has edges and face diagonals . Some other small primitive solutions, given as edges — face diagonals , are below:

== Generating formula ==

Euler found at least two parametric solutions to the problem, but neither gives all solutions.

An infinitude of Euler bricks can be generated with Saunderson&#x27;s parametric formula. Let be a Pythagorean triple (that is, .) Then the edges

:formula_2

give face diagonals

:formula_3

There are many Euler bricks which are not parametrized as above, for instance the Euler brick with edges and face diagonals .

== Perfect cuboid ==

A perfect cuboid (also called a perfect Euler brick or perfect box) is an Euler brick whose space diagonal also has integer length. In other words, the following equation is added to the system of Diophantine equations defining an Euler brick:

:formula_4

where is the space diagonal. , no example of a perfect cuboid had been found and no one has proven that none exist.
Exhaustive computer searches show that, if a perfect cuboid exists,
* the odd edge must be greater than 2.5 × 1013,
* the smallest edge must be greater than , and
* the space diagonal must be greater than 9 × 1015.

Some facts are known about properties that must be satisfied by a &quot;primitive&quot; perfect cuboid, if one exists, based on modular arithmetic:

* One edge, two face diagonals and the space diagonal must be odd, one edge and the remaining face diagonal must be divisible by 4, and the remaining edge must be divisible by 16.
* Two edges must have length divisible by 3 and at least one of those edges must have length divisible by 9.
* One edge must have length divisible by 5.
* One edge must have length divisible by 7.
* One edge must have length divisible by 11.
* One edge must have length divisible by 19.
* One edge or space diagonal must be divisible by 13.
* One edge, face diagonal or space diagonal must be divisible by 17.
* One edge, face diagonal or space diagonal must be divisible by 29.
* One edge, face diagonal or space diagonal must be divisible by 37.

In addition:

* The space diagonal is neither a prime power nor a product of two primes.
* The space diagonal can only contain prime divisors that are congruent to 1 modulo 4.

If a perfect cuboid exists and formula_5 are its edges, formula_6 — the corresponding face diagonals and the space diagonal formula_7, then
* The triangle with the side lengths formula_8 is a Heronian triangle an area formula_9 with rational angle bisectors.
* The acute triangle with the side lengths formula_10, the obtuse triangles with the side lengths formula_11 are Heronian triangles, with area equal to formula_12.

===Cuboid conjectures===
Three cuboid conjectures are three mathematical propositions claiming irreducibility of three univariate polynomials with integer coefficients depending on several integer parameters. The conjectures are related to the perfect cuboid problem. Though they are not equivalent to the perfect cuboid problem, if all of these three conjectures are valid, then no perfect cuboids exist. They are neither proved nor disproved.

Cuboid conjecture 1. &quot;For any two positive coprime integer numbers formula_13 the eighth degree polynomial&quot;

&quot;is irreducible over the ring of integers formula_14&quot;.

Cuboid conjecture 2. &quot;For any two positive coprime integer numbers formula_15 the tenth-degree polynomial&quot;

&quot;is irreducible over the ring of integers formula_14&quot;.

Cuboid conjecture 3. &quot;For any three positive coprime integer numbers formula_17, formula_18, formula_19 such that none of the conditions&quot;

&quot;are fulfilled, the twelfth-degree polynomial&quot;

&quot;is irreducible over the ring of integers formula_14&quot;.

== Almost-perfect cuboids ==
An almost-perfect cuboid has 6 out of the 7 lengths as rational. Such cuboids can be sorted into three types, called &quot;body&quot;, &quot;edge&quot;, and &quot;face&quot; cuboids. In the case of the body cuboid, the body (space) diagonal is irrational. For the edge cuboid, one of the edges is irrational. The face cuboid has one of the face diagonals irrational.

The body cuboid is commonly referred to as the &quot;Euler cuboid&quot; in honor of Leonhard Euler, who discussed this type of cuboid. He was also aware of face cuboids, and provided the (104, 153, 672) example. The three integer cuboid edge lengths and three integer diagonal lengths of a face cuboid can also be interpreted as the edge lengths of a Heronian tetrahedron that is also a Schläfli orthoscheme. There are infinitely many face cuboids, and infinitely many Heronian orthoschemes.

The smallest solutions for each type of almost-perfect cuboids, given as edges, face diagonals and the space diagonal , are as follows:
* Body cuboid: 
* Edge cuboid: 
* Face cuboid: 

, there are 167,043 found cuboids with the smallest integer edge less than 200,000,000,027: 61,042 are Euler (body) cuboids, 16,612 are edge cuboids with a complex number edge length, 32,286 were edge cuboids, and 57,103 were face cuboids.

, an exhaustive search counted all edge and face cuboids with the smallest integer space diagonal less than 1,125,899,906,842,624: 194,652 were edge cuboids, 350,778 were face cuboids.

== Perfect parallelepiped ==
A perfect parallelepiped is a parallelepiped with integer-length edges, face diagonals, and body diagonals, but not necessarily with all right angles; a perfect cuboid is a special case of a perfect parallelepiped. In 2009, dozens of perfect parallelepipeds were shown to exist, answering an open question of Richard Guy. Some of these perfect parallelepipeds have two rectangular faces. The smallest perfect parallelepiped has edges 271, 106, and 103; short face diagonals 101, 266, and 255; long face diagonals 183, 312, and 323; and body diagonals 374, 300, 278, and 272.

== Connection to elliptic curves ==

In 2022, Aubrey de Grey published an exploration of perfect isosceles rectangular frusta, which he termed &quot;plinths&quot;. These are hexahedra with two rectangular faces of the same aspect ratio and four faces that are isosceles trapezia. Thus, as for almost-perfect cuboids and perfect parallelepipeds, a perfect cuboid would be a special case of a perfect plinth. Perfect plinths exist, but are much rarer for a given size than perfect parallelepipeds or almost-perfect cuboids. In a subsequent paper, de Grey, Philip Gibbs and Louie Helm built on this finding to explore classes of elliptic curve that correspond to perfect plinths, almost-perfect cuboids, and other generalisations of perfect cuboids. By this means they dramatically increased the range up to which perfect cuboids can be sought computationally, and thereby derived strong circumstantial evidence that none exists. They also showed that a large proportion of Pythagorean triples cannot form a face of a perfect cuboid, by identifying several families of elliptic curves that must have positive rank if a perfect cuboid exists. Independently, Paulsen and West showed that a perfect cuboid must correspond to a congruent number elliptic curve of rank at least 2.

<doc id="1278382" wikidata="Q2743673" url="?curid=1278382" title="Edwin R. A. Seligman">
<text>Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman (1861–1939), was an American economist who spent his entire academic career at Columbia University in New York City. Seligman is best remembered for his pioneering work involving taxation and public finance. His principles for a progressive federal income tax were adopted by Congress after the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment. A prolific scholar and teacher, his students had great influence on the fiscal architecture of postcolonial nations. He served as an influential founding member of the American Economics Association.

==Early life==
Edwin Seligman was born April 25, 1861, in New York City, the son of the banker Joseph Seligman. His family was Jewish. He was tutored by Horatio Alger and had a broad facility for languages.

Seligman attended Columbia University at fourteen and graduated in 1879 with an AB Seligman continued his studies in Europe, attending courses for three years at the universities of Berlin, Heidelberg, Geneva, and Paris. He earned his MA and LLB degrees in 1885 and successfully defended a PhD in 1885. He later was awarded a LL.D. in 1904.

==Academic career==
Seligman spent his entire academic career at Columbia University, first joining as a lecturer in 1885. He was made an adjunct professor of political economy in 1888. He became the first McVickar Professor of Political Economy at the same university in 1904, a position which he occupied until 1931.

Seligman&#x27;s academic work dealt largely with matters of taxation and public finance, and he was regarded as a leading proponent of the progressive income tax. He also taught courses at Columbia in the field of economic history.

Seligman dedicated a great deal of effort to the question of public finance during World War I and was a prominent advocate of the establishment of a progressive income tax as a basis for the funding of government operations.

Seligman&#x27;s later academic work revolved around questions of tax policy and consumer finance.

Although a proponent of the economic interpretation of history, commonly associated with Marxism, Seligman was an opponent of socialism and appeared in public debates opposing prominent radical figures during the early 1920s, including such figures as Scott Nearing and Harry Waton.

Among his students was B.R. Ambedkar, the Chief architect of Indian Constitution and first Law and Justice minister of India. Seligman&#x27;s teaching career ended in 1931.

===Professional leadership===
From 1886 Seligman was one of the editors of the &quot;Political Science Quarterly.&quot; He also edited Columbia&#x27;s series in history, economics, and public law from 1890.

Seligman was a founder of the American Economic Association and served as president of that organization from 1902 to 1904.

Selignman was a key figure in the formation of the American Association of University Professors. He chaired the committee that wrote the &quot;1915 Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure,&quot; now considered a landmark statement on academic freedom. He served as AAUP president from 1919 to 1920.

==Death and legacy==
Edwin Seligman died July 18, 1939. His beliefs were highly influential with Charles A. Beard, who was an academic colleague at Columbia. In particular, Seligman&#x27;s economic viewpoints to history helped inform Beard&#x27;s work &quot;An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States&quot;. As a mentor to fiscal experts including Carl Shoup, Seligman&#x27;s ideas also guided post-World War II tax reform.

<text>Barrio Sésamo (Sesame Neighborhood in English) is the Spanish co-production of the popular U.S. children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; produced by Televisión Española and Sesame Workshop (formerly Children&#x27;s Television Workshop) from 1979 to 2000, the equivalent of Plaza Sésamo in Mexico and Hispanic America. All characters adopted Spanish names while for the title of the series a more appropriate Spanish name was chosen: barrio (Neighborhood) instead of Street (calle).

==Ábrete Sésamo (1974-1978) ==
Previously, from 3 November 1974 to 29 March 1978, segments of the original &quot;Sesame Street&quot; were simply acquired by Televisión Española (TVE) and dubbed into Spanish to be aired with the title &quot;Ábrete Sésamo&quot; (es. Open Sesame) as part of its program &quot;container&quot; called &quot;Un globo, dos globos, tres globos&quot;.

==Barrio Sésamo (1978-1988)==

=== Season 1 (1978-1981) ===
In 1978, Televisión Española (TVE) and Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) agreed the terms for a co-production, after years where TVE simply aired the original Sesame Street dubbed segments. The new episodes included a 15 minute segment of dubbed footage, and another 15 minute segment of original footage.

Duncan Kenworthy from CTW was in charge of the USA production and Enrique Nicanor was assigned by TVE as director of the Spanish segments and designer of the two Spanish new original muppets &quot;Caponata&quot; and &quot;Perezgil&quot;

*Caponata was a red, orange and yellow feathered hen with curly pink hair similar in height () to Big Bird. Actress Emma Cohen was in charge of working inside the muppet body and providing the character&#x27;s voice. Caponata has the psychology of a six-year-old girl, naïve and curious about everything.
*Perezgil was a large green snail with round glasses and curly green hair. He was reader, writer, poet and advisor of everybody in the neighborhood. Actor Jesús Alcaide was in charge of working the muppet as well as providing its voice.

Human characters includes:

* Nisi: Juan Margallo, the bar owner
* Angela: Petra Martínez, Nisi&#x27;s wife
* Braulio: Manolo Aleixandre and/or José Riesgo, the newsstand owner
* Manolo: Manolo Vallejo, the garage owner
* Carmen: Concha Goyanes
* Cuqui: Gabriel Fariza, the radio reporter
* Jose: Marcelo Rubal

American characters with Spanish names:
*Bert: Blas
*Ernie: Epi
*Kermit the Frog: Gustavo, la rana
*Grover: Coco
*Cookie Monster: Triqui
*Count von Count: El conde draco

==== Cancellation ====
The &quot;First Barrio Sésamo&quot; season was cancelled by TVE in 1981 when they denied the authors to keep their rights on the characters. An agreement had been reached where the authors granted full commercial rights to the station except the right to be mentioned as authors and the right to deny the use of the muppets for commercial advertising of carbonized drinks and unhealthy products for children, the same rights that Jim Henson kept with all his own characters. The station fired the first creators and banned the characters from appearing in the new season. The person responsible for the Children&#x27;s Department at the station commissioned the American co-production company, CTW USA, to create and provide new &quot;Spanish&quot; muppets with new names. With that action, &quot;Barrio Sésamo&quot; was no longer a co-production with Spanish-created characters.

=== La Cometa Blanca (1981-1983) ===
From 1981 to 1983, a different TVE children&#x27;s program, &quot;La Cometa Blanca&quot;, included some sketches from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. This program was directed by Muppet fan Lolo Rico and featured some actors who would later appear in Barrio Sésamo, mainly Mari Luz Olier, Alfonso Vallejo, and the child-actress Ruth Gabriel (then known as Ruth Abellán).

=== Seasons 2-4 (1983-1988) ===
The &quot;Sesame Street&quot; sketches in &quot;La Cometa Blanca&quot; were so successful with their young audience that the Spanish version was given another chance in 1983. Only José Riesgo as Julián returned from the first season. Caponata and Perezgil were replaced by two new Muppets totally designed, this time, and constructed by CTW. The main character was Espinete, a large pink hedgehog that replaced Caponata. Like Caponata, Espinete was a full-body Muppet and was the main character on the show, played by Chelo Vivares. He became famous for sleeping in pajamas in spite of being &quot;naked&quot; the rest of the day.

Other characters included:
*Don Pimpón (Alfonso Vallejo): Another full-body Muppet. This farmer was an undetermined brown being, similar to a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; monster.
*Chema (Juan Sánchez): The baker of Barrio Sésamo.
*Ana (Isabel Castro): The young friend of everybody.
*Don Julián (José Riesgo): The old owner of a mobile news stand.
*Matilde (Mari Luz Olier) and Antonio (José Enrique Camacho): married owners of an horchata shop
*Roberto (Roberto Mayor) and Ruth (Ruth Gabriel, as Ruth Abellán): Matilde and Antonio&#x27;s children

In 1983, one year after the second season started, a new government won the elections in Spain and José Maria Calviño was appointed as Director General of RTVE. The new staff fired those involved in the cancellation of the original series. The creator of the banned first season was called by the station and was appointed as new Head of the Children&#x27; Programmes Unit and later Director of the TVE-2 channel.

The show finished around April 1988 and was replaced by &quot;Los Mundos de Yupi&quot;, a similar program fully produced by TVE, featuring three extraterrestrial characters.

== Barrio Sésamo revival (1996-2000) ==
In 1996, the show returned to TVE, this time being produced in both Catalan and Spanish.

New characters included &quot;Bluki&quot; (a blue full-body cat-like Muppet), &quot;Vera&quot; (a yellow monster), &quot;Bubo&quot; (an owl) and &quot;Gaspar&quot; (a human Muppet). Additional characters that made occasional appearances included a wild monster with red fur and a healthy appetite — portraying a role similar to Cookie Monster&#x27;s — and a tan Anything Muppet that could be turned into characters (such as a baby, a girl friend of Vera&#x27;s, a clumsy man with a moustache, or a pig). The show&#x27;s directors were Enrique Nicanor, Antonio Torets, and Jose María Vidal (co-director).

== Later Spanish dubs ==
Since 2006, Juega Conmigo, Sésamo, the Castilian Spanish dub of Play with Me Sesame, has been broadcast on Antena 3.

Since 2012, Super Healthy Monsters is a 5 to 7-minute series focuses on activities and foods that keep one healthy. Sesame Workshop produced 26 episodes in English, which initially aired dubbed in Spain on Antena 3 as a Barrio Sésamo mini-series called &quot;Monstruos Supersanos.&quot;

On April 28, 2016, El Hotel Furchester, the Castilian Spanish dub of The Furchester Hotel, was broadcast in Spain on TVE Clan.

The show is part of the HBO programming in Spain under its original title, Sesame Street, with dubbed episodes of the HBO seasons from 2017 to present.

<text>In differential calculus, related rates problems involve finding a rate at which a quantity changes by relating that quantity to other quantities whose rates of change are known. The rate of change is usually with respect to time. Because science and engineering often relate quantities to each other, the methods of related rates have broad applications in these fields. Differentiation with respect to time or one of the other variables requires application of the chain rule, since most problems involve several variables.

Fundamentally, if a function formula_1 is defined such that formula_2, then the derivative of the function formula_1 can be taken with respect to another variable. We assume formula_4 is a function of formula_5, i.e. formula_6. Then formula_7, so

: formula_8

Written in Leibniz notation, this is:

: formula_9

Thus, if it is known how formula_4 changes with respect to formula_5, then we can determine how formula_1 changes with respect to formula_5 and vice versa. We can extend this application of the chain rule with the sum, difference, product and quotient rules of calculus, etc.

For example, if formula_14 then
: formula_15

== Procedure ==

The most common way to approach related rates problems is the following:
#Identify the known variables, including rates of change and the rate of change that is to be found. (Drawing a picture or representation of the problem can help to keep everything in order)
#Construct an equation relating the quantities whose rates of change are known to the quantity whose rate of change is to be found.
#Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (or other rate of change). Often, the chain rule is employed at this step.
#Substitute the known rates of change and the known quantities into the equation.
#Solve for the wanted rate of change.

Errors in this procedure are often caused by plugging in the known values for the variables &quot;before&quot; (rather than after) finding the derivative with respect to time. Doing so will yield an incorrect result, since if those values are substituted for the variables before differentiation, those variables will become constants; and when the equation is differentiated, zeroes appear in places of all variables for which the values were plugged in.

==Example==
A 10-meter ladder is leaning against the wall of a building, and the base of the ladder is sliding away from the building at a rate of 3 meters per second. How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base of the ladder is 6 meters from the wall?

The distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, &quot;x&quot;, and the height of the ladder on the wall, &quot;y&quot;, represent the sides of a right triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse, &quot;h&quot;. The objective is to find &quot;dy&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;, the rate of change of &quot;y&quot; with respect to time, &quot;t&quot;, when &quot;h&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;dx&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;, the rate of change of &quot;x&quot;, are known.

Step 1:
*formula_16
*formula_17
*formula_18
*formula_19
*formula_20

Step 2:
From the Pythagorean theorem, the equation
:formula_21
describes the relationship between &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;h&quot;, for a right triangle. Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time, &quot;t&quot;, yields
:formula_22

Step 3:
When solved for the wanted rate of change, &quot;dy&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;, gives us
:formula_23
:formula_24
:formula_25
:formula_26

Step 4 &amp; 5:
Using the variables from step 1 gives us:
:formula_26
:formula_28
Solving for y using the Pythagorean Theorem gives:
:formula_29
:formula_30
:formula_31

Plugging in 8 for the equation:
:formula_32

It is generally assumed that negative values represent the downward direction. In doing such, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of meters per second.

==Physics examples==

Because one physical quantity often depends on another, which, in turn depends on others, such as time, related-rates methods have broad applications in Physics. This section presents an example of related rates kinematics and electromagnetic induction.

===Relative kinematics of two vehicles===
For example, one can consider the kinematics problem where one vehicle is heading West toward an intersection at 80 miles per hour while another is heading North away from the intersection at 60 miles per hour. One can ask whether the vehicles are getting closer or further apart and at what rate at the moment when the North bound vehicle is 3 miles North of the intersection and the West bound vehicle is 4 miles East of the intersection.

Big idea: use chain rule to compute rate of change of distance between two vehicles.

Plan:
#Choose coordinate system
#Identify variables
#Draw picture
#Big idea: use chain rule to compute rate of change of distance between two vehicles
#Express &quot;c&quot; in terms of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; via Pythagorean theorem
#Express &quot;dc&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; using chain rule in terms of &quot;dx&quot;/&quot;d&quot;t and &quot;dy&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;
#Substitute in &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;dx&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;, &quot;dy&quot;/&quot;dt&quot;
#Simplify.

Choose coordinate system:
Let the &quot;y&quot;-axis point North and the &quot;x&quot;-axis point East.

Identify variables:
Define &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) to be the distance of the vehicle heading North from the origin and &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) to be the distance of the vehicle heading West from the origin.

Express &quot;c&quot; in terms of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; via the Pythagorean theorem:

: formula_33

Express &quot;dc&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; using chain rule in terms of &quot;dx&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; and &quot;dy/dt:&quot;

Substitute in &quot;x&quot; = 4 mi, &quot;y&quot; = 3 mi, &quot;dx&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; = −80 mi/hr, &quot;dy&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; = 60 mi/hr and simplify

: formula_34

Consequently, the two vehicles are getting closer together at a rate of 28 mi/hr.

===Electromagnetic induction of conducting loop spinning in magnetic field===
The magnetic flux through a loop of area &quot;A&quot; whose normal is at an angle &quot;θ&quot; to a magnetic field of strength &quot;B&quot; is

: formula_35

Faraday&#x27;s law of electromagnetic induction states that the induced electromotive force formula_36 is the negative rate of change of magnetic flux formula_37 through a conducting loop.

: formula_38

If the loop area &quot;A&quot; and magnetic field &quot;B&quot; are held constant, but the loop is rotated so that the angle &quot;θ&quot; is a known function of time, the rate of change of &quot;θ&quot; can be related to the rate of change of formula_37 (and therefore the electromotive force) by taking the time derivative of the flux relation

: formula_40

If for example, the loop is rotating at a constant angular velocity &quot;ω&quot;, so that &quot;θ&quot; = &quot;ωt&quot;, then

: formula_41
