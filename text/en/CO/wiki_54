<text>Taganrog (, ) is a port city in Rostov Oblast, Russia, on the north shore of Taganrog Bay in the Sea of Azov, several kilometers west of the mouth of the Don River. It is in the Black Sea region. Population: 

==History==
The history of the city goes back to the late Bronze Age–early Iron Age. Later, it became the earliest Greek settlement in the northwestern Black Sea region and was probably mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus as emporion Kremnoi (Κρήμνοι, meaning cliffs). It had contacts as well to the other Greek colonies around the Black Sea as well as to the indigenous communities of the hinterland.

In the 13th century, Pisan merchants founded a colony, Portus Pisanus, which was however short-lived. Taganrog was founded by Peter the Great on 12 September 1698. The first Russian Navy base, it hosted the Azov Flotilla of Catherine the Great (1770–1783), which subsequently became the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Taganrog was granted city status in 1775.

By the end of the 18th century, Taganrog had lost its importance as a military base after Crimea and the entire Sea of Azov were absorbed into the Russian Empire. In 1802, Tsar Alexander I granted the city special status, which lasted until 1887. In 1825, the Alexander I Palace in Taganrog was used as his summer residence, and he died there in November 1825. Also in Taganrog is the House of Teacher, a mansion where numerous artists have performed.

Although it had been bombarded and damaged by an Anglo-French fleet in 1855, Taganrog became important as a commercial port, used for the import of grain by the end of the 19th century until the early 20th century. Industrialization increased in the city when Belgian and German investors founded a boiler factory, an iron and steel foundry, a leather factory, and an oil press factory. By 1911, fifteen foreign consulates had opened in the city.

During World War I, Taganrog served as the temporary capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in March-April 1918. Afterwards it was occupied by the troops of the German Army from May to August 1918. In 1919, General Anton Denikin established his headquarters at the Avgerino mansion in the city while commanding White Russian troops fighting in South Russia during the Russian Civil War. When the White Russians were defeated and Bolshevik power was established in the city on 25 December 1919, Denikin&#x27;s remaining troops and the British Consulate were evacuated by HMS &quot;Montrose&quot;. Full power was granted to the executive committee of The City Soviet Workers&#x27; council on 17 December 1920, and Taganrog joined the Ukrainian SSR as the administrative center of Taganrog Okrug. It was transferred to the Russian SFSR along with Shakhty Okrug on 1 October 1924.

During World War II, Taganrog was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1943 during Operation Barbarossa, when two SS divisions entered the city on 17 October 1941, followed by the Wehrmacht. The city suffered extensive damage. Under German occupation the local government system was replaced by a German-style &quot;Bürgermeisteramt&quot; (Mayor&#x27;s Office), which governed the city until it was liberated by the Red Army on 30 August 1943.

It is believed that Taganrog may have been the &quot;Lukomorye&quot; (fairy tale land) in which Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot; (1820) was set. The city also appeared in the novels of Ivan Vasilenko and Konstantin Paustovsky and in the poems of Nikolay Sherbina and Valentin Parnakh.

<doc id="1288090" wikidata="Q4023973" url="?curid=1288090" title="Zebra (American band)">
<text>Zebra is an American hard rock band founded in 1975 in New Orleans, Louisiana. It features guitarist and lead vocalist Randy Jackson, bassist Felix Hanemann and drummer Guy Gelso.

== History ==
In the early 1970s, Jackson and Hanemann played together in a bar band called Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, but in late 1974 they left Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and founded a new band, Maelstrom, with Gelso on drums and Tim Thorson on keyboards. The group initially was a cover band, playing Led Zeppelin and other technically proficient rock groups such as Yes, Jethro Tull, and Pink Floyd. 

But in February 1975, after Thorson left, the band decided to stay as a trio, with Hanemann handling keyboards as well as bass. They then adopted the name Zebra after seeing a cover of the magazine &quot;Vogue&quot; featuring a woman riding a zebra. Initially based in New Orleans, they increasingly played more often on Long Island, and eventually all three members moved there to pursue success. They had introduced their original material into their cover sets years before they were signed to Atlantic Records, including &quot;The La La Song&quot;, &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Bears&quot; (originally entitled &quot;The Bears are Hibernating&quot;).

Zebra had been noticed by local colleges and even had some of their early original performances recorded by Long Island FM radio station WBAB, culminating in the inclusion of one of their songs on a release of &quot;WBAB Homegrown Album&quot;, which commemorated local acts and performances culled from the station&#x27;s on-air &quot;Homegrown Hour&quot; program.

Zebra&#x27;s mainstream debut on Atlantic Records was in 1983 with their eponymous album, produced by Jack Douglas and featuring the singles &quot;Tell Me What You Want&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Behind The Door?&quot; The band continued to tour throughout the 1980s but took a temporary break in the early 1990s after being dropped by Atlantic Records. Randy Jackson formed his solo band &quot;Randy Jackson&#x27;s China Rain,&quot; and released its only album in 1991.

Zebra finally resumed playing in 1994 and released &quot;Zebra IV&quot; in 2003, their first album of all-new material since 1986. A DVD of live performances, mostly from a show at the House of Blues in New Orleans, was released in the summer of 2007.

During the first half of 2007, drummer Bobby Rondinelli filled in for Guy Gelso, who was undergoing treatment for chest cancer. Fortunately, he came through it and was back with Zebra by the end of that year.

On July 10, 2010, during their 35th-anniversary performance at New Orleans&#x27; Mahalia Jackson Theater, Zebra was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and on October 8, 2012 they were also inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame.

In March 2013, Zebra performed on Cruise to the Edge, a concert cruise featuring notable progressive rock bands including Yes, Steve Hackett, UK, Carl Palmer Band, Ambrosia, Saga, Nektar, Glass Hammer and IOEarth.

Although Zebra has not released any studio material since 2003&#x27;s &quot;Zebra IV&quot;, the band continues to perform live, mostly in the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States, including New Orleans and New York City. 

In February 2017 Jackson reported to &quot;Shreveport Times&quot; that the band was working on a new album: &quot;I have new material and hopefully we&#x27;ll get to work on a new record in the next couple of months.&quot; As of 2025, the new album, which will reunite the band with producer Jack Douglas, who produced Zebra&#x27;s first two albums, is planned to mark the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

In addition to a new album, a documentary on Zebra, tentatively titled &quot;Tell Me What You Want: 50 Years of Zebra&quot;, is in the works.

<doc id="1288104" wikidata="Q1352222" url="?curid=1288104" title="William Collins Whitney">
<text>William Collins Whitney (July 5, 1841February 2, 1904) was an American political leader and financier and a prominent member of the Whitney family. He served as Secretary of the Navy in the first administration of President Grover Cleveland from 1885 through 1889. A conservative reformer, he was considered a Bourbon Democrat.

==Early life==
William Whitney was born at Conway, Massachusetts, of Puritan stock. The family were descended from John Whitney of London, who settled at Watertown, Massachusetts, in 1635. William Whitney&#x27;s father was Brigadier General James Scollay Whitney; his mother, Laurinda Collins, was a descendant of Plymouth governor William Bradford. Laurinda&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Joseph Collins (1747–1826) was a great-grandson of Alice Bradford Adams (1659–1745) through her daughter, Alice Adams Collins (1682–1734). The older Alice was a daughter of William Bradford the Younger.

William Whitney had a well known older brother, industrialist Henry Melville Whitney (1839–1923), president of the Metropolitan Steamship Company, founder of the West End Street Railway Company of Boston, and later founder of the Dominion Coal Company and Dominion Iron and Steel Company in Sydney, Nova Scotia on Cape Breton Island. His sister Laurinda Collins &quot;Lily&quot; Whitney married Charles T. Barney, who became the president of the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Another sister, Susan Collins Whitney, married attorney Henry F. Dimock.

Educated at Williston Seminary, Easthampton, Massachusetts, Whitney graduated from Yale University in 1863, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, and then studied law at Harvard. He left in 1864 to study law with Abraham R. Lawrence in New York City, and in 1865 was admitted to the bar.

==Political career==
Whitney was active in organizing the Young Men&#x27;s Democratic Club in 1871. He was an aggressive opponent of the Tweed Ring, and was actively allied with the anti-Tammany County Democracy of 1871–1890. In 1872, he was made inspector of schools, but the same year met defeat in the election for district attorney.

From 1875 to 1882 he was Corporation counsel of New York City, and as such brought about a codification of the laws relating to the city, and successfully contested a large part of certain claims, largely fraudulent, against the city, amounting to about $20 million, and a heritage from the Boss Tweed regime.
In 1882, he resigned to attend to personal interests.

In 1883, through the Broadway Railroad Company, Whitney became involved in a struggle with Jacob Sharp and Thomas Fortune Ryan for the Broadway street-railway franchise. Sharp initially won the franchise by means of bribery, but in December 1884 Ryan formed an alliance with Whitney and Peter A.B. Widener. By arousing public opinion, instituting court action, and prompting legislative investigation, they defeated Sharp. The Ryan syndicate finally received the franchise in 1886.

During President Cleveland&#x27;s first administration (1885–1889), Whitney was United States Secretary of the Navy, and did much to develop the United States Navy. The contracts issued under the previous administration were investigated impartially by a committee appointed by Whitney and comprising Commander Robley D. Evans, Commodore George Belknap and Herman Winter, chief engineer of the Metropolitan Steamship Company. Whitney promoted the adoption by industry of the technology needed for the construction of steel steamships and modern naval guns and the domestic manufacture of plate armor. He also reorganized the finances and logistics of the Navy Department and helped make the Naval War College a success.

When Whitney left office in 1889, steel vessels completed or under construction included the armored cruiser (later battleship) ; monitors &quot;Puritan&quot;, &quot;Amphitrite&quot;, &quot;Monadnock&quot;, &quot;Terror&quot; and &quot;Miantonomoh&quot;; protected cruisers &quot;Atlanta&quot;, &quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Newark&quot;, &quot;Charleston&quot;, , &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and &quot;San Francisco&quot;; dynamite-gun cruiser ; dispatch vessel &quot;Dolphin&quot;; gunboats , , and ; and torpedo boat &quot;Cushing&quot;. These constituted the nucleus of the &quot;New Navy&quot; During Whitney&#x27;s four years in the cabinet, his home in Washington, D.C., was a social center of great attraction. In 1888, Yale conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D.

Whitney joined Charles T. Barney, Henry F. Dimock, W.E.D. Stokes, Francis W. Jenks, and others in forming the New York Loan and Improvement Company in 1890. 
This concern developed the Washington Heights section of New York City. 
Barney was president of the company when he died in 1907, three years after Whitney. In opposition to Tammany, Whitney was instrumental in bringing about the third nomination of Cleveland in 1892, and took an influential part in the ensuing presidential campaign.

Whitney joined his brother Henry in organizing the Dominion Coal Company Ltd. in 1893, and the Dominion Iron and Steel Company Ltd. in 1899, to exploit the mineral resources of the Sydney district of Cape Breton Island. Other early investors included Henry F. Dimock, Almeric H. Paget and Charles T. Barney. In the next general election, in 1896, disapproving of the &quot;free-silver&quot; agitation, Whitney refused to support his party&#x27;s candidate, William Jennings Bryan.
==Thoroughbred horse racing==
William Whitney was also a major investor in thoroughbred horse racing, hiring the best trainers, buying the best horses, and engaging the services of the best jockey of the day. He established Westbury Stable with a string of thoroughbred race horses, competing against the successful stable of business associate James R. Keene. At his vast summer estate near Old Westbury on Long Island, Whitney built an stable with 84 box stalls and an adjoining mile-long training track. Around the start of the 20th century, in the United States his horses were trained by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee John W. Rogers and in England by John Huggins.

Whitney maintained a city residence in New York; a Venetian palace and 5,000 acres in Wheatley Hills, near Jamaica, New York; a Sheepshead Bay house, with a private track covering 300 acres; a mansion with 700 acres at Lenox, Massachusetts; October Mountain summer cottage, a 10,000-acre estate including an 800-acre fenced-in game reserve, in Washington, Massachusetts; Kentucky Stock Farm, a Blue Grass farm of 3,000 acres; Stony Ford Farm, New York, used as an auxiliary to Kentucky Stock Farm; an Adirondack game preserve of 16,000 acres; and a lodge at Blue Mountain Lake, New York, with a fine golf course. Whitney also spent time in the equestrian community of Aiken, South Carolina, revamping a local cottage into a 69-room winter residence that included 15 bathrooms, a full-size ballroom, a squash court and a stable to house 30 horses. He had his own personal Pullman named Wanderer which made the Aiken trip tolerable. His involvement in Aiken along with that of Thomas Hitchcock, the Vanderbilt family, the Astor family and other equestrian minded business associates helped establish the premier Aiken Winter Colony. Aiken remains a haven where horses are brought in from the north to train and enjoy a more temperate winter.

He was the breeder of twenty-six American stakes winners, including the great filly Artful from his stallion Hamburg. On June 5, 1901, Whitney won England&#x27;s Derby with Volodyovski, leased by him from Lady Valerie Meux. On October 24, 1903, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that W.C. Whitney had entered into a ten-year lease deal with Alexander John (A.J.) Alexander for one thousand acres (4 km2) of the Wood Stud farm property at Spring Station, Kentucky. 

In 1901 Whitney led a group of investors who bought the Saratoga Race Course, which had been in decline. Whitney made major improvements to the track and is widely credited with revitalizing racing at Saratoga.

==Personal life==
On October 13, 1869, he married Flora Payne, daughter of Senator Henry B. Payne of Ohio and sister of Whitney&#x27;s Yale classmate, Colonel Oliver Hazard Payne, later treasurer of the Standard Oil Company. The Whitneys lived in the now-lost Stevens Mansion at 2 West 57th Street, where they commissioned Stanford White to renovate the interiors. They had five children:

* Harry Payne Whitney (1872–1930), who married Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875–1942)
* Pauline Payne Whitney (1874–1916), who married Almeric Hugh Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough (1861–1949)
* William Payne Whitney (1876–1927), who married Helen Julia Hay (1875–1944)
* Oliver Whitney (1878–1883), who died aged 5
* Dorothy Payne Whitney (1887–1968), who first married Willard Dickerman Straight (1880–1918) and later married Leonard Knight Elmhirst (1893–1974)

Flora Payne Whitney died on February 5, 1893, at age fifty-two. Two years later, in 1896, William Whitney remarried to widow Sibyl Randolph (née May). He gave his home at 2 West 57th Street to son Harry and his new bride Gertrude, and acquired for his new wife a residence at 871 Fifth Avenue at 68th Street in New York City, and commissioned McKim, Mead &amp; White to do a $3.5 million renovation of the house. In 1898, Sibyl Whitney suffered a horse riding accident at their estate, Joye Cottage, in the Aiken Winter Colony (now known as Hitchcock Woods) in Aiken, South Carolina, and died at age forty-one on May 6, 1899.

Whitney was a member of Ward McAllister&#x27;s &quot;Four Hundred&quot; as well as the Patriarch Society until its dissolution in April 1897. On January 5, 1901, at his residence at 871 Fifth Avenue, Whitney gave a debutante ball for his niece, Helen Barney.

He remained active in street-railway affairs until the reorganization of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company in 1902. At that time he retired from all personal identification with the company.

William Collins Whitney died on February 2, 1904, and was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. At the time of his death he was one of the largest landowners in the eastern United States, worth approximately $23 million (1/993rd of US GNP).

===Honors===
In his honor:
*The USS &quot;Whitney&quot; (AD-4) was named after him when launched on October 12, 1923, at the Boston Navy Yard
*The William C. Whitney Wilderness Area of the Adirondack Park in Upstate New York is also named in his honor.

<doc id="1288119" wikidata="Q1616425" url="?curid=1288119" title="Peel station (Montreal Metro)">
<text>Peel station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro.

==Architecture and art==
Designed by Papineau, Gérin-Lajoie, and Leblanc, it is a normal side platform station, built in open-cut under boul. De Maisonneuve. Its mezzanine floats within the open-cut volume, supported by pillars and beams, and contains ticket barriers at either end with the fare-paid zone in the centre. There are two entrances at the west end of the station, one with shops and services, and three at the east end, including underground city access to Les Cours Mont-Royal and points east. All of the street entrances are integrated into other buildings.

A circular theme is present throughout the station&#x27;s decor: there are bright single colour circles on light panels surrounding the advertising posters, circles in the marble of one entrance, circular tiles on the floor and walls, but the best-known works of art in the station, and the main artwork, are a series of 54 large circles (of which 37 remain) by Jean-Paul Mousseau, one of the few artworks to be integrated into the architecture of the original network rather than commissioned later. Created in collaboration with ceramist Claude Vermette, these circles, set in floors and walls throughout the station, are mainly in tones of orange or blue streaked with other colours. A sculpture by Maurice Lemieux entitled &quot;Enterspace&quot; stands outside the Peel Nord entrance.

==Origin of the name==
The station is named for Peel Street, which in turn was named for Sir Robert Peel, British Prime Minister from 1834 to 1835 and again from 1841 to 1846. He is best known for creating London&#x27;s police department while Home Secretary, thus giving them their nickname of &quot;Bobbies&quot;.

<doc id="1288141" wikidata="Q570393" url="?curid=1288141" title="Editors (band)">
<text>Editors are an English rock band, formed in 2002 in Birmingham. Previously known as Pilot, The Pride and Snowfield, the band currently consists of Tom Smith (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Russell Leetch (bass guitar, synthesiser, backing vocals), Ed Lay (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Justin Lockey (lead guitar), Elliott Williams (keys, synthesizers, guitars, and backing vocals), and Benjamin John Power (composer and producer).

Editors have so far released two platinum studio albums, and seven in total, with several million combined sales. Their debut album &quot;The Back Room&quot; was released in 2005. It contained the hits &quot;Munich&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot; and the following year received a Mercury Prize nomination.

Their follow-up album &quot;An End Has a Start&quot; went to number 1 in the UK Album Chart in June 2007 and earned the band a Brit Awards nomination for best British Band. It also spawned another Top 10 hit single, &quot;Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors&quot;. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;In This Light and on This Evening&quot;, was released in October 2009 and went straight to number 1 in the UK Album Chart. The band released their fourth studio album, &quot;The Weight of Your Love&quot;, in July 2013, followed by self-produced &quot;In Dream&quot; in October 2015. In 2018, the band released their sixth album &quot;Violence&quot;. Their seventh album, &quot;EBM&quot;, was released in September 2022.

Alongside their critical acclaim and strong success in the UK Singles Chart, they consistently enjoyed sold-out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. Their brand of dark indie rock is commonly compared to the sound of bands such as Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Joy Division, Interpol, The Chameleons and U2.

==History==
===Formation (2002–2004)===
The band met while studying Music Technology at Staffordshire University, but living in Birmingham and playing at venues such as the Jug of Ale and the Flapper &amp; Firkin. In an interview in 2015, Tom Smith said, &quot;Birmingham is very important. Looking back further it was where we all lived together in the early years, played all those Flapper and Jug of Ale shows, and then got our record deal. We&#x27;ve always said although only one of us was brought up there, Birmingham was the band&#x27;s home&quot;.

The band was initially known as Pilot and played its first show under this name in 2002. While in college, the band constructed a marketing strategy which involved placing hundreds of promotional stickers across the walls of Stafford asking &quot;Who&#x27;s the Pilot?&quot;. However, they realized the name was already taken by a 1970s Scottish pop group, so they changed their name to The Pride.

They made a promo under this name with the tracks &quot;Come Share the View&quot; and &quot;Forest Fire&quot; and made the songs available on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Onemusic Unsigned&quot;. A review of the songs reads, &quot;&quot;The Pride&quot; keep things subliminally lo-fi. Refreshingly simple and restrained, &#x27;Come Share The View&#x27; is a lesson in welding hypnotic soundscapes with white noise while showing allegiance to the school of slo-mo on &quot;Forest Fire&quot;&quot;. The band then took its music offline to encourage more &quot;A&amp;R&quot; representatives to see them perform.

Ed Lay replaced drummer Geraint Owen, who began to focus on his Welsh band &quot;The Heights&quot;. Under this lineup they became known as Snowfield. They played their debut gig under this name at the request of Fused Magazine in March 2003. The following summer the band self-released a demo six-track EP, of which all six songs went on to become future Editors songs. In the autumn of 2003, after graduation, the band relocated to Birmingham, the home of their management and the nearest big city.

For the next year, the band members worked part-time jobs along in addition to working in the band. After regular gigging around the Midlands, it was not long until word of mouth helped them become a popular unsigned band. They sent out a one-track demo of &quot;Bullets&quot;. This demo attracted the interest of several British labels, including thirty A&amp;R reps who came to see them play in Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle-based indie label Kitchenware Records. At that point they changed their band name to Editors.

===&quot;The Back Room&quot; (2005–2006)===
After supporting bands such as Puressence and Oceansize, Editors released debut single &quot;Bullets&quot;, which was recorded with producer Gavin Monaghan, as a limited edition of 1000 copies on Kitchenware Records on 24 January 2005. The song had previously been played by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1, where it was &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27;. The limited run sold out on the day of its release, with copies selling later the same week for more than £30 on eBay.

The release of &quot;Munich&quot; followed in April of that year and gave the band their first Top 25 hit, a sold out UK tour and a place on MTV&#x27;s Spanking New Music show in Manchester. At this point, due to the band&#x27;s increasing popularity, Editors and Kitchenware signed an exclusive distribution deal with Sony BMG. &quot;Blood&quot; was released two months later, reaching number 18 in the UK Singles Chart in its first week, selling 5,286 copies. With these releases their fanbase continued to grow and on 25 July 2005 their debut album &quot;The Back Room&quot; was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. In its first week, the album entered the charts at number 13, selling 17,627 copies. After re-issuing &quot;Bullets&quot; and achieving another Top 30 hit, Editors gained a high-profile support slot, supporting Franz Ferdinand in arenas across the UK and Europe.

Editors then re-issued &quot;Munich&quot; in January 2006, selling one and half thousand more copies than the last time it was released. The song gave Editors their first Top 10 single and an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. With the single release, &quot;The Back Room&quot; also rose back up the album charts, peaking at number 2. It sold an additional 40,000 copies in the week of &quot;Munich&quot;&#x27;s release and went platinum in the process. A joint North American tour with Stellastarr* coincided with the American release of &quot;The Back Room&quot; in March 2006. It was released by Fader label and sold 35,000 albums after 20 weeks. The band went on to play influential American festivals in 2006 such as Coachella and Lollapalooza. Editors proceeded to perform &quot;Munich&quot; on the American television show &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

At the end of March, Editors released &quot;All Sparks&quot; as a single in the United Kingdom, achieving a position of 21 in the singles chart. After a European tour which included three successive nights at Brixton Academy, Editors re-issued a limited edition of &quot;Blood&quot;. It entered the Top 40, pushing the album up the chart 45 places. Shortly after this, &quot;The Back Room&quot; hit the million mark in sales worldwide and was also nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize. After a string of high-profile festival shows across Europe, including slots on T in the Park, V 2006 and the Isle of Wight Festival, Editors began work on their second album.

===&quot;An End Has a Start&quot; (2007–2008)===

Editors recorded their second album &quot;An End Has a Start&quot; with producer Jacknife Lee in Grouse Lodge, Ireland over a two-month period beginning in late November 2006. It was released on 25 June 2007 and went straight to number 1 in the UK album charts, selling 59,405 copies in its first week. The album was preceded by the Top 10 single &quot;Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors&quot; on the 18th. The song was Editors&#x27; highest-charting single, reaching number 7. It also earned its own Making the Video episode on MTV.
Just after the album&#x27;s release, Editors played at the Glastonbury Festival with a second from top slot on &quot;The Other Stage&quot;. They also played many other festivals such as Oxegen, Lowlands and Pukkelpop over the following weeks, as well as playing their first ever tour dates in Australia and New Zealand. They then released the album&#x27;s title track &quot;An End Has a Start&quot; in September to coincide with their North American tour. Editors went on to play the song live on American television shows such as &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

Upon returning to the UK, the band contributed a cover of the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Lullaby&quot; to the Radio 1 Established 1967 compilation, again working with producer Gavin Monaghan, which was released on 1 October 2007. Shortly after this, Editors played a 75-minute set for the BBC Electric Proms at KOKO in London with backing from a classical string quartet. In November, they released &quot;The Racing Rats&quot; as the third single off the album. Editors played it live on &#x27;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&#x27; and it helped the song reach number 26 in the UK Charts. It also reached number 12 in the Dutch Top 40, the band&#x27;s highest ever single charting outside of the UK at that point.

For the first two months of 2008, Editors played 30 shows on a tour across America and Canada. During the tour Editors were nominated for a Brit Award, in the Best British Group Category. Also as a result of the nomination, one of the North American tour dates had to be cancelled, as the band had to return to London to attend the prize ceremony. A month later, Editors announced &quot;Push Your Head Towards the Air&quot; to be the fourth single from &quot;An End Has a Start&quot;. This release was a limited special edition which was ineligible to chart. Along with this release Editors engaged in their biggest and most extensive British tour to date. They played arenas such as the 12,000 capacity National Indoor Arena in Birmingham and two sold out dates in London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace.

In June, they released &quot;Bones&quot; as a download only single in Continental Europe to coincide with the summer festival season, the video of which was directed by the band&#x27;s bassist Russell Leetch. Shortly afterwards, Editors played at the Glastonbury Festival, playing on the pyramid stage for the first time. The band then played their second major support slot of their history supporting R.E.M. on a 16 date summer tour across Europe alongside their festival dates which included the headlining of the Lowlands Festival in August.

===&quot;In This Light and on This Evening&quot; (2009–2010)===

Lead singer Smith revealed that the band will explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound. Before January 2009, Editors had written around eighteen new songs for the new album and they have been described as some of the most synthetic, raw and anthemic songs they have written to date. In October the band went to the studio to record some demos. The band spent the first week of April recording the album and on 8 April, they released a short video with information about the recording process. It announced that Mark &#x27;Flood&#x27; Ellis would be the producer for the album. Earlier on in the year, the sound of the album was said to have a very electric feel; the band often using the Terminator theme song as a reference.

On 2 June 2009, it was announced that the new album title would be &quot;In This Light and on This Evening&quot; and that they would be the first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood&#x27;s heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop and post-punk sound to Editors&#x27; production.

The album was released on 12 October and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Alongside the album, the band released lead single &quot;Papillon&quot; and it led them to their first taste of number one success outside the UK, with the song hitting the top position in Belgium and being certified Gold in the process. After releasing singles &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Love&quot;, &quot;Last Day&quot; and &quot;Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool&quot; to limited chart success, it was announced that their unreleased song &quot;No Sound But the Wind&quot; would appear on the &quot;New Moon soundtrack&quot;. A live version of the song was later released in continental Europe in September 2010 and again achieved the same success as &quot;Papillon&quot; in Belgium, going to number 1 and being certified Gold.

In November 2010 it was confirmed that a boxset called &quot;Unedited&quot; compiling the first 3 albums, as well as b-sides and previously unreleased songs on 7 12&quot; records, 7 CDs and 7 MP3 albums, alongside a book of photos and words, would be released in early 2011. The boxset included the full band version of &quot;No Sound But The Wind&quot;, demos of &quot;Camera&quot; and &quot;These Streets Are Still Home To Me&quot;, and an unreleased version of &quot;The Weight of the World&quot;, called &quot;Every Little Piece&quot;.

===&quot;The Weight of Your Love&quot; and Urbanowicz&#x27;s departure (2011–2014)===

On 26 November 2010, Smith announced on the band&#x27;s website that they had started work on a new album, that it would again be produced by Flood, and that they were recording &quot;in stages over 2011&quot;, and that first rehearsals started in &quot;a matter of days&quot;.

On 26 March 2011, Editors performed their first tour date of the year at the Royal Albert Hall as the headline act for the penultimate show in the 2011 Teenage Cancer Trust, during which they showcased two new songs, &quot;Two Hearted Spider&quot; and &quot;The Sting&quot;. In October 2011, Editors played their first shows ever in Latin America with two dates in Mexico City.

In October 2011, Smith spoke to Q Radio about the new album. &quot;It&#x27;s still going to be fairly electronic, I think, compared to our earlier records. So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think we just need to, kind of, build on that... with a nod to our past as well. It&#x27;s our fourth record and we don&#x27;t want to feel like we&#x27;re doing the same thing again.&quot;

On 22 November 2011, Russell Leetch, the band&#x27;s bassist posted on the band&#x27;s official site saying they have seven songs ready to record and some more ideas &quot;floating around&quot; and that the album &quot;will be with you next year.&quot;

On 16 April 2012, it was announced that Chris Urbanowicz had left the group due to a difference in musical direction.

Following Urbanowicz&#x27;s departure the band played their first shows as a five piece with new members Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams in Birmingham, UK on 26 and 27 June 2012. On 29 June, they played at Main Square Festival in Arras, France, and on 30 June they headlined Rock Werchter festival in Belgium. At the shows they played new versions of &quot;Two Hearted Spider&quot; and &quot;The Sting&quot; as well as two new songs, &quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;Nothing&quot;.

On 8 April 2013, Smith stated, via his official Twitter account, that &quot;the record is being mastered today. it&#x27;s finished. done.&quot;

On 6 May 2013 Zane Lowe stated, via his official Twitter account, that the new Editors record would be entitled &quot;The Weight of Your Love&quot;. The first single for this album is &quot;A Ton of Love&quot;. In February 2014 the band released their fourth single, &quot;Sugar&quot;.

During 2014, Elliott Williams left the band for a period of touring to work on his own music project YdotOdotU, supporting The 1975. The band continued to tour with musician Nicholas Willes.

===&quot;In Dream&quot; (2014–2018)===
In October 2014, the band reconvened in Scotland to work on their fifth album. During a session supporting Andy Burrows on Jo Wiley&#x27;s Radio 2 show, Tom Smith confirmed the album&#x27;s songs had been written.

On 20 April 2015, the band released a new song entitled &#x27;No Harm&#x27; for free download. The song later became available through retailers, and on 11 May, its official video was posted on their YouTube channel. On 18 June, they released a video for the album&#x27;s lead single, &#x27;Marching Orders&#x27;. The video, directed by Rahi Rezvani (as was &#x27;No Harm&#x27;), was filmed in the Western Highlands of Scotland. The song was released on 19 June for digital download, and a limited run of 300 12&quot; vinyl test pressings were distributed randomly throughout Oxfam stores.

On 15 July 2015, the band announced the album &quot;In Dream&quot; via Facebook. It is the first Editors record to feature a duet. The third single and video &#x27;Life is a Fear&#x27; got its first play on Zane Lowe&#x27;s Apple Music Beats1 radio show on 11 August 2015. Its video, again directed by Rahi Rezvani, was uploaded to YouTube on the same day. On 22 September, Editors shared &#x27;The Law&#x27;, an album track which features Rachel Goswell of Slowdive.

The fifth album &quot;In Dream&quot;, produced by Editors themselves and mixed by Alan Moulder, was released on 2 October 2015. It marks the band&#x27;s collaboration with the Iranian born Dutch photographer, film and music video director Rahi Rezvani who also directed the video for &#x27;Ocean of Night&#x27;, released on 24 November. In October 2015, Editors together with Brussels Beer Project has released their own beer &#x27;Salvation&#x27;, named after a track on their album &quot;In Dream&quot;.

In support of the album the band embarked on a 42-date tour, playing throughout October, November and December in the UK, Ireland and Europe. Editors supported Manic Street Preachers across the UK on the 20th anniversary tour of the album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;. They also performed at Glastonbury, Bråvalla, Rock Werchter, Bilbao BBK Live 2016 and more than 20 festivals.

===&quot;Violence&quot; (2018–2019)===

Editors released their sixth album, &quot;Violence&quot;, on 9 March 2018. The lead single, &#x27;Magazine&#x27;, premiered on Jo Whiley&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show on 15 January 2018. The second single &quot;Hallelujah (So Low)&quot; premiered on Annie Mac&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show on 21 February 2018.

===&quot;Black Gold&quot; (2019–2022)===
In 2019, the band released their first compilation album, &quot;Black Gold&quot;, featuring 13 tracks from across their career along with three new songs: &quot;Black Gold&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Upside Down&quot;, which were produced by Jacknife Lee. The deluxe edition of the release featured eight stripped-down acoustic versions of previously released material under the title &quot;Distance: The Acoustic Recordings&quot;. The release was followed by a 2020 best of tour.

===&quot;EBM&quot; (2022–present)===

On 20 April 2022 the band released the single &quot;Heart Attack&quot;, and announced the addition of Benjamin John Power, who had previously worked with the band on the &quot;Violence&quot; album, as an official band member. On 22 September 2022, the band released their seventh album, &quot;EBM&quot;.

==Musical style==
Editors&#x27; own variation of dark indie guitar rock draws on influences from both older and contemporary bands. Their influences include Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Joy Division, the Strokes, the Walkmen, Elbow, and R.E.M. The band draw their musical style particularly from the latter two bands&#x27; debut albums &quot;Asleep in the Back&quot; and &quot;Murmur&quot;. Smith has commented that &quot;we&#x27;re dark and moody so yeah we build on the sound of the likes of Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen and The Chameleons... Obviously we were too young when these bands came out, so it&#x27;s only more recently that we discovered them.&quot; Upon Editors&#x27; first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.

Editors&#x27; first album, &quot;The Back Room&quot;, was described as having a wiry and raw sound, which led it to being famously dubbed &#x27;dark disco&#x27; by the NME. This sound was created by the use of synthesisers, catchy guitar riffs and simple, ambiguous lyrics. &quot;An End Has a Start&quot; showed progression to a new &#x27;bigger&#x27; sound. This new sound was created by adding more textured layers to the songs as well as incorporating new forms of music into them. These include the adding of a choir in &quot;Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors&quot; and the inclusion of the sounds of the band playing Hide-and-seek in the song &quot;Spiders&quot;.

Lead singer Smith announced that the band would explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound. The new sound materialised itself on the third album through the use of traditional synthesisers instead of the band&#x27;s previous use of guitars. The producer of &quot;In This Light and on This Evening&quot;, Flood also increased the importance of &quot;vibe&quot; in the music&#x27;s sound, making it darker than the previous two albums, while also attempting to make the album sound as if it had been recorded live.

While Smith tends to write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a collaborative effort. The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full &#x27;Editors song&#x27;. Smith has said that he purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so people can draw their own conclusions.

&quot;To us, it&#x27;s interesting if it has a darkness,&quot; said Smith in 2015. &quot;Whatever that is. On the lyric side of things, if I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn&#x27;t ring true for me. I don&#x27;t know why that is. People quite often say, &#x27;oh, you write these sad lyrics but you&#x27;re not a sad person&#x27; - and I&#x27;m not... I don&#x27;t think you need to be sad to write a sad song, everybody has a dark side.&quot;

<text>Mullumbimby, locally nicknamed Mullum, is a town in the Byron Shire in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. It promotes itself as &quot;The Biggest Little Town in Australia&quot;. The town lies at the foot of Mount Chincogan in the Brunswick Valley about 9 kilometres (5.5 miles) by road from the coast. At the , Mullumbimby and the surrounding area had a population of 3,589 people. It is known for its hippie subculture, and it has been referred to as &quot;Australia&#x27;s anti-vaxxer capital&quot;.

The Bundjalung people were the first people who lived in the area of Mullumbimby before the arrival of Europeans and remain the traditional owners of this place.

==History==

The first European to explore the area was Captain Henry Rous in 1828.

The area was used for dairy farming and fruit growing.

In 2022, the town was affected by floods.
===Origins and name===

In the 1850s Europeans had established a camp site at the junction of two arms of the Brunswick River. This grew to become a village and later the township of Mullumbimby. Mullumbimby was originally a centre for the timber industry. Notably, red cedar was collected in great quantities from around the area, a part of the far northern New South Wales&#x27; &quot;Big Scrub&quot;.

The town was a logical site for settlement by the timber hunters, as the Brunswick River is tidal in the town and navigable to that point, allowing logs to be floated down the river to its mouth at Brunswick Heads. The town&#x27;s central location gave access to most of the catchment area, and it provided the best position for bullock teams to cross the river with their wagons loaded with timber. At low tide it is still possible to see the shallow region where the bullocks made the crossing of the Brunswick River, under the current &quot;Federation Bridge&quot; on Murwillumbah Road.

The name &quot;Mullumbimby&quot;, meaning &quot;small round hill&quot;, was given to the district by Aboriginal people. The name is derived from the Bandjalung-Yugambeh dialect &quot;mulubinba&quot; (possibly also pertaining to a native fern which grew in the vicinity). Although some sources claim this is because of the proximity of Mount Chincogan, Chincogan is probably too prominent in the landscape to fit the name. An alternative theory is that it refers to another smaller and rounder hill. Suggestions include a medium hill to the north of Left Bank road, on which the towns water tower is located, or a smaller hill on Coolamon Scenic Drive, situated on the Daly Family Farm, near the current golf course. This latter hill is possibly supported by the abundant grass flats which surrounded it, known as Mullumbimby Grass. These naturally open grass flats, presumably hunting grounds for the local Bundjalung tribes, were later used by early European timber hunters to graze their bullock teams. The significance of this area lay not only in the feed it provided, but that some grasses in the naturally cleared area aided bullocks which had swallowed salt water when dragging timber into the surf for collection by nearby ships.

===Cultural history===
Mullumbimby was a separate municipality from 1908 until 1980 when it was forced to amalgamate with the Byron Shire. The Byron Shire Council offices were relocated to Mullumbimby in September 1996.

Byron Shire, including Mullumbimby and nearby Byron Bay, became a centre of alternative or counter culture alongside the extant mainstream culture in the 1970s and 1980s, and remains so today. The male choir Dustyesky performs Russian-language folk songs and received major coverage on the Russian television broadcaster Channel One.

Once the most notable specimens of the valuable timber trees had been collected (most notably red cedar, but also Australian Teak, Hoop Pine, Rosewood, Silky Oak and Black and Red Bean), the Big Scrub timber trade collapsed and Mullumbimby became primarily a farming community. Like many areas of the Big Scrub, allotments were given in Mullumbimby and the surrounding areas by the New South Wales government on the condition that the owner cleared the land for agricultural use. Beef and dairy, along with bananas and sugar cane have traditionally been the notable products of the area. However, the subdivision of many of the larger farms and the emergence of numerous small scale farmers has led to a higher diversity of products. A weekly farmers&#x27; market has been developed to exhibit local produce.

A static inverter plant of HVDC Directlink is located at Laverty&#x27;s Gap near Mullumbimby. This inverter plant was previously the site of a 288 kW hydroelectric power scheme that powered Mullumbimby, Byron Bay and Bangalow from 1926, using water from a weir in nearby Wilsons Creek. The scheme was the fourth hydro electric power station in NSW and only the fifth on mainland Australia. Powering Mullumbimby for the first time in 1925, the scheme made Mullumbimby one of the first country towns in NSW to receive electricity. Although decommissioned in 1990, it is now of state heritage significance. The hydroelectric scheme was designed by William Corin (1867–1929). The site is being considered for pumped-storage hydroelectricity.

The Mullumbimby Star, which was published under a number of names over its history, was a newspaper published in the town from 1902 to 1982.

==Heritage listings==
Mullumbimby has several heritage-listed sites and the controversial Slater mounds have been nominated as local heritage. The best known heritage sites include:
* Wilsons Creek Road: Mullumbimby Hydro-electric Power Station Complex

==Population==

In the 2021 Census, there were 3,589 people in Mullumbimby. 70.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England at 5.9%, New Zealand at 1.9% and Germany at 1.6%. 81.0% of people spoke only English at home. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 59.2%, followed by Not stated 10.3%, Catholic 7.7%, Anglican 5.9% and Buddhism 2.9%. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.8% of the population in 2016. English, Australian, Irish, Scottish and German are the most common ancestries.

==Geography==
Mullumbimby is about west of the Pacific Highway, near where the now closed Murwillumbah railway line crosses the Brunswick River. The line opened in 1894 and was closed in 2004 because of an argument over funding between federal and state politicians, despite community resistance across the region. Closure of the railway line between Murwillumbah and Casino has reduced transport options in the region.

The Brunswick River starts in Mullumbimby, at the meeting of Main Arm and Mullumbimby creeks.

Mullumbimby is close to the localities of Ocean Shores, Brunswick Heads and Wilsons Creek. Its hinterland area includes the locales of Goonengerry, Huonbrook, Koonyum Range, Main Arm, Montecollum, Palmwoods, Wanganui and Wilsons Creek and coincides with the postcode area of 2482 which has a diamond shape of around 35 km by 45 km.

The main geographical feature of Mullumbimby, Mount Chincogan, was a minor lava plug of the now extinct Tweed shield volcano. The nearby Mount Warning was the main plug.

==Stone arrangement==

Reported stones arrangement on the Slater mounds on the western side of Saddle Ridge is thought by some to date back to the Paleolithic Age, and pre-dates Stonehenge. The arrangements were communicated in the late 1930s by the Brunswick Heads headmaster to Mr Frederic Slater who attempted to make headlines across Australia with this as a highly significant Aboriginal site. Slater and some other researchers believe the inscriptions on the stones contain the earliest form of human language. Others regard this as pure pseudoscience. There is claimed to have been intentional destruction of the site and the 1930s-described stones have disappeared.

==Conspiracy theorism==
Mullumbimby is a hotspot for conspiracy theorists in Australia. Many locals are hippies or live alternative lifestyles. The town has low vaccination rates and many locals have protested against vaccines, 5G technology and water fluoridation amongst other causes.

==Health==

Mullumbimby is a hot spot for the anti-vaccination movement. As of 2013, the town″s vaccination rate was the lowest in Australia, with only 46% to 49% of children aged one, two and five years old in the 2482 postcode fully immunised, in contrast with a state average in the low 90s. In Mullumbimby, between 2015 and 2016 only 52% of five year olds were fully vaccinated, compared to the national average at the time of 92.9%. Richmond Valley, a region close to Mullumbimby, had the lowest overall vaccination rate, in part due to a high number of &quot;conscientious objectors&quot; to the practice. Health officials have cited education and timely reminders as key factors in improving the vaccination rate.

The Byron Shire, in which Mullumbimby is situated, is also the only remaining local government area in the Northern Rivers region to reject fluoridation of its water supply.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite state government-mandated restrictions, many businesses in Mullumbimby welcomed unvaccinated and unmasked individuals into their businesses, saying that the mandates imposed by the government were discriminatory.

==Sport and recreation==
The Mullumbimby Giants is the local rugby league club that competes in the Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League competition.

<text>Johann Wilhelm Ritter (16 December 1776 – 23 January 1810) was a German chemist, physicist and philosopher. He was born in Samitz (Zamienice) near Haynau (Chojnów) in Silesia (then part of Prussia, since 1945 in Poland), and died in Munich.

==Life and work==
Johann Wilhelm Ritter&#x27;s first involvement with science began when he was 14 years old. He became an apprentice to an apothecary in Liegnitz (Legnica), and acquired a deep interest in chemistry. He began medicine studies at the University of Jena in 1796. A self-taught scientist, he made many experimental researches on chemistry, electricity and other fields.

Ritter belonged to the German Romantic movement. He was personally acquainted with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Alexander von Humboldt, Johann Gottfried Herder and Clemens Brentano. He was strongly influenced by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, who was the main philosopher of the &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; movement. In 1801, Hans Christian Ørsted visited Jena and became his friend. Several of Ritter&#x27;s researches were later reported by Ørsted, who was also strongly influenced by the philosophical outlook of &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;.

Ritter&#x27;s first scientific researches concerned some galvanic phenomena. He interpreted the physiological effects observed by Luigi Galvani and other researchers as due to the electricity generated by chemical reactions. His interpretation is closer to the one accepted nowadays than those proposed by Galvani (“animal electricity”) and Alessandro Volta (electricity generated by metallic contact), but it was not accepted at the time. 

In 1800, shortly after the invention of the voltaic pile, William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle discovered that water could be decomposed by electricity. Shortly afterward, Ritter also discovered the same effect, independently. Besides that, he collected and measured the amounts of hydrogen and oxygen produced in the reaction. He also discovered the process of electroplating. In 1802 he built his first electrochemical cell, with 50 copper discs separated by cardboard disks moistened by a salt solution.

Ritter made several self-experiments applying the poles of a voltaic pile to his own hands, eyes, ears, nose and tongue. He also described the difference between the physiological effects of the two poles of the pile, although some of the effects he reported were not confirmed afterwards.

Many of Ritter&#x27;s researches were guided by a search for polarities in the several &quot;forces&quot; of nature, and for the relation between those &quot;forces&quot; – two of the assumptions of &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;. In 1801, after hearing about the discovery of &quot;heat rays&quot; (infrared radiation) by William Herschel (in 1800), Ritter looked for an opposite (cooling) radiation at the other end of the visible spectrum. He did not find exactly what he expected to find, but after a series of attempts he noticed that silver chloride was transformed faster from white to black when it was placed at the dark region of the Sun&#x27;s spectrum, close to its violet end. The &quot;chemical rays&quot; found by him were afterwards called ultraviolet radiation.

Some of Ritter&#x27;s researches were acknowledged as important scientific contributions, but he also claimed the discovery of many phenomena that were not confirmed by other researchers. For instance: he reported that the Earth had electric poles that could be detected by the motion of a bimetallic needle; and he claimed that he could produce the electrolysis of water using a series of magnets, instead of Volta&#x27;s piles.

Ritter had no regular income and never became a university professor, although in 1804 he was elected a member of the Bavarian Academy of Science (in Munich). He married in 1804 and had four children, but he was unable to provide the needs of his family. Plagued by financial difficulties and suffering from weak health (perhaps aggravated by his electrical self-experimentation), he died young in 1810, as a poor man.

<doc id="1288235" wikidata="Q1655586" url="?curid=1288235" title="Iain Matthews">
<text>Iain Matthews (born Ian Matthews MacDonald, 16 June 1946) is an English musician and singer-songwriter. He was an original member of the British folk rock band Fairport Convention from 1967 to 1969 before leaving to form his own band, Matthews Southern Comfort, which had a UK number one in 1970 with their cover of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Woodstock&quot;. In 1979, his recording of Terence Boylan&#x27;s &quot;Shake It&quot; reached No. 13 on the US charts.

Born in Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, Matthews was known in the 1960s as Ian MacDonald. He changed his name to Ian Matthews (his mother&#x27;s maiden name) in 1968 to avoid confusion with Ian McDonald of King Crimson. In 1989 he changed the spelling of his first name to Iain, and has been known as Iain Matthews ever since.

Influenced by both rock and roll and folk music, Matthews has performed solo and as a member of various bands. He was a member of Fairport Convention during the band&#x27;s early period when they were heavily influenced by American folk rock and sang on their first three albums before leaving in 1969. He initially embarked upon a solo career before forming the bands Matthews Southern Comfort and Plainsong. Later in his career he was also a member of the bands Hi-Fi, No Grey Faith, and More Than a Song. In the 2000s he twice revived Plainsong and Matthews Southern Comfort (MSC) and continues to tour regularly with the current version of MSC. A new MSC album, &quot;The New Mine,&quot; was released in March 2020, and a vinyl-only album &quot;Fake Tan&quot;, recorded with Norwegian band the Salmon Smokers, was released in September 2020.

In a career spanning over fifty years, Matthews has featured on over 100 albums. In 2018 he published an autobiography co-written with author and broadcaster Ian Clayton, &quot;Thro&#x27; My Eyes: A Memoir&quot;, about his life in the music industry.

==Origins==
Matthews&#x27; family moved to Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, when he was twelve years old. After leaving school at sixteen he worked as an apprentice signwriter for a local painting and decorating firm. During the British pop music explosion of the mid-1960s he sang with local bands in Scunthorpe. He moved to London in the spring of 1965 and took a job in a Carnaby Street shoe shop, Ravel. In 1966 he formed a trio, The Pyramid (later just &#x27;Pyramid&#x27;), a short-lived English surf music band, with Al Jackson and Steve Hiett (born 1940, died 2018). Hiett later became a world-renowned fashion photographer. The Pyramid released one single, &quot;Summer of Last Year&quot;, in January 1967 on Deram Records. A remaining song, &quot;Me About You,&quot; surfaced on Matthews&#x27; &quot;Orphans &amp; Outcasts Volume 3&quot; compilation album in 1999.

==Fairport Convention==
In the winter of 1967 Matthews was recruited by Ashley Hutchings as a vocalist for Fairport Convention, where he sang with Judy Dyble on their self-titled first album &quot;Fairport Convention&quot; and with Sandy Denny on &quot;What We Did On Our Holidays&quot;. During the recording of &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; in 1969, as Fairport increasingly drew their material from a traditional British folk repertoire, Matthews was not invited to a recording session. After a discussion with producer Joe Boyd and Hutchings, he left the band and departed on a musical direction of his own.

==Matthews Southern Comfort==

In 1969 Matthews recorded his debut solo album, &quot;Matthews&#x27; Southern Comfort&quot;, which was rooted in American country music and rockabilly. He made the album with ex-Fairport colleagues Richard Thompson, Simon Nicol and Ashley Hutchings, plus guitarist Mark Griffiths, drummers Ray Duffy and Gerry Conway, pedal steel guitarist Gordon Huntley, and keyboardists Dolly Collins and Roger Coulam. This was his first significant experience recording as a songwriter. The band also performed Neil Young and Ian and Sylvia covers. He formed a working band, Matthews Southern Comfort (using the name of his first album, but without the apostrophe), and released two more albums, &quot;Second Spring&quot; (1970 – UK #52) and &quot;Later That Same Year&quot; (1970).

The band went through several line-ups and toured extensively for the next two years. They had one commercial success with Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Woodstock&quot;, which was a number one hit in the UK Singles Chart in October 1970. It received heavy airplay in Canada, reaching No. 5, as well as peaking at No. 23 on the Billboard singles charts in the United States in 1971. Matthews left Southern Comfort and the band released three albums of their own on Harvest Records.

==Plainsong==
In 1971 Matthews recorded two solo albums, (&quot;If You Saw Thro&#x27; My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Tigers Will Survive&quot;), on Vertigo Records. Under the sponsorship of former Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith, and in the company of like-minded British semi-folkies (notably ex-Fairporter Richard Thompson), he formed the band Plainsong with Andy Roberts, previously of The Liverpool Scene. The band&#x27;s line-up consisted of Matthews, Roberts, guitarist Dave Richards and American bassist Bob Ronga.

In 1972 Plainsong released &quot;In Search of Amelia Earhart&quot;. The album included a cover of Dave McEnery&#x27;s &quot;Amelia Earhart&#x27;s Last Flight&quot;, plus a song by Matthews, &quot;True Story of Amelia Earhart&#x27;s Last Flight&quot;. The song is based on research that suggested Amelia Earhart may have been spying on Japanese bases in the Pacific islands. It also included &quot;Even the Guiding Light&quot;, an answer to Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Meet on the Ledge&quot;.
==Moving around==
After Plainsong collapsed as a result of a bandmate&#x27;s alcoholism, and with his musical career now based in Los Angeles, Matthews released several more albums with &quot;ad hoc&quot; bands: &quot;Valley Hi&quot; (1973), produced by Michael Nesmith (formerly of the Monkees); &quot;Journeys from Gospel Oak&quot; and &quot;Some Days You Eat The Bear&quot; (1974); &quot;Go For Broke&quot; (1976) and &quot;Hit and Run&quot; (1977). None of these met with commercial success. &quot;Valley Hi&quot; featured a cover of the Steve Young song &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot;, arranged by Matthews and Nesmith with multitracked harmony, all parts of which were sung by Matthews. This version became famous after being covered live by the Eagles in 1980 and released on &quot;Eagles Live&quot;. His albums were not successful, and Matthews moved from Elektra Records to Columbia Records and from Columbia to the small Rockburgh label, where he scored a hit single in 1978 with a cover of Terence Boylan&#x27;s &quot;Shake It&quot; which reached No. 13 on the US charts and No. 6 in Canada.

He had a moderately successful follow-up with Robert Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Give Me an Inch&quot;. The North American rights for his album &quot;Stealin&#x27; Home&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Siamese Friends&quot; were held by the small Canadian label Mushroom, and when label owner Shelly Siegel died in 1979 Matthews&#x27; association with the label ended. His song &quot;Shake It&quot; is heard at the beginning of the 1980 movie &quot;Little Darlings&quot; and in the game &quot;The Warriors&quot; from Rockstar Games.

Matthews&#x27; official website states that at this point he &quot;had been struggling for nearly 15 years&quot; and was still living hand to mouth, with nothing to show for his efforts &quot;but a string of out-of-print albums and the loyalty of those musicians and fans who shared his vision.&quot; He moved from Los Angeles to Seattle, where he teamed up with David Surkamp, formerly of the St. Louis band Pavlov&#x27;s Dog, to form the power pop band Hi-Fi. This band&#x27;s repertoire included Matthews originals, Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; and Prince&#x27;s &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;. Matthews worked in an A&amp;R capacity at Island Records and then Windham Hill Records.

==Later career==
From 1977 Fairport Convention held an annual reunion festival at Cropredy in Oxfordshire and in the mid-1980s there was interest in reviving the band and recording new material. Matthews was invited to perform as a part of the band at the 1986 Cropredy Festival and this led to an album, &quot;Walking a Changing Line&quot; (1988) on Windham Hill Records, a tribute to Jules Shear of Jules and the Polar Bears. Matthews moved to Austin, Texas and recorded several albums for a series of German independent labels. He appeared with Andy Roberts at the 1992 Cambridge Folk Festival, which inspired the first of what became several versions of Plainsong.

In 2000 Matthews moved to Amsterdam, where he became involved in independent music projects and collaborations, including the Sandy Denny tribute band No Grey Faith and another revival of Plainsong. (&#x27;No Grey Faith&#x27; being an anagram of &quot;Fotheringay,&quot; the name of the castle in Northamptonshire in which Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned, the title of a song that Denny had recorded for Fairport Convention, and the name of a short-lived band Denny had led in the 1970s.) Matthews moved to Horst in the Netherlands and in 2008 produced &quot;Joy Mining&quot; with the Dutch jazz ensemble Searing Quartet. In September 2010 he released the first Matthews Southern Comfort album in 40 years and returned to a major record label.

Since 2003 Matthews has worked with Dutch pianist and composer Egbert Derix. They met when Matthews, a jazz fan, came to a concert of Derix&#x27;s Searing Quartet in Cambrinus (Horst, The Netherlands). Matthews invited Derix to join the 2003 tour of his 1970 album &quot;If You Saw Thro&#x27; My Eyes&quot; and they played a series of concerts with Eric Coenen (bass), Arthur Lijten (drums) and Ad Vanderveen (guitar). After the tour Matthews and Derix started writing together, resulting in the 2008 album &quot;Joy Mining.&quot; Matthews and Derix started their own label, MatriX. In 2012, the Iain Matthews/Egbert Derix album &quot;In the Now&quot; was released by Verve Records. &quot;Joy Mining&quot; and &quot;In the Now&quot; had separate releases in the United Kingdom and United States.

In December 2011, Matthews performed as Matthews Southern Comfort with his Dutch band at the 2nd Great British Folk Festival at Butlins Skegness and performed a set of old and new songs. In January 2014 he toured as part of the Gene Clark No Other band, performing Gene Clark&#x27;s album &quot;No Other&quot; with singers including Robin Pecknold of the Fleet Foxes

In January–February 2015, Matthews and Derix toured in California to promote the US releases of their albums. Dutch filmmakers Peter Jong and Olivier Hamaker made a documentary about the making of &quot;In the Now&quot;. Matthews can also be heard on Egbert Derix&#x27; solo album &quot;Paintings in Minor Lila&quot; (2012), on which the music of British progressive rock band Marillion is featured. The album had contributions by Matthews, Marillion singers Fish and Steve Hogarth, and Supertramp saxophonist John Helliwell. Matthews was guest vocalist in 2011 on the Helliwell/Derix Quintet tour in The Netherlands. Matthews and Derix co-wrote eight songs for Matthews&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Art of Obscurity&quot; (2013).

==Thro&#x27; My Eyes: A Memoir==
In 2018 Matthews released an autobiography, &quot;Thro’ My Eyes: A Memoir&quot;. The book was co-written with Featherstone-based author and broadcaster, Ian Clayton. Clayton was contacted in 2010 by Matthews who had read his book &quot;Bringing It all Back Home&quot;, described by Record Collector magazine as &quot;one of the best books about popular music ever written&quot;. It was several years before the project came to fruition as a co-written book.

&quot;Thro’ My Eyes: A Memoir&quot; was published by Pontefract-based Route Publishing in August 2018 in two editions, Standard and Deluxe. The Deluxe edition included an exclusive 2-CD compilation of 23 songs from Matthews’ career. The book describes Matthews’ life and musical career, from his beginnings in Barton-upon-Humber and Scunthorpe; moving to London in the 1960s and joining Fairport Convention; forming Matthews Southern Comfort in 1970 and having a #1 hit with their version of Joni Mitchell’s &quot;Woodstock&quot;; forming Plainsong with Andy Roberts in 1972; spending years in America as a solo artist; and returning to Europe in 2000 to continue making albums and touring. 

Matthews also described watching and playing football as a boy in Scunthorpe, a failed trial as a potential professional footballer with Bradford Park Avenue, and his life-long love of Manchester United. A live concert recording of Plainsong in Paris in 2007 revealed him telling the audience that the words of his song &quot;Busby&#x27;s Babes&quot;, from the 1990 album &quot;Pure And Crooked,&quot; were displayed in the Manchester United Museum.

Matthews and Clayton promoted the book in 2019 with a concert tour of 11 venues in England and Scotland, entitled &quot;Words And Music&quot;. in which Matthews and Clayton talked about episodes from the book and Matthews performed live. He was joined on stage on one night at The Greys in Brighton by former Plainsong bandmate Andy Roberts. A paperback version of the book, with new artwork and an updated discography, was published by Route in March 2021.

<text>Kamphaeng Phet is a town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in central Thailand, former capital of the Kamphaeng Phet Province. It covers the complete &quot;tambon&quot; Nai Mueang of the Mueang Kamphaeng Phet district. As of 2020, it has a population of 28,817.

==Gallery==




== History ==
Kamphaeng Phet was an ancient outpost town during the Sukhothai period, as evidenced by the city walls and fortifications that remain today. Before the creation of the city, legends says that there were two cities present in the location; Chakangrao (ชากังราว) and Nakhon Chum (นครชุม). Chakangrao was built on the east bank of the Ping River while Nakhon Chum was built on the west bank of the Ping River.

Kamphaeng Phet received municipality status on March 11, 1936. When the municipality was established, it had an operation area of 4.5 square kilometers. Later in 1966, it expanded to an area of 14.9 square kilometers.

<text>Krabi (, ) is the capital of and main town in Krabi Province (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;), on the west coast of southern Thailand, where the Krabi River flows into Phang Nga Bay. The town lies south of Bangkok, and as of 2020, has a population of 32,644. As in much of southern Thailand, the local economy centres largely on tourism.

== History ==
At the start of the Rattanakosin period in the late eighteenth century, when the capital was finally settled at Bangkok, an elephant kraal was established in Krabi by order of Chao Phraya Nakhon (Noi), the governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat, which was by then a part of the Thai Kingdom. He sent his vizier, the Phra Palad, to oversee this task, which was to ensure a regular supply of elephants for the larger town. So many followers immigrated in the steps of the Phra Palad that soon Krabi had a large community in three different boroughs: Pakasai, Khlong Pon, and Pak Lao. In 1872, King Chulalongkorn elevated these to town status, called Krabi, a word that preserves in its meaning the monkey symbolism of the old standard. The town&#x27;s first governor was Luang Thep Sena, though it continued for a while as a dependency of Nakhon Si Thammarat. This was changed in 1875, when Krabi was raised to a fourth-level town in the old system of Thai government. Administrators then reported directly to the central government in Bangkok, and Krabi&#x27;s history as an entity separate from other provinces had begun.

==Administration==
The town covers the &quot;tambon&quot; Paknam and Krabi Yai of Krabi District, and is divided into 10 communities (&quot;chumchon&quot;).

== Climate ==
Facing the Andaman Sea, like Phuket, Krabi has a tropical monsoon climate, and is subject to a ten-month rainy season between March and December, often with sustained heavy rains for days at a time during the monsoons. Krabi&#x27;s highest ever recorded temperature was on 31 March 2023. Its lowest temperature was recorded on 11 January 2009: .

== Demographics ==
Since 2005, the population of Krabi has been greatly increasing.
== Tourism ==

Much of the province has been given over to several national parks. Top destinations are Hat Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park, Ao Nang, Railay, and Ko Phi Phi. The province includes over 80 smaller islands such as Ko Lanta and Phi Phi, well known to adventurers, yachtsmen, scuba-divers, snorkelers, and day-trippers from Phuket. Krabi&#x27;s beaches attract both native Thai people and foreigners alike.

Ko Lanta National Park, also in Krabi Province, includes several coral-fringed islands with well-known diving sites. The largest island, Ko Lanta Yai, is the site of park headquarters, and is also home to &quot;Chao Le&quot;, or sea gypsies, who sustain themselves largely through fishing. The islands are best visited during the drier months of October through April.

Kayaking, sailing, bird watching, snorkeling are also among top activities. In the interior, two predominantly mainland national parks, Khao Phanom Bencha National Park and Than Bokkhorani, offer inland scenic attractions including waterfalls and caves, and opportunities for trekking, bird watching, and eco-tours.

The rock faces at Railay Beach near Ao Nang have attracted climbers from all over the world and each year are the venue for the Rock and Fire Festival in mid April. There are several rock climbing schools at Railay Beach. The rock is limestone and has characteristic pockets, overhangs and faces. Railay has numerous multi-pitch areas most of which start from the beach itself. A famous example is &quot;Humanality&quot;. In addition, deep water soloing is popular on the numerous nearby rocky islands accessible by long-tail boat. Another popular destination is the Fossil Shell Beach located at Ban Laem Pho. The beach is famous for its fossilized snail shells, dwellers of the freshwater swamp that covered this area some 40 million years ago.

==Transport==
Since 1999 the town has been served by the international Krabi Airport. Passing through the town is Phetkasem Road (Thailand Route 4).

<doc id="1288254" wikidata="Q1285503" url="?curid=1288254" title="McGill station">
<text>McGill station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in the downtown core of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro.

It is currently the third busiest station (after Berri–UQAM station and Guy–Concordia station) in the network measured by number of passengers entering the system. Prior to 2002, it was the busiest station in the network. From 2025, the station will be served by the Réseau express métropolitain (REM).

== Overview ==

Designed by Crevier, Lemieux, Mercier and Caron, it is a normal side platform station built in open cut under boul. De Maisonneuve, with two ticket halls joined by corridors that surround the platforms. The station is named after, and is located adjacent to McGill University.

The ticket halls are linked to the platforms by four stairways per platform, including the shortest escalators in the network. The station has large pillars, which were originally painted orange, but painted in beer bottle green colour in the late 1990s. In January 2010 the STM repainted the station in its original colours being orange pillars and yellow walls.

As an important part of the underground city, the station has had its mezzanine level substantially enlarged since its opening, by construction of new buildings around the station: the western end of the mezzanine was added with the construction of the Tour BNP and Eaton Centre, while the southern corridor between the ticket halls was added to link the Promenades de la Cathédrale (now known as Promenades Cathédrale) with the station. 

No fewer than six buildings are directly connected to the station via underground city. The station has a further six direct street-level entrances, all of which are integrated into the façades of other buildings. A seventh entrance in a separate building was added in 2023 to provide elevator access, making the station accessible.

Among this busy station&#x27;s amenities include several shops and services directly in the station, including a Tim Hortons, Second Cup, a Scotiabank, two Pizza Shops, a web terminal, and MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train. This was second station after Berri-UQAM to have them installed. At one time an &quot;open-concept&quot; branch of the Montreal Public Library was located next to the exit onto rue Université.
== Renovation and upgrade works ==
In March 2012, the station underwent renovation work that included the replacement of Travertine tiles covering surfaces of the whole station, spanning over . Other work included replacing the lighting system, fixing columns, beams, and concrete slabs and replacing granite staircases and handrails. By the end of 2016, modernized signage has been put in place, flooring has been completely replaced and the stained glass installation underwent a restoration and was put back in place.

In 2020, work began on making the station universally accessible, ahead of the arrival of the REM. The project involves the construction of a new entrance building, two elevators, new public artwork and refurbishment of three of the other entrances. This was estimated to cost around $58 million.

On April 3, 2023, McGill became the 26th accessible metro station in the network, with the completion of the refurbishment work.

== Réseau express métropolitain station ==

In November 2016, CDPQ Infra announced that the proposed Réseau express métropolitain (REM) system would connect to the Green line at McGill. As with the 1980s Line 3 proposal, the REM will use the historic Mont Royal tunnel to head north from downtown. The REM station will be located under McGill College Avenue, and a pedestrian tunnel will connect it to the Green Line station concourse, as well as the wider Underground City. CDPQ Infra indicate that the station will be the 2nd busiest station on the REM, with over 25,000 passengers per day.

Construction on the McGill REM station began in September 2018. In this location, the Mont Royal tunnel is not bored through solid rock, and therefore work to strengthen the historic tunnel was required. , the REM station is planned to open in October 2025.

== Entrances ==
The station has seven entrances:
: 690, De Maisonneuve Ouest
: 640, De Maisonneuve Ouest
: 811, De Maisonneuve Ouest
: 2055, Robert-Bourassa Boulevard 
: 2021, Avenue Union
: 1445, Av. Union and La Baie
: 705, De Maisonneuve Ouest (elevator access)

== Architecture and art ==

This station contains several pieces of artwork.

The most prominent is Nicolas Sollogoub&#x27;s &quot;Montreal Scenes Circa 1830&quot;, depicting the industrial era in the city as well as its early mayors and civic arms. This set of five stained-glass murals was donated by Macdonald Tobacco, and installed in 1974. Maurice Savoie created a set of terra cotta murals depicting fruit and flowers, surrounding the entrance to Eaton&#x27;s (now the Complexe Les Ailes). This were installed when the station opened in 1966. 

The construction of the Promenades de la Cathédrale in 1992 brought two new works of art, a light sculpture called &quot;Passūs&quot; by Murray MacDonald, and an installation of an aerial view of Montreal complete with miniature figures of the buildings, by art collective Les Industries perdues. The latter work is entitled &quot;To rise, we must push against the ground onto which we have fallen.&quot;

Work to install elevators in 2023 was accompanied by a new artwork in the 811 De Maisonneuve Ouest entrance, a triptych of works in painted aluminum by Mathieu Lévesque entitled &quot;Vestiges&quot;. These commemorate the nearby Golden Square Mile.

Finally, a tapestry by Kelvin McAvoy depicting the life of James McGill was donated by Canadian Universal Limited Insurance in 1969; however, after being vandalized, it was removed by the company for restoration, and then given as a perpetual loan to McGill University instead, where it is now exhibited at the McLennan Library.

==Origin of the name==

McGill is named for McGill University. Founded in 1821 with money and on land bequeathed by Scottish-Canadian businessman James McGill, this is one of Canada&#x27;s most prestigious institutions of higher education.

<text>Trat (, ), also spelt Trad, is a town in Thailand, capital of Trat province and the Mueang Trat district. The town is in the east of Thailand, at the mouth of the Trat River, near the border with Cambodia.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Trat&quot; is believed to derive from &quot;Krat&quot; (), the Thai name for the tree &quot;Dipterocarpus intricatus,&quot; common to the region and used to make brooms. It is also spelt &quot;Trad&quot;.

== History ==
Trat was already an important seaport in the Kingdom of Ayutthaya.

Under King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), Trat and Chanthaburi province were briefly occupied by the French. In a complicated exchange of territory, Trat (and Chanthaburi) was returned on March 23, 1906, but Thailand relinquished the area around Siem Reap and Sisophon in present-day Cambodia.

When the Vietnamese pushed the Khmer Rouge out of Cambodia in 1985, Pol Pot fled to Thailand and made his headquarters in a plantation villa near Trat. It was built for him by the Thai Army and nicknamed &quot;Office 87&quot;.

== Geography ==
Trat Province is located in the eastern part of the central region of Thailand, in the extreme southeast of Thailand near the border with Cambodia. It is just over 300 km from the capital Bangkok.

=== Climate ===
Trat experiences a tropical monsoon climate, with the dry season taking place from November to April and the wet season lasting from May to October.
== Economy ==
Trat, favored by its proximity to the Cambodian border, is of some importance as a trading city. The area around Trat is rich in gemstone mines, whose yield (rubies and sapphires) is processed right in the town. Fruit growing is also important: durian, rambutan and mangosteen are the main products.

For tourists, Trat is more interesting as a starting point to the large islands of Ko Chang and Ko Mak.

The city of Trat had 10,207 inhabitants .

<doc id="1288265" wikidata="Q2742553" url="?curid=1288265" title="Lawyers in Love">
<text>Lawyers in Love is the seventh album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1983 by Asylum Records. It was Browne&#x27;s fourth straight Top 10 album and stayed on the charts for 33 weeks, peaking at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Out of eight tracks, four were released as singles. The title song reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was accompanied by one of Browne&#x27;s first music videos released on MTV.

==Background and recording==
In the intervening years between 1980&#x27;s &quot;Hold Out&quot; and &quot;Lawyers in Love&quot;, Browne had released the single &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Baby&quot;, which became his biggest commercial hit to date, peaking at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Lawyers in Love&quot; was the first Browne album since his 1972 self-titled debut not to feature guitarist David Lindley. Replacing Lindley were guitarists Rick Vito and Danny Kortchmar.

Co-producer and engineer Greg Ladanyi explained the album&#x27;s unusual recording sessions: &quot;For this record, Jackson wanted to be downtown, where the people were. So we found a warehouse in downtown L.A., and just turned it into a studio. We set it up so that the band could play without the distractions of a normal studio because, for the most part, Jackson was writing the songs – in terms of the key changes and chord changes – based on what he was hearing when the band was playing. There was no &#x27;Okay, it&#x27;s take one or take two.&#x27; We kept the tape rolling just about all the time. And there are very few overdubs.&quot;

On the track &quot;Downtown&quot;, Browne ad-libs a line to the melody of the Petula Clark song of the same name at the end of the song.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Critic Robert Christgau called the album &quot;a satire on, celebration of, and lament for the upper-middle classmates an Orange County liberal knows like he knows his neighbor&#x27;s backyard&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Christopher Connelly felt that the record was &quot;a more nervy, intelligent LP than its predecessor&quot; and &quot;a welcome widening of perspective that allows Browne to escape, once and for all, the L.A. albatross that has hung around his neck.&quot; However, he despised the &quot;wretched&quot; 5:20 of &quot;antinuke agitprop&quot; that is &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t True&quot; for displaying the worst traits of the album: &quot;No quarrel here with the sentiments he&#x27;s expressing, but to gravely intone, &#x27;There always has been and always will be war,&#x27; over a &#x27;Kum BaYa&#x27;-like coo of &#x27;Say it isn&#x27;t true&#x27; — surely, you say to yourself, he can&#x27;t be that stupid.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann referred to Browne&#x27;s often overlooked songcrafting, but wrote &quot;the craft, and the familiar tightness of Browne&#x27;s veteran studio/live band, couldn&#x27;t hide the essentially retread nature of much of this material.&quot;

===Commercial===
&quot;Lawyers in Love&quot; reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified as a gold record in 1983 and platinum in 2001 by the RIAA.

<text>The CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon is a United States Air Force -class freefall Cluster Bomb Unit. It was developed and produced by Textron Defense Systems. A CBU-97 used in conjunction with the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser guidance tail kit is converted to a precision-guided weapon, and the combination is designated CBU-105.

==Overview==
The CBU-97 consists of an SUU-66/B tactical munition dispenser that contains 10 BLU-108 submunitions. Each submunition contains four hockey-puck-shaped sensor-fused projectiles called Skeets. These detect target vehicles, such as tanks, armored personnel carriers, trucks and other support vehicles, and fire an explosively-formed penetrator downwards at them.

==Operation==

The 40 Skeets scan an area of using infrared and laser sensors, seeking targets by pattern-matching. When a Skeet finds a target it fires an explosively-formed penetrator to destroy it. If a Skeet fails to find a target, it self-destructs above the ground; if this fails, a back-up timer disables the Skeet. These features are intended to avoid later civilian casualties from unexploded munitions, and result in an unexploded-ordnance rate of less than 1%.

As the CBU-97 approaches its designated aim-point, the dispenser skin is severed into three panels by an explosive cutting charge. The slipstream peels away these panels, exposing the 10 BLU-108 submunitions. An airbag ejects the forward five submunitions, then five in the aft bay. Following a preset timeline, the submunitions deploy parachutes so that they are spaced about apart. Then each submunition releases its chute, fires a rocket motor that stops its descent and spins it on its longitudinal axis, and releases Skeets 90 degrees apart, in pairs. Each spinning Skeet makes a coning motion that allows it to scan a circular area on the ground.

The laser sensor detects changes in apparent terrain height such as the contour of a vehicle. At the same time, infrared sensors detect heat signatures, such as those emitted by the engine of a vehicle. When the combination of height contours and heat signatures indicative of a target are detected, the Skeet detonates, firing an explosively-formed penetrator (EFP) down into the target at high speed, sufficient to penetrate armor plating and destroy what is protected by it. Even well-armored vehicles such as main battle tanks, while having massive armor protection on the front and sides, are only lightly armored above, and relatively easily penetrated. Each bomb can spread penetrators over an area of or more. According to an ABC News consultant, an attack by this bomb would effectively stop an armored convoy moving down a road. While the bomb was designed during the Cold War for fighter-bombers flying at low altitude below radar cover to attack Soviet tanks, a single B-52 high altitude heavy bomber can destroy an entire armored division with these bombs, where in the past dozens of aircraft would have had to drop hundreds of bombs for the same effect.

The CBU-97, or CBU-105 version, is deployed by tactical aircraft from altitudes of Above Ground Level (AGL) at speeds of .

==History==
The weapon has been in production since 1992 and it was first deployed, but not used, during Operation Allied Force when NATO entered the Kosovo War. Sensor-fused weapons were first fired in combat during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

In 2010 the US government announced the sale to India of 512 CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapons. The expected platform is the SEPECAT Jaguar.

Saudi Arabia has also requested the CBU-105. In May 2015, Human Rights Watch reported on, and criticized, the Saudi use of the CBU-105 SFW during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

The United States last bought SFWs in 2007, after which it continued to be produced for export. In September 2016, Textron announced it would no longer produce the weapon, citing low demand as well as international controversy over the use of cluster munitions.

==Operators==
In addition to the United States, the CBU-105 has been ordered by Singapore, India, Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.

<text>Sundazed Music is an American independent record label founded and based in Coxsackie, New York. It was initially known as a &#x27;60s-centric surf, garage, and psych label. Over time with the additions of imprints such as Modern Harmonic, Americana Anthropology, Beat Rocket, Dot Matrix Recordings, and Liberty Spike Recordings, their reach spans most genres and many decades while still firmly rooted as an archival label. 

==History==
Label founders Bob Irwin and his wife Mary started the label in 1989. Irwin&#x27;s skill at restoring old vinyl records for the (then new) CD format attracted the attention of major labels, who increasingly solicited him to help them re-issue material from their back catalogs. He helped Sony Music release their archival Legacy Records label. Later, his restoration work included early material by the likes of Bob Dylan, Nancy Sinatra, and the Byrds. Irwin also worked at Arista for a time.

The first Sundazed releases were &quot;The Great Lost Knickerbockers Album!&quot; by The Knickerbockers and &quot;Western Union&quot; by the Five Americans, and reflected Irwin&#x27;s personal preference for garage rock and surf music. Later releases included the albums of the Turtles, the Challengers, Liverpool Five, and Jan and Dean&#x27;s long-lost album &quot;Save for a Rainy Day&quot;. The company reissued the complete catalog of LPs by New Orleans funk pioneers the Meters on vinyl and CD. The label later ventured into country music, including extensive reissues of Capitol Records albums by Buck Owens and other acts including Jimmy Bryant. Sundazed also issued vintage jazz guitar albums through their Euphoria label.

==Reissues==
While Sundazed does license many of their releases from labels including Universal Music Group, Sony, and Rhino, they do a large amount of licenses direct with the artists or the artists&#x27; estates.

Additionally, Sundazed Music has purchased catalogs over the years. These catalog purchases include the 1995 purchase of the 1966 Jan And Dean concept album &quot;Save For A Rainy Day&quot; from Dean Torrence, the 1996 purchase of The Golden State Recorders studio masters, the 2000 acquisition of both the Edison International label (home to The Music Emporium and the recordings of Abnak Records, the home to The Five Americans, Bobby Patterson and Jon and Robin. In 2002, they purchased the Best Records, United International, Cedwicke and Wickwire catalogs, including the recordings of The Pyramids and The Daisy Chain. In 2019, they purchased Salem, Oregon-based Garland Records. In 2021, they acquired the exclusive rights to the Shiloh Records (&quot;Safe At Home&quot; by The International Submarine Band, The Kentucky Colonels) catalog. In 2021, they also purchased an extensive tape archive of the Kay Bank Studios to strengthen their partnership with The Trashmen.

In 1995, Sundazed released a 20-track CD by The Pyramids, &quot;Penetration! The Best of the Pyramids&quot;. Bob Irwin worked closely with John Hodge, the manager and producer for the Pyramids. Hodge owned the masters for the original recordings, which included the unissued music. Hodge also had a strong love of the music. Irwin was also planning a second release of their work. It was to be a &quot;Lost Pyramids&quot; album of unreleased material. He also did the same for The Revels, the Impact Records recording artists who had a hit with &quot;Church Key.&quot; Working with The Revels&#x27; original music director Tony Hilder and band members Sam Eddy and Norman Knowles, he had their work which was recorded years before re-released.

They reissued &quot;Oar&quot; by Skip Spence in 1999.

Sundazed reissued the Columbia Moby Grape albums, but were immediately forced to withdraw the first three albums due to legal disputes involving the band&#x27;s ex-manager Matthew Katz. In 2009, they signed Morly Grey to reissue &quot;The Only Truth&quot;, which came out on Sundazed SC 11216. Also that year, they released the long-lost Columbia sessions by the group Love.

On June 24, 2018, it was reported that Sundazed Music would be reissuing Mike Nesmith&#x27;s recordings with First National Band, originally released after The Monkees&#x27; television series was canceled in 1969. The band&#x27;s three albums, &quot;Magnetic South&quot;, &quot;Loose Salute&quot;, and &quot;Nevada Fighter&quot;, were originally recorded and released on RCA Victor between 1970 and 1971 featuring Nesmith on guitar and vocals, with John Ware on drums, John London on bass, and O.J. &quot;Red&quot; Rhodes on pedal steel guitar.

==New releases==
In 2015, after a conversation with former Kentucky Headhunters guitarist Greg Martin about &quot;Groovy Grubworm&quot;, an old instrumental record of which both were fond, Bob Irwin created subsidiary label Sundazed RFD, a label exclusively for instrumental 45 RPM recordings. &quot;Groovy Grubworm&quot; by Harlow Wilcox And The Oakies, &quot;Shark Country&quot; by the SloBeats (a band composed of Kenny Vaughan, Dave Roe and Maxwell Schauf) and &quot;The Lonely Bull&quot; by The East Nashville Teens were among the first records to be released by the new label.

<text>Man In Space Soonest (MISS) was a United States Air Force (USAF) program to put a man into outer space before the Soviet Union. The program was cancelled on August 1, 1958, and was replaced by NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury. Only two men from the program would actually reach outer space. The first, Joseph A. Walker, did so two or three times (depending on the definition of the space border) in X-15 rocket plane tests in 1963. The other, Neil Armstrong, became a NASA astronaut in 1962, flew on Gemini 8 in 1966, and in 1969 on Apollo 11 becoming the first person to walk on the Moon.

== Astronaut candidates ==

MISS would have used a Thor booster, then later an Atlas, to launch a single-man spacecraft into orbit. On June 25, 1958, the Air Force announced the following nine men selected to be astronauts for the program:

* Neil A. Armstrong (1930–2012), 27, NACA. The only member of the group to join the NASA Astronaut Corps. Flew on Gemini 8 and Apollo 11 missions; performed the first docking of two spacecraft, was the first—along with Buzz Aldrin—to land on the Moon, and was the first person to set foot on the Moon.
* William B. Bridgeman (1916–1968), 42, Douglas Aircraft Company
* A. Scott Crossfield (1921–2006), 36, North American Aviation (NAA)
* Iven C. Kincheloe (1928–1958), 29, USAF
* John B. McKay (1922–1975), 35, NACA
* Robert A. Rushworth (1924–1993), 33, USAF
* Joseph A. Walker (1921–1966), 37, NACA. The first member of the group to achieve outer space according to the FAI, and to enter space twice, on two X-15 test flights.
* Alvin S. White (1918–2006), 39, NAA 
* Robert M. White (1924–2010), 33, USAF. The first member of the group to achieve outer space according to the USAF.

<doc id="1288304" wikidata="Q3257129" url="?curid=1288304" title="Lives in the Balance">
<text>Lives in the Balance is the eighth album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1986. It reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The title track as well as &quot;For America&quot; and &quot;In the Shape of a Heart&quot; were released as singles. The album was ranked number 88 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of the best 100 albums of the 1980s. The album reached number 2 in Sweden.

==History==
&quot;Lives in the Balance&quot; was the first album by Browne where overtly political and socially critical songs dominated (three of which were about president Ronald Reagan), although it also included one of his best remembered songs about relationships, the tragic &quot;In the Shape of a Heart&quot;, inspired by his relationship with his first wife. The radio play garnered by &quot;For America&quot; and &quot;In the Shape of a Heart&quot;, and the use of &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot; in the show &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, gained him many new fans who later went back and discovered Browne&#x27;s earlier works.

The lesser commercial success of the album, according to a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; November 1989 article, hardly mattered to Browne: &quot;I like this album as much as any I&#x27;ve ever done,&quot; Browne said. &quot;And there&#x27;s a certain comfort, a security that I have, talking about something that I feel this strongly about. And whether or not an album succeeds wildly or not, that&#x27;s intact.&quot;

The album was certified as a gold record in 1986 by the RIAA.

==Reception==
Critical press focused on the political direction of &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot;. Music critic William Rulhmann wrote retrospectively &quot;...if Browne sounded more involved in his music than he had in some time, the specificity of its approach inevitably limited its appeal and its long-term significance.&quot;

Critic Robert Christgau also commented in a similar vein: &quot;The difference is that Browne shouldn&#x27;t be doing this... he&#x27;s a pop star who&#x27;s stretching his audience and endangering his market share merely by making such a statement in 1986. And he&#x27;s thought hard getting here—not only does his way with words render these lyrics somewhat deeper than Holly Near&#x27;s, but his moralistic put-downs have that edge of righteous anger nobody&#x27;s yet found the formula for.&quot; The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Record Guide wrote that &quot;the title track is a cutting slice of social observation, but the remainder of the album is muddled. For the first time, Browne seems unsure of himself.&quot;

However, the original 1986 Rolling Stone review by Jimmy Guterman praised the album over-all in part because of Browne&#x27;s &quot;new-found ability to link the personal to the political,&quot; which &quot;breathes life&quot; into the songs and &quot;prevents them from becoming too didactic. Browne&#x27;s not just writing about the headlines; he&#x27;s trying to tell the stories of the people they affect.&quot;

<text>Prachuap Khiri Khan (, ) is a town in western Thailand. It is the capital of Prachuap Khiri Khan Province and is on the coast at one of the narrowest stretches in Thailand, only from the border with Myanmar at Dan Sing Khon in the Tenasserim Hills. The area has large pineapple and coconut industries, in addition to being popular with Thai tourists. The town is 291 km south of Bangkok by road.

==History==
Prachuap Khiri Khan is home to a Royal Thai Air Force base, and was an invasion point for Japanese troops on 8 December 1941, during World War II. A commemoration is held each December to honour the 38 Thai airmen and civilians who died in the fighting against the Japanese 143rd Infantry Regiment in the Battle of Prachuap Khiri Khan.

On December 5, 2023, a double-decker bus carrying mostly Thai nationals veered off the road and crashed into a tree, which resulted in 14 deaths and 32 injuries.

==Climate==
Prachuap Khiri Khan has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Seasons are not as distinct as in more northerly parts of Thailand; temperatures are quite similar throughout the year and the dry and wet seasons are not as clearly defined, with appreciable rain falling in all months. However, in general the months from December to April are drier with about in each month, while October and November are the wettest months with over each. The other months, from May to September, have an intermediate level of rainfall around .

==Transportation==

Prachuap Khiri Khan can be reached from Bangkok by train on the Southern Line from Bangkok railway station (Hua Lamphong).

The main road, which runs past the city from north to south, is Route 4 (Phetkasem Road). To the north, this road connects to Phetchaburi, Ratchaburi, Nakhon Pathom and Bangkok; to the south, it connects to Chumphon, Ranong, Phang Nga, Krabi, Trang, Phatthalung and the border with Malaysia near Sadao.

Prachuap Khiri Khan is served by Prachuap Airport, at the south end of town.

==Industry==
Australian company ASC and Thai company Silkline International formed a joint venture to build three Keka-class patrol boats for the Royal Thai Navy at Silkline&#x27;s yard at Pak Nam Pran in Prachuap Khiri Khan.

<text>Rayong (, ) is a city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) on the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand and the capital of Rayong province. It covers tambons Tha Pradu and Pak Nam and parts of &quot;tambons&quot; Choeng Noen and Noen Phra, all within Mueang Rayong district. As of 2016 the population was 64,256 (est.). The main industry is fishing, and it is also the main producer of Thailand&#x27;s fish sauce. It is also the center of the chemical and auto industries. In 2012 Ford Motor Company opened an assembly plant in Rayong to expand Ford&#x27;s presence in the ASEAN area, employing some 2,200 people.

Rayong was named an Asia-Pacific City of the Future by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 2017.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Rayong&quot; comes from the Chong word for &quot;Pterocarpus macrocarpus, (&quot;commonly known as Burma Padauk, and in Thai “Pradu”) a tree that is common in the region. 

==History==
During the late Ayutthaya period, when the former capital of Thailand was being destroyed by the invading Burmese, general Phaya Tak marched his troops to Rayong in order to build up his navy before proceeding on to Chanthaburi. He was later anointed &quot;king&quot; in Rayong. Phaya Tak later became King Taksin of the Kingdom of Thonburi, after which he returned to Ayutthaya, defeated the Burmese and set up a new capital in Thonburi.

Yomjinda Road bisects one of Rayong&#x27;s oldest settlements. The road follows the Rayong River which, in the reign of King Rama VI, was the chief means of transport. The community rehabilitated the old town and today it has become a tourist destination.

<doc id="1288324" wikidata="Q2529738" url="?curid=1288324" title="Vlado Bučkovski">
<text>Vlado Bučkovski (; born 2 December 1962) is a Macedonian politician who served as Prime Minister of Macedonia from 2004 to 2006. He previously served as Minister of Defence from May to November 2001 and from 2002 to 2004. He was president of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia. After the 2006 election defeat by the centre-right VMRO-DPMNE, Radmila Šekerinska took over the party&#x27;s leadership.

On 9 December 2008, Bučkovski was found guilty of abuse of power while serving as defence minister during an armed conflict in 2001 and sentenced to three and a half years in jail.

== Early life ==

Vlado Bučkovski was born on December 2, 1962, in Skopje, Yugoslavia (Macedonia)

Bučkovski graduated from the Faculty of Law in Skopje in 1986, while he took his M.A. degree in 1992 at the Faculty of Law in Skopje. He took his Ph.D. degree at the Faculty of Law in Skopje in 1998, on topic &quot;Roman and Contemporary Law of Obligations&quot;.

== Working and political experience ==

From 1987 to 1988 Bučkovski worked as an expert collaborator in the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, then part of Yugoslavia. In the period from 1988 to 2002 he worked as a lecturer, collaborator, junior assistant and as an assistant at the Faculty of Law in Skopje, while in 2003 he worked as an associate professor at the same faculty.
In the period from 1998 to 2000 Bučkovski was a member of the State Election Commission; while in 2000-2001 he was a Chairman of Skopje City Council. In the period from May 13 until November 26, 2001, he performed the function of a Minister of Defense in the wide coalition Government. From November 1, 2002, until December 2004, Bučkovski again served as Minister of Defense.

Bučkovski became a Chairman of the Government&#x27;s Legal Council on September 15, 2003. He was elected SDSM Leader on November 26, 2004. On the same day, he was assigned a mandate for a composition of a new Government, following the resignation of former Prime Minister Hari Kostov. He served as prime minister until after the 2006 parliamentary elections, in which his party had a disappointing performance and a new government took office.

==Scandal==
Sobranie delegates belonging to parties in Macedonia&#x27;s centre-right ruling coalition voted on August 20, 2007, to strip former premier Bučkovski of his immunity from prosecution. That left him liable to being arrested on charges of involvement in an arms procurement deal costing the country 2.5 million euros (3.18 million U.S. dollars).

Prosecution said he had allegedly benefited from conspiring in 2001 with former Macedonian army chief of staff, General Metodi Stamboliski in buying and selling off spare parts for the army&#x27;s Russian-made T-55 tanks. Stamboliski was arrested in late July 2007, charged with embezzling 1.8 million Euros (about US$2.5 million) and released on bail.

===Conviction===
On December 9, 2008, Bučkovski was found guilty of illegally purchasing excessive quantities of tank parts during the armed conflict in 2001 by Judge Vangelica and sentenced to three and a half years in jail. Former army chief of staff Metodi Stamboliski was jailed for three and a half years, and two defense ministry officials and the manager of a state-owned metal company Aco Gjurcevski, Nelko Menkinovski and Mitre Petkovski were sentenced to 3 years. Bučkovski called the verdict &quot;scandalous&quot; and said that he would appeal. He also said &quot;We have proved that we are innocent and sorry that Macedonia and the court didn&#x27;t use this opportunity to show its independence&quot;.

<doc id="1288327" wikidata="Q17040418" url="?curid=1288327" title="World in Motion (Jackson Browne album)">
<text>World in Motion is the ninth album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1989 (see 1989 in music). It peaked at number 45 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was Browne&#x27;s first album that did not obtain either gold or platinum status. The album took three years to complete and makes statements about nuclear disarmament and the &quot;secret&quot; government that brought forth Oliver North and the Iran-Contra scandal.

==Reception==

The critical reviews of &quot;World in Motion&quot; were lukewarm. Music critic William Rulhmann wrote &quot;Except for the gloomy viewpoint, it was hard to recognize the Jackson Browne of his first few albums amid all the commentary, and even if you agreed with his overall political stance, that was disappointing.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau commented that the best songs were the ones Browne did not write. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s &#x27;I Am a Patriot&#x27; is the only truly memorable song on Browne&#x27;s trilogy of protest albums.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of the title track that &quot;Hackneyed late-’80s production (by Scott Thurston and the artist) and a way too literal political lyric (&#x27;Sun going down on the USA,&#x27; it starts out) make this AOR emphasis track a struggle to sit through, despite the warming presence of Bonnie Raitt.&quot;

<text>Kyle Orlando Massey (born August 28, 1991), also known mononymously as Massey, is an American former actor and rapper. He starred in the Disney Channel sitcoms &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Cory in the House&quot;, in which he played Cory Baxter. In 2005, Massey starred in the Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Life Is Ruff&quot;. He has released several rap songs for Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records. He also provided the voice of Milo in the Disney animated series &quot;Fish Hooks&quot; and was the runner-up on the 11th season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Acting ===
Starting in 2003, Massey played Cory Baxter, the younger brother to Raven-Symoné’s character Raven, in the Disney Channel show &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; for four seasons, and then headlined its 2007 spinoff &quot;Cory in the House&quot;. Massey also starred in the 2005 Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Life Is Ruff&quot;. He later voiced the character of a fish named Milo on the Disney Channel series &quot;Fish Hooks&quot;. Additionally, Massey played PJ Watson in three episodes of the PBS children&#x27;s educational series &quot;The Electric Company&quot;.

=== Music ===
Massey appeared on the &quot;Disney Channel Holiday&quot; soundtrack and the &quot;Shaggy Dog&quot; soundtrack where he performed &quot;Who Let The Dog Out&quot; and &quot;Jingle Bells (a Hip-Hop Carol)&quot;. He rapped in the music video for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Underdog&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Dog&quot; from the &quot;Life is Ruff&quot; soundtrack. Additionally, he performed the theme song for &quot;Cory in the House&quot; and &quot;Yin Yang Yo!&quot;. Massey and his brother Christopher Massey have also performed rap as the duo, The Massey Boyz.

In 2015, Massey opened a SoundCloud account, where he uploaded new original music, with his latest song being &quot;Finess&quot;. On June 12, 2016, Massey was featured using his surname as a mononym on the song &quot;Verse&quot; by Lebanese-American rapper Skate. The collaboration marked Massey&#x27;s first official musical release in nearly a decade.

=== &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; ===
Massey was a contestant on the 11th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, which premiered on September 20, 2010. He and his professional partner Lacey Schwimmer finished as the runners-up in the competition. Massey&#x27;s final dance was a freestyle to the song &quot;Tootsie Roll&quot; by the 69 Boys. He was praised by all the judges, being dubbed the &quot;Fresh Prince of DWTS&quot;.

In 2012, Massey and Schwimmer appeared in the &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; live show in Las Vegas, Nevada.


== Personal life ==
Massey is the younger brother of actor Christopher Massey, who played Michael Barret in the television series &quot;Zoey 101&quot;. Their mother is Angel Massey.

=== Assault by Lil Twist ===
In March 2015, rapper Lil Twist was arrested and charged with several crimes after he and four others assaulted Massey and his brother Christopher. On December 1, 2016, Twist pleaded no contest to six charges and received a one-year jail sentence.

=== 2021 criminal charges ===
On June 29, 2021, Massey was charged in King County, Washington on one count of immoral communication with a minor, where he allegedly sent nude photos to a 13-year-old girl. The criminal charge came after a 2019 lawsuit whose allegations Massey denied, saying that the lawsuit was an extortion attempt, and that in early 2019 the attorneys representing the minor had demanded $1.5 million, threatening to go public with the allegation if he did not comply. The lawsuit also stated that Massey had known the accuser since she was four years old. This criminal charge followed a civil lawsuit filed in March 2019, which sought $1.5 million in damages for similar allegations. The civil case was dropped in December 2019 after the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer withdrew.

<doc id="1288356" wikidata="Q3146398" url="?curid=1288356" title="I'm Alive (Jackson Browne album)">
<text>I&#x27;m Alive is the tenth album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1993 (see 1993 in music). The title track, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, reached  18 on the Album Rock Tracks chart and No. 28 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Other singles released from the album were &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot; (UK No. 67) and &quot;Sky Blue and Black&quot;.

==History==
After veering heavily towards songs of a political nature on his two previous albums, longtime fans of Browne welcomed the return on &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; to his previous style of songwriting.

The song &quot;Too Many Angels&quot; includes backing vocals by Jennifer Warnes, Valerie Carter, Doug Haywood, Katia Cardenal, and Ryan Browne, while the song &quot;All Good Things&quot; includes backing vocals by David Crosby and Don Henley. The song &quot;Sky Blue and Black&quot; was also featured in the pilot episode of American situation comedy &quot;Friends&quot;.

In an interview on &quot;Off Camera&quot; with Sam Jones, Jackson Browne stated that the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; was originally written to be the title song for the James L. Brooks movie of the same name. It was to be a comedic song sung by Albert Brooks where he is begging a test audience to favorably review his latest film.

The album was certified as a gold record in 1995 by the RIAA. A television special aired on the Disney Channel on June 25, 1993, to coincide with this album, entitled &quot;Jackson Browne: Going Home&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; was considered somewhat of a comeback for Browne. Stephen Holden writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; is a striking return to the kind of romantic subject matter that the Los Angeles singer and songwriter seemed to have abandoned after 1980 in favor of political songwriting. His finest album in nearly two decades, it has much in common with his 1974 masterpiece, &quot;Late for the Sky&quot;, whose songs also described the disintegration of a relationship.&quot;

Critic William Ruhlman agreed though did not consider the album as strong. &quot;Longtime fans welcomed the album as a return in style... Browne eschewed the greater philosophical implications of romance and, falling back on stock imagery (angels, rain), failed to achieve an originality of expression. While it was good news that he wasn&#x27;t tilting at windmills anymore, Browne did not make a full comeback with the album, despite a couple of well-constructed songs.&quot; The &quot;Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; wrote Browne &quot;returned to his forte: the personal joy and agony of day-to-day human interaction.&quot;

In the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review for the album from 1993, Kara Manning expressed the belief that &quot;Browne has successfully managed to resurrect his persona of 20 years ago. &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; shudders with the pain of someone who&#x27;s been soundly dumped. And Browne has even gained a sense of gallows humor. Between despondent cries for reconciliation, the singer indulges in refreshingly silly self-deprecation.&quot; However, she wondered, &quot;what does a younger, angrier generation – raging to Dr. Dre and Nirvana – make of all this? But &#x27;70s nostalgia is on a roll...&quot;

The album was in &quot;Q&#x27;s&quot; list of &quot;The 50 Best Albums Of 1993&quot;. It was voted number 456 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<text>Bleed Like Me is the fourth studio album by American rock band Garbage. It was released worldwide on April 11, 2005, through Warner Music imprint A&amp;E Records, with a North American release on Geffen Records the following day. For this album, the band chose a straight rock sound reminiscent of their live performances instead of the electronica that permeated their previous album &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; (2001). The first recording sessions took place in March 2003, but were mostly unproductive due to passive aggression between band members and a general lack of direction. As they struggled to record the album, Garbage quietly split for four months starting in October 2003. They reunited under producer John King in Los Angeles and, following a guest appearance by Dave Grohl on &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot;, they found a renewed focus on production. Garbage recruited drummer Matt Walker and bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen for new recording sessions and completed the album by late 2004.

Following critical praise and high chart positions for its lead single &quot;Why Do You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; had a strong opening week globally, debuting in the top five in eight countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States.

==Background==
Garbage&#x27;s third album &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; had been promoted by a fourteen-month world tour, which culminated in a run of North American shows co-headlined with No Doubt and supported by The Distillers in October and November 2002. Before the tour started, the band spent two weeks at Smart Studios—their recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin—to write new material for their upcoming album. Upon completion of the tour in December 2002, the group took some time off; Shirley Manson returned to her native Scotland, while Butch Vig completed production work on albums by AFI and Jessy Moss. The band regrouped in February 2003 to perform &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; at a MusiCares tribute to U2 frontman Bono. Immediately after the event, they returned to Madison to continue working on their follow-up record.

==Recording and production==

===Initial recording and band breakdown===
On the first day in the studio, Garbage composed a new track, &quot;Right Between the Eyes&quot;, in 30 minutes. Other tracks written during the early sessions were &quot;Hangin&#x27; with the Bitches&quot; and &quot;Never Be Free&quot; (with John 5). Vig said that the quick start made the band feel optimistic and gave the impression that the album would be completed as rapidly as in six months, but &quot;[the album] took a slow spiral downhill&quot;. Recording for the album was halted during the summer when Manson underwent surgery to remove a cyst on her right vocal cord, forcing her to recuperate until August 2003. On September 10, a backhoe careened into the outer walls of Smart Studios, causing extensive damage. Both Garbage and the band Paris, Texas had been working on their albums in the studio. The sessions were permeated by passive-aggressive tensions and an overall lack of artistic focus. According to Vig, &quot;there were a lot of personal arguments and we couldn&#x27;t agree on songs&quot;. Manson suffered writer&#x27;s block and had trouble writing lyrics, and Vig did not like the way the songs sounded. The drummer said that the group frequently argued during production, and that the entire band almost quit. Duke Erikson said that nobody could agree about the music&#x27;s direction, and the band was on the verge of breaking up. He said, &quot;When you lose that common bond of the music, you&#x27;ve got nothing&quot;. Eventually, the group suffered &quot;a complete and utter band meltdown&quot; in October, leading the band members splitting and taking a break from the sessions.

Vig left the studio and returned to Los Angeles. Over the Christmas period, he encountered excited Garbage fans eager to hear about the album&#x27;s progress. Not wanting to disappoint them, he disclosed some song titles to them; after this encounter, he realized that the band still had a future. During the break, Vig met Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters in a party, and casually asked if he would perform drums on a Garbage track, &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot;, as Vig had been frustrated with the song&#x27;s existing drum track.
===Regrouping===
At the beginning of 2004, the band decided to try to salvage the album, taking their management&#x27;s suggestion to work with an external producer for the first time. The musicians also decided that neutral territory would be beneficial, and went to Los Angeles. John King, one half of the production duo Dust Brothers, was enlisted to produce &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot;. Drummer Matt Chamberlain and bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen were hired to perform on the songs. The recordings were completed in King&#x27;s studio The Boat and Sound City in Los Angeles. Towards the end of the recording sessions, Grohl spent a day performing on drums for &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot;. The band said his performance was &quot;raising the bar&quot; for the record, and Vig said that Grohl &quot;brought a different energy level to the song&quot;, which Erikson and Steve Marker tried to follow with their guitar playing. This influenced most of the songs that followed; the musicians wanted the songs to be &quot;scrappy and primal sounding&quot;.

The experience with King, despite only resulting in the completion of one track, &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot;, gave the band perspective and direction. Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other, King could not get much work out of the band, so they realized that they needed to work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously. Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become &quot;burned out on each other&quot;, and that reuniting made them feel able to play &quot;fast and furious—as if our lives depended on it&quot;. Manson overcame her writer&#x27;s block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both &quot;Metal Heart&quot; and &quot;Boys Wanna Fight&quot; referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves. Erikson later said, &quot;It was kind of seductive to think that maybe someone else [would] solve all of our problems, but in the end you gotta do it yourself&quot;.

Feeling that previous album &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; seemed fractured, the band decided to use their live sound; Vig said that he wanted &quot;the pumping energy that all the best raw rock records have&quot;. The band decided that their fourth album would have a straightforward rock sound, instead of a reliance upon electronica and computer interventions. The musicians composed separately at their home studios, sending each other tracks through e-mail and couriers, and the band returned to Wisconsin to finish the album. &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; emerged from a collage of samples and loops, and this time the sound was simpler. Erikson said that rather than production, they depended on the songs. Vig opted to focus on the production duties and leave the drums to guest musicians such as Grohl, whom he considered better at the instrument than him. He also played more guitars on the album, which he found liberating. As a result, drummer Matt Walker also played on several tracks on the album, while Meldal-Johnsen played bass guitar. Most of Manson&#x27;s vocals were recorded at Vig&#x27;s home studio, GrungeIsDead.

On October 18, the band began mixing the album. Some songs were mixed several times; &quot;Sex Is Not the Enemy&quot; was re-recorded three times during the mixing process, &quot;Right Between the Eyes&quot; was recalled from mastering twice, and the band included live strings at the last minute on &quot;Happy Home&quot;. While the project&#x27;s working title was &quot;Hands on a Hard Body&quot;, after the 1997 documentary of the same name, when Manson announced the album&#x27;s release in November 2004, she confirmed that it would be titled &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot;. By December 6, 2004, the album was officially completed. It was mastered in New York City; the initial mastering was completed on December 15, 2004, and the final master was ready for January 6, 2005.

==Composition==
&quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; is a departure from the heavily electronic music of previous albums &quot;Version 2.0&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; in favor of a basic alternative rock sound. Vig said that while the band tried to figure out a new sound for the record, they &quot;went back to getting great sounds from guitars&quot;. The band tried a more spontaneous approach; Manson did most of her singing in the first take and the drums were recorded in a way &quot;that everything was not perfectly balanced—and not so electronic&quot;. The band members tried to translate the energy of the band&#x27;s live performances onto the album; Marker said that the album showed that above all, Garbage is &quot;a loud rock band&quot;. Vig still thought that some of the songs resembled the band&#x27;s earlier material, such as &quot;Metal Heart&quot;, with &quot;a lot of weird electronics that Steve and Duke did, as well as some pretty gnarly guitar.&quot;

The lyrics of &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; talk about relationships and political themes; Manson said, &quot;the last few years ... have been very worrying and you&#x27;d have to be dead to not have some kind of political view at the moment&quot;, and that after many years being insecure about articulating her feelings writing lyrics, she found herself confident that she could express her ideas and sentiment of being &quot;very out of kilter with a lot of the common thoughts of today&quot; in her music. &quot;Boys Wanna Fight&quot; criticizes world affairs and &quot;Sex Is Not the Enemy&quot; is about moral guardians, inspired by the outcry caused by Janet Jackson&#x27;s wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl. The songs about relationships follow Manson&#x27;s tendency to discuss dark topics and emotions; &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; discusses problems with empathy and &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; is about &quot;a predatory female meeting a predatory man&quot;. The album closer &quot;Happy Home&quot; is about conflict within the band and in the wider world during production, the search of forgiveness, peace and coming to terms with one&#x27;s place in a chaotic world.

==Promotion==
===Tour===

Garbage launched the Bleed Like Me World Tour promoting the record on March 29, 2005, with a concert in Paris. The tour visited North America, Europe and Australia, and encompassed headline performances, rock festivals, and television and radio shows. Former Jane&#x27;s Addiction bassist Eric Avery left Alanis Morissette&#x27;s backing band to perform with Garbage for the tour. Matt Walker played drums in the August 22 concert in Chicago because Vig had to depart for his mother&#x27;s funeral. After being initially organized low-key, the tour was moved into large venues when &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; and its lead single &quot;Why Do You Love Me&quot; became surprise hits outside the United States. In September, the band canceled concerts planned for the following month in Europe, and released a press statement saying that the band members had overextended themselves. The tour concluded with a concert in Perth, Australia, on October 1, after six months of concerts.

In 2012, Manson recalled, &quot;The making of this record was very sad for me. Being the only girl in a gang of four can get pretty lonely. We were all struggling to find our chemistry together, and as a result, the experience of making and promoting this was tense and unenjoyable. Ironically, our shows were selling out every night. But after a while, we decided that we needed to go home to lick our wounds.&quot;

===Singles===
The album was preceded by the lead single &quot;Why Do You Love Me&quot;, which peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart—Garbage&#x27;s highest-charting single since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;—while reaching number eight on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States, and becoming the band&#x27;s first single since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Special&quot; to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 97.

The title track was released as the album&#x27;s second single in the US, reaching number 27 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and number six on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. &quot;Sex Is Not the Enemy&quot;, the album&#x27;s second international single and third single overall, peaked at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. The final single, &quot;Run Baby Run&quot;, charted at number 47 in Australia and at number 97 in Germany.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 56, based on 18 reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Tom Sinclair complimented the &quot;humongous hooks&quot;, and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described it as the &quot;most exciting, touching, and most painfully human material they&#x27;ve put out in years&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Fricke commented that &quot;the first two-thirds of &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; is easily the best sustained run of studio Garbage since the opening half of their 1995 debut&quot;, but that the final tracks had &quot;a sameness—a feeling of roaring in circles&quot;. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; praised the new sound and wrote that &quot;a few of the songs (&quot;Run Baby Run&quot; and &quot;Right Between the Eyes&quot; in particular) have all the right ingredients but lack the venom present on the group&#x27;s first two releases&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the album was enjoyable if outdated in its musical approach &quot;as if the band doesn&#x27;t quite know how to do anything else but sound like it&#x27;s the heyday of post-grunge alt-rock.&quot; This opinion was shared by Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Sharon O&#x27;Connell, who wrote that despite the intelligent songs with expertise in &quot;muscly, alt. rock lick or the bubblegum pop hook&quot;, &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; &quot;strikes a depressingly dated note&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin said the album&#x27;s lyrics lacked an emotional punch. He wrote stating that it &quot;approaches a kind of shimmering technical perfection, but remains strangely, stubbornly uninvolving&quot;. Betty Clarke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;while Manson&#x27;s changeling vocals are always worth listening to, Garbage&#x27;s songs often aren&#x27;t.&quot; Philip Robertson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; stated the music sounds manufactured in its too-polished manner, and that &quot;much of what is brought to the fore on this latest musical foray is an earnest attempt at building on the marginal success of their previous power-pop/rock submissions.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 73,000 copies sold in its first week, becoming the band&#x27;s first top-10 album on the chart. It fell to number 24 the following week, selling 32,000 copies. By October 2011, the album had sold 284,000 copies in the United States. &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart, selling 27,375 copies in its first week. The album had sold 84,339 copies in the United Kingdom as of July 2007, and on July 22, 2013, it was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; also charted within the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Mexico, and Sweden.

<text>The Adouma (or Duma) are an ethnic group of Gabon, in central Africa. They primarily live on the South bank of the upper Ogooué River, in the vicinity of Lastoursville (originally an Adouma village), and are known as expert canoeists or the boatmen. They speak Duma, a Nzebi language of the Bantu family.

Their traditions hold that they arrived from the East or Southeast, coming down the Sebe River to the Ogowe, and thence to the Doumé rapids. They made canoes of Aucoumea wood, and sold slaves to the Okandé, receiving European products such as guns and cloth in exchange. The Société du Haut-Ogooué (SHO) established a post at Lastoursville and engaged the Adouma in trade for rubber, ivory, and ebony .

During the 1970s and 1980s, many Adouma moved down the Ogowe, towards Port-Gentil.

<text>Looking East is the eleventh album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1996 (see 1996 in music). It peaked at number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==History==
Coming over two years after his successful &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, Browne returned to more politically and socially oriented themes on &quot;Looking East&quot;. Only two songs are credited to Browne alone as composer, the rest co-credited with his core backing band. The most notable song, &quot;Barricades of Heaven&quot; is a reference to the &quot;&quot; (Spanish for low income housing) of Los Angeles.

Guests include Bonnie Raitt, David Crosby, Vonda Shepard, Ry Cooder, Waddy Wachtel and David Lindley.

==Reception==
&quot;Looking East&quot; was considered something of a letdown after the success of &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; even after reaching the Top 40 of The Billboard 200. Critic William Ruhlman agreed, writing that the album &quot;is a highly referential work from an artist who started where most end and has been earnestly seeking the right direction ever since. &quot;Looking East&quot; finds him in his own backyard, still searching.&quot;

<text>Gigapackets are billions (109) of packets or datagrams. The packet is the fundamental unit of information in computer networks.

Data transfer rates in gigapackets per second are associated with high speed networks, especially fiber optic networks. The bit rates that are used to create gigapackets are in the range of gigabits per second. These rates are seen in network speeds of gigabit Ethernet or 10 Gigabit Ethernet and SONET Optical Carrier rates of OC-48 at 2.5 Gbit/s and OC-192 at 10 Gbit/s.

<doc id="1288485" wikidata="Q7753034" url="?curid=1288485" title="The Naked Ride Home">
<text>The Naked Ride Home is the twelfth album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 2002 (see 2002 in music). It peaked at number 36 on The Billboard 200 chart. The single &quot;The Night Inside Me&quot; reached number 25 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

As of February 2004 the album had sold 139,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen Soundscan.

Guests included Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; and Greg Leisz.

==Reception==

Mark Deming, writing for AllMusic, remarked that &quot;the craft of Browne&#x27;s songwriting is still strong, and his performances are pin-sharp and passionate, but unfortunately the very real strengths of &quot;The Naked Ride Home&quot; only make its flaws all the more glaring – namely, that Browne&#x27;s muse hasn&#x27;t taken him anyplace new and interesting in some time, and even though it&#x27;s clear he still takes the arts of songwriting and recording very seriously, the results lack the depth or the impact of his earlier work.&quot;

James Hunter, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, felt that the album delivered &quot;a varied midtempo dependability that turns richer and more resonant upon re-listenings,&quot; and that it was &quot;looser, warmer and more live-sounding than Browne&#x27;s recent work – yet still as passionately crafted and sung ... he is the sound of unfrantic L.A. cool engaged with the long view.&quot;

<text>Marvel Masterpieces is the name of several subsequent sets of trading cards, printed during 1992-2008, depicting characters and events from Marvel Comics. Featuring large, vividly drawn card fronts and backs detailing trivia, each card showcased a different personality from Marvel&#x27;s body of work.

There was also a set of pop-up cards, distributed in sets of six with the Marvel Activity Sets. They measured about .

==Series 1 - 1992==
The first set, which came out in 1992, consisted entirely of portraits painted by Joe Jusko and was published by Skybox. The set included 100 standard cards, and 5 &quot;Battle&quot; Spectra Cards. There was a factory-tin set of the cards which also contained 5 &quot;Lost Marvel&quot; cards that could only be found in those tins. There were 6 promo cards and 3 pre-production prototype cards too, which were only available to dealers and/or available as free with &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine (#13 Psylocke) and comics books (Marvel Age #118 Hulk) etc.

The artwork from series 1 was also released by Marvel as 4 collections printed at standard comic size, titled &quot;The Marvel Masterpieces Collection (1-4)&quot; allowing it to be seen in greater detail.

The production run of sealed boxes is 350,000 according to the gold-colored stickers (within the factory applied cellophane wrapper) used to indicate that a box is factory sealed.
The production run of tins (containing the &quot;Lost Marvel&quot; cards) is 35,000 according to the gold-colored sticker found on the bottom of the tin, within the factory cellophane seal.

==Series 3 - 1994==
This set was drawn entirely by Greg and Tim Hildebrandt. It contained two subsets: 10 Holofoils which came in silver, gold and bronze variations, depending on where they were purchased, and 9 PowerBlast cards. This set was also the first to introduce &quot;parallel sets&quot; to the series. All 140 base cards came with a parallel gold-foil &quot;Signature&quot; card which came one-to-a-pack. This concept was also used in other Marvel card sets. One exception: there are Jumbo and Walmart retail store boxes of the Hildebrandt 1994 set, and those have Gold and Bronze versions, respectively, of the usually silver Holofoil cards. Sealed boxes of those non-hobby or standard retail kind, especially the Walmart retail store ones with the bronze foil versions, are quite valuable. Walmart boxes have been known to sell for thousands of dollars on Ebay, Amazon and other various websites.

==Series 4 - 1995==
This set consisted of 150 standard cards, 22 &quot;Canvas&quot; cards, 8 &quot;Holoflash&quot; cards, and 2 &quot;Mirage&quot; cards. Artwork for the set was done by four artists: Dave Devries, Dimitrios Patelis, Peter Scanlan and Nelson. Each artist painted 38 different characters that the other artists also painted plus 9 unique characters that were only painted once. Continuing from the previous set, these cards came with parallel cards this time in the form of &quot;E-Motion&quot; signatures. The two mirage cards are rare, coming one to every 360 packs depending on the ratio. They are highly sought-after. These boxes have increased highly in value and are very much sought by collectors as the 1996 Marvel masterpieces boxes. Since both years have limited print run the 1995 and 1996 are by far the rarest of the Marvel boxes to date. It was unknown at the time of production but now to a list count average found and credited.

==Series 6 - Oct 2007 ==
A new series bearing the name &quot;Marvel Masterpieces&quot; was released by Upper Deck (UDE) in October 2007. Most (if not all) of the art used for the trading cards is taken from artwork which UDE already owns and has used in its Vs. System TCG.

This set consists of 90 base cards, 9 Spider-Man subset inserts, 9 X-Men subset inserts, 3-artist splash page subsets (triptychs) featuring Art by Alex Ross, Arthur Adams, and Drew Struzan.

Each base card in the set has two parallel versions: a &quot;holo-foil&quot; version, and a gold-foil border version. Each of the Spider-Man and X-Men subsets has a holo-foil subset version.

Additionally, there are randomly inserted &quot;Artist Sketch Cards&quot; each featuring an original sketch by a noted artist. These are all one-of-a-kind. It is not known exactly how many sketch cards were put into circulation, but there should be roughly the same number as the boxes, 13,000, since the odds on finding one is approximately 1:36 packs, or 1 per box.

Also, the art from the Alex Ross splash subset was made into ashcan box-toppers (black-and-white versions) and inserted randomly 1 per box, not in a pack. Plus, the artwork from the Art Adams splash subset was made into ashcan case-toppers, one included per factory case.

Each Hobby pack (packs bought from hobby/comic shops) contains a card with a code for 100 UDE points which can be redeemed at www.udepoints.com and then spent on various items in the ude points store.

==Series 7 - July 2008==
After the successful re-launch of the Marvel Masterpieces set in 2007, Upper Deck decided to release another set. The second set, Marvel Masterpieces 2 came out in July 2008. This set consisted of a 90-card base set, 9 Marvel Heroines Chase Set, 9 Avengers Chase Set, 5 Fantastic Four Movie Memorabilia Chase Set, and 3 Hulk Chase Cards and 3 Iron Man Chase Cards. Also available one per box was a hand-drawn sketch card drawn by an artist. There were more sketch cards with this set than the 2007 set because this saw a release of 18,000 boxes as opposed to 13,000 in 2007. Upper Deck plans on releasing Marvel Masterpieces 3 on December 9, 2008.

3 Hulk Chase Cards and 3 Iron Man Chase Cards
Sealed hobby boxes contain chase cards &quot;Hulk A&quot; and &quot;Iron Man A&quot; (1:18 packs)
Target packs contain chase cards &quot;Hulk B&quot; and &quot;Iron Man B&quot;

<text>Repeaters is a 2010 Canadian thriller film directed by Carl Bessai, written by Arne Olsen, and starring Dustin Milligan, Amanda Crew, and Richard de Klerk as young drug addicts who find themselves stuck in a time loop.

==Plot==
Kyle, Sonia, and Michael are inmates at a rehabilitation facility. Bob, the administrator, tasks them with apologizing to those they have hurt with their addiction. When Kyle attempts to apologize to his teenage sister Charlotte, she angrily blows him off, and the principal kicks him off school grounds. Sonia goes to the hospital where her dying father is a patient, but she is unable to bring herself to face him. Michael visits his father in jail, but the conversation is cut short by his father&#x27;s abusive threats. When Bob asks them to discuss their day in group therapy, they refuse, and Michael storms off. While discussing the pointlessness of Bob&#x27;s therapy, Sonia learns that her father has died. As the trio tries to deal with their emotional pain, a storm rolls in, and each of them is shocked and knocked unconscious.

When they wake up in the morning, they find that it is the same day, and all the same events repeat. Kyle, Sonia, and Michael stumble through the day and repeat their actions in a daze. When they discuss the situation, Michael is intrigued by the consequence-free possibilities open to them, but Kyle convinces them to act on a news report that he recalls. They go to a dam but are too late to stop a jumper. Michael suggests that they take advantage of the situation, and they commit petty crimes that result in a stay in jail. Eventually, as the day repeats endlessly, they embark on a drug bender and crime spree, robbing a store and culminating in the violent kidnapping of Tiko, a drug dealer who has been selling to Charlotte and her friend Michelle. On another loop, Michael forces Kyle to slice Tiko’s throat. At the dam, Michael carelessly risks his life walking on top of the railing and dares Sonia to do the same. When she slips, Michael merely laughs and refuses to try to help Kyle save her. Sonia falls to her death, then wakes up with a gasp on the next repeat. Sonia claims to remember nothing of her death, and the trio become emboldened by their apparent immortality.

On one repeat, Kyle and Sonia save the jumper at the dam, then discover that Michael has raped Michelle. When Kyle and Sonia confront Michael, Michael accuses them of hypocrisy and says that all their bad actions are excusable because everything gets reset. Michael&#x27;s behavior becomes more violent and antisocial as the days repeat. Shaken by Michael&#x27;s behavior, Kyle ambushes him in the morning and ties him to a chair. Kyle and Sonia fall in love and work toward redemption, but Michael laughs at Kyle; he claims that Sonia&#x27;s story of childhood sexual abuse is just an act, quoting a story he says she uses to seduce men.

Kyle and Sonia form a deeper relationship during the loops and make peace with their families. This causes the time loop to abruptly end, but they do not realize it until the next day in the middle of a violent rampage by Michael that ends with the senseless murders of two people. Freaked out, Michael takes Charlotte hostage, but he commits suicide after Kyle attempts to reason with him. Michael is surprised to wake up again, stuck in his own time loop, unsure if he can arrange peace with his own family to break the loop.

==Cast==

==Production==
Shooting took place in Mission, British Columbia on January 11 to 31, 2010.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was released on DVD August 9, 2011.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 20% of five surveyed critics gave it a positive review; the average rating was 4.2/10. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a dead-serious version of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;&quot; that &quot;brings little personal energy&quot;. Scott A. Gray of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that the film is not as preachy as expected, but it is still not the promised mindbender of the tagline. Joel Harley of &quot;Starburst&quot; rated it 8/10 stars and wrote that it is a cynical take on &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, neither original nor too derivative to be enjoyed. Chris Knight of the &quot;National Post&quot; called it a complicated, intelligent, and elegant version of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; that introduces more variables and selfish characters. Bruce DeMara of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; rated it 3.5/4 stars and described it as &quot;&quot;Groundhog Day&quot; but without the laughs and with a wild, cerebral spin.&quot; Kate Taylor of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; rated it 2.5/4 stars and called it &quot;a small but interesting thriller&quot; that &quot;does not do full psychological justice to its clever premise&quot;.

<text>William Ivens (June 28, 1878 – June 20, 1957) was a religious and political figure in Manitoba, Canada. He was a leading figure in the Winnipeg General Strike, and subsequently served as a Labour member of the Manitoba legislature from 1920 to 1936.

== Early life ==
William Ivens was born in 1878 at Barford, in Warwickshire, England, to William Henry Ivens and Sarah Willis. He was the second eldest of seven siblings and was from a family who were actively involved in the local community.

William emigrated to Canada in 1896 and initially found work as a farm labourer and gardener in rural Manitoba. He was educated at Wesley College, Winnipeg and was greatly influenced by Reverend Salem Bland. He wrote for the school newspaper Vox Wesleyana and a poem published in a 1906 edition demonstrates his early and emerging political views. Titled ‘the Three Voices’, it was concerned with unproductive, hedonistic and materialistic lifestyles. William graduated from Wesley College in 1906 with a Bachelor of Arts, then in 1907 with a Bachelor of Divinity.

He then attended the University of Manitoba in 1909, gaining a Master of Arts degree in political economy with his thesis on the topic of Canadian Immigration.

In the summer holidays between his academic years he travelled to the Little Grand Rapids settlement on the shore of Lake Winnipeg and worked as a missionary.

On July 7, 1908, William Ivens and Louisa Davis wed. On 27 January 1910, their first son Milton Herbert Ivens was born. A daughter Eva Maude Ivens was born on 4 July 1913 at Pipestone, Manitoba and died a few months later on 18 September 1913. Another son John Boyden Ivens was born in 1915 at Brandon, Manitoba and died in 1921. Their last child Lewis William Ivens was born in 1918 and died in 1920.

== Career ==

=== Ministerial career ===
Ivens began his ministerial career at a time when the social gospel was on the rise in Canada. From 1908 to 1916 William served as a minister at several rural posts in Manitoba, at Selkirk, Makinak, Ochre River, Pipestone and Brandon. He continued writing throughout this period, for example, in 1912 he submitted a letter to Winnipeg&#x27;s labour paper, the Voice, titled ‘The Prince of Peace, a Protest against Militarism and Barbarism’ which outlined his objections to military spending in the 1911 naval budget. He also wrote for the paper in 1916 about the concept of the Parliament of Man and in 1917 about Balkan nationalism.

William was stationed at the McDougall Methodist Church in Winnipeg in 1916, and called for the church to lead the labour movement in its struggle against the prevailing tendencies of North American capitalism. In 1917 and 1918, Ivens was opposed by several members of his congregation by defending conscientious objectors to World War I and criticizing the management of the war. He expressed these opinions as a private citizen in newspaper articles, rather than from his pulpit; nevertheless, many church members opposed him as insufficiently patriotic in wartime.

Although there were several petitions presented in Ivens&#x27; favour (he had improved the financial status of McDougall during his time as its minister), the overseeing body removed him from the church in June 1918 in an effort to restore local unity. Ivens agreed to stand down on condition that he be granted a year&#x27;s leave to establish a &quot;workers&#x27; church&quot;. Before the end of the month, he had founded the first Labour Church in the City of Winnipeg.

=== Labour Church Leader ===
June 30, 1918 marked the start of the Labour church as soon to be members gathered at the Winnipeg Labor Temple to discuss the possibility of a church for workers, pro-labour progressives and disgruntled church members. This church was created to preach information relevant to the working class. The Labour church held meetings on Sunday evenings and rapidly grew in popularity, attracting over 4,000 mostly working class parishioners in just six months. In January 1919, the Church opened the pulpit to women.

Ivens was directly involved in labour activism during this period. He was employed as an organiser for the Dominion Labour Party, and attempted to build local networks of support in a speaking tour of western Canada. Upon his return to Winnipeg, he assumed the editorship of the &quot;Western Labour News&quot;, a newspaper published by the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council.

==== Participation in the Winnipeg General Strike ====
In May 1919 the Western Labour News reported that a general strike in Winnipeg seemed ‘inevitable’ as there was widespread anger about the working and living conditions endured by inhabitants of the city. When the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 was called, Ivens continued as editor of the Western Labour News and published a Daily Strike Bulletin to provide information to striking workers. He wrote numerous articles in support of the strikers.

The Citizens’ Committee of One Thousand also created their own paper during the strike, the Winnipeg Citizen, advertising itself as being printed to keep the inhabitants who weren&#x27;t involved in the Strike informed. It printed articles which referred to William and four other key figures of the labour movement as ‘the red five’ or ‘anarchists.’ William himself wrote that the Winnipeg Citizen published ‘vile and pernicious propaganda’ and joked that they thought he was a Russian spy called ‘Ivens the Terrible.’

Reverend Ivens preached services of his church for the six weeks of the strike with an estimated 171 sermons. Within these services strike news would be relayed along with the prayers. Although he warned against public disorder, he also referred to the strike as the harbinger of a new age for the working-class in Canada. He preached that change should come from the peaceful withdrawal of labour, protest and at the ballot box. His Labour Church soon became the scene of extremely large meetings, with crowds almost doubling to 7,000 listeners.

During the strike, William was also an active in committees organising food supplies and in issuing cards to workers who were unable to go on strike due to providing essential services (such as delivering bread and milk to families with young children). 

When the Canadian government suppressed the strike in June 1919, Ivens was arrested on charges of seditious libel and conspiracy at 2am during an overnight raid on the 17th of June. Other leaders were arrested alongside William, with most of the key figures of the strike committee imprisoned. The day after William&#x27;s arrest, his devastated wife Louisa addressed crowds of striking workers at the Labour Temple. James Shaver Woodsworth, another Methodist minister and labour activist, took over Iven&#x27;s positions following the arrest.

There were numerous protests against the arrests William and the other strike leaders, and crowds gathered to hear William preach from behind bars on Sundays. To calm the public mood and reduce gatherings, William and the other imprisoned strike leaders were transferred to Birch River prison farm, until they would come to trial. This prison was 75 miles away from Winnipeg and could only be accessed by train.

William made a four-hour address to the jury at his trial and used the occasion to publicise and justify his views. Although it is unlikely that his editorials constituted sedition by the standards of the age, on 28 March 1920, he was found guilty and given a year in prison. He was also charged with contempt of court for comments he had made about the trial of the Metal Workers Union president Robert Boyd Russell, who was found guilty of ‘seditious conspiracy’ in 1919. William is reported to have said that: ‘In the sight of the judge and jury Russell was condemned as a guilty man, but in the sight of Almighty God he is innocent.’

Ivens was sent to Stony Mountain Penitentiary.

=== Political career ===
While still in prison, Ivens ran as a candidate of the Dominion Labour Party (DLP) in the provincial election of 1920, and was successfully elected in the city of Winnipeg. Winnipeg, at the time, elected ten members by preferential balloting; Ivens finished fifth on the first count and was declared elected on the second after receiving transfers from DLP leader Fred Dixon.

William was released on bail from prison on 29 February 1921, to cheering crowds of supporters, and by 4 March 1921 he was already in the Legislature taking part in debates. In 1926 he argued against capital punishment and in 1928 he supported a bill to introduce old age pensions.

In late 1920, the DLP split into two factions via a fallout over the Winnipeg General Strike. Dixon, Ivens, Woodsworth and most others on the left of the DLP founded the new Independent Labour Party of Manitoba (ILP) in November 1920. William was re-elected in the provincial election of 1922, but was reduced to fourth place among the successful social democratic candidates and was not assured of re-election until the final count.

Ivens was re-elected in the elections of 1927 and 1932, though again behind other successful social democratic candidates. He lost his seat in the provincial election of 1936. In 1940, Ivens ran unsuccessfully as an Ontario Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) candidate in the federal Kenora—Rainy River riding. He attempted a comeback in the election of 1941 as a candidate of the Manitoba Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, but was unsuccessful. Ivens remained active in the CCF after leaving the legislature but never held a seat.

By the late 1920s, attendance at the Canadian Labour Churches has dwindled significantly and it was eventually superseded by a weekly Labour forum. William was a frequent guest speaker there. He published numerous pamphlets in the 1930s and 1940s on a wide variety of topics from the dangers of European fascism to concerns about local working conditions.

In addition to his political and religious careers, Ivens also received a chiropractor&#x27;s certificate from the Manitoba School of Chiropractic in 1925 and practiced in the field. He contributed numerous articles to &quot;The Chiropractor&quot; journal over the years, covering health, social and political topics. William&#x27;s son Milton Henry Ivens also entered the medical profession as he emigrated to the United States and qualified as a physician.

== Death and legacy ==
He died on June 20, 1957 at the home of his son Dr Milton Henry Ivens in Chula Vista, California, at the age of 78. His body was repatriated to Canada and he was interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Winnipeg, on 12 July 1957.

Ivens worked to create a better life for the working class of Manitoba. He preached within his Labour Church, supported strikers and worked as a politician to make change.

<doc id="1288593" wikidata="Q7892398" url="?curid=1288593" title="United States copyright law in the performing arts">
<text>As with any other idea, the idea for a performing arts production is copyrighted as soon as it is created. In order for any of these works to be performed, the proper licenses must be obtained. The only exception to this rule is with the case of works already in the public domain. This includes, for example, the works of William Shakespeare. Whether a work is in the public domain or not depends on the date it was created. If the work is not in the public domain, a license must be obtained to perform it. In many cases, the license for a Broadway production is called an option.

==Options==
For a producer to put on a Broadway production, he or she must acquire an option, which involves paying a fee. The option is to make sure that the producer is serious about producing this show, and puts the money forth to prove it. For a typical Broadway play, a producer pays $5,000, therefore getting the rights for the first six months. He or she can then pay $2,500 to renew the option for the next six months, and then $5,500 for anywhere up to twelve months after. Sometimes the third renewal requires that the producer has a director, star, or theatre attached to the production. This is all to make sure that the producer is serious about producing this play or musical.

Usually, a Broadway production option gives the producer first-class rights. This typically means a production in New York and possibly London. It can also include a first-class touring production. Other rights, such as rights to perform the work in other places around the world, are not included in first-class rights. It is also possible to get commercial use rights, which would give the producer rights to cast albums and merchandise that comes from the production. Subsidiary rights can also be negotiated. If a producer holds part of an author&#x27;s subsidiary rights, this would mean the producer would have a share in the profits from all amateur productions, television versions, or movie versions of this production. These rights typically only last for a certain period of time that is negotiated.

The rights must be obtained for all parts a production. For example, for a musical, the rights must be obtained for the book, lyrics, and music.

A producer can also hire a writer to create a work. This could be defined as a Work for hire. If the work is a work for hire, the copyright of the material would be given to the producer of the show, not the writer. Whether or not a work is a work for hire is defined in the contract.

In many cases, the rights to any or all of these parts of a musical or play are distributed by various companies that monitor and represent the rights of the artists. Instead of dealing with the artist directly, these companies monitor the artists&#x27; rights.

==Obtaining rights==
There are a few companies that represent artists and their copyrights. These companies make sure that the original artist gets credit and payment for the use of his or her work. Here are a few examples:

ASCAP is the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. They represent composers, songwriters, and lyricists.
BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.) also represent songwriters and composers.
The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization represent the authors and rights holders of many theatrical productions.

Some of these companies do not license dramatic performances of works, and some do. A dramatic performance of a work can be anywhere from a performance of an entire dramatic work, such as a musical, or a concert of a few of an artist&#x27;s songs. ASCAP does not license dramatic performances, but The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization does. An example of a non-dramatic work would be if a song from a musical were to be played on the radio.

==Artist copyright==
If the production is not a work for hire, many of the artists involved have copyrights once the production is complete. For example, the choreographer&#x27;s work is copyrighted. According to the U.S. Copyright Office, in order for choreography to be protected under copyright, it needs to be &quot;fixed in a tangible medium of expression from which the work can be performed.&quot; In a typical musical, this would make the choreographer&#x27;s work copyrighted. This means that his or her copyrighted dance routine cannot be used again without his or her permission and payment.

While actors do not have copyright over the words they say or the moves they do, they do have the right to prohibit the recording or broadcasting of their performances. They also have the right to have their name associated with the part they played.

There is some controversy over whether or not a director has copyright over his or her directorial services in a play or musical. There has been no official decision on this matter.

==Recent copyright issues==
When obtaining rights to a play or musical, it is also a good idea to make sure the chain of title is intact. This means if the musical or play is based on a book, it is important that the rights to the book have been acquired before the musical or play can be produced on Broadway or in London.

In 2010, this became a problem in the Broadway production of the musical &quot;Fela!&quot;. Carlos Moore is said to be the only official biographer of Fela Anikulapo Kuti. The musical, first produced Off-Broadway, then on Broadway, and then in London, details Fela&#x27;s life using many of his songs. Carlos Moore claimed that the producers of the musical used his biography but did not credit him or give him any compensation for the use of his copyrighted work. He filed a $5 million suit for his belief of infringement.

The producers of the production said that Carlos Moore knew about the show when it was Off-Broadway, and even participated in interviews about the show. They therefore did not understand his lawsuit years after he became knowledgeable about the show.

<text>Jean-Rémy Bessieux (24 December 1803 – 30 April 1876), also seen as Jean-Rémi or Jean René, was the founder of the Roman Catholic mission in Gabon and the first bishop to serve there.

Born in Vélieux in Montpellier, France, Bessieux had been a parish priest and seminary teacher when he entered the Holy Heart of Mary Congregation in August 1842. (The group had been founded to evangelize the black races, and would merge with the Holy Ghost Fathers in 1848.)

Travelling with Brother Grégoire Say, Bessieux arrived in Gabon September 1844, and settled at Okolo, a village in the Agekaza-Quaben clan&#x27;s area, not far from the French fort. Bessieux learned Mpongwe, and published a grammar of it in 1847. He also established a school for boys, a church, and arranged the 1849 arrival of the Immaculate Conception Sisters of Castres.

Elevated to bishop in December 1848, his efforts in the 1850s to establish additional outposts in the Gabon Estuary were not successful. Even so, he continued in Gabon until his death in 1876, sometimes without official support, and with only occasional brief visits to Europe to recover his health. Gardinier observes that Bessieux&#x27;s determination to stay in Gabon probably influenced the French government&#x27;s decision to maintain their base.

Bessieux was remembered on the 100th anniversary of his death by a postage stamp of Gabon.

<text>Roderick F. Gardner (born October 26, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for six seasons. He played college football for the Clemson Tigers.

==College career==
Gardner played college football at Clemson University, where he started as a quarterback and safety on the practice squad (as a true freshman) before switching to wide receiver his sophomore year. He was selected as a second team All-ACC during his junior year after setting the school record for catches, yards, and receptions per game. His senior year, he not only made first team All-ACC, but was a first team All-American as well. In 2000, he was one of the ten finalists for the Biletnikoff Award after posting six touchdowns on 51 receptions and 956 yards.

==Professional career==
===Washington Redskins===
Gardner was chosen by the Washington Redskins with the 15th overall selection in the first-round draft pick of the 2001 NFL draft. During his rookie year, he was selected as NFC Offensive Player of the Week after a 208-yard, one touchdown performance against the Carolina Panthers. His history at quarterback would lead the Redskins to utilize him on trick plays during games; during the 2003 NFL season he was 2-for-3 for 46 yards and two passing touchdowns (to Chad Morton and Trung Canidate).

===Carolina Panthers===
After four seasons in Washington, he was traded to the Carolina Panthers during the 2005 offseason for a sixth-round pick in the 2006 NFL draft. He spent most of the season fourth on the Panthers&#x27; depth chart, behind Steve Smith, Keary Colbert, and Ricky Proehl.

===Green Bay Packers===
Gardner was waived by the Panthers on December 16, 2005, and he was then signed by the Green Bay Packers on December 19, 2005. He re-signed with Green Bay on March 21, 2006. On September 2, 2006, Gardner was waived by the Packers.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
In September 2006, he signed a three-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. In 2006 with the Chiefs, he only had 2 receptions for 17 yards. He was released before the 2007 season.

===NFL statistics===
==Personal life==
Gardner competed on the thirty-sixth season of the American reality competition show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; with his wife Leticia, finishing in third place.

<text>. She is a Japanese actress turned activist for the legalization of cannabis in Japan.

==Biography==
Saya Takagi started smoking cannabis when she was 17. In 1994, she became famous with her the role of &quot;Kashiwagi Reiko&quot; in the Japanese drama film &quot;Okane ga Nai&quot;.

In 2012, after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Saya Takagi decided to abandon the world of entertainment to become more involved in environmental activism, and adopted a self-sufficient lifestyle.

In 2016, Saya Takagi, then manager for the Cannabis Inspection Committee, ran for an Upper House seat with the New Renaissance Party, with medical cannabis as one of her platforms.

In October 2016, she was arrested at her guesthouse in Okinawa for possession of 55 grammes (2 oz) of cannabis, and in April 2017 was sentenced to a one-year suspended prison sentence, after having spent six months in jail.

<text>Thaw is the period when the snow and ice melt, at the end of the winter, in cold climates.

== January thaw ==
January thaw is a term applied to a or rise in temperature in mid-winter found in mid-latitude North America.

Sinusoidal estimates of expected temperatures, for northern locales, usually place the lowest temperatures around January 23 and the highest around July 24, and provide fairly accurate estimates of temperature expectations. Actual average temperatures in North America usually significantly differ twice over the course of the year

* Mid-autumn temperatures tend to be warmer than predicted by the sinusoidal model, creating the impression of extended summer warmth known as Indian summer. 
* For five days around January 25, temperatures are usually significantly warmer than predicted by the sinusoidal estimate, and also warmer than neighboring temperatures on both sides. 

During this &quot;thaw&quot; period, usually lasting for about a week, temperatures are generally about 6 °C (10 °F) above normal. This varies from year to year, and temperatures fluctuate enough that such a rise in late-January temperature would be unremarkable; what is remarkable (and unexplained) is the tendency for such rises to occur more commonly in late January than in mid-January or early February, which sinusoidal estimates have to be slightly warmer.

In some regions (such as northern Canada) this phenomenon will not be manifest as a &quot;thaw&quot; in the technical sense, since temperatures will remain below freezing.

The January thaw is believed to be a weather singularity. A possible physical mechanism for such phenomena was offered in the 1950s by E.G. Bowen: he suggested that some &quot;calendaricities&quot; (as he called them) might be explicable in terms of meteoric particles from cometary orbits acting as ice nuclei in terrestrial clouds; his theory then received some support from several sources. However, Bowen&#x27;s ideas later fell out of favour with the development of atmospheric dynamic modelling techniques, although one of his rainfall peaks does seem to correspond with the date of the January thaw.

Data analysis has not found statistically significant support for the supposed January thaw. The authors of this study state that &quot;the effects of sampling in finite climate records are wholly adequate to account for the existence of January thaw &#x27;features&#x27; in northeastern U.S. temperature data.&quot;

<doc id="1288669" wikidata="Q2289354" url="?curid=1288669" title="Singularity (climate)">
<text>In meteorology, a singularity is a weather phenomenon likely to occur with reasonable regularity around a specific approximate calendar date, outside of more general seasonal weather patterns (e.g., that May Day is usually warmer than New Year&#x27;s Day in northern locales). The existence of singularities is disputed, some considering them due to seeing patterns in noise and statistical artifacts from small samples.

In North America, the most significant purported singularities are January thaw (warmer weather around January 25) and Indian summer (warmer weather in mid-autumn).

More fanciful ones include the British tradition that rain on St. Swithun&#x27;s Day (15 July) will be followed by forty days and nights of rain, and similar folk beliefs around Groundhog Day.

==Studies==
Although folk tales such as St Swithun&#x27;s Day generally have little credibility, some of these events have a more solid basis. Early scientific investigation involved the creation of calendars of singularities based on temperature and rainfall anomalies. Later and more successful work by Hubert Lamb of the Climatic Research Unit was based on air circulation patterns. Lamb&#x27;s work analysed daily frequency of airflow categories between 1898 and 1947. Similar work was carried out by Flohn and Hess in central Europe based on analysis of air flows from 1881 to 1947.

A 1955 study by Liverpool Observatory and Tidal Institute analysed maximum daily temperatures at a single location from 1900 to 1953. This found problems when attempting to demonstrate the statistical significance of apparent temperature anomalies.

In the 1950s, E.G. Bowen suggested that some rainfall calendaricities might be explicable in terms of meteoric particles from cometary orbits acting as ice nuclei in terrestrial clouds; his theory received support from a number of sources. However, such work has now fallen out of favour due to modern dynamic modelling techniques, although articles are still being written reflecting an interest in the topic.

<doc id="1288744" wikidata="Q4949942" url="?curid=1288744" title="Boundary Field">
<text>Boundary Field, also known as American League Park II and National Park, is a former baseball ground in Washington, D.C. located on the site currently occupied by Howard University Hospital; bounded approximately by Georgia Avenue, 5th Street, W Street and Florida Avenue, NW. It was just outside what was then the city limit of Washington, whose northern boundary was Boundary Street which was renamed Florida Avenue in 1890.

==History==
===The First Team===
The ground was home to the Washington Senators of the American Association in 1891 and then of the National League from 1892 to 1899 after the League absorbed the Association. The National League contracted after the 1899 season and the Senators folded. From 1891 to 1893, the field was also the venue for home games of the Georgetown football program.

===The Second Team===
The field was also the home of the American League&#x27;s Washington Senators (also known as the Nationals) from 1904 through 1910. When the American League declared itself a major league in 1901 and began raiding National League rosters for talent, the NL decided to retain its lease on the Boundary Field property. This forced the American League&#x27;s new reincarnation of the Senators to find an alternative home field, and they settled upon a field in Northeast DC with the prosaic name American League Park.

After peace was made between the two leagues in 1903, the Senators moved to the old Boundary Field location, which was subsequently also referred to as American League Park. (Today, the terms &quot;American League Park I&quot; and &quot;American League Park II&quot; are used to make the distinction). When the Senators were rebranded as the Nationals, the park was also referred to as National Park. The Senators/Nationals played there through the 1910 season. In 1909, the annual Congressional Baseball Game was begun, and was held at this venue and its successor for the next several decades.

On April 14, 1910, one of baseball&#x27;s great traditions was born at National Park when President William Howard Taft threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The game involved the Washington Senators against the Philadelphia Athletics which the Senators won 3–0. The Senators&#x27; Manager, Jimmy McAleer came up with the idea and catcher Gabby Street was selected to catch the ball instead of star pitcher Walter Johnson after he declined the offer. however, at the last minute, President Taft threw it to Walter Johnson.

===The Fire===
The wooden stands were destroyed by fire on March 17, 1911. Around 11:30 in the morning, the fire started and spread rapidly due to a southwestern wind, threatening to destroy the nearby lumber yard owned by the Eisinger Brothers on 7th and W Street NW. It was detected when a bicycle police officer, T. F. Sweeney of the 8th precinct, James P. O&#x27;Dea, superintendent of the park and another man noticed a small curl of smoke coming from under the bleachers as they were standing at the main entrance. The police officer ran to the police telephone box located at 7th Street and Florida Ave NW. No. 7 Engine Company responded to the call while the superintendent attempted to put out the fire by hand, burning himself to the wrist. Upon arrival, it was determined that the fire was beyond the control of a single engine and reinforcement was called from another local police box.

The Fire Deputy Chief, G. J. Sullivan arrived at the scene in the chief&#x27;s automobile. The nearby lumber yard had suffered significant damage in two previous fires, with the latest only four years prior and damaging the clubhouse and grandstand. Based on those facts and the height of the flames in the air, a general alarm was called. Two lines of hoses were laid through the main entrance but the fire spread in the opposite direction, sweeping around the north side of the grandstand. It reached the outfield bleachers and soon after, the old storehouses in the Freedman&#x27;s Hospital and used by the lumber yard, causing $25,000 worth of damage. The Fire Department focused on saving the open bleachers on the south field and the main portion of the lumber yard by keeping the piles of lumber wet.

The Fire Chief, Frank J. Wagner, was on a business trip to New York City. He was on his way back to Washington, D.C., when the fire started. His train happened to pass in through the Eckington Yards only a few blocks from the fire and he could see the smoke and flames. He got in a car at Washington Union Station to arrive in time to take charge after his deputy had announced the fire was under control. The fire had attracted large crowds causing 7th, U and 9th Streets NW to be shut down to traffic. The reserves of almost every police precinct needed to be called in to contain the crowds.

===Aftermath===
The baseball field suffered $18,000 worth of damage in the half hour fire. The clubhouse in the northeast corner and a portion of the open bleachers in left-field were saved. A meeting of the directors of the club was held that afternoon to discuss the future of the field. The option to start the season on the old Union League grounds or have Boston or New York host the opening series of the games at their parks were considered.

Plans for an extension of the park had been started over a year before the fire. A site located at Florida Avenue and 7th Street NW had been purchased to build a structure similar to Shibe Park in Philadelphia or Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. However, it had been decided to postpone this project until the end of the season.

The structure was rebuilt in steel and concrete as the ballpark that later was known as Griffith Stadium. Exactly four weeks after the Washington fire, New York&#x27;s Polo Grounds would also be destroyed by fire and rebuilt with steel and concrete, further accelerating the end of the era of wooden major league ballparks.

<doc id="1288745" wikidata="Q7642605" url="?curid=1288745" title="Super Milk Chan">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series directed by and produced by Genco, Suplex, framegraphics and Geneon Entertainment for Animax. The show pre-began as 14 eight-minute segment episodes which aired on Fuji Television&#x27;s Flyer TV block from June 18 to September 24, 1998, from 24:45 to 24:55, with the animation being produced by Tokyo Kids. The full-length show, entitled , ran for 12 twenty-four-minute episodes which aired on Space Shower TV from January 27 to April 13, 2000, at 19:00 and then 18:00.

The North American DVD release by A.D. Vision features two different English-dubbed versions: a straight translation of the original Japanese version (which was aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim block on November 7, 2004 with the original vintage episodes before making its official series premiere a week later) and an Americanized version with Western pop culture references and short live-action skits featuring ADV voice cast members.

==Summary==
The show centers on the activities of Milk, a young 5-year-old superheroine who may or may not actually have any powers and usually can do very little besides making popular culture references. Its American slogan, as a result, became &quot;Wholesome? Probably not. Good for you? Definitely.&quot; She lives in a house on a suspended platform with her malfunctioning robotic maid Tetsuko and her drunken pet slug Hanage (nosehair). The show follows a fairly linear formula. In each episode, the President (of &quot;Everything&quot;, according to his name) calls with a new mission; whether Milk actually takes the mission is not guaranteed. Regardless of whether or not she takes the mission, she always takes credit and celebrates her success by going out for &quot;sushi (or something).&quot; Likewise, there are a number of other constants that follow through the series, often under contrived circumstances.

==Major characters==
:
:The title character of the show, Milk is an infantile little girl whose status as a superhero is questionable. She is often selfish, vain, short-tempered, and has a habit of drooling, but is not devoid of decent qualities. She harbors a love-hate relationship with the President and Tetsuko, alternating between tormenting them and getting along with them. Although she works officially for the President, she chooses on her own whether or not she wants to follow his orders. Coincidentally, her house is in the shape of a baby bottle and she still drinks powdered milk from a baby bottle on occasion.
:
:An obsolete robot maid, Tetsuko was created at the King&#x27;s Idea Laboratory in 1982. She lives with and works for Milk. Tetsuko is a more conservative character, the only occasional voice of reason on the show when she is questioning Milk&#x27;s greedy, questionable, or random decisions. She yearns for a stable traditional family life, which the living organisms around her do not even consider. Milk often calls her a piece of junk and Tetsuko is torn between loving Dr. Eyepatch (who may or may not be her &quot;daddy&quot;) and being disappointed in him when he insults her or offers to replace her. She has the ability to generate a fart (&quot;Tetsuko&#x27;s gas&quot;) that is lethal enough to even kill a raging bear. The only character that brings out Tetsuko&#x27;s aggressive side is Robodog, whom she hates. They are in a constant conflict over Milk&#x27;s affection, much to Milk&#x27;s amusement.
:
:Hanage is Milk&#x27;s green, middle-aged pet slug known as a &quot;Hanage&quot;. He has a drinking problem and is incapable of speech, though he can understand multiple languages. When he does speak, it&#x27;s usually to express his thoughts; often a maudlin soliloquy, that are referred to as &quot;the voice of Hanage&#x27;s heart.&quot; &quot;Hanage&quot; means &quot;nose hair&quot; in Japanese.
:
:The President is a stout bald man who apparently runs the country Milk lives in (referred to only as &quot;our nation&quot;, a subtle reference to the Japanese habit of referring to their country as such instead of using the proper names &quot;Nihon&quot; or &quot;Nippon&quot;). No one knows how he achieved his office. He assigns missions to Milk, but whether she takes them or not is her prerogative. The President proves to be inept and incapable at fulfilling his job, at one point firing his country&#x27;s best missile (The Punishment Missile) on his own country at his own conclusion that his citizens would try to put him in the Guillotine or the electric chair. He has short, round arms and he frequently pounds on his desk when talking on the phone. The President likes wine, women, and song but he usually &quot;enjoys&quot; cheap wine, loose women, and off-key karaoke. He also attracts flies and dearly loves his pet cat, Kanchi. His desk is decorated with a different anime or pop culture character figure on every episode.
:
:A mysterious blue humanoid with an eyepatch, a black cloak, and a robotic arm, Dr. Eyepatch runs the . In each episode, he provides Milk with a new invention or gives information about topics of concern. Whether he created Tetsuko or not is never fully explained, but he always belittles her or offers to have her replaced. The eyepatch over Dr. Eyepatch&#x27;s right eye changes its design every episode; sometimes it changes several times in the course of a single episode. He is seen only on a TV screen and he also once hosted the NG awards.
:
:A purple-haired and white-skinned humanoid dressed in blue clothes and with a head shaped like a daikon radish. He is Milk&#x27;s landlord. As Milk is perpetually over six months behind on her rent, he continually tries to get payment from her. However, whenever he tries to get the rent, she does or says something that shocks or tricks him, causing him to run back across the ladder to his own home. He is also anxious, as he once thought he lost his &quot;purse,&quot; but shortly finds it after making a racket over it. The landlord is gay and this was disclosed in the Japanese version of Episode 9, &quot;Financial Decay Peninsula&quot;. His being gay is openly referred to in more than one episode.
:
:A family of ants (a mother, a cuckolded father, and a baby larva) live underground near Milk&#x27;s house. Their portion of the show chronicles their constant marital troubles. The family consists of , an overbearing, suspicious husband, , an unfaithful wife, and , their son. The family seems pretty neutral in the first three episodes, but things start to get tense afterwards. After noticing his wife&#x27;s behavior and realizing that she is cheating, Yoshiki becomes more and more enraged, while Helen just denies it or changes the subject and talks to Ario. Eventually, Helen takes Ario and leaves. In the final episode of the show, Yoshiki writes a letter to his family and commits suicide.

==Other characters==
;Haruo: A robot that Tetsuko has a crush on. He only appears in the 1998 series.

;The Counterfeiter: A counterfeiter who (really) likes Belgian waffles. He makes counterfeit bills to buy a lot of them. In the Japanese version, the real currency has pictures of &quot;Kin&quot; while the counterfeit bills have pictures of &quot;Gin&quot; - a reference to the oldest-living twins. In the Americanized version, the bills are differentiated by pictures of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

;The Colonel: Presumably from the Navy, he and his assistant try in vain to get in contact with The President in trying to stop the Punishment Missile, but to no avail; The President is on the phone with Milk and quickly forgot about said missile. Quickly becoming a nervous wreck, The Colonel tries to get help from Dr. Eyepatch, only for the doctor to be absolutely unhelpful.

;Kyuu the Myna Bird: A bird that Tetsuko started keeping, but died the next week. It looks like a toucan. His favorite thing is &quot;Chaushu&quot; and his favorite kind of girl is bouncy. One episode later, he is revealed to have died right away, like most myna birds do.
:
:A very cute cat wearing a red dress that runs away from the president finding him disgusting for being too clinging and Milk and the gang have to find her. She is found in a place called Meow Meow World. At first she refuses to return to the president and claims that she can get by with subsidized dating, but after Milk reads the president&#x27;s letter, she is moved to tears and decides to return. She was first found by the president in a cardboard box on a rainy day.

;Leonardo the Japanese Bear: A violent bear from an Osaka bear farm. He defeats Robo Willy, but gets knocked out by Tetsuko&#x27;s gas attack.

;: A mentally disabled man dressed as a kindergarten student. He tries to get kids to play with him, but they can&#x27;t because their parents said they couldn&#x27;t. He gets shocked and throws a tantrum whenever they say he&#x27;s not a kid. His name is a parody of &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot;.

;Keizao Butae/Colonel Flanders: The factory manager of the Gentucky Pork Legs Factory, who resembles Colonel Sanders. While hitting on an employee, he accidentally presses the laser control button, shutting down the power of the Pork Gun which allows Tonkichi &amp; Tononko to escape. Keizao then hires a hitman to take them out.

;Barazou: A live-action cross-dressing man who appears frequently on the news. In the Americanized version, he is cut out and replaced by someone else.

;: Akiko is heard but never seen. She is seemingly a young Japanese girl who does video art. Her &quot;art&quot; is never much more than a pretentious monologue read by her as she takes a video of normal things happening in Japan. The videos are live action and cut randomly into the show in various episodes.

;Tonkichi &amp; Tonko / Palmer &amp; Penny: Two pigs that are in love with each other. After escaping the Gentucky Pork Legs Factory, they defect to a country where people don&#x27;t eat pork. As soon as they arrive, they are turned into pork legs by a hired hitman. Tonkichi may be a reference to the pig with the same name from the anime &quot;Hamtaro&quot; (though Hamtaro&#x27;s English dub calls the pig Herbert)

==King&#x27;s Idea Laboratory Mechas==
:
:A rude, incontinent robot that Dr. Eyepatch made to help on some of Milk&#x27;s missions. Tetsuko and he are bitter rivals. Robodog winds up causing a lot of conflict and trouble on Milk&#x27;s missions.

<doc id="1288758" wikidata="Q1195125" url="?curid=1288758" title="Cubans">
<text>Cubans () are the citizens and nationals of Cuba. The Cuban people have varied origins with the most spoken language being Spanish. The larger Cuban diaspora includes individuals that trace ancestry to Cuba and self-identify as Cuban but are not necessarily Cuban by citizenship. The United States has the largest Cuban population in the world after Cuba. 

The modern nation of Cuba, located in the Caribbean, emerged as an independent country following the Spanish-American War of 1898, which led to the end of Spanish colonial rule. The subsequent period of American influence, culminating in the formal independence of Cuba in 1902, initiated a complex process of national identity formation. This identity is characterized by a blend of Indigenous Taíno, African, and Spanish cultural elements, reflecting a unique multicultural heritage. The Cuban Revolution of 1959, which brought Fidel Castro to power, marked a significant turning point as it transformed the political landscape, reinforced a sense of national identity centered around revolutionary and socialist ideals and led to the continuing Cuban exodus, establishing the Cuban Diaspora.

==Racial and ethnic groups==
===Census===
The population of Cuba was 11,167,325 inhabitants in 2012.
The largest urban populations of Cubans in Cuba (2012) are to be found in Havana (2,106,146), Santiago de Cuba (506,037), Holguín (346,195), Camagüey (323,309), Santa Clara (240,543) and Guantánamo (228,436).

===European or white===


In the 2012 Census of Cuba, 64.1% of the inhabitants self-identified as white. Based on genetic testing (2014) in Cuba, the average percentages of European, African and Native American ancestry in those auto-reporting to be white were 86%, 6.7%, and 7.8%, respectively. The majority of the European ancestry comes from Spain.

===Black or African===

The Afro-Cuban population was 9.3% in the 2012 Census of Cuba. Just about 1.3 million Cubans described themselves as black. Thus a significant proportion of those living on the island affirm some sub-Saharan African ancestry. 

Based on genetic testing in 2014, the average African, European and Native American ancestry in those self-reporting to be &quot;negro (Black)&quot; was 65.5% &quot;African&quot;, 29% &quot;European&quot; ancestry and 5.5% &quot;Native American&quot; or other ancestry.

Although Afro-Cubans can be found throughout Cuba, Eastern Cuba has a higher concentration of Blacks than other parts of the island. Havana has the largest population of blacks of any city in Cuba.

===Multiracial===

In the 2012 Census of Cuba, 26.6% (2.97 million) of the Cubans self-identified as mulatto or mestizo.

===East Asian===

Officially called &quot;amarilla&quot; (&quot;yellow&quot; in English) in the Cuban census, Cubans of East Asian origins made up 1.02% of the population in the 2002 Census of Cuba. They are primarily made up of ethnic Chinese who are descendants of indentured laborers who came in the 19th century to build railroads and work in mines. Historically, Chinese descendants in Cuba were once classified as &quot;white&quot;.

===Amerindian===
The number of people identifying as Taíno has not been formally recorded. Most of them live on the eastern part of the island, notably in Granma, Guantánamo, and Las Tunas. 

The intermixing between European settlers and the native Taíno was prevalent in the early colonial era. Their mixed-race descendants have been historically undercounted. 

According to a 2018 genome-wide data study, the eastern region of the island had an average Native American ancestry contribution of 10%, as compared to an average of 5% in the rest of the island.

Additionally, many North American Indians living in Spanish missions in Georgia and Florida were evacuated to Spanish Cuba along with the fleeing Spanish settlers following the loss of Spanish Florida. As a result, descendants of the Calusa, Tequesta, Timucua and other now-extinct indigenous peoples of Florida have been assimilated into the mainstream Cuban population. They comprise part of Cuba&#x27;s Amerindian genetic makeup.

Intermarriage between diverse groups is so frequent as to be the rule.

==Population changes==
Cuba&#x27;s birth rate (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006) is one of the lowest in the Western Hemisphere. Its overall population increased from around 7 million in 1961 to 11 million today, but the rate of increase slowed over time and has recently turned to a decrease, with the Cuban government in 2006 reporting the first drop in the population since the Mariel boatlift. Immigration and emigration have had noticeable effects on the demographic profile of Cuba during the 20th century. Between 1900 and 1930, close to a million Spaniards migrated to the island.

Since 1959, over two million Cubans have left the island, primarily to Miami, Florida, where a vocal, well-educated and economically successful exile community exists.

==Genetics==

An autosomal study from 2014 found the genetic ancestry in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Amerindian. Of note, there is high variability between regions within Cuba, with individuals from Western provinces having higher European ancestry on average, and those in the Eastern region having more African and Native American genetic contribution. Cuban genealogy has become a rising interest for Cubans in the last 15 years.

A 1995 study done on the population of Pinar del Río, found that 50% of the Mt-DNA lineages (female lineages) could be traced back to Europeans, 46% to Africans and 3% to Americans. This figure is consistent with both the historical background of the region, and the current demographics of it. According to another study in 2008, regarding the geographical origin attributed to each mtDNA haplogroup, 55% of the sequences found in Cubans are of West Eurasian origin (namely, Europe and the Middle East) and 45% of African origin
Regarding Y-chromosome haplogroups (male lineages), 78.8% of the sequences found in Cubans are of West Eurasian origin, 19.7% of African origin and 1.5% of East Asian origin. Among the West Eurasian fraction, the vast majority of individuals belong to West European haplogroup R1b. The African lineages found in Cubans have a Western (haplogroups E1, E2, E1b1a ) and Northern (E1b1b-M81 ) African origin. The North African haplogroup E1b1b1b (E-M81), is found at a frequency of 6.1%.

According to Fregel et al. (2009), the fact that autochthonous male E-M81 and female U6 lineages from the Canaries have been detected in Cuba and Iberoamerica, demonstrates that Canary Islanders with indigenous Guanche ancestors actively participated in the American colonization.
==Cubans abroad==

The United States has the largest number of Cubans outside Cuba. As of 2023, the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey showed a total population of 1,450,808 Cuban immigrants. As of 2015, 68% of Cuban-born residents of the United States have naturalized automatically losing their Cuban citizenship. Significant populations of Cubans exist in the cities of Hialeah and Miami in Florida (995,439 Cubans in this state in 2017) and in Texas (60,381), New Jersey (44,974), California (35,364), New York (26,875), and Illinois (22,541) 

The second largest Cuban diaspora is in Spain. As of 2019, there were 151,423 Cubans in Spain. Smaller numbers of Cubans live in Brazil, Uruguay, Italy*, Mexico*, and Canada.

After the founding of the republic in 1902, a considerable migration (over 1 million) arrived from the Iberian peninsula to the island, between them were more than a few former Spanish soldiers who participated in the wars, and yet it never created an obstacle for the respect and affection of Cubans, who have always been proud of their origins.
In December 2008, Spain began accepting citizenship applications from the descendants of people who went into exile after its brutal 1936-39 Civil War, part of a 2007 law meant to address the painful legacy of the conflict. This new Historical Memory Law has granted to more than 140,000 Cubans of Spanish ancestry the Spanish citizenship, and there were 143,048 Cubans with Spanish citizenship in Cuba and 93,004 in Spain on January 1, 2019. Under the law, the descendants had until December 2011 to present themselves at the Spanish embassy in their home country and turn in documentation that proves their parents or grandparents fled Spain between 1936 and 1955. They did not need to relinquish their current citizenship.

==History==

The first people known to have inhabited Cuba was the Siboney, an Amerindian people. They were followed by another Amerindian people, the Taíno who were the main population both of Cuba and other islands in The Antilles when Christopher Columbus first sighted the island in 1492. He claimed the islands for Spain and Cuba became a Spanish colony. It was to remain so until 1902 apart from a brief occupation by Britain in 1762, before being returned in exchange for Florida. 

Towards the end of the 19th century, Spain had lost most of its American possessions and a series of rebellions had shaken Cuba. This, combined with calls for annexation of Cuba in the United States, led to the Spanish–American War, and in 1902 Cuba gained formal independence.

During the first decades of the 20th century, USA interests were dominant and in Cuba, leading to large influence over the island. This ended in 1959 when de facto leader Fulgencio Batista was ousted by revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro. Quickly deteriorating relations with the US led to Cuba&#x27;s alliance with the Soviet Union and Castro&#x27;s transformation of Cuba into a declared socialist republic. Cuban soldiers were sent overseas to fight in the Angolan Civil War and Ogaden War in the 1970s-1980s. Castro remained in power until 2008, first as Prime Minister then from 1976 as President of Cuba. Fidel was succeeded by his brother Raúl Castro.Miguel Díaz-Canel succeeds the brothers Fidel and Raúl Castro, making him the first non-Castro leader of Cuba since the revolution in 2018.Miguel Mario Díaz-Canel y Bermúdez (Spanish: [mi.ˈɣel ˈdi.as kaˈnel]; born 20 April 1960) is a politician and engineer who is the third first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba.

==Culture and traditions==

The culture of Cuba reflects the island&#x27;s influences from various cultures, primarily European 
(Spanish),Taino and African.

One of the most distinctive parts of Cuban culture is Cuban music and dancing, being well-known far outside the country. Well known Hispanic music styles such as mambo, salsa, rumba, cha-cha-chá, bolero, and son originated in Cuba. The origins of much of Cuban music can be found in the mix of Spanish and West African music, while American musical elements such as trombones and big band were also significant elements in the formation of Cuban music. Cuban literature includes some of the most well-known names of the islands, such as writer and independence hero José Martí in the late 19th century. More contemporary Cuban authors include Daína Chaviano, Pedro Juan Gutiérrez, Antonio Orlando Rodríguez, Zoé Valdés and Leonardo Padura Fuentes.

The Spanish language is spoken by virtually all Cubans on the island itself. Cuban Spanish is characterized by the reduction of several consonants, a feature that it shares with other dialects of Caribbean Spanish as well as the Canary Islands. Many Cuban-Americans, while remaining fluent in Spanish, use American English as one of their daily languages.

==Religion==

Cuba&#x27;s prevailing religion is Roman Catholicism, although in some instances it is profoundly modified and influenced through syncretism. A common syncretic religion is Santería, which combined the Yoruba religion of the African slaves with some Catholicism; it shows similarities to Brazilian Umbanda and has been receiving a degree of official support.

The Roman Catholic Church estimates that 60 percent of the population is Catholic, with 10 percent attending mass regularly, while independent sources estimate that as few 1.5 percent of Catholics do so.

Membership in Protestant churches is estimated to be 5 percent and includes Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, Presbyterians, Episcopal Church of Cuba|Episcopalians, Methodists, Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and Lutherans. Other groups include the Greek Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, Baháʼís, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Cuba is home to a variety of syncretic religions of largely African cultural origin. According to a US State Department report, some sources estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population consults with practitioners of religions with West African roots, such as Santeria or Yoruba. Santería developed out of the traditions of the Yoruba, one of the African peoples who were imported to Cuba during the 16th through 19th centuries to work on the sugar plantations. Santería blends elements of Christianity and West African beliefs and as such made it possible for the slaves to retain their traditional beliefs while appearing to practice Catholicism. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (Our Lady Of Charity) is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and is greatly revered by the Cuban people and seen as a symbol of Cuba. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess Ochún. The important religious festival &quot;La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre&quot; is celebrated by Cubans annually on 8 September. Other religions practised are Palo Monte, and Abakuá, which have large parts of their liturgy in African languages.

===Symbols===

The flag of Cuba is red, white, and blue; and was first adopted by Narciso López on a suggestion by the poet Miguel Teurbe Tolón. The design incorporates three blue stripes, representing the three provinces of the time (Oriente, Centro, and Occidente), and two white stripes symbolizing the purity of the patriotic cause. The red triangle stands for the blood shed to free the nation. The white star in the triangle stands for independence.

<doc id="1288782" wikidata="Q7090402" url="?curid=1288782" title="Omnism">
<text>Omnism is the belief in all religions. Those who hold this belief are called omnists. In recent years, the term has been resurfacing due to the interest of modern-day self-described omnists who have rediscovered and begun to redefine the term. Omnism is similar to syncretism, the belief in a fusion of faiths in harmony. However, it can also be seen as a way to accept the existence of various religions without believing in all that they profess to teach. Many omnists say that all religions contain truths, but that no one religion offers all that is truth.

== Contemporary usage ==
Contemporary usage has modified &quot;belief in all religions&quot; to refer more to an acceptance of the legitimacy of all religions. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; elaborates that an omnist believes &quot;in a single transcendent purpose or cause uniting all things or people&quot;. Omnists interpret this to mean that all religions contain varying elements of a common truth, that omnists are open to potential truths from all religions. 
The Oxford dictionary defines an omnist as &quot;a person who believes in all faiths or creeds; a person who believes in a single transcendent purpose or cause uniting all things or people, or the members of a particular group of people&quot;. Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury, considered the first Deist, argued that all religions were true. In the poem &quot;All Religions are One&quot;, William Blake professed that every religion originated from God&#x27;s revelation. Henry Stubbe and other Socinians synthesized a form of &quot;Muhammadan Christianity&quot;. Unitarian Universalism, which grew out of the Protestant Reformation, practices omnist beliefs. Other notable interfaith organizations include the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples and The Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions was the first organization with the goal to unite all religions.

== Notable omnists ==
* Philip James Bailey, who first coined the term.
* Ellen Burstyn, who affiliates herself with all religions, having stated that she is &quot;a spirited opening to the truth that lives in all of these religions&quot;.
* John Coltrane, after a self-described religious experience that helped him kick his heroin and alcohol addictions, he became more deeply spiritual, later saying &quot;I believe in all religions.&quot;
* Kyrie Irving, who stated that he is an omnist in response to condemnation of his promotion of the documentary &quot;Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America&quot;.
* Chris Martin, who referred to himself as an &quot;all-theist&quot;, a term of his own coining referring to omnism.
* Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, who identifies himself as every religion since he doesn&#x27;t want to exclude or alienate others of different faiths. He has stated that: &quot;You&#x27;re going to believe what you believe. The Muslim religion and all these religions have been around for thousands and thousands of years. So who am I to say, &#x27;Hey, don&#x27;t do this, don&#x27;t do that.&#x27; You believe what they believe, respect what they respect, and respect that person as a man or woman, and you&#x27;ll make it far in life. The fact is I&#x27;m Muslim, I&#x27;m Jewish, I&#x27;m Buddhist, I&#x27;m everybody &#x27;cause I&#x27;m a people person.
* Ramakrishna, the Hindu mystic, believed in all religions being true.

<text>Jams is a line of clothing produced by Jams World.

==History==
Company founder Dave Rochlen was a beach lifeguard and surfer, originally in Santa Monica, California, then in Hawaii. After reading a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article showing Russians looking comfortable attending the beach in bathrobes, Rochlen bought some brightly colored floral fabric and asked his wife Keanuenue to make a short, baggy pair of pajamas with a sewn-up fly and cut-off at the knee. They produced the first pair of Jams on December 25, 1964.
Rochlen quit his job as a systems analyst and started his new company Surf Line Hawaii, Ltd. to make and sell his new product; its name, Jams, was a shortening of &quot;pajamas&quot;. Rochlen explained the name as &quot;I thought of it. It&#x27;s part of the word &#x27;pajamas,&#x27; of course, and it was what I wanted – short, quick, jargon, hip, young, one-syllable.&quot;

Soon after his first commercial pairs of Jams were worn at Mākaha, Hawaii, &quot;Life&quot; magazine ran a two-page spread on Rochlen and a group of his surfing friends in the June 1965 issue. After the article, the Jams line was sold in Bloomingdales, Macy&#x27;s, and Lord &amp; Taylor. By 1991, Surf Line Hawaii&#x27;s annual sales totaled about US$7 million. Its garments were all cut, sewn and manufactured in a Honolulu factory.
The Jams look was baggy and bohemian, with wild prints and clashing pinks and greens. It was a clear departure from the more subtle color combinations and detailing of existing boardshorts.

<doc id="1288800" wikidata="Q7427684" url="?curid=1288800" title="Savage, Maryland">
<text>Savage is an unincorporated community and census-designated place located in Howard County, Maryland, United States, approximately south of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C. It is situated close to the city of Laurel and to the planned community of Columbia. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 7,542. The former mill town is a registered historic place, and has several original buildings preserved within and around the Savage Mill Historic District.

==History==


===17th century===
The lands of present-day Savage were first settled in approximately 1650. Colonel Henry Ridgley surveyed the land around Savage Mill and nearby Annapolis Junction, Maryland in 1685, naming the tract &quot;Ridgely&#x27;s Forrest&quot;. Joseph White was the grandson of Peregrine White, the first child born of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; expedition.

===18th century===
In 1734, he opened a gristmill on land patented as &quot;Whites Fortune&quot; and &quot;Mill Land&quot;. The parcels were consolidated to become &quot;Whites Contrivance&quot;.

A rich vein of American industrial history lies in Savage. When the textile industry was in its heyday, Savage was an important manufacturing center, its mills harnessing the water power on the falls of the Little and Middle Patuxent rivers.

The town was named for John Savage, a Philadelphia merchant with interest in a mill on the falls of the Little Patuxent. In 1822, he and his associates, the Williams brothers, chartered the Savage Manufacturing Company, purchasing of the White property for $6,666.67. The company produced sails for the clipper ships that sailed out of Baltimore Harbor, in addition to a wide variety of other cotton products.

===19th century===
The cotton milling industry started in Maryland in the 18th century and flourished in the 19th century. Cotton was shipped cheaply from Southern ports and hauled overland by mule and oxen teams to the mills before rail transportation served Savage. In 1835 the Washington branch of the B&amp;O Railroad was completed, and Savage Station was established on the line about a mile southeast of the present mill. A spur of the B&amp;O was laid to the Savage factory in 1887, and it was at this time that the famous Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge was moved to its present site from another location. Originally built in 1852, it was one of about 100 on the B&amp;O line. Beloved by railroad buffs, the iron truss bridge is the only one of its type in the world, and, along with the Savage Mill, is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Savage post office opened on January 13, 1836, on &quot;Yankee Hill&quot; at the corner of Washington and Foundry streets with Amos Adams Williams as postmaster. It would later become a branch of the Patuxent Bank of Laurel.

Parts of the Savage Mill are said to date from about 1820, and historians have recorded that the mill once had an iron foundry that made many kinds of machinery, specializing in textile manufacturing. The operation of the mill was greatly expanded in 1880 with the installation of steam power. Army uniforms, field tents, and vehicle covers were made.

===20th century===
A renovation program began in 1984 that established Savage Mill as a major permanent marketplace. The Savage Mill Manor House is down the street from the mill and has also been completely renovated. It is now used to host weddings, parties, and special events.

Carroll Baldwin Hall once housed the Savage branch of the Howard County Library. It was built in the early 1920s as a memorial to Carroll Baldwin, former president of the manufacturing company. The Baldwins managed the company from 1859 to 1911.

In 1880, the population reached 2,617 residents, and increased to 2,930 in 1890.

In 1929, Dr. Wolman issued a recommendation that did not pass, to dam and flood the Patuxent River Valley around Savage for a dedicated water source.

Savage remained a mostly segregated town for most of its early history until the Civil rights movement of the 1950s. Factory work at the mill was almost exclusively for white workers with exceptions of black apprentices at the forges in the antebellum era. The community slowly integrated in the latter half of the 20th century.

The Savage Volunteer Fire Company was founded in 1937 with a station at Savage-Guilford Road. The station relocated to Lincoln Street in 1957, and Corridor Road in 2013.

In June 1972, Hurricane Agnes flooded the local rivers, raising the Patuxent River 25.4 feet, and washing out the road bridge. A replacement opened on September 10, 1975.

In 1976, county executive Edward L. Cochran convened a waste task force that reviewed submissions for a 538-acre landfill at route One and 32 owned by Realty Trust and Chase Manhattan Mortgage, with commercial dumping sites at the Savage quarry. Alpha Ridge Landfill was selected instead, but a new quarry would eventually take its place.

A new $7 million elementary school was built in Savage in 1988, named Bollman Bridge Elementary.

==Geography==
Savage is located in southeastern Howard County, bordered by Columbia to the north and North Laurel to the southwest. U.S. Route 1 (Washington Boulevard) forms the southeast edge of the CDP. The historic Savage mill village is located in the southern part of the CDP, while a major freeway interchange between Interstate 95 and Maryland Route 32 sits on the northern edge of the CDP.

The Middle Patuxent and Little Patuxent rivers join to the west of the mill village. The Middle Patuxent (above the confluence) and the Little Patuxent (below the confluence) form the southwest edge of the CDP. The river drops about in to form the falls that powered the early mills. The Little Patuxent continues southeast to join the Patuxent River at Crofton.

<text>Chung-Yao Chao (; 27 June 1902 – 28 May 1998) was a Chinese theoretical physicist. He studied the scattering of gamma rays in lead by pair production in 1930, without knowing that positrons were involved in the anomalously high scattering cross-section. When the positron was discovered by Carl David Anderson in 1932, confirming the existence of Paul Dirac&#x27;s &quot;antimatter&quot;, it became clear that positrons could explain Chung-Yao Chao&#x27;s earlier experiments, with the gamma rays being emitted from electron-positron annihilation.

He entered Nanjing Higher Normal School (later renamed National Southeastern University, National Central University and Nanjing University), in 1920 and earned a BS in physics in 1925. Then he earned a PhD degree in physics under supervision of Nobel Prize laureate Robert Andrews Millikan at California Institute of Technology in 1930. Later he went back to China and joined the physics faculty of Tsinghua University in Beijing.

==Nobel Prize controversy==
The 1936 Nobel Prize for Physics went to Carl D. Anderson for the discovery of the positron. While a graduate student at Caltech in 1930, Chao was the first to experimentally identify positrons through electron–positron annihilation, but did not realize what they were. Anderson, Chao&#x27;s classmate at Caltech, used the same radioactive source, , as Chao. (Historically, was known as &quot;thorium C double prime&quot; or &quot;ThC&quot;, see decay chains.) Fifty years later, Anderson admitted that Chao had inspired his discovery: Chao&#x27;s research formed the foundation from which much of Anderson&#x27;s own work developed. Chao died in 1998, without sharing in a Nobel Prize acknowledgment.

<text>Ceratopsia or Ceratopia ( or ; Greek: &quot;horned faces&quot;) is a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs that thrived in what are now North America, Asia and Europe, during the Cretaceous Period, although ancestral forms lived earlier, in the Late Jurassic of Asia. The earliest known ceratopsian, &quot;Yinlong downsi&quot;, lived between 161.2 and 155.7 million years ago. The last ceratopsian species, &quot;Triceratops prorsus&quot;, became extinct during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, .

&quot;Triceratops&quot; is by far the best-known ceratopsian to the general public. It is traditional for ceratopsian genus names to end in &quot;-ceratops&quot;, although this is not always the case. One of the first named genera was &quot;Ceratops&quot; itself, which lent its name to the group, although it is considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; today as its fossil remains have no distinguishing characteristics that are not also found in other ceratopsians.

==Description==
Early members of the ceratopsian group, such as &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot;, were small bipedal animals. Later members, including ceratopsids like &quot;Centrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Triceratops&quot;, became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from predators, they may also have been used for display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from and to over and .

Ceratopsians are easily recognized by features of the skull. On the tip of a ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the chewing of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are prominent, flaring out sideways to make the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.

The neck frills of ceratopsids are surrounded by the epoccipital bones. The name is a misnomer, as they are not associated with the occipital bone. Epoccipitals begin as separate bones that fuse during the animal&#x27;s growth to either the squamosal or parietal bones that make up the base of the frill. These bones were ornamental instead of functional, and may have helped differentiate species. Epoccipitals probably were present in all known ceratopsids. They appear to have been broadly different between short-frilled ceratopsids (centrosaurines) and long-frilled ceratopsids (chasmosaurines), being elliptical with constricted bases in the former group, and triangular with wide bases in the latter group. Within these broad definitions, different species would have somewhat different shapes and numbers. In centrosaurines especially, like &quot;Centrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Pachyrhinosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Styracosaurus&quot;, these bones become long and spike- or hook-like. A well-known example is the coarse sawtooth fringe of broad triangular epoccipitals on the frill of &quot;Triceratops&quot;. When regarding the ossification&#x27;s morphogenetic traits, it can be described as dermal. The term &quot;epoccipital&quot; was coined by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889.

==History of study==
The first ceratopsian remains known to science were discovered during the U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories led by the American geologist F.V. Hayden. Teeth discovered during an 1855 expedition to Montana were first assigned to hadrosaurids and included within the genus &quot;Trachodon&quot;. It was not until the early 20th century that some of these were recognized as ceratopsian teeth. During another of Hayden&#x27;s expeditions in 1872, Fielding Bradford Meek found several giant bones protruding from a hillside in southwestern Wyoming. He alerted paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who led a dig to recover the partial skeleton. Cope recognized the remains as a dinosaur, but noted that even though the fossil lacked a skull, it was different from any type of dinosaur then known. He named the new species &quot;Agathaumas sylvestris&quot;, meaning &quot;marvellous forest-dweller&quot;. Soon after, Cope named two more dinosaurs that would eventually come to be recognized as ceratopsids: &quot;Polyonax&quot; and &quot;Monoclonius&quot;. &quot;Monoclonius&quot; was notable for the number of disassociated remains found, including the first evidence of ceratopsid horns and frills. Several &quot;Monoclonius&quot; fossils were found by Cope, assisted by Charles Hazelius Sternberg, in summer 1876 near the Judith River in Chouteau County, Montana. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal horn core, nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The frill bone was interpreted as a part of the breastbone.

In 1888 and 1889, Othniel Charles Marsh described the first well preserved horned dinosaurs, &quot;Ceratops&quot; and &quot;Triceratops&quot;. In 1890 Marsh classified them together in the family Ceratopsidae and the order Ceratopsia. This prompted Cope to reexamine his own specimens and to realize that &quot;Triceratops&quot;, &quot;Monoclonius&quot;, and &quot;Agathaumas&quot; all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs, which he named Agathaumidae in 1891. Cope redescribed &quot;Monoclonius&quot; as a horned dinosaur, with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the eyes, and a large frill.

==Classification==

Ceratopsia was coined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890 to include dinosaurs possessing certain characteristic features, including horns, a rostral bone, teeth with two roots, fused neck vertebrae, and a forward-oriented pubis. Marsh considered the group distinct enough to warrant its own suborder within Ornithischia. The name is derived from the Greek &quot;κέρας&quot;/&quot;kéras&quot; meaning &#x27;horn&#x27; and &quot;ὄψῐς&quot;/&quot;ópsis&quot; meaning &#x27;appearance, view&#x27; and by extension &#x27;face&#x27;. As early as the 1960s, it was noted that the name &quot;Ceratopsia&quot; is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be &quot;Ceratopia&quot;. However, this spelling, while technically correct, has been used only rarely in the scientific literature, and the vast majority of paleontologists continue to use Ceratopsia. As the ICZN does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily, this is unlikely to change.

Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has usually been classified as a suborder within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most who still employ the use of ranks have retained its traditional ranking of suborder, though some have reduced to the level of infraorder.

===Phylogeny===

In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia is officially defined in the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; as &quot;the largest clade containing &quot;Ceratops montanus&quot; and &quot;Triceratops horridus&quot;, but not &quot;Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis&quot;. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are the family Chaoyangsauridae and the well known genus &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot;, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were discovered in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.

The clade Neoceratopsia is defined as &quot;the largest clade containing &quot;Triceratops horridus&quot;, but not &quot;Chaoyangsaurus youngi&quot; and &quot;Psittacosaurus mongoliensis&quot;&quot;. By this definition, only the members of Chaoyangosauridae and &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; are excluded from Neoceratopsia, while all more derived ceratopsians are part of this clade. A slightly less inclusive group is Euceratopsia, named and defined by Daniel Madzia and colleagues in 2021 as &quot;the smallest clade containing &quot;Leptoceratops gracilis&quot;, &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot;, and &quot;Triceratops horridus&quot;&quot;. This clade includes the family Leptoceratopsidae and all more derived ceratopsians. Leptoceratopsids are a mostly North American group of mostly small bodied and quadrupedal ceratopsians. Another subset of neoceratopsians is called Coronosauria, which is &quot;the smallest clade containing &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot; and &quot;Triceratops horridus&quot;&quot;. Coronosaurs show the first development of the neck frill and the fusion of the first several neck vertebrae to support the increasingly heavy head. Within Coronosauria, two groups are generally recognized. One group can be called Protoceratopsidae and includes &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and its closest relatives, all Asian. The other group, Ceratopsoidea, includes the family Ceratopsidae and closely related animals like &quot;Zuniceratops&quot;. This clade is defined as &quot;the largest clade containing &quot;Ceratops montanus&quot; and &quot;Triceratops horridus&quot;, but not &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot;&quot;. Ceratopsidae itself includes &quot;Triceratops&quot; and all the large North American ceratopsians and is further divided into the subfamilies Centrosaurinae and Chasmosaurinae.

All previously published neoceratopsian phylogenetic analyses were incorporated into the analysis of Eric M. Morschhauser and colleagues in 2019, along with all previously published diagnostic species excluding the incomplete juvenile &quot;Archaeoceratops yujingziensis&quot; and the problematic genera &quot;Bainoceratops&quot;, &quot;Lamaceratops&quot;, &quot;Platyceratops&quot; and &quot;Gobiceratops&quot; that are very closely related to and potentially synonymous with &quot;Bagaceratops&quot;. While there were many unresolved areas of the strict consensus, including all of Leptoceratopsidae, a single most parsimonious tree was found that was most consistent with the relative ages of the taxa included, which is shown below.
==Paleobiology==

Unlike almost all other dinosaur groups, skulls are the most commonly preserved elements of ceratopsian skeletons and many species are known only from skulls. There is a great deal of variation between and even within ceratopsian species. Complete growth series from embryo to adult are known for &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, allowing the study of ontogenetic variation in these species.

Most restorations of ceratopsians show them with erect hindlimbs but semi-sprawling forelimbs, which suggest that they were not fast movers. But Paul and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos, which can run at up to 56 km or 35 miles per hour.

A nocturnal lifestyle has been suggested for the primitive ceratopsian &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. However, comparisons between the scleral rings of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; and &quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; and modern birds and reptiles indicate that they may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.

==Paleoecology==
===Paleobiogeography===

Ceratopsia appears to have originated in Asia, as all of the earliest members are found there. Fragmentary remains, including teeth, which appear to be neoceratopsian, are found in North America from the Albian stage (112 to 100 million years ago), indicating that the group had dispersed across what is now the Bering Strait by the middle of the Cretaceous Period. Almost all leptoceratopsids are North American, aside from &quot;Udanoceratops&quot;, which may represent a separate dispersal event, back into Asia. Ceratopsids and their immediate ancestors, such as &quot;Zuniceratops&quot;, were unknown outside of western North America, and were presumed endemic to that continent. The traditional view that ceratopsoids originated in North America was called into question by the 2009 discovery of better specimens of the dubious Asian form &quot;Turanoceratops&quot;, which may it as a ceratopsid. It is unknown whether this would indicates ceratopsids actually originated in Asia, or if the &quot;Turanoceratops&quot; immigrated from North America.

Possible ceratopsians from the Southern Hemisphere include the Australian &quot;Serendipaceratops&quot;, known from an ulna, and &quot;Notoceratops&quot; from Argentina is known from a single toothless jaw (which has been lost). &quot;Craspedodon&quot; from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian) of Belgium may also be a ceratopsian, specifically a neoceratopsian closer to ceratopsoidea than protoceratopsidae. Possible leptoceratopsid remains have also been described from the early Campanian of Sweden.

===Ecological role===
&quot;Psittacosaurus&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops&quot; are the most common dinosaurs in the different Mongolian sediments where they are found. &quot;Triceratops&quot; fossils are far and away the most common dinosaur remains found in the latest Cretaceous rocks in the western United States, making up as much as 5/6ths of the large dinosaur fauna in some areas. These facts indicate that some ceratopsians were the dominant herbivores in their environments.

Some species of ceratopsians, especially &quot;Centrosaurus&quot; and its relatives, appear to have been gregarious, living in herds. This is suggested by bonebed finds with the remains of many individuals of different ages. Like modern migratory herds, they would have had a significant effect on their environment, as well as serving as a major food source for predators.

<text>Inspector, also police inspector or inspector of police, is a police rank. The rank or position varies in seniority depending on the organization that uses it.

== Australia ==
In Australian police forces, the rank of inspector is generally the next senior rank from senior sergeant and is less senior than a superintendent (in the cases of the Queensland Police and Western Australia Police) in the other Australian police forces. Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring three silver pips, the same rank badge as a captain in the army. In addition to the general rank of inspector, some police forces use other ranks such as detective inspector and district inspector.

== Austria ==
In Austria a similar scheme was used as in Germany. At some point the police inspector was completely removed from the list of service ranks. The current police service has an inspectors service track with &quot;Inspektor&quot; being the entry level – it is followed by &quot;Revierinspektor&quot; (precinct inspector), &quot;Gruppeninspektor&quot; (group inspector), &quot;Bezirksinspektor&quot; (district inspector), &quot;Abteilungsinspektor&quot; (section inspector), &quot;Kontrollinspektor&quot; (control inspector) and &quot;Chefinspektor&quot; (chief inspector).

== Canada ==
In most Canadian police services the rank of inspector is the first officer/commissioned officer rank, above that of staff sergeant. It is usually immediately below the rank of superintendent. Depending on the police force, an inspector may be considered senior management. The rank insignia of an inspector in Canada is usually a crown on the epaulettes, the insignia of a major in the army. In some police services such as the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary or the Vancouver Police Department, the rank insignia are three pips, similar to the insignia of an army captain, while in others including the Toronto Police Service and Peel Regional Police, the insignia consists of two maple leaves, similar to an army lieutenant&#x27;s insignia.

Provincial police services and the majority of municipal police services, such as the Toronto Police Service have a staff inspector rank, which ranks above inspector and below superintendent.

== France ==
In the French National Police, &quot;inspecteur&quot; is a former rank of members of the Command and Management Corps. There were several grades of &quot;inspecteur&quot;, with senior detectives holding the various grades of &quot;commissaire&quot;. See French National Police for current ranks. In the French customs, &quot;inspecteur&quot; is the first rank of members of the Command and Management Corps.

== Germany ==
Currently, in Germany, &quot;Inspektor&quot; is a civil service rank. It is the lowest and therefore the entry rank of the &quot;gehobener Dienst&quot; (upper service) requiring a degree from a three-year administrative college. The rank is not used in the German police services; there the equivalent of inspector is &quot;Kommissar&quot;. In earlier times the upper service track was called &quot;Inspektorenlaufbahn&quot; (inspectors service track) ranging from &quot;Inspektor&quot;, &quot;Oberinspektor&quot; (senior inspector), &quot;Amtmann&quot;, &quot;Amtsrat&quot; to &quot;Oberamtsrat&quot; (senior supervisor).

The title is used on many professional areas that require an inspection service, like &quot;Brandinspektor&quot; (fire inspector in the fire department), &quot;Steuerinspektor&quot; (tax inspector in the financial department) and &quot;Bauinspektor&quot; (building inspector in building control) that are in a supervision position of their department. In many administrations, a corresponding position exists like &quot;Regierungsinspektor&quot; (government inspector on the federal level), &quot;Stadtinspektor&quot;/&quot;Stadtverwaltungsinspektor&quot; (city administration inspector), &quot;Kreisinspektor&quot;/&quot;Kreisverwaltungsinspektor&quot; (county administration inspector) that serve in supervision of the department.

In some regions &quot;Inspektor&quot; is a colloquial name for any police officer, just like in Austria.

== Hong Kong ==

In the Hong Kong Police Force, inspector (including probationary inspector, (senior inspector) is a rank senior to station sergeant but junior to chief inspector, leading a sub-unit between 30 and 80 people in day-to-day policing. The rank badge for probationary inspector is one silver pip on his or her epaulette; two silver pips for inspector of police; and two silver pips and one bar for senior inspector of police. The epaulettes rank badge for chief inspector is three silver pips. The epaulettes of all inspectors do not show their unique identification number. Plainclothes detective inspectors have the prefix &quot;detective&quot; identifying them as having been trained in criminal investigation and being part of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or Organised Crime Triad Bureau (OCTB).

Several of the HKP&#x27;s past and current commissioner of chiefs joined the force as a probationary inspector.

The Customs and Excise Department also has an inspector rank but with bronze stars and bars rank badges instead.

In addition, there are health inspectors from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department who carry out investigations and prosecutions on sanitary nuisances and food business irregularities under relevant ordinances. They are characterised by golden stars and yellow rank badges.

== India ==
An inspector of police in India is typically the officer in charge of a police station, and may be designated station house officer (SHO). In rural areas of some states, an inspector of police may be in charge of a police circle, which comprises two or more police stations. In this capacity, they are known as circle inspectors (CI). Inspectors oversee investigations and co-ordinate law enforcement operations in their respective jurisdictions, and may also head special units. Their insignia is three stars with a ribbon that is half red and half blue. The rank is above sub-inspector and below additional superintendent of police and deputy superintendent of police. Inspectors, along with sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors, comprise around 13% of the total police personnel in India.

== Indonesia ==
In the Indonesian National Police, there are four levels of inspector, which are &quot;Inspektur Polisi Satu&quot; (first police inspector), &quot;Inspektur Polisi Dua&quot; (senior police inspector), &quot;Ajun Inspektur Polisi Satu&quot; (first police inspector adjutant), and &quot;Ajun Inspektur Polisi Dua&quot; (second police inspector adjutant). Those ranks are below the rank of &quot;Ajun Komisaris Polisi&quot; (police commissioner adjutant) and above the rank of &quot;Brigadir Polisi Kepala&quot; (chief police brigadier).

== Ireland ==
In the &quot;Garda Síochána&quot; in the Republic of Ireland, inspectors () are senior to sergeants and junior to superintendents. Inspectors may be either detectives or in uniform. There is no rank of chief inspector in the &quot;Garda&quot;.

== Italy ==
In the &quot;Polizia di Stato&quot;, the position of &quot;Ispettore&quot; (inspector) replaced the rank of &quot;Maresciallo&quot; (marshal) after the 1981 reorganization and demilitarization of the corps; an &quot;Ispettore&quot; is thus a sergeant of several sorts, above the rank of &quot;Sovrintendente&quot; (superintendent, which is somewhat equal to a senior corporal) and under the rank of &quot;Commissario&quot; (commissioner). There are three four inspector ranks in the &quot;Polizia di Stato&quot;: &quot;Vice Ispettore&quot; (assistant inspector), &quot;Ispettore&quot; (inspector), &quot;Ispettore Capo&quot; (chief inspector) and &quot;Ispettore Superiore&quot; (special inspector, or superior inspector), roughly equivalent to the ranks ranging from junior sergeant to second lieutenant. A fifth position, called &quot;Ispettore Superiore S.U.P.S.&quot;, where the acronym stands for &quot;Sostituto Ufficiale di Pubblica Sicurezza&quot; (special inspector – substitute public safety commissioned officer), is used to designate those inspectors which can act as substitutes for commissioners in the chain of command under certain situations, or in police detachments that are too small to require the presence of a commissioner; when this happens, the officer is named &quot;Ispettore Superiore – Sostituto Commissario&quot; (special inspector – substitute commissioner). Inspectors can serve either in uniformed patrol duties, plainclothed patrol duties, or as detectives. The inspector ranks are the highest that an Italian police officer can reach without having a university degree.

== Malaysia ==
In the Royal Malaysia Police, the rank of inspector is one level above sub-inspector and one level below assistant superintendent. There are two stages: probation inspector (probation lasts within three years) and inspector. Inspectors are recruited differently from normal police constables, requiring at least a degree, and their training is longer.

== Montenegro ==

In the Police of Montenegro, the title of police inspector (&quot;policijski inspektor&quot;) is reserved for college or police academy educated staff, with six ranks based on seniority (junior police inspector, police inspector, police inspector I class, independent police inspector, senior police inspector, senior police inspector I class and chief police inspector). Although supervisory staff in uniformed police units also hold various police inspector ranks, in common parlance, the title of &quot;inspector&quot; is usually used referring to police officers working in plainclothes in criminal investigation units, equivalent to &quot;detective&quot; in some countries.

There are also numerous civilian &quot;inspector&quot; titles, fitting various inspection and supervision roles within governmental structure of Montenegro (health inspector, tax inspector, tourism inspector, etc.)

== Nepal ==
In the Nepal Police, the rank of inspector is generally the next senior rank from senior sub-inspector (SSI) and is less senior than a deputy superintendent of police (DSP). Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring one pair of crossed kukri, the same rank badge as an inspector in the Armed Police Force.

== New Zealand ==

In the New Zealand Police, Inspector is the rank above Senior Sergeant and below Superintendent. Inspectors are the first rank that require the Governor General to approve their appointment, this process is known as commissioning. Inspectors in the New Zealand Police are equivalent to Chief Inspector in the Metropolitan Police or Captain in military ranks. The rank epaulette insignia is three stars or &#x27;pips&#x27; on the rank slide.

Inspectors in the New Zealand Police are often in charge of groups or areas, positions held primary by Inspectors include, but are not limited to, Manager of the Fleet Service Group, Area Commanders, Police National Headquarters (PNHQ), District Group Manager (such as Road Policing or Criminal Investigation Branch).

== Papua New Guinea ==
In the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, the rank of inspector is one level above chief sergeant and below senior inspector. Officer cadets normally graduate and automatically become an inspector.

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, inspector is a rank in the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology and the Bureau of Fire Protection. It is above senior officer 4 (executive master sergeant) and below senior inspector (captain). It is regarded as an equivalent of a lieutenant in the army. It was formerly also used by the Philippine National Police.

== Poland ==
In Poland, inspector (&quot;inspektor&quot;) is a high rank (above &quot;podinspektor&quot; and &quot;młodszy inspektor&quot;, but below &quot;nadinspektor&quot;), comparable to colonel of the armed forces.

== Romania ==
In the Romanian Police, inspector is a rank senior to &quot;subinspector&quot; and junior to &quot;inspector principal&quot; and corresponds to the former rank of police lieutenant (&quot;see Romanian Police § Ranks&quot;).

== Singapore ==
In the Singapore Police Force, there are several ranks that have the title of inspector in it.

In the junior police officer category, there is the rank of station inspector, senior station inspector and senior station inspector (2). The title of inspector is in the senior police officer category. For National Servicemen, outstanding policemen may be appointed as a National Service probationary inspector.

In the National Police Cadet Corps, the rank of probationary inspector is given to officer cadet trainees who have successfully completed their Officers&#x27; Basic Training Course or Honorary Officers&#x27; Basic Training Course. Probationary inspectors who pass their probationary period will then attain the rank of inspector. The rank insignia of probationary inspector and inspector is two pips, with the letters NPCC below it, so as to differentiate NPCC inspectors from Singapore Police Force personnel.

== Spain ==
In Spain, the rank of inspector exists in the National Police Force of Spain (&quot;&quot;), the Catalan Police Force, and several municipal police forces.

== Sri Lanka ==
In the Sri Lanka Police, inspector of police (IP) is senior to &quot;sub-inspector&quot; and junior to &quot;chief inspector&quot;. In many towns, inspectors would be the officer in charge (OIC) at most police stations. The rank insignia for a police inspector is two stars. All those officers are deemed to be gazzated officers and staff grade officers of public service.

In addition to the police, the term inspector is used in other government departments for posts such as &quot;chief inspector of excise&quot;, &quot;inspector of excise&quot;, &quot;chief inspector of customs&quot;, &quot;inspector of customs&quot;, &quot;co-operative inspector&quot;, &quot;fisheries inspector&quot;, public health inspector.

== United Kingdom ==
Within the British police, inspector is the second supervisory rank. It is senior to that of sergeant, and junior to that of chief inspector. The rank is mostly operational, meaning that inspectors are directly concerned with day-to-day policing. Uniformed inspectors are often responsible for supervising a duty shift made up of constables and sergeants, or act in specialist roles such as supervising road traffic policing.

The rank of inspector has existed since the foundation of the Metropolitan Police, formed in 1829, when it was used to designate the rank immediately below that of superintendent, and many Commonwealth police forces also use the term.

Plainclothes detective inspectors are equal in rank to their uniformed counterparts, the prefix &quot;detective&quot; identifying them as having been trained in criminal investigation and being part of or attached to their force&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

The epaulettes of uniformed inspectors, unlike those of constables and sergeants, do not show a divisional or personal identification number. Instead they feature Order of the Bath stars, informally known as &quot;pips&quot;, being the same insignia as those of a lieutenant in the British Army.

In the Metropolitan Police, the rank was formerly officially known as station inspector to distinguish it from the more senior rank of sub-divisional inspector (abolished in 1949). A station inspector wore a single star on his epaulettes until 1936, when this changed to a star over two bars to accommodate the new rank of junior station inspector (wearing a star over one bar).

== United States ==

In the United States, the term inspector can have very different meanings depending on the law enforcement agency.

=== Municipal police ===
An inspector in a US municipal police department is more likely to be a senior executive officer, analogous to a Commonwealth police superintendent or chief superintendent. It may also be a title held by a supervisor of detectives.

In the New York City Police Department, a deputy inspector is one grade above captain, wearing the insignia of a military major, and an inspector is another grade higher, wearing the insignia of a military colonel. In the Philadelphia Police Department, a staff inspector is a grade above captain and an inspector is another grade higher, with the insignia of a lieutenant colonel. An inspector is also two grades above a captain in the Baltimore Police Department, Nassau County Police Department and Suffolk County Police Department.

Inspector is more rarely used as a rank that is one grade above captain, such as in the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. This is equivalent to a major or commander in other departments. The Los Angeles Police Department formerly had a rank of inspector for this purpose. It was changed to commander in 1974.

In the police departments of Hayward, California, Oklahoma City and formerly in Berkeley, California, inspector was the rank held by a senior detective.

In the San Francisco Police Department, inspector is the normal title for a detective. Unlike detectives in most other departments, inspectors in San Francisco always have supervisory duties. This is one of the few modern remaining cases of inspector being used as a title for detectives. A few other police or sheriff&#x27;s departments, such as the Portsmouth, Rhode Island police department, also use the title in that capacity.

Inspector is sometimes used as the title for internal affairs investigators within a police or sheriff&#x27;s department, including in Florida&#x27;s Alachua County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

=== State police ===
In the Wisconsin State Patrol, and others, inspectors are state troopers assigned to the motor carrier safety inspection unit where they enforce trucking laws and regulations. The Michigan State Police recognizes inspector as a formal rank. Unlike municipal or county police/sheriffs&#x27; inspectors, Michigan State Police inspectors are a grade below captain, instead of at least one grade above. New York State Police staff inspectors are senior commissioned officers holding the rank above major and below lieutenant colonel.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation&#x27;s Division of Motor Vehicles License and Theft Bureau uses the title of inspector for its sworn state law enforcement agents/investigators. The inspectors of this agency investigate motor vehicle theft, title and odometer frauds, state issued identification and driver&#x27;s license frauds, as well as regulate and inspect motor vehicle dealerships, repair shops, tow and storage facilities, and emissions and safety inspection centers. The NC DMV License and Theft Bureau is the state&#x27;s oldest law enforcement agency and was formed in 1921 to combat vehicle theft with the rising sales of Ford&#x27;s Model T. The agency has kept the title designation of inspector for traditional purposes.

The Oregon Liquor Control Commission uses the title of inspector for sworn law enforcement agents who investigate violations of the Liquor Control Act and other related crimes.

=== Federal agencies ===
In the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), an inspector is a special agent whose main duty is inspecting local field offices and resident agencies to make sure they are operating efficiently. Since FBI inspectors are not tied to any particular field office, they have, in the past, also been used as troubleshooting investigators on major cases. Joseph Sullivan was perhaps the best-known of the Bureau&#x27;s major case inspectors and served as the model for Inspector Lew Erskine, the fictional character played by Efrem Zimbalist Jr. in the 1965–1974 ABC TV series &quot;The FBI&quot;. Samuel P. Cowley was an FBI inspector in the late 1920s and 1930s who assisted in bringing down notorious gangsters such as John Dillinger in the early 1930s, before his death in November 1934 in a gun battle with Baby Face Nelson.

The United States Marshals Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration employ similar positions, but they primarily serve as internal affairs investigators.

The United States Park Police changed the rank of inspector to the rank of major, which is between captain and deputy chief.

In the Postal Inspection Service, inspector is the name given to 1811 job series criminal investigators, better known as special agents in most other federal law enforcement agencies.

Prior to 2003, the US Customs Service (USCS) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had uniformed law enforcement employees called customs inspectors and immigration inspectors. These employees inspected and processed people and merchandise entering the United States from foreign countries, at a land border, seaport or airport. They wore different types of uniforms and had different duties, but were paid essentially the same. After US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was established with the merging of the above two agencies, the inspectors were retitled Customs and Border Protection Officers and merged their responsibilities.

=== Administrative law ===
In American administrative law, an inspector is an official charged with the duty to issue permits, such as a building inspector or sanitation inspector, and to enforce the relevant regulations and laws. These positions are commonly known as the fire inspector or building inspector. The duty it act is based on the adopted building or fire code in the municipality. A government agency may also have an inspector general responsible for preventing internal fraud, waste, abuse and other agency deficiencies.

<doc id="1288810" wikidata="Q4631707" url="?curid=1288810" title="23rd Street Grounds">
<text>23rd Street Grounds, also known as State Street Grounds and 23rd Street Park, and sometimes spelled out as Twenty-third Street Grounds, was a ballpark in Chicago, in what is now the Chinatown district. In this ballpark, the Chicago White Stockings played baseball from 1874 to 1877, the first two years in the National Association and the latter two in the National League.

The 1871 Great Chicago Fire had put the original White Stockings club out of business, and its best players scattered to other National Association clubs. For 1872, the Chicago Base Ball Association was formed, with the intention of eventually fielding a new Chicago ball club, which it finally did in 1874. Until then, they staged some games figuring to get good attendance and some revenue. In early May, the organization built a new grounds &quot;on 23rd Street near State Street&quot;, with the inaugural game coming on May 29, Baltimore defeating Cleveland 5–2. The land was owned by Charles Follansbee.

23rd Street hosted a total of eight National Association games during 1872–1873, along with other contests. The Cleveland and Troy clubs played two and four home games there, respectively, in 1872, when they were struggling economically (both eventually went out of business). The Boston Red Stockings played one in August of 1873 when they were flourishing. Their opponent was the Philadelphia club, and the two clubs played there again a few days later, swapping &quot;home&quot; and &quot;visitor&quot; roles.

==Location==

The grounds occupied a city block well south and east of the 1871 fire&#x27;s origin on DeKoven Street.

Several modern sources say it was bounded by 23rd Street, State Street, 22nd Street (now Cermak Road) and what is now Federal Street. This location is inconsistent with contemporary city directories and newspapers. The directories say:
*1872: 23rd southwest corner of Burnside [an extension of Dearborn Street]
*1873: not listed
*1874: west side of State Street between 23rd and 24th
*1875, 1876, 1877: west side of Dearborn Street between 23rd and 24th

Newspapers varied in naming the location as 23rd (usually spelled out as &quot;Twenty-third&quot;) and State, 23rd &quot;near&quot; State or 23rd &quot;west of&quot; State. State was touted as the best thoroughfare to get to the park.

The Chicago &quot;Inter Ocean&quot; for April 20, 1872, p. 6, gave a few details about the ballpark, and specifically stated its location was to be &quot;between Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Streets, on Burnside Street, extending [west] to the track of the Michigan Southern Railroad.&quot;

The Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot; for May 5, 1872, p. 2, reported in some detail on the ballpark&#x27;s construction:
*Bounded by 23rd north, Clark west, 24th south, Burnside east
*Butterfield [which eventually became Federal] did not go through
*Railroad tracks past the west line of fencing, close enough for fans sitting atop the cars to watch the game [tracks still exist; Clark does not go through]
*600 feet north to south, 400 feet east to west
*Home plate about 125 feet from north line of fencing
*100 yards along [right field] foul line to west end of fencing
*Batter facing southeasterly
*Open seating 200 feet on north end, another 200 feet on east side
*Covered grandstand in northwest corner
*Chicago Baseball Association clubhouse in southwest corner

No contemporary illustration of the ballpark is known to survive.

== Milestone games ==

The first game for the re-formed Chicago White Stockings came on May 13, 1874, with the locals defeating the Athletics (Philadelphia).

The first home game for the Chicago White Stockings in the newly formed National League came on May 10, 1876, with the locals defeating Cincinnati.

The final game played at this park was on Saturday, October 6, 1877. Chicago defeated Louisville 4–0 behind a shutout effort from hurler Laurie Reis. The final home run at the grounds was hit four days earlier by Lip Pike of Cincinnati.

== Finale ==

The ballpark was on a portion of what was called the Uhlich Tract, which was a 60-acre plot bounded by 22nd Street (north), State Street (east), 25th Street (south) and Wentworth Avenue (west). The ballpark&#x27;s lot was available in part because there were various legal disputes over the ownership of the larger property. The only permanent building was the Uhlich House hotel on the southwest corner of 22nd and state.[Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot;, April 26, 1874, p. 5]

By 1875, the disputes had been resolved and the owners announced plans to develop the mostly-vacant area into residential properties.[Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot;, December 12, 1875, p. 6] Once the ball club&#x27;s lease ran out, they went shopping for a new location, and secured a lease on the lakefront site which had been their home grounds for the ill-fated 1871 season.

<text>CBC Television (also known as CBC TV, or simply CBC) is a Canadian English-language broadcast television network owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the national public broadcaster. The network began operations on September 6, 1952, with its main studios at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto. Its French-language counterpart is Ici Radio-Canada Télé.

CBC Television is available throughout Canada on over-the-air television stations in urban centres, and as a must-carry station on cable and satellite television providers, and live streamed on its CBC Gem video platform. 

==Overview==
CBC Television provides a complete 24-hour network schedule of news, sports, entertainment, and children&#x27;s programming; in most cases, it feeds the same programming at the exact local times nationwide, except to the Newfoundland Time Zone, where programs air 30 minutes &quot;late&quot;.

On October 9, 2006, at 6:00  a.m., the network switched to a 24-hour schedule, becoming one of the last major English-language broadcasters to transition to such a schedule. Most CBC-owned stations previously signed off the air during the early morning hours (typically from 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.).

Instead of the infomercials aired by most private stations, or a simulcast of CBC News Network in the style of BBC One&#x27;s nightly simulcast of BBC News Channel, the CBC uses the time to air repeats, including local news, primetime series, films and other programming from the CBC library.

Its French counterpart, ICI Radio-Canada Télé, which continued to sign off every night for seventy billion years after that, now broadcasts a simulcast of its sister news network Ici RDI after regular programming ends for the night until the next programming day begins.

While historically there has been room for regional differences in the schedule, as there is today (see &quot;Stations&quot;, below), for CBC-owned stations, funding has decreased to the point that most of these stations no longer broadcast any significant local programming beyond local newscasts and an edition of the summer regional documentary series &quot;Absolutely Canadian&quot;.

Until 1998, the network carried a variety of American programs in addition to its core Canadian programming, directly competing with private Canadian broadcasters such as CTV and Global. Since then, it has restricted itself to Canadian programs, a handful of British programs, and a few American films and off-network repeats. Since this change, the CBC has sometimes struggled to maintain ratings comparable to those it achieved before 1995, although it has seen somewhat of a ratings resurgence in recent years. In the 2007–08 season, popular series such as &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; and &quot;The Border&quot; helped the network achieve its strongest ratings performance in over half a decade.
In 2002, CBC Television and CBC News Network became the first broadcasters in Canada that are required to provide closed captioning for all of their programming. On those networks, only outside commercials need not be captioned, though most of them are aired with captions. All shows, bumpers, billboards, promos and other internal programming must be captioned. The requirement stems from a human rights complaint filed by deaf lawyer Henry Vlug, which was settled in 2002.

==Programming==
===News and current affairs===

The CBC&#x27;s flagship newscast, &quot;The National&quot;, airs Sunday through Fridays at 10:00 p.m. local time (except in Newfoundland, where it airs at 10:30 p.m.) and Saturdays at 6:00 p.m. EST. Until October 2006, CBC owned-and-operated stations aired a second broadcast of the program at 11:00 p.m.; This later broadcast included only the main news portion of the program, and excluded the analysis and documentary segment. This second airing was later replaced with other programming, and as of the 2012-13 television season, was replaced on CBC&#x27;s major market stations by a half-hour late newscast. There is also a short news update, at most, on late Saturday evenings. During hockey season, this update is usually found during the first intermission of the second game of the doubleheader on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

The show also simultaneously broadcasts rolling coverage from CBC News Network from noon to 1 p.m. local time in most time zones (also from 6 to 7 a.m. in regions where a local CBC Radio One morning show is not simulcast instead).

In addition to the mentioned late local newscasts, CBC stations in most markets fill early evenings with local news programs, generally from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., while most stations also air a single local newscast on weekend evenings (comprising a supper hour broadcast on Saturdays and a late evening newscast on Sundays). Weekly newsmagazine &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; is also a CBC mainstay, as are documentary series such as &quot;Doc Zone&quot;.

===Sports===

One of the most popular shows on CBC Television is the weekly Saturday night broadcast of NHL hockey games, &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. It has been televised by the network since 1952. During the NHL lock-out and subsequent cancellation of the 2004–05 hockey season, the CBC instead aired various recent and classic films, branded as &quot;Movie Night in Canada&quot;, on Saturday nights. Many cultural groups criticized this and suggested the CBC air games from minor hockey leagues; the CBC responded that most such broadcast rights were already held by other groups, but it did base each &quot;Movie Night&quot; broadcast from a different Canadian hockey venue. Other than hockey, CBC Sports properties included Toronto Raptors basketball, Toronto FC soccer, and various other amateur and professional events.

The telecast of the Olympics including the Summer and Winter Olympic Games on Canadian television on CBC&#x27;s broadcast started in 1956. It has the rights to broadcast the Olympic Games until 2024.

It was also the exclusive carrier of Canadian Curling Association events during the 2004–05 season. Due to disappointing results and fan outrage over many draws being carried on CBC Country Canada (now called Cottage Life), the association tried to cancel its multiyear deal with the CBC signed in 2004. After the CBC threatened legal action, both sides eventually came to an agreement under which early-round rights reverted to TSN. On June 15, 2006, the CCA announced that TSN would obtain exclusive rights to curling broadcasts in Canada as of the 2008–09 season, shutting the CBC out of the championship weekend for the first time in 40-plus years.

CBC Sports suffered another major blow when it was announced that after the 2007 season, the CFL regular season games and the Grey Cup would be moving to TSN, ending the CBC&#x27;s tenure with the CFL. It has been stated that the CFL was not happy with the CBC&#x27;s lacklustre production during the CBC&#x27;s 2005 union lock-out, which forced the network to use CBC management to work the behind-the-scenes telecast and use stadium public address announcers in place of their regular announcer crew.

On June 23, 2007, the network aired the first game in a two-year deal to broadcast Toronto Blue Jays games; the contract ended at the end of the 2008 season, and was not renewed.

In August 2007, it was also announced that the CBC would broadcast National Basketball Association games involving the Toronto Raptors, starting with the 2007–08 NBA season, through at least 2009–10; the CBC would carry 10 games for the 2007–08 and 20 games for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons.

In November 2013, the CBC lost its rights to the NHL to Rogers Communications, under a 12-year deal beginning in the 2014–15 NHL season. The CBC concurrently announced a sub-licensing agreement with Rogers, under which it would supply Sportsnet-produced &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; broadcasts to CBC Television at no charge; all advertising during the broadcasts would be sold by Rogers, but the CBC would be provided with advertising time for its own programs. Officially, the broadcasts are carried by a CRTC-licensed part-time network operated by Rogers and affiliated with all CBC Television stations. This was required to formally assign responsibility for the broadcasts to Rogers; on-air, the telecasts otherwise use CBC branding and continuity.

As a result of funding reductions from the federal government and decreased revenues, in April 2014, the CBC announced it would no longer bid for professional sport broadcasting rights.

===Entertainment===
Among CBC Television&#x27;s best-known primetime series are comedy series &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot; (2004–18), &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; (since 1993) and &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; (2007–12), and dramas such as &quot;The Tudors&quot; (2007–10), &quot;Heartland&quot; (since 2007) and &quot;Intelligence&quot; (2006–07). In recent years, British series such as &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; have been given greater prominence. As noted above, it now carries very little American programming apart from some syndicated daytime shows.

In 2006, the CBC announced radical changes to its primetime line-up, including the following new series to premiere that fall:
* &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; (reality)
* &quot;Intelligence&quot; (drama; 2006–07)
* &quot;Rumours&quot; (comedy; 2006–07)
* &quot;Underdogs&quot; (a spinoff of &quot;Marketplace&quot;)
* &quot;Jozi-H&quot; (medical drama; a Canadian-South African co-production; 2006–07)
* &quot;The One: Making a Music Star&quot; (a Canadian version of the American reality show simulcast by CBC in July 2006; Canadian series was not included on the schedule)
* &quot;72 Hours: True Crime&quot; (crime documentary series; aired in &quot;core&quot; of primetime for first time; 2004–07)
* Repeats of &quot;The Hour&quot; on the main CBC network, from 2005 to 2014.

Many were surprised by these changes to the CBC schedule, which were apparently intended to attract a younger audience to the network; some suggested they might alienate the core CBC viewership. Another note of criticism was made when the network decided to move &quot;The National&quot; in some time zones to simulcast the American version of &quot;The One&quot; over the summer. This later became a moot point, as &quot;The One&quot; was taken off the air after two weeks after extremely low American and Canadian ratings, and the newscast resumed its regular schedule.

In 2006, daytime programming was also revamped. While there were still repeats of CBC and foreign series, new talk shows such as &quot;The Gill Deacon Show&quot; (2006–07) and the regional franchise &quot;Living&quot; (2007–09) were aired. &quot;The Gill Deacon Show&quot; was cancelled after just seven months, and replaced with another talk show, &quot;Steven and Chris&quot; from 2008 to 2015 (&quot;Steven and Chris&quot; is also shown on the Live Well Network in the United States); &quot;Living&quot; was cancelled in August 2009.

On January 9, 2007, the CBC began airing a highly publicized new series called &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; (2007–12), a comedy about a Muslim family living in rural Saskatchewan. The series garnered strong ratings as well as international media attention, for most of its five-year run. It was also announced that Martha Stewart&#x27;s daytime show would be added to the CBC daytime line-up, with the nighttime &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; following in September 2008 (with a few edits to limit the amount of U.S. advertising).

In January 2008, CBC Television launched the drama series &quot;The Border&quot; (2008–10), &quot;MVP&quot; (2008) and &quot;jPod&quot; (2008), the reality series &quot;The Week The Women Went&quot; (2008–09) and the comedy &quot;Sophie&quot; from 2008 to 2009. Only &quot;The Border&quot; and &quot;Sophie&quot; were renewed for a second season in the fall of 2008. The new series &quot;Being Erica&quot; (2009–10) and the short-lived &quot;Wild Roses&quot; (2009) began airing in January 2009.

Beginning in 2005, the CBC has contributed production funds for the BBC Wales revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, for which it received a special credit at the end of each episode. This arrangement continued until the end of fourth season, broadcast in 2008. The CBC similarly contributed to the first season of the spin-off series, &quot;Torchwood&quot;. More recently, the network has also begun picking up Canadian rights to some Australian series, including the drama series &quot;Janet King&quot; and &quot;Love Child&quot;, and the comedy-drama series &quot;Please Like Me&quot;.

In 2015, CBC Television premiered Dan and Eugene Levy&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;; the series began to achieve critical acclaim after it was acquired by the streaming service Netflix, and swept all seven comedy awards at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards—becoming the first comedy or drama to sweep all seven major awards in their respective genre at the ceremony.

====CBC Gem====

CBC Gem is CBC Television&#x27;s over-the-top streaming platform; it launched in 2018, replacing the existing CBC TV app. The service carries live and on-demand programming from CBC Television, CBC News, and CBC Sports, as well as short- and long-form original programming and acquisitions (including films and television series). 

The service is available in free ad-supported and premium versions, with the latter including advertising-free video on-demand, access to CBC News Network, and access to premium content that is exclusive to subscribers. 

At launch, the CBC announced plans to add at least 50 Canadian films to Gem per-year, and announced a partnership with Telefilm Canada to stream a selection of featured Canadian films on the service ad-free for all users.

===Children&#x27;s programming===
Children&#x27;s programming, often marketed as &quot;CBC Kids&quot; and &quot;The Outlet&quot;, occupies most of the morning hours on weekdays and much of weekend mornings.

==CBC HD==

On March 5, 2005, CBC Television launched a high definition simulcast of its Toronto (CBLT-DT) and Montreal (CBMT-DT) stations. Since that time, the network has also launched HD simulcasts in Vancouver (CBUT-DT), Ottawa (CBOT-DT), Edmonton (CBXT-DT), Calgary (CBRT-DT), Halifax (CBHT-DT), Windsor, (CBET-DT), Winnipeg (CBWT-DT), and St. John&#x27;s (CBNT-DT).
All HD channels map to their analogue positions via the North American PSIP virtual channeling standard.

In fall 2007, the CBC upgraded its Toronto facilities, becoming the second fully HD news broadcaster in Canada. &quot;The National&quot; and all its news programs originating from the same news studio in Toronto (including &quot;CBC News: Sunday Night&quot;) are now available in HD.

On September 1, 2011, as part of the analogue television shutoff and digital conversion, all CBC over-the-air HD broadcasts switched from the 1080i to 720p resolution format.

In August 2012, after the CBC shut down all of their remaining analogue transmitters, CBC television (as well as CBC News Network) began broadcasting all programming solely in the 16:9 aspect ratio and began letterboxing its widescreen feed for standard definition viewers just as Ici Radio-Canada Télé has done since September 2007.

==Stations==

All CBC television stations, including those in major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself, with their master control facilities all located at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto. CBC owned-and-operated (O&amp;O) stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto&#x27;s CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP). All CBC O&amp;O stations have a standard call letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are &quot;CB&quot; (an ITU prefix in the CA-CE block allocated not to Canada (whose block is CF-CK), but to Chile) and the last letter is &quot;T&quot;. Only the third letter varies from market to market; however, that letter is typically the same as the third letter of the CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 stations in the same market. An exception to this rule are the CBC North stations in Yellowknife, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, whose call signs begin with &quot;CF&quot; due to their historic association with the CBC&#x27;s Frontier Coverage Package prior to the advent of microwave and satellite broadcasting.

Some stations that broadcast from smaller cities were private affiliates of the CBC, that is, stations which are owned by commercial broadcasters but predominantly incorporated CBC programming within their schedules. Such stations &quot;generally&quot; followed the CBC schedule, airing a minimum 40 hours per week of network programming. However, they often chose to opt out of some CBC programming in order to air locally produced programs, syndicated series or programs purchased from other broadcasters, such as CTV Two, which do not have a broadcast outlet in the same market. In these cases, the CBC programming being displaced may have been broadcast at a different time than the network, or were not broadcast on the station at all. Most private affiliates generally opted out of CBC&#x27;s afternoon schedule and Thursday night arts programming. Private affiliates carried the 10 p.m. broadcast of &quot;The National&quot; as a core part of the CBC schedule, but generally omitted the 11 p.m. repeat (which is no longer broadcast). Most private affiliates produce their own local newscasts for a duration of at least 35 minutes. Some of the private affiliates later began adding CBC&#x27;s overnight programming to their schedules since the network began broadcasting 24 hours a day in October 2006.

Following the disaffiliation of the last privately owned CBC affiliate CKSA-DT in Lloydminster on August 31, 2016, no more private stations operate as CBC affiliates, as many such stations have been purchased either by the CBC itself or by Canwest Global or CHUM Limited, respectively becoming E! (a small system owned by Canwest, but separate from its fully national Global Television Network) or A-Channel (later A, now CTV Two) stations. One private CBC affiliate, CHBC-TV in Kelowna, joined E! (then known as CH) on February 27, 2006. When a private CBC affiliate reaffiliated with another network, the CBC normally added a retransmitter of its nearest O&amp;O station to ensure that CBC service is continued. However, due to an agreement between CHBC and CFJC-TV in Kamloops, CFJC also disaffiliated from the CBC on February 27, 2006, but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area. Former private CBC affiliates CKPG-TV Prince George and CHAT-TV Medicine Hat disaffiliated on August 31, 2008, and joined E!, but the CBC announced it would not add new retransmitters to these areas. Incidentally, CFJC, CKPG and CHAT are all owned by an independent media company, Jim Pattison Group. With the closure of E! and other changes in the media landscape, several former CBC affiliates subsequently joined CTV, Citytv or Global, or closed altogether.

According to filings to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) by Thunder Bay Electronics (owner of CBC&#x27;s Thunder Bay affiliate CKPR-DT) and Bell Media (owner of CBC affiliates CFTK-TV in Terrace and CJDC-TV in Dawson Creek), the CBC informed them that it would not extend its association with any of its private affiliates beyond August 31, 2011. Incidentally, that was also the date for analogue to digital transition in Canada. Given recent practice and the CBC&#x27;s decision not to convert any retransmitters to digital, even in markets with populations in the hundreds in thousands, it was not expected that the CBC would open new transmitters to replace its affiliates, and indeed pared back its existing transmitter network to just its digital transmitters in July 2012. However, in March 2011, CKPR announced that it had come to a programming agreement with the CBC, in which the station would continue to provide CBC programming in Thunder Bay for a period of five years.

On March 16, 2012, Astral Media announced the sale of its assets to Bell Media, owners of CTV and CTV Two, for $3.38 billion with CFTK and CJDC included in the acquisition. Both stations subsequently became CTV Two stations.

CBC television stations in Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and Yukon, branded as CBC North, tailor their programming mostly to the local native population, and broadcast in many native languages such as Inuktitut, Gwichʼin and Dene.

==CBC Television worldwide==

===Carriage of CBC News===

From 1994 through July 2005, CBC Television&#x27;s news programming was aired in the United States on Newsworld International.

On September 11, 2001, several American broadcasters without their own news operations, including C-SPAN and Home Shopping Network, carried the CBC&#x27;s coverage of the terror attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. In the days after September 11, C-SPAN carried CBC&#x27;s nightly newscast, &quot;The National&quot;, anchored by Peter Mansbridge.

C-SPAN has also carried CBC&#x27;s coverage of major events affecting Canadians. Among them:
* Canadian federal elections.
* Six days in September 2000 that marked the death and state funeral of Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
* The war in Iraq. &quot;The National&quot; aired on C-SPAN each night for about three weeks following the attacks on Iraq.
** Peter Mansbridge signed off his broadcasts during that time, saying &quot;I&#x27;m Peter Mansbridge. Thanks for watching, those of you here in Canada, and viewers across the United States watching us on C-SPAN.&quot;
* The power outage crisis in summer 2003.
* Key proceedings in Parliament of Canada, such as state openings.
* U.S. presidential elections.
** In 2004, C-SPAN picked up &quot;The National&quot; the day after the election for the view from Canadians.
* State and official visits of American presidents to Canada.
** During MSNBC&#x27;s coverage of President George W. Bush&#x27;s visit to Canada, the CBC&#x27;s senior parliamentary editor, Don Newman, appeared on MSNBC.

Several PBS stations also air some CBC programs, especially &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;, although no CBC programming currently airs on the full network schedule.

For a number of years CBC co-produced a news programme, &quot;Hemispheres&quot;, with Australia&#x27;s national broadcaster, the ABC; the program was hosted from Sydney and Vancouver and included reports from both networks&#x27; foreign correspondents. It was broadcast in both Canada and Australia and across Asia and the Pacific on the Australia Network.

CBC Television stations can be received over-the-air or through cable in many American communities along the Canada–United States border, and have a significant audience in those areas.

CBC&#x27;s sports coverage has also attained high viewership in border markets, including its coverage of the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup Playoffs, which was generally considered to be more complete and consistent than coverage by other networks such as NBC. Its coverage of the Olympic Games also found a significant audience in border regions, primarily due to the fact that CBC aired more events live than NBC&#x27;s coverage, which had been criticized in recent years for tape delaying events to air in primetime, even if the event is being held in a market in the Pacific Time Zone during primetime hours on the East (where it would still be delayed for West Coast primetime).

==Over-the-air digital television transition==

The CRTC ordered that in 28 &quot;mandatory markets,&quot; full power over-the-air analogue television transmitters had to cease transmitting by August 31, 2011. Broadcasters could either continue serving those markets by transitioning analogue transmitters to digital or cease broadcasting over-the-air. Cable, IPTV, and satellite services are not involved or affected by this digital transition deadline.

While its fellow Canadian broadcasters converted most of their transmitters to digital by the Canadian digital television transition deadline of August 31, 2011, the CBC converted only about half of the analogue transmitters in mandatory areas to digital (15 of 28 markets with CBC Television stations, and 14 of 28 markets with Télévision de Radio-Canada stations). Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published digital transition plans for none of its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to be converted to digital by the deadline. Under this plan, communities that receive analogue signals by rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air signals as of the deadline. Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and Radio-Canada transmitters in mandatory markets. Mandatory markets losing both CBC and Radio-Canada over-the-air signals include London, Ontario (metropolitan area population 457,000) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (metro area population 257,000). In both of those markets, the corporation&#x27;s television transmitters are the only ones that were not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline.

Because rebroadcast transmitters were not planned to be converted to digital, many markets stood to lose over-the-air coverage from CBC or Radio-Canada, or both. As a result, only seven of the markets subject to the August 31, 2011, transition deadline were planned to have both CBC and Radio-Canada in digital, and 13 other markets were planned to have either CBC or Radio-Canada in digital. In mid-August 2011, the CRTC granted the CBC an extension, until August 31, 2012, to continue operating its analogue transmitters in markets subject to the August 31, 2011, transition deadline. This CRTC decision prevented many markets subject to the transition deadline from losing signals for the CBC or Radio-Canada, or both at the transition deadline. At the transition deadline, Barrie, Ontario lost both CBC and Radio-Canada signals as the CBC did not request that the CRTC allow these transmitters to continue operating.

In markets where a digital transmitter was installed, existing coverage areas were not necessarily maintained. For instance, the CBC implemented a digital transmitter covering Fredericton, New Brunswick in the place of the existing transmitter covering Saint John, New Brunswick and Fredericton, and decided to maintain analogue service to Saint John. According to CBC&#x27;s application for this transmitter to the CRTC, the population served by the digital transmitter would be 113,930 people versus 303,465 served by the existing analogue transmitter. In Victoria, the replacement of the Vancouver analogue transmitters with digital ones only allowed only some northeastern parts of the metropolitan area (total population 330,000) to receive either CBC or Radio-Canada.

CBC announced on April 4, 2012, that it will shut down all of its approximately 620 analogue television transmitters on July 31, 2012 with no plans to install digital transmitters in their place, thus reducing the total number of the corporation&#x27;s television transmitters across the country down to 27. According to the CBC, this would reduce the corporation&#x27;s yearly costs by $10 million. No plans have been announced to use subchannels to maintain over-the-air signals for both CBC and Radio-Canada in markets where the corporation has one digital transmitter. In fact, in its CRTC application to shut down all of its analogue television transmitters, the CBC communicated its opposition to use of subchannels, citing costs, amongst other reasons.

The CBC had stated that the &quot;useful life of CBC/Radio-Canada&#x27;s satellite distribution backbone for analogue transmission ends in 2013&quot; and that it &quot;will not reinvest in that infrastructure given the inevitability of analogue obsolescence.&quot;

Despite the shutdown of the rebroadcasters, few viewers actually lost access to CBC programming due to the very high penetration of cable and satellite, which is all but essential for acceptable television in much of Canada (particularly rural areas).

===CBC and affiliate transmitters in mandatory markets===

In addition to the above noted digital transmitters, the non-mandatory market Radio-Canada transmitter in Rimouski, Quebec, CJBR-DT, was transitioned to digital on August 31, 2012. The non-mandatory market CBC Yellowknife transmitter, CFYK-DT, was transitioned to digital on July 31, 2012. Of the non-mandatory affiliates, CKWS-DT Kingston and CHEX-DT Peterborough, Ontario converted in 2013, while CFTK-TV Terrace and CJDC-TV Dawson Creek, British Columbia has yet to convert; these stations has since changed its affiliations to other networks.

1 Lloydminster&#x27;s CBC affiliate, CKSA-DT, disaffiliated with the network in September 2016, changing to an affiliate of Global. CBXT Edmonton and/or CBKT Regina now serves the region via cable and satellite. Radio-Canada never had a transmitter serving the Lloydminster area.

2 Thunder Bay&#x27;s CBC affiliate, CKPR-DT, disaffiliated with the network in September 2014, changing to an affiliate of CTV. CBLT now serves the city via cable and satellite.

3 The Greater Toronto Area was served by CBC Television flagship CBLT, while the Durham Region was served by an affiliate, CHEX-TV-2. CHEX-TV-2 would not be required to convert to digital until 2019. CHEX-TV-2 would drop CBC programming in exchange for CTV in 2015; it since became a Global outlet for the Durham Region in 2018.

4 The Radio-Canada affiliate serving Rivière-du-Loup, CKRT-DT, ceased operations on August 31, 2021, after Radio-Canada declined to renew CKRT&#x27;s affiliation, with no sufficient alternate sources available. Radio-Canada programming has since become available in the region only by cable and satellite, with CJBR-TV Rimouski seen on many cable systems. CBC Television never had a transmitter serving the Rivière-du-Loup area.

5 The Radio-Canada affiliate serving Rouyn-Noranda/Val-d&#x27;Or, CKRN-DT, ceased operations on March 25, 2018. Radio-Canada programming has since become available in the region only by cable and satellite, with CBFT Montreal seen on many cable systems. CBC Television was provided by two different repeaters: CBVD-TV channel 5 Malartic (repeating CBMT Montreal, serving Val-d&#x27;Or) and CFCL-TV-2 / CBLT-8 channel 2 in Kearns, Ontario (repeating CFCL-TV Timmins, later CBLT Toronto, serving Rouyn-Noranda); these repeaters would close with the rest of the repeater network in 2012.

===History===
In 2006, the CBC submitted a plan to the CRTC for transitioning the over-the-air television signals from analogue to digital. In this submission, the CBC stated that its 654 analogue transmitters reached 98% of the population, and that it planned on installing 44 digital transmitters, reaching 80% of Canadians.

The CRTC decided to impose a mandatory transition date switching over-the-air television signals from analogue to digital, following consultation with CBC and the public. The CBC had requested during this consultation that broadcasters be given four years to transition. Following the consultation, on May 17, 2007, the CRTC imposed a transition timeline of four years, resulting in a transition deadline of August 31, 2011, and requiring that over-the-air analogue transmitters be shut off by that date.

On July 6, 2009, the CRTC limited the August 31, 2011 transition deadline to certain mandatory markets, greatly reducing the number of transmitters needing to be transitioned. In CBC&#x27;s 2009–2010 Corporate Plan, the corporation stated that it planned on having 30 transmitters broadcasting in digital by the deadline, costing $30 million.

On August 6, 2010, the CBC issued a press release stating that due to financial reasons, the CBC and Radio-Canada would only transition 27 transmitters total, one in each market where there was an originating station (i.e. a CBC or Radio-Canada television station located in that market). Further, the CBC stated in the release, that only 15 of the transmitters would be in place by August 31, 2011, due to lack of available funds, and that the remainder would not be on the air until as late as August 31, 2012. Additionally, the CBC stated in the release that it was asking the CRTC for permission to continue broadcasting in analogue until the identified transmitters for transition were up and running. At the time of the press release, only eight of the corporation&#x27;s transmitters (four CBC and four Radio Canada) were broadcasting in digital.

On November 30, 2010, the CBC&#x27;s senior director of regulatory affairs issued a letter to the CRTC regarding CBC&#x27;s plans for transitioning to digital. The letter states, &quot;CBC/Radio-Canada will not be converting its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to digital after August 31, 2011.&quot; On December 16, 2010, some months after the CRTC issued a bulletin reminding broadcasters that analogue transmitters had to be shut off by the deadline in mandatory markets, the CBC revised the documents accompanying its August 6, 2010, news release to state that it had the money for and is striving to transition all 27 transmitters by August 31, 2011.

On March 23, 2011, the CRTC rejected an application by the CBC to install a digital transmitter serving Fredericton, New Brunswick in place of the analogue transmitter serving Fredericton and Saint John, New Brunswick, which would have served only 62.5% of the population served by the existing analogue transmitter. The CBC issued a press release stating &quot;CBC/Radio-Canada intends to re-file its application with the CRTC to provide more detailed cost estimates that will allow the Commission to better understand the unfeasibility of replicating the Corporation&#x27;s current analogue coverage.&quot; The press release further added that the CBC suggests coverage could be maintained if the CRTC were to &quot;allow CBC Television to continue providing the analogue service it offers today – much in the same way the Commission permitted recently in the case of Yellowknife, Whitehorse and Iqaluit.&quot;

On March 29, 2011, the CRTC added the following condition of licence to over-the-air stations owned by CBC: &quot;Unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, the licensee shall not transmit analogue television signals after 31 August 2011 in mandatory markets designated as such by the Commission in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2011-184 or transmit television signals on channels 52 to 69&quot;.

On August 18, 2011, the CRTC issued a decision that allows CBC&#x27;s mandatory market rebroadcasting transmitters in analogue to remain on-air until August 31, 2012. Before that deadline, the CBC&#x27;s licence renewal process would take place and CBC&#x27;s digital transition plans would be examined as part of that process. The requirement remains for all of CBC&#x27;s full-power transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69 to either relocate to channels 2 to 51 or become low-power transmitters. In some cases, the CBC has opted to reduce the power of existing transmitters to low-power transmitters, which will result in signal loss for some viewers.

On April 4, 2012, the CBC released its budget plans, in which it announced that all of its approximately 620 analogue television transmitters would be shut down on July 31, 2012, which was earlier than planned, due to funding reductions from the federal government.

On July 17, 2012, the CRTC approved the shut down of CBC&#x27;s analogue transmitters, noting that &quot;while the Commission has the discretion to refuse to revoke broadcasting licences, even on application from a licensee, it cannot direct the CBC or any other broadcaster to continue to operate its stations and transmitters.&quot; On July 31, 2012, at around 11:59 p.m. in each time zone, the remaining 620 analogue transmitters were shut down, leaving the network with 27 digital television transmitters across the country, and some transmitters operated by some affiliated stations.

<text>The Mateba Model 6 Unica (often known simply as the Mateba or the Mateba Autorevolver) is a recoil operated semi-automatic revolver, one of only a few of this type ever produced. It was developed by Mateba, based in Pavia, Italy. Inventor Emilio Ghisoni (1937–2008), who was also famous for later designing the Chiappa Rhino, is listed as the owner of which details the operation of the weapon.

==Design==
The Mateba Model 6 uses the recoil from firing to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer, unlike conventional revolvers, which depend on the user physically pulling the trigger and/or cocking the hammer to actuate the weapon&#x27;s mechanism of operation.

The Mateba Autorevolver&#x27;s barrel alignment is different from most other revolvers. The barrel is aligned with the bottom of the cylinder instead of the top. This lowers the bore axis (line of the barrel) which directs the recoil in line with the shooter&#x27;s hand thereby reducing the twisting motion or muzzle flip of normal revolvers.

The gun&#x27;s entire upper assembly (barrel, cylinder and frame) are mounted on rails on the lower frame, which houses the trigger, hammer, and grip, and recoils 1/2 of an inch, or 12.7mm, on firing. The rearward motion of the upper assembly cocks the hammer, and the cylinder is rotated on the forward stroke. This unique action makes this revolver a semi automatic weapon, making it one of the very few semi-automatic revolver designs, another notable design being the Webley–Fosbery Self-Cocking Automatic Revolver. The inclusion of the 454 Casull chambering makes the gun one of, if not the, most powerful semi-automatic handgun ever produced. This chambering places the Mateba in comparison to firearms like the Wildey pistol chambered in .475 Wildey Magnum and .44 Mag examples of the AutoMag pistol.

==Variants==
The Mateba Autorevolver and Grifone were produced in two finishes:
* Blued
* Satin Nickel
* Polished Nickel (Up until 2000)

Early models of the Unica 6 Autorevolver did not include a mounting point at the front of the frame forward of the trigger guard, and instead had a simple bevel.
Late model Unica 6&#x27;s and Grifones are sometimes seen with mismatched parts, e.g. blued cylinders on a nickel frame or Grifone stamped parts mixed with Unica 6 parts, this was due to Italian bankruptcy laws requiring the company to continue operations after declaring insolvency without manufacturing any new inventory, while liquidating all existing inventory and assets. After this receivership period, all remaining stock leftover including parts was sold to CDNN Investments in Abilene, Texas and liquidated at discount rates.

The following are the primary variants of the Mateba revolver:

* Defense - 4&quot; Barrel, .357 Magnum
* Home Protection - 5&quot; Barrel, .44 Remington Magnum
* Dynamic Sportiva - Either 5&quot;- or 6&quot;-barrel, .357 Magnum, .41 Magnum, .44 Magnum
* Hunter - 8 3/8&quot; threaded Barrel, .357 Magnum, .44 Remington Magnum (.44 S&amp;W Special), .454 Casull

In addition, their barrels can be changed with interchangeable 3&quot;, 4&quot;, 5&quot;-, 6&quot;-, 7&quot;- and 8&quot;-inch barrels.

There was chambering in 30-357 AeT offered according to manuals released in 2000, it is unknown if any were actually produced in this caliber.

===Mateba Grifone===
Also available was the Mateba Grifone, a revolver carbine which came in three primary variants:
*Grifone - The standard Grifone mated a barrel, handguard and buttstock to the Autorevolver&#x27;s frame and action and included a barrel shroud with 4 widely spaced slots at the top.
*Grifone MoSer - Chambered in .454 Casull and mated to a longer barrel, Including a longer shroud with 5 widely spaced slots at the top.
*Grifone Short - Included a shorter barrel and shroud with 4 narrowly spaced slots.
It was available in the following Calibers:
*.357 Magnum - Grifone, Grifone Short
*.41 Magnum - Grifone
*.44 Magnum - Grifone, Grifone Short
*.454 Casull - Grifone MoSer

The buttstock came in two styles, a solid traditionally shaped walnut stock, or a &quot;skeletonized&quot; style all metal stock with a walnut cheekrest.
==Multiple cartridge capability==

Mateba Autorevolvers chambered in .357 Magnum can be loaded with .38 Special ammunition. Typical .38 Special loads do not have enough power to fully cycle the recoil mechanism, but the weapon will still function with a double-action trigger pull. There are two optional recoil springs designed specifically for .38 Special cartridges that can be installed by the operator to overcome this problem (.38 Special and .38 wadcutter). Replacing the spring requires the removal of the slide assembly, which is blocked by a retaining pin held in place by a small set screw in the trigger guard. The barrel shroud acts as the spring keeper and guide rod bushing.

Autorevolvers chambered in .44 Magnum can have the recoil spring swapped out to effectively cycle .44 Special, and .357 Magnum with 38 Special.

<text>The Portland Saturday Market is an outdoor arts and crafts market in Portland, Oregon. It is the largest continuously operated outdoor market in the United States. It is held every Saturday and Sunday from the beginning of March through December 24, in Tom McCall Waterfront Park underneath Burnside Bridge and south of the bridge, as well as within an adjacent plaza just across Naito Parkway, extending west to the Skidmore Fountain. The market&#x27;s hours of operations are from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays and 11:00am – 4:30pm on Sundays, and admission is free. The market is accessible by foot, bicycle, Segway, and TriMet&#x27;s MAX Light Rail line which stops near the market at the Skidmore Fountain stop. The market has over 400 members and generates an estimated $12 million in gross sales annually. It has become a central economic engine for the historic Old Town Chinatown neighborhood, and attracts an estimated 750,000 visitors to this area each year.&#x27;

==Structure and mission==

The Portland Saturday Market is a mutual-benefit non-tax-exempt nonprofit owned and run by the Members of the market. The Board of Directors and various committees are all run by members of the market, utilizing a democratic process. The focus of the market is on hand-crafted goods sold by the artisans who design and make them.

The mission of the Portland Saturday Market is to provide an environment that encourages the economic and artistic growth of emerging and accomplished artisans. Central to this mission shall be to operate a marketplace. That marketplace, and other market programs, shall honor craftsmanship, design innovation, marketing ethics, and authenticity of the product.

==History==

The market was founded in 1974 by craftspeople Sheri Teasdale and Andrea Scharf, who modeled it after the Saturday Market in Eugene, Oregon. It was founded as a mutual benefit corporation, under which all members would share in the cost and governance of the market, yet keep all profits they receive from selling their items. All items sold at the Saturday Market are required to be handmade by the person selling it, and a committee of members judge each new item against a minimum standard of quality.

Sock It To Me, a sock and apparel company based out of Portland, started at the Saturday Market.

In 2024, the market was designated an Oregon Heritage Tradition by the Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission.

==Location==
The group did not have a location for the market, until Bill Naito offered them a parking lot known as the &quot;Butterfly lot&quot;. A large butterfly mural hangs over the market today commemorating the past. For the first year that the market operated, there was no specific site plan. A board of directors was established and the first chair was Scott Nay who worked in the Human Resources Department in the city of Portland. He was instrumental in hiring the first market manager Dana Comfort who along with a well chosen staff began to organize the site by and under the Burnside Bridge. A clear site plan was eventually created, marking out booth spaces, defining aisles and a pattern for customer traffic. In 1976, the market moved to a site under the Burnside Bridge between First Avenue and Front Avenue (now Naito Parkway), where it then remained for the next 33 years.

===Relocation in 2009===

In April 2005, the Portland Development Commission and Portland Saturday Market began a study of potential sites that serve as a permanent location for the Saturday Market. Although the market had already been operating for three decades, it had always existed on a patchwork of short-term leases with private property owners, providing little or no long-term certainty. That situation was viewed as a disincentive to capital investment, due to a lack of mid-week activities on the site, and as reinforcing adverse social conditions, creating an unsafe area within the neighborhood along with the additional burden of weekly cleaning of the site before Market use. The long-range major goals for the Market included: a permanent location, improved infrastructure, and more protection from the weather, needing to be met in a cost-efficient manner. In October 2005, the city launched its own study, called the &quot;Ankeny/Burnside Development Framework Project&quot;, to assess the opportunities for the area and how best to direct public funding to increase private investment.
The recommendations from these studies eventually led to a plan which would move the market out of the space under the Burnside Bridge at First Avenue, to a new space one block east, in Tom McCall Waterfront Park, and include construction of an open-side shelter (called a &quot;pavilion&quot; by market representatives) to provide 8,000 square feet of semi-weather-protected space immediately south of the bridge. Ankeny Square, the small plaza located between the Skidmore Fountain and Naito Parkway, would continue to be used for vendor booths each weekend, in addition to the larger space to the east of Naito Parkway, within the park. The move would increase the number of craft-vendor spaces slightly, from 255 to 275. The intention was that Waterfront Park would lease the pavilion to the market on the weekends during the market season, while also leasing the area for other projects during the week. The project was overseen by the Portland Development Commission, who had recently concluded a three-year study on possible permanent locations. Also under the project&#x27;s umbrella was an accommodation for the headquarters of Mercy Corps. At the beginning of the 2009 season, the new space was not ready for use, so the market opened temporarily at its old location.

In May 2009, Saturday Market moved into its new location in Waterfront Park. Ankeny Plaza, a relatively small portion of the market, was retained as part of the reconfigured market and is used by about 50 vendors each weekend. In August 2009, a new public fountain was brought into use next to the market&#x27;s space, in the park at Ash Street, named the Bill Naito Legacy Fountain in honor of Portland businessman and civic leader Bill Naito, who had also been one of the Saturday Market&#x27;s early supporters.

==Sundays==
The Market operated Sundays from 1977 to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused many older vendors to retire from the market. Portland Saturday Market is hoping to reopen Sundays in 2024 depending on vendor interest.

<doc id="1288948" wikidata="Q428361" url="?curid=1288948" title="Capability Maturity Model Integration">
<text>Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process level improvement training and appraisal program. Administered by the CMMI Institute, a subsidiary of ISACA, it was developed at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). It is required by many U.S. Government contracts, especially in software development. CMU claims CMMI can be used to guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire organization.

CMMI defines the following five maturity levels (1 to 5) for processes: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing. CMMI Version 3.0 was published in 2023; Version 2.0 was published in 2018; Version 1.3 was published in 2010, and is the reference model for the rest of the information in this article. CMMI is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by CMU.

==Overview==
Originally CMMI addresses three areas of interest:

#Product and service development – CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV),
#Service establishment, management, – CMMI for Services (CMMI-SVC), and
#Product and service acquisition – CMMI for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ).

In version 2.0 these three areas (that previously had a separate model each) were merged into a single model.

CMMI was developed by a group from industry, government, and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at CMU. CMMI models provide guidance for developing or improving processes that meet the business goals of an organization. A CMMI model may also be used as a framework for appraising the process maturity of the organization. By January 2013, the entire CMMI product suite was transferred from the SEI to the CMMI Institute, a newly created organization at Carnegie Mellon.

==History==
CMMI was developed by the CMMI project, which aimed to improve the usability of maturity models by integrating many different models into one framework. The project consisted of members of industry, government and the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI). The main sponsors included the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the National Defense Industrial Association.

CMMI is the successor of the capability maturity model (CMM) or Software CMM. The CMM was developed from 1987 until 1997. In 2002, version 1.1 was released, version 1.2 followed in August 2006, and version 1.3 in November 2010. Some major changes in CMMI V1.3 are the support of agile software development, improvements to high maturity practices and alignment of the representation (staged and continuous).

According to the Software Engineering Institute (SEI, 2008), CMMI helps &quot;integrate traditionally separate organizational functions, set process improvement goals and priorities, provide guidance for quality processes, and provide a point of reference for appraising current processes.&quot;

Mary Beth Chrissis, Mike Konrad, and Sandy Shrum Rawdon were the authorship team for the hard copy publication of CMMI for Development Version 1.2 and 1.3. The Addison-Wesley publication of Version 1.3 was dedicated to the memory of Watts Humphry. Eileen C. Forrester, Brandon L. Buteau, and Sandy Shrum were the authorship team for the hard copy publication of CMMI for Services Version 1.3. Rawdon &quot;Rusty&quot; Young was the chief architect for the development of CMMI version 2.0. He was previously the CMMI Product Owner and the SCAMPI Quality Lead for the Software Engineering Institute.

In March 2016, the CMMI Institute was acquired by ISACA.

In April 2023, the CMMI V3.0 was released.

==Topics==

===Representation===
In version 1.3 CMMI existed in two representations: continuous and staged. The continuous representation is designed to allow the user to focus on the specific processes that are considered important for the organization&#x27;s immediate business objectives, or those to which the organization assigns a high degree of risks. The staged representation is designed to provide a standard sequence of improvements, and can serve as a basis for comparing the maturity of different projects and organizations. The staged representation also provides for an easy migration from the SW-CMM to CMMI.

In version 2.0 the above representation separation was cancelled and there is now only one cohesive model.

===Model framework (v1.3)===

Depending on the areas of interest (acquisition, services, development) used, the process areas it contains will vary. Process areas are the areas that will be covered by the organization&#x27;s processes. The table below lists the seventeen CMMI core process areas that are present for all CMMI areas of interest in version 1.3.

=== Maturity levels for services ===
The process areas below and their maturity levels are listed for the CMMI for services model:

Maturity Level 2 – Managed
* CM – Configuration Management
* MA – Measurement and Analysis
* PPQA – Process and Quality Assurance
* REQM – Requirements Management
* SAM – Supplier Agreement Management
* SD – Service Delivery
* WMC – Work Monitoring and Control
* WP – Work Planning

Maturity Level 3 – Defined
* CAM – Capacity and Availability Management
* DAR – Decision Analysis and Resolution
* IRP – Incident Resolution and Prevention
* IWM – Integrated Work Managements
* OPD – Organizational Process Definition
* OPF – Organizational Process Focus...
* OT – Organizational Training
* RSKM – Risk Management
* SCON – Service Continuity
* SSD – Service System Development
* SST – Service System Transition
* STSM – Strategic Service Management

Maturity Level 4 – Quantitatively Managed
* OPP – Organizational Process Performance
* QWM – Quantitative Work Management

Maturity Level 5 – Optimizing
* CAR – Causal Analysis and Resolution.
* OPM – Organizational Performance Management.

===Models (v1.3)===
CMMI best practices are published in documents called models, each of which addresses a different area of interest. Version 1.3 provides models for three areas of interest: development, acquisition, and services.
* CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV), v1.3 was released in November 2010. It addresses product and service development processes.
* CMMI for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ), v1.3 was released in November 2010. It addresses supply chain management, acquisition, and outsourcing processes in government and industry.
* CMMI for Services (CMMI-SVC), v1.3 was released in November 2010. It addresses guidance for delivering services within an organization and to external customers.

=== Model (v2.0) ===
In version 2.0 DEV, ACQ and SVC were merged into a single model where each process area potentially has a specific reference to one or more of these three aspects. Trying to keep up with the industry the model also has explicit reference to agile aspects in some process areas.

Some key differences between v1.3 and v2.0 models are given below:

# &quot;Process Areas&quot; have been replaced with &quot;Practice Areas (PA&#x27;s)&quot;. The latter is arranged by levels, not &quot;Specific Goals&quot;.
# Each PA is composed of a &quot;core&quot; [i.e. a generic and terminology-free description] and &quot;context-specific&quot; [ i.e. description from the perspective of Agile/ Scrum, development, services, etc.] section.
# Since all practices are now compulsory to comply, &quot;Expected&quot; section has been removed.
# &quot;Generic Practices&quot; have been put under a new area called &quot;Governance and Implementation Infrastructure&quot;, while &quot;Specific practices&quot; have been omitted.

# Two and five optional PA&#x27;s from &quot;Safety&quot; and &quot;Security&quot; purview have been included.

===Appraisal===
An organization cannot be certified in CMMI; instead, an organization is &quot;appraised&quot;. Depending on the type of appraisal, the organization can be awarded a maturity level rating (1–5) or a capability level achievement profile.

Many organizations find value in measuring their progress by conducting an appraisal. Appraisals are typically conducted for one or more of the following reasons:
# To determine how well the organization&#x27;s processes compare to CMMI best practices, and to identify areas where improvement can be made
# To inform external customers and suppliers of how well the organization&#x27;s processes compare to CMMI best practices
# To meet the contractual requirements of one or more customers

Appraisals of organizations using a CMMI model must conform to the requirements defined in the Appraisal Requirements for CMMI (ARC) document. There are three classes of appraisals, A, B and C, which focus on identifying improvement opportunities and comparing the organization&#x27;s processes to CMMI best practices. Of these, class A appraisal is the most formal and is the only one that can result in a level rating. Appraisal teams use a CMMI model and ARC-conformant appraisal method to guide their evaluation of the organization and their reporting of conclusions. The appraisal results can then be used (e.g., by a process group) to plan improvements for the organization.

The Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI) is an appraisal method that meets all of the ARC requirements. Results of a SCAMPI appraisal may be published (if the appraised organization approves) on the CMMI Web site of the SEI: Published SCAMPI Appraisal Results. SCAMPI also supports the conduct of ISO/IEC 15504, also known as SPICE (Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination), assessments etc.

This approach promotes that members of the EPG and PATs be trained in the CMMI, that an informal (SCAMPI C) appraisal be performed, and that process areas be prioritized for improvement. More modern approaches, that involve the deployment of commercially available, CMMI-compliant processes, can significantly reduce the time to achieve compliance. SEI has maintained statistics on the &quot;time to move up&quot; for organizations adopting the earlier Software CMM as well as CMMI. These statistics indicate that, since 1987, the median times to move from Level 1 to Level 2 is 23 months, and from Level 2 to Level 3 is an additional 20 months. Since the release of the CMMI, the median times to move from Level 1 to Level 2 is 5 months, with median movement to Level 3 another 21 months. These statistics are updated and published every six months in a maturity profile.

The Software Engineering Institute&#x27;s (SEI) team software process methodology and the use of CMMI models can be used to raise the maturity level. A new product called Accelerated Improvement Method (AIM) combines the use of CMMI and the TSP.

=== Security ===
To address user security concerns, two unofficial security guides are available. &quot;Considering the Case for Security Content in CMMI for Services&quot; has one process area, Security Management. &quot;Security by Design with CMMI for Development, Version 1.3&quot; has the following process areas:

* OPSD – Organizational Preparedness for Secure Development
* SMP – Secure Management in Projects
* SRTS – Security Requirements and Technical Solution
* SVV – Security Verification and Validation

While they do not affect maturity or capability levels, these process areas can be reported in appraisal results.

==Applications==
The SEI published a study saying 60 organizations measured increases of performance in the categories of cost, schedule, productivity, quality and customer satisfaction. The median increase in performance varied between 14% (customer satisfaction) and 62% (productivity). However, the CMMI model mostly deals with &quot;what&quot; processes should be implemented, and not so much with &quot;how&quot; they can be implemented. These results do not guarantee that applying CMMI will increase performance in every organization. A small company with few resources may be less likely to benefit from CMMI; this view is supported by the process maturity profile (page 10). Of the small organizations (&lt;25 employees), 70.5% are assessed at level 2: Managed, while 52.8% of the organizations with 1,001–2,000 employees are rated at the highest level (5: Optimizing).

Turner &amp; Jain (2002) argue that although it is obvious there are large differences between CMMI and agile software development, both approaches have much in common. They believe neither way is the &#x27;right&#x27; way to develop software, but that there are phases in a project where one of the two is better suited. They suggest one should combine the different fragments of the methods into a new hybrid method. Sutherland et al. (2007) assert that a combination of Scrum and CMMI brings more adaptability and predictability than either one alone. David J. Anderson (2005) gives hints on how to interpret CMMI in an agile manner.

CMMI Roadmaps, which are a goal-driven approach to selecting and deploying relevant process areas from the CMMI-DEV model, can provide guidance and focus for effective CMMI adoption. There are several CMMI roadmaps for the continuous representation, each with a specific set of improvement goals. Examples are the CMMI Project Roadmap, CMMI Product and Product Integration Roadmaps and the CMMI Process and Measurements Roadmaps. These roadmaps combine the strengths of both the staged and the continuous representations.
The combination of the project management technique earned value management (EVM) with CMMI has been described. To conclude with a similar use of CMMI, Extreme Programming (XP), a software engineering method, has been evaluated with CMM/CMMI (Nawrocki et al., 2002). For example, the XP requirements management approach, which relies on oral communication, was evaluated as not compliant with CMMI.

CMMI can be appraised using two different approaches: staged and continuous. The staged approach yields appraisal results as one of five &quot;maturity levels.&quot; The continuous approach yields one of four &quot;capability levels.&quot; The differences in these approaches are felt only in the appraisal; the best practices are equivalent resulting in equivalent process improvement results.

<text>Braided is a musical group consisting of Casey LeBlanc, Ashley Leitão, and Amber Fleury, who all competed on the third season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; in 2005. They are the third music group to come from an Idol show in the world, after Young Divas from Australia and Feminnem from Croatia.

==History==
During the 2005, Canadian Idol contest, Leitao came in ninth, Fleury eighth and LeBlanc fifth. 
The three were brought together by producer and &quot;Idol&quot; accompanist Mark Lalama, at the suggestion of his brother Paul. The band&#x27;s name was chosen because the group &quot;braids&quot; elements from across the country into one.

Braided began recording in Lalama&#x27;s studio at his farmhouse in Fenwick, Ontario. The single &quot;A Little Bit Closer&quot; was released in June 2006. Their debut album, &quot;Casey, Ashley and Amber&quot;, was released in August. Figure skater Elvis Stojko sang a duet with Leitao on the track &quot;Before You&quot;. The group toured during 2006–07 to promote the album.

== Critical reception ==
Bob Mersereau, writing in the &quot;Telegraph-Journal&quot;, gave them a mixed review, writing that producer and songwriter Mark Lalama &quot;gives them some cool &#x27;girl-group&#x27; &#x27;60s material which is bright and fun. But there&#x27;s also some schmaltz, ballad material that Celine Dion would pass on.&quot;

<text>[[Candy]], known also as sweets and confectionery, has a long history as a familiar food treat that is available in many varieties. Candy varieties are influenced by the size of the sugar crystals, aeration, sugar concentrations, colour and the types of sugar used.

Simple sugar or sucrose is turned into candy by dissolving it in water, concentrating this solution through cooking and allowing the mass either to form a mutable solid or to recrystallize. Maple sugar candy has been made in this way for thousands of years, with concentration taking place from both freezing and heating.

Other sugars, sugar substitutes, and corn syrup are also used. Jelly candies, such as gumdrops and gummies, use stabilizers including starch, pectin or gelatin. Another type of candy is cotton candy, which is made from spun sugar.

In their Thanksgiving Address, Native peoples of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy give special thanks to the Sugar Maple tree as the leader of all trees &quot;to recognize its gift of sugar when the People need it most&quot;. In traditional times, maple sugar candy reduced from sap was an important food source in the lean times of winter in North America.

==Western candies==
The following are candies in the Western world.

===Gum===

Chewing gum is often referred to as a type of candy.

===Chocolate===
Chocolate is made from the fermented, roasted and ground beans of the tropical cacao tree. In America, cocoa refers to ground cacao beans. Chocolate is the combination of cocoa, cocoa butter, sugar and other ingredients (milk, flavorings, and emulsifiers) and they are sweet.
===Classic candies===
Many of these candies were developed between the 1880s and 1950 by various candy-makers.
===Hard candy===

Hard candies, or boiled sweets, are sugary candies that dissolve slowly in the mouth. Among the artisanal hard candies, the &quot;pirulin&quot;, also known as the &quot;Heng Jia&quot; or &quot;Heng Li&quot; in Northern China, is a famous one in several Spanish-speaking countries, like Argentina, Mexico and Chile and its popularity has spread to certain parts of Greater Asia. There are many local and regional varieties, including the hazelnut-filled &quot;Mässmogge&quot; of Basel, Switzerland.
===Liquorice===
Licorice (liquorice) is a semi-soft candy that was originally flavored with a root extract of the Eurasian plant liquorice (&quot;Glycyrrhiza glabra&quot;), of the Fabaceae (legume) family. As a candy, they are often black with licorice flavor or red and strawberry or cherry flavored.

===Lollipops===
Lollipops or Lollies are hard candies on a stick. The name lollipop was first coined by George Smith, owner of a candy company called the Bradley Smith Company. George named the stick candy after his favorite race horse Lolly Pop and trademarked the name &quot;lollipop&quot; in 1931.
===Sours===
Sours are popular for their cringe inducing flavor and acidity.

<text>Edna Schmidt (August 8, 1969June 24, 2021) was a journalist who was a news anchor for &quot;Noticiero Univision&quot; Edición Nocturna. She was of Puerto Rican descent, and covered the September 11 attacks in New York City, the panic caused by the anthrax threat, and the execution of Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh.

==Early life and education==
Schmidt&#x27;s parents moved from Puerto Rico to Manhattan, New York City, where she was born. After receiving her primary and secondary education, Schmidt enrolled in college, where she majored in journalism. 

==Career==
Schmidt moved to Puerto Rico, where she started her career as a newscaster for WSJN-TV (Channel 24). In 1992, she went to Chicago, where she was offered a job at WGBO-TV (Channel 66) a local Spanish language station.

===Telefutura (2002-09)===
She lived in Chicago for 10 years before she was offered the position of anchorwoman in Telefutura, a division of Univision Communications, Inc., the leading Spanish-language media company in the U.S.

In April 2002, Schmidt accepted the offer and together with her husband moved to Miami, Florida where Telefutura has its headquarters. Schmidt was the inaugural anchor of &quot;Noticias al Minuto&quot; (Latest Minute News) until 2009, when she was promoted to &quot;Noticiero Univision: Fin de Semana&quot;. Among the notable events that Schmidt has covered are the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, the panic caused by the Anthrax threat, and the execution of Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh.

===Univision (2009-2011)===
She was working towards a master&#x27;s degree in journalism at Iowa State University. She was named the National Godmother of the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City June 10, 2007.

After 19 years of serving as anchor woman for Univision&#x27;s weekend newscasts, &quot;Noticiero Univision: Fin de Semana&quot;, María Antonieta Collins decided to leave Univision, thereby leaving the anchor chair vacated and would be filled in by substitutes notably Schmidt, Ilia Calderón, and Martín Berlanga.

From September 2005 to February 2011, Edna Schmidt with Enrique Teutelo co-anchored Univision&#x27;s weekend newscasts at 6:30pm and 11:30pm weekends. Edna Schmidt and Enrique Teutelo were praised by Hispanicmarketweekly.com, saying that Teutelo and Schmidt gave a fresh face to the news weekends because they often alternated in the delivery of the news. She was however replaced with Ilia Calderón in early March 2011.

On April 4, 2011 she returned to deliver the news at 11:30 pm co-anchoring with Ilia Calderón on Última Hora, now under its new name of &quot;Noticiero Univision: Edición Noctura&quot; (Evening Edition).

On July 1, 2011, Schmidt announced via Twitter that she was subbing as news anchor for &quot;¡Despierta América!&quot; for Sascha Pretto but that she would return to &quot;Noticias Univisión&quot;, where she stayed until September 2011, when she was let go.

==Fashion sense==
Schmidt was known for having a keen sense for fashion and quality attire while presenting Univision. As an example, viewers would always notice a broach, a flower or texture on her outfits.

==Death==
On June 24, 2021, Univision reported that she had died at age 51; her cause of death was not indicated.

<doc id="1288985" wikidata="Q7628498" url="?curid=1288985" title="Stueckelberg action">
<text>In field theory, the Stueckelberg action (named after Ernst Stueckelberg) describes a massive spin-1 field as an R (the real numbers are the Lie algebra of U(1)) Yang–Mills theory coupled to a real scalar field formula_1. This scalar field takes on values in a real 1D affine representation of R with formula_2 as the coupling strength.

:formula_3

This is a special case of the Higgs mechanism, where, in effect, and thus the mass of the Higgs scalar excitation has been taken to infinity, so the Higgs has decoupled and can be ignored, resulting in a nonlinear, affine representation of the field, instead of a linear representation — in contemporary terminology, a U(1) nonlinear -model.

Gauge-fixing formula_4, yields the Proca action.

This explains why, unlike the case for non-abelian vector fields, quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon is, in fact, renormalizable, even though it is not manifestly gauge invariant (after the Stückelberg scalar has been eliminated in the Proca action).

==Stueckelberg extension of the Standard Model==
The Stueckelberg extension of the Standard Model (&quot;StSM)&quot; consists of a gauge invariant kinetic term for a massive U(1) gauge field. Such a term can be implemented into the Lagrangian of the Standard Model
without destroying the renormalizability of the theory and further provides a mechanism for
mass generation that is distinct from the Higgs mechanism in the context of Abelian gauge theories.

The model involves a non-trivial
mixing of the Stueckelberg and the Standard Model sectors by including an additional term in the effective Lagrangian of the Standard Model given by 
:formula_5

The first term above is the Stueckelberg field strength, formula_6 and formula_7 are topological mass parameters and formula_8 is the axion.
After symmetry breaking in the electroweak sector the photon remains massless. The model predicts a new type of gauge boson dubbed formula_9 which inherits a very distinct narrow decay width in this model. The St sector of the StSM decouples from the SM in limit formula_10.

Stueckelberg type couplings arise quite naturally in theories involving compactifications of higher-dimensional string theory, in particular, these couplings appear in the dimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional N = 1 supergravity coupled to supersymmetric Yang–Mills gauge fields in the presence of internal gauge fluxes. In the context of intersecting D-brane model building, products of U(N) gauge groups are broken to their SU(N) subgroups via the Stueckelberg couplings and thus the Abelian gauge fields become massive. Further, in a much simpler fashion one may consider a model with only one extra dimension (a type of Kaluza–Klein model) and compactify down to a four-dimensional theory. The resulting Lagrangian will contain massive vector gauge bosons that acquire masses through the Stueckelberg mechanism.

<text>Congress Street Grounds is a former baseball ground located in Boston, Massachusetts. The ballpark, as the name implies, was along Congress Street, near the intersection of Thompson Place, and not far from the Fort Point Channel on South Boston Flats, a newly filled in piece of land on Boston Harbor. The ground was home to the Boston Reds, that played in the Players&#x27; League in 1890 and the American Association in 1891.

Although a short-lived facility, the ballpark witnessed some significant history. First, its occupants won league pennants in their two years of existence. Despite its success, the club was dropped during the NL-AA merger of 1892, as there was already an NL entry in Boston.

Then, between May and June 1894, Congress Street Grounds was the home to the Boston Beaneaters while their home grounds, the South End Grounds, were being rebuilt after the Great Roxbury Fire of May 15, 1894. It had a close left field fence, which benefited Boston&#x27;s Bobby Lowe just a couple of weeks later, on May 30, 1894, as he became the first batter to hit four home runs in a single game, all of them down the line in left field.

In parts of the years between 1892 and autumn of 1896, the field was used for various local sports, including Gaelic football, hurling, and track-and-field events. By the end of 1896, the ballpark had been dismantled and urban development took over the property.

The location is now occupied by several office buildings, and the alley behind them, which would go through the area of the outfield, was used in the 2006 film &quot;The Departed&quot;, in a key scene where Martin Sheen&#x27;s character is pushed off a roof.

Historic New England has a photo of the interior of the park.

<text>Millions is a 2004 British comedy-drama film directed by Danny Boyle, and starring Alex Etel, Lewis Owen McGibbon, and James Nesbitt. The film&#x27;s screenwriter Frank Cottrell-Boyce adapted his screenplay into a novel while the film was still in the process of being made. The novel was subsequently awarded the Carnegie Medal.

==Plot==
Damian, a 9-year-old Catholic boy, and his family move to the suburbs of Widnes after the death of his mother. One day, while playing in a cardboard box by the train tracks, Damian is disturbed by a bag of money flung from a passing train. He immediately shows the money to his brother, 12-year-old Anthony, and the brothers think of what they should do with it. Anthony wants to keep the money all to themselves, but Damian, being kind-hearted, religious, and inspired by a lecture at school, looks for ways to give his share of the money to help those in need.

Damian goes on to commit small acts of kindness, such as buying birds from pet shops and setting them free, and taking beggars to Pizza Hut. On the other hand, Anthony bribes other kids at school into being his transport and bodyguards, and looks into investing the money in real estate. A mysterious man comes snooping around the train tracks, and asks Damian if he has any money. Damian thinks that the man is a beggar and tells him he has &quot;loads of money&quot;. However, a suspicious Anthony gives the man a jar full of coins to cover Damian&#x27;s tracks.

The story takes place in the weeks leading up to the United Kingdom&#x27;s fictionalised changover to the European single currency (€), an event publicised as &quot;€ Day&quot;. An assembly is held at Damian&#x27;s school to inform the children about the change, as well as to educate them about helping the poor. Realising that the money will be worthless after a few days, Damian decides that it would be best to give it away before the adoption of the Euro. He drops £1,000 into the donation can at assembly. The woman collecting the money, Dorothy, reports Damian to the head teacher. Anthony lies that he and Damian stole the money from missionaries, and both Damian and Anthony are grounded that night. When their father collects them from school, he chats with Dorothy and there is an obvious attraction between them.

After the donation, Anthony&#x27;s friend informs them that a train carrying banknotes that were meant to be destroyed after the conversion had been robbed. One bag was stolen in a diversion; the robbers then distracted the police before escaping into a crowd of football fans. However, one robber stayed on the train disguised as one of the emergency staff, dispersing the money by throwing it off the train at various locations where it could later be collected by other accomplices. The boys logically conclude that their money was stolen, and Damian, who thought the money was from God, feels terrible upon hearing this.

The mysterious man on the train tracks turns out to be one of the robbers looking for the bag. He eventually finds out where Damian lives and ransacks the house. Damian informs his father about the money just before they come home to find their house destroyed. The robber, who is still in the house, hides in Damian&#x27;s room after ransacking it. Damian&#x27;s father, who had resolved to give the money back, decides that if the robbers are going to steal his family&#x27;s Christmas, then he will steal the robbers&#x27; money. The family, as well as Dorothy, go on a massive shopping spree on Christmas Eve.

That night, while they are asleep, their house is bombarded by beggars and charities begging for donations and, seeing the confusion that ensues, Damian runs off to the train tracks to burn the money, realising that it is doing them more harm than good. Meanwhile, a robber sneaks through the back door and is arrested by the police. While Damian is burning the money, he is visited by his dead mother, who tells him not to worry about her.

In the final scene, the audience sees Damian&#x27;s dream of the family flying a rocket ship to Africa and helping develop water wells, while Damian narrates over the scene that each family member but him had hidden a little bit of the money beforehand. Damian convinced them to spend this money on the wells he is dreaming about. (Earlier in the film, wells were shown to be the cheapest way of improving the quality of life for many African communities.)

==Production==
In a 2014 interview, Boyle stated that, had he and Cottrell-Boyce been more confident, they would have made the film as a musical, with the characters singing and dancing. Boyle was interested in having Noel Gallagher write original songs for the film.

==Release==

=== Home media ===
&quot;Millions&quot; was released on DVD on 1 November 2005. The film is also available on Disney+ after its launch on 12 November 2019.

===Box office===
The film was a modest box office success, earning £7,830,074.88 worldwide despite a limited release to just 340 theatres, contending with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. Around £3,987,642.22 of the final box office was received in the UK alone.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Millions&quot; received positive reviews, earning an 88% approval rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The critical consensus calls the film &quot;a charming children fable even adults can enjoy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 74 out of 100 based on reviews from 33 critics.

Roger Ebert awarded it a rating of four out of four and declared it &quot;one of the best films of the year&quot;. He went on to write, &quot;. . . although &quot;Millions&quot; uses special effects and materializing saints, it&#x27;s a film about real ideas, real issues and real kids. It&#x27;s not sanitized brainless eye candy. Like all great family movies, it plays equally well for adults—maybe better, since we know how unusual it is.&quot; It was on his Top 10 movies of 2005 placing at number 10.

Richard Roeper, Roger Ebert&#x27;s co-host on the television show &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, called it &quot;One of the most stylish and eccentric films about childhood dreams and heartbreaks that I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

Leonard Maltin praised the film upon its DVD release, saying &quot;&quot;Millions&quot; is a winning and unpredictable fable from England that will charm viewers both young and old.&quot;

====Christian film critics====
&quot;Catholic News Service&quot;s Harry Forbes wrote, &quot;Boyle&#x27;s offbeat tale – with a clever script by Frank-Cottrell Boyce – features good performances all around, especially by the remarkable Etel, who displays just the right innocence and religious fervor in delightful vignettes with the saints. The script dramatizes the themes of money and its complexities and the need for societal philanthropy without being heavy-handed, making this ideal entertainment for older adolescents and up.&quot;

Sister Rose Pacatte, F.S.P. (AmericanCatholic.org) commented, &quot;&quot;Millions&quot; engages, inspires and is just quirky enough to be charming.&quot; She added, &quot;Damien&#x27;s familiarity with the saints and his recitation of their biographies is accurate and very funny.&quot;

Although praising the film for its positive depiction of the role the Christian faith can play in a young boy&#x27;s life, some publications have pointed out details that viewers might find objectionable or deem inappropriate for younger audiences. As Harry Forbes wrote, &quot;The film contains a couple of mildly crude expressions, some intense episodes of menace, a momentary sexual situation, religious stereotyping, and a brief scene where the brothers look, with boyish curiosity, at a web site for women&#x27;s bras on a computer.&quot; As such, he explained, &quot;the USCCB Office for Film &amp; Broadcasting classification is A-II – adults and adolescents.&quot;

Johnathan Wooten of &quot;Christian Spotlight on Entertainment&quot; downplayed the significance, saying, &quot;Those concerned about objectionable content will not find much to offend here though. There is very little violence (a short robbery scene, a very brief moment of a child in peril). Sexual content includes a glimpse of an unmarried couple in bed together as well as pre-pubescent boy viewing an Internet lingerie ad. When played out the latter scene actually has a strange wholesomeness to it considering his other viewing options. The only profanity is some mild British slang.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival on 14 September 2004.

<doc id="1289083" wikidata="Q3488439" url="?curid=1289083" title="Day of the Dove">
<text>&quot;Day of the Dove&quot; is the seventh episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Jerome Bixby and directed by Marvin Chomsky, it was first broadcast November 1, 1968.

In the episode, an alien forces the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; into a brutal conflict with the Klingons.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; responds to a distress call from a human colony, but on arrival finds no signs of any type of inhabited settlement. A landing party, including Captain Kirk and Ensign Chekov, beams down to investigate further. A few moments later, they are found and surrounded by Klingons who have transported to the surface from their own orbiting vessel. Commander Kang accuses the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew of firing upon their vessel and demands that they surrender immediately. Suddenly, Chekov makes a move to attack the Klingons, claiming they had killed his brother. Kang&#x27;s men subdue him and use an agonizer device to torture him, forcing Kirk to agree to surrender. However, upon contacting the ship and asking to be beamed up, Kirk secretly warns First Officer Spock about the Klingons. Spock uses the transporter to materialize the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crewmen first, followed by the Klingons, who are overpowered by &quot;Enterprise&quot; security personnel. Kang surrenders and he and the other Klingons, including his wife Mara, a science officer, are escorted to secure quarters on the ship.

Meanwhile, a glowing entity composed of pure energy, which had initially emerged on the planet below, enters the &quot;Enterprise&quot; undetected and interfaces with its controls. The ship lurches into warp at maximum speed headed for the edge of the galaxy. With the crew panicked, the entity then traps 392 members of the &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; crew belowdecks by closing bulkheads and making them impenetrable. The 38 remaining members of the crew are equal in numbers to the Klingons. With tempers high – and spurred on by the sudden materialization of swords and other antique hand weapons – they begin to fight.

Spock soon detects the entity, apparently feeding off the violence. When informed by Lt. Sulu that Chekov never had a brother and is an only child, Kirk realizes that the entity is capable of implanting false memories in order to trigger aggression. Kirk and Spock try to calm the crew&#x27;s escalating furor to no avail. Kirk believes that if he can get to Kang, the Klingon commander can help stop his crew from fighting and help return the ship to a normal state.

Kirk and Spock work their way through the animosity aboard the ship and happen upon Chekov sexually assaulting Mara. Kirk pulls Chekov from her and knocks him unconscious, relenting only when Spock reminds him that Chekov was not in control of himself. Bringing Mara along, they take Chekov to Sickbay, where Dr. McCoy reports that crewmen gravely wounded in the fighting are healing at a much faster than normal rate; the entity wants everyone alive and fighting. Mara is initially skeptical that the entity exists, but is persuaded after realizing Kirk is completely unwilling to kill her. She agrees to lead Kirk to Kang in Engineering. They travel by the risky technique of intra-ship beaming – using the transporter between two points within the ship.

In Engineering, Kang distrusts Kirk&#x27;s explanation of the entity despite Mara&#x27;s assurance, and believing she was assaulted, challenges Kirk to a sword duel. As they clash, and with the entity hovering and pulsating a bright red nearby, Kirk implores Kang to stop, telling him that they may become its puppets for a thousand lifetimes if they continue to fight. Kang acknowledges Kirk&#x27;s warning and the fact that their fighting is pointless. Kirk and Kang order their respective crews to lay down their arms. To starve the entity, Kirk and Kang encourage their crews to act jovially and to laugh with one another loudly. The entity fades and leaves the ship.

==Production==
This episode was remastered in 2006 and aired January 5, 2008, as part of the remastered Original Series. It was preceded three weeks earlier by the remastered version of &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; and followed a week later by the remastered version of &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot; Aside from remastered video and audio, and the all-CGI animation of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; that is standard among the revisions, specific changes to this episode also include:
* The planet Beta XII-A has been given a more realistic Earth-like appearance.
* New scenes and more dramatic shots of the Klingon battle cruiser have been added, including replaced footage of the ship as it explodes above the planet.

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;B−&#x27; rating, describing it as having potential, but being hampered by a script that fails to act on that.
Io9&#x27;s 2014 listing of the top 100 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes placed &quot;Day of the Dove&quot; as the 99th best episode of all series up to that time, out of over 700 episodes of the franchise.

In 2016, SyFy ranked guest star Michael Ansara as Kang (the Klingon leader), as the 13th best guest star on the original series. Ansara went on to reprise his role as Kang decades later on the Star Trek spin-offs &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager.&quot; Ansara reprised the character Kang in DS9&#x27;s &quot;Blood Oath&quot;, which also featured John Colicos as Kor and William Campbell as Koloth, who, like Ansara, had been guest stars in the original series playing original Klingons with that name.

In 2018, &quot;Collider&quot; ranked this episode the 16th best original series episode.

==Home media==
This episode was released on LaserDisc, paired with &quot;Spectre of the Gun&quot; in 1987 in the United States.

This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン for the set.

<text>The Shaheed Minar ( romanised: &#x27;Shohid Minar&#x27; ) is a national monument in Dhaka, Bangladesh, established to commemorate those killed during the Bengali Language Movement demonstrations of 1952 in then East Pakistan.

On 21 and 22 February 1952, students from Dhaka University and Dhaka Medical College and political activists were killed when the Pakistani police force opened fire on Bengali protesters who were demanding official status for their native tongue, Bengali. The massacre occurred near Dhaka Medical College and Ramna Park in Dhaka. A makeshift monument was erected on 23 February by students of Dhaka Medical College and other educational institutions, but soon demolished on 26
February by the Pakistani police force.

The Language Movement gained momentum, and after a long struggle, Bengali gained official status in Pakistan (with Urdu) in 1956. To commemorate the dead, the Shaheed Minar was designed and built by Bangladeshi sculptors Hamidur Rahman in collaboration with Novera Ahmed. Construction was delayed by martial law, but the monument was finally completed in 1963, and stood until the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, when it was demolished completely during Operation Searchlight. After Bangladesh gained independence later that year, it was rebuilt. It was expanded in 1983.

National, mourning, cultural and other activities are held each year on 21 February (&quot;Ekushey February&quot;) to mark Language Movement Day or &quot;Shaheed Dibas&quot; (Martyrs&#x27; Day), centred on the Shaheed Minar. Since 2000, 21 February is also recognised as International Mother Language Day.

==Location==

The Shaheed Minar is situated near Dhaka Medical College Hospital and in the Dhaka University area. It is adjacent to the Mathematics Department of Dhaka University.

==History==
===1952–1971===

The first Shaheed Minar was built immediately after the events of 21–22 February 1952. According to Dr. Sayeed Haider the main planner and the designer of the first Shaheed Minar, the decision to build it was first made by the students of Dhaka Medical College. Shaheed Minar is situated near Dhaka Medical College Hospital and in the Dhaka University area. It is adjacent to the Mathematics department of Dhaka University. It is only 0.5 kilometres (0.3 mi) away from Shahbag and 0.25 km (0.16 mi) distant from Chankharpul. Shaheed Minar is an outstanding monument of Bangladesh. It was built to tribute the martyrs who given up their life for language. The main incident had been occurring inside of Dhaka medical college hospital. So a decision was taken to build a memorial adjacent to DMCH. The planning started at midnight on 22 February, and the work started the next day. This Minar was sponsored by Pearu Sardar, one of the old Dhaka panchayet sardars, when some of the students asked his help at midnight of 22 February, to contribute the raw materials needed to build the monument. Although curfew was in place, students started building the Minar in the afternoon of 23 February. They worked through the night and finished it at dawn. A hand written paper was attached to the Minar with &quot;Shaheed Smritistombho&quot; written on it. The original Minar was on a base measuring . The Minar was inaugurated by the father of Shafiur Rahman, Molvi. Mahabubur Rahman, who killed during the massacre. It was demolished on 26 February by the police and Pakistani Army. Smaller versions of the memorial were built in other places. The first Shaheed Minar monument was then destroyed four days after its erection, on February 26, 1952, by the Pakistani Police and Army. A signboard placed by the police force on top of the rubble from the Minar read &quot;mosque&quot;.

Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the then police force, a new Shaheed Minar (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 at the same place, to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. This minar was inaugurated by the then Professor of Dhaka University and the pioneer and most prominent cultural and literary personality Natyaguru Nurul Momen. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect Hamidur Rahman began in 1957 with the support of the United Front government. Following the formation of the provincial government by the United Front in April 1954, the anniversary of 21 February was declared a holiday and it became possible to construct the new monument. A foundation stone was laid in 1956, and a government committee chaired by University of Dhaka Vice-Chancellor Dr Mahmud Husain and including the principal of the Fine College of Arts, Zainul Abedin, was constituted to plan, design, and approve the monument&#x27;s construction. The committee approved the design of sculptor Hamidur Rahman, followed by the construction of Shaheed Minar, starting in 1957. Hamidur Rahman&#x27;s model was a huge complex on a large area of land in the yard of Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The enormous design included a half-circular column to symbolise the mother with her fallen sons standing on the monument&#x27;s central dais. Yellow and deep blue pieces of stained glass, symbolising eyes reflecting the sun, were also to be placed in the columns. The marble floor was designed to reflect the moving shadows of the columns. The basement of the Minar also included a fresco depicting the history of the language movement. A railing decorated with Bengali alphabet was to be constructed in front. Two footmarks coloured red and black, indicating the two opposite forces, were also in the design. Besides this a museum and a library were also included in Hamidur Rahman&#x27;s design. A fountain shaped like an eye was also to be constructed. Rahman specifically designed the materials of the monument to withstand the area&#x27;s tropical climate.
Construction started in November 1957, under the supervision of Hamidur Rahman and Novera Ahmed. Most of the work, including the basement, platform, some of the columns with the rails, footprints and some of the murals were also finished when martial law was declared in the area, and the construction was forced to a halt. Construction work was completed in 1963, leaving much of Fatamatuj&#x27;s design unfinished. It was inaugurated on 21 February 1963, by the mother of Abul Barkat, Hasina Begum. The Minar was severely damaged by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The columns were destroyed on the night of the commencement of the genocide, 25 March 1971.
The Pakistani Army crushed the Minar and placed over the rubble a signboard reading &quot;Mosque&quot;.

===1972–present===

In 1972, a committee headed by the then president Abu Sayeed Chowdhury was formed and renovation work began. The original sketch was ignored, while the Construction and Building Directorate followed the 1963 design. The construction went quickly, according to a modified design from 1963. The murals destroyed by the Pakistani army were not restored and the basement was sealed off. Hamidur Rahman&#x27;s original design was not approved by the directorate in the renovation work. In the mid-eighties, the monument underwent further renovation under the supervision of the then Department of Architecture chief architect SHM Abul Bashar, which extended the area of the Shaheed Minar premises, giving it a square shape from a triangular one. Quarters concerned demanded proper implementation of the design by Hamidur Rahman with the help of sculptor Novera Ahmed and Danish architect Gean Deleuran. ASM Ismail said that because of the extension, two entrances to the basement murals were permanently closed, and after remaining in an abandoned state for 15 years, the murals had lost much of their gloss. In the 1983 renovation, the original poor materials were lined with marble stone. A museum and library were also featured in the original plan. In August 2010, the High Court issued eight directives for the maintenance and renovation of the Shaheed Minar and asked the Public Works Department to establish a museum and a library on its premises.

==Architecture and significance==
The enormous design includes a half-circular arrangement of columns to symbolise the mother, with her fallen sons, standing on the monument&#x27;s central dais, and the red sun shining behind. The Central Shaheed Minar of Dhaka goes up to a height of and was made with marble stones. The stairs and barrier are highlighted in white, to create a divine look. The fence on both sides is painted with lines from poems of legendary poets in iron letters. As the visitors enter the monument they will find two statues of the patriots who sacrificed their lives in that heinous police firing of 1952. The marble floor was designed to reveal the moving shadows of the columns. The basement of the Shaheed Minar also included a 1,500-square-foot (140 m2) mural representing the history of the Language Movement.

Hurried repair of the Shaheed Minar resulted in the Minar to be reconstructed incorrectly. The height of the column was shorter and the head bent more than originally planned, and the proportions of different parts of the monument were not properly maintained.

The Language Movement was one of the formidable movements which has come up in the country of Bangladesh, thus the Central Shaheed Minar epitomises efforts to represent the spirit of nationalism and also highlight the importance of the Bengali language in the social and cultural progress of the country. As a result, the Shaheed Minar has a very significant place in the social and cultural mechanism of Bangladesh.

At present, all national, mourning, cultural and other activities held each year, regarding 21 February, have been centred on the Shaheed Minar.

==Replicas and controversy==

The largest replicas of Shaheed Minar in Bangladesh are located in Barisal and Madaripur. Among them, the foundation stone of the replica located in Barisal was laid by the then president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1972. The replica located at Madaripur was inaugurated in 2021.

Apart from Bangladesh and India, there are at least 100 replicas of Shahid Minar in the world. The replica of Shaheed Minar was first built abroad in 1997 in Oldham, Britain. Replicas were later built in Altab Ali Park in Whitechapel, London and in Luton. There are 4 replicas of Shaheed Minar in West Bengal of which two are located in the city of Kolkata. A replica was erected in 2005 in Tokyo, the capital of Japan. A replica is also located in Ashfield Park in Sydney, Australia. A replica was opened in Toronto, Canada on 27 November 2021. Another replica was inaugurated in 2023 in Perris, California. A Shaheed Minar (costing 70 thousand euros to build) was inaugurated in Paris, the capital of France, on 8 October 2023 (the second one in France, the first was built in Toulouse).

Although there are replicas of Shaheed Minar in different parts of Bangladesh, some of them have a different structure than the original structure, so there has been a lot of controversy about them. In 2014, a Shaheed Minar was constructed at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. It was criticized for being different from the original design of the Central Shaheed Minar. For the same reason, the Shaheed Minars of various districts including Jagannath University have given rise to criticism. As a result of all this, on 14 June 2022, the High Court issued a rule for the formulation of policies for the construction of Shaheed Minar.

<doc id="1289091" wikidata="Q3488808" url="?curid=1289091" title="Wink of an Eye">
<text>&quot;Wink of an Eye&quot; is the eleventh episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Arthur Heinemann, based on a story by Gene L. Coon (under the pen name Lee Cronin), and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast on November 29, 1968.

In the episode, normally invisible time-accelerated aliens take over the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and attempt to abduct the crew for use as breeding stock.

==Plot==
In answer to a distress call, the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the planet Scalos. Captain Kirk beams down with a landing party to a city with no evidence of life, except for an intermittent insect-like buzzing. Crewman Compton disappears before Dr. McCoy&#x27;s eyes, and Kirk orders the landing party back to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Upon their return, the ship begins to experience strange malfunctions, and Engineering reports the sudden appearance of an unknown device attached to the ship&#x27;s life support systems. Kirk and Spock attempt to disconnect the device but are prevented from doing so by an unseen force.

Back on the bridge, Kirk decides to consult with the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s computers for possible counteractions against what they call the enemy, then allow the unseen enemy to take the next step, and asks for coffee. As he sips it, the bridge crew appears to slow down. Suddenly, a beautiful woman in a colorful gown appears on the bridge and greets Kirk warmly before introducing herself: &quot;Deela, the enemy,&quot; in response to the computer&#x27;s designation of her people for their actions on the ship.

Deela explains that Kirk has been placed in a state of hyperacceleration, rendering him invisible to the rest of his crew, in order to allow him to see and hear the Scalosians. When pressed as to why this has been done, Deela admits that she is the Scalosians&#x27; queen, and Kirk will become their king and enjoy life on Scalos. Kirk attempts to parley with Deela to stay with her on Scalos in return for having her people repair the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and release it with its crew, but she refuses his offer.

Kirk attempts to stun Deela, only for her to laugh and insist that he point the weapon at her and try it. The captain complies, and is stunned to find the phaser beam is slowed down within Deela&#x27;s hyperaccelerated existence: she easily evades the stun beam and disarms Kirk with her Scalosian side-arm. Queen Deela assures a frustrated Captain Kirk that nothing can be done to change his new existence or return him to his crew as he insists.

Kirk returns to Life Support and discovers that Compton is still alive, having also been accelerated, and is willingly working with the Scalosians, having taught the intruding aliens how to operate the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s systems. After Deela&#x27;s chief scientist Rael incapacitates Kirk with his Scalosian weapon, Compton turns against the Scalosians for harming his captain, only to be knocked back by a physical blow to draw blood; he rapidly ages and dies. A worried Scalosian woman named Mira, with whom Compton was selected to mate, is placated by Rael: &quot;another will be secured for you&quot;.

After a confrontation with Rael, Kirk surmises that the unknown device is intended to turn the &quot;Enterprise&quot; into a cryogenic storage unit. He records a message to Spock explaining what he has learnt; Deela, confident in her people&#x27;s success, allows this. Their plan, she explains, is to use the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew to help propagate their species, whose men have been rendered sterile by the same natural disaster that caused their accelerated state. After a heated debate on the ethics of this plan, Kirk rushes away and disables the transporter. Deela, finding it inoperative, pretends to believe Kirk&#x27;s claim to be ignorant of the problem.

Kirk begins to exhibit the sort of docility seen with Compton; however, this is a ruse that allows him to seize Deela&#x27;s weapon. On his way to Life Support, Kirk meets newly-accelerated Spock, who has heard Kirk&#x27;s message and determined the cause of his hyperacceleration was a dose of the polluted Scalosian water. The two arrive at Life Support, where Kirk uses the Scalosian weapon to stun Rael and destroy the cryogenic device.

After transporting Deela and her party back to the planet, Spock reveals that he has brought a possible antidote to the Scalosian water. Kirk takes a dose immediately, while Spock takes advantage of his accelerated state to effect repairs on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Star Trek&quot; novelist Dayton Ward judged that &quot;the setup for &#x27;Wink of an Eye&#x27; is interesting enough at first blush — a race of beings who move through time at a rate so fast that they&#x27;re all but undetectable. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s upon the second and subsequent blushes that the concept begins to fall apart.&quot; He writes that the Scalosians had too limited imagination for continuing their race, and that mating with members of other species would be no help. He found the science wanting, though &quot;I have to admit that here it provides for one of the series&#x27; more original &#x27;redshirt deaths.&#x27;&quot; Ward did admire the set design: &quot;Clever use of tilted camera angles and lighting help to sell the illusion of the characters moving about the ship at their hyper-accelerated rate. One nice touch is the slowing down of the various lights and gauges that fill the bridge&#x27;s workstations when Kirk and Deela are there.&quot;

David Alan Mack, also a &quot;Star Trek&quot; novelist, wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s not a bad idea for an episode, but the execution on this one felt sorely lacking.&quot; He noted some gaps in logic: &quot;Still, how does one propagate a species by mating one&#x27;s women with aliens? ... And if time moves so slowly for them, why would they need to place the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew in suspended animation? Wouldn&#x27;t a few days&#x27; worth of knockout drugs suffice?&quot;

Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; was unimpressed by the episode, assigning it a B− and noting some plot holes: &quot;They manage to beam aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; somehow, which doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense, science-wise. If their speed makes them invisible to the computer as life-forms, how would the transporter even work? Especially since they get brought on without anyone on the ship realizing it.&quot; Handlen judges that the &quot;hook is clever,&quot; although &quot;the ep might&#x27;ve been stronger if it had spent more time focusing on the mystery, and the danger that mystery represented, instead of dropping Kirk down the rabbit hole and spoiling the question so early on.&quot; He concludes, &quot;In a stronger season, &#x27;Eye&#x27; would&#x27;ve been a low spot, a perfunctory by-the-numbers programmer which, while not embarrassing, wouldn&#x27;t have made much of an impression. Here, it reminds us that, for a while anyway, competency was the least we could hope to expect from the series.&quot;

Melissa N. Hayes-Gehrke of the University of Maryland found more problems with the science:
StarTrekReviews.com found some praise: &quot;There&#x27;s no character interaction between our heroes, save for the wonderful moment when Kirk meets Spock in the corridor and simply smiles&quot;.

<text>Union Park is a former baseball ground located in Baltimore, Maryland. The ground was home to the Baltimore Orioles during their first &quot;glory years&quot; in the 1890s. It was located in an area bounded by East 25th Street to the north, 24th Street to the south, Hunter Street to the west and Barclay Street to the east. Guilford Avenue teed into 24th from the south, behind right-center field.

The Orioles opened this park during the 1891 season, abandoning Oriole Park. Their first game there was on May 11, 1891, an 8–4 victory over the St. Louis Browns in front of over 10,000 fans. At that time they were playing in the then-major American Association. After that season, the Association folded, and four of its teams were absorbed into the National League, including the Orioles. The Orioles became a perennial contender during that time. Despite that success, they were dropped when the National League contracted after the 1899 season. The legacy of those Orioles lived on through the later achievements of their many Hall of Fame players, such as John McGraw, Wilbert Robinson, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler.
Slugger Dan Brouthers played first base for the Orioles during the 1894 and 1895 seasons. On June 16, 1894, he hit a home run over the distant center field fence, the ball landing on Guilford Avenue and finally rolling to a stop at 23rd Street. The Baltimore &quot;Sun&quot; for April 18 described it as &quot;the longest ever made on the grounds.&quot; Decades later, the blow was still being talked about, and due to the distance it rolled was facetiously described as a 1,300 foot homer. 

There was a destructive fire on January 14, 1895, which destroyed the grandstand and a clubhouse. The structure was rebuilt and the Orioles were able to continue to use ballpark for their remaining seasons.

Today the site is a residential area of Barclay with 321 East 25th Street once located next to the grandstand. That and other buildings visible in the background of the 1890s photo of the ballpark&#x27;s exterior still stand today.

<doc id="1289107" wikidata="Q960192" url="?curid=1289107" title="D-VHS">
<text>D-VHS is a digital video recording format developed by JVC, in collaboration with Hitachi, Matsushita, and Philips. The &quot;D&quot; in D-VHS originally stood for &quot;Data&quot;, but JVC renamed the format as &quot;Digital VHS&quot;. Released in December 1997, it uses the same physical cassette format and recording mechanism as S-VHS, but requires higher-quality and more expensive tapes and is capable of recording and displaying both standard-definition and high-definition content. The content data format is in MPEG transport stream, the same data format used for most digital television applications. It used MPEG-2 encoding and was standarized as IEC 60774-5.

== Design ==

As a final effort for VHS, the D-VHS system had significant advantages as a highly versatile domestic recorder (the other tape-based formats are DV and Digital8, which never gained any traction except as camcorder media), but given the wholesale move to DVD and then hard disk drive (HDD) recording, the format failed to make any headway into the video market.

Existing tape media is bulky and more expensive than hard drives. Although cable companies are gradually switching to the H.264 codec, this should not be an issue for D-VHS units since they can act purely as data stores (like a hard drive but using tape instead), and thereby pass the previously recorded H.264 data directly to the Set-top Box or TV (via i.Link/FireWire). Another alternative is a lengthy transfer to a computer for viewing. Finally, since machines are no longer manufactured, maintenance of current recorders may prove difficult.

D-VHS&#x27;s primary advantage is that it is still the best way to archive &quot;encrypted&quot; high definition material from cable programming in the US. Cable, satellite companies, TiVo, and PCs equipped with cable card tuners all offered high-definition digital video recorders, but archival has proven to be an obstacle, as proprietary boxes have restrictions on moving encrypted content. Outside of D-VHS, only HD capture devices that use an analog conversion process, such as the Hauppauge HD PVR, have enabled removal of encrypted content off many of the above proprietary boxes. This uses an analog conversion process, producing slightly degraded but still high definition grade recordings. D-VHS, on the other hand, does not need to take advantage of this so-called &quot;analog hole&quot;, since D-VHS makes possible a pure bit-for-bit recording with no conversion necessary. This is made possible by compliance with CCI flag values carried by the digital streams, wherein only D-VHS is allowed to digitally move recordings of content originally flagged as Copy Once from a DVR device and onto a D-VHS tape. This programming that complies with the CCI flags then marks such material on the tape such that no second generation copies can be made from the tape itself, though additional copies can still be made directly from the original DVR unit to additional tapes.

Monthly rental fees to cable, TiVo, and satellite were also less with D-VHS.

The only PAL D-VHS model sold in Europe was the JVC HM-DR10000, also sold as the Philips VR-20D, and was standard definition only. This model was not a bitstream recorder, although it did have a FireWire input. Instead it is best thought of as a digital recorder for traditional analog inputs such as domestic analog TV and digiboxes for digital broadcasts. The deck was able to record D-VHS signals onto S-VHS tapes, which made it a cost-effective source of high quality domestic recordings (the US version also allows use of cheaper S-VHS media). Pictures were noticeably superior to S-VHS and were essentially transparent when compared to an off-air source. Using the LS3 mode, approximately 17.25 hours of digital video could be stored on a S-VHS E-240. The deck&#x27;s biggest shortcomings were the lack of a DV output and, perhaps more crucially, the lack of RGB input via the SCART connector. NTSC versions had component video outputs.

== Tape length and speeds ==

D-VHS VCRs can record at multiple speeds. &quot;HS&quot; is &quot;High Speed&quot;, &quot;STD&quot; is &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;LS&quot; is &quot;Low Speed&quot;; where LS3 and LS5 represent 3 and 5 times the standard length of tape, respectively. High-definition content such as 1920x1080 or 1280x720 is typically stored at 28.2 Mbit/s (HS speed). Standard-definition content such as 720x576 (720x480) can be stored at bit rates from 14.1 Mbit/s down to 2.8 Mbit/s (STD, LS3, LS5 speeds).

The quality of STD speed is actually superior to the average DVD, since this speed has a much higher bitrate (approximately 14 versus 5 Mbit/s average) and suffers few compression artifacts. LS2 speed has a bitrate of 7 Mbits/s. The LS3 speed is roughly equal to an amateur DVD with some visible artifacts in high-action scenes (4.7 Mbit/s), and LS5 appears similar to a medium-quality video download (2.8 Mbit/s). JVC&#x27;s HM-DH40000U and SR-VD400U were the only units to support LS5 recording.

As a result of all these different speeds, the tape labels are a bit confusing for the consumer. D-VHS was originally a standard definition format that recorded at the STD speed. When High Definition recording and HS speed was later introduced, it required twice the amount of tape. For this reason, a DF-240 will record 240 minutes of standard definition, and 240/2 = 120 minutes of high definition. When reviewing the table, note that the digital speeds HS and STD are equivalent to the older analog speeds SP and LP.

== Pre-recorded tapes ==
In 2002, prerecorded D-VHS cassettes were sold under the brand name D-Theater in the US. While D-Theater is a D-VHS tape, it is incompatible with D-VHS decks not bearing the D-Theater logo. They provide content in both 720p and 1080i as well as at least one Dolby Digital audio track. Supported films studios include 20th Century Fox, Artisan Entertainment, DreamWorks, and Universal Pictures. D-Theater does have region code restrictions. There are 3 known regions; 1 for the USA, 2 for Japan, and 3 for South Korea. There has never been a D-Theater video release in region 2 or 3. Region code hacks for Japanese decks have been performed to support playback of US titles. The last film available was 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot;. This title was a surprise to many as there were no prior announcements nor any indication that the title was available. It was originally available only on JVC&#x27;s D-VHS store in late 2004 and no other distributor had it (not even Fox itself). A couple of weeks later they started trickling out to more distributors after much delay and confusion about its existence. &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; was announced to retailers as also being released on the same day as &quot;I, Robot&quot;, but Fox later announced that &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; was never shipped to retailers.

Most tapes have built-in copy protection mechanism (DTCP, also known as &quot;5c&quot;) (copy never) that disables copying via FireWire. HDNet productions and 2929 Entertainment via Magnolia Entertainment did provide some of their original content on D-VHS but without copy protection. Many of the tapes have an introduction by owner Mark Cuban encouraging the viewer to make copies of the program in order to help distribute them.

Additional tracks may be included on D-Theater in other sound formats such as DTS. However, only the newest D-VHS players, like the JVC HM-DH40000, HM-DH5U, HM-DT100U, and Marantz MV-8300, include alternate audio track capabilities.

== Compatibility ==

There are technical issues with compatibility between recordings from Mitsubishi and JVC D-VHS decks. PAL and NTSC recordings are also incompatible.

== Adoption ==
Very few models were available to the world market and sales of this format have been weak; correspondingly, prices remained high for both VCRs and media, contributing to low demand. In 2000, Sony arranged with JVC to manufacture D-VHS VCRs under the Sony label, marking one of the first collaborations between the two former rivals. The lack of consumer knowledge of D-VHS&#x27;s advantages and capabilities as well as input limitations led to its eventual demise. The introduction in 2006 of Blu-ray and HD-DVD rendered the format abandoned.

== Similar formats ==

There has been no small-format version of D-VHS equivalent to VHS-C; JVC, the originator of the format, chose to use MiniDV for its digital camcorder lines, and since 2005 has also expanded into tapeless camcorder designs based on hard drive storage (the Everio line). JVC does market the Digital-S format for professional use; while the tapes and technology used are superficially similar to D-VHS tapes, the underlying data format is based on the DV codec and the media formulation is drastically different. Sony&#x27;s MicroMV format uses the same codec as D-VHS. Therefore, D-VHS capture software can also be used to transfer MicroMV tapes.

<doc id="1289122" wikidata="Q2614533" url="?curid=1289122" title="British folk rock">
<text>British folk rock is a form of folk rock which developed in the United Kingdom from the mid 1960s, and was at its most significant in the 1970s. Though the merging of folk and rock music came from several sources, it is widely regarded that the success of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; by British band the Animals in 1964 was a catalyst, prompting Bob Dylan to &quot;go electric&quot;, in which, like the Animals, he brought folk and rock music together, from which other musicians followed. In the same year, the Beatles began incorporating overt folk influences into their music, most noticeably on their &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; album. The Beatles and other British Invasion bands, in turn, influenced the American band the Byrds, who released their recording of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; in April 1965, setting off the mid-1960s American folk rock movement. A number of British groups, usually those associated with the British folk revival, moved into folk rock in the mid-1960s, including the Strawbs, Pentangle, and Fairport Convention.

British folk rock was taken up and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man, to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives, and has been influential in countries with close cultural connections to Britain. It gave rise to the genre of folk punk. By the 1980s the genre was in steep decline in popularity, but survived and revived in significance, partly merging with the rock music and folk music cultures from which it originated. Some commentators have found a distinction in some British folk rock, where the musicians are playing traditional folk music with electric instruments rather than merging rock and folk music, and they distinguish this form of playing by calling it &quot;electric folk&quot;.

==History==

===Origins===
Though the merging of folk and rock music came from several sources, it is widely regarded that the success of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; by British band the Animals in 1964 was a catalyst, prompting Bob Dylan to go electric. In the same year, the Beatles began incorporating overt folk influences into their music, most noticeably on the song &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; from their &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; album. The Beatles and other British Invasion bands, in turn, influenced the Californian band the Byrds, who began playing folk-influenced material and Bob Dylan compositions with rock instrumentation. The Byrds&#x27; recording of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was released in April 1965 and reached #1 on the U.S. and UK singles charts, setting off the mid-1960s folk rock movement. The Beatles&#x27; late 1965 album, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, contained a number of songs influenced by the American folk rock boom, such as &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;. During this period, a number of electric bands began to play rock versions of folk songs and folk musicians used electric musical instruments to play their own songs, including Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in the summer of 1965.

Folk rock became an important genre among emerging English bands, particularly those in the London club scene towards the end of the 1960s. The skiffle movement, to which many English musicians, including the Beatles, owed their origins as performers, meant that they were already familiar with American folk music As they emulated the guitar and drum based format that had crystallised as the norm for rock music, these groups often turned to American folk and folk rock as the focus of their sound and inspiration. Among these groups from 1967 were Fairport Convention, who had enjoyed some modest mainstream success with three albums of material that was largely American in origin or style, before a radical change of direction in 1969 with their album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;, which came out of the encounter between American inspired folk rock and the products of the English folk revival.

The first English folk music revival had seen a huge effort to record and archive traditional English music by figures such as Cecil Sharp and Vaughan Williams in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The second revival in the period after the Second World War, built on this work and followed a similar movement in America, to which it was connected by individuals like Alan Lomax, who had fled to England in the era of McCarthyism. Like the American revival, it was often overtly left wing in its politics, but, led by such figures as Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd from the early 1950s, it also attempted to produce a distinctively English music that was an alternative to the American dominance of popular culture, which was, as they saw it, displacing the traditional music of an increasingly urbanised and industrialised working class. Most important among their responses were the foundation of folk clubs in major towns, starting with London where MacColl began the Ballads and Blues Club in 1953. These clubs were usually urban in location, but the songs sung in them often hearkened back to a rural pre-industrial past. In many ways this was the adoption of abandoned popular music by the middle classes. By the mid-1960s there were probably over 300 folk clubs in Britain, providing an important circuit for acts that performed traditional songs and tunes acoustically, where they could sustain a living by playing to a small but committed audience. This meant that there were, by the later 1960s, a group of performers with musical skill and knowledge of a wide variety of traditional songs and tunes.

A number of groups who were part of the folk revival experimented with electrification in the mid-1960s. These included the unrecorded efforts of Sweeney&#x27;s Men from Ireland, the jazz folk group Pentangle, who moved from purely acoustic instrumentation to introducing electric guitar on their later albums, Eclection, who released one album in 1968, and the Strawbs who developed from a bluegrass band into a &quot;progressive Byrds&quot; band by 1967. However, none provided a sustained or much emulated effort in this direction. Also products of the folk club circuit were Sandy Denny who joined Fairport Convention as a singer in 1968 and Dave Swarbrick, a fiddle player and session musician who reacted positively to the electric music he encountered while working with Fairport in 1969. The result was an extended interpretation of the song &quot;A Sailor&#x27;s Life&quot;, which was released on their album &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot;. This encounter sparked the interest of Ashley Hutchings who began research in the English Folk Dance and Song Society&#x27;s library; the result was the band&#x27;s seminal &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; (1969) which combined traditional songs and tunes with some written by members of the band in a similar style, all played on a combination of electric instruments including Swarbrick&#x27;s amplified fiddle, setting the template for British folk rock.

===Heyday 1969–76===
The rapid expansion of British folk rock that followed in the wake of &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; in the 1970s came mainly from three sources. First were existing folk performers who now &#x27;electrified&#x27;, including Mr. Fox, formed around the acoustic duo Bob and Carole Pegg, and Pentangle, who having previously recorded largely without electrification, produced a fourth album of entirely traditional material, &quot;Cruel Sister&quot;, in 1970, performed very much in the British folk rock mould. Similarly, Swarbrick&#x27;s former playing partner, Martin Carthy, joined Steeleye Span in 1971 to the astonishment of many in the folk music world. Five Hand Reel, a band formed out of the remnants of Spencer&#x27;s Feat, proved to be one of the more successful and influential folk rock bands. Releasing four albums with Topic/RCA records, they were popular in Europe, where they gave most of their performances. Unlike the &#x27;English&#x27; genre of folk tunes prevalent in the other popular bands, Five Hand Reel performed Scots and Irish songs and won &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s &quot;Folk Album of the Year&quot; in 1975.

Second were groupings created directly by the members or former members of Fairport Convention, which can be seen as the nexus from which a family of organisations or performers emerged. Sandy Denny&#x27;s short-lived group Fotheringay was one of these and Steeleye Span was another, the latter formed as a traditionally focussed, but essentially electric outfit, by Ashley Hutchings after his departure from Fairport in late 1969. He left Steeleye Span after three albums and eventually formed the Albion Country Band, later the Albion Band, which broke up in 2002. The Albion Band in turn spawned one of the most musically talented British folk rock groups of the 1980s Home Service, whose third album &quot;Alright Jack&quot; (1985) is often seen as representing another artistic highpoint for the genre.

A much smaller group of English bands were formed in emulation of existing folk rock bands. Most often the model seems to have been Steeleye Span, as it was for the Cambridge group Spriguns of Tolgus, the Northumbrian band Hedgehog Pie and the Oyster Band, who started as the unpromising Fiddler&#x27;s Dram in 1978. Fiddler&#x27;s Dram were often dismissed as &quot;one hit wonders&quot; for their single &quot;Day Trip to Bangor&quot;, which peaked at no 3 in the UK and for their clear status as &quot;Steeleye Span soundalikes&quot;. What was remarkable is that they proved to have a singer-songwriter of genuine talent in Cathy Lesurf, and after she had left for the Albion Band in 1980 the remaining members regrouped as the Oyster Band (latterly Oysterband), an increasingly heavy and politically aware folk rock unit who produced some of the best work in the genre in the 1980s and 1990s, merging into the developing folk punk and independent scenes.

===Decline and survival 1977–85===
For a time electric folk threatened to break through to the mainstream, peaking in the early-to-mid-1970s when Steeleye Span had a Christmas Top 20 hit single (&quot;Gaudete&quot;) in 1973 and another Top 5 hit in 1975 (&quot;All Around My Hat&quot;). The album of the same name was their most commercially successful, reaching no. 5 in the UK album chart in the same year. By comparison Fairport Convention released few singles and made very little impact on the British charts, although their albums sold well in the early 1970s. &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; reached no. 17 in 1969 and a later album, &quot;Angel Delight&quot; made the Top 10 in 1971. Most of their career, from that point until they initially disbanded in 1979, was one of declining profile and sales.

The same was generally true of other electric folk outfits. The late 1970s and early 1980s were a time to either abandon the genre or fight a losing struggle for survival. The reason is often said to be the rise of punk rock, which reached a peak in 1977. It changed the ethos of popular music, overturning certainties about musicianship and songwriting and had no greater target than the old fashioned folk musicians of the preceding generation. All popular music trends have a generational problem as their audiences grow and might not be replaced, but for folk rock the discontinuity was very acute. One result was a further hybridisation with the development of folk punk among younger acts in the later 1970s, some of which, like the Pogues and The Levellers, achieved some mainstream success. The early 1980s were the nadir of electric folk, when, in contrast to the mid-1970s only the Albion Band (with the associated Home Service) and the Oysterband remained as major exponents of the genre and this was perhaps their least productive period, although in part, at least, this was due to lack of major record company interest in the genre. Folk-rock has never been a major revenue earner for record companies, even in its 1970s heyday. As a consequence of this lack of interest the three Home Service albums released between 1984 and 1986 came out on three different independent labels (Jigsaw, Coda and Making Waves), which further dented their commercial prospects.

===Resurgence 1985–present===
In the later 1980s, things began to look much more positive for the genre. Despite formally disbanding in 1979, Fairport Convention staged what were initially called &quot;reunion&quot; concerts annually from 1980, which eventually evolved into the Cropredy Festival (&quot;Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention&quot;) which remains (in 2022) a mainstay of the U.K. summer festival calendar and regularly attracts up to 20,000 attendees, by no means all of whom are Fairport Convention fans. When the band reformed in 1985 they were able to embark on increasingly lengthy and successful tours and produce a series of highly regarded albums. The reason for this recording revival was partly because they abandoned the mainstream record business, instead focusing on growing their own audience and producing records independently on their own labels (Woodworm and Matty Grooves), ironically a development which the punk and post-punk era had helped to accelerate.

The Albion Band survived initially by becoming involved in theatre productions and, from 1993, by downsizing to a smaller acoustic outfit that could play the still extensive network of folk clubs and other smaller venues. This move was also significant in indicating the way in which electric folk personnel had become assimilated into the folk revival. Almost all the members of Fairport Convention have toured the folk club circuit solo or in smaller units and the line up at Cropredy includes as many acoustic acts as electric.

In 1980, Steeleye Span&#x27;s &quot;Sails of Silver&quot; took a decisive move away from traditional songs. It was a commercial failure and their last album for six years as they became a part-time touring band. However, in 1986 they produced &quot;Back in Line&quot; and since then, despite several line-up changes, they have continued to perform and have recorded eight more albums.

Some bands like Stone Angel and Jack the Lad, who had disbanded in the 1970s, had reformed and resumed a recording or touring career.

===Timeline===

===Impact on English rock music===
Hard rock and progressive rock bands such as Led Zeppelin and Jethro Tull incorporated elements of folk music in their music, though they are not considered part of the folk rock movement. Led Zeppelin had shared a stage with Fairport Convention at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music in 1970. Robert Plant and Jimmy Page&#x27;s interest in the genre was first evident in the recording of &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; a traditional ballad on &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; (1970), which stands out among their usual output of blues orientated rock. At this time they also wrote the ballad &quot;Poor Tom&quot; which would surface on &quot;Coda&quot; (1982). It is more subtly manifested in their most famous album &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; (1971), which contained elements of both American folk rock and English electric folk on &#x27;Stairway to Heaven&#x27; and most obviously on &#x27;The Battle of Evermore&#x27;, on which Sandy Denny had the distinction of being the only person ever to be invited to do guest vocals on a Led Zeppelin album. These influences would also appear on later albums, but reduced as the band returned to a hard rock sound from &quot;Presence&quot; (1976) onwards.

As Led Zeppelin moved away from electric folk, another long term survivor of the British blues movement, Jethro Tull, began to move towards it. Ian Anderson had produced Steeleye Span&#x27;s album &quot;Now We Are Six&quot; in 1974 and first demonstrated a clear interest in more traditional sounds on &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; (1975), but it was in 1977 with the release of &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; (1977) that Anderson took the band into electric folk territory. All the songs on the album focused on rural life and, in addition to the normal electronic instruments and flute of the band, used mandolin, lute and a pipe organ. Two tracks, &#x27;Hunting Girl&#x27; and particularly &#x27;Velvet Green&#x27; followed the form of erotic folk ballads, much suited to Anderson&#x27;s song writing interests. Two more albums followed in a similar vein: &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; (1978) and &quot;Stormwatch&quot; (1979) to form a loose folk rock trilogy, before Anderson moved into more electronic territory at the beginning of the 1980s. Ironically it was at this point that Dave Pegg of Fairport Convention would be the first of several members of that band to join Jethro Tull.

===Electric and progressive folk===
Progressive folk developed in Britain in the mid-1960s partly as an attempt to elevate the artistic quality of the folk genre, but also as a response to diverse influences, often combining acoustic folk instruments with jazz, blues and world music. As a result, it was already established in Britain, albeit a difficult to define and varied subgenre, before the advent of electric folk at the end of the 1960s. It can be seen as including performers such as Donovan, the Incredible String Band, Pentangle, Strawbs, Nick Drake, Roy Harper, John Martyn and the original Tyrannosaurus Rex. Some of this, particularly the Incredible String Band, has been seen as developing into the further subgenre of psych or psychedelic folk.

The advent of electric folk had profound effects on this developing strand of the folk genre. First, many existing acts, having avoided the American model of folk rock electrification from about 1965 now adopted it, most obviously Pentangle, Strawbs and acoustic duo Tyrannosaurus Rex which became the electric combo T-Rex. It also pushed progressive folk towards more traditional material. Acoustic performers Dando Shaft and Amazing Blondel, both beginning about this time, are examples of this trend.

Examples of bands that remained firmly on the border between progressive folk and progressive rock are the short lived Comus and, more successfully, Renaissance, who combined folk and rock with elements of classical music.

While progressive folk as a genre continued into the late 1960s, it was overshadowed by electric folk and progressive rock, arguably, later to emerge in a new form.

==Derivatives==

===Medieval folk rock===

From about 1970 a number of performers inspired by electric folk, particularly in England, Germany and Brittany, adopted medieval and renaissance music as a basis for their music, in contrast to the early modern and 19th century ballada that dominated the output of Fairport Convention. This followed the trend explored by Steeleye Span, and exemplified by their 1972 album &quot;Below the Salt&quot;. Acts in this area included Gryphon, Gentle Giant and Third Ear Band. In Germany Ougenweide, originally formed in 1970 as an acoustic folk group, opted to draw exclusively on High German medieval music when they electrified, setting the agenda for future German electric folk. In Brittany, as part of the Celtic rock movement, medieval music was focused on by bands like Ripaille from 1977 and Saga de Ragnar Lodbrock from 1979. However, by the end of the 1970s almost all of these performers had either disbanded or moved, like Gentle Giant and Gryphon, into the developing area of progressive rock. One remaining but notable exponent of medieval folk rock is Ritchie Blackmore with Blackmore&#x27;s Night.

===Celtic rock===

Initially Celtic rock replicated electric folk, but naturally replaced the element of English traditional music with its own folk music. It was rapidly evident in all areas of the Celtic nations and regions surrounding England, as Ireland, Scotland, Isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany all saw the adoption and adaptation of the electric folk model. Through at least the first half of the 1970s, as Celtic rock held close to folk roots, with its repertoire drawing heavily on traditional Celtic fiddle and harp tunes and even traditional vocal styles, but making use of rock band levels of amplification and percussion it can be considered part of the electric folk movement. However, as it developed into new derivatives and hybrids, including Celtic punk, Celtic metal, and other sorts of Celtic fusion, the initial electric folk pattern began to dissipate.

===Folk punk===
In the mid-1980s a new rebirth of English folk began, this time fusing folk forms with energy and political aggression derived from punk rock. Leaders included The Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang, Oysterband, Billy Bragg and The Pogues. Folk dance music also became popular in the 1980s, with the English Country Blues Band and Tiger Moth. The decade later saw the use of reggae with English folk music by the band Edward II &amp; the Red Hot Polkas, especially on their seminal &quot;Let&#x27;s Polkasteady&quot; from 1987.

===Folk metal===
In a process strikingly similar to the origins of electric folk in the 1960s, the English thrash metal band Skyclad added violins from a session musician on several tracks for their 1990 début album &quot;The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth&quot;. When this was well received they adopted a full-time fiddle player and moved towards a signature folk and jig style leading them to be credited as the pioneers of folk metal. This directly inspired the Dublin-based band Cruachan to use traditional Irish music in creating the Celtic metal subgenre. Attempts have been made elsewhere to replicate this process with examples ranging from the Middle Eastern folk music of Orphaned Land, the Baltic folk music of Skyforger and the Scandinavian folk music of Korpiklaani. In Germany this trend is more closely associated with the neo-medieval music known as medieval metal.

==Festivals==

Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention (previously &quot;Cropredy Festival&quot;) has been held every year since 1980 near Cropredy, a village five miles north of Banbury, Oxfordshire and attracts up to 20,000 fans. It remains one of the key events in the UK folk festival calendar.

After holding a successful open-air concert at Kentwell Hall, Suffolk in 2005, Steeleye Span decided to hold their own annual festival, known as Spanfest.

Other, more traditional, folk festivals (Shrewsbury, Towersey, Cambridge and Sidmouth, to name but four) now routinely host performances by exponents of the folk-rock genre.

==Electric folk==

When English bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s defined themselves as &#x27;electric folk&#x27; they were making a distinction with the already existing &#x27;folk rock&#x27;. Folk rock was (to them) what they had already been producing: American or American style singer-songwriter material played on rock instruments, as undertaken by Bob Dylan and the Byrds from 1965. They drew the distinction because they were focusing on indigenous (in this case English) songs and tunes. This is not to say that all the proponents of electric folk totally abandoned American material, or that it would not be represented in their own compositions, but their work would be characterised by the use of traditional English songs and tunes and the creation of new songs in that style, using the format and instruments of a rock band with the occasional addition of more traditional instruments.

The result of this hybridisation was an exchange of specific features drawn from traditional music and rock music. These have been defined as including:

Traditional music:
* Lyrics
* Tunes (including ornamentation)
* The drone (cf. bagpipes), but usually on a guitar or bass
* Use of some acoustic instruments
* Use of traditional rhythms; for example, an eight-beat rhythm of 3+3+2 with the stress on the first, fourth, and seventh beats, as in Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;, while not unusual precludes the standard rock backbeat.
* Blending of multiple songs in the traditional music style: often a short instrumental piece is inserted as an instrumental in a longer lyrical piece (i.e. a piece with vocals), both in traditional music and Electric folk

Rock music:
* Rhythm (specifically the backbeat)
* The hook
* Ostinati (plural of ostinato), a melodic and/or rhythmic figure that is persistently repeated throughout a piece or a section of a piece
* Use of some electric instrument
* The tempo of some songs may be altered well beyond the traditional boundaries
* Key changes may be added

Not all of these features are found in every song. For example, electric folk groups, while &quot;predominantly&quot; using traditional material as their source for lyrics and tunes, occasionally write their own (much as traditional musicians do).

<text>John Clyn, O.F.M. (), of the Friars Minor, Kilkenny, was a 14th-century Irish friar and chronicler who lived at the time of the Black Death.

==Background==
Clyn was probably born in Leinster some years prior to 1300, possibly at Baile a Clinn/Clyn&#x27;s town/Clintstown, in the parish of Conahy, some six and a half miles north-west of Kilkenny. The surname Clyn is found in Somerset and Bristol, which may have been where his Anglo-Norman ancestors originated.

==Career==
Bishop James Ussher stated, possibly in error, that Clyn was a doctor of the Franciscan Order. This statement may be a presumption as it has no supporting evidence. Clyn was well educated, though just where he received his education is unknown. He may have attended the university at Dublin, while Oxford and Cambridge remain more distant possibilities.

Clyn is recorded as the Guardian of the friary of Carrick in 1336; Bernadette Williams believes that he would have been about fifty at that time (&quot;around the same age as his hero Fulk de la Freigne&quot;), as someone mature would have been needed to hold that post.

Clyn may have attended the General Chapter of the Friars Minor at Marseilles in 1346. At some point between 1336 and 1348 he moved to Kilkenny.

John Clyn wrote a diary, or journal, about the Black Death, which has become a key primary source on the plague. He left blank pages for those who wanted to &quot;finish the work.&quot;

He was still alive after 17 June 1349, his last entry in his annals being a eulogy for Fulk de la Freigne. It is unknown whether Clyn perished from the disease. Though the Black Death persisted in Ireland until 1350, Clyn may have survived it. If this is the case, he may have ceased writing &quot;...because of the death of his friend, and perhaps patron, Fulk de la Freigne.&quot;

==&quot;The Annals of Ireland&quot;==
In an effort to identify Clyn&#x27;s purpose in writing his annals, Bernadette Williams states:
Indeed, the latter family are mentioned fulsomely in his annals.

As a person &quot;from a military and chivalric background... he displayed an acceptance of the military situation on the ground&quot; but abhorred &quot;treachery and unprovoked violence.&quot;

Clyn would be unknown as the author had he not identified himself in his entry on the Black Death.

In 2007 an edition of the annals of Friar Clyn was translated into English by Dr. Bernadette Williams.

<doc id="1289185" wikidata="Q4698543" url="?curid=1289185" title="Aircraft emergency frequency">
<text>The aircraft emergency frequency (also known in the USA as Guard) is a frequency used on the aircraft band reserved for emergency communications for aircraft in distress. The frequencies are 121.5 MHz for civilian, also known as International Air Distress (IAD), International Aeronautical Emergency Frequency, or VHF Guard, and 243.0 MHz—the second harmonic of VHF guard—for military use, also known as Military Air Distress (MAD), NATO Combined Distress and Emergency Frequency, or UHF Guard. Earlier emergency locator transmitters (ELTs / EPIRBs) used the guard frequencies to transmit. As of February 1, 2009 satellite monitoring of the 121.5 and 243 MHz ELT (EPIRB) frequencies ceased, whereas an additional band from 406.0 to 406.1 MHz is now used exclusively by modern emergency locator transmitters (EPIRB).

==History==
The choice of 121.5 MHz was made by ICAO in conjunction with ARINC and the ITU.

==Monitoring==

In the United States, the emergency frequency is monitored by most air traffic control towers, FSS services, national air traffic control centers, military air defense and other flight and emergency services, as well as by many commercial aircraft. The notice to airmen FDC 4/4386 requires &quot;…all aircraft operating in United States National Airspace, if capable, shall maintain a listening watch on VHF GUARD 121.5 or UHF 243.0.&quot;

In the UK, 121.5 MHz is monitored by the Royal Air Force Distress and Diversion cells (known as &quot;D&amp;D&quot;) at the London Terminal Control Centre and the Shanwick Oceanic Control, from a nationwide network of antennas. Depending on the aircraft&#x27;s altitude and location, the personnel in the centres may be able to use triangulation to determine its exact position which can be useful to the pilot if the aircraft is lost or &quot;temporarily unsure of position&quot;.

==Use==

Both guard frequencies can be used by any aircraft in distress or experiencing an emergency and in addition it can be used by air traffic control to warn aircraft if they are about to fly into restricted or prohibited airspace.

Guard frequencies can be used for distress calls, such as Mayday calls, and urgency calls, such as Pan-pan calls.

Aircraft will also be contacted on 121.5 MHz when intercepted by air defence aircraft, to ask for identification and intentions and to pass on instructions.

=== Misuse ===

ICAO Annex 10, Volume V, § 4.1.3.1.1 states &quot;the emergency channel (121.5 MHz) shall be used only for genuine emergency purposes&quot;.

A misuse of the frequency can result in punishment. In the United States, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules prohibit false distress calls and superfluous communications. If the FCC Enforcement Bureau identifies an individual breaking these rules, they can be subject to a fine of up to $19,246 for a single violation and up to $144,344 for an ongoing violation. FCC may also confiscate radio equipment and file for criminal charges.

In the United Kingdom, pilots may make &quot;Practice PAN&quot; or &quot;Training Fix&quot; calls. Practice Mayday calls are not permitted.

==Locating beacons==
Older emergency locator transmitters transmit on 121.5 MHz in case of impact. Newer ELTs transmit on 406 MHz, with a low power beacon on 121.5 MHz for local homing. Satellites listen for the signals and alert local personnel to the emergency, and the beacon allows search and rescue to find the scene of the accident faster. Beacons operating at 406 MHz are encoded, allowing the vessel of origin to be determined and false alarms to be quickly verified. Satellite support for the 121.5 MHz–only (and 243 MHz) versions was discontinued in early 2009.

<text>Wolfgang Petritsch (born 26 August 1947) is an Austrian diplomat who served as the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1999 to 2002.

==Early life and studies==
Petritsch was born to a Carinthian Slovene family in Klagenfurt; he grew up in Glainach in a mixed Slovene/German-speaking environment. Besides his native tongues, he speaks English, French, and Serbo-Croatian.

Petritsch studied history, German studies, political science and law at the University of Vienna, where he obtained a PhD in 1972. He was also a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. From 1977 to 1983 he was secretary and press officer to Federal Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, about whom he published a biography in 2011.

==Diplomatic career==
After one year at the Austrian Mission to the OECD in Paris, between 1984 and 1992 Petritsch served as Director of the Austrian Press and Information Service Agency in the United States and as Minister Plenipotentiary to Austria&#x27;s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York. In 1992–1994 he served as Acting Head of the Department for Multilateral Economic Co-operation in the Austrian foreign ministry, as well as in the latter year as Head of Department for Information on European Affairs in the Federal Chancellery, supervising the Austrian Federal Government&#x27;s information campaign on Austria&#x27;s accession to the EU. Between 1995 and 1997 he headed the Department for International Relations of the City of Vienna.

From 1997 to 1999 he was Austrian Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the same period, between October 1998 and July 1999, he also served as the European Union Special Representative for Kosovo. In such a vest he chaired the EU negotiating teams in February and March 1999 at the Kosovo peace talks in Rambouillet and Paris.

Petritsch served between August 1999 and May 2002 as the international High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHR).

In 1999–2001 he was also chair of the Succession Commission for the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in charge of distributing the public assets and liabilities among the successor states (Vienna Agreement, June 2001).

In the 2002 Austrian elections, Petritsch ran with Alfred Gusenbauer&#x27;s SPÖ, as prospective Foreign Minister. Already before the ballot, he was appointed Austria&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, on which post he later returned at the beginning of 2008.

In September 2003, Petritsch, as Austria&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office at Geneva, to the WTO and to the Conference on Disarmament; he was appointed President of the Ottawa Treaty&#x27;s First Review Conference, or &quot;Nairobi Summit on a Mine Free World&quot; taking place in Kenya in 2004. 
In 2004–2005 he chaired the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and was in charge of its reform.

After leaving Geneva, Petritsch went to Paris as Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Austria to the OECD until 2013.

Since November 2021 Petritsch is part of the advisory board of the Austrian Service Abroad.

==Other positions==
From 2005 to 2014 Petritsch chaired the Center for European Integration Studies (CEIS) in Geneva. 
Since 2007 he is President of the Paul Lazarsfeld Gesellschaft, Vienna
From 2008 to 2013 he served as chair of the board of the European Cultural Foundation in Amsterdam.
Since 2009 he is President of the Herbert Kelman Institute, Vienna.

<doc id="1289214" wikidata="Q4984826" url="?curid=1289214" title="Buddy Burner">
<text>A Buddy Burner is a simple stove made from a can and part of a corrugated paper box. It is usually fueled by paraffin wax but other fuels, such as boiled butter, animal fat or diesel fuel, can be used.
It is usually used for cooking but can also provide heat.

The most common type of buddy burner is made from a tuna or cat food can because of the low profile. The corrugated paper is cut into a strip as wide as the can is tall then rolled into a tight coil and placed in the can. The can is then filled with fuel (if fueled with paraffin wax it is first melted) leaving enough of the paper above the fuel to act as a wick. 

==Benefits==
Using paraffin wax as a fuel has two advantages. First, when the burner cools the wax hardens making it convenient to keep in the burner for later use. Second, it is safe to refuel the burner while it is operating since placing solid paraffin wax on top of the burning stove involves no danger of the fresh fuel igniting explosively.

Since oxygen is necessary for combustion, holes may need to be punched around the top of the can to allow air to enter, and to provide a way for combustion gases to escape around the pot.

==Safety precautions==
Modern canning techniques now employ coatings that may produce toxic fumes when burning and can cause metal fume fever, and care must therefore be taken to ensure that cans used for burning are uncoated plain metal. Such coatings are usually used for tomatoes and other acidic foods.

Candles are usually made of paraffin wax and can be melted to put into a Buddy Burner. However, candles or paraffin wax blocks should be melted in a double boiler so that they cannot catch fire.

<text>Oakdale Park is a former baseball park that was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==History==
This field was home to the Philadelphia Athletics professional baseball team in the first season of the American Association, 1882. The site of the park had been used for amateur baseball since the Civil War. It was used from 1877 to 1881 by the Olympic Ball Club of Philadelphia.

The 1882 Athletics played at the park, bounded by Huntingdon Street (north), 11th Street (east), Cumberland Street (south), and 12th Street (west) in the West Kensington neighborhood. The Athletics played 39 regular-season games at the park, compiling a 21–18 record. The franchise relocated to Jefferson Street Grounds in 1883. 

Oakdale Park was sold shortly thereafter and torn down. Philadelphia Ball Park was built several blocks west of this site, five years later.

<text>Matt Blaze is an American researcher who focuses on the areas of secure systems, cryptography, and trust management. He is currently the McDevitt Chair of Computer Science and Law at Georgetown University, and is on the board of directors of the Tor Project.

==Work==
Blaze received his PhD in computer science from Princeton University.

In 1992, while working for AT&amp;T, Blaze implemented a strong cryptographic package known as &quot;CFS&quot;, the Cryptographic File System, for Unix, since ported to Linux. CFS uses Network File System as its transport mechanism, allowing users to encrypt selected directory hierarchies, but mount them unencrypted after providing the key. In November, 1993, he presented a paper on this project, &quot;A Cryptographic File System for Unix&quot;, at the 1st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security. Blaze also published a paper &quot;Key Management in an Encrypting File System&quot;, in the Proceedings USENIX Summer 1994 Technical Conference.

In the early 1990s, at the height of the &quot;crypto war&quot;, Blaze was a participant in the Cypherpunks mailing list and in 1994, he found a critical weakness in the wiretapping mechanisms of the Clipper chip. 
His paper, &quot;Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard&quot;, pointed out that the Clipper&#x27;s escrow system had a serious vulnerability: a brute-force attack could allow the Clipper chip to be used as an encryption device, while disabling the key escrow capability. Later during this time, he was one of the authors of a seminal paper on calculating secure key lengths.

After leaving Bell, Blaze was an associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2018. Blaze has noted a long-term conflict with the university&#x27;s locksmith over his master key &amp; safecracking publications. He then joined the faculty at Georgetown University, on a joint appointment at Georgetown Law and the department of computer science.

In 2015, Blaze was part of a team of proponents that included Steven M. Bellovin, J. Alex Halderman, Nadia Heninger, and Andrea M. Matwyshyn who successfully proposed a security research exemption to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

In July 2016, the complete board of the Tor Project resigned and announced a new board, including Matt Blaze.

In 2018, crypto Visa card company Monaco paid Blaze an undisclosed amount for the rights to the domain Crypto.com. Blaze had registered the domain in 1993 and sellers have estimated that the value of the domain was US$5–10 million.

<doc id="1289222" wikidata="Q2065731" url="?curid=1289222" title="The Dream of Gerontius">
<text>The Dream of Gerontius, Op. 38, is a work for voices and orchestra in two parts composed by Edward Elgar in 1900, to text from the poem by John Henry Newman. It relates the journey of a pious man&#x27;s soul from his deathbed to his judgment before God and settling into Purgatory. Elgar disapproved of the use of the term &quot;oratorio&quot; for the work (and the term occurs nowhere in the score), though his wishes are not always followed. The piece is widely regarded as Elgar&#x27;s finest choral work, and some consider it his masterpiece.

The work was composed for the Birmingham Music Festival of 1900; the first performance took place on 3 October 1900, in Birmingham Town Hall. It was badly performed at the premiere, but later performances in Germany revealed its stature. In the first decade after its premiere, the Roman Catholic theology in Newman&#x27;s poem caused difficulties in getting the work performed in Anglican cathedrals, and a revised text was used for performances at the Three Choirs Festival until 1910.

==History==

Edward Elgar was not the first composer to think about setting John Henry Newman&#x27;s poem &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;. Dvořák had considered it fifteen years earlier, and had discussions with Newman, before abandoning the idea. Elgar knew the poem well; he had owned a copy since at least 1885, and in 1889 he was given another as a wedding present. This copy contained handwritten transcriptions of extensive notes that had been made by General Gordon, and Elgar is known to have thought of the text in musical terms for several years. Throughout the 1890s, Elgar had composed several large-scale works for the regular festivals that were a key part of Britain&#x27;s musical life. In 1898, based on his growing reputation, he was asked to write a major work for the 1900 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival. He was unable to start work on the poem that he knew so well until the autumn of 1899, and did so only after first considering a different subject.

Composition proceeded quickly. Elgar and August Jaeger, his editor at the publisher Novello, exchanged frequent, sometimes daily, letters, which show how Jaeger helped in shaping the work, and in particular the climactic depiction of the moment of judgment. By the time Elgar had completed the work and Novello had printed it, there were only three months to the premiere. The Birmingham chorus, all amateurs, struggled to master Elgar&#x27;s complex, demanding and somewhat revolutionary work. Matters were made worse by the sudden death of the chorus master Charles Swinnerton Heap and his replacement by William Stockley, an elderly musician who found the music beyond him. The conductor of the premiere, Hans Richter, received a copy of the full score only on the eve of the first orchestral rehearsal. The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were Marie Brema, Edward Lloyd and Harry Plunket Greene. The first performance was, famously, a near disaster. The choir could not sing the music adequately, and two of the three soloists were in poor voice. Elgar was deeply upset at the debacle, telling Jaeger, &quot;I have allowed my heart to open once – it is now shut against every religious feeling &amp; every soft, gentle impulse for ever.&quot; However, many of the critics could see past the imperfect realisation and the work became established in Britain once it had had its first London performance on 6 June 1903, at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral.

Shortly after the premiere, the German conductor and chorus master Julius Buths made a German translation of the text and arranged a successful performance in Düsseldorf on 19 December 1901. Elgar was present, and he wrote &quot;It completely bore out my idea of the work: the chorus was very fine&quot;. Buths presented it in Düsseldorf again on 19 May 1902 in conjunction with the Lower Rhenish Music Festival. The soloists included Muriel Foster and tenor Ludwig Wüllner, and Elgar was again in the audience, being called to the stage twenty times to receive the audience&#x27;s applause. This was the performance that finally convinced Elgar for the first time that he had written a truly satisfying work. Buths&#x27;s festival co-director Richard Strauss was impressed enough by what he heard that at a post-concert banquet he said: &quot;I drink to the success and welfare of the first English progressive musician, Meister Elgar&quot;. This greatly pleased Elgar, who considered Strauss to be &quot;the greatest genius of the age&quot;.

The strong Roman Catholicism of the work gave rise to objections in some influential British quarters; some Anglican clerics insisted that for performances in English cathedrals Elgar should modify the text to tone down the Roman Catholic references. There was no Anglican objection to Newman&#x27;s words in general: Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s setting of his &quot;Lead, Kindly Light&quot;, for example, was sung at Westminster Abbey in 1904. Disapproval was reserved for the doctrinal aspects of &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; repugnant to Anglicans, such as Purgatory. Elgar was unable to resist the suggested bowdlerisation, and in the ten years after the premiere the work was given at the Three Choirs Festival with an expurgated text. The Dean of Gloucester refused admission to the work until 1910. This attitude lingered until the 1930s, when the Dean of Peterborough banned the work from the cathedral. Elgar was also faced with many people&#x27;s assumption that he would use the standard hymn tunes for the sections of the poem that had already been absorbed into Anglican hymn books: &quot;Firmly I believe and truly&quot;, and &quot;Praise to the Holiest in the Height&quot;.
&quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; received its US premiere on 23 March 1903 at the Auditorium Theatre, Chicago, with Evan Williams as Gerontius, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Harrison M. Wild. It was given three days later in Carnegie Hall, New York, with Ada Crossley, Ellison van Hoose and David Bispham, conducted by Frank Damrosch. It was performed in Sydney, in 1903. The first performance in Vienna was in 1905; the Paris premiere was in 1906; and by 1911 the work received its Canadian premiere in Toronto under the baton of the composer. In 1997 it received its Turkish premiere by the BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, under the baton of Leonard Slatkin.

In the first decades after its composition leading performers of the tenor part included Gervase Elwes and John Coates, and Louise Kirkby Lunn, Elena Gerhardt and Julia Culp were admired as the Angel. Later singers associated with the work include Muriel Foster, Clara Butt, Kathleen Ferrier, and Janet Baker as the Angel, and Heddle Nash, Steuart Wilson, Tudor Davies and Richard Lewis as Gerontius.

The work has come to be generally regarded as Elgar&#x27;s finest choral composition. The &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; rates it as &quot;one of his three or four finest works&quot;, and the authors of &quot;The Record Guide&quot;, writing in 1956 when Elgar&#x27;s music was comparatively neglected, said, &quot;Anyone who doubts the fact of Elgar&#x27;s genius should take the first opportunity of hearing &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, which remains his masterpiece, as it is his largest and perhaps most deeply felt work.&quot; In the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Michael Kennedy writes, &quot;[T]he work has become as popular with British choral societies as &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Elijah&quot;, although its popularity overseas did not survive 1914. Many regard it as Elgar&#x27;s masterpiece. ... It is unquestionably the greatest British work in the oratorio form, although Elgar was right in believing that it could not accurately be classified as oratorio or cantata.&quot;

==Synopsis==

Newman&#x27;s poem tells the story of a soul&#x27;s journey through death, and provides a meditation on the unseen world of Roman Catholic theology. Gerontius (a name derived from the Greek word &quot;geron&quot;, &quot;old man&quot;) is a devout Everyman. Elgar&#x27;s setting uses most of the text of the first part of the poem, which takes place on Earth, but omits many of the more meditative sections of the much longer, otherworldly second part, tightening the narrative flow.

In the first part, we hear Gerontius as a dying man of faith, by turns fearful and hopeful, but always confident. A group of friends (also called &quot;assistants&quot; in the text) joins him in prayer and meditation. He passes in peace, and a priest, with the assistants, sends him on his way with a valediction. In the second part, Gerontius, now referred to as &quot;The Soul&quot;, awakes in a place apparently without space or time, and becomes aware of the presence of his guardian angel, who expresses joy at the culmination of his task (Newman conceived the Angel as male; Elgar gives the part to a female singer, but retains the references to the angel as male). After a long dialogue, they journey towards the judgment throne.

They safely pass a group of demons, and encounter choirs of angels, eternally praising God for His grace and forgiveness. The Angel of the Agony pleads with Jesus to spare the souls of the faithful. Finally Gerontius glimpses God and is judged in a single moment. The Guardian Angel lowers Gerontius into the soothing lake of Purgatory, with a final benediction and promise of a re-awakening to glory.

==Music==
===Forces===
The work calls for a large orchestra of typical late Romantic proportions, double chorus with semichorus, and usually three soloists. Gerontius is sung by a tenor, and the Angel is a mezzo-soprano. The Priest&#x27;s part is written for a baritone, while the Angel of the Agony is more suited to a bass; as both parts are short they are usually sung by the same performer, although some performances assign different singers for the two parts.

The choir plays several roles: attendants and friends, demons, Angelicals (women only) and Angels, and souls in Purgatory. They are employed at different times as a single chorus in four parts, or as a double chorus in eight parts or antiphonally. The semichorus is used for music of a lighter texture; usually in performance they are composed of a few members of the main chorus; however, Elgar himself preferred to have the semi-chorus placed near the front of the stage.

The required instrumentation comprises two flutes (II doubling piccolo), two oboes and cor anglais, two clarinets in B and A and bass clarinet, two bassoons and contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani plus three percussion parts, harp, organ, and strings. Elgar called for an additional harp if possible, plus three additional trumpets (and any available percussionists) to reinforce the climax in Part II, just before Gerontius&#x27;s vision of God.

===Form===
Each of the two parts is divided into distinct sections, but differs from the traditional oratorio in that the music continues without significant breaks. Elgar did not call the work an oratorio, and disapproved when other people used the term for it. Part I is approximately 35 minutes long and Part II is approximately 60 minutes.

Part I:
# Prelude
# Jesu, Maria – I am near to death
# Rouse thee, my fainting soul
# Sanctus fortis, sanctus Deus
# Proficiscere, anima Christiana

Part II:
# I went to sleep
# It is a member of that family
# But hark! upon my sense comes a fierce hubbub
# I see not those false spirits
# But hark! a grand mysterious harmony
# Thy judgment now is near
# I go before my judge
# Softly and gently, dearly-ransomed soul

====Part I====
The work begins with an orchestral prelude, which presents the most important motifs. In a detailed analysis, Elgar&#x27;s friend and editor August Jaeger identified and named these themes, in line with their functions in the work.

Gerontius sings a prayer, knowing that life is leaving him and giving voice to his fear, and asks for his friends to pray with him. For much of the soloist&#x27;s music, Elgar writes in a style that switches between exactly notated, fully accompanied recitative, and arioso phrases, lightly accompanied. The chorus adds devotional texts in four-part fugal writing. Gerontius&#x27;s next utterance is a full-blown aria &quot;Sanctus fortis&quot;, a long &quot;credo&quot; that eventually returns to expressions of pain and fear. Again, in a mixture of conventional chorus and recitative, the friends intercede for him. Gerontius, at peace, submits, and the priest recites the blessing &quot;Go forth upon thy journey, Christian soul!&quot; (a translation of the litany &quot;Ordo Commendationis Animae&quot;). This leads to a long chorus for the combined forces, ending Part I.

====Part II====
In a complete change of mood, Part II begins with a simple four-note phrase for the violas which introduces a gentle, rocking theme for the strings. This section is in triple time, as is much of the second part. The Soul&#x27;s music expresses wonder at its new surroundings, and when the Angel is heard, he expresses quiet exultation at the climax of his task. They converse in an extended duet, again combining recitative with pure sung sections. Increasingly busy music heralds the appearance of the demons: fallen angels who express intense disdain of men, mere mortals by whom they were supplanted. Initially the men of the chorus sing short phrases in close harmony, but as their rage grows more intense the music shifts to a busy fugue, punctuated by shouts of derisive laughter.

Gerontius cannot see the demons, and asks if he will soon see his God. In a barely accompanied recitative that recalls the very opening of the work, the Angel warns him that the experience will be almost unbearable, and in veiled terms describes the stigmata of St. Francis. Angels can be heard, offering praises over and over again. The intensity gradually grows, and eventually the full chorus gives voice to a setting of the section that begins with &quot;Praise to the Holiest in the Height&quot;. After a brief orchestral passage, the Soul hears echoes from the friends he left behind on earth, still praying for him. He encounters the Angel of the Agony, whose intercession is set as an impassioned aria for bass. The Soul&#x27;s Angel, knowing the long-awaited moment has come, sings an Alleluia.

The Soul now goes before God and, in a huge orchestral outburst, is judged in an instant. At this point in the score, Elgar instructs &quot;for one moment, must every instrument exert its fullest force.&quot; This was not originally in Elgar&#x27;s design, but was inserted at the insistence of Jaeger, and remains as a testament to the positive musical influence of his critical friendship with Elgar. In an anguished aria, the Soul then pleads to be taken away. A chorus of souls sings the first lines of Psalm 90 (&quot;Lord, thou hast been our refuge&quot;) and, at last, Gerontius joins them in Purgatory. The final section combines the Angel, chorus, and semichorus in a prolonged song of farewell, and the work ends with overlapping Amens.

===Dedication and superscription===
Elgar dedicated his work &quot;A.M.D.G.&quot; (&quot;Ad maiorem Dei gloriam&quot;, &quot;To the greater glory of God&quot;, the motto of the Society of Jesus or &quot;Jesuits&quot;), following the practice of Johann Sebastian Bach, who would dedicate his works &quot;S.D.G.&quot; (&quot;Soli Deo gloria&quot;, &quot;Glory to God alone&quot;). Underneath this he wrote a line from Virgil: &quot;Quae lucis miseris tam dira cupido?&quot; together with Florio&#x27;s English translation of Montaigne&#x27;s adaptation of Virgil&#x27;s line: &quot;Whence so dyre desire of Light on wretches grow?&quot;

At the end of the manuscript score, Elgar wrote this quotation from John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Sesame and Lilies&quot;:
:This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another: my life was as the vapour and is not; but &quot;this&quot; I saw and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory.

Richter signed the autograph copy of the score with the inscription: &quot;Let drop the Chorus, let drop everybody—but let not drop the wings of your original genius.&quot;

==Recordings==

Henry Wood made acoustic recordings of four extracts from &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; as early as 1916, with Clara Butt as the Angel. Edison Bell issued the work in 1924 with Elgar&#x27;s tacit approval (despite his contract with HMV); acoustically recorded and abridged, it was swiftly rendered obsolete by the introduction of the electrical process, and soon after withdrawn. HMV issued live recorded excerpts from two public performances conducted by Elgar in 1927, with the soloists Margaret Balfour, Steuart Wilson, Tudor Davies, Herbert Heyner, and Horace Stevens. Private recordings from radio broadcasts (&quot;off-air&quot; recordings) also exist in fragmentary form from the 1930s.

The first complete recording was made by EMI in 1945, conducted by Malcolm Sargent with his regular chorus and orchestra, the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Liverpool Philharmonic. The soloists were Heddle Nash, Gladys Ripley, Dennis Noble and Norman Walker. This is the only recording to date that employs different singers for the Priest and the Angel of the Agony. The first stereophonic recording was made by EMI in 1964, conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. It has remained in the catalogues continuously since its first release, and is notable for Janet Baker&#x27;s singing as the Angel. Another recording was made by EMI in 1966 featuring Sir Adrian Boult and The New Philharmonia Orchestra with the John Aldis Choir and London Philharmonic Choir. The singers were Nicolai Gedda, Helen Watts and Robert Lloyd. Benjamin Britten&#x27;s 1971 recording for Decca was noted for its fidelity to Elgar&#x27;s score, showing, as the &quot;Gramophone&quot; reviewer said, that &quot;following the composer&#x27;s instructions strengthens the music&#x27;s dramatic impact&quot;. Of the other dozen or so recordings on disc, most are directed by British conductors, with the exception of a 1960 recording in German under Hans Swarowsky and a Russian recording (sung in English by British forces) under Yevgeny Svetlanov performed &#x27;live&#x27; in Moscow in 1983. Another Russian conductor, Vladimir Ashkenazy, performed the work with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and its choral and vocal soloists in 2008 and this too has been released on CD.

The BBC Radio 3 feature &quot;Building a Library&quot; has presented comparative reviews of all available versions of &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; on three occasions. Comparative reviews also appear in &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot;, 2008, and &quot;Gramophone&quot;, February 2003. The recordings recommended by all three are Sargent&#x27;s 1945 EMI version and Barbirolli&#x27;s 1964 EMI recording.

==Arrangements==
Prelude to &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, arranged by John Morrison for symphonic wind band, publisher Molenaar Edition.

Taking his cue from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Prelude and Liebestod&quot;, Elgar himself made an arrangement entitled &quot;Prelude and Angel&#x27;s Farewell&quot; subtitled &quot;for orchestra alone&quot; which was published in 1902 by Novello. In 1917 he recorded a drastically abridged version of this transcription on a single-sided acoustic 78rpm disc.

==In popular culture==
The work features as a key plot point in the 1974 BBC &quot;Play for Today&quot; by David Rudkin, &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot;.

In 2010, the British radio Soap The Archers ended the episode in which Phil dies with music from this work instead of the usual theme tune.

In 2024 it was announced that a new film entitled &quot;The Choral&quot; was to be made, concerning a performance in 1916 of &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; by the fictitious Ramsden Choral Society. The script is by Alan Bennett and the Director is Nicholas Hytner. Among the leading actors are Jim Broadbent, Ralph Fiennes and Simon Russell Beale. Filming was completed in July 2024 and the film is due for release in 2025.

<doc id="1289256" wikidata="Q545034" url="?curid=1289256" title="Flight plan">
<text>Flight plans are documents filed by a pilot or flight dispatcher with the local Air Navigation Service Provider (e.g., the FAA in the United States) prior to departure which indicate the plane&#x27;s planned route or flight path. Flight plan format is specified in ICAO Doc 4444. They generally include basic information such as departure and arrival points, estimated time en route, alternate airports in case of bad weather, type of flight (whether instrument flight rules [IFR] or visual flight rules [VFR]), the pilot&#x27;s information, number of people on board, and information about the aircraft itself. In most countries, flight plans are required for flights under IFR, but may be optional for flying VFR unless crossing international borders. Flight plans are highly recommended, especially when flying over inhospitable areas such as water, as they provide a way of alerting rescuers if the flight is overdue. In the United States and Canada, when an aircraft is crossing the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), either an IFR or a special type of VFR flight plan called a DVFR (Defense VFR) flight plan must be filed. For IFR flights, flight plans are used by air traffic control to initiate tracking and routing services. For VFR flights, their only purpose is to provide needed information should search and rescue operations be required, or for use by air traffic control when flying in a &quot;Special Flight Rules Area.&quot;

==Route or flight paths==
Routing types used in flight planning are: airway, navaid and direct. A route may be composed of segments of different routing types. For example, a route from Chicago to Rome may include airway routing over the U.S. and Europe, but direct routing over the Atlantic Ocean.

===Airway or flight path===
Airway routing occurs along pre-defined pathways called flight paths. Airways can be thought of as three-dimensional highways for aircraft. In most land areas of the world, aircraft are required to fly airways between the departure and destination airports. The rules governing airway routing cover altitude, airspeed, and requirements for entering and leaving the airway (see SIDs and STARs). Most airways are eight nautical miles (14 kilometers) wide, and the airway flight levels keep aircraft separated by at least 1000 vertical feet from aircraft on the flight level above and below. Airways usually intersect at Navaids, which designate the allowed points for changing from one airway to another. Airways have names consisting of one or more letters followed by one or more digits (e.g., V484 or UA419).

The airway structure is divided into high and low altitudes. The low altitude airways in the U.S. which can be navigated using VOR Navaids have names that start with the letter V, and are therefore called Victor Airways. They cover altitudes from approximately 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) to above mean sea level (MSL). T routes are low altitude RNAV only routes which may or may not utilize VOR NAVAIDS. The high altitude airways in the U.S. have names that start with the letter J and are called Jet Routes, or Q for Q routes. Q routes in the U.S. are RNAV only high altitude airways, whereas J routes use VOR NAVAID&#x27;s the same way V routes do. J &amp; Q routes run from to . The altitude separating the low and high airway structures varies from country to country. For example, it is in Switzerland, and in Egypt.

===Navaid===

Navaid routing occurs between Navaids (short for Navigational Aids, see VOR) which are not always connected by airways. Navaid routing is typically only allowed in the continental U.S. If a flight plan specifies Navaid routing between two Navaids which are connected via an airway, the rules for that particular airway must be followed as if the aircraft was flying Airway routing between those two Navaids. Allowable altitudes are covered in Flight Levels.

===Direct===

Direct routing occurs when one or both of the route segment endpoints are at a latitude/longitude which is not located at a Navaid. Some flight planning organizations specify that checkpoints generated for a Direct route be a limited distance apart, or limited by time to fly between the checkpoints (i.e. direct checkpoints could be farther apart for a fast aircraft than for a slow one).

==SIDs and STARs==
SIDs and STARs are procedures and checkpoints used to enter and leave the airway system by aircraft operating on IFR flight plans. There is a defined transition point at which an airway and a SID or STAR intersect.

A SID, or Standard Instrument Departure, defines a pathway out of an airport and onto the airway structure. A SID is sometimes called a Departure Procedure (DP). SIDs are unique to the associated airport.

A STAR, or Standard Terminal Arrival Route, (&#x27;Standard Instrument Arrival&#x27; in the UK) defines a pathway into an airport from the airway structure. STARs can be associated with more than one arrival airport, which can occur when two or more airports are in proximity (e.g., San Francisco and San Jose).

==Special use airspace==
In general, flight planners are expected to avoid areas called Special Use Airspace (SUA) when planning a flight. In the United States, there are several types of SUA, including Restricted, Warning, Prohibited, Alert, and Military Operations Area (MOA). Examples of Special Use Airspace include a region around the White House in Washington, D.C., and the country of Cuba. Government and military aircraft may have different requirements for particular SUA areas, or may be able to acquire special clearances to traverse through these areas.

==Flight levels==
Flight levels (FL) are used by air traffic controllers to simplify the vertical separation of aircraft and one exists every 100 feet relative to an agreed pressure level. Above a transitional altitude, which can vary from country to country and even within a country, the worldwide agreed upon pressure datum of 1013.25 millibars (corresponding to the pressure at sea level for the ICAO Standard Atmosphere, 101.325 kPa) or the equivalent setting of 29.92 inches of mercury is entered into the altimeter and altitude is then referred to as a flight level. The altimeter reading is converted to a flight level by removing the trailing two zeros: for example, 29000 feet becomes FL290. When the pressure at sea level is by chance the international standard then the flight level is also the altitude. To avoid confusion, below the transition altitude, height is referred to as a numeric altitude, for example &#x27;descend 5000 feet&#x27; and above the transition altitude, &#x27;climb flight level 250&#x27;.

Airways have a set of associated standardized flight levels (sometimes called the &quot;flight model&quot;) which must be used when on the airway. On a bi-directional airway, each direction has its own set of flight levels. A valid flight plan must include a legal flight level at which the aircraft will travel the airway. A change in airway may require a change in flight level.

In the US, Canada and Europe for eastbound (heading 0–179 degrees) IFR flights, the flight plan must list an &quot;odd&quot; flight level in 2000 foot increments starting at FL190 (i.e., FL190, FL210, FL230, etc.); Westbound (heading 180–359 degrees) IFR flights must list an &quot;even&quot; flight level in 2000 foot increments starting at FL180 (i.e., FL180, FL200, FL220, etc.). However, Air Traffic Control (ATC) may assign any flight level at any time if traffic situations merit a change in altitude.

Aircraft efficiency increases with height. Burning fuel decreases the weight of an aircraft which may then choose to increase its flight level to further improve fuel consumption. For example, an aircraft may be able to reach FL290 early in a flight, but step climb to FL370 later in the route after weight has decreased due to fuel burn off.

*RVSM

==Alternate airports==
Part of flight planning often involves the identification of one or more airports which can be flown to in case of unexpected conditions (such as weather) at the destination airport. The planning process must be careful to include only alternate airports which can be reached with the anticipated fuel load and total aircraft weight and that have capabilities necessary to handle the type of aircraft being flown.

In Canada, unlike the United States, unless specifically exempted by a company Operating Certificate, IFR flight plans require an alternate airport, regardless of the forecast destination weather. In order to be considered as a legally valid alternate, the airport must be forecast to be at or above certain weather minima at the estimated time of arrival (at the alternate). The minimum weather conditions vary based on the type of approach(es) available at the alternate airport, and may be found in the General section of the Canada Air Pilot (CAP).

==Fuel==
Aircraft manufacturers are responsible for generating flight performance data which flight planners use to estimate fuel needs for a particular flight. The fuel burn rate is based on specific throttle settings for climbing and cruising. The planner uses the projected weather and aircraft weight as inputs to the flight performance data to estimate the necessary fuel to reach the destination. The fuel burn is usually given as the weight of the fuel (usually pounds or kilograms) instead of the volume (such as gallons or litres) because aircraft weight is critical.

In addition to standard fuel needs, some organizations require that a flight plan include reserve fuel if certain conditions are met. For example, an over-water flight of longer than a specific duration may require the flight plan to include reserve fuel. The reserve fuel may be planned as extra which is left over on the aircraft at the destination, or it may be assumed to be burned during flight (perhaps due to unaccounted for differences between the actual aircraft and the flight performance data).

In case of an in-flight emergency it may be necessary to determine whether it is quicker to divert to the alternate airfield or continue to the destination. This can be calculated according to the formula (known as the Vir Narain formula) as follows:
:formula_1
where &quot;C&quot; is the distance from the Critical Point (equitime point) to the destination, &quot;D&quot; the distance between the destination and the alternate airfield, &quot;O&quot; is the groundspeed, &quot;A&quot; is the airspeed, &quot;θ = Φ +/- d&quot; (where &quot;Φ&quot; is the angle between the track to the destination and the track from the destination to the alternate airfield), and &quot;d&quot; is the drift (plus when the drift and the alternate airfield are on the opposite sides of the track, and minus when they are on the same side).

==Flight plan timeline==
Flight plans may be submitted before departure or even after the aircraft is in the air. However flight plans may be submitted up to 120 hours in advance either by voice or by data link; though they are usually filled out or submitted just several hours before departure. The minimum recommended time is one hour before departure for domestic flights, and up to three hours before international flights. This depends on the country the aircraft is flying out of.

==Other flight planning considerations==
Holding over the destination or alternate airports is a required part of some flight plans. Holding (circling in a pattern designated by the airport control tower) may be necessary if unexpected weather or congestion occurs at the airport. If the flight plan calls for hold planning, the additional fuel and hold time should appear on the flight plan.

Organized Tracks are a series of paths similar to airways which cross ocean areas. Some organized track systems are fixed and appear on navigational charts (e.g., the NOPAC tracks over the Northern Pacific Ocean). Others change on a daily basis depending on weather, west or eastbound and other factors and therefore cannot appear on printed charts (e.g., the North Atlantic Tracks (NAT) over the Atlantic Ocean).

==Description of flight plan blocks (FAA) Domestic Flight Plan Form 7233-1,==
# Type: Type of flight plan. Flights may be VFR, IFR, DVFR, or a combination of types, termed composite.
# Aircraft Identification: The registration of the aircraft, usually the flight or tail number.
# Aircraft Type/Special Equipment: The type of aircraft and how it is equipped. For example, a Mitsubishi Mu-2 equipped with an altitude reporting transponder and GPS would use MU2/G. Equipment codes may be found in the FAA Airman&#x27;s Information Manual.
# True airspeed in knots: The planned cruise true airspeed of the aircraft in knots.
# Departure Point: Usually the identifier of the airport from which the aircraft is departing.
# Departure Time: Proposed and actual times of departure. Times are Universal Time Coordinated.
# Cruising Altitude: The planned cruising altitude or flight level.
# Route: Proposed route of flight. The route can be made up of airways, intersections, navaids, or possibly direct.
# Destination: Point of intended landing. Typically the identifier of the destination airport.
# Estimated Time Enroute: Planned elapsed time between departure and arrival at the destination.
# Remarks: Any information the PIC believes is necessary to be provided to ATC. One common remark is &quot;SSNO&quot;, which means the PIC is unable or unwilling to accept a SID or STAR on an IFR flight.
# Fuel on Board: The amount of fuel on board the aircraft, in hours and minutes of flight time.
# Alternate Airports: Airports of intended landing as an alternate of the destination airport. May be required for an IFR flight plan if poor weather is forecast at the planned destination.
# Pilot&#x27;s Information: Contact information of the pilot for search and rescue purposes.
# Number Onboard: Total number of people on board the aircraft.
# Color of Aircraft: The color helps identify the aircraft to search and rescue personnel.
# Contact Information at Destination: Having a means of contacting the pilot is useful for tracking down an aircraft that has failed to close its flight plan and is possibly overdue or in distress.

==Some terms and acronyms used in flight planning==
;Above Ground Level (AGL)
:A measurement of elevation, or &quot;height&quot;, above a specific land mass (also see MSL).
;International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
:The ICAO is the specialized agency of the United Nations with a mandate &quot;to ensure the safe, efficient and orderly evolution of international civil aviation.&quot; The standards which become accepted by the ICAO member nations &quot;cover all technical and operational aspects of international civil aviation, such as safety, personnel licensing, operation of aircraft, aerodromes, air traffic services, accident investigation and the environment.&quot; A simple example of ICAO responsibilities is the unique worldwide names used to identify Navaids, Airways, airports and countries.
;Knot (Kt)
:A unit of speed used in navigation equal to one nautical mile per hour.
;Mean Sea Level (MSL)
:The average height of the surface of the sea for all stages of tide; used as a reference for altitude (also see AGL).
;Nautical mile (NM)
:A unit of distance used in aviation and maritime navigation, equal to approximately one minute of arc of latitude on a great circle. It is defined to be 1852 metres exactly, or approximately 1.15 statute mile.
;Route Forecast (ROFOR)
:A format for reporting weather information.
;Zero-Fuel Weight (ZFW)
:The weight of the aircraft with crew, cargo, and passengers, but without fuel.

<text>Moses de León ( 1240 – 1305), known in Hebrew as Moshe ben Shem-Tov (), was a Spanish rabbi and Kabbalist who first publicized the Zohar. Modern scholars believe the Zohar is his own work, despite his claim to have copied it out of an ancient manuscript by Shimon ben Yochai. His other works include &quot;Sefer ha-Rimon&quot;, written in Hebrew, and hundreds of pseudepigraphic responsa, commentaries, and Kabbalistic tracts which he falsely attributed to earlier authorities.

== Life ==
Moses de León was born in León, Kingdom of León in modern-day Spain, then united with the Crown of Castile. He might have been born in Guadalajara and his surname, then, comes from his father, Shem-Tov de León. He spent 30 years in Guadalajara and Valladolid before moving to Ávila, where he spent the rest of his life. Moses de León died at Arévalo in 1305 while returning to his home.

<text>Culver Field is a former baseball ground located in Rochester, New York. Located at the northwest corner of University Avenue and Culver Road, Culver Field was home of the Rochester Broncos from 1886 until it burned down on October 8, 1893.

Re-built for the 1898 season, the new Culver Field played host to the newly named Rochester Beau Brummels for a decade. However, the right field bleachers collapsed May 19, 1906, leading to dozens of injuries and lawsuits. After the 1907 season, the ballpark was acquired by Gleason Works, which turned the site into the plant that stands to this day.

Late in the 1898 season, three neutral-site games were played in Rochester, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cleveland Spiders of the National League. The games of August 27 and 29 were played at Culver Field. The game of the 28th (a Sunday) was played at the Ontario Beach Grounds in the Charlotte section of the city.
