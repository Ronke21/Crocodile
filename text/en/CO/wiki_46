<text>Allen Klein (December 18, 1931 – July 4, 2009) was an American businessman whose aggressive negotiation tactics affected industry standards for compensating recording artists. He founded ABKCO Music &amp; Records Incorporated. Klein increased profits for his musician clients by negotiating new record company contracts. He first scored monetary and contractual gains for Buddy Knox and Jimmy Bowen, one-hit rockabillies of the late 1950s, then parlayed his early successes into a position managing Sam Cooke, and eventually managed the Beatles and the Rolling Stones simultaneously, along with many other artists, becoming one of the most powerful individuals in the music industry during his era.

Rather than offering financial advice and maximizing his clients&#x27; income as a business manager normally would, Klein set up what he called &quot;buy/sell agreements&quot; where a company that Klein owned became an intermediary between his client and the record label, owning the rights to the music, manufacturing the records, selling them to the record label, and paying royalties and cash advances to the client. Although Klein greatly increased his clients&#x27; incomes, he also enriched himself, sometimes without his clients&#x27; knowledge. The Rolling Stones&#x27; $1.25 million advance from the Decca Records label in 1965, for example, was deposited into a company that Klein had established, and the fine print of the contract did not require Klein to release it for 20 years. Klein&#x27;s involvement with both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones would lead to years of litigation and, specifically for the Rolling Stones, accusations from the group that Klein had withheld royalty payments, stolen the publishing rights to their songs, and neglected to pay their taxes for five years, thus necessitating their French &quot;exile&quot; in 1971.

After years of pursuit by the IRS, Klein was convicted of the misdemeanor charge of making a false statement on his 1972 tax return, for which, in 1980, he was jailed for two months.

==Early life==
Klein was born in Newark, New Jersey, the fourth child and only son of Jewish immigrants. His mother died of cancer soon afterward, and Klein lived for a time with his grandparents, then in a Jewish orphanage, until his father remarried shortly before Klein&#x27;s 10th birthday. An indifferent student, he graduated from Weequahic High School in 1950; fellow graduate Philip Roth was the only classmate to sign his yearbook.

In early work experience with a magazine and newspaper distribution company, Klein showed skill with numbers, and learned about how profits were often concealed from those who had been crucial in generating them. Eventually he realized that much the same situation existed in popular music, where labels routinely took much profit from the transitory careers of the artists who created the profit-generating music, paying them less than Klein thought they should.

Klein enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1951, and served as a clerk typist on Governors Island, New York. After military service, and with the assistance of the G.I. Bill, Klein majored in accounting at Upsala College, graduating in 1957, and was hired by a Manhattan accounting firm, Joseph Fenton and Company. He was assigned to assist Joe Fenton in an audit of a music publishers&#x27; organization, the Harry Fox Agency, and several record companies, including Dot Records, Liberty Records, and Monarch Records. In an early setback to Klein&#x27;s career, Joseph Fenton and Company fired him after four months because of chronic lateness. The company wrote to the State of New Jersey urging officials not to approve him as a Certified Public Accountant, and Klein chose not to take the examination. He briefly attended law school but soon dropped out.

Aided by his friendship with music publisher Don Kirshner, a fellow Upsala College alumnus, Klein worked as an accountant for the next several years, assisted by Henry Newfeld, a CPA who was a friend from school and the Army, and Marty Weinberg, another CPA, under the name Allen Klein and Company. Klein&#x27;s clients included Ersel Hickey, Dimitri Tiomkin, Steve Lawrence, Eydie Gormé, Sam Cooke, Buddy Knox, Jimmy Bowen, Lloyd Price, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Darin, Bobby Vinton, Scepter Records, and the estate of Mike Todd. A key early contact was attorney Marty Machat, who frequently did legal work for Klein.

In June 1958, Klein married Betty Rosenblum, a Hunter College student seven years his junior. The couple had three children.

Klein acquired a reputation as a tough negotiator who could bring money to his clients. Two of them, rockabilly singers Knox and Bowen, were owed royalties by Roulette Records. Morris Levy, co-owner of Roulette, was feared because of his organized crime connections. He was known to pay artists as little as possible. Klein persuaded him to pay Knox and Bowen the royalties they were owed over a four-year period. Klein&#x27;s success with the Knox and Bowen negotiation brought him new clients, and he and Levy became lifelong friends.

==Sam Cooke==
In 1963, Klein began a business partnership with Jocko Henderson, an urbane black disc jockey who had daily radio shows in both Philadelphia and New York City. Henderson hosted lavish, profitable live rhythm-and-blues shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, and formed a partnership with Klein to begin doing the same in Philadelphia. As Henderson&#x27;s partner, Klein was introduced to Sam Cooke, a preeminent talent equally adept at writing, producing, and performing his numerous hit records. Cooke had four top-ten hits between 1957 and 1963, including his number one hit, &quot;You Send Me,&quot; among 33 records in the top 100 in that period. Although Cooke was clearly making his label, RCA Records, a great deal of money, label executives nonetheless repeatedly refused to honor his many requests for a review of his accounts. Klein forced the label to open its books for a thorough audit. Shortly afterward, RCA agreed to renegotiate Cooke&#x27;s contract.

Klein secured Cooke a genuinely groundbreaking deal. Cooke created a holding company, Tracey Ltd., named after Cooke&#x27;s middle daughter. Klein, Cooke&#x27;s manager, sneakily changed paperwork and listed himself as owner instead (and Cooke as his employee). Cooke trusted him to protect him against crooked music executives but Klein used that trust to his advantage.

Tracey manufactured Cooke&#x27;s recordings and gave exclusive rights to RCA to sell them for 30 years, after which the rights would revert to Tracey. Cooke received a cash advance of $100,000 per year for three years, followed by $75,000 for each of two option years. Instead of being paid the first $100,000 in cash, Cooke was paid in Tracey preferred stock, which would be taxed only when he sold it. The deal benefited Cooke, but also greatly benefited Klein, who ended up owning the rights to all of Cooke&#x27;s recordings made since the contract renegotiation when Cooke was killed in 1964 and his widow sold Cooke&#x27;s remaining rights to Klein.

Klein&#x27;s successful negotiations on Cooke&#x27;s behalf brought him new clients, including Bobby Vinton and the Dave Clark Five. As with Cooke, Klein arranged for his clients to be paid over a period of time to reduce their tax liability. This also benefited Klein, who took advantage of the earning potential of money over time to &quot;make money from the money.&quot;

According to the 2019 documentary &quot;Lady You Shot Me: The Life and Death of Sam Cooke&quot;, Klein had a predatory relationship with Cooke. As of 2019, Cooke&#x27;s family received no royalties or benefits from his music. All royalties and publishing profits go to Klein&#x27;s corporation.

==Mickie Most and the British Invasion==
In 1964, Klein became the American business manager of Mickie Most, a former singer who was the producer of hits for the Animals and Herman&#x27;s Hermits. Klein extended to Most a million-dollar promise, adding that if he failed to deliver in only one month, Most owed him nothing. Klein did deliver, through strategic renegotiations of existing contracts and new producing opportunities for RCA, including offers for Most to produce for both Cooke and Elvis Presley. Though the latter two prospects did not materialize, Most was suddenly one of the most talked-about and financially gratified figures in the English recording industry, and Klein was a step closer to eventual agreements with both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

His victories for Most won Klein access to several key English musicians. He eventually negotiated vastly improved deals for The Animals, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, the Kinks, Lulu, Donovan, and Pete Townshend of the Who. But Klein&#x27;s help came at a price. To shelter his clients&#x27; money from Britain&#x27;s high taxation rate on income earned abroad, Klein held it for them at the Chemical Bank in New York City and paid it to them over periods of time of up to 20 years. Klein invested that money, which earned far more than Klein was obligated to pay his clients, and kept the difference, thereby maintaining control over the money.

==The Rolling Stones==

In the spring of 1965 Andrew Loog Oldham, co-manager of the Rolling Stones, saw in Klein a terrific business adviser and ally, one who could help him win an incipient power struggle with Eric Easton, a music business veteran who was then the other half of the band&#x27;s management team. Barely 21, Oldham was profoundly important in the development of the Stones&#x27; image, and in initiating the songwriting partnership of Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. After some management mishaps, blame for which fell at Easton&#x27;s feet, and Jagger&#x27;s ascension in the band&#x27;s hierarchy following &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, the Stones&#x27; first number one record in the U.S., Oldham received Jagger&#x27;s blessing to bring Klein aboard to renegotiate the band&#x27;s contract with Decca Records. The label offered the band the opportunity to make $300,000 if their records continued to sell. Klein countered with, and quickly secured, an arrangement paying the Stones twice as much, in the form of an advance. He also forced London Records, Decca&#x27;s American subsidiary, to sign a separate contract. It too was for $600,000. By the time Klein renegotiated the deal a year later, Easton having been removed as co-manager, the Stones were guaranteed $2.6 million—more than the Beatles were making.

When Klein examined the Stones&#x27; management contract with Easton and Oldham, he found that the two were receiving a disproportionate share of the group&#x27;s income: not only did Easton and Oldham receive an 8% royalty on sales of the Stones&#x27; singles—the Stones themselves received only 6%—but they also received a 25% commission on the Stones&#x27; income. At Klein&#x27;s insistence, Oldham increased the Stones&#x27; royalties to 7% and relinquished his commission. Klein offered the Stones a million-dollar minimum guarantee, paid over a 20-year period to reduce the Stones&#x27; tax liability, to let him become their music publisher, based on his faith in the Jagger–Richards songwriting team. He also arranged for a level of tour support and publicity far above anything the band had previously experienced for the Stones&#x27; 1965 American tour in support of the album &quot;December&#x27;s Children&quot;.

Jagger, who had studied at the London School of Economics, gradually became distrustful of Klein, particularly because of Klein&#x27;s ability to insert himself as a profit participant in the group&#x27;s ever-growing financial affairs. For example, in 1968 Klein very profitably bought out Oldham&#x27;s share in the band for $750,000. By 1968 the Stones were so concerned with how Klein was handling their finances that they hired a London law firm, Berger Oliver &amp; Co, to look into it, and Jagger hired the merchant banker Prince Rupert Loewenstein as his personal financial adviser. Another possible factor in the Stones&#x27; dissatisfaction with Klein was that when he began to manage the Beatles he focused more of his attention on that band&#x27;s affairs than on the concerns of the Stones. In 1970, on the occasion of needing to negotiate a new contract with Decca, Jagger announced that Loewenstein would replace Klein as manager.

The split between Klein and the Stones led to years of litigation. In 1971 the Stones sued Klein over U.S. publishing rights. The suit was settled the following year, with the Stones receiving $1.2 million as a settlement of all U.S. royalties earned up to that point (essentially the $1.25 million advance that Decca had paid the Stones in 1965 that Klein had been withholding since August 1965). But the Stones were unable to break their contract with Klein, who held an additional $2 million of their money to be paid over a 15-year period, ostensibly for tax purposes. Klein&#x27;s company, ABKCO, continued to control the rights to publish the Stones&#x27; music and Klein made a fortune off the band&#x27;s all-time best-selling album, &quot;Hot Rocks 1964–1971&quot;. 

In 1972, Klein alleged that some of the songs on &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; had been composed while the Stones were still under contract with ABKCO. As a result, ABKCO acquired ownership of the disputed songs and was able to publish another Rolling Stones album, &quot;More Hot Rocks (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies)&quot;. In 1974 negotiations over royalties led to a payment of $375,000 to the Stones and ABKCO&#x27;s release of an additional Rolling Stones album, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. In 1975 more lawsuits and negotiations resulted in a $1 million payment to the Stones for non-payment by Klein of songwriting royalties, and the release of four Rolling Stones albums, including &quot;Rock and Roll Circus&quot; and &quot;Rolled Gold: The Very Best of the Rolling Stones&quot;. In 1984 Jagger and Richards sued to break their publishing agreement with ABKCO because of non-payment of royalties. The judge encouraged the two sides to reach a settlement.

Starting in 1986, when the introduction of compact discs brought great profits to the music industry, relations began to improve between Klein and the Stones. In 2002, the Stones&#x27; album &quot;Forty Licks&quot; and the Licks Tour, celebrating the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary, incorporated songs owned by ABKCO. The Stones agreed to a five-year payment plan suggested by Klein&#x27;s son, Jody. In 2003, Klein negotiated with Steve Jobs to make ABKCO&#x27;s Rolling Stones songs available on iTunes.

==Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO==
In February 1967, with an eye toward producing films and finding a way to invest his clients&#x27; money, Klein attempted to acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. His hopes were blunted when Edgar Bronfman, Sr., heir to the Seagram fortune, instead took control of the firm. Klein then turned his attention to Cameo-Parkway Records, a Philadelphia-born, Los Angeles-based label that had enjoyed hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, thanks to Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell, Dee Dee Sharp, and others, but that by 1967 was no longer prospering. It was one of the first publicly traded record companies, making it ideal for a financial maneuver Klein had in mind, known as a reverse acquisition. It was meant to take Allen Klein and Company public via its being acquired on paper by Cameo-Parkway. By July 1967, Klein and his associate Abbey Butler had acquired a controlling interest and filed to rename Cameo-Parkway ABKCO, an acronym for &quot;The Allen and Betty Klein Company.&quot; Fueled by speculation, the stock price increased from $1.75 a share in July 1967 to a peak of in February 1968 before the SEC halted trading. The American Stock Exchange declined to reinstate the stock; instead, ABKCO continued to trade over the counter, and the stock price dropped to more realistic levels. In 1987, Klein made ABKCO a privately held company.

==The Beatles==

In 1964 Klein approached the Beatles&#x27; manager, Brian Epstein, with an offer for the Beatles to sign with RCA for $2 million. Epstein was not interested, saying he was loyal to EMI. After Epstein died in August 1967, the group formed Apple Corps in January 1968. They hoped it would provide the means for correcting Epstein&#x27;s unfortunate business decisions, which had both limited their incomes and ensured high tax burdens. Although &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; first Apple release, was an enormous success, the label was a financial mess, with little accountability for how money was spent.

Klein contacted John Lennon after reading his press comment that the Beatles would be &quot;broke in six months&quot; if things continued as they were. On January 26, 1969, he met with Lennon, who retained Klein as his financial representative, and the next day met with the other Beatles. Paul McCartney preferred to be represented by Lee and John Eastman, the father and brother respectively of McCartney&#x27;s girlfriend Linda, whom he married on March 12. Given a choice between Klein and the Eastmans, George Harrison and Ringo Starr preferred Klein. Following rancorous London meetings with both Eastmans in April, Klein was appointed as the Beatles&#x27; manager on an interim basis, with the Eastmans appointed as their attorneys. Continued conflict between Klein and the Eastmans made this arrangement unworkable. The Eastmans were dismissed as the Beatles&#x27; attorneys, and on May 8 Klein was given a three-year contract as the Beatles&#x27; business manager. McCartney refused to sign the contract but was outvoted by the other Beatles.

Once in charge of Apple, Klein fired many of its employees, including president Ron Kass, and replaced them with his own people. He closed Apple Electronics, which was headed by Alexis Mardas. Mardas resigned his directorship in May 1971. Klein&#x27;s attempt to fire Neil Aspinall, a longtime confidant of the Beatles, was immediately thwarted by the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrone/Independent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein was hit with his first crisis in managing the Beatles when Clive Epstein, brother of Brian and chief heir to NEMS, the management company Brian had founded, sold NEMS to Triumph, a British investment group managed by Leonard Richenberg. NEMS held a 25% stake in the Beatles&#x27; earnings, which Klein and the Beatles desperately wanted to buy out. This led to tough negotiations with Triumph. Klein ultimately secured the Beatles&#x27; rights in their previous work for just four annual payments amounting to 5% of their earnings. But in the lead-up to those negotiations Richenberg commissioned a hostile investigative report on Klein, which &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ran under the headline &quot;The Toughest Wheeler-Dealer in the Pop Jungle&quot;.

An even more important battle to secure the Beatles a financial situation commensurate with their acclaim was with Northern Songs Ltd., the publishing company. Northern Songs was managed by Dick James, whom Brian Epstein had rewarded with the Beatles&#x27; publishing rights in return for helping them get placed on a TV show, &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, early in their career. But James had constructed a contract that gave him an outsize share and Epstein had not understood its implications. James knew that Klein would soon eliminate his perks, so he quickly offered to sell Northern Songs to ATV, run by entertainment mogul Lew Grade, rather than allow Lennon and McCartney an opportunity to buy back publishing rights to their songs. Klein worked feverishly to pull together a consortium that would beat Grade&#x27;s offer, but infighting between McCartney and Lennon derailed his efforts.

In September 1969, while Klein was renegotiating the Beatles&#x27; unsatisfactory recording agreements with EMI, Lennon told him of his plans to quit the group. It was agreed that this was the wrong time to either make or announce such a move. EMI was loath to renegotiate, but its American subsidiary, Capitol Records, was so impressed by &quot;Abbey Road&quot; that it agreed to vastly improved royalty terms. McCartney joined his bandmates in endorsing the deal Klein had secured.

&quot;Abbey Road&quot; proved to be the Beatles&#x27; last true collaboration, but Klein recognised an opportunity in the band&#x27;s shelved January 1969 album and related documentary project, both titled &quot;Get Back&quot;, to get another album release out of the splintered band while also fulfilling its obligation to provide one more film to United Artists, the studio that had released &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;. Phil Spector, the producer famous for his &quot;wall of sound&quot; recordings with artists such as the Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers, was eager to sign on as producer for the album, which was eventually titled &quot;Let It Be&quot;. McCartney did not approve of Spector, but the other Beatles did. This proved to be McCartney and Klein&#x27;s last face-to-face meeting. Apple made $6 million in the month following the May 1970 release of the record and the film.

Unhappy with production decisions on the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album and the other Beatles&#x27; decision to hire Klein as their manager, McCartney went public with his plans to leave the Beatles in April 1970. He wanted to be released from his partnership with Lennon, Starr, and Harrison, who had in recent months been a steady three-to-one majority against McCartney&#x27;s proposals. The Eastmans convinced McCartney to sue his former bandmates for dissolution of the Beatles&#x27; partnership, which he did on December 31, 1970.

The judge ruled in McCartney&#x27;s favor in March 1971. He decided that the combined financial affairs of the former Beatles should be placed in the care of a receiver until mutually acceptable terms for their breakup could be found. Klein thereby retained a position in the post-breakup solo careers of Harrison, Starr, and Lennon, but was no longer in charge of their affairs as a partnership.

==Solo Beatles==
For the first few years after the Beatles&#x27; contentious break-up, George Harrison was widely seen as the most accomplished and artistically successful former Beatle. His November 1970 three-disc set, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, was a sales triumph, and produced hit singles in &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot;. In the spring of 1971, Harrison learned from his friend and mentor, Ravi Shankar, about the desperate people of Bangladesh, who had been devastated both by military violence and a vicious cyclone. Harrison immediately set about organizing an event at Madison Square Garden within just five weeks—the Concert for Bangladesh—from which a live album could raise further funds for Bangladeshi refugees. Klein hustled to get the invited artists, including Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton, to play for free while donating their shares of royalties to charity, and convinced Capitol Records to grant an unprecedented 50% royalty rate. The &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; live album and film raised over $15 million. But Klein failed to register the shows as a UNICEF charity event; as a result, the proceeds were denied tax-exempt status in Britain and the U.S. The IRS attempted to tax the income, and $10 million of that amount was held back for years.

Harrison and Lennon soon became disenchanted with Klein. By mid-1972, Harrison was incensed at the outcome of Klein&#x27;s handling of the Bangladesh relief effort. Aside from the question of its charity status, unwelcome attention had been drawn to the project after an article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine accused Klein of pocketing $1.14 on each copy of the live album (priced at $10)—allegations that raised suspicions among the three former Beatles with regard to his conduct in their business affairs. Lennon also felt betrayed by Klein&#x27;s lack of support for his and Yoko Ono&#x27;s increasingly politically focused work, typified by their 1972 album &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;. In early 1973 Lennon, Harrison, and Starr served notice that they would not renew Klein&#x27;s management contract when it expired in March. Early the next month, Lennon told an interviewer: &quot;Let&#x27;s say possibly Paul&#x27;s suspicions were right … and the timing was right.&quot;

Klein responded by suing the Beatles and Apple in New York to recoup the loans he had made to his three former clients and other costs owing to ABKCO. They then sued him in the London courts, citing excessive commission fees, the mishandling of the Concert for Bangladesh, his misrepresentation of their individual financial standings, and his failure to ensure that Apple Records&#x27; artists prospered under his control. While the suits were ongoing, Klein made a play for the U.S. portion of Harrison&#x27;s publishing company, Harrisongs, in late 1974, without success. He also attempted to influence the outcome of Lennon&#x27;s arrangement with music publisher Morris Levy regarding an alleged copyright infringement (of the Chuck Berry song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Catch Me&quot;) in Lennon&#x27;s 1969 Beatles composition &quot;Come Together&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Steel and Glass&quot; from the 1974 album &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was his thinly veiled dig at Klein.

Klein&#x27;s 1973 lawsuit against the Beatles was settled out of court in January 1977, with Ono representing the former bandmates. Klein received a lump sum payment of approximately $5 million in lieu of future royalties and as repayment of the loans that ABKCO had made to the Beatles.

Harrison had been sued for copyright infringement in 1971 because of the alleged similarity of his song &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; to &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, which had been recorded by the Chiffons in 1963 and was owned by Bright Tunes Music. The case was still pending in 1976; as an alternate strategy to access Harrison&#x27;s US publishing, Klein purchased Bright Tunes and thus became the plaintiff in the lawsuit against Harrison. The judge ruled that Harrison had infringed on Bright Tunes&#x27; copyright, and the ruling was upheld on appeal. The judge initially assessed damages of $2,133,316, which Harrison would have to pay to Klein, then reduced the figure to $1,599,987, but finally ruled in 1981 that Klein still had a fiduciary responsibility to Harrison and should not be allowed to profit from his acquisition of Bright Tunes. Klein was ordered to hold &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; in trust for Harrison provided that Harrison reimburse him the $587,000 it had cost Klein to purchase the company.

==Films and theater==
The multi-Academy Award-winning 1955 film &quot;Marty&quot;, an independently produced movie that undercut the Hollywood studio system, provided a business template Klein closely studied and later adapted to the recording industry. In the late 1950s Klein shared an office with press agent Bernie Kamber, who represented Burt Lancaster, one of &quot;Marty&quot; producers. Klein absorbed much from Kamber about how the producers had structured their business model, a paradigm whose strength derived from the fact that artists, not film studios or record labels, drove marketplace success and that intense preparation and canny negotiation could lavishly reward artists and their representatives. In 1961 Klein did accountancy work for an independent film, &quot;Force of Impulse&quot;, and formed lasting relationships that he turned to for many film projects of his own. In 1962 he produced a film, &quot;Without Each Other&quot;. He took it to the Cannes Film Festival and later claimed that it had won the &quot;Best American Picture Award&quot; there, though no such award existed. A distributor never materialized, but Klein&#x27;s enthusiasm for film persisted.

Starting in 1967 Klein produced four films in the Spaghetti Western genre, a lean-and-mean style of cowboy movie with taciturn heroes and explosive violence. Klein used actor Tony Anthony, whom he&#x27;d met on &quot;Force of Impulse&quot;, in all four. Their films included a trilogy comprising &quot;A Stranger In Town&quot;, &quot;The Stranger Returns&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Silent Stranger&quot; (shot in 1968 but not released until 1975 by United Artists). &quot;Blindman&quot; (1970) featured Ringo Starr as a Mexican bandit, Anthony as its lead, and Klein as an extra. The first two &quot;Stranger&quot; films were released by MGM, the studio where Klein produced &quot;Mrs. Brown, You&#x27;ve Got a Lovely Daughter&quot; starring the popular Herman&#x27;s Hermits. Klein, who had tried to purchase MGM in the mid &#x27;60s, became involved with a lawsuit against MGM, with each accusing the other of not fulfilling their contracts with each other.

In 1971, John Lennon directed Klein&#x27;s attention to &quot;El Topo&quot;, a surrealist western by Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky. Inspired by Lennon&#x27;s enthusiasm, Klein bought the film and put it in American release. He then produced and financed Jodorowsky&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, an allegorical journey with psychedelic overtones. Later the producer and the director&#x27;s planned collaboration on a proposed film version of &quot;Story of O&quot; was halted when Jodorowsky refused to make the film or return substantial advance monies. Klein retaliated by withdrawing both &quot;El Topo&quot; and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; from distribution. In 2008 Jodorowsky released the films in Europe and was sued by Klein. After a face-to-face reconciliation between the two, Klein dropped his lawsuit and ABKCO released the films on video, paying Jodorowsky to remaster them.

Klein&#x27;s legs appeared in Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Up Your Legs Forever&quot;. With George Harrison, Klein co-produced the 1972 concert film &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;. Klein also produced the 1978 film &quot;The Greek Tycoon&quot;, in which Anthony Quinn and Jacqueline Bisset played characters based on Aristotle Onassis and Jacqueline Kennedy. In the early 1980s Klein produced two Broadway plays. &quot;It Had to be You&quot;, a romantic comedy starring Renée Taylor and Joseph Bologna, ran for barely a month. Next Klein produced &quot;The Man Who Had Three Arms&quot;, written by Edward Albee. Although Albee had had big successes with &quot;The Zoo Story&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, the play Klein produced had an even shorter run than his previous attempt.

==Criminal conviction and jail time==
In 1977, Klein and ABKCO&#x27;s former head of promotion, Pete Bennett, were each charged with three felony counts of income tax evasion for 1970, 1971, and 1972, and related misdemeanor counts of making false statements on their income tax returns for those years. The IRS, which had been investigating Klein for several years, claimed that Klein and Bennett had sold promotional copies of Beatles and post-Beatles albums—common practice in the music industry at the time—without declaring the sales on their tax returns. Klein was alleged to have received over $200,000. Bennett pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor charge and became a witness against Klein. Klein testified that he had not instructed Bennett to sell promotional copies of albums and that although he&#x27;d received cash payments from Bennett, they were a return of cash advances Bennett had been given. Klein&#x27;s first trial ended in a mistrial because the jury was deadlocked. At his second trial in 1979, the jury found Klein not guilty of the felony charges but guilty of a single misdemeanor charge for false statements on his 1972 tax return. Klein was fined $5,000 and sentenced to two months in jail, which he served in July–September 1980.

==Phil Spector==

In 1988 Klein began managing Phil Spector&#x27;s business affairs, including his publishing and recording assets. Spector had not been active as a producer for several years, but his early work was still frequently broadcast and licensed for film soundtracks. Spector&#x27;s publishing company, Mother Bertha Music, Inc, was controlled by Trio, a Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller company, which was in turn administered by Warner/Chappell Music. Warner/Chappell was making appropriate payments, but significant amounts were not being passed on to Spector. Klein&#x27;s goal was to get Spector all the money owed him, and also to wrest a concession allowing Spector to co-administer the future licensing of his music. Klein and Spector sued in federal court, where a win would secure the first goal but not the second. Klein accordingly then advised a settlement strategy that proved successful.

==The Verve==

On their 1997 single &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, the English band the Verve sampled a 1965 orchestral version of the Rolling Stones song &quot;The Last Time&quot; by the Andrew Oldham Orchestra. Klein, who owned the copyrights to the Rolling Stones&#x27; early work, refused clearance for the sample; after a lawsuit, the Verve ceded the songwriting credits and royalties. The song became a hit, popular for use at sporting events, and it was a big money-maker for ABKCO, which licensed its use for commercials advertising Nike shoes and Opel automobiles. In 2019, Klein&#x27;s son and the Rolling Stones returned the credits and royalties to Richard Ashcroft of the Verve.

==Death==
Klein was diagnosed with diabetes at age 40. He suffered several heart attacks over the years, of varying severity. In 2004, the same year that ABKCO collected a Grammy Award for a Sam Cooke documentary, &quot;Legend&quot;, Klein fell and broke bones in his foot, requiring surgery. He was subsequently diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on July 4, 2009, in New York City. The cause of his death was respiratory failure. Yoko Ono and Sean Ono Lennon attended his funeral. Andrew Loog Oldham commented at a subsequent memorial service that Klein had greatly magnified the success of the Rolling Stones.

In June 2015, American journalist Fred Goodman published a biography of Klein, &quot;Allen Klein: The Man Who Bailed Out the Beatles, Made the Stones, and Transformed Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

==Legacy==

In the 1978 television mockumentary &quot;The Rutles: All You Need is Cash&quot;, which parodies the career of the Beatles, Klein is portrayed as &quot;Ron Decline&quot;, played by John Belushi. Introduced as &quot;the most feared promoter in the world&quot;, Decline is so intimidating to his colleagues that they choose to throw themselves out of skyscraper windows rather than face him.

In his book &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money: The Battle for the Soul of the Beatles&quot;, Peter Doggett writes that Klein has come to be seen as one of the controversial &quot;intruders&quot; in the Beatles&#x27; story. Doggett writes:

Suspected for their motives, hated for their disruptive power, they all arrived from America and were all regarded as suspects for the crime of breaking up the Beatles, on the assumption that without them the group would have continued happily in each other&#x27;s company until their dying days. The first of these intruders was Yoko Ono; the second was Linda Eastman; and the third was Allen Klein.

With the possible exception of Alexis Mardas, who occupied a far less central role, nobody in the Beatles&#x27; milieu has received a more damning verdict from historians than Allen Klein. He was, one said, &quot;a tough little scorpion&quot;; for another, &quot;fast-talking, dirty-mouthed … sloppily dressed and grossly overweight&quot;; again, &quot;short and fat, beady-eyed and greasily pompadoured&quot;. Beatles aide Alistair Taylor said, &quot;He had all the charm of a broken lavatory seat&quot; ... So consistent was the vilification that when biographer Philip Norman merely described Klein as &quot;a tubby little man&quot;, it sounded like a compliment.

… No such rehabilitation [as was later afforded Ono and Eastman] was available for Allen Klein, who entered the Beatles&#x27; story as a villain from central casting, and never escaped that role. Yet we are asked to believe that three of the four Beatles found this &quot;beady-eyed&quot; &quot;grossly overweight&quot; &quot;scorpion&quot; such an attractive figure that they were prepared to trust him with their futures. Clearly the Demon King didn&#x27;t always exude the stench of sulphur.

<text>The Golden Centennaires were a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) aerobatic flying team that performed in 1967 to celebrate the Canadian Centennial.
The eight-plane formation team, commanded by Wing Commander O. B. Philp C.M., DFC, CD, featured six-plane formations alternating with two solo aircraft. The aircraft flown was the CT-114 Tutor, which sported a blue and gold paint scheme. The Team Leader was Squadron Leader Clarence B. Lang.

The Golden Centennaires performed 103 shows in Canada, including the opening and closing ceremonies of Expo 67 in Montreal, seven shows in the United States, and two shows in the Bahamas. The team was disbanded after the last show of the season, but the aircraft were used a few years later to form the Snowbirds, Canada&#x27;s current national team.

Accompanying the Golden Centennaires were an Avro 504, a CF-104 Starfighter and a CF-101 Voodoo. All of these aircraft performed at the Centennial airshows.

<text>A pub session (seisiún in Irish; seisean in Scottish Gaelic; seshoon in Manx Gaelic) is performing music in the setting of a local pub, in which the music-making is intermingled with the consumption of ale, stout, and beer and conversation. Performers sing and play traditional songs and tunes from the Irish, English, Scottish, Cornish, and Manx traditions, using instruments such as the fiddle, accordion, concertina, flute, tin whistle, uilleann pipes, tenor banjo, guitar, and bodhrán. Some sessions have dancing too.

== History ==

Singing and consuming alcohol have been practised together from ancient times, but the written evidence is fragmentary until the 16th century. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot;, Hal and Falstaff discuss drinking and playing the &quot;tongs and the bones&quot;. There are depictions of pub singing in paintings by Teniers (1610–1690), Brouwer (1605/6-1638) and Jan Steen (1625/5-1656).

=== 1800 to 1950 ===

The 1830 Beer Act abolished the levy on beer - within a single year 400 new pubs opened, and within 8 years there were 46,000. This number peaked in the 1870s and declined after 1900. By the 1850s, an increasing number of student songs and commercial song-books were published across Europe. The most famous was the &quot;Scottish Students&#x27; Song Book&quot; by John Stuart Blackie (1809–1895). The mixture of traditional songs with hints of erotic humour continues to this day. The Irish tradition also benefited from the compilation of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Music of Ireland&quot;, a compilation of 1,850 pieces of Irish session and dance music, published initially by Francis O&#x27;Neill (1848–1936) in 1903.

One of the most popular drinking songs, &quot;Little Brown Jug,&quot; dates from the 1860s. By 1908 Percy Grainger had begun to record folk singers, but not in their natural habitat—the pub. In 1938 A.L. Lloyd persuaded his employers at the BBC to record the singers in the Eel&#x27;s Foot pub in Eastbridge, Suffolk.

At The Eel&#x27;s Foot, 1939–47, the songs performed included: &quot;False Hearted Knight&quot;, &quot;The Dark-Eyed Sailor&quot;, &quot;The Princess Royal&quot;, &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot;, &quot;Underneath Her Apron&quot;, &quot;Pleasant and Delightful&quot;, &quot;The Blackbird.&quot; Surprisingly, one of the songs was &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Heaven&quot; an American IWW song (Industrial Workers of the World), dating from about 1920. The oldest singer there was William &quot;Velvet&quot; Brightwell (1865–1960). In 1947 the BBC made more recordings there and broadcast them as &quot;Anglia Sings&quot; on 19 November 1947. Almost all of the participants were in their 50s and 60s. Six years later the first folk club opened in Newcastle upon Tyne, and the average age was in the 20s.

== Instruments ==
The fiddle has predominated since the 17th century. The melodeon became popular in the 1890s. By the 1950s the accordion took over, particularly in Scotland. By the 1960s the guitar was the instrument most frequently heard in a pub. Nowadays so many people can afford instruments that ensemble playing is the norm. Celtic tunes are popular, even in England, however English music is enjoying a large revival currently, due in part to &#x27;new-folk&#x27; artists playing traditional English music, such as Bellowhead and Eliza Carthy. Some people go to folk festivals simply in order to play along with others in the beer tent.

=== Choosing an instrument ===

Each session has its own informal rules as to which instruments are acceptable and in what number. Some sessions may have a strict &quot;&#x27;traditional&#x27; instruments only&quot; rule whereas others will accept anyone who shows up to play with any instrument. The word &quot;traditional&quot; is used loosely as sessions themselves are a relatively recently revived phenomenon and some instruments considered &#x27;traditional,&#x27; such as the bouzouki are in fact relatively new to the genres played at a session. It is wise to ask about what is expected at a particular session before bringing a non-&#x27;traditional&#x27; instrument.

Generally there can be an unlimited number of fiddles, flutes, accordions and tin whistles. The bodhrán is common in Irish sessions, but many sessions prefer that only one person play the bodhrán at a time. Uilleann pipes are common in Irish sessions, but the more commonly known Great Highland Bagpipes are never used in a session, because they drown out other instruments. Mandolins, banjos, citterns and bouzoukis are welcome in moderation. Guitars and dulcimers are frequently allowed in sessions without strict &quot;&#x27;traditional&#x27; instruments only&quot; rules.

== Etiquette ==
There are &quot;open sessions&quot;, when anyone who wishes can play, and &quot;closed sessions&quot;, where the playing is restricted to a group. The general rules are fairly simple, but depend on the kind of session. In general, pub sessions are not places for learning an instrument. It is expected that those taking part have attained competence in playing their instrument. Some sessions are wholly instrumental while others will engage the crowd with singing. It is customary to introduce oneself to the other participants before joining in. There will usually be a leader or oldest member who sets the tone and keeps the session running smoothly; often leader(s) do not appear to be leaders at all. Occasionally, even the leaders of a session may not realize that they lead.

Practically, however, there are always leaders at a session, by the nature of human dynamics. Some sessions follow a round-robin structure, others have a more free-for-all approach, and the leader(s) of a session should be observed to see how this particular session is run. Due to freeform nature of the session, there is always an element of serendipity and there is an atmosphere of anticipation and an expectation of tolerance from all present.

It is frowned upon when one openly criticises people who know only one song or only a few tunes. Sessions are occasions to be enjoyed by all participants, and if others are accepted members of the group, it is not up to one person (other than the leaders of the session) to decide that they are not welcome.

== Legal considerations ==
In England and Wales the Licensing Act 2003 came into force in 2005. It could be interpreted as meaning that any performer would be obliged to give prior notification to police, fire brigade and environmental health. Following much lobbying by various groups, the law settled down to allow &quot;spontaneous&quot; events and religious events.

<text>Laburnum refers to a small area in the &#x27;Bellbird&#x27; area of the suburb of Blackburn, Victoria, Australia. It covers the area bordered by Middleborough and Blackburn Roads, Gardiners Creek and the Belgrave/Lilydale railway line. It is a heavily treed area noted for its Laburnum bushes. It is in the local government area of the City of Whitehorse in Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs.

The area is covered by strict planning controls. This has limited development and meant it has been able to retain a village feel, despite only being a short train ride from downtown Melbourne. It has a railway station, primary school, and post office, despite never being a suburb (technically, it is a &quot;neighbourhood&quot;).

The Blackburn Creeklands park is an important community asset of Laburnum providing for both recreation and a wildlife corridor. In 1983, the then Nunawading Council the purchased the middle section of land that integrates and links Blacks Walk, Kalang and Furness Parks into today&#x27;s long, linear park following Gardiners Creek from Middleborough to Blackburn Roads.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Baker DSO (19 June 1908 – 1 June 1958) was a New Zealand soldier who served in the Second World War, leading the 28th (Māori) Battalion from 13 July to 2 November 1942. He was injured at the commencement of the Second Battle of El Alamein and his wounds were such that he was repatriated back to New Zealand. He later worked in New Zealand&#x27;s public service, leading the Rehabilitation Department which assisted servicemen returning from the war into civilian life, by providing them with finance, training and housing.

==Early life==
Frederick Baker was born in the Hokianga, in the north of the North Island of New Zealand, on 19 June 1908 to a bushman and his wife. Of Ngāpuhi descent (via his mother), he attended local schools in the area. Entering the public service after completion of his education, he worked for the Public Works Department based in Whangārei before moving to Hamilton in 1928. He became an accountant, qualifying in late 1931. He transferred to Wellington in 1933, working for the Audit Office and in the same year, married Edna Mavis Carrie. The couple would go on to have two children. By 1935, he was working for the Mortgage Corporation of New Zealand.

==Military career==
Baker had joined the Territorial Forces in his late teens and served with the Northland and Waikato Mounted Rifles as a lieutenant. When he moved to Wellington for work in 1933, he became a reserve officer due to the absence of mounted rifle units in Wellington. Having maintained an interest in the military and concerned by the increasing likelihood of war, in May 1939 he requested to be placed on the active list.

===Second World War===
It was not until November 1939 that a role was found for Baker, as intelligence officer of the 28th (Māori) Battalion, then in the process of formation. However, Baker himself never particularly identified as being Māori. In May, the battalion embarked for the Middle East to join the first echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Division in May 1940 but were diverted for defensive duties in England. By early 1941, the threat of invasion by the Germans had eased and the battalion was finally shipped to Egypt to join up with the rest of the division. Baker in the meantime, had been promoted to captain and placed in command of the battalion&#x27;s headquarters company.

====Greece and Crete====

As the battalion trained at its base in Helwan in preparation for the battalion&#x27;s impending move to Greece, reinforcements from New Zealand arrived to fill the ranks, depleted by illness. Baker was placed in command of the excess troops, which had been formed into a reinforcement company. When the battalion arrived in Greece on 27 March 1941, Baker&#x27;s company was responsible for the battalion&#x27;s advance base outside of Athens. Attached to the 5th Infantry Brigade, the battalion made a good account of itself defending its assigned portion of the Olympus Pass against elements of the 9th Panzer Division but were forced to withdraw from its positions on 17 April. Baker, having been tasked by Brigadier Edward Puttick, the commander of the 4th Infantry Brigade, with the collection of stragglers, was captured by German paratroopers. He managed to escape and, falling in with a truckload of Greeks, returned to Puttick&#x27;s headquarters. He was once more ordered to collect stragglers (this time with infantry support) and direct them to the Porto Rafti beaches in preparation for embarkation for Crete.

On Crete, Baker was assigned to the battalion&#x27;s D Company. He participated in the various defensive actions around Maleme airfield when the Germans launched their attack. Withdrawing from Maleme, Baker led a mixed force of men including infantry from 20th Battalion in an attack to recapture a bridge held by the Germans, but was repulsed. He was later appointed commander of A Company, and was wounded in defending a German counterattack. He led a party of walking wounded to an embarkation point from where they were evacuated to Egypt on 31 May.

====Egypt====
After recuperating from his wounds, Baker was appointed to command of a company in 25th Battalion, then engaged in the North African Campaign along with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division. However, in May 1942, he rejoined the 28th Battalion as its second in command, having been promoted to major. The following month, the battalion was engaged in fighting with the Afrika Corps as it attacked into Egypt. The battalion&#x27;s commanding officer was killed during an artillery barrage on 12 July, elevating Baker to command.

Promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel, Baker withdrew the battalion behind the lines for a brief period of recuperation. Returning to the front lines on 18 July, the battalion manned defensive positions in anticipation of a German attack. In August, it was tasked with carrying out a raid for prisoners and Baker took personal responsibility for reconnoitering the route and objective for the raid, which proved to be a success. It was the first offensive operation conducted by a unit of the Eighth Army since the then Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery assumed command, and he sent a message of congratulations on the successful execution of the raid.

An attack on the Munassib Depression followed in late August. While the attack was successfully carried out and the objective seized, some elements of the battalion carried on the attack deeper into enemy lines. At one stage, it was feared that these elements would be cut off but Baker was able to withdraw his men to their proper positions. Once again, at the conclusion of the operation, the exploits of Baker&#x27;s command were recognised.

The battalion then fought in the Second Battle of El Alamein. Initially used to mop up behind the two brigades bearing the brunt of the New Zealand attack, it was decided that the battalion would be used for Operation &quot;Supercharge&quot;. This attack, to be launched on 2 November, was designed to breach the German lines and establish a corridor through which British armour could break out from Alamein. His battalion subordinate to the British 151 Infantry Brigade for the operation, Baker was unhappy with the lack of detail in the planning of the operation. On arriving at the starting line for his unit, he found Australian units in the wrong positions and convinced their commanding brigadier to move them. Within minutes of the commencement of the attack, he was wounded in the face. His wounds, to his mouth and tongue, were serious and he was repatriated to New Zealand where he would spend nearly a year in extensive rehabilitation. His exploits as commander of the 28th Battalion were recognised with an award of the Distinguished Service Order, which was gazetted in 1944.

==Later life==
In November 1943, after recovering from his war wounds, Baker was appointed head of the newly formed Rehabilitation Department. The department was charged with establishing ex-servicemen and women into civilian life by providing them with finance, training and housing. Māori soldiers returning to New Zealand after service in the First World War had found rehabilitation policies at the time discriminated against them. Baker advocated and worked for equal treatment for Pākehā (people of European descent) and Māori soldiers returning from the Second World War, setting up a dedicated committee for Māori. Despite the department being amalgamated into the Department of Internal Affairs in 1954, he continued in his rehabilitation role. He was also a Public Services Commissioner from September 1954 until his death in 1958 from a heart attack. He is buried in the servicemen&#x27;s section of Wellington&#x27;s Karori Cemetery.

<text>San José City College (SJCC) is a public community college in San Jose, California. It was founded in 1921, and is one of the oldest colleges in the California Community College System.

==History==

The college was founded in 1921, opening its doors as San Jose Junior College to students in September of that year.

In 1953, San José Unified School District took over the college&#x27;s operation from San José State University. The college moved to its present location in the Fruitdale neighborhood of West San Jose in the same year. The college&#x27;s name changed to &quot;San José City College&quot; in 1958.

In 1999, 2004 and 2010, voters within the San José-Evergreen Community College District passed bond measures to re-build the campus and provide modern technology and facilities for the students, which resulted in the construction of buildings like César E. Chávez Library, the Science Complex, Carmen Castellano Fine Arts Center, and the SJCC Student Center.

==Campus==

SJCC&#x27;s campus is located in West San Jose, in the neighborhood of Fruitdale. It is bound by Bascom Ave to the west, Leigh Ave to the east, and Moorpark Ave to the north.

Notable buildings on campus include César E. Chávez Library, the Science Complex, the Student Center, Carmen Castellano Fine Arts Center, and the Technology Center, among others.

===César E. Chávez Library===
The new library opened in June 2003. It was named after Californian civil rights activist César E. Chávez. The library is state-of-the-art with wireless Internet access and data ports throughout the building.

It also has an electronic research laboratory consisting of 30 personal computers, an electronic whiteboard and a variety of learning software.

===Carmen Castellano Fine Arts Center===
The Carmen Castellano Fine Arts Center was opened in 2012. It is named after longtime local arts booster and community organizer Carmen Castellano. The center includes a fine arts gallery and a theatre/performance space, alongside classrooms for relevant departments.

===KJCC===
KJCC 104.1 FM is an online and very low power FM radio station run by San Jose City College students. KJCC began in 1978, then in fall 1994, radio classes were cancelled due to budget cuts, and has since been operated by campus clubs.

==Athletics==

San Jose City College is home to Jagsports. A $1.7 million capital improvements plan includes a new weight and fitness training complex which is open now to all students, and contains weight and cardiovascular equipment.

During the 1970s, SJCC was a major training hub for Olympic track and field athletes. Under the supervision of coach Bert Bonanno, Caitlyn Jenner (known as Bruce Jenner prior to her transition) trained eight hours per day at the track before he won the 1976 Olympic decathlon. Alumni Millard Hampton and Andre Phillips both won Olympic gold medals, with coaching assistance from Bobby Poynter who was a part of San Jose State University&#x27;s &quot;Speed City&quot; track team, and was also their coach and teacher at Silver Creek High School (California). The throwing facilities, in particular, were home to gold medalist Mac Wilkins, Al Feuerbach and John Powell. All three became world record holders, Wilkins and Feuerbach setting their records at San Jose City College. Following Jenner&#x27;s victory in Montreal, Bonanno created the Bruce Jenner Invitational, one of the top domestic meets for top-level athletes. It was an annual televised stop, equivalent with today&#x27;s Prefontaine Classic. He also used Hampton and Phillips&#x27; names to create a local high school invitational.

In 1984 and 1987, the San Jose City College track was host to the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

In February 2018, men&#x27;s basketball head coach Percy Carr became the all-time winningest black head coach in college basketball history.

<text>You Were Here is an album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer, released in 2000.

==Background==
&quot;You Were Here&quot; was Harmer&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in Canada after years of almost reaching the pop charts with Weeping Tile. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Basement Apt.&quot;, had previously been a Weeping Tile song, appearing on that band&#x27;s 1995 release &quot;eepee&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Your Back Up&quot;, had previously been recorded by Harmer with The Saddletramps. Three other songs, &quot;Weakened State&quot;, &quot;Lodestar&quot; and &quot;Coffee Stain&quot;, had also been previously recorded by Weeping Tile, on 1998&#x27;s &quot;This Great Black Night&quot;.

Harmer stated &quot;I always had kind of high expectations for You Were Here, but I was holding onto it for as long as I could, to find a proper, appropriate home.&quot; She self-financed and self-released the album on her own Cold Snap Records label before it was licensed by Zoë Records and Universal Music Canada.

Harmer appeared in support of the album on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on October 2, 2001, in an appearance in which stage manager Biff Henderson jumped in to sing impromptu backing vocals. She had originally been scheduled to appear the previous week, but was bumped when Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s first post-9/11 appearance ran overtime.

The album&#x27;s title track is a tribute to her former Weeping Tile bandmate Joe Chithalen, who died in 1999.

The Art Of Time Ensemble featuring Sarah Slean recorded a Roberto Occhipinti arrangement of &quot;Lodestar&quot; on their 2009 album &quot;Black Flowers&quot;.

==Reception==

The album was warmly received. &quot;TIME&quot; ranked &quot;You Were Here&quot; in its year-end Top Ten list, calling it the year&#x27;s best debut album.

&quot;You Were Here&quot; was named the 24th greatest Canadian album of all time in Bob Mersereau&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;.

Music critic Lisa M. Smith, writing for Allmusic, praised the album, and wrote of Harmer that &quot;it is certain that she is an artist choosing wisely from a great scope of colors. With a pleasing and misleading start, the rollicking opening track asserts its individuality with a Vaudevillian clarinet, keeping one foot in Kinks pop and one in some elusive species of country rock.&quot; She describes the album as one of a pleasing ebb and flow. &quot;Songs may begin with a soft acoustic, then unfold assuredly toward their climax. Various instruments add character now and then, such as a muted trumpet or a harmonica, and the energy level can sway between a lullaby and full pop treatment with a definite destination… the album as a whole feels sincere, answering to a variety of moods and whims. It is a work of quality, from the songwriting clear to the production.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 3.5 of 5 stars, stating it contained &quot;Plainly hooky, tender-but-tough songs...Harmer lovingly chronicles the rough-and-tumble of real-life romance...a marvelously compelling meditation&quot;

&quot;Q&quot; gave &quot;You Were Here&quot; 3 of 5 stars and called it &quot;Lounge jazz, drum loops and lead guitar chops support a vocalist whose lyrical panache...marks her out from the crowd.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;No Depression&quot;, Paul Cantin called it &quot;a welcome break from the Lilith school of flinchy girl singers. Her music is at once heartfelt and hardy, sensitive and sanguine.&quot;

<doc id="1284618" wikidata="Q3985103" url="?curid=1284618" title="Hemagglutination assay">
<text>The hemagglutination assay or haemagglutination assay (HA) and the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI or HAI) were developed in 1941–42 by American virologist George Hirst as methods for quantifying the relative concentration of viruses, bacteria, or antibodies.

HA and HAI apply the process of hemagglutination, in which sialic acid receptors on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs) bind to the hemagglutinin glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza virus (and several other viruses) and create a network, or lattice structure, of interconnected RBCs and virus particles. The agglutinated lattice maintains the RBCs in a suspended distribution, typically viewed as a diffuse reddish solution. The formation of the lattice depends on the concentrations of the virus and RBCs, and when the relative virus concentration is too low, the RBCs are not constrained by the lattice and settle to the bottom of the well. Hemagglutination is observed in the presence of staphylococci, vibrios, and other bacterial species, similar to the mechanism viruses use to cause agglutination of erythrocytes. The RBCs used in HA and HI assays are typically from chickens, turkeys, horses, guinea pigs, or humans depending on the selectivity of the targeted virus or bacterium and the associated surface receptors on the RBC.

==Procedure==
A general procedure for HA is as follows, a serial dilution of virus is prepared across the rows in a U or V- bottom shaped 96-well microtiter plate. The most concentrated sample in the first well is often diluted to be 1/5x of the stock, and subsequent wells are typically two-fold dilutions (1/10, 1/20, 1/40, etc.).The final well serves as a negative control with no virus. Each row of the plate typically has a different virus and the same pattern of dilutions. After serial dilutions, a standardized concentration of RBCs is added to each well and mixed gently. The plate is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following the incubation period, the assay can be analyzed to distinguish between agglutinated and non-agglutinated wells. The images across a row will typically progress from agglutinated wells with high virus concentration and a diffuse reddish appearance to a series of wells with low virus concentrations containing a dark red pellet, or button, in the center of the well. The low concentration wells appear nearly identical to the no-virus negative control well. The button appearance occurs because the RBCs are not held in the agglutinated lattice structure and settle into the low point of the U or V-bottom well. The transition from agglutinated to non-agglutinated wells occurs distinctively, within 1 to 2 wells.

The relative concentration, or titer, of the virus sample is based on the well with the last agglutinated appearance, immediately before a pellet is observed. Relative to the initial viral stock concentration, the virus concentration in this well will be some dilution of the stock, for example, 1/40-fold. The titer value of that sample is the inverse of the dilution, i.e., 40. In some cases, the virus is initially so dilute that agglutinated wells are never observed. In that case, the titer of these samples is commonly assigned as 5, indicating the highest possible concentration, but the accuracy of that value is clearly low. Alternatively, if the relative concentration of the virus is extremely high and the wells never transition to a button appearance. The titer value is then commonly assigned to be the highest dilution, such as 5120.

HI is closely related to the HA assay, but includes anti-viral antibodies as “inhibitors” to interfere with the virus-RBC interaction. The goal is to characterize the concentration of antibodies in the antiserum or other samples containing antibodies. The HI assay is generally performed by creating a dilution series of antiserum across the rows of a 96-well microtiter plate. Each row would usually be a different sample. A standardized amount of virus or bacteria is added to each well, and the mixture is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. The last well in each row would be a negative control with no virus added. During the incubation, antibodies bind to the viral particles, and if the concentration and binding affinity of the antibodies are high enough, the viral particles are effectively blocked from causing hemagglutination. Next, a standardized amount of RBCs is added to each well and allowed to incubate at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes. The resulting HI plate images usually progress from non-agglutinated, “button” wells with high antibody concentration to agglutinated, red diffuse wells with low antibody concentration. The HI titer value is the inverse of the last dilution of serum that completely inhibited hemagglutination.

The preceding descriptions of the HA and HI processes are generalized, and specific details can vary depending on the operator and laboratory. For example, serial dilutions across the rows is described, but some laboratories use an alternate orientation and perform dilutions down the columns instead. Similarly, the starting dilution, serial dilution factor, incubation times, and choice of U or V-bottom plate can depend on the specific laboratory.

==Advantages==
HA and HI have the advantages that the assays are simple, use relatively inexpensive and available instruments and supplies, and provide results within a few hours. The assays are also well established in many laboratories around the world, allowing some measure of credibility, comparison, and standardization.

==Limitations==
Optimal and reliable results require controlling several variables, such as incubation times, red blood cell concentration, and type of red blood cell. Non-specific factors in the sample can lead to interference and incorrect titer values. For example, molecules in the sample other than virus-specific antibodies can inhibit agglutination between virus and RBCs, as well as potentially blocking antibody from binding to virus. Receptor-destroying enzymes (RDE) are commonly used to treat samples prior to analysis to prevent non-specific inhibition. Analysis of the HA or HI results relies on a qualified individual to read the plate and determine the titer values. The manual interpretation method introduces more opportunities for discrepancies in the assay because results can be subjective and the agreement between human readers is inconsistent. Also, there is no digital record of the plate or titer determinations so the initial interpretation is tedious and commonly done in replicates. The range of potential variables and differences between expert readers can make comparing inter-laboratory results difficult.

<doc id="1284642" wikidata="Q7966964" url="?curid=1284642" title="Wamsutta Oil Refinery">
<text>Wamsutta Oil Refinery was established around 1861 in McClintocksville in Venango County near Oil City, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It was the first business enterprise of Henry Huttleston Rogers (1840–1909), who became a famous businessman, industrialist and financier.

== Whale oil and petroleum compete ==

Prior to the second half of the 19th century, whale oil was the primary source of fuel for lighting in the United States. The whaling industry was the mainstay for many New England coastal communities for over 200 years. Among these was Fairhaven, Massachusetts, founded on land purchased by English settlers of the Plymouth Colony from an Indian chief and his son, who was named Wamsutta.

In 1854, natural oil (petroleum) was discovered in western Pennsylvania. In 1859, George Bissell and Edwin L. Drake made the first successful use of a drilling rig at Titusville, Pennsylvania. This single well soon exceeded the entire cumulative oil output which had taken place in Europe since the 1650s. The principal product of the oil was kerosene. Another related product was natural gas. Kerosene and natural gas soon replaced whale oil in North America. In New England, whaling reached its peak in 1857, then gradually began a period of decline. The situation was aggravated considerably by the American Civil War, as whaling vessels and crews were diverted to assist in blockading the Confederate coastal areas and ports. By 1900, the whaling industry had collapsed, due in part to the discovery and refining of petroleum from the western Pennsylvania oil fields.

== Henry H. Rogers ==

Perhaps realizing both the trend and opportunity, in 1861, in Fairhaven, 21-year-old Henry Huttleston Rogers pooled his savings of approximately $600 with a friend, Charles H. Ellis. They set out to western Pennsylvania and its newly discovered oil fields. The young partners began their small Wamsutta Oil Refinery at McClintocksville, Pennsylvania, near Oil City. The name &quot;Wamsutta&quot; was apparently selected in honor of their hometown area of Fairhaven, Massachusetts, in New England. Wamsutta was the son of a Native American chief who negotiated an early alliance with the English settlers of the Plymouth Colony in the 17th century. The name chosen for the new refinery may also have derived from the Wamsutta Company in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Opened in 1846, it was a major employer. (The Wamsutta Company was the first of many textile mills that gradually came to supplant whaling as the principal employer in New Bedford).

Rogers and Ellis, and their Wamsutta Oil Refinery, made $30,000 their first year. This amount was more than 3 entire whaling ship trips from back home could hope to earn during an average voyage of more than a year&#x27;s duration. He was regarded as very successful when Rogers returned home to Fairhaven for a short vacation the next year. There, in 1862, he married his childhood sweetheart, Abbie Palmer Gifford. Abbie returned with him to the oil fields where they lived in a one-room shack along Oil Creek, and he and Ellis worked the Wamsutta Oil Refinery.

== Charles Pratt ==

Rogers met Charles Pratt a short time later. Pratt (1830–1891) had been born in Watertown, Massachusetts. In nearby Boston, he had joined a company specializing in paints and whale oil products. In 1850 or 1851, Pratt came to New York City, where he worked for a similar company handling paint and oil.

Charles Pratt had seen the same trend as Ellis and Rogers and became a pioneer of the natural oil (petroleum) industry. He established a kerosene refinery Astral Oil Works in Brooklyn, New York. Pratt&#x27;s product later gave rise to the slogan, &quot;The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil&quot;.

In Pennsylvania in the mid-1860s, Pratt met Ellis and Rogers. Pratt had earlier bought whale-oil from Ellis in Fairhaven. The two young men agreed to sell the entire output of their small refinery to Pratt&#x27;s company at a fixed price.

Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt. A few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs struggled to try to live up to their contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to Pratt.

Charles Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Rogers went to Pratt in New York City, and told him he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. This so impressed Pratt that he hired 26-year-old Rogers immediately. In the next few years Rogers became, in the words of Elbert Hubbard, Pratt&#x27;s &quot;hands and feet and eyes and ears&quot; (&quot;Little Journeys to the Homes&quot;, 1909). The following year, in 1867, Charles Pratt joined with his protégé Rogers to form Charles Pratt and Company.

== Standard Oil, Henry Rogers as a tycoon and philanthropist ==

Pratt&#x27;s companies (and he and Rogers) became part of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil in 1874. After joining Standard Oil, Rogers invested heavily in various industries, including copper, steel, mining, and railways. The Virginian Railway is widely considered his final life&#x27;s achievement. Rogers amassed a great fortune, estimated at over $100 million, and became one of the wealthiest men in the United States. He was also a generous philanthropist, providing many public works for his hometown of Fairhaven and financially assisting such notables as Mark Twain, Helen Keller, and Booker T. Washington.

== Pennsylvania oil heritage ==
Near McClintocksville and Oil City, in western Pennsylvania, Oil Creek State Park and many heritage sites to tell the story and memorialize the people of the oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

<text>Songs for Clem is an album by Canadian singer-songwriter by Sarah Harmer, credited to Harmer and Jason Euringer, and released in 1999.

==History==
The album was never intended by Harmer for widespread release, but as a 1998 Christmas gift for her father, Clem Harmer. It features Harmer&#x27;s personal, home-recorded renditions of several of her father&#x27;s favourite pop and country standards. Upon hearing the recording, Harmer&#x27;s friends and family convinced her to release it independently. She did so in 1999; following her commercial breakthrough in 2000 with &quot;You Were Here&quot;, the album was re-released under Harmer&#x27;s new major label distribution deal with Universal Music Canada.

Clem Harmer subsequently appeared on Sarah&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;I&#x27;m A Mountain&quot;, contributing backing vocals to two songs.

==Reception==

Allmusic music critic Johnny Lofthus wrote the album feels &quot;lovingly handmade, with cover art right out of a child&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day art project and an immediate, field-type recording quality that features accompaniment from crickets and a passing rainstorm. This isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s lo-fi; on the contrary, it&#x27;s crystal clear.&quot; and that &quot;... it&#x27;s a true sentimental journey for people inspired by their parents to love music.&quot;

<doc id="1284654" wikidata="Q3110069" url="?curid=1284654" title="Golden Hawks">
<text>The Golden Hawks were a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) aerobatic flying team established in 1959 to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the RCAF and the &quot;Golden&quot; 50th anniversary of Canadian flight, which began with the AEA Silver Dart in 1909.

==History==

Initially, a six-plane team was envisioned as performing for only one year with the Canadair Sabre 5. The Golden Hawks originally had eight pilots led by Squadron Leader Fern Villeneuve, but the Golden Hawks were so popular after their 1959 show season that the team was re-established for 1960. The team, under the command of W/C Jack Allan, and the lead of S/L Villeneuve, included pilots: F/L James McCombe, F/L Edward Rozdeba, F/L Jeb Kerr, F/L Ralph Annis, F/L Sam Eisler, F/O Jim Holt and F/O William (Bill) Stewart.

In 1961, F/L McCombe became the leader of the team, as Villeneuve left the team when he married. Two deaths altered the makeup of the team: F/O John T. Price joined the Hawks in 1959 after F/O Eisler died, and served as second solo. When F/L Kerr died in a crash in Calgary, F/O John T. Price moved to lead solo.

F/O Stewart&#x27;s routine as lead solo was often the one most remembered since his low-level aerobatics looked to the crowd to be particularly dangerous. The Golden Hawks continued performing for three more seasons until they were disbanded, ostensibly for financial reasons, on February 7, 1964, having flown a total of 317 shows across North America.

Not only did the team perform standard loops and rolls in very tight formation, they also introduced their own trademark maneuvers. The Golden Hawks pioneered a two-aircraft head-on coordinated solo program which virtually every military team since has adopted in various ways. They also invented the Card 5 Maneuver, where five aircraft fly in a card formation, two up front, one in the middle, two in the back. They also created the Coordinated Two Aircraft 360, where two aircraft fly in opposite directions at low level at about , at about seven gravities, in a horizontal circle and pass each other on both sides of the circle.

The legacy of the Golden Hawks lives on with the Canadian Forces Snowbirds.

==Accidents and incidents==

* 12 March 1959: A Golden Hawks Sabre crashed into a wooded area near RCAF Station Chatham while practising a co-solo routine, killing F/L Sam Eisler.
* 21 June 1959: A solo Golden Hawk Sabre piloted by F/L J.T. Price was struck by a bird over Bedford Basin, Halifax, Nova Scotia, shattering the windscreen and canopy. Although the pilot&#x27;s helmet visor was torn away and his vision was temporarily impaired, F/L Price was able to land safely with the assistance of F/L R.H. Annis, the other solo pilot.
* 10 August 1959: A Golden Hawks Sabre landing at McCall Airfield, Calgary, Alberta, with the rest of the team collided with a Piper Tri-Pacer while turning base leg about west of the field. The Sabre pilot, F/L Jeb Kerr, and two occupants of the Pacer were killed. The Pacer had not been authorized to enter the control zone.
* 22 February 1961: Golden Hawks Sabre pilot F/O Jim McCann was killed during formation practice after the right wing of his aircraft was severely damaged during a collision with another Sabre.
* April 1961: Golden Hawks pilot F/O Bill Stewart ejected at low altitude during a practice routine near Chatham because of an engine malfunction.

==Aircraft on display==
Original Golden Hawks aircraft are found in several locations including Canadair Sabre 6 #23651 on display at the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Mount Hope, Ontario. The original Golden Hawks Sabre 6 is on loan from the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, and is displayed with Plexiglas panels on the port side. The National Air Force Museum of Canada has a Golden Hawks Canadair Sabre 6 (#23641) that was formerly mounted on a pylon at CFB Mountainview and is now on display at CFB Trenton, Ontario. Canadian Sabre 5 #23355 that was flown by the Golden Hawks is on display at the Atlantic Canada Aviation Museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after being originally dedicated in 1986 as a gate guardian at the former CFB Chatham, and ultimately restored at the museum. A Canadair Sabre 6 painted as (#23042) that flew with the Golden Hawks is also on display at the Technik Museum Speyer in Speyer (Rhineland-Palatinate), Germany.

In 2009, Canadair T-33 &quot;133500&quot; Golden Hawk Support Aircraft was acquired by the Jet Aircraft Museum.

Golden Hawks aircraft serial number 23053 resides at Zwick’s Park in Belleville, Ontario.

Serial number 23164 resides at Germain Park in Sarnia, Ontario, and was refurbished in 2014.
==Tributes and honours==
In Oakville, Ontario, 540 &quot;Golden Hawks&quot; Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadron is named for the air demonstration team. After their formation in 1951, the squadron chose to petition the Canadian federal government in 1964 to assume the RCAF unit&#x27;s name and identity as its own. The Department of National Defence granted permission in 1968 and since that time, 540 RCAC Squadron &quot;has been proud to officially carry the Golden Hawks name.&quot;

At the former home base for the team, the Junior A hockey team in Trenton, Ontario, takes its name from the Golden Hawks. The symbol of the team features a Sabre jet outlined in gold. Similarly, the Chatham-Kent Secondary School sport teams in southern Ontario all take the name Golden Hawks.

In 2009, &quot;Hawk One&quot;, a fully refurbished Canadair Sabre 5 (#23314) in Golden Hawk colours owned by Vintage Wings of Canada, helped to celebrate the Centennial of Flight in Canada.

<doc id="1284656" wikidata="Q6947340" url="?curid=1284656" title="Myeloperoxidase deficiency">
<text>Myeloperoxidase deficiency is a disorder featuring lack in either the quantity or the function of myeloperoxidase–an iron-containing protein expressed primarily in neutrophil granules. There are two types of myeloperoxidase deficiency: primary/inherited and secondary/acquired. Lack of functional myeloperoxidase leads to less efficient killing of intracellular pathogens, particularly &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, as well as less efficient production and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) from the neutrophils to trap and kill extracellular pathogens. Despite these characteristics, more than 95% of individuals with myeloperoxidase deficiency experience no symptoms in their lifetime. For those who do experience symptoms, the most common symptom is frequent infections by Candida albicans. Individuals with myeloperoxidase deficiency also experience higher rates of chronic inflammatory conditions. Myeloperoxidase deficiency is diagnosed using flow cytometry or cytochemical stains. There is no treatment for myeloperoxidase deficiency itself. Rather, in the rare cases that individuals experience symptoms, these infections should be treated. 
== Pathophysiology ==
The innate immune system responds quickly to infection, with neutrophils (a type of white blood cells) being the first responders. Neutrophils enter the site of infection and begin to phagocytose (take up) pathogens. Once engulfed, the neutrophils must then degrade the captured pathogens–a process known as intracellular killing. 

One method of intracellular killing which takes place in the phagolysosomes of neutrophils involves the reaction of myeloperoxidase with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acquired in the cells from NADPH oxidase through the respiratory bursts. This reaction generates several acidic products including hypochlorous acid (HClO), which can break down pathogens. Bacteria such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and fungi such as &quot;Candida albicans&quot; are killed in this manner. 

Neutrophils are also involved in killing extracellular pathogens (pathogens outside of the cell) through the release of NETs. These NETs contain myeloperoxidase, among other antimicrobial proteins. Once released outside of the cell, NETs trap pathogens and may in some cases kill them. Although myeloperoxidase is not required for all NET formation/release, NETs are only formed and released in response to &quot;Candida albicans&quot; when myeloperoxidase is present. Myeloperoxidase proteins in NETs can still react with H2O2 to form HClO and break down some extracellular pathogens. In myeloperoxidase deficient individuals, this extracellular pathogen killing doesn’t typically occur. 

Finally, during infection, neutrophils can migrate to the lymph nodes, where they deposit myeloperoxidase. Although the mechanisms of this process aren’t well understood, there is evidence that this extracellular myeloperoxidase interacts with dendritic cells (cells of the adaptive immune system) in the lymph nodes, leading to a decrease in adaptive immune system activity in response to infection.

==Presentation==
About 1:1,000 to 1:4,000 individuals in the United States and Europe and 1:55,000 individuals in Japan experience myeloperoxidase deficiency. The most common symptom of myeloperoxidase deficiency is frequent infections, particularly by the fungus &quot;Candida albicans&quot;. This symptom is especially frequent in individuals who also experience diabetes mellitus. 

The majority of myeloperoxidase-deficient individuals, however, do not display any significant tendencies towards chronic infections from most bacteria. This is likely due to the fact that the absence of myeloperoxidase leads to increased neutrophil phagocytosis and degranulation as well as increased development of the adaptive immune system. That is, other aspects of the immune system typically compensate for the lack of myeloperoxidase, leading to relatively mild symptoms. 

Nonetheless, myeloperoxidase-deficient individuals have been found to experience more chronic inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary/skin inflammation, kidney/heart disease, etc.)  than individuals with sufficient myeloperoxidase. Researchers hypothesize this may be a result of heightened adaptive immune system activity in individuals with myeloperoxidase deficiency. There is also some evidence that congenital myeloperoxidase deficiency is correlated with higher rates of malignant tumors.

== Types ==
MPO deficiency is broken down into two categories: primary/congenital and secondary/acquired. Primary MPO deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which is caused by mutations in the myeloperoxidase gene on chromosome 17q23. There are several different known mutations of this gene which all lead to myeloperoxidase deficiency. 

Secondary MPO deficiency, on the other hand, occurs in various clinical situations as a result of hematological neoplasm, disseminated cancers, some drugs, iron deficiency, lead intoxication, thrombotic disease, renal transplantation, severe infectious disease, diabetes mellitus, neuronal lipofuscinosis, or pregnancy. Secondary MPO deficiency is typically partial, meaning only a portion of the affected individual’s neutrophils lack functional myeloperoxidase.

==Diagnosis==
Myeloperoxidase deficiency can be diagnosed via flow cytometry and cytochemical stains. Various devices can divide up leukocyte (white blood cell) populations based on their size and peroxidase activity. Specific stains bind to myeloperoxidase, and individuals who display large, granulated cells without this stain through flow cytometry typically have myeloperoxidase deficiency. In this way, it’s apparent when neutrophils are present in an individual but peroxidase activity is absent. 

Note, myeloperoxidase deficiency can cause false positives in the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease, a condition which includes dysfunctional NADPH oxidase. Both disorders interfere with neutrophils’ abilities to kill pathogens through reaction with oxidative species. However, chronic granulomatous disease leads to inadequate H2O2 production, while myeloperoxidase deficiency is characterized by a lack of myeloperoxidase to interact with present H2O2. Testing with NADPH oxidase-specific assays can lead to positive results for chronic granulomatous disease and negative results for myeloperoxidase deficiency. 

==Treatment==
Most individuals with myeloperoxidase deficiency do not need regular treatment, as they experience only mild symptoms, if any at all. Continued antibiotic use is not recommended in myeloperoxidase-deficient patients who don’t experience recurrent infections. 

Acquired myeloperoxidase deficiency typically goes away when the underlying condition is treated. In particular, when myeloperoxidase deficiency is caused by severe iron deficiency, treatment with iron returns myeloperoxidase function to normal.

<text>France Football is a French monthly magazine containing football news from all over the world. It is considered to be one of the most reputable sports publications in Europe, mostly because of its photographic reports, in-depth and exclusive interviews and accurate statistics of the UEFA Champions League matches, and extensive coverage of the European leagues. The magazine was first published in 1946 and is headquartered in Paris. For more than six decades it has presented the Ballon d&#x27;Or award to the best football player of the year.

== Awards ==
Since 1956, &quot;France Football&quot; presents the Ballon d&#x27;Or (), initially referred to as the &quot;European Footballer of the Year&quot; award. Following the award&#x27;s merger with the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 2010, the magazine awarded the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or to the world&#x27;s best player in partnership with FIFA, the sport&#x27;s governing body, until 2016, when it resumed full ownership of the trophy. Since 1959, &quot;France Football&quot; also elects the French Player of the Year and awarded the best club team in Europe since 1968 to 1990.

<text>A houseboy (alternatively spelled as ) is a term which refers to a typically male domestic worker or personal assistant who performs cleaning and other forms of personal chores. The term has a record of being used in the British Empire, military slang, and the male LGBT community.

==United Kingdom==
Historically, houseboy was a term used in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for a male domestic servant. He was usually, but not always, a native person who worked for a British family living in the non-British regions of the empire. A female housecleaner was termed a housegirl. Both sexes often wore uniform, due to their status as domestic servants.

== Military slang ==
Houseboy was also used as an American slang term originating in the Second World War for a young teenager who helped American soldiers perform basic responsibilities like cleaning, laundry, ironing, shoe-shining, running errands, etc. The British English term for this occupation was &#x27;Batman&#x27;.

== Gay slang ==
A houseboy, as used by members of the LGBT community, refers to a young man who performs domestic work, where the employment normally has an erotic, though not necessarily sexual, aspect.

<doc id="1284664" wikidata="Q378132" url="?curid=1284664" title="Big Five personality traits">
<text>In trait theory, the Big Five personality traits (sometimes known as the five-factor model of personality or OCEAN or CANOE models) are a group of five characteristics used to study personality:
* openness to experience, intellect, or imagination (imaginative/philosophical vs. uncreative/unintellectual)
* conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. haphazard/careless)
* extraversion or surgency (bold/energetic vs. shy/bashful)
* agreeableness (sympathetic/cooperative vs. cold/competitive)
* neuroticism or low emotional stability (moody/nervous vs. relaxed/calm)

The Big Five traits did not arise from studying an existing theory of personality, but rather, they were an empirical finding in early lexical studies that English personality-descriptive adjectives clustered together under factor analysis into five unique factors. The factor analysis indicates that these five factors can be measured, but further studies have suggested revisions and critiques of the model. Cross-language studies have found a sixth Honesty-Humility factor, suggesting a replacement by the HEXACO model of personality structure. A study of short-form constructs found that the agreeableness and openness constructs were ill-defined in a larger population, suggesting that these traits should be dropped and replaced by more specific dimensions. In addition, the labels such as &quot;neuroticism&quot; are ill-fitting, and the traits are more properly thought of as unnamed dimensions, &quot;Factor A&quot;, &quot;Factor B&quot;, and so on.

Despite these issues with its formulation, the five-factor approach has been enthusiastically and internationally embraced, becoming central to much of contemporary personality research. Many subsequent factor analyses, variously formulated and expressed in a variety of languages, have repeatedly reported the finding of five largely similar factors. The five-factor approach has been portrayed as a fruitful, scientific achievement―a fundamental advance in the understanding of human personality. Some have claimed that the five factors of personality are &quot;an empirical fact, like the fact that there are seven continents on earth and eight American Presidents from Virginia&quot;. Others such as Jack Block have expressed concerns over the uncritical acceptance of the approach.

==History==
William McDougall, writing in 1932, put forward a conjecture observing that &quot;five distinguishable but separable factors&quot; could be identified when looking at personality. His suggestions, &quot;intellect, character, temperament, disposition and temper&quot;, have been seen as &quot;anticipating&quot; the adoption of the Big Five model in subsequent years. The model was built on understanding the relationship between personality and academic behaviour. It was defined by several independent sets of researchers who analysed words describing people&#x27;s behaviour. These researchers first studied relationships between many words related to personality traits. They made lists of these words shorter by 5–10 times and then used factor analysis to group the remaining traits (with data mostly based upon people&#x27;s estimations, in self-report questionnaires and peer ratings) to find the basic factors of personality.

The initial model was advanced in 1958 by Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal, research psychologists at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, but failed to reach scholars and scientists until the 1980s. In 1990, J.M. Digman advanced his five-factor model of personality, which Lewis Goldberg put at the highest organised level. These five overarching domains have been found to contain most known personality traits and are assumed to represent the basic structure behind them all.

At least four sets of researchers have worked independently for decades to reflect personality traits in language and have mainly identified the same five factors: Tupes and Christal were first, followed by Goldberg at the Oregon Research Institute, Cattell at the University of Illinois, and finally Costa and McCrae. These four sets of researchers used somewhat different methods in finding the five traits, making the sets of five factors have varying names and meanings. However, all have been found to be strongly correlated with their corresponding factors. Studies indicate that the Big Five traits are not nearly as powerful in predicting and explaining actual behaviour as the more numerous facets or primary traits.

Each of the Big Five personality traits contains two separate, but correlated, aspects reflecting a level of personality below the broad domains but above the many facet scales also making up part of the Big Five. The aspects are labelled as follows: Volatility and Withdrawal for Neuroticism; Enthusiasm and Assertiveness for Extraversion; Intellect and Openness for Openness to Experience; Industriousness and Orderliness for Conscientiousness; and Compassion and Politeness for Agreeableness.

=== Finding the five factors ===
In 1884, British scientist Sir Francis Galton became the first person known to consider deriving a comprehensive taxonomy of human personality traits by sampling language. The idea that this may be possible is known as the lexical hypothesis. In 1936, American psychologists Gordon Allport of Harvard University and Henry Odbert of Dartmouth College implemented Galton&#x27;s hypothesis. They organised for three anonymous people to categorise adjectives from Webster&#x27;s New International Dictionary and a list of common slang words. The result was a list of 4504 adjectives they believed were descriptive of observable and relatively permanent traits.

In 1943, Raymond Cattell of Harvard University took Allport and Odbert&#x27;s list and reduced this to a list of roughly 160 terms by eliminating words with very similar meanings. To these, he added terms from 22 other psychological categories, and additional &quot;interest&quot; and &quot;abilities&quot; terms. This resulted in a list of 171 traits. From this he used factor analysis to derive 60 &quot;personality clusters or syndromes&quot; and an additional 7 minor clusters. Cattell then narrowed this down to 35 terms, and later added a 36th factor in the form of an IQ measure. Through factor analysis from 1945 to 1948, he created 11 or 12 factor solutions.

In 1947, Hans Eysenck of University College London published his book &quot;Dimensions of Personality&quot;. He posited that the two most important personality dimensions were &quot;Extraversion&quot; and &quot;Neuroticism&quot;, a term that he coined.

In July 1949, Donald Fiske of the University of Chicago used 22 terms either adapted from Cattell&#x27;s 1947 study, and through surveys of male university students and statistics derived five factors: &quot;Social Adaptability&quot;, &quot;Emotional Control&quot;, &quot;Conformity&quot;, &quot;Inquiring Intellect&quot;, and &quot;Confident Self-expression&quot;. In the same year, Cattell, with Maurice Tatsuoka and Herbert Eber, found 4 additional factors, which they believed consisted of information that could only be provided through self-rating. With this understanding, they created the sixteen factor 16PF Questionnaire.

In 1953, John W French of Educational Testing Service published an extensive meta-analysis of personality trait factor studies.

In 1957, Ernest Tupes of the United States Air Force undertook a personality trait study of US Air Force officers. Each was rated by their peers using Cattell&#x27;s 35 terms (or in some cases, the 30 most reliable terms). In 1958, Tupes and Raymond Christal began a US Air Force study by taking 37 personality factors and other data found in Cattell&#x27;s 1947 paper, Fiske&#x27;s 1949 paper, and Tupes&#x27; 1957 paper. Through statistical analysis, they derived five factors they labeled &quot;Surgency&quot;, &quot;Agreeableness&quot;, &quot;Dependability&quot;, &quot;Emotional Stability&quot;, and &quot;Culture&quot;. In addition to the influence of Cattell and Fiske&#x27;s work, they strongly noted the influence of French&#x27;s 1953 study. Tupes and Christal further tested and explained their 1958 work in a 1961 paper.

Warren Norman of the University of Michigan replicated Tupes and Christal&#x27;s work in 1963. He relabeled &quot;Surgency&quot; as &quot;Extroversion or Surgency&quot;, and &quot;Dependability&quot; as &quot;Conscientiousness&quot;. He also found four subordinate scales for each factor. Norman&#x27;s paper was much more read than Tupes and Christal&#x27;s papers had been. Norman&#x27;s later Oregon Research Institute colleague Lewis Goldberg continued this work.

In the 4th edition of the 16PF Questionnaire released in 1968, 5 &quot;global factors&quot; derived from the 16 factors were identified: &quot;Extraversion&quot;, &quot;Independence&quot;, &quot;Anxiety&quot;, &quot;Self-control&quot; and &quot;Tough-mindedness&quot;. 16PF advocates have since called these &quot;the original Big 5&quot;.

===Hiatus in research===
During the 1970s, the changing zeitgeist made publication of personality research difficult. In his 1968 book &quot;Personality and Assessment&quot;, Walter Mischel asserted that personality instruments could not predict behavior with a correlation of more than 0.3. Social psychologists like Mischel argued that attitudes and behavior were not stable, but varied with the situation. Predicting behavior from personality instruments was claimed to be impossible.

===Renewed attention===
In 1978, Paul Costa and Robert McCrae of the National Institutes of Health published a book chapter describing their Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness (NEO) model. The model was based on the three factors in its name. They used Eysenck&#x27;s concept of &quot;Extroversion&quot; rather than Carl Jung&#x27;s. Each factor had six facets. The authors expanded their explanation of the model in subsequent papers.

Also in 1978, British psychologist Peter Saville of Brunel University applied statistical analysis to 16PF results, and determined that the model could be reduced to five factors, &quot;Anxiety&quot;, &quot;Extraversion&quot;, &quot;Warmth&quot;, &quot;Imagination&quot; and &quot;Conscientiousness&quot;.

At a 1980 symposium in Honolulu, Lewis Goldberg, Naomi Takemoto-Chock, Andrew Comrey, and John M. Digman, reviewed the available personality instruments of the day. In 1981, Digman and Takemoto-Chock of the University of Hawaii reanalysed data from Cattell, Tupes, Norman, Fiske and Digman. They re-affirmed the validity of the five factors, naming them &quot;Friendly Compliance vs. Hostile Non-compliance&quot;, &quot;Extraversion vs. Introversion&quot;, &quot;Ego Strength vs. Emotional Disorganization&quot;, &quot;Will to Achieve&quot; and &quot;Intellect&quot;. They also found weak evidence for the existence of a sixth factor, &quot;Culture&quot;.

Peter Saville and his team included the five-factor &quot;Pentagon&quot; model as part of the Occupational Personality Questionnaires (OPQ) in 1984. This was the first commercially available Big Five test. Its factors are &quot;Extroversion&quot;, &quot;Vigorous&quot;, &quot;Methodical&quot;, &quot;Emotional Stability&quot;, and &quot;Abstract&quot;.

This was closely followed by another commercial test, the NEO PI three-factor personality inventory, published by Costa and McCrae in 1985. It used the three NEO factors. The methodology employed in constructing the NEO instruments has since been subject to critical scrutiny.

Emerging methodologies increasingly confirmed personality theories during the 1980s. Though generally failing to predict single instances of behavior, researchers found that they could predict patterns of behavior by aggregating large numbers of observations. As a result, correlations between personality and behavior increased substantially, and it became clear that &quot;personality&quot; did in fact exist.

In 1992, the NEO PI evolved into the NEO PI-R, adding the factors &quot;Agreeableness&quot; and &quot;Conscientiousness&quot;, and becoming a Big Five instrument. This set the names for the factors that are now most commonly used. The NEO maintainers call their model the &quot;Five Factor Model&quot; (FFM). Each NEO personality dimension has six subordinate facets.

=== Subsequent developments ===
Wim Hofstee at the University of Groningen used a lexical hypothesis approach with the Dutch language to develop what became the International Personality Item Pool in the 1990s. Further development in Germany and the United States saw the pool based on three languages. Its questions and results have been mapped to various Big Five personality typing models.

Kibeom Lee and Michael Ashton released a book describing their HEXACO model in 2004. It adds a sixth factor, &quot;Honesty-Humility&quot; to the five (which it calls &quot;Emotionality&quot;, &quot;Extraversion&quot;, &quot;Agreeableness&quot;, &quot;Conscientiousness&quot;, and &quot;Openness to Experience&quot;). Each of these factors has four facets.

In 2007, Colin DeYoung, Lena C. Quilty and Jordan Peterson concluded that the 10 aspects of the Big Five may have distinct biological substrates. This was derived through factor analyses of two data samples with the International Personality Item Pool, followed by cross-correlation with scores derived from 10 genetic factors identified as underlying the shared variance among the Revised NEO Personality Inventory facets.

By 2009, personality and social psychologists generally agreed that both personal and situational variables are needed to account for human behavior.

A FFM-associated test was used by Cambridge Analytica, and was part of the &quot;psychographic profiling&quot; controversy during the 2016 US presidential election.

==Descriptions of the particular personality traits==

When factor analysis is applied to personality survey data, semantic associations between aspects of personality and specific terms are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as &quot;always prepared&quot; rather than &quot;messy&quot;. These associations suggest five broad dimensions used in common language to describe the human personality, temperament, and psyche.

Beneath each proposed global factor, there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors. For example, extraversion is typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions. These traits are not black and white; each one is treated as a spectrum.

===Openness to experience===

Openness to experience is a general appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience. People who are open to experience are intellectually curious, open to emotion, sensitive to beauty, and willing to try new things. They tend to be, when compared to closed people, more creative and more aware of their feelings. They are also more likely to hold unconventional beliefs. Open people can be perceived as unpredictable or lacking focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug-taking. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualisation specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness want to be fulfilled by persevering and are characterised as pragmatic and data-drivensometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualise the openness factor as there is a lack of biological support for this particular trait. Openness has not shown a significant association with any brain regions as opposed to the other four traits which did when using brain imaging to detect changes in volume associated with each trait.

====Sample items====

* I have a rich vocabulary.
*I have a vivid imagination.
*I have excellent ideas.
*I am quick to understand things.
*I use difficult words.
*I spend time reflecting on things.
*I am full of ideas.
*I have difficulty understanding abstract ideas. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
*I am not interested in abstract ideas. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
*I do not have a good imagination. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)

===Conscientiousness===
Conscientiousness is a tendency to be self-disciplined, act dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations. It is related to people&#x27;s level of impulse control, regulation, and direction. High conscientiousness is often perceived as being stubborn and focused. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability. High conscientiousness indicates a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behaviour.

==== Sample items ====
* I am always prepared.
*I pay attention to details.
*I get chores done right away.
*I follow a schedule.
*I am exacting in my work.
*I do not like order. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
*I leave my belongings around. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
*I make a mess of things. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
*I often forget to put things back in their proper place. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
*I shirk my duties. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)

===Extraversion===
Extraversion is characterised by breadth of activities (as opposed to depth), surgency from external activities/situations, and energy creation from external means. The trait is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as energetic. They tend to be enthusiastic and action-oriented. They possess high group visibility, like to talk, and assert themselves. Extraverts may appear more dominant in social settings, as opposed to introverts in that setting.

Introverts have lower social engagement and energy levels than extraverts. They tend to seem quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less involved in the social world. Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression, but as greater independence of their social world than extraverts. Introverts need less stimulation and more time alone than extraverts. This does not mean that they are unfriendly or antisocial; rather, they are aloof and reserved in social situations.

Generally, people are a combination of extraversion and introversion, with personality psychologist Hans Eysenck suggesting a model by which differences in their brains produce these traits.

==== Sample items ====
* I am the life of the party.
* I feel comfortable around people.
* I start conversations.
* I talk to a lot of different people at parties.
*I do not mind being the center of attention.
* I do not talk a lot. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
*I keep in the background. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
*I have little to say. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
* I do not like to draw attention to myself. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
* I am quiet around strangers. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)

===Agreeableness===
Agreeableness is the general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature. Being agreeable helps us cope with stress.

Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally unconcerned with others&#x27; well-being and are less likely to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others&#x27; motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative. Disagreeable people are often competitive or challenging, which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy.

Because agreeableness is a social trait, research has shown that one&#x27;s agreeableness positively correlates with the quality of relationships with one&#x27;s team members. Agreeableness also positively predicts transformational leadership skills. In a study conducted among 169 participants in leadership positions in a variety of professions, individuals were asked to take a personality test and be directly evaluated by supervised subordinates. Very agreeable leaders were more likely to be considered transformational rather than transactional. Although the relationship was not strong (&quot;r=0.32&quot;, &quot;β=0.28&quot;, &quot;p&lt;0.01&quot;), it was the strongest of the Big Five traits. However, the same study could not predict leadership effectiveness as evaluated by the leader&#x27;s direct supervisor.

Conversely, agreeableness has been found to be negatively related to transactional leadership in the military. A study of Asian military units showed that agreeable people are more likely to be poor transactional leaders. Therefore, with further research, organisations may be able to determine an individual&#x27;s potential for performance based on their personality traits. For instance, in their journal article &quot;Which Personality Attributes Are Most Important in the Workplace?&quot; Paul Sackett and Philip Walmsley claim that conscientiousness and agreeableness are &quot;important to success across many different jobs.&quot;

* I insult people. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
* I am not interested in other people&#x27;s problems. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)
* I feel little concern for others. (&quot;Reversed&quot;)

===Neuroticism===
Neuroticism is the tendency to have strong negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression. It is sometimes called emotional instability, or is reversed and referred to as emotional stability. According to Hans Eysenck&#x27;s (1967) theory of personality, neuroticism is associated with low tolerance for stress or a strong dislike of change. Neuroticism is a classic temperament trait that has been studied in temperament research for decades, even before it was adapted by the Five Factor Model.
Neurotic people are emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress. They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening. They can perceive minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional reactions tend to stay for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad mood. For instance, neuroticism is connected to pessimism toward work, to certainty that work hinders personal relationships, and to higher levels of anxiety from the pressures at work. Furthermore, neurotic people may display more skin-conductance reactivity than calm and composed people. These problems in emotional regulation can make a neurotic person think less clearly, make worse decisions, and cope less effectively with stress. Being disappointed with one&#x27;s life achievements can make one more neurotic and increase one&#x27;s chances of falling into clinical depression. Moreover, neurotic individuals tend to experience more negative life events, but neuroticism also changes in response to positive and negative life experiences. Also, neurotic people tend to have worse psychological well-being.

At the other end of the scale, less neurotic individuals are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings; that is related to extraversion instead.

Neuroticism is similar but not identical to being neurotic in the Freudian sense (i.e., neurosis). Some psychologists prefer to call neuroticism by the term emotional instability to differentiate it from the term neurotic in a career test.

==Biological and developmental factors==
The factors that influence a personality are called the determinants of personality. These factors determine the traits which a person develops in the course of development from a child.

===Temperament and personality===

There are debates between temperament researchers and personality researchers as to whether or not biologically based differences define a concept of temperament or a part of personality. The presence of such differences in pre-cultural individuals (such as animals or young infants) suggests that they belong to temperament since personality is a socio-cultural concept. For this reason developmental psychologists generally interpret individual differences in children as an expression of temperament rather than personality. Some researchers argue that temperaments and personality traits are age-specific demonstrations of virtually the same internal qualities. Some believe that early childhood temperaments may become adolescent and adult personality traits as individuals&#x27; basic genetic characteristics interact with their changing environments to various degrees.

Researchers of adult temperament point out that, similarly to sex, age, and mental illness, temperament is based on biochemical systems whereas personality is a product of socialisation of an individual possessing these four types of features. Temperament interacts with socio-cultural factors, but, similar to sex and age, still cannot be controlled or easily changed by these factors.
Therefore, it is suggested that temperament (neurochemically based individual differences) should be kept as an independent concept for further studies and not be confused with personality (culturally-based individual differences, reflected in the origin of the word &quot;persona&quot; (Lat) as a &quot;social mask&quot;).

Moreover, temperament refers to dynamic features of behaviour (energetic, tempo, sensitivity, and emotionality-related), whereas personality is to be considered a psycho-social construct comprising the content characteristics of human behaviour (such as values, attitudes, habits, preferences, personal history, self-image). Temperament researchers point out that the lack of attention to surviving temperament research by the creators of the Big Five model led to an overlap between its dimensions and dimensions described in multiple temperament models much earlier. For example, neuroticism reflects the traditional temperament dimension of emotionality studied by Jerome Kagan&#x27;s group since the &#x27;60s. Extraversion was also first introduced as a temperament type by Jung from the &#x27;20s.

===Heritability===

A 1996 behavioural genetics study of twins suggested that heritability (the degree of &quot;variation&quot; in a trait within a population that is due to genetic variation in that population) and environmental factors both influence all five factors to the same degree. Among four twin studies examined in 2003, the mean percentage for heritability was calculated for each personality and it was concluded that heritability influenced the five factors broadly. The self-report measures were as follows: openness to experience was estimated to have a 57% genetic influence, extraversion 54%, conscientiousness 49%, neuroticism 48%, and agreeableness 42%.

===Non-humans===
The Big Five personality traits have been assessed in some non-human species but methodology is debatable. In one series of studies, human ratings of chimpanzees using the Hominoid Personality Questionnaire, revealed factors of extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness– as well as an additional factor of dominance–across hundreds of chimpanzees in zoological parks, a large naturalistic sanctuary, and a research laboratory. Neuroticism and openness factors were found in an original zoo sample, but were not replicated in a new zoo sample or in other settings (perhaps reflecting the design of the CPQ). A study review found that markers for the three dimensions extraversion, neuroticism, and agreeableness were found most consistently across different species, followed by openness; only chimpanzees showed markers for conscientious behavior.

A study completed in 2020 concluded that dolphins have some similar personality traits to humans. Both are large brained intelligent animals but have evolved separately for millions of years.

===Development during childhood and adolescence===

Research on the Big Five, and personality in general, has focused primarily on individual differences in adulthood, rather than in childhood and adolescence, and often include temperament traits. Recently, there has been growing recognition of the need to study child and adolescent personality trait development in order to understand how traits develop and change throughout the lifespan.

Recent studies have begun to explore the developmental origins and trajectories of the Big Five among children and adolescents, especially those that relate to temperament. Many researchers have sought to distinguish between personality and temperament. Temperament often refers to early behavioral and affective characteristics that are thought to be driven primarily by genes. Models of temperament often include four trait dimensions: surgency/sociability, negative emotionality, persistence/effortful control, and activity level. Some of these differences in temperament are evident at, if not before, birth. For example, both parents and researchers recognize that some newborn infants are peaceful and easily soothed while others are comparatively fussy and hard to calm. Unlike temperament, however, many researchers view the development of personality as gradually occurring throughout childhood. Contrary to some researchers who question whether children have stable personality traits, Big Five or otherwise, most researchers contend that there are significant psychological differences between children that are associated with relatively stable, distinct, and salient behavior patterns.

The structure, manifestations, and development of the Big Five in childhood and adolescence have been studied using a variety of methods, including parent- and teacher-ratings, preadolescent and adolescent self- and peer-ratings, and observations of parent-child interactions. Results from these studies support the relative stability of personality traits across the human lifespan, at least from preschool age through adulthood. More specifically, research suggests that four of the Big Five – namely Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness – reliably describe personality differences in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. However, some evidence suggests that Openness may not be a fundamental, stable part of childhood personality. Although some researchers have found that Openness in children and adolescents relates to attributes such as creativity, curiosity, imagination, and intellect, many researchers have failed to find distinct individual differences in Openness in childhood and early adolescence. Potentially, Openness may (a) manifest in unique, currently unknown ways in childhood or (b) may only manifest as children develop socially and cognitively. Other studies have found evidence for all of the Big Five traits in childhood and adolescence as well as two other child-specific traits: Irritability and Activity. Despite these specific differences, the majority of findings suggest that personality traits – particularly Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness – are evident in childhood and adolescence and are associated with distinct social-emotional patterns of behavior that are largely consistent with adult manifestations of those same personality traits. Some researchers have proposed the youth personality trait is best described by six trait dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and activity. Despite some preliminary evidence for this &quot;Little Six&quot; model, research in this area has been delayed by a lack of available measures.

Previous research has found evidence that most adults become more agreeable and conscientious and less neurotic as they age. This has been referred to as the maturation effect. Many researchers have sought to investigate how trends in adult personality development compare to trends in youth personality development. Two main population-level indices have been important in this area of research: rank-order consistency and mean-level consistency. Rank-order consistency indicates the relative placement of individuals within a group. Mean-level consistency indicates whether groups increase or decrease on certain traits throughout the lifetime.

Findings from these studies indicate that, consistent with adult personality trends, youth personality becomes increasingly more stable in terms of rank-order throughout childhood. Unlike adult personality research, which indicates that people become agreeable, conscientious, and emotionally stable with age, some findings in youth personality research have indicated that mean levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience decline from late childhood to late adolescence. The disruption hypothesis, which proposes that biological, social, and psychological changes experienced during youth result in temporary dips in maturity, has been proposed to explain these findings.

====Extraversion/positive emotionality====

In Big Five studies, extraversion has been associated with surgency. Children with high Extraversion are energetic, talkative, social, and dominant with children and adults, whereas children with low extraversion tend to be quiet, calm, inhibited, and submissive to other children and adults. Individual differences in extraversion first manifest in infancy as varying levels of positive emotionality. These differences in turn predict social and physical activity during later childhood and may represent, or be associated with, the behavioral activation system. In children, Extraversion/Positive Emotionality includes four sub-traits: three of these (&quot;activity&quot;, &quot;sociability&quot;, and &quot;shyness&quot;) are similar to the previously described traits of temperament; the other is &quot;dominance&quot;.

*Activity: Similarly to findings in temperament research, children with high activity tend to have high energy levels and more intense and frequent motor activity compared to their peers. Salient differences in activity reliably manifest in infancy, persist through adolescence, and fade as motor activity decreases in adulthood or potentially develops into talkativeness.
*Dominance: Children with high dominance tend to influence the behavior of others, particularly their peers, to obtain desirable rewards or outcomes. Such children are generally skilled at organizing activities and games and deceiving others by controlling their nonverbal behavior.
*Shyness: Children with high shyness are generally socially withdrawn, nervous, and inhibited around strangers. In time, such children may become fearful even around &quot;known others&quot;, especially if their peers reject them. Similar pattern was described in temperament longitudinal studies of shyness
*Sociability: Children with high sociability generally prefer to be with others rather than alone. During middle childhood, the distinction between low sociability and high shyness becomes more pronounced, particularly as children gain greater control over how and where they spend their time.

===Development throughout adulthood===
Many studies of longitudinal data, which correlate people&#x27;s test scores over time, and cross-sectional data, which compare personality levels across different age groups, show a high degree of stability in personality traits during adulthood, especially Neuroticism that is often regarded as a temperament trait similarly to longitudinal research in temperament for the same traits. It is shown that the personality stabilizes for working-age individuals within about four years after starting working. There is also little evidence that adverse life events can have any significant impact on the personality of individuals. More recent research and meta-analyses of previous studies, however, indicate that change occurs in all five traits at various points in the lifespan. The new research shows evidence for a maturation effect. On average, levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness typically increase with time, whereas extraversion, neuroticism, and openness tend to decrease. Research has also demonstrated that changes in Big Five personality traits depend on the individual&#x27;s current stage of development. For example, levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness demonstrate a negative trend during childhood and early adolescence before trending upwards during late adolescence and into adulthood. In addition to these group effects, there are individual differences: different people demonstrate unique patterns of change at all stages of life.

In addition, some research (Fleeson, 2001) suggests that the Big Five should not be conceived of as dichotomies (such as extraversion vs. introversion) but as continua. Each individual has the capacity to move along each dimension as circumstances (social or temporal) change. Someone is therefore not simply on one end of each trait dichotomy but is a blend of both, exhibiting some characteristics more often than others:

Research regarding personality with growing age has suggested that as individuals enter their elder years (79–86), those with lower IQ see a raise in extraversion, but a decline in conscientiousness and physical well-being.

==Group differences==

===Gender differences===
Some cross-cultural research has shown some patterns of gender differences on responses to the NEO-PI-R and the Big Five Inventory. For example, women consistently report higher Neuroticism, Agreeableness, warmth (an extraversion facet) and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness (a facet of extraversion) and openness to ideas as assessed by the NEO-PI-R.

A study of gender differences in 55 nations using the Big Five Inventory found that women tended to be somewhat higher than men in neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The difference in neuroticism was the most prominent and consistent, with significant differences found in 49 of the 55 nations surveyed.

Gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous, healthy, and more gender-egalitarian nations. The explanation for this, as stated by the researchers of a 2001 paper, is that actions by women in individualistic, egalitarian countries are more likely to be attributed to their personality, rather than being attributed to ascribed gender roles within collectivist, traditional countries.

Measured differences in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were caused by the changes in the measured personalities of men, not women, in these respective regions. That is, men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic, less extraverted, less conscientious and less agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions. Women, on the other hand tended not to differ in personality traits across regions.

===Birth-order differences===

Frank Sulloway argues that firstborns are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to siblings that were born later. Large-scale studies using random samples and self-report personality tests, however, have found milder effects than Sulloway claimed, or no significant effects of birth order on personality. A study using the Project Talent data, which is a large-scale representative survey of American high school students, with 272,003 eligible participants, found statistically significant but very small effects (the average absolute correlation between birth order and personality was .02) of birth order on personality, such that firstborns were slightly more conscientious, dominant, and agreeable, while also being less neurotic and less sociable. Parental socioeconomic status and participant gender had much larger correlations with personality.

In 2002, the Journal of Psychology posted a Big Five Personality Trait Difference; where researchers explored the relationship between the five-factor model and the Universal-Diverse Orientation (UDO) in counselor trainees. (Thompson, R., Brossart, D., and Mivielle, A., 2002). UDO is known as one social attitude that produces a strong awareness and/or acceptance towards the similarities and differences among individuals. (Miville, M., Romas, J., Johnson, J., and Lon, R. 2002) The study found that the counselor trainees that are more open to the idea of creative expression (a facet of Openness to Experience, Openness to Aesthetics) among individuals are more likely to work with a diverse group of clients, and feel comfortable in their role.

==Cultural differences==

Individual differences in personality traits are widely understood to be conditioned by cultural context.

Research into the Big Five has been pursued in a variety of languages and cultures, such as German, Chinese, and South Asian. For example, Thompson has claimed to find the Big Five structure across several cultures using an international English language scale.
Cheung, van de Vijver, and Leong (2011) suggest, however, that the Openness factor is particularly unsupported in Asian countries and that a different fifth factor is identified.

Sopagna Eap et al. (2008) found that European-American men scored higher than Asian-American men on extroversion, conscientiousness, and openness, while Asian-American men scored higher than European-American men on neuroticism. Benet-Martínez and Karakitapoglu-Aygün (2003) arrived at similar results.

Recent work has found relationships between Geert Hofstede&#x27;s cultural factors, Individualism, Power Distance, Masculinity, and Uncertainty Avoidance, with the average Big Five scores in a country. For instance, the degree to which a country values individualism correlates with its average extraversion, whereas people living in cultures which are accepting of large inequalities in their power structures tend to score somewhat higher on conscientiousness.

A 2017 study has found that countries&#x27; average personality trait levels are correlated with their political systems. Countries with higher average trait Openness tended to have more democratic institutions, an association that held even after factoring out other relevant influences such as economic development.

Attempts to replicate the Big Five have succeeded in some countries but not in others. Some research suggests, for instance, that Hungarians do not have a single agreeableness factor. Other researchers have found evidence for agreeableness but not for other factors.

==Health==

=== Personality and dementia ===
Some diseases cause changes in personality. For example, although gradual memory impairment is the hallmark feature of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, a systematic review of personality changes in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease by Robins Wahlin and Byrne, published in 2011, found systematic and consistent trait changes mapped to the Big Five. The largest change observed was a decrease in conscientiousness. The next most significant changes were an increase in Neuroticism and decrease in Extraversion, but Openness and Agreeableness were also decreased. These changes in personality could assist with early diagnosis.

A study published in 2023 found that the Big Five personality traits may also influence the quality of life experienced by people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other dementias, post diagnosis. In this study people with dementia with lower levels of Neuroticism self-reported higher quality of life than those with higher levels of Neuroticism while those with higher levels of the other four traits self-reported higher quality of life than those with lower levels of these traits. This suggests that as well as assisting with early diagnosis, the Big Five personality traits could help identify people with dementia potentially more vulnerable to adverse outcomes and inform personalized care planning and interventions.

=== Personality disorders ===

, there were over fifty published studies relating the FFM to personality disorders. Since that time, quite a number of additional studies have expanded on this research base and provided further empirical support for understanding the DSM personality disorders in terms of the FFM domains.

In her review of the personality disorder literature published in 2007, Lee Anna Clark asserted that &quot;the five-factor model of personality is widely accepted as representing the higher-order structure of both normal and abnormal personality traits&quot;. However, other researchers disagree that this model is widely accepted (see the section Critique below) and suggest that it simply replicates early temperament research. Noticeably, FFM publications never compare their findings to temperament models even though temperament and mental disorders (especially personality disorders) are thought to be based on the same neurotransmitter imbalances, just to varying degrees.

The five-factor model was claimed to significantly predict all ten personality disorder symptoms and outperform the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in the prediction of borderline, avoidant, and dependent personality disorder symptoms. However, most predictions related to an increase in Neuroticism and a decrease in Agreeableness, and therefore did not differentiate between the disorders very well.

===Common mental disorders===
Converging evidence from several nationally representative studies has established three classes of mental disorders which are especially common in the general population: Depressive disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymic disorder), anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, and social phobia), and substance use disorders (SUDs). The Five Factor personality profiles of users of different drugs may be different. For example, the typical profile for heroin users is formula_1, whereas for ecstasy users the high level of N is not expected but E is higher: formula_2.

These common mental disorders (CMDs) have been empirically linked to the Big Five personality traits, neuroticism in particular. Numerous studies have found that having high scores of neuroticism significantly increases one&#x27;s risk for developing a common mental disorder. A large-scale meta-analysis (n &gt; 75,000) examining the relationship between all of the Big Five personality traits and common mental disorders found that low conscientiousness yielded consistently strong effects for each common mental disorder examined (i.e., MDD, dysthymic disorder, GAD, PTSD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, and SUD). This finding parallels research on physical health, which has established that conscientiousness is the strongest personality predictor of reduced mortality, and is highly negatively correlated with making poor health choices. In regards to the other personality domains, the meta-analysis found that all common mental disorders examined were defined by high neuroticism, most exhibited low extraversion, only SUD was linked to agreeableness (negatively), and no disorders were associated with Openness. A meta-analysis of 59 longitudinal studies showed that high neuroticism predicted the development of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, psychosis, schizophrenia, and non-specific mental distress, also after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history.

====The personality-psychopathology models====

Five major models have been posed to explain the nature of the relationship between personality and mental illness. There is currently no single &quot;best model&quot;, as each of them has received at least some empirical support. These models are not mutually exclusive – more than one may be operating for a particular individual and various mental disorders may be explained by different models.
* The Vulnerability/Risk Model: According to this model, personality contributes to the onset or etiology of various common mental disorders. In other words, pre-existing personality traits either cause the development of CMDs directly or enhance the impact of causal risk factors. There is strong support for neuroticism being a robust vulnerability factor.
* The Pathoplasty Model: This model proposes that premorbid personality traits impact the expression, course, severity, and/or treatment response of a mental disorder. An example of this relationship would be a heightened likelihood of committing suicide in a depressed individual who also has low levels of constraint.
* The Common Cause Model: According to the common cause model, personality traits are predictive of CMDs because personality and psychopathology have shared genetic and environmental determinants which result in non-causal associations between the two constructs.
* The Spectrum Model: This model proposes that associations between personality and psychopathology are found because these two constructs both occupy a single domain or spectrum and psychopathology is simply a display of the extremes of normal personality function. Support for this model is provided by an issue of criterion overlap. For instance, two of the primary facet scales of neuroticism in the NEO-PI-R are &quot;depression&quot; and &quot;anxiety&quot;. Thus the fact that diagnostic criteria for depression, anxiety, and neuroticism assess the same content increases the correlations between these domains.
* The Scar Model: According to the scar model, episodes of a mental disorder &#x27;scar&#x27; an individual&#x27;s personality, changing it in significant ways from premorbid functioning. An example of a scar effect would be a decrease in openness to experience following an episode of PTSD.

===Physical health===
To examine how the Big Five personality traits are related to subjective health outcomes (positive and negative mood, physical symptoms, and general health concern) and objective health conditions (chronic illness, serious illness, and physical injuries), Jasna Hudek-Knezevic and Igor Kardum conducted a study from a sample of 822 healthy volunteers (438 women and 384 men). Out of the Big Five personality traits, they found neuroticism most related to worse subjective health outcomes and optimistic control to better subjective health outcomes. When relating to objective health conditions, connections drawn were presented weak, except that neuroticism significantly predicted chronic illness, whereas optimistic control was more closely related to physical injuries caused by accident.

Being highly conscientious may add as much as five years to one&#x27;s life. The Big Five personality traits also predict positive health outcomes. In an elderly Japanese sample, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness were related to lower risk of mortality.

Higher conscientiousness is associated with lower obesity risk. In already obese individuals, higher conscientiousness is associated with a higher likelihood of becoming non-obese over a five-year period.

== Effect of personality traits through life ==

===Education===

====Academic achievement====

Personality plays an important role in academic achievement. A study of 308 undergraduates who completed the Five Factor Inventory Processes and reported their GPA suggested that conscientiousness and agreeableness have a positive relationship with all types of learning styles (synthesis-analysis, methodical study, fact retention, and elaborative processing), whereas neuroticism shows an inverse relationship. Moreover, extraversion and openness were proportional to elaborative processing. The Big Five personality traits accounted for 14% of the variance in GPA, suggesting that personality traits make some contributions to academic performance. Furthermore, reflective learning styles (synthesis-analysis and elaborative processing) were able to mediate the relationship between openness and GPA. These results indicate that intellectual curiosity significantly enhances academic performance if students combine their scholarly interest with thoughtful information processing.

A recent study of Israeli high-school students found that those in the gifted program systematically scored higher on openness and lower on neuroticism than those not in the gifted program. While not a measure of the Big Five, gifted students also reported less state anxiety than students not in the gifted program. Specific Big Five personality traits predict learning styles in addition to academic success.

*GPA and exam performance are both predicted by conscientiousness
*neuroticism is negatively related to academic success
*openness predicts utilizing synthesis-analysis and elaborative-processing learning styles
*neuroticism negatively correlates with learning styles in general
*openness and extraversion both predict all four learning styles.

Studies conducted on college students have concluded that hope, which is linked to agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness, has a positive effect on psychological well-being. Individuals high in neurotic tendencies are less likely to display hopeful tendencies and are negatively associated with well-being. Personality can sometimes be flexible and measuring the big five personality for individuals as they enter certain stages of life may predict their educational identity. Recent studies have suggested the likelihood of an individual&#x27;s personality affecting their educational identity.

====Learning styles====
Learning styles have been described as &quot;enduring ways of thinking and processing information&quot;.

In 2008, the Association for Psychological Science (APS) commissioned a report that concludes that no significant evidence exists that learning-style assessments should be included in the education system. Thus it is premature, at best, to conclude that the evidence links the Big Five to &quot;learning styles&quot;, or &quot;learning styles&quot; to learning itself.

However, the APS report also suggested that all existing learning styles have not been exhausted and that there could exist learning styles worthy of being included in educational practices. There are studies that conclude that personality and thinking styles may be intertwined in ways that link thinking styles to the Big Five personality traits. There is no general consensus on the number or specifications of particular learning styles, but there have been many different proposals.

As one example, Schmeck, Ribich, and Ramanaiah (1997) defined four types of learning styles:

*synthesis analysis
*methodical study
*fact retention
*elaborative processing

When all four facets are implicated within the classroom, they will each likely improve academic achievement. By identifying learning strategies in individuals, learning and academic achievement can be improved, and a deeper understanding of information processing can be gained. This model asserts that students develop either agentic/shallow processing or reflective/deep processing. Deep processors are more often found to be more conscientious, intellectually open, and extraverted than shallow processors. Deep processing is associated with appropriate study methods (methodical study) and a stronger ability to analyze information (synthesis analysis), whereas shallow processors prefer structured fact retention learning styles and are better suited for elaborative processing. The main functions of these four specific learning styles are as follows:

Openness has been linked to learning styles that often lead to academic success and higher grades like synthesis analysis and methodical study. Because conscientiousness and openness have been shown to predict all four learning styles, it suggests that individuals who possess characteristics like discipline, determination, and curiosity are more likely to engage in all of the above learning styles.

According to the research carried out by Komarraju, Karau, Schmeck &amp; Avdic (2011), conscientiousness and agreeableness are positively related with all four learning styles, whereas neuroticism was negatively related with those four. Furthermore, extraversion and openness were only positively related to elaborative processing, and openness itself correlated with higher academic achievement.

In addition, a previous study by psychologist Mikael Jensen has shown relationships between the Big Five personality traits, learning, and academic achievement. According to Jensen, all personality traits, except neuroticism, are associated with learning goals and motivation. Openness and conscientiousness influence individuals to learn to a high degree unrecognized, while extraversion and agreeableness have similar effects. Conscientiousness and neuroticism also influence individuals to perform well in front of others for a sense of credit and reward, while agreeableness forces individuals to avoid this strategy of learning. Jensen&#x27;s study concludes that individuals who score high on the agreeableness trait will likely learn just to perform well in front of others.

Besides openness, all Big Five personality traits helped predict the educational identity of students. Based on these findings, scientists are beginning to see that the Big Five traits might have a large influence of on academic motivation that leads to predicting a student&#x27;s academic performance.

Some authors suggested that Big Five personality traits combined with learning styles can help predict some variations in the academic performance and the academic motivation of an individual which can then influence their academic achievements. This may be seen because individual differences in personality represent stable approaches to information processing. For instance, conscientiousness has consistently emerged as a stable predictor of success in exam performance, largely because conscientious students experience fewer study delays. Conscientiousness shows a positive association with the four learning styles because students with high levels of conscientiousness develop focused learning strategies and appear to be more disciplined and achievement-oriented.

====Distance Learning====
When the relationship between the five-factor personality traits and academic achievement in distance education settings was examined in brief, the openness personality trait was found to be the most important variable that has a positive relationship with academic achievement in distance education environments. In addition, it was found that self-discipline, extraversion, and adaptability personality traits are generally in a positive relationship with academic achievement. The most important personality trait that has a negative relationship with academic achievement has emerged as neuroticism. The results generally show that individuals who are organized, planned, determined, who are oriented to new ideas and independent thinking have increased success in distance education environments. On the other hand, it can be said that individuals with anxiety and stress tendencies generally have lower academic success.

===Employment===
====Occupation and personality fit====
Researchers have long suggested that work is more likely to be fulfilling to the individual and beneficial to society when there is alignment between the person and their occupation. For instance, software programmers and scientists often rank high on Openness to experience and tend to be intellectually curious, think in symbols and abstractions, and find repetition boring. Psychologists and sociologists rank higher on Agreeableness and Openness than economists and jurists.

====Work success====

It is believed that the Big Five traits are predictors of future performance outcomes to varying degrees. Specific facets of the Big Five traits are also thought to be indicators of success in the workplace, and each individual facet can give a more precise indication as to the nature of a person. Different traits&#x27; facets are needed for different occupations. Various facets of the Big Five traits can predict the success of people in different environments. The estimated levels of an individual&#x27;s success in jobs that require public speaking versus one-on-one interactions will differ according to whether that person has particular traits&#x27; facets.

Job outcome measures include job and training proficiency and personnel data. However, research demonstrating such prediction has been criticized, in part because of the apparently low correlation coefficients characterizing the relationship between personality and job performance. In a 2007 article states: &quot;The problem with personality tests is ... that the validity of personality measures as predictors of job performance is often disappointingly low. The argument for using personality tests to predict performance does not strike me as convincing in the first place.&quot;

Such criticisms were put forward by Walter Mischel, whose publication caused a two-decades&#x27; long crisis in personality psychometrics. However, later work demonstrated that the correlations obtained by psychometric personality researchers were actually very respectable by comparative standards, and that the economic value of even incremental increases in prediction accuracy was exceptionally large, given the vast difference in performance by those who occupy complex job positions.

Research has suggested that individuals who are considered leaders typically exhibit lower amounts of neurotic traits, maintain higher levels of openness, balanced levels of conscientiousness, and balanced levels of extraversion. Further studies have linked professional burnout to neuroticism, and extraversion to enduring positive work experience. Studies have linked national innovation, leadership, and ideation to openness to experience and conscientiousness. Occupational self-efficacy has also been shown to be positively correlated with conscientiousness and negatively correlated with neuroticism. Some research has also suggested that the conscientiousness of a supervisor is positively associated with an employee&#x27;s perception of abusive supervision. Others have suggested that low agreeableness and high neuroticism are traits more related to abusive supervision.

Openness is positively related to proactivity at the individual and the organizational levels and is negatively related to team and organizational proficiency. These effects were found to be completely independent of one another. This is also counter-conscientious and has a negative correlation to Conscientiousness.

Agreeableness is negatively related to individual task proactivity. Typically this is associated with lower career success and being less able to cope with conflict. However there are benefits to the Agreeableness personality trait including higher subjective well-being; more positive interpersonal interactions and helping behavior; lower conflict; lower deviance and turnover. Furthermore, attributes related to Agreeableness are important for workforce readiness for a variety of occupations and performance criteria. Research has suggested that those who are high in agreeableness are not as successful in accumulating income.

Extraversion results in greater leadership emergence and effectiveness; as well as higher job and life satisfaction. However extraversion can lead to more impulsive behaviors, more accidents and lower performance in certain jobs.

Conscientiousness is highly predictive of job performance in general, and is positively related to all forms of work role performance, including job performance and job satisfaction, greater leadership effectiveness, lower turnover and deviant behaviors. However this personality trait is associated with reduced adaptability, lower learning in initial stages of skill acquisition and more interpersonally abrasiveness, when also low in agreeableness. It is also not the case that more or extreme conscientiousness is always necessarily better as there does appear to be a link between conscientiousness and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). Selecting employees for a moderate level of conscientiousness may actually provide the best occupational outcome.

Neuroticism is negatively related to all forms of work role performance. This increases the chance of engaging in risky behaviors.

Two theories have been integrated in an attempt to account for these differences in work role performance. Trait activation theory posits that within a person trait levels predict future behavior, that trait levels differ between people, and that work-related cues activate traits which leads to work relevant behaviors. Role theory suggests that role senders provide cues to elicit desired behaviors. In this context, role senders provide workers with cues for expected behaviors, which in turn activates personality traits and work relevant behaviors. In essence, expectations of the role sender lead to different behavioral outcomes depending on the trait levels of individual workers, and because people differ in trait levels, responses to these cues will not be universal.

=== Romantic relationships ===

The Big Five model of personality was used for attempts to predict satisfaction in romantic relationships, relationship quality in dating, engaged, and married couples.

=== Political identification ===

The Big Five Personality Model also has applications in the study of political psychology. Studies have been finding links between the big five personality traits and political identification. It has been found by several studies that individuals who score high in Conscientiousness are more likely to possess a right-wing political identification. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a strong correlation was identified between high scores in Openness to Experience and a left-leaning ideology. While the traits of agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism have not been consistently linked to either conservative or liberal ideology, with studies producing mixed results, such traits are promising when analyzing the strength of an individual&#x27;s party identification. However, correlations between the Big Five and political beliefs, while present, tend to be small, with one study finding correlations ranged from 0.14 to 0.24.

=== Scope of predictive power ===

The predictive effects of the Big Five personality traits relate mostly to social functioning and rules-driven behavior and are not very specific for prediction of particular aspects of behavior. For example, it was noted by all temperament researchers that high neuroticism precedes the development of all common mental disorders and is not associated with personality. Further evidence is required to fully uncover the nature and differences between personality traits, temperament and life outcomes. Social and contextual parameters also play a role in outcomes and the interaction between the two is not yet fully understood.

=== Religiosity ===

Though the effect sizes are small: Of the Big Five personality traits high Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Extraversion relate to general religiosity, while Openness relate negatively to religious fundamentalism and positively to spirituality. High Neuroticism may be related to extrinsic religiosity, whereas intrinsic religiosity and spirituality reflect Emotional Stability.

==Measurements==

Several measures of the Big Five exist:

* International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)
* NEO-PI-R
* The Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and the Five Item Personality Inventory (FIPI) are very abbreviated rating forms of the Big Five personality traits.
* Self-descriptive sentence questionnaires
* Lexical questionnaires
* Self-report questionnaires
* Relative-scored Big 5 measure

The most frequently used measures of the Big Five comprise either items that are self-descriptive sentences or, in the case of lexical measures, items that are single adjectives. Due to the length of sentence-based and some lexical measures, short forms have been developed and validated for use in applied research settings where questionnaire space and respondent time are limited, such as the 40-item balanced &quot;International English Big-Five Mini-Markers&quot; or a very brief (10 item) measure of the Big Five domains. Research has suggested that some methodologies in administering personality tests are inadequate in length and provide insufficient detail to truly evaluate personality. Usually, longer, more detailed questions will give a more accurate portrayal of personality. At the same time, shorter questionnaires may be sufficient to get a reasonable estimate of Big Five personality scores when questions are carefully selected and statistical imputation is used. The five factor structure has been replicated in peer reports. However, many of the substantive findings rely on self-reports. 

Much of the evidence on the measures of the Big 5 relies on self-report questionnaires, which makes self-report bias and falsification of responses difficult to deal with and account for. It has been argued that the Big Five tests do not create an accurate personality profile because the responses given on these tests are not true in all cases and can be falsified. For example, questionnaires are answered by potential employees who might choose answers that paint them in the best light.

Research suggests that a relative-scored Big Five measure in which respondents had to make repeated choices between equally desirable personality descriptors may be a potential alternative to traditional Big Five measures in accurately assessing personality traits, especially when lying or biased responding is present. When compared with a traditional Big Five measure for its ability to predict GPA and creative achievement under both normal and &quot;fake good&quot;-bias response conditions, the relative-scored measure significantly and consistently predicted these outcomes under both conditions; however, the Likert questionnaire lost its predictive ability in the faking condition. Thus, the relative-scored measure proved to be less affected by biased responding than the Likert measure of the Big Five.

Andrew H. Schwartz analyzed 700 million words, phrases, and topic instances collected from the Facebook messages of 75,000 volunteers, who also took standard personality tests, and found striking variations in language with personality, gender, and age.

==Critique==
The proposed Big Five model has been subjected to considerable critical scrutiny in a number of published studies. One prominent critic of the model has been Jack Block at the University of California, Berkeley. In response to Block, the model was defended in a paper published by Costa and McCrae. This was followed by a number of published critical replies from Block.

It has been argued that there are limitations to the scope of the Big Five model as an explanatory or predictive theory. It has also been argued that measures of the Big Five account for only 56% of the normal personality trait sphere alone (not even considering the abnormal personality trait sphere). Also, the static Big Five is not theory driven, it is merely a statistically driven investigation of certain descriptors that tend to cluster together often based on less-than-optimal factor analytic procedures. Measures of the Big Five constructs appear to show some consistency in interviews, self-descriptions and observations, and this static five-factor structure seems to be found across a wide range of participants of different ages and cultures. However, while genotypic temperament trait dimensions might appear across different cultures, the phenotypic expression of personality traits differs profoundly across different cultures as a function of the different socio-cultural conditioning and experiential learning that takes place within different cultural settings.

Moreover, the fact that the Big Five model was based on lexical hypothesis (i.e. on the verbal descriptors of individual differences) indicated strong methodological flaws in this model, especially related to its main factors, Extraversion and Neuroticism. First, there is a natural pro-social bias of language in people&#x27;s verbal evaluations. After all, language is an invention of group dynamics that was developed to facilitate socialization and the exchange of information and to synchronize group activity. This social function of language therefore creates a sociability bias in verbal descriptors of human behavior: there are more words related to social than physical or even mental aspects of behavior. The sheer number of such descriptors will cause them to group into the largest factor in any language, and such grouping has nothing to do with the way that core systems of individual differences are set up. Second, there is also a negativity bias in emotionality (i.e. most emotions have negative affectivity), and there are more words in language to describe negative rather than positive emotions. Such asymmetry in emotional valence creates another bias in language. Experiments using the lexical hypothesis approach indeed demonstrated that the use of lexical material skews the resulting dimensionality according to a sociability bias of language and a negativity bias of emotionality, grouping all evaluations around these two dimensions. This means that the two largest dimensions in the Big Five model might be just an artifact of the lexical approach that this model employed.

===Limited scope===
One common criticism is that the Big Five does not explain all of human personality. Some psychologists have dissented from the model precisely because they feel it neglects other domains of personality, such as religiosity, manipulativeness/machiavellianism, honesty, sexiness/seductiveness, thriftiness, , masculinity/femininity, snobbishness/egotism, sense of humour, and risk-taking/thrill-seeking. Dan P. McAdams has called the Big Five a &quot;psychology of the stranger&quot;, because they refer to traits that are relatively easy to observe in a stranger; other aspects of personality that are more privately held or more context-dependent are excluded from the Big Five. Block has pointed to several less-recognized but successful efforts to specify aspects of character not subsumed by the model.

There may be debate as to what counts as personality and what does not and the nature of the questions in the survey greatly influence outcome. Multiple particularly broad question databases have failed to produce the Big Five as the top five traits.

In many studies, the five factors are not fully orthogonal to one another; that is, the five factors are not independent. Orthogonality is viewed as desirable by some researchers because it minimizes redundancy between the dimensions. This is particularly important when the goal of a study is to provide a comprehensive description of personality with as few variables as possible.

The model is inappropriate for studying early childhood, as language is not yet developed.

===Methodological issues===
Factor analysis, the statistical method used to identify the dimensional structure of observed variables, lacks a universally recognized basis for choosing among solutions with different numbers of factors. A five factor solution depends on some degree of interpretation by the analyst. A larger number of factors may underlie these five factors. This has led to disputes about the &quot;true&quot; number of factors. Big Five proponents have responded that although other solutions may be viable in a single data set, only the five-factor structure consistently replicates across different studies. Block argues that the use of factor analysis as the exclusive paradigm for conceptualizing personality is too limited.

Surveys in studies are often online surveys of college students (compare WEIRD bias). Results do not always replicate when run on other populations or in other languages. It is not clear that different surveys measure the same 5 factors.

Moreover, the factor analysis that this model is based on is a linear method incapable of capturing nonlinear, feedback and contingent relationships between core systems of individual differences.

<doc id="1284667" wikidata="Q5252942" url="?curid=1284667" title="Del Monte Kenya">
<text>Del Monte Kenya Limited is a Kenyan food processing company that operates in the cultivation, production, and canning of pineapple products. The company produces canned solid pineapple, juice concentrates, mill juice sugar and cattle feed. Kenya&#x27;s largest single manufactured export is canned pineapple, and the country ranks among the top five pineapple exporters in the world, both of which feats are direct results of the company&#x27;s existence and operations. In the past, the company received negative publicity stemming from conflicts with workers and human rights groups, and the company has been targeted by human rights groups for hazardous conditions at the facility, poor living and working conditions for workers and for intimidating trade union groups. In 2001, the company took significant steps to address and correct matters per these concerns.

==History==
The company was previously known as Kenya Canners, which formed in 1948. Del Monte Kenya was later renamed &quot;Del Monte Royal&quot; after control was acquired by two South African families who each owned a 30% share of the company. The remaining 40% was owned by many small shareholders. This occurred after the sale of the US company Del Monte Corporation in 1965. In 2002, Cirio Alimentare acquired a 98% stake in the company, and following this the company changed its name to Cirio Del Monte Kenya Limited. The company was certified under the International Organization for Standardization SA8000 in 2002, and was recertified in March 2006. Del Monte Kenya also acquired the International Organization for Standardization 9002 certificate.

==Overview==
Cirio Del Monte Kenya owns a 10,000-acre (40 km2) pineapple plantation and employs approximately 6,000 workers (2006 estimate). Approximately 60% of the workforce is female (2004 estimate). The company employs three types of employees: permanent staff, seasonal workers and casual laborers. Permanent staff receive sick pay, holidays, rental assistance, severance pay and have a contract. Seasonal workers earn less and do not receive severance pay, although they also have a contract. Casual labourers receive no benefits and are not covered by a contract. All compensation is aligned with Kenya&#x27;s governmental laws that mandate a minimum wage of approximately KSh.2,800/= a month (2004 figures). The company&#x27;s pineapple plantations are patrolled by security guards on horseback that utilise dogs, or in Jeeps.

==Production==
In 2011 the company&#x27;s annual revenue was estimated at KSh.4.5 billion/= and its processing capacity was 1,500 tons of pineapples daily. Due to the company&#x27;s existence and operations, the largest single manufactured export from Kenya is canned pineapple. Additionally, Kenya ranks among the top five pineapple exporters in the world due to the presence and operations of Cirio Del Monte Kenya. Their products are primarily exported to the European market. 34% of the company&#x27;s production is juice concentrate, 22% is solid pineapple, 21% is mill juice sugar and 22% is cattle feed.

==Controversy==
The company experienced labour disputes that generated negative publicity and had received the attention of human rights groups. A report in 1999 by Société Générale de Surveillance concluded that Del Monte did not allow workers freedom to join trade unions, and union workers were not allowed to communicate with employees. The report also found that the company routinely threatened shop stewards with termination. Additional findings were that Del Monte did not have a safety plan in the event of an emergency, did not make first aid kits available to employees, did not provide ear protection to workers in high decibel environments and did not provide gas masks to employees using chemical sprays.

In 1999, Centro Nuovo Modello di Sviluppo (CNMS), an Italian human rights group, began a campaign for consumers in Italy to boycott Del Monte pineapples after research conducted by the group found conditions at the company&#x27;s factory to be inferior. This campaign was backed by the Kenya Human Rights Commission, which stated that wages were not enough to meet basic needs, that living quarters and sanitation was &quot;disgraceful,&quot; toxic pesticides deemed by the World Health Organization as &quot;Extremely hazardous&quot; and &quot;Highly hazardous&quot; were being used, and that the company was intimidating internal trade union leaders, among other concerns. In the past, Del Monte Royal had asserted that no evidence had been existent to corroborate CNMS&#x27; claims of any illness, disease of fatalities resulting from unsafe conditions.

On 5 October 2000, the company was asked by the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) to cease intimidation of trade unionists with Del Monte Kenya. KHRC also requested that Del Monte Kenya address matters regarding worker protection from chemicals, housing concerns and environmental pollution.

In the book &quot;Responsibility in World Business: Managing Harmful Side-Effects of Corporate Activity&quot;, published in 2004, it was stated that &quot;the hue and cry over human rights violations that rocked Del Monte Kenya is now over.&quot;

The company has been at the center of an ongoing tussle with the local community in a land ownership row with the local community whose members claim the company&#x27;s land as their rightful ancestral home.

In June 2023, British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that multiple killings occurred at Del Monte&#x27;s pineapple farm in Kenya, where security guards allegedly murdered trespassers and showed general violence against locals. Multiple alleged thieves were beaten to death by the guards, and at least one of the thieves was found with his throat cut. Locals claim serious human rights violations and are seeking for compensation from the company. In response, Del Monte&#x27;s customers, such as Tesco of the UK, suspended their orders of pineapples pending Del Monte&#x27;s internal investigation of the matter.

===Company responses===
In July 2001, the company signed an agreement to support the campaign for worker rights, and shop stewards stated that positive changes were occurring. Additionally, in December 2001, the company started a tree-planting campaign in its neighborhood as part of a pledge to promote sustainable land use and environmental protection.

==Legal matters==
On 22 October 2004, the company was ordered by a Kenyan court to compensate three of its prior employees who were exposed to toxic emissions there with almost KSh.5.5 million/=.

<text>Out of Your Mouth was a Canadian rock band from Calgary, Alberta. It was fronted by guitarist, vocalist, producer, and writer Jason Darr. The band is best known for their cover of Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Music&quot;.

== History ==
Darr, a singer-songwriter, brought together a group of local Calgary musicians under the name Flu in 1997. The band played together for several years, including in Toronto during Music Week in 2001. They participated in the Cure&#x27;s Greatest Hits tour and won a songwriting contest. Musicians included Darr, Brent Hodgins aka &quot;The Colonel&quot;, Mark Radloff and Paul Sperman. An album, &quot;Fish With Necks&quot;, containing mainly songs written by Darr, was self-released.

After a failed development deal with Dreamworks, Darr arranged a deal with Sony BMG. Because of trademark issues, the band changed their name to Out of Your Mouth. In 2004, Darr, with Sperman on drums and some guitar and backup vocals from Jerrod Maxwell-Lyster, began work on the album, and recorded a single which became a Canadian Top 40 hit, a rocked-up cover of Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Music&quot;. The album, &quot;Draghdad&quot;, which included the &quot;Music&quot; track, was released in 2004.

To publicize the album, Darr, with Sperman on bass, Maxwell-Lyster on guitar, and drummer Rob Shawcross went out on tour with Social Code, Bif Naked and The Salads, and later performed around Alberta with other bands.

After the tour, Paul Sperman left due to creative differences. Maxwell-Lyster and Shawcross also left over financial disagreements with Darr. Although Shawcross and Darr were still on good terms, the two parted ways and Darr formed a new band, Neurosonic. Maxwell-Lyster and Shawcross went on to form a local Calgary band called AutoBody.

<doc id="1284671" wikidata="Q2600143" url="?curid=1284671" title="Yerba Buena Gardens">
<text>Yerba Buena Gardens is the name for two blocks of public parks located between Third and Fourth, Mission and Folsom Streets in the South of Market (SoMA) neighbourhood of San Francisco, California. The first block bordered by Mission and Howard Streets was opened on October 11, 1993. The second block, between Howard and Folsom Streets, was opened in 1998, with a dedication to Martin Luther King Jr. by Mayor Willie Brown. A pedestrian bridge over Howard Street connects the two blocks, sitting on top of part of the Moscone Center convention center. The Yerba Buena Gardens were planned and built as the final centerpiece of the Yerba Buena Redevelopment Area which includes the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Yerba Buena Gardens Conservancy operates the property on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco.

Yerba Buena was the name of the town in the Mexican territory of Alta California that became the city of San Francisco, California, after it was claimed by the United States in 1846. It was itself named after the yerba buena (&quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot;) plant which used to be abundant in the area. The plant&#x27;s common name, yerba buena, is an alternate form of the Spanish &quot;hierba buena&quot; (meaning &quot;good herb&quot;).

== History ==
The idea of a conference center named the Yerba Buena Center itself first emerged in the early 1960s. At that time there was a concern about how development could occur in the downtown area. The South of Market area offered hundreds of acres of flat land at low land prices. Various corporate committees were founded to lobby for the redevelopment, which would also include high-rise office buildings, a vast parking garage, and a sports center. At the center of operations was the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency (SFRA) first headed by Joseph Alioto, who would go on to become mayor of the city in 1968. The area of the development was regarded as a blighted area of the city, even referred to by local media, local business and city officials as &#x27;skid row&#x27;. However, the developers did not figure on the persistence of the local community, the vast majority of which were aged, male, ex-industrial workers who lived alone in the many cheap hotels in the area. Together the latter formed the Tenants and Owners in Opposition to Redevelopment (TOOR). Their demand was to be rehoused in the area in low-rent housing. The case went to court where the judge, Stan Weigel, judged in favor of TOOR. Things changed with the election of a new city mayor, George Moscone, in 1976, who spearheaded construction. The Gardens was later built as part of a deal by Mayor Moscone with developers to &quot;set aside land and funds for cultural institutions such as museums, exhibits, and theaters.&quot;

==Reception==
In 1999 the Yerba Buena Gardens received the Gold Medal of the biannual Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence. In praising the design of the work, the jury noted the process that led to the creation of the gardens, as well as its inclusiveness in terms of the population it serves and its neighborhood: &quot;The mixed-use development enables cultural, social justice, and economic development agendas to coexist within a network of collaborative management practices.&quot; Furthermore, the jury &quot;applauded the evolution of the project&#x27;s development process to an inclusive model involving multiple constituencies.&quot; However, in his history of the development of San Francisco from the 1950s to the 1990s Chester Hartman recounts that the entire Yerba Buena project was long drawn out over 3 decades, born of a local struggle that included evictions and harassment of the previous tenants in the area, most of them old and poor, but who had joined to fight for their rights. Even during the final design stages there were struggles regarding the building program. After John Elberling, of the Tenants and Owners Development Corporation (TODCO) protested the removal of a bowling alley from the plans, the San Francisco Development Agency (SFRA) backed down and the bowling alley was re-included and eventually built.
==Public art==

The original block opened in 1993 contains several public art installations. One cornerstone is the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and Fountain. The King memorial, titled &quot;Revelations,&quot; consists of large, etched glass excerpts of King&#x27;s speeches in the languages of San Francisco&#x27;s sister cities. The entire memorial was a collaborative project between sculptor Houston Conwill, poet Estella Majoza and architect Joseph De Pace.

Conwill said Revelations is “a sacred space … meant to be experienced as a cultural pilgrimage and a journey of transformation.” The act of entering the fountain from the Gardens, reading of the text from North wall to East then, South Wall while beneath the water, then exiting back out into the garden, represents &#x27;a cultural pilgrimage and contemplative metaphorical journey of transformation,&#x27; parallel to the Southern tradition of baptism by full immersion in water common within Old School Baptist churches like those of King&#x27;s grandfather, legendary minister Adam Daniel Williams. On the terrace level above the waterfall is the Sister Cities Garden, where visitors can see a manicured garden with plants representing each of San Francisco&#x27;s sister cities and a view of the downtown skyline.

==Other attractions==
Located in the Gardens proper are the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, a contemporary arts center in the North block, and the Children&#x27;s Creativity Museum, a children&#x27;s museum in the South block. An ice skating rink, a bowling alley, and the LeRoy King Carousel -— a restored 1906 carousel by Charles I. D. Looff can also be found in the South block.

The Mexican Museum is (as of 2021) planned to inhabit the lower several floors of a building across Mission Street as part the 53-story 706 Mission / Four Seasons Residence tower. The project is planned to cost $500 million ($30 million of which for the museum) and will complete the &quot;Yerba Buena district&quot; redevelopment area, which apart from the Yerba Buena Gardens includes the Metreon and Moscone Center.

<text>5α-Reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), also known as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) blockers, are a class of medications with antiandrogenic effects which are used primarily in the treatment of enlarged prostate and scalp hair loss. They are also sometimes used to treat excess hair growth in women and as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women.

These agents inhibit the enzyme 5α-reductase, which is involved in the metabolic transformations of a variety of endogenous steroids. 5-ARIs are most known for preventing conversion of testosterone, the major androgen sex hormone, to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT), in certain androgen-associated disorders.

==Medical uses==
5-ARIs are clinically used in the treatment of conditions that are exacerbated by DHT:

* Mild-to-moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms
* Pattern hair loss in both men and women

5-ARIs can be used in the treatment of hirsutism in women. The usefulness of 5-ARIs for the potential treatment of acne is uncertain. 5-ARIs are sometimes used as antiandrogens in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women to help reduce body hair growth and scalp hair loss.

They have also been explored in the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer. While the 5-ARI finasteride reduces the cancer risk by about a third, it also increases the fraction of aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Overall, there does not seem to be a survival benefit for prostate cancer patients under finasteride.

===Available forms===
Finasteride (brand names Proscar, Propecia) inhibits the function of two of the isoenzymes (types 2 and 3) of 5α-reductase. It decreases circulating DHT levels by up to about 70%. Dutasteride (brand name Avodart) inhibits all three 5α-reductase isoenzymes and can decrease DHT levels by 95%. It can also reduce DHT levels in the prostate by 97 to 99% in men with prostate cancer. Epristeride (brand names Aipuliete, Chuanliu) is marketed in China for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, it can only decrease circulating DHT levels by about 25 to 54%. Alfatradiol (brand names Ell-Cranell Alpha, Pantostin) is a topical 5-ARI used to treat pattern hair loss in Europe. 

==Side effects==
5-ARIs are generally well tolerated in both men and women and produce few side effects. However, they have been found to have some risks in studies with men, including slightly increased risks of decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, infertility, breast tenderness, gynecomastia, depression, anxiety, self-harm, and dementia. In addition, although 5-ARIs decrease the overall risk of developing prostate cancer, they have been found to increase the risk of developing certain rare but high-grade forms of prostate cancer. As a result, the FDA has notified healthcare professionals that the Warnings and Precautions section of the labels for the 5-ARI class of drugs has been revised to include new safety information about the increased risk of being diagnosed with these rare but more serious forms of prostate cancer. Finasteride has also been associated with intraoperative floppy iris syndrome and cataract formation. Depressive symptoms and suicidality have been reported.

===Sexual dysfunction===
Sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, and reduced ejaculate, may occur in 3.4 to 15.8% of men treated with finasteride or dutasteride. This is linked to lower quality of life and can cause stress in relationships. There is also an association with lowered sexual desire. It has been reported that in a subset of men, these adverse sexual side effects may persist even after discontinuation of finasteride or dutasteride.

===Breast changes===
5-ARIs have a small risk of breast changes in men including breast tenderness and gynecomastia (breast development/enlargement). The risk of gynecomastia is about 1.3%. There is no association of 5-ARIs with male breast cancer.

===Emotional changes===
A 2017 population-based, matched-cohort study of 93,197 men aged 66 years and older with BPH found that finasteride and dutasteride were associated with a significantly increased risk of depression (, 1.94; 95% , 1.73–2.16) and self-harm (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.34–2.64) during the first 18 months of treatment, but were not associated with an increased risk of suicide (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53–1.45). After the initial 18 months of therapy, the risk of self-harm was no longer heightened, whereas the elevation in risk of depression lessened but remained marginally increased (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08–1.37). The absolute increase in the rate of depression was 247 per 100,000 patient-years and of self-harm was 17 per 100,000 patient-years. As such, on the basis of these findings, it has been stated that cases of depression in patients that are attributable to 5-ARIs will be encountered on occasion, while cases of self-harm attributable to 5-ARIs will be encountered very rarely. There were no differences in the rates of depression, self-harm, and suicide between finasteride and dutasteride, suggesting that the specific 5-ARI used does not influence the risks. The absolute risks of self-harm and depression with 5-ARIs remain low (0.14% and 2.0%, respectively).

==Pharmacology==
The pharmacology of 5α-reductase inhibition is complex, but involves the binding of NADPH to the enzyme followed by the substrate. Specific substrates include testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, epitestosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, and deoxycorticosterone. The entire physiologic effect of their reduction is unknown, but likely related to their excretion or is itself physiologic. 5α-Reductase reduces the steroid Δ4,5 double bond in testosterone to its more active form DHT. Thus, inhibition results in decreased amounts of DHT. Because of this, slight elevations in testosterone and estradiol levels occur. The 5α-reductase reaction is a rate-limiting step in the testosterone reduction and involves the binding of NADPH to the enzyme followed by the substrate.

::: &quot;Substrate + NADPH + H+ → 5α-substrate + NADP+&quot;

Beyond being a catalyst in the rate-limiting step in testosterone reduction, 5α-reductase isoforms I and II reduce progesterone to 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP) and deoxycorticosterone to dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). In vitro and animal models suggest subsequent 3α-reduction of DHT, 5α-DHP and DHDOC lead to neurosteroid metabolites with effect on cerebral function. These neurosteroids, which include allopregnanolone, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), and 3α-androstanediol, act as potent positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors, and have antidepressant, anxiolytic, prosexual, and anticonvulsant effects. 5α-Dihydrocortisol is present in the aqueous humor of the eye, is synthesized in the lens, and might help make the aqueous humor itself. 5α-Dihydroaldosterone is a potent antinatriuretic agent, although different from aldosterone. Its formation in the kidney is enhanced by restriction of dietary salt, suggesting it may help retain sodium. 5α-DHP is a major hormone in circulation of normal cycling and pregnant women.

Other enzymes compensate to a degree for the absent conversion of 5α-reductase, specifically with local expression at the skin of reductive 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and oxidative 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes.

In BPH, DHT acts as a potent cellular androgen and promotes prostate growth; therefore, DHT blockers inhibit and alleviate symptoms of BPH. In alopecia, male and female-pattern baldness is an effect of androgenic receptor activation, so reducing levels of DHT also reduces hair loss.

==History==
Finasteride was the first 5-ARI to be introduced for medical use. It was marketed for the treatment of BPH in 1992 and was subsequently approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss in 1997. Epristeride was the second 5-ARI to be introduced and was marketed for the treatment of BPH in China in 2000. Dutasteride was approved for the treatment of BPH in 2001 and was subsequently approved for pattern hair loss in South Korea in 2009 and in Japan in 2015. The patent protection on finasteride and dutasteride has expired and both drugs are available as generic medications.

==Research==
5-ARIs have been studied in combination with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer.

<doc id="1284675" wikidata="Q420012" url="?curid=1284675" title="Myeloperoxidase">
<text>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a peroxidase enzyme that in humans is encoded by the &quot;MPO&quot; gene on chromosome 17. MPO is most abundantly expressed in neutrophils (a subtype of white blood cells), and produces hypohalous acids to carry out their antimicrobial activity, including hypochlorous acid, the sodium salt of which is the chemical in bleach. It is a lysosomal protein stored in azurophilic granules of the neutrophil and released into the extracellular space during degranulation. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase has a heme pigment, which causes its green color in secretions rich in neutrophils, such as mucus and sputum. The green color contributed to its outdated name verdoperoxidase.

Myeloperoxidase is found in many different organisms including mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Myeloperoxidase deficiency is a well-documented disease among humans resulting in impaired immune function.

== Function ==
MPO is a member of the XPO subfamily of peroxidases and produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and chloride anion (Cl−) (or hypobromous acid if Br- is present) during the neutrophil&#x27;s respiratory burst. It requires heme as a cofactor. Furthermore, it oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent.

However, this hypochlorous acid may also cause oxidative damage in host tissue. Moreover, MPO oxidation of apoA-I reduces HDL-mediated inhibition of apoptosis and inflammation. In addition, MPO mediates protein nitrosylation and the formation of 3-chlorotyrosine and dityrosine crosslinks.

Myeloperoxidase is the first and so far only human enzyme known to break down carbon nanotubes, allaying a concern among clinicians that using nanotubes for targeted delivery of medicines would lead to an unhealthy buildup of nanotubes in tissues.

=== Role in innate immunity ===
Neutrophils use myeloperoxidase to produce the substances needed for their respiratory burst. Hypochlorous acid and tyrosyl radical are cytotoxic, so they are used by the neutrophil to kill bacteria and certain types of fungi.

== Structure ==

The 150-kDa MPO protein is a cationic heterotetramer consisting of two 15-kDa light chains and two variable-weight glycosylated heavy chains bound to a prosthetic heme group complex with calcium ions, arranged as a homodimer of heterodimers. Both are proteolytically generated from the precursor peptide encoded by the &quot;MPO&quot; gene. The light chains are glycosylated and contain the modified iron protoporphyrin IX active site. Together, the light and heavy chains form two identical 73-kDa monomers connected by a cystine bridge at Cys153. The protein forms a deep crevice which holds the heme group at the bottom, as well as a hydrophobic pocket at the entrance to the distal heme cavity which carries out its catalytic activity.

Variation in glycosylation and the identity of the heavy chain lead to variations in molecular weight within the 135-200 kDa range. In mice, three isoforms exist, differing only by the heavy chain.

One of the ligands is the carbonyl group of Asp 96. Calcium-binding is important for structure of the active site because of Asp 96&#x27;s close proximity to the catalytic His95 side chain.

=== Reaction mechanism ===
The central heme group acts as the active site. The reaction starts when hydrogen peroxide donates an oxygen to the heme group, converting it to an activated form called &quot;Compound I&quot;. This compound then oxidizes the chloride ions to form the hypochlorous acid and Compound II, which can be reduced back down to its original heme state. This cycle continues for as long as the immune system requires.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Myeloperoxidase deficiency ===

Myeloperoxidase deficiency is a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme, which causes a mild immune deficiency against certain pathogens. People with myeloperoxidase deficiency are most at risk of infection by &quot;Candida&quot; species, which are pathogenic fungi. The most common species found in humans is &quot;Candida albicans&quot;. There may be an increased risk of certain other infections, such as with &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, but recurrent candidiasis is the only common clinical consequence, if the patient is noticeably affected at all.

=== Vasculitis ===
Antibodies against MPO have been implicated in various types of vasculitis, most prominently three clinically and pathologically recognized forms: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA); and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Antibodies are also known as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), though ANCAs have also been detected in staining of the perinuclear region.

=== Atherosclerosis and heart disease ===
Myeloperoxidase is known to contribute to atherosclerosis and diseases related to it, including coronary artery disease. MPO oxidizes LDL cholesterol, and as a result, the LDL receptor in liver cells becomes unable to bind to LDL and remove it from the blood stream. However, in its oxidized state, LDL can still contribute to foam cell formation and other atherosclerotic processes. Thus, elevated levels of MPO are a risk factor for atherosclerosis.

=== Medical tests ===

An initial 2003 study suggested that MPO could serve as a sensitive predictor for myocardial infarction in patients presenting with chest pain. Since then, there have been over 100 published studies documenting the utility of MPO testing. The 2010 Heslop et al. study reported that measuring both MPO and CRP (C-reactive protein; a general and cardiac-related marker of inflammation) provided added benefit for risk prediction than just measuring CRP alone.

Immunohistochemical staining for myeloperoxidase used to be administered in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia to demonstrate that the leukemic cells were derived from the myeloid lineage. Myeloperoxidase staining is still important in the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma, contrasting with the negative staining of lymphomas, which can otherwise have a similar appearance. In the case of screening patients for vasculitis, flow cytometric assays have demonstrated comparable sensitivity to immunofluorescence tests, with the additional benefit of simultaneous detection of multiple autoantibodies relevant to vasculitis. Nonetheless, this method still requires further testing.

=== Inhibitors of MPO ===

Azide has been used traditionally as an MPO inhibitor, but 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABH) is a more specific inhibitor of MPO.

<text>Alba Raquel Barros (born 14 December 1952 in Santurce, Puerto Rico) is an actress, comedian, and dancer. She is better known for her acting career, and she has won many national awards for her work, both in the television and theatrical fields.

== Biography ==

Barros participated in a rendition of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; as a student at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR).

Barros began her rise to fame as a telenovela actress in Puerto Rico&#x27;s channel 2 during the 1970s. She participated in some of that channel&#x27;s most famous soap operas.

By the early 1980s, she had moved to WAPA-TV, where she acted in some of that channel&#x27;s most famous shows, including 1982&#x27;s soap, &quot;Yo Sé Que Mentía&quot; (&quot;I know he was lying&quot;), with Iris Chacón, the mini series, &quot;Las Divorciadas&quot;, (&quot;The Divorced Women&quot;), with Sonia Noemí and Maribella Garcia, as well as 1984&#x27;s sitcom, &quot;Barrio Cuatro Calles&quot;. In the latter comedy she played a Puerto Rican girl who had been born in New York City therefore she used an Americanized, or Nuyorican, accent. She played the wife of Miguel Ángel Álvarez, who played a bakery owner. They played opposite legendary Cuban actor Pucho Fernández and Yasmín Mejías.

She has participated at the theatrical versions of many of Latin America&#x27;s most famous novels, including &quot;La Carreta&quot;, &quot;Orinoco&quot;, &quot;La Clase del 69&quot; and others.

The famous Chilean show host and producer, Don Francisco has invited Barros many times to his Univision show &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;. Barros has participated as a comedian a number of times on that television show.

Barros&#x27; acting career has not been limited to television and theater, however, as she has participated in a number of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most important productions of all times, including &quot;Nicolas y los demas&quot; (&quot;Nicholas and the others&quot;), directed by and starred Jacobo Morales, &quot;Héroes de Otra Patria&quot; (&quot;Heroes for Another Nation&quot;, which protested the participation of Puerto Ricans in the United States military, particularly during the Vietnam War era), and &quot;Los Diaz de Doris&quot;.

In 2002, Barros moved to Venezuela to act there, after being signed by Venevision. She appeared in &quot;Ángel Rebelde&quot; as Simona Ramirez.

In 2008, she acted in Telemundo&#x27;s &quot;El Rostro de Analía&quot; where she played Dionisia Valdez.

In 2010, she acted in Telemundo&#x27;s &quot;Alguien Te Mira&quot; where she played Yoyita.

==Awards==
These are some of the awards Barros has received over the years:
* Outstanding comedy actress of the year (Puerto Rico, 1985)
* Comedian of the year (Puerto Rico, 1986)
* Best female actress (Puerto Rico, 1986)
* Best soap opera starring role (Puerto Rico, 1987)
* Best actress (Puerto Rico, 1988)
* Best actress in a supporting role, Critics Circle Award Theater of Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico, 1990)

<text>The speaker of the Knesset (, ) is the presiding officer of the Knesset, the unicameral legislature of Israel. The Speaker also acts as President of Israel when the President is incapacitated. The current speaker is Amir Ohana, who was elected on 29 December 2022.

==Position==
The Speaker and their deputies are elected by members of the Knesset. Until a Speaker is elected, the oldest Knesset member who is not the prime minister, the prime minister-elect, a minister or deputy minister, serves as acting speaker.

The Speaker is responsible for conducting the affairs of the Knesset and representing the Knesset. They are also charged with preserving the dignity of the Knesset, the decorum of its sittings and observance of Knesset rules of procedure.

The Speaker is assisted by a number of Deputy Speakers. Together, the Speaker and Deputy Speakers constitute the Presidium of the Knesset. The Presidium sets the Knesset agenda.

Ahdut HaAvoda&#x27;s Nahum Nir and Blue &amp; White&#x27;s Benny Gantz are the only Speakers not to have come from the ruling party, though in two cases (Avraham Burg and Reuven Rivlin) the party of the speaker (One Israel and Likud respectively) lost power during their term.

The Speaker is expected to act in a non-partisan nature, but may occasionally take part in debates, and is allowed to vote.

==List of Knesset speakers==
A total of twenty people have served as Speaker of the Knesset, two of whom, Reuven Rivlin and Yariv Levin, have served two non-consecutive terms.

<text>The M-87 Orkan (from ) is a Yugoslav fully automated self-propelled multiple rocket launcher. The generic M-87 project was configured with 12 launch tubes mounted on a FAP 2832 truck. It has a range of about 50 to 120 km, with the ability to deliver warheads, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. The production of Orkan M-87 ceased in the early 1990s due to the breakup of Yugoslavia.

==History==
Development started as a joint Yugoslav and Iraqi project under the name of KOL-15 with professor Obrad Vučurović as a concept designer and chief engineer on the project. In early talks with Iraq, Yugoslavia offered two options:
*Development of a MRL with 12 barrels and a 50 km range
*Development of a MRL with 4 barrels and a 120 km range
Iraq chose the first option as did Yugoslavia.

At the start of development, two prototypes were built: one for Yugoslavia and one for Iraq. In accordance with requests from purchasers, rockets were developed with cluster warheads.

According to the chief operating officer of the Artillery department of Military Technical Institute professor Obrad Vučurović, Orkan was never a copy of any previous designs. The Yugoslav doctrine when developing the system was based on the premise that countries who copy designs are at least five years behind those who have the weapons developed.

==Characteristics==
One battery of M-87 Orkans consists of:
*four 8×8 launchers
*four 8×8 resupply vehicles (each with 24 rockets)
*one 8×8 command post vehicle
*two 4×4 topographic survey light vehicles
*two 4×4 observation post-light vehicles
*one 4×4 meteorological survey vehicle

The FAP 2832 vehicle with its base platform is fitted with a central tyre pressure regulation system which is operated by the driver from within the cab, and to provide a more stable firing platform. Four stabilisers are lowered to the ground by remote control, one at either side to the rear of the second roadwheel and two at the very rear. When travelling, the launcher is traversed to the front and the whole launcher is covered by a tarpaulin cover with integral bows.

===Rockets===
The rocket is 4.6 metres long and it is packed in a glass-ceramic housing and transported by vehicle. Rockets are reloaded by the FAP 3232 with a built-in crane. 
The rocket speed is 1000 m/s. Rockets with extended range are 4.88 m long and weigh 404  kg. A battery of 4 launchers with 16 barrels and 192 rockets can cover a target area of 3–4 km².

The following types of rockets are known:
*M-87-APHE with a fragmentation warhead to 91 kg. Range 50 km.
*M-87-APHE-ER with a fragmentation warhead to 91 kg. Range 65 km. 
*M-87-PFHE-ER pre-fragmented warhead containing double-size balls. Range 65 km. 
*M-87-ICM-AT with 288 piece shaped charge bomblets type KB-2 . Range 50 km.
*M-87-ICM-AP with 420 piece splinter bomblets. Range 50 km. 
*M-87-AT with 24 piece YU-S-AT (KPOM) mines with Magnetos. Range 50 km.
Some of the rockets are no longer in production.

===Features===
Unique features at the time of introduction (1987) when compared to other MRLs operational at the time include:
* Ability to disperse anti-tank or anti-personnel mines up to 50 km from the firing location.
* Semi-automatic loading.
* Preparations to fire take two minutes.
* Automatic leveling. Automatic Leveling of weapon was very precise. The system has a TV camera corrector for correcting missile path.
*Automatic barrel sight. 
*Hard chromed barrels without the need for cleaning.
*Mines KB-2 with wings and parachutes with two fuses (magnetic and mechanism for self-destruction after 24 or up to 48 hours)

According to Obrad Vučurović, Orkan&#x27;s main feature was the ability to disperse anti-tank or anti-personnel mines from 5 to 50 km from the firing location.

==Modifications and versions==

There were a few modifications of Orkan M-87:
* The first modification was made by Army of Republika Srpska with two barrels placed on Luna R-65 launcher (ZIL-135).
* Serbia and Montenegro modified Krupp M-418/37 and placed two Orkan barrels on it.
* Serbia developed the M-96 Orkan II modification. The simplest solution was to integrate four 262mm launch tubes on a ZIL-135 launcher as it required minimum investment. The basic purpose of these modified launchers can be restored. Newly developed rockets increased range of Orkan II to 65 km.
* Orkan CER developed by Yugoimport SDPR based on KamAZ-6350.
* Dominator M2/12 MLRS multi-caliber multiple launch rocket system developed by Yugoimport SDPR which uses 16 262mm Orkan rockets.

===TOROS artillery rocket system===

In 1990s Turkey faced USA reluctance to share modern defense technology. In order to have domestic supply of multiple rocket launcher rockets and domestic launchers Turkey used reverse engineering and shortcuts in order to develop its own versions. In order to have a supply of 227mm rockets they reverse engineered M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System M26 rocket under project designation SAGE 227. For continuing work on development of domestic MRLS Turkey obtained Orkan M-87 documentation, launcher and rockets from Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s &quot;Bratstvo Novi Travnik&quot; factory in 1995. They used them for development of a domestic 260mm rockets and launcher thus shortening development for more than 5 years. First launches of new 230 and 260mm rockets respectively based on 227 M26 and 262 Orkan rockets produced in Turkey from Orkan M-87 launcher were conducted in April 1999.

==Operational history==
In May 1995, the Republic of Serbian Krajina used M-87 Orkan to attack Zagreb after Croatian forces captured territories previously occupied by Serbian forces.

==Operators==


===Current operators===
* - 4 M-96 Orkan II

===Former operators===
* - 1 non-operational unit in Banja Luka, 1 completed and 3 partially assembled units destroyed along with rockets. 
* - 1 in reserve due to lack of adequate rocket ammunition, 1 in a museum
* - four launchers and four reload vehicles. In 2000-2001, the reload vehicles were transformed into launchers, using modified SM-90 launchers from the S-75 Dvina SAM system, with six tubes instead of 12. No longer operational.
* - 9 + 1 prototype

<doc id="1284689" wikidata="Q463990" url="?curid=1284689" title="Harmonic Vector Excitation Coding">
<text>Harmonic Vector Excitation Coding, abbreviated as HVXC is a speech coding algorithm specified in MPEG-4 Part 3 (MPEG-4 Audio) standard for very low bit rate speech coding. HVXC supports bit rates of 2 and 4 kbit/s in the fixed and variable bit rate mode and sampling frequency of 8 kHz. It also operates at lower bitrates, such as 1.2 - 1.7 kbit/s, using a variable bit rate technique. The total algorithmic delay for the encoder and decoder is 36 ms.

It was published as subpart 2 of ISO/IEC 14496-3:1999 (MPEG-4 Audio) in 1999. An extended version of HVXC was published in MPEG-4 Audio Version 2 (ISO/IEC 14496-3:1999/Amd 1:2000).

MPEG-4 Natural Speech Coding Tool Set uses two algorithms: HVXC and CELP (Code Excited Linear Prediction). HVXC is used at a low bit rate of 2 or 4 kbit/s. Higher bitrates than 4 kbit/s in addition to 3.85 kbit/s are covered by CELP.

==Technology==

===Linear Predictive Coding===
HVXC uses Linear predictive coding (LPC) with block-wise adaptation every 20ms. The LPC parameters are transformed into Line spectral pair (LSP) coefficients, which are jointly quantized. The LPC residual signal is classified as either voiced or unvoiced. In the case of voiced speech, the residual is coded in a parametric representation (operating as a vocoder), while in the case of unvoiced speech, the residual waveform is quantized (thus operating as a hybrid speech codec).

===Voiced (Harmonic) Residual Coding===
In voiced segments, the residual signal is represented by two parameters: the pitch period and the spectral envelope. The pitch period is estimated from the peak values of the autocorrelation of the residual signal. In this process, the residual signal is compared against shifted copies of itself, and the shift which yields the greatest similarity by the measure of linear dependence is identified as the pitch period. The spectral envelope is represented by a set of amplitude values, one per harmonic. To extract these values, the LPC residual signal is transformed into the DFT-domain. The DFT-spectrum is segmented into bands, one band per harmonic. The frequency band for the m-th harmonic consists of the DFT-coefficients from (m-1/2)ω0 to (m+1/2)ω0, ω0 being the pitch frequency. The amplitude value for the m-th harmonic is chosen to optimally represent these DFT-coefficients. Phase information is discarded in this process. The spectral envelope is then coded using variable-dimension weighted vector quantization. This process is also referred to as Harmonic VQ.

To make a speech with a mixture of voiced and unvoiced excitation sound more natural and smooth, three different modes of voiced speech (Mixed Voiced-1, Mixed Voiced-2, Full Voiced) are differentiated. The degree of voicing is determined by the value of the normalized autocorrelation function at a shift of one pitch period. Depending on the chosen mode, different amounts of band-pass Gaussian noise are added to the synthesized harmonic signal by the decoder.

===Voiceless (VXC) Residual Coding===
Unvoiced segments are encoded according to the CELP scheme, which is also referred to as vector excitation coding (VXC). The CELP coding in HVXQ is performed using only a stochastic codebook. In other CELP codecs, a dynamic codebook is used additionally to perform long-term prediction of voiced segments. However, since HVXC does not use CELP for voiced segments, the dynamic codebook is omitted from the design.

<doc id="1284695" wikidata="Q765478" url="?curid=1284695" title="Târnava">
<text>The Târnava (full name in ; ; ; ) is a river in Romania. It is formed by the confluence of the Târnava Mare and Târnava Mică in the town of Blaj. The Târnava flows into the Mureș after 23 km near the town of Teiuș. The two source rivers of the Târnava are the Târnava Mare and Târnava Mică, and its tributaries include the Tur, Izvorul Iezerului, Secaș, and the Dunărița. Its drainage basin covers an area of .

== Etymology ==

The name Târnava is of Slavic origin from &quot;trn&quot;, meaning &quot;thorn&quot;.

Other proposed origins for the river&#x27;s Romanian name is &quot;Turn&quot; (tower) + &quot;dav&quot; from Dacian &quot;dava&quot; (structure/fortress), i.e. &quot;the river that flows amongst towers and &quot;davas&quot;&quot;; or a reference to the Romanian city of Turda, forming &quot;Tur&quot; + &quot;ava&quot; from &quot;dava&quot;.

&quot;Trn&quot; (thorn) is used by Slavic peoples in the Balkans, Czechia and Slovakia, but the 60% R1a Slavs (Poles, Belarusians, Russians) say &quot;syp/ship&quot;.

The Hungarian name Küküllő is of Old Turkic origin from &quot;kukel&quot; meaning sloe, and is thought to have originated from the Avar people.

<text>Sir Austin Chapman (10 July 186412 January 1926) was an Australian politician who served in the House of Representatives from 1901 until his death in 1926. He held ministerial office in the governments of Alfred Deakin and Stanley Bruce, serving as Minister for Defence (1903–1904), Postmaster-General (1905–1907), Minister for Trade and Customs (1907–1908, 1923–1924), and Minister for Health (1923–1924).

==Early life==
Chapman was born on 10 July 1864 in Bong Bong, New South Wales. He was the son of Monica (née Cain; also spelt Kean or Kein) and Richard Chapman, his father being a wheelwright and publican. His mother was born in Ireland. His given name was spelled &quot;Austen&quot; until 1897.

Chapman attended the state school in Marulan until the age of 14, when he was apprenticed to a saddler working in Goulburn and Mudgee. By 1885 he was operating Chapman&#x27;s Hotel in Bungendore, close to the eventual site of Canberra. Chapman moved to Sydney in 1887 and went into partnership with Edward William O&#x27;Sullivan in an auctioneering firm, of which he was managing partner. He was also the proprietor of the Emu Inn on Bathurst Street. His partnership with O&#x27;Sullivan was dissolved in 1889, and he subsequently established the Royal Hotel in Braidwood.

==New South Wales politics==
In 1891 Chapman was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as MLA for Braidwood. He was an active supporter of federation of the Australian colonies.

==Federal politics==

In 1901 Chapman was elected to the first House of Representatives as MP for the Division of Eden-Monaro (his brother Albert succeeded him as the member for Braidwood in the New South Wales Parliament). A Protectionist, he was Minister for Defence in the first ministry of Alfred Deakin (1903–04), Postmaster-General in the second Deakin ministry (1905–08), and Minister for Trade and Customs from 1907 to 1908. After a long period on the backbench as a result of a stroke in 1909, which paralysed one of his arms, he was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs and Minister for Health in the Bruce government in February 1923. He was criticised by both Nationalists and the Country Party and he resigned in May 1924 on the grounds of ill health and was subsequently made a KCMG.

Chapman had a significant role during the selection of Australia&#x27;s national capital site, Canberra. A strong advocate for the rival site of Dalgety—legislated as the capital site by the Seat of Government Act 1904—he stated in August 1906 that, &quot;I will defend Dalgety to the end. Any change from the selection already made can only be achieved over my political corpse.&quot;

In early 1908, he conceded that Canberra was &quot;the second best site, but Dalgety easily stands first.&quot; As the process finally reached its conclusion, later in 1908, Chapman was suffering ill health. In his absence, although he had been paired for the ballots so as not to prejudice the outcome, at the ninth ballot Dalgety went down to Yass-Canberra by 39 votes to 33.

However, once Canberra had been selected, Chapman strenuously advocated the development of the site on the Molonglo River near Queanbeyan, which like Dalgety was in his electorate. The success of his efforts benefited many of his friends who owned land in the area, and also greatly boosted trade in Queanbeyan, the nearest town to the site. He was still MP for Eden-Monaro at the time of his death in Sydney on 12 January 1926 of cerebro-vascular disease, before he could sit in the first Parliament House in Canberra, which opened in May 1927. He was survived by his wife, two daughters and two sons, James Austin Chapman and John Austin Chapman who both became distinguished soldiers. The Canberra suburb of Chapman was named after him.

<text>Bob Tomalski (7 February 1953 – 13 January 2001), was a journalist, &quot;gadget guru&quot;, broadcaster and longtime proponent of radio broadcasting freedom. He founded &quot;Home Cinema Choice&quot; magazine and contributed to many other magazines on the subjects of TV, video, satellite TV, mobile phones and camcorders. He also appeared regularly on Sky News&#x27; weekly &quot;Technofile&quot; programme, reviewing gadgets alongside presenter Martin Stanford and was a regular contributor to &quot;Media Network&quot;, a communications magazine on the English service of Radio Netherlands.

== Career ==
Tomalski started his broadcasting career on the south west London pirate scene of the 1970s, when he was the host of &quot;Roger Tate&#x27;s Mailbox Show&quot; on European Music Radio, and later became a licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign G6CQF.

His maisonette in Mitcham, Surrey was equipped with a broadcast-quality mixing desk and two Nakamichi cassette decks, alongside the high-quality turntables. These were complemented by a collection of several thousand albums, mainly of his favourite genre; soul and funk, but topped up with many chart albums and a few hundred 60s and 70s rock records. He was also a collector of state of the art video equipment.

Tomalski was a co-founder of Wandle Valley Radio (WVR) in 1984, still under the pseudonym &quot;Roger Tate&quot;, broadcasting a soul/funk/hi-energy programme - he was a friend of the hi-NRG artist Hazell Dean - alongside Alan Rogers and Paul James (both pseudonyms). He provided the studio facilities for the station, which was amongst the pioneers of microwave links from the studio to the FM Band II transmitter, a technology later very widely used in pirate radio. Another technology which Tomalski pioneered was that of computer data transmission via Band II FM radio - raw data transmitted onto the audio signal with no subcarrier: WVR featured the &quot;Roger Tate Computer Program Programme&quot; with Tomalski introducing (after the music had ended for the night) half an hour of 8-bit data sounds played from a Nakamichi cassette deck, representing programs for the BBC Micro and the Tandy TRS-80 microcomputers, among others. Feedback on the programme and Tomalski was positive.

His home studio was raided in the late 80s after alleged transmission offences, and the Home Office even went as far as confiscating his electric kettle (as well as the studio gear), on the grounds that it was connected to the same ring main as his transmitting equipment.
In his subsequent radio career, Tomalski was a regular contributor to &quot;You and Yours&quot; and &quot;The Big Byte&quot; on BBC Radio. He also broadcast for Radio Mercury and Radio Invicta (which also sparked the career of Steve Walsh), and was the resident &#x27;Inspector Gadget&#x27; on the LBC &quot;Weekend Wireless Show&quot;, talking about the week&#x27;s technology news, reviewing gadgets and answering listener queries.

In 2022, Tomalski was uncovered as the person that carried out the Southern Television broadcast interruption on 26th November 1977.

<text>Ebenezer Remilekun Aremu Olasupo Obey-Fabiyi (born 3 April 1942), known professionally as Ebenezer Obey, is a Nigerian jùjú musician.

==Early life==
Obey was born on 3 April 1942 to an Egba–Yoruba ethnic background family. Obey, whose real names are Ebenezer Remilekun Aremu Olasupo Fabiyi, was born in Idogo, Ogun State, Nigeria of Egba-Yoruba ethnic background. He is of the Owu subgroup of the Egba.

==Career==
Ebenezer Obey began his professional career in the mid-1950s after moving to Lagos. After tutelage under Fatai Rolling-Dollar&#x27;s band, he formed a band called The International Brothers in 1964, playing highlife–jùjú fusion. The band later metamorphosed into Inter-Reformers in the early-1970s, with a long list of Juju album hits on the West African Decca musical label.

Obey began experimenting with Yoruba percussion style and expanding on the band by adding more drum kits, guitars and talking drums. Obey&#x27;s musical strengths lie in weaving intricate Yoruba axioms into dance-floor compositions. As is characteristic of Nigerian Yoruba social-circle music, the Inter-Reformers band excel in praise-singing for rich Nigerian socialites and business tycoons. Obey, however, is also renowned for Christian spiritual themes in his music and has since the early-1990s retired into Nigerian gospel music ministry. It will be worthy of note to also say that Chief Commander just as he is fondly called by his fans, has played alongside popular gospel music veteran, Pastor Kunle Ajayi during his 30 years on stage concert in Lagos.

==Personal life==
Obey married Juliana Olaide Olufade in 1963. His wife, known as Lady Evangelist Juliana Obey-Fabiyi, died at Lagos State University Teaching Hospital on 23 August 2011, aged 67. They have several children and grand children.

<text>Kemopetrol is a Finnish band from Helsinki. The members of Kemopetrol are the vocalist Laura Närhi, the drummer Teemu Nordman, the guitarist Marko Soukka and the keyboardist Kalle Koivisto, who also writes the songs for Kemopetrol. Kemopetrol&#x27;s original bassist, Kari Myöhänen, left the band in July 2003. He was replaced by Lauri Hämäläinen who in turn left in 2008. All Kemopetrol songs have English lyrics. The name of the band originates from a Czech ice hockey team named Chemopetrol Litvínov.

==History==
Marko Soukka and Kalle Koivisto founded Kemopetrol in November 1998, originally as an ambient music project. In December on the same year Koivisto met Laura Närhi at a party and later introduced her some songs he had written.

Laura Närhi joined the band in January 1999, followed by drummer Teemu Nordman and bassist Kari Myöhänen later same year. The band went to studio in July.

Kemopetrol&#x27;s first single &quot;Child Is My Name&quot; was released at the end of 1999 and was a breakthrough success. In 2000, their debut album &quot;Slowed Down&quot; was released. &quot;Slowed Down&quot; contains music that is a mixture of rock, jazz and electronic music.

In 2001, a two-CD edition of the album &quot;Slowed Down&quot; was released. One CD is identical to the first release of &quot;Slowed Down&quot;, the other CD contains remixes and live performances. In addition to numerous gigs in Finland, the band also performed in Spain and Italy.

In March 2002, the single &quot;Saw It on TV&quot; and, two months later, the album &quot;Everything’s Fine&quot; were released.

In 2004, the single &quot;My Superstar&quot; and the album &quot;Play for Me&quot; were released. Having Kari left the band the previous year, on those releases, Kemopetrol&#x27;s producer Kalle Chydenius plays bass. Shortly after the release of &quot;Play for Me&quot;, Lauri Hämäläinen joined the band as the new permanent bassist.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Teleport&quot; was released on 29 March 2006, preceded by &quot;Planet&quot;-single on 8 March. The album features disco influences from the 80&#x27;s, including notable usage of synthesizer sounds from that era.

Laura Närhi also sings solo. She performs the song &quot;Se ei mee pois&quot;, which is found on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Kuutamolla&quot;. She also provides the vocals for the Alimo&amp;Control song &quot;Tarkkaillaan&quot;. Both &quot;Se ei mee pois&quot; and &quot;Tarkkaillaan&quot; have Finnish lyrics (and Finnish titles). Her first solo album &quot;Suuri sydän&quot; was released in August 2010.

The band started recording their fifth studio album in May 2008. Around this time, Lauri Hämäläinen left the band. In May 2010 the band announced that the recording of the album was on hold due to Laura&#x27;s solo schedule. The fifth album, named &quot;A song &amp; A Reason&quot; was released on 21 September 2011.

The band planned a 20th-anniversary tour for Slowed Down in 2020, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Kemopetrol performed several streaming concerts, summer festival gigs, and eventually a tour in the fall. On this tour, the band played Slowed Down in its entirety alongside selected tracks from other albums. The tour concluded with a sold-out show at Tavastia.

Kemopetrol released their sixth studio album Engine on January 24, 2025. The album was preceded by a series of single releases.

<text>Biruința (Romanian equivalent for &quot;Triumph&quot;), renamed Iris Star and later Histria Crown, is a Romanian crude oil tanker.

==History==
MT &quot;Biruința&quot; was one of the biggest ships of the Romanian commercial fleet, owned and managed by the then Romanian state owned Shipping Company (Navrom). It was sold after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, and six years of service, to the Romanian private shipping company &quot;Petromin&quot;, changing its name to M/T &quot;Iris Star&quot;. The ship was then bought by the Romanian shipping company Histria Shipmanagement having its name changed again to M/T &quot;Histria Crown&quot;, in 2005. 

In 2009, after an extensive refit in Keppel Shipyard (Singapore), the ship was converted into a FPSO (Floating production storage and offloading) and given a new name, &quot;Armada Perdana&quot;. It was still in use of the coast of Nigeria (Oyo Oil Field), as of 2018. In 2019, the ship was renamed &quot;Tamara Tokoni&quot;.

==Incidents==
On July 27, 2000, the ship lost power after an engine failure and drifted towards Kandilli point in Turkey. There was no extensive damage reported. 

==Sister ships==
M/T &quot;Biruința&quot; was the third of a series of five Romanian supertankers which were constructed by Constanța Shipyard in the 1980s. The sister ships were as follows:

M/T &quot;Independența&quot; (&quot;Independence&quot;) – suffered a more deadly accident with a Greek ship (&quot;Evriyali&quot;) at the southern entrance to the Bosporus. All but three members of the Romanian tanker crew died.

M/T &quot;Unirea&quot; (&quot;Union&quot;) – broke up and sank at the beginning of the 1980s in Bulgarian waters of the Black Sea. Official reports claim that the accident was caused by a collision with a World War II mine. A different opinion (unofficial) came from some naval architects and marine engineers stating that the ship broke up due to incorrect ballasting (the ship had no cargo at the moment of the accident).

M/T &quot;Libertatea&quot; (&quot;Liberty&quot;) – had the same history (including ownership) as her older sister M/T &quot;Biruinta&quot;. The ship, known then as M/T &quot;Histria Prestige&quot;, was broken up in 2005.

M/T &quot;Pacea&quot; (&quot;Peace&quot;) – was never fully completed. At the end of the 1980s it was passed to Czechoslovakia as a part of Romania&#x27;s foreign debt.

<text>The Aisne ( , , ; Picard: &quot;Ainne&quot;) is a river in northeastern France. It is a left tributary of the Oise. It gave its name to the French department of Aisne. It was known in the Roman period as Axona.

The river rises in the forest of Argonne, at Rembercourt-Sommaisne, near Sainte-Menehould. It flows north and then west before joining the Oise near Compiègne. The Aisne is long. Its main tributaries are the Vesle, the Aire and the Suippe. The Battle of the Axona was fought between the Romans and the Belgae near the Aisne in 57 BC. Three Battles of the Aisne were fought in the Aisne valley during the First World War.

==Places along the river==
Departments and towns along the river include:
* Meuse
* Marne: Sainte-Ménehould
* Ardennes: Vouziers, Rethel
* Aisne: Soissons
* Oise: Compiègne
* Aisne: Berny-Rivière

==Navigation==
The river Aisne was used for commercial navigation as early as the Celtic period, and rafts were floated from a long distance above the present limit of navigation at Vailly-sur-Aisne until the mid-19th century. Canalisation works were begun in 1836, at the same time as construction of the Canal lateral à l&#x27;Aisne. The canal was completed first, in 1841, then two years later the river navigation. Commercial traffic in &quot;péniches&quot; carrying 220 tonnes is still active, while recreational traffic is mainly private boats. The waterway is long, from the river Oise to the junction with the lateral canal, and has 7 locks. Through the lateral canal, it links with the Marne and the Canal de la Meuse.

===En route===
The kilometre distances continue the numbering from Canal latéral à l&#x27;Aisne from east to west.

<text>Music in Bashkortostan is the music of the peoples who live in Bashkortostan (Bashkirs, Russians, Tatars, Chuvashs, Mari, Udmurts, Ukrainians and others).

==History ==

The first major study of the music of Bashkortostan appeared in 1897, when ethnographer Rybakov S.G. wrote &quot;Music and Songs of the Ural&#x27;s Muslims and Studies of Their Way of Life&quot;. Later, Lebedinskiy L.N. collected numerous folk songs in Bashkortostan beginning in 1930. The 1968 foundation of the Ufa State Institute of Arts sponsored research in the field.

The &quot;quray&quot; (end-blown flute) is the most important instrument in the Bashkir ensemble; it is made from a special reed found only in the Ural Mountains. It is used in both traditional and modern popular music. Zahir Bayiq played some Enigma and own melodies.

The National Symphonic Orchestra of the Bashkortostan Republic was founded in 1992 under the leadership of Tahir Kamalov. It emerged as one of the major symphonies in late 20th century Russia.

G. Gaskarav, the first artistic leader of folk theatrical choreography of the Bashkir, founded a professional folk dance ensemble in 1939. This band has travelled across much of the world.

<doc id="1284759" wikidata="Q408228" url="?curid=1284759" title="Terpyridine">
<text>Terpyridine (2,2&#x27;;6&#x27;,2&quot;-terpyridine, often abbreviated to Terpy or Tpy) is a heterocyclic compound derived from pyridine. It is a white solid that is soluble in most organic solvents. The compound is mainly used as a ligand in coordination chemistry.

==Synthesis==
Terpyridine was first synthesized by G. Morgan and F. H. Burstall in 1932 by the oxidative coupling of pyridines. This method, however, proceeded in low yields. More efficient syntheses have since been described, mainly starting from 2-acetylpyridine. One method produces an enaminone by the reaction of 2-acetylpyridine with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. The base-catalyzed reaction of 2-acetylpyridine with carbon disulfide followed by alkylation with methyl iodide gives C5H4NCOCH=C(SMe)2. Condensation of this species with 2-acetylpyridine forms the related 1,5-diketone, which condenses with ammonium acetate to form a terpyridine. Treatment of this derivative with Raney nickel removes the thioether group.

Other methods have been developed for the synthesis of terpyridine and its substituted derivatives. Substituted terpyridines are also synthesized from palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. It can be prepared from bis-triazinyl pyridine.

==Properties==

Terpyridine is a tridentate ligand that binds metals at three meridional sites giving two adjacent 5-membered MN2C2 chelate rings. Terpyridine forms complexes with most transition metal ion as do other polypyridine compounds, such as 2,2&#x27;-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline. Complexes containing two terpyridine complexes, i.e. [M(Terpy)2]n+ are common. They differ structurally from the related [M(Bipy)3]n+ complexes in being achiral.

Terpyridine complexes, like other polypyridine complexes, exhibit characteristic optical and electrochemical properties: metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in the visible region, reversible reduction and oxidation, and fairly intense luminescence.

Because they are pi-acceptors, terpyridine and bipyridine tend to stabilize metals in lower oxidation states. For instance in acetonitrile solution, it is possible to generate the [M(Terpy)2]+ (M = Ni, Co).

<text>Fish locomotion is the various types of animal locomotion used by fish, principally by swimming. This is achieved in different groups of fish by a variety of mechanisms of propulsion, most often by wave-like lateral flexions of the fish&#x27;s body and tail in the water, and in various specialised fish by motions of the fins. The major forms of locomotion in fish are:
* Anguilliform, in which a wave passes evenly along a long slender body;
* Sub-carangiform, in which the wave increases quickly in amplitude towards the tail;
* Carangiform, in which the wave is concentrated near the tail, which oscillates rapidly;
* Thunniform, rapid swimming with a large powerful crescent-shaped tail; and
* Ostraciiform, with almost no oscillation except of the tail fin.
More specialized fish include movement by pectoral fins with a mainly stiff body, opposed sculling with dorsal and anal fins, as in the sunfish; and movement by propagating a wave along the long fins with a motionless body, as in the knifefish or featherbacks.

In addition, some fish can variously &quot;walk&quot; (i.e., crawl over land using the pectoral and pelvic fins), burrow in mud, leap out of the water and even glide temporarily through the air.

==Swimming==

=== Mechanism ===


Fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water. There are exceptions, but this is normally achieved by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail, generally getting larger as they go along. The vector forces exerted on the water by such motion cancel out laterally, but generate a net force backwards which in turn pushes the fish forward through the water. Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body and caudal fin, but many other species move mainly using their median and paired fins. The latter group swim slowly, but can turn rapidly, as is needed when living in coral reefs for example. But they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies and caudal fins.

Consider the tilapia shown in the diagram. Like most fish, the tilapia has a streamlined body shape reducing water resistance to movement and enabling the tilapia to cut easily through water. Its head is inflexible, which helps it maintain forward thrust. Its scales overlap and point backwards, allowing water to pass over the fish without unnecessary obstruction. Water friction is further reduced by mucus which tilapia secrete over their body.

The backbone is flexible, allowing muscles to contract and relax rhythmically and bring about undulating movement. A swim bladder provides buoyancy which helps the fish adjust its vertical position in the water column. A lateral line system allows it to detect vibrations and pressure changes in water, helping the fish to respond appropriately to external events.

Well developed fins are used for maintaining balance, braking and changing direction. The pectoral fins act as pivots around which the fish can turn rapidly and steer itself. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins control pitching, while the unpaired dorsal and anal fins reduce yawing and rolling. The caudal fin provides raw power for propelling the fish forward.

=== Body/caudal fin propulsion ===
There are five groups that differ in the fraction of their body that is displaced laterally:

==== Anguilliform ====

In the anguilliform group, containing some long, slender fish such as eels, there is little increase in the amplitude of the flexion wave as it passes along the body.

==== Subcarangiform ====


The subcarangiform group has a more marked increase in wave amplitude along the body with the vast majority of the work being done by the rear half of the fish. In general, the fish body is stiffer, making for higher speed but reduced maneuverability. Trout use sub-carangiform locomotion.

==== Carangiform ====

The carangiform group, named for the Carangidae, are stiffer and faster-moving than the previous groups. The vast majority of movement is concentrated in the very rear of the body and tail. Carangiform swimmers generally have rapidly oscillating tails.

==== Thunniform ====

The thunniform group contains high-speed long-distance swimmers, and is characteristic of tunas and is also found in several lamnid sharks. Here, virtually all the sideways movement is in the tail and the region connecting the main body to the tail (the peduncle). The tail itself tends to be large and crescent shaped.

====Ostraciiform ====
The ostraciiform group have no appreciable body wave when they employ caudal locomotion. Only the tail fin itself oscillates (often very rapidly) to create thrust. This group includes Ostraciidae.

=== Median/paired fin propulsion ===

Not all fish fit comfortably in the above groups. Ocean sunfish, for example, have a completely different system, the tetraodontiform mode, and many small fish use their pectoral fins for swimming as well as for steering and dynamic lift. Fish in the order Gymnotiformes possess electric organs along the length of their bodies and swim by undulating an elongated anal fin while keeping the body still, presumably so as not to disturb the electric field that they generate.

Many fish swim using combined behavior of their two pectoral fins or both their anal and dorsal fins. Different types of Median paired fin propulsion can be achieved by preferentially using one fin pair over the other, and include rajiform, diodontiform, amiiform, gymnotiform and balistiform modes.

====Rajiform====

Rajiform locomotion is characteristic of rays and skates, when thrust is produced by vertical undulations along large, well developed pectoral fins.

====Diodontiform====


Diodontiform locomotion propels the fish propagating undulations along large pectoral fins, as seen in the porcupinefish (Diodontidae).

====Amiiform====

Amiiform locomotion consists of undulations of a long dorsal fin while the body axis is held straight and stable, as seen in the bowfin.

====Gymnotiform====

Gymnotiform locomotion consists of undulations of a long anal fin, essentially upside down amiiform, seen in the South American knifefish &quot;Gymnotiformes&quot;.

====Balistiform====

In balistiform locomotion, both anal and dorsal fins undulate. It is characteristic of the family Balistidae (triggerfishes). It may also be seen in the Zeidae.

====Oscillatory====
Oscillation is viewed as pectoral-fin-based swimming and is best known as mobuliform locomotion. The motion can be described as the production of less than half a wave on the fin, similar to a bird wing flapping. Pelagic stingrays, such as the manta, cownose, eagle and bat rays use oscillatory locomotion.

=====Tetraodontiform=====

In tetraodontiform locomotion, the dorsal and anal fins are flapped as a unit, either in phase or exactly opposing one another, as seen in the Tetraodontiformes (boxfishes and pufferfishes). The ocean sunfish displays an extreme example of this mode.

=====Labriform=====

In labriform locomotion, seen in the wrasses (Labriformes), oscillatory movements of pectoral fins are either drag based or lift based. Propulsion is generated either as a reaction to drag produced by dragging the fins through the water in a rowing motion, or via lift mechanisms.

===Dynamic lift===
Bone and muscle tissues of fish are denser than water. To maintain depth, bony fish increase buoyancy by means of a gas bladder. Alternatively, some fish store oils or lipids for this same purpose. Fish without these features use dynamic lift instead. It is done using their pectoral fins in a manner similar to the use of wings by airplanes and birds. As these fish swim, their pectoral fins are positioned to create lift which allows the fish to maintain a certain depth. The two major drawbacks of this method are that these fish must stay moving to stay afloat and that they are incapable of swimming backwards or hovering.

===Hydrodynamics===

Similarly to the aerodynamics of flight, powered swimming requires animals to overcome drag by producing thrust. Unlike flying, however, swimming animals often do not need to supply much vertical force because the effect of buoyancy can counter the downward pull of gravity, allowing these animals to float without much effort. While there is great diversity in fish locomotion, swimming behavior can be classified into two distinct &quot;modes&quot; based on the body structures involved in thrust production, Median-Paired Fin (MPF) and Body-Caudal Fin (BCF). Within each of these classifications, there are numerous specifications along a spectrum of behaviours from purely undulatory to entirely oscillatory. In undulatory swimming modes, thrust is produced by wave-like movements of the propulsive structure (usually a fin or the whole body). Oscillatory modes, on the other hand, are characterized by thrust produced by swiveling of the propulsive structure on an attachment point without any wave-like motion.

====Body-caudal fin====
Most fish swim by generating undulatory waves that propagate down the body through the caudal fin. This form of undulatory locomotion is termed body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming on the basis of the body structures used; it includes anguilliform, sub-carangiform, carangiform, and thunniform locomotory modes, as well as the oscillatory ostraciiform mode.

===Adaptation===

Similar to adaptation in avian flight, swimming behaviors in fish can be thought of as a balance of stability and maneuverability. Because body-caudal fin swimming relies on more caudal body structures that can direct powerful thrust only rearwards, this form of locomotion is particularly effective for accelerating quickly and cruising continuously. body-caudal fin swimming is, therefore, inherently stable and is often seen in fish with large migration patterns that must maximize efficiency over long periods. Propulsive forces in median-paired fin swimming, on the other hand, are generated by multiple fins located on either side of the body that can be coordinated to execute elaborate turns. As a result, median-paired fin swimming is well adapted for high maneuverability and is often seen in smaller fish that require elaborate escape patterns.

The habitats occupied by fishes are often related to their swimming capabilities. On coral reefs, the faster-swimming fish species typically live in wave-swept habitats subject to fast water flow speeds, while the slower fishes live in sheltered habitats with low levels of water movement.

Fish do not rely exclusively on one locomotor mode, but are rather locomotor generalists, choosing among and combining behaviors from many available behavioral techniques. Predominantly body-caudal fin swimmers often incorporate movement of their pectoral, anal, and dorsal fins as an additional stabilizing mechanism at slower speeds, but hold them close to their body at high speeds to improve streamlining and reducing drag. Zebrafish have even been observed to alter their locomotor behavior in response to changing hydrodynamic influences throughout growth and maturation.

==Flight==
The transition of predominantly swimming locomotion directly to flight has evolved in a single family of marine fish, the Exocoetidae. Flying fish are not true fliers in the sense that they do not execute powered flight. Instead, these species glide directly over the surface of the ocean water without ever flapping their &quot;wings.&quot; Flying fish have evolved abnormally large pectoral fins that act as airfoils and provide lift when the fish launches itself out of the water. Additional forward thrust and steering forces are created by dipping the hypocaudal (i.e. bottom) lobe of their caudal fin into the water and vibrating it very quickly, in contrast to diving birds in which these forces are produced by the same locomotor module used for propulsion. Of the 64 extant species of flying fish, only two distinct body plans exist, each of which optimizes two different behaviors.

===Tradeoffs===

While most fish have caudal fins with evenly sized lobes (i.e. homocaudal), flying fish have an enlarged ventral lobe (i.e. hypocaudal) which facilitates dipping only a portion of the tail back onto the water for additional thrust production and steering.

Because flying fish are primarily aquatic animals, their body density must be close to that of water for buoyancy stability. This primary requirement for swimming, however, means that flying fish are heavier (have a larger mass) than other habitual fliers, resulting in higher wing loading and lift to drag ratios for flying fish compared to a comparably sized bird. Differences in wing area, wing span, wing loading, and aspect ratio have been used to classify flying fish into two distinct classifications based on these different aerodynamic designs.

===Biplane body plan===
In the biplane or &quot;Cypselurus&quot; body plan, both the pectoral and pelvic fins are enlarged to provide lift during flight. These fish also tend to have &quot;flatter&quot; bodies which increase the total lift-producing area, thus allowing them to &quot;hang&quot; in the air better than more streamlined shapes. As a result of this high lift production, these fish are excellent gliders and are well adapted for maximizing flight distance and duration.

Comparatively, &quot;Cypselurus&quot; flying fish have lower wing loading and smaller aspect ratios (i.e. broader wings) than their &quot;Exocoetus&quot; monoplane counterparts, which contributes to their ability to fly for longer distances than fish with this alternative body plan. Flying fish with the biplane design take advantage of their high lift production abilities when launching from the water by utilizing a &quot;taxiing glide&quot; in which the hypocaudal lobe remains in the water to generate thrust even after the trunk clears the water&#x27;s surface and the wings are opened with a small angle of attack for lift generation.

===Monoplane body plan===
In the &quot;Exocoetus&quot; or monoplane body plan, only the pectoral fins are enlarged to provide lift. Fish with this body plan tend to have a more streamlined body, higher aspect ratios (long, narrow wings), and higher wing loading than fish with the biplane body plan, making these fish well adapted for higher flying speeds. Flying fish with a monoplane body plan demonstrate different launching behaviors from their biplane counterparts. Instead of extending their duration of thrust production, monoplane fish launch from the water at high speeds at a large angle of attack (sometimes up to 45 degrees). In this way, monoplane fish are taking advantage of their adaptation for high flight speed, while fish with biplane designs exploit their lift production abilities during takeoff.

==Walking==


A &quot;walking fish&quot; is a fish that is able to travel over land for extended periods of time. Some other cases of nonstandard fish locomotion include fish &quot;walking&quot; along the sea floor, such as the handfish or frogfish.

Most commonly, walking fish are amphibious fish. Able to spend longer times out of water, these fish may use a number of means of locomotion, including springing, snake-like lateral undulation, and tripod-like walking. The mudskippers are probably the best land-adapted of contemporary fish and are able to spend days moving about out of water and can even climb mangroves, although to only modest heights. The Climbing gourami is often specifically referred to as a &quot;walking fish&quot;, although it does not actually &quot;walk&quot;, but rather moves in a jerky way by supporting itself on the extended edges of its gill plates and pushing itself by its fins and tail. Some reports indicate that it can also climb trees.

There are a number of fish that are less adept at actual walking, such as the walking catfish. Despite being known for &quot;walking on land&quot;, this fish usually wriggles and may use its pectoral fins to aid in its movement. Walking Catfish have a respiratory system that allows them to live out of water for several days. Some are invasive species. A notorious case in the United States is the Northern snakehead. Polypterids have rudimentary lungs and can also move about on land, though rather clumsily. The Mangrove rivulus can survive for months out of water and can move to places like hollow logs.
There are some species of fish that can &quot;walk&quot; along the sea floor but not on land; one such animal is the flying gurnard (it does not actually fly, and should not be confused with flying fish). The batfishes of the family Ogcocephalidae (not to be confused with batfish of Ephippidae) are also capable of walking along the sea floor. &quot;Bathypterois grallator&quot;, also known as a &quot;tripodfish&quot;, stands on its three fins on the bottom of the ocean and hunts for food. The African lungfish (&quot;P. annectens&quot;) can use its fins to &quot;walk&quot; along the bottom of its tank in a manner similar to the way amphibians and land vertebrates use their limbs on land.
==Burrowing==
Many fishes, particularly eel-shaped fishes such as true eels, moray eels, and spiny eels, are capable of burrowing through sand or mud. Ophichthids, the snake eels, are capable of burrowing either forwards or backwards.

Fish larvae, like many adult fishes, swim by undulating their body. The swimming speed varies proportionally with the size of the animals, in that smaller animals tend to swim at lower speeds than larger animals. The swimming mechanism is controlled by the flow regime of the larvae. Reynolds number (Re) is defined as the ratio of inertial force to viscous force. Smaller organisms are affected more by viscous forces, like friction, and swim at a smaller Reynolds number. Larger organisms use a larger proportion of inertial forces, like pressure, to swim, at a higher Reynolds number.

The larvae of ray finned fishes, the Actinopterygii, swim at a quite large range of Reynolds number (Re ≈10 to 900). This puts them in an intermediate flow regime where both inertial and viscous forces play an important role. As the size of the larvae increases, the use of pressure forces to swim at higher Reynolds number increases.

Undulatory swimmers generally shed at least two types of wake: Carangiform swimmers shed connected vortex loops and Anguilliform swimmers shed individual vortex rings. These vortex rings depend upon the shape and arrangement of the trailing edge from which the vortices are shed. These patterns depend upon the swimming speed, ratio of swimming speed to body wave speed and the shape of body wave.

A spontaneous bout of swimming has three phases. The first phase is the start or acceleration phase: In this phase the larva tends to rotate its body to make a &#x27;C&#x27; shape which is termed the preparatory stroke. It then pushes in the opposite direction to straighten its body, which is called a propulsive stroke, or a power stroke, which powers the larva to move forward. The second phase is cyclic swimming. In this phase, the larva swims with an approximately constant speed. The last phase is deceleration. In this phase, the swimming speed of the larva gradually slows down to a complete stop. In the preparatory stroke, due to the bending of the body, the larva creates 4 vortices around its body, and 2 of those are shed in the propulsive stroke. Similar phenomena can be seen in the deceleration phase. However, in the vortices of the deceleration phase, a large area of elevated vorticity can be seen compared to the starting phase.

The swimming abilities of larval fishes are important for survival. This is particularly true for the larval fishes with higher metabolic rate and smaller size which makes them more susceptible to predators. The swimming ability of a reef fish larva helps it to settle at a suitable reef and for locating its home as it is often isolated from its home reef in search of food. Hence the swimming speed of reef fish larvae are quite high (≈12 cm/s - 100 cm/s) compared to other larvae. The swimming speeds of larvae from the same families at the two locations are relatively similar. However, the variation among individuals is quite large. At the species level, length is significantly related to swimming ability. However, at the family level, only 16% of variation in swimming ability can be explained by length. There is also a negative correlation between the fineness ratio (length of body to maximum width) and the swimming ability of reef fish larvae. This suggests a minimization of overall drag and maximization of volume. Reef fish larvae differ significantly in their critical swimming speed abilities among taxa which leads to high variability in sustainable swimming speed. This again leads to sustainable variability in their ability to alter dispersal patterns, overall dispersal distances and control their temporal and spatial patterns of settlement.

=== Hydrodynamics ===

Small undulatory swimmers such as fish larvae experience both inertial and viscous forces, the relative importance of which is indicated by Reynolds number (Re). Reynolds number is proportional to body size and swimming speed. The swimming performance of a larva increases between 2–5 days post fertilization. Compared with adults, larval fish experience relatively high viscous force. To enhance thrust to an equal level with the adults, it increases its tail beat frequency and thus amplitude. In zebrafish, tail beat frequency increases over larval age to 95 Hz in 3 days post fertilization from 80 Hz in 2 days post fertilization. This higher frequency leads to higher swimming speed, thus reducing predation and increasing prey catching ability when they start feeding at around 5 days post fertilization. The vortex shedding mechanics changes with the flow regime in an inverse non-linear way. Strouhal number is a design parameter for the vortex shedding mechanism. It can be defined as a ratio of the product of tail beat frequency with amplitude with the mean swimming speed. Reynolds number (Re) is the main deciding criteria of a flow regime. It has been observed over different type of larval experiments that, slow larvae swims at higher Strouhal number but lower Reynolds number. However, the faster larvae swims distinctively at opposite conditions, that is, at lower Strouhal number but higher Reynolds number. Strouhal number is constant over similar speed ranged adult fishes. Strouhal number does not only depend on the small size of the swimmers, but also dependent to the flow regime. As in fishes which swim in viscous or high-friction flow regime, would create high body drag which will lead to higher Strouhal number. Whereas, in high viscous regime, the adults swim at lower stride length which leads to lower tail beat frequency and lower amplitude. This leads to higher thrust for same displacement or higher propulsive force, which unanimously reduces the Reynolds number.

Larval fishes start feeding at 5–7 days post fertilization. And they experience extreme mortality rate (≈99%) in the few days after feeding starts. The reason for this &#x27;Critical Period&#x27; (Hjort-1914) is mainly hydrodynamic constraints. Larval fish fail to eat even if there are enough prey encounters. One of the primary determinants of feeding success is the size of larval body. The smaller larvae function in a lower Reynolds number (Re) regime. As the age increases, the size of the larvae increases, which leads to higher swimming speed and increased Reynolds number. It has been observed through many experiments that the Reynolds number of successful strikes (Re~200) is much higher than the Reynolds number of failed strikes (Re~20). Numerical analysis of suction feeding at a low Reynolds number concluded that around 40% energy invested in mouth opening is lost to frictional forces rather than contributing to accelerating the fluid towards mouth. Ontogenetic improvement in the sensory system, coordination and experiences are non-significant relationship while determining feeding success of larvae A successful strike positively depends upon the peak flow speed or the speed of larvae at the time of strike. The peak flow speed is also dependent on the gape speed or the speed of opening the buccal cavity to capture food. As the larva ages, its body size increase and its gape speed also increase, which cumulatively increase the successful strike outcomes. 

The ability of a larval prey to survive an encounter with predator totally depends on its ability to sense and evade the strike. Adult fishes exhibit rapid suction feeding strikes as compared to larval fishes. Sensitivity of larval fish to velocity and flow fields provides the larvae a critical defense against predation. Though many prey use their visual system to detect and evade predators when there is light, it is hard for the prey to detect predators at night, which leads to a delayed response to the attack. There is a mechano-sensory system in fishes to identify the different flow generated by different motion surrounding the water and between the bodies called as lateral line system. After detecting a predator, a larva evades its strike by &#x27;fast start&#x27; or &#x27;C&#x27; response. A swimming fish disturbs a volume of water ahead of its body with a flow velocity that increases with the proximity to the body. This particular phenomenon is sometimes called a bow wave. The timing of the &#x27;C&#x27; start response affects escape probability inversely. Escape probability increases with the distance from the predator at the time of strike. In general, prey successfully evade a predator strike from an intermediate distance (3–6 mm) from the predator. 

===Behavior===

Objective quantification is complicated in higher vertebrates by the complex and diverse locomotor repertoire and neural system. However, the relative simplicity of a juvenile brain and simple nervous system of fishes with fundamental neuronal pathways allows zebrafish larvae to be an apt model to study the interconnection between locomotor repertoire and neuronal system of a vertebrate. Behavior represents the unique interface between intrinsic and extrinsic forces that determine an organism&#x27;s health and survival. Larval zebrafish perform many locomotor behavior such as escape response, prey tracking, optomotor response etc. These behaviors can be categorized with respect to body position as ‘C’-starts, ‘J’-turns, slow scoots, routine turns etc. Fish larvae respond to abrupt changes in illumination with distinct locomotor behavior. The larvae show high locomotor activity during periods of bright light compared to dark. This behavior can direct towards the idea of searching food in light whereas the larvae do not feed in dark. Also light exposure directly manipulates the locomotor activities of larvae throughout circadian period of light and dark with higher locomotor activity in light condition than in dark condition which is very similar as seen in mammals. Following the onset of darkness, larvae shows hyperactive scoot motion prior to a gradual drop off. This behavior could possibly be linked to find a shelter before nightfall. Also larvae can treat this sudden nightfall as under debris and the hyperactivity can be explained as the larvae navigation back to illuminated areas. Prolonged dark period can reduce the light-dark responsiveness of larvae. Following light extinction, larvae execute large angle turns towards the vanished light source, which explains the navigational response of a larva. Acute ethanol exposure reduce visual sensitivity of larvae causing a latency to respond in light and dark period change.

<doc id="1284762" wikidata="Q654400" url="?curid=1284762" title="Fischer–Tropsch process">
<text>The Fischer–Tropsch process (FT) is a collection of chemical reactions that converts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, known as syngas, into liquid hydrocarbons. These reactions occur in the presence of metal catalysts, typically at temperatures of and pressures of one to several tens of atmospheres. The Fischer–Tropsch process is an important reaction in both coal liquefaction and gas to liquids technology for producing liquid hydrocarbons.

In the usual implementation, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the feedstocks for FT, are produced from coal, natural gas, or biomass in a process known as gasification. The process then converts these gases into synthetic lubrication oil and synthetic fuel. This process has received intermittent attention as a source of low-sulfur diesel fuel and to address the supply or cost of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons. Fischer–Tropsch process is discussed as a step of producing carbon-neutral liquid hydrocarbon fuels from CO2 and hydrogen.

The process was first developed by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Coal Research in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany, in 1925.

==Reaction mechanism==

The Fischer–Tropsch process involves a series of chemical reactions that produce a variety of hydrocarbons, ideally having the formula (C&quot;n&quot;H2&quot;n&quot;+2). The more useful reactions produce alkanes as follows:

: (2&quot;n&quot; + 1) H2 + &quot;n&quot; CO → C&quot;n&quot;H2&quot;n&quot;+2 + &quot;n&quot; H2O

where &quot;n&quot; is typically 10–20. The formation of methane (&quot;n&quot; = 1) is unwanted. Most of the alkanes produced tend to be straight-chain, suitable as diesel fuel. In addition to alkane formation, competing reactions give small amounts of alkenes, as well as alcohols and other oxygenated hydrocarbons.

The reaction is a highly exothermic reaction due to a standard reaction enthalpy (ΔH) of −165 kJ/mol CO combined.

===Fischer–Tropsch intermediates and elemental reactions===
Converting a mixture of H2 and CO into aliphatic products is a multi-step reaction with several intermediate compounds. The growth of the hydrocarbon chain may be visualized as involving a repeated sequence in which hydrogen atoms are added to carbon and oxygen, the C–O bond is split and a new C–C bond is formed.
For one –CH2– group produced by CO + 2 H2 → (CH2) + H2O, several reactions are necessary:
* Associative adsorption of CO
* Splitting of the C–O bond
* Dissociative adsorption of 2 H2
* Transfer of 2 H to the oxygen to yield H2O
* Desorption of H2O
* Transfer of 2 H to the carbon to yield CH2

The conversion of CO to alkanes involves hydrogenation of CO, the hydrogenolysis (cleavage with H2) of C–O bonds, and the formation of C–C bonds. Such reactions are assumed to proceed via initial formation of surface-bound metal carbonyls. The CO ligand is speculated to undergo dissociation, possibly into oxide and carbide ligands. Other potential intermediates are various C1 fragments including formyl (CHO), hydroxycarbene (HCOH), hydroxymethyl (CH2OH), methyl (CH3), methylene (CH2), methylidyne (CH), and hydroxymethylidyne (COH). Furthermore, and critical to the production of liquid fuels, are reactions that form C–C bonds, such as migratory insertion. Many related stoichiometric reactions have been simulated on discrete metal clusters, but homogeneous Fischer–Tropsch catalysts are of no commercial importance.

Addition of isotopically labelled alcohol to the feed stream results in incorporation of alcohols into product. This observation establishes the facility of C–O bond scission. Using 14C-labelled ethylene and propene over cobalt catalysts results in incorporation of these olefins into the growing chain. Chain growth reaction thus appears to involve both &#x27;olefin insertion&#x27; as well as &#x27;CO-insertion&#x27;.

:&lt;chem&gt;8 CO + 17 H2 -&gt; C8H18 + 8 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

==Feedstocks: gasification==
Fischer–Tropsch plants associated with biomass or coal or related solid feedstocks (sources of carbon) must first convert the solid fuel into gases. These gases include CO, H2, and alkanes. This conversion is called gasification. Synthesis gas (&quot;syngas&quot;) is obtained from biomass/coal gasification is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The H2:CO ratio is adjusted using the water-gas shift reaction. Coal-based FT plants produce varying amounts of CO2, depending upon the energy source of the gasification process. However, most coal-based plants rely on the feed coal to supply all the energy requirements of the process.

===Feedstocks: GTL===
Carbon monoxide for FT catalysis is derived from hydrocarbons. In gas to liquids (GTL) technology, the hydrocarbons are low molecular weight materials that often would be discarded or flared. Stranded gas provides relatively cheap gas. For GTL to be commercially viable, gas must remain relatively cheaper than oil.

Several reactions are required to obtain the gaseous reactants required for FT catalysis. First, reactant gases entering a reactor must be desulfurized. Otherwise, sulfur-containing impurities deactivate (&quot;poison&quot;) the catalysts required for FT reactions.

Several reactions are employed to adjust the H2:CO ratio. Most important is the water-gas shift reaction, which provides a source of hydrogen at the expense of carbon monoxide:
:&lt;chem&gt;H2O + CO -&gt; H2 + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;
For FT plants that use methane as the feedstock, another important reaction is dry reforming, which converts the methane into CO and H2:
: &lt;chem&gt;CH4 + CO2 -&gt; 2CO + 2H2&lt;/chem&gt;

===Process conditions===
Generally, the Fischer–Tropsch process is operated in the temperature range of . Higher temperatures lead to faster reactions and higher conversion rates but also tend to favor methane production. For this reason, the temperature is usually maintained at the low to middle part of the range. Increasing the pressure leads to higher conversion rates and also favors the formation of long-chained alkanes, both of which are desirable. Typical pressures range from one to several tens of atmospheres. Even higher pressures would be favorable, but the benefits may not justify the additional costs of high-pressure equipment, and higher pressures can lead to catalyst deactivation via coke formation.

A variety of synthesis-gas compositions can be used. For cobalt-based catalysts the optimal H2:CO ratio is around 1.8–2.1. Iron-based catalysts can tolerate lower ratios, due to the intrinsic water-gas shift reaction activity of the iron catalyst. This reactivity can be important for synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass, which tend to have relatively low H2:CO ratios (&lt; 1).

=== Design of the Fischer–Tropsch process reactor ===
Efficient removal of heat from the reactor is the basic need of FT reactors since these reactions are characterized by high exothermicity. Four types of reactors are discussed:

====Multi tubular fixed-bed reactor====

: This type of reactor contains several tubes with small diameters. These tubes contain catalysts and are surrounded by cooling water which removes the heat of the reaction. A fixed-bed reactor is suitable for operation at low temperatures and has an upper-temperature limit of 257 °C (530 K). Excess temperature leads to carbon deposition and hence blockage of the reactor. Since large amounts of the products formed are in liquid state, this type of reactor can also be referred to as a trickle flow reactor system.

====Entrained flow reactor====
:This type of reactor contains two banks of heat exchangers which remove heat; the remainder of which is removed by the products and recycled in the system. The formation of heavy waxes should be avoided, since they condense on the catalyst and form agglomerations. This leads to fluidization. Hence, risers are operated over 297 °C (570 K).

====Slurry reactors====
:Heat removal is done by internal cooling coils. The synthesis gas is bubbled through the waxy products and finely-divided catalyst which is suspended in the liquid medium. This also provides agitation of the contents of the reactor. The catalyst particle size reduces diffusional heat and mass transfer limitations. A lower temperature in the reactor leads to a more viscous product and a higher temperature (&gt; 297 °C, 570 K) gives an undesirable product spectrum. Also, separation of the product from the catalyst is a problem.

====Fluid-bed and circulating catalyst (riser) reactors====
:These are used for high-temperature FT synthesis (nearly 340 °C) to produce low-molecular-weight unsaturated hydrocarbons on alkalized fused iron catalysts. The fluid-bed technology (as adapted from the catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum distillates) was introduced by Hydrocarbon Research in 1946–50 and named the &#x27;Hydrocol&#x27; process. A large scale Fischer–Tropsch Hydrocol plant (350,000 tons per annum) operated during 1951–57 in Brownsville, Texas. Due to technical problems, and impractical economics due to increasing petroleum availability, this development was discontinued. Fluid-bed FT synthesis has been reinvestigated by Sasol. One reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is in operation. The process has been used for C2 and C7 alkene production. A high-temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst (&#x27;circulating fluid bed&#x27;, &#x27;riser reactor&#x27;, &#x27;entrained catalyst process&#x27;) was introduced by the Kellogg Company and a respective plant built at Sasol in 1956. It was improved by Sasol for successful operation. At Secunda, South Africa, Sasol operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each. The circulating catalyst process can be replaced by fluid-bed technology. Early experiments with cobalt catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by Fischer. The bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a CO-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by Kölbel at the Rheinpreuben Company in 1953. Since 1990, low-temperature FT slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts, particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wax, or to be hydrocracked and isomerized to produce diesel fuel, by Exxon and Sasol. Slurry-phase (bubble column) low-temperature FT synthesis is efficient. This technology is also under development by the Statoil Company (Norway) for use on a vessel to convert associated gas at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid.

===Product distribution===
In general the product distribution of hydrocarbons formed during the Fischer–Tropsch process follows an Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution, which can be expressed as:

: = (1 − &quot;α&quot;)2&quot;α&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1

where &quot;W&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the weight fraction of hydrocarbons containing &quot;n&quot; carbon atoms, and &quot;α&quot; is the chain growth probability or the probability that a molecule will continue reacting to form a longer chain. In general, α is largely determined by the catalyst and the specific process conditions.

Examination of the above equation reveals that methane will always be the largest single product so long as &quot;α&quot; is less than 0.5; however, by increasing &quot;α&quot; close to one, the total amount of methane formed can be minimized compared to the sum of all of the various long-chained products. Increasing &quot;α&quot; increases the formation of long-chained hydrocarbons. The very long-chained hydrocarbons are waxes, which are solid at room temperature. Therefore, for production of liquid transportation fuels it may be necessary to crack some of the FT products. In order to avoid this, some researchers have proposed using zeolites or other catalyst substrates with fixed sized pores that can restrict the formation of hydrocarbons longer than some characteristic size (usually &quot;n&quot; &lt; 10). This way they can drive the reaction so as to minimize methane formation without producing many long-chained hydrocarbons. Such efforts have had only limited success.

==Catalysts==

Four metals are active as catalysts for the Fischer–Tropsch process: iron, cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium. Since FT process typically transforms inexpensive precursors into complex mixtures that require further refining, FT catalysts are based on inexpensive metals, especially iron and cobalt. Nickel generates too much methane, so it is not used.

Typically, such heterogeneous catalysts are obtained through precipitation from iron nitrate solutions. Such solutions can be used to deposit the metal salt onto the catalyst support (see below). Such treated materials transform into active catalysts by heating under CO, H2 or with the feedstock to be treated, i.e., the catalysts are generated in situ. Owing to the multistep nature of the FT process, analysis of the catalytically active species is challenging. Furthermore, as is known for iron catalysts, a number of phases may coexist and may participate in diverse steps in the reaction. Such phases include various oxides and carbides as well as polymorphs of the metals. Control of these constituents may be relevant to product distributions. Aside from iron and cobalt, nickel and ruthenium are active for converting the CO/H2 mixture to hydrocarbons. Although expensive, ruthenium is the most active of the Fischer–Tropsch catalysts in the sense that It works at the lowest reaction temperatures and produces higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. Ruthenium catalysts consist of the metal, without any promoters, thus providing relatively simple system suitable for mechanistic analysis. Its high price preclude industrial applications. Cobalt catalysts are more active for FT synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas. Natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio, so the water-gas shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts. Cobalt-based catalysts are more sensitive than their iron counterparts.

Illustrative of real world catalyst selection, high-temperature Fischer–Tropsch (HTFT), which operates at 330–350 °C, uses an iron-based catalyst. This process was used extensively by Sasol in their coal-to-liquid plants (CTL). Low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch (LTFT) uses an iron- or cobalt-based catalyst. This process is best known for being used in the first integrated GTL-plant operated and built by Shell in Bintulu, Malaysia.

===Promoters and supports===
In addition to the active metal (usually Fe or Co), two other components comprise the catalyst: promoters and the catalyst support. Promoters are additives that enhance the behavior of the catalyst. For F-T catalysts, typical promoters including potassium and copper, which are usually added as salts. The choice of promoters depends on the primary metal, iron vs cobalt. Iron catalysts need alkali promotion to attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% ). Potassium-doped α-Fe2O3 are synthesized under variable calcination temperatures (400–800 °C). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , for structural promotion and maybe some manganese can be applied for selectivity control (e.g. high olefinicity). The choice of promoters depends on the primary metal, i.e., iron vs cobalt. While group 1 alkali metals (e.g., potassium), help iron catalysts, they poison cobalt catalysts.

Catalysts are supported on high-surface-area binders/supports such as silica, alumina, or zeolites.
==History==

The F-T process attracted attention as a means of Nazi Germany to produce liquid hydrocarbons. The original process was developed by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch, working at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut for Chemistry in 1926. They filed a number of patents, &quot;e.g.&quot;, , applied 1926, published 1930. It was commercialized by Brabag in Germany in 1936. Being petroleum-poor but coal-rich, Germany used the process during World War II to produce &quot;ersatz&quot; (replacement) fuels. FT production accounted for an estimated 9% of German war production of fuels and 25% of the automobile fuel. Many refinements and adjustments have been made to the process since Fischer and Tropsch&#x27;s time.

The United States Bureau of Mines, in a program initiated by the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act, employed seven Operation Paperclip synthetic fuel scientists in a Fischer–Tropsch plant in Louisiana, Missouri in 1946.

In Britain, Alfred August Aicher obtained several patents for improvements to the process in the 1930s and 1940s. Aicher&#x27;s company was named &quot;Synthetic Oils Ltd&quot; (not related to a company of the same name in Canada).

Around the 1930s and 1940s, Arthur Imhausen developed and implemented an industrial process for producing edible fats from these synthetic oils through oxidation. The products were fractionally distilled and the edible fats were obtained from the - fraction which were reacted with glycerol such as that synthesized from propylene. &quot;Coal butter&quot; margarine made from synthetic oils was found to be nutritious and of agreeable taste, and it was incorporated into diets contributing as much as 700 calories per day. The process required at least 60 kg of coal per kg of synthetic butter.

==Commercialization==
===Uzbekistan GTL===
===Ras Laffan, Qatar===

The LTFT facility Pearl GTL at Ras Laffan, Qatar, is the second largest FT plant in the world after Sasol&#x27;s Secunda plant in South Africa. It uses cobalt catalysts at 230 °C, converting natural gas to petroleum liquids at a rate of , with additional production of of oil equivalent in natural gas liquids and ethane.

Another plant in Ras Laffan, called Oryx GTL, has been commissioned in 2007 with a capacity of . The plant utilizes the Sasol slurry phase distillate process, which uses a cobalt catalyst. Oryx GTL is a joint venture between QatarEnergy and Sasol.

===Sasol===
The world&#x27;s largest scale implementation of Fischer–Tropsch technology is a series of plants operated by Sasol in South Africa, a country with large coal reserves, but little oil. With a capacity of 165000 Bpd at its Secunda CTL plant. The first commercial plant opened in 1952. Sasol uses coal and natural gas as feedstocks and produces a variety of synthetic petroleum products, including most of the country&#x27;s diesel fuel.

===PetroSA===
PetroSA, another South African company, operates a refinery with a 36,000 barrels a day plant that completed semi-commercial demonstration in 2011, paving the way to begin commercial preparation. The technology can be used to convert natural gas, biomass or coal into synthetic fuels.

===Shell middle distillate synthesis===
One of the largest implementations of Fischer–Tropsch technology is in Bintulu, Malaysia. This Shell facility converts natural gas into low-sulfur Diesel fuels and food-grade wax. The scale is .

===Velocys===
Construction is underway for Velocys&#x27; commercial reference plant incorporating its microchannel Fischer–Tropsch technology; ENVIA Energy&#x27;s Oklahoma City GTL project being built adjacent to Waste Management&#x27;s East Oak landfill site. The project is being financed by a joint venture between Waste Management, NRG Energy, Ventech and Velocys. The feedstock for this plant will be a combination of landfill gas and pipeline natural gas.

===SGCE===
Starting as a biomass technology licensor In Summer of 2012 SGC Energia (SGCE) successfully commissioned a pilot multi tubular Fischer–Tropsch process unit and associated product upgrading units at the Pasadena, Tx Technology Center. The technology center focused on the development and operations of their XTLH solution which optimized processing of low value carbon waste streams into advanced fuels and wax products. This unit also serves as an operations training environment for the 1100 BPD Juniper GTL facility constructed in Westlake LA.

===UPM (Finland)===
In October 2006, Finnish paper and pulp manufacturer UPM announced its plans to produce biodiesel by the Fischer–Tropsch process alongside the manufacturing processes at its European paper and pulp plants, using waste biomass resulting from paper and pulp manufacturing processes as source material.

===Arcadia eFuels===
Texas based Arcadia eFuels in conjunction with Sasol and Topsoe is constructing a sustainable aviation fuel plant in Vordingborg, Denmark that will use Fischer-Tropsch process to convert syngas derived from water electrolysis and carbon capture into an e-diesel fuel for aviation. The plant will begin production in 2028 with additional plants in development in Teesside, United Kingdom and the United States.

===Rentech===
A demonstration-scale Fischer–Tropsch plant was built and operated by Rentech, Inc., in partnership with ClearFuels, a company specializing in biomass gasification. Located in Commerce City CO, the facility produces about of fuels from natural gas. Commercial-scale facilities were planned for Rialto, California; Natchez, Mississippi; Port St. Joe, Florida; and White River, Ontario. Rentech closed down their pilot plant in 2013, and abandoned work on their FT process as well as the proposed commercial facilities.

=== INFRA GTL Technology ===

In 2010, INFRA built a compact Pilot Plant for conversion of natural gas into synthetic oil. The plant modeled the full cycle of the GTL chemical process including the intake of pipeline gas, sulfur removal, steam methane reforming, syngas conditioning, and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. In 2013 the first pilot plant was acquired by VNIIGAZ Gazprom LLC. In 2014 INFRA commissioned and operated on a continuous basis a new, larger scale full cycle Pilot Plant. It represents the second generation of INFRA&#x27;s testing facility and is differentiated by a high degree of automation and extensive data gathering system. In 2015, INFRA built its own catalyst factory in Troitsk (Moscow, Russia). The catalyst factory has a capacity of over 15 tons per year, and produces the unique proprietary Fischer–Tropsch catalysts developed by the company&#x27;s R&amp;D division. In 2016, INFRA designed and built a modular, transportable GTL (gas-to-liquid) M100 plant for processing natural and associated gas into synthetic crude oil in Wharton TX. The M100 plant is operating as a technology demonstration unit, R&amp;D platform for catalyst refinement, and economic model to scale the Infra GTL process into larger and more efficient plants.

===Other===
In the United States and India, some coal-producing states have invested in Fischer–Tropsch plants. In Pennsylvania, Waste Management and Processors, Inc. was funded by the state to implement FT technology licensed from Shell and Sasol to convert so-called waste coal (leftovers from the mining process) into low-sulfur diesel fuel.

==Research developments==
Choren Industries has built a plant in Germany that converts biomass to syngas and fuels using the Shell FT process structure. The company went bankrupt in 2011 due to impracticalities in the process.

Biomass gasification (BG) and Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis can in principle be combined to produce renewable transportation fuels (biofuels).

In partnership with Sunfire, Audi produces E-diesel in small scale with two steps, the second one being FT.

===U.S. Air Force certification===
Syntroleum, a publicly traded United States company, has produced over of diesel and jet fuel from the Fischer–Tropsch process using natural gas and coal at its demonstration plant near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Syntroleum is working to commercialize its licensed Fischer–Tropsch technology via coal-to-liquid plants in the United States, China, and Germany, as well as gas-to-liquid plants internationally. Using natural gas as a feedstock, the ultra-clean, low sulfur fuel has been tested extensively by the United States Department of Energy and the United States Department of Transportation. Syntroleum has worked to develop a synthetic jet fuel blend that will help the Air Force to reduce its dependence on imported petroleum. The Air Force, which is the United States military&#x27;s largest user of fuel, began exploring alternative fuel sources in 1999. On December 15, 2006, a B-52 took off from Edwards Air Force Base, California for the first time powered solely by a 50–50 blend of JP-8 and Syntroleum&#x27;s FT fuel. The seven-hour flight test was considered a success. The goal of the flight test program is to qualify the fuel blend for fleet use on the service&#x27;s B-52s, and then flight test and qualification on other aircraft. The test program concluded in 2007. This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative, an effort to develop secure domestic sources for the military energy needs. The Pentagon hopes to reduce its use of crude oil from foreign producers and obtain about half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016.

===Carbon dioxide reuse===
Carbon dioxide is not a typical feedstock for FT catalysis. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide react over a cobalt-based catalyst, producing methane. With iron-based catalysts unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons are also produced. Upon introduction to the catalyst&#x27;s support, ceria functions as a reverse water-gas shift catalyst, further increasing the yield of the reaction. The short-chain hydrocarbons were upgraded to liquid fuels over solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites.

== Process efficiency ==
Using conventional FT technology the process ranges in carbon efficiency from 25 to 50 percent and a thermal efficiency of about 50% for CTL facilities idealised at 60% with GTL facilities at about 60% efficiency idealised to 80% efficiency.

==Fischer–Tropsch in nature==
A Fischer–Tropsch-type process has also been suggested to have produced a few of the building blocks of DNA and RNA within asteroids. Similarly, the hypothetical abiogenic petroleum formation requires some naturally occurring FT-like processes.

Biological Fischer-Tropsch-type chemistry can be carried out by the enzyme nitrogenase at ambient conditions.

<doc id="1284764" wikidata="Q6941969" url="?curid=1284764" title="Music in the Tuva Republic">
<text>Tuva is a part of Russia, inhabited by a Turkic people. Tuvans are known abroad for &quot;khoomei&quot; (&quot;xöömej&quot;), a kind of overtone singing.

Traditionally, Tuvan music was only a solo effort. The musician&#x27;s intention was usually to emphasise timbre and harmonics over rhythm. Performances were often in places with good natural acoustics, such as caves, cliffs, and rivers, with the performer taking long pauses to allow nature the chance to converse back. Modern Tuvan music usually involves ensembles of musicians playing multiple instruments, and tends to be more pulsatile than traditional forms.

==Traditional songs==
Tuvans&#x27; belief in spirits is apparent in their musical practices. Praise songs and chants, called &quot;algysh&quot;, and the rhythmically chanted poetic couplets that precede breaths of throat-singing, address &quot;cher eezi&quot;, or local-spirit masters with words. Throat singing is instead made to imitate sounds produced by the places or beings in which the spirit-masters dwell. Singers establish contact with the spirit-master by reproducing the sounds made and enter into conversation, whose aim is supplication, an expression of gratitude, or an appeal for protection. The same imitative or mimetic interaction with the natural sound world may also be mediated through the use of traditional musical instruments. Calm, mimetic singing in reproduction of the sounds of a certain place is believed to be the best possible offering to spirit-masters.

This region is also famous for its indigenous shaman population. Shamans commonly created music in order to call upon spirits, conjure ancestors, discover birthplaces, connect with natural surroundings, and to attract spirits for hunters. Shepherds would also play music to herd animals and imitate galloping horses. Each song had a certain meaning according to where the musician was and whether or not the situation was work or relaxation.

Many traditional Tuvan songs share the same structure. They may consist of several verses, each four lines long, with each line having only eight syllables. It is not uncommon for all the lines of a verse to begin with a word starting with the same letter or a similar-sounding letter.

==Traditional instruments==
*Amyrga (horn used for hunting Maral)
*Byzaanchy (4-string spike fiddle)
*Chadagan (similar to a zither)
*Chanzy (3-string plucked lute)
**Bichii chanzy (small &quot;chanzy&quot; tuned one octave higher)
*Doshpuluur (3-string plucked lute)
*Dungur (flat drum used by shamans)
*Ediski (birch wood vibrated with the mouth to imitate birds)
*Igil (2-string bowed horsehead fiddle with skin-covered soundbox)
*Khomus (jaw harp)
*Shoor (end blown flute used by shamans to attract spirits)
*Yat-kha (long zither similar to Korean &quot;gayageum&quot;)
*Xapchyk (rattle made of a dried bull&#x27;s scrotum filled with the knuckle bones from sheep)
*Kengirge (large frame drum) and shyngyrash (bells that sit atop the kengirge)

==Modern music==
In parallel with traditional music, modern genres of music developed in Tuva since the 1970s. These were mainly pop and rock music, as well as fusions of these genres with khoomei. The most popular Tuvan musical group is Huun-Huur-Tu.

Notable Tuvan rock and fusion performers include: Saidash Mongush; Yat-Kha; Alexander Sarzhat-Ool (guitar), who spent 22 years in jail before starting the music career, and was self-taught; Alexander Chavynchak (guitar), who performed free jazz and blues, as well as khoomei; and Vladimir Oidupaa (bayan and khoomei).

Uniformed marching bands are active in the republic, particularly the Brass Band of the Government of Tuva. Created on 24 March 2008 from a student band under the Kyzyl Art College (originally founded in 1960), the average age of band members is 24 years old. It is the only civilian mounted band in Russia, reviving the traditions of its predecessor – the Horse Brass Band of the Tuva People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army, which was active in the TPRA from 1929 to 1944. The first performance of the band was on horseback during a Victory Day Parade in 2008 in Kyzyl. It also performed the following October for a program dedicated to the 65th anniversary of Tuva joining Russia. The band participates in many international and inter-regional festivals, including the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo and the Capital City Day celebrations in Kazakhstan, and is a three time winner of the Grand Prix of the International Festival of Live Music and Faith &quot;Ustuu-Khuree&quot;.

<text>Phranc (born Susan Gottlieb; August 28, 1957), is an American singer-songwriter whose career began playing in several bands in the late 1970s Los Angeles punk rock scene. Her musical style later shifted during the 1980s as a solo artist, into a self-proclaimed &quot;All-American Jewish lesbian folksinger.&quot;

==Biography==
Phranc was born Susan Gottlieb in Santa Monica, California, and grew up in Mar Vista, Los Angeles. She began her performing career in the late 1970s and early 1980s punk scene in Los Angeles. She had a bleached blonde crewcut and wore male attire, creating an androgynous persona for her first band, Nervous Gender, which formed in 1978. The writer V/D wrote of her for the punk fanzine &quot;Slash&quot;, &quot;On stage, Phranc looks like a 14-year-old runaway from a boys&#x27; reform school.&quot; The band was influential in the development of what later came to be known as &#x27;electropunk&#x27;. In 1980 she left Nervous Gender to join the punk band Catholic Discipline, in which Craig Lee (Bags) and Claude Bessy, journalist for &quot;Slash&quot; punk fanzine, were the lead singers. Phranc appears with Catholic Discipline in the 1980 documentary &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;. She was also in Castration Squad, a feminist, all-female punk band which also featured Dinah Cancer of 45 Grave, Elissa Bello of The Go-Go&#x27;s, Alice Bag of the Bags, Tracy Lea of Redd Kross, and Shannon Wilhelm.

In the 1980s, Phranc pursued a solo career. She performs in Paul Morrissey&#x27;s film &quot;Madame Wang&#x27;s&quot; (1981) as Phranque. She began playing an acoustic guitar and released &quot;Folksinger&quot; on Rhino Records in 1985. She opened for music acts such as The Smiths, Hüsker Dü, Violent Femmes, and Billy Bragg. She styled herself the &quot;All-American Jewish Lesbian Folksinger&quot; and with a wry sense of humour released the LP &quot;I Enjoy Being a Girl&quot; in 1989 on Island Records, appearing on the cover with her trademark &#x27;flat top&#x27; hair style. Describing a live performance, Adam Block wrote &quot;Phranc&#x27;s unnerving androgyny (expressed with easy confidence) and her fervent opinions (couched in sly, laconic wit) make her a fascinating performer.&quot; Her third full-length recording, released in 1991, was &quot;Positively Phranc&quot;.

Phranc was an important influence on the Queercore movement, being acknowledged as such by Team Dresch in their song for her, &quot;Uncle Phranc.&quot; In the 1990s many queercore bands and musicians involved in queercore music began collaborating with her. She appeared as a guest on the Team Dresch LP/CD &quot;Captain My Captain&quot; and, as well, members of Team Dresch, Tobi Vail of Bikini Kill, Patty Schemel of Hole and others have played with Phranc on her EP &quot;Goofyfoot&quot; and other songs. Phranc performs and is interviewed in the queercore documentary &quot;She&#x27;s Real, Worse Than Queer&quot; by Lucy Thane, and she has appeared frequently at queercore events such as Olympia&#x27;s &quot;Homo-a-go-go&quot; festival. In the 1990s Phranc performed &quot;Hot August Phranc&quot;, performing as Neil Diamond. On her full-length CD of 1998, &quot;Milkman&quot;, she is joined by Steve MacDonald of Redd Kross, who plays bass. Her most recent releases, including &quot;Milkman&quot;, appear on her own independent record label, Phancy Records.

The 2001 documentary film, &quot;Lifetime Guarantee&quot;, directed by Lisa Udelson, chronicled Phranc&#x27;s side job as a Tupperware demonstrator and manager. The documentary showed that despite Phranc&#x27;s high sales and high-profile, her enthusiastic and sincere approach to the job, and her engaging manner and popularity among the sales force, Phranc was disappointed to find that the Tupperware corporation itself did not celebrate or even acknowledge her genuine achievements in sales and marketing for the company. Phranc was still selling Tupperware in 2008, but as of 2013 her online store was closed.

She still performs occasionally, but spends more time working on creative visual art projects, including her Cardboard Cobbler sculptures. In December 2007 she had a solo art show at Cue Art Foundation in New York City curated by Ann Magnuson; &quot;The New York Times&quot; review compared her work to Claes Oldenburg and Andy Warhol. Phranc had her first major West Coast solo show, at Craig Krull Gallery, June 18 to July 23, 2011, an exhibition made of beach themed cardboard and craft paper works. She continues to work in her Santa Monica studio and is represented by Krull.

Phranc was absent from her blog and Facebook from late 2011 to Spring 2014. Phranc announced in April 2014 that she had been prevented from participating in online activities due to an injury.

In 2023 Phranc&#x27;s retrospective The Butch Closet was held at Craig Krull Gallery in Santa Monica. It was a multi-disciplinary show that included new and old work as well as ephemera, home movies, merchandise and artfacts from her music and visual art career spanning over 40 years. It included pieces like drawings of food, vacuums, and toothpaste that Phranc did while working at the Women&#x27;s Building in the 1970s, as well as current work like a reproduction of her &quot;Slash&quot; magazine t-shirt and her 1960s Lambchop Halloween costume.

<doc id="1284768" wikidata="Q16997198" url="?curid=1284768" title="List of Maid Marian and Her Merry Men episodes">
<text>The following is a list of the episodes of the BBC television series &quot;Maid Marian and her Merry Men&quot;.

== Series 1 (1989) ==
Series One is the most faithful to the original legends being parodied and probably the series with the fewest anachronisms. Originally transmitted from 16 November to 21 December 1989, with How The Band Got Together repeated on 20 April 2001.

== Series 2 (1990) ==
Series Two, despite the appearance of Guy of Gisborne (who is almost the opposite of the character of the same name from the legends) begins to veer away from them and instead move towards a more creative style. Originally transmitted from 15 November to 20 December 1990, and repeated from 27 April to 1 June 2001.

== Series 3 (1993) ==
By the third series, the surrealism and anachronisms were well-entrenched and the plots had very little to do with the historical setting. More overt parodies and references can be seen here, including the song in Episode 3 &quot;Call The Dentist&quot; (a direct parody of the Ghostbusters theme), &quot;Chop Suey&quot; in Episode 5 (a slow parody of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;) and almost all of Episode 5. The supposed conflict between King John and the Sheriff on the one side and the Merry Men on the other is often downplayed in favour of a general comedic situation. Originally transmitted from 7 January to 11 February 1993, and repeated from 8 June to 13 July 2001.

== Christmas Special (1993) ==
Originally transmitted as one 50 minute episode on 24 December 1993, and repeated as two 25 minute episodes on 20 July and 27 July 2001. This episode can be found as an extra on the series 3 DVD release.

== Series 4 (1994) ==
This, the final series of the programme, is in many ways the most bizarre. On the one hand, the comedy became more sophisticated: the roleplaying references in Episode 1, the parodies of English seaside culture in Episode 3 and the Beatles references in Episode 4 are jokes aimed over the heads of a juvenile audience. The appearance of &quot;Clem Costner&quot; is a reference to the Robin Hood films – and the fact that the Costner character is Robin&#x27;s antithesis is perhaps unsurprising – while the inversion of the entire culture in the final episode demonstrates that nothing is sacred. On the other hand, the comedy also became more juvenile, and there was more slapstick and pie gags than in the other three series combined. Originally transmitted from 5 January to 16 February 1994, with five of the seven episodes repeated (The Wise Woman of Worksop and Voyage to the Bottom of the Forest were not included) from 3 to 31 August 2001.

<doc id="1284775" wikidata="Q4664138" url="?curid=1284775" title="Abbie G. Rogers">
<text>Abigail Gifford Rogers (January 20, 1841 – May 21, 1894) was the first wife of Henry Huttleston Rogers (1840–1909), an American business magnate.

As children, Abbie and Henry grew up and went to school together in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, a small coastal fishing town with a whaling heritage. They were married in 1862, and started their family life together in a one-room shack in the newly discovered western Pennsylvania oil fields. Although he and Abbie lived frugally for many years, by 1875, Henry Rogers had risen in the petroleum industry to become one of the key men in John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust. He invested heavily in various industries, including copper, steel, mining, and railways. The Virginian Railway is widely considered his final life&#x27;s achievement. Rogers amassed a great fortune, estimated at over $100 million, and became one of the wealthiest men in the United States.

Abbie and Henry Rogers were generous, providing many public works for their hometown of Fairhaven, including the Town Hall which Abbie donated in 1894 shortly before her death. Rogers also financially assisted such notables as Mark Twain, Helen Keller, and Booker T. Washington.

Abbie and Henry Rogers had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood. She died suddenly on May 21, 1894, following an operation in New York City. After her death, Henry Rogers is said to have immersed himself even more in his work during the 15 years he outlived her. When he died in 1909, he was interred with her at Riverside Cemetery in Fairhaven.

== Childhood in Fairhaven, Massachusetts==
Abigail Palmer Gifford was the younger daughter of Captain Peleg W. Gifford and his wife, Amelia L. Hammond. Abbie&#x27;s father had been a whaling ship captain and participated in the &quot;Great Stone Fleet&quot; of scuttled ships that blockaded Charleston Harbor during the American Civil War. It is said that Captain Gifford loved to discuss his career as a very successful ship-master. The Giffords&#x27; home, built in 1835, was located at 36 Green Street in Fairhaven, (now numbered 115 Green Street).

As Abbie grew up, one of her schoolmates and neighbors in the small coastal town was young Henry Huttleston Rogers, nicknamed &quot;Hen&quot;, her future husband. Both Abbie and Henry were descendants of colonists who had arrived at the Plymouth Colony on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620.

There, in 1862, Abbie Palmer Gifford married young Henry Rogers, her childhood sweetheart. She returned with him to the oil fields where they lived in a one-room shack along Oil Creek, where her young husband and Ellis worked the Wamsutta Oil Refinery.

After 1874, the Rogers family continued to live in New York City, but vacationed at Fairhaven, where a large mansion was erected for them.

== Family and children ==
Abbie was the mother of five children, four girls and a boy. Another little son had died at birth. Their eldest daughter, Anne Engle Rogers, was born in 1865 in Pennsylvania.

The family moved to New York in 1866. Daughter Cara Leland Rogers was born in Fairhaven in 1867, Millicent was born in 1873, followed by Mary (who became known as Mai) in 1875.

Their son, Henry Huttleston Rogers Jr., was born in 1879, and came to be known as Harry. In adulthood, after the death of his father, he became known as Colonel Henry Huddleston Rogers, apparently returning to an earlier spelling of his middle name. The title of Colonel was apparently honorific, not uncommon in those times.

Local historians recall that the children of Henry Huttleston Rogers and Abbie Gifford Rogers were far more than vacationers in Fairhaven. Their roots were deep in the community. They spent time with grandparents and family friends, and became knowledgeable about the traditions of the old whaling town.

=== Anne Engle Rogers Benjamin ===
Anne married William Evarts Benjamin, a prominent Boston publisher and collector. They had 2 children, Beatrice Benjamin Cartwright and Henry Rogers Benjamin.

=== Cara Leland Rogers Broughton, Lady Fairhaven ===
In 1890, Cara Leland Rogers married Bradford Ferris Duff of New York. Their marriage was to end a year later, in 1891, when her new husband, aged twenty-four, died of a lung ailment at the Rogers&#x27; Fairhaven residence, making Cara a widow at twenty-three.

In the 1890s, Cara&#x27;s father had begun to consider a sewer and water project for the Fairhaven community. After much consultation with experts, he had chosen to adopt a sewerage plan developed in England known as the &quot;Shone Sewer System&quot;. To manage the project, a young English engineer, Urban Hanlon Broughton, was sent to town by the Shone executives to explain procedure and direct the actual work.

During his stay, Cara Duff had become acquainted with the young Englishman. By 1895, the sewer work was well on the way to completion, and Cara Rogers Duff and Urban Broughton had decided to be married. Cara became Mrs. Urban Broughton in late 1895. Departing on Christmas Day, they sailed across the Atlantic Ocean on a honeymoon trip to Europe.

The Broughtons&#x27; first child, a son, was born in Fairhaven in 1896, and was named Urban Huttleston Broughton. A second son was born in 1900, and was called Henry Rogers Broughton.

Although Urban Broughton was by birth an English subject, he spent more than twenty-five years in America, many of them in Chicago, Illinois. Urban Broughton became president of Utah Consolidated Mining Co. in 1901, and was chosen a director and a manager of the United Metals Selling Co., the selling agency for Amalgamated Copper. He was also a director of the Atlas Tack Co. in Fairhaven, the Santa Rica Mining Co., and the Butte Coalition Mining Co. in Montana.

After the sudden death of his father-in-law (Henry H. Rogers Sr.) in 1909, Urban Broughton became president of The Virginian Railway Company.

In 1912, Urban, Cara, and their two sons, Huttleston Broughton, and Henry Broughton, moved to England. They took up residence in Mayfair, London. Urban became a member of Parliament (MP). He found pleasure in this new career, becoming a close personal friend of Prime Minister Bonar Law. Cara devoted herself to family matters and other domestic duties. Their young sons soon became thoroughly-oriented British subjects.

During World War I, both Urban and Cara were very active in the war effort. Urban served the English government in many ways. He published a strong brochure designed to appeal to the good will of America entitled &quot;The British Empire at War&quot;.

Cara offered all her efforts to the good of her adopted country as well, sponsoring many types of war work. She was deeply interested in the well-being of Bethnal Green Military Hospital. She gave hospitable parties for wounded soldiers at the family home in Broadoaks, Byfleet.

During the 1920s, the Broughtons visited Fairhaven several times. In 1926, Cara purchased the revolutionary war site of Fort Phoenix and donated it to the city of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Today, it is a park.

Urban Broughton died in 1929, at the age of 72. Earlier in the same year, his name had been pending for elevation to the peerage by King George V. On May 2, 1929, the King proclaimed &quot;... Cara Leland Broughton, widow of Urban Hanlon Broughton, may henceforth enjoy the same style and title as if her husband...had survived and received the title and dignity of Baron Fairhaven&quot;.

The eldest son, Huttleston, was elevated to his father&#x27;s barony, and became the first Baron Fairhaven, and Cara, the first Lady Fairhaven.

=== Millicent Gifford Rogers ===
Millicent &quot;Millie&quot; Gifford Rogers was born in 1873. It is recorded that the child loved to draw sketches and read. She is to have once said on a visit to Fairhaven &quot;I wish we had a good library!&quot; However, in 1890 she died of heart failure at age 17.

The grieving Rogers family sought an appropriate means of memorializing her short life. Because she had been an avid reader, especially of poetry, the Rogers decided that they would build and donate to the town of Fairhaven a library named for her and given in the names of her sisters and brother.

In the same year she had died, land was acquired and plan were begun to erect in Fairhaven a unique and lavish tribute to the arts, the splendid yet functional Millicent Library. The cornerstone was laid in September, 1891 at a quiet morning ceremony with only the family and their clergyman, Rev. J.M. Leighton, in attendance. After prayer, Millie&#x27;s little brother, Harry, set the cornerstone. Within its confines were a sketch of Millicent, a tracing of the Rogers&#x27; ancestry, and a copy of the &quot;Fairhaven Star&quot; carrying a picture of the proposed building.

The Millicent Library describes the memorial window to the little girl who wished for a good library in Fairhaven as follows:

In the Library, just to the left of the main entrance, is a stunning stained-glass window made by Clayton and Bell of London. In the central panel is the figure of Erato, the Muse of Poetry, and her features bear a striking resemblance to those of the girl to whose memory the library was erected.

=== Mary Huttleston Rogers Coe ===
Mary Huttleston Rogers, known as &quot;Mai&quot;, was the youngest daughter, born in 1875 in Fairhaven. Mai was educated at private seminary schools, spoke fluent French, played the piano, and was interested in art and decoration.

After an earlier marriage which was unsuccessful (her father and family friend Mark Twain labeled her first husband a &quot;scalawag&quot;), on June 4, 1900, she married William Robertson Coe, a 30-year-old insurance company manager. Coe had met her during a transatlantic crossing. Between 1900 and 1910, the couple had four children: William Rogers Coe (1901–1971), Robert Douglas Coe (1902–1985), Henry Huttleston Rogers Coe (1907–1966), and Natalie Mai Coe Vitetti (1910–1987).

By 1910, Coe had become president of insurance broker Johnson &amp; Higgins, and he was involved in insuring the hull of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. Coe rose to become Chairman of the Board of Johnson and Higgins by 1916, a position he held until 1943.

Coe was on the Board of Directors of The Virginian Railway Company from 1910 until his death in 1955, and headed the company for a brief period during World War II. He was also a director of Loup Creek Colliery and the Wyoming Land Company.

Mai and her husband had a large estate, Planting Fields, built on the Gold Coast of Long Island, New York. They named the manor house &quot;Coe Hall&quot;. Mai and her husband shared a love of horticulture. Following an extended illness, Mai died in 1924, and was interred nearby. In 1949, their estate was donated by Coe to become Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park.

===Henry Huttleston Rogers Jr. ===
Henry Huttleston Rogers Jr. was born in 1879. He came to be known as Harry. He was the youngest of the Rogers children.

Harry became a favorite of Rogers family friend Mark Twain, who 
in 1897 dedicated his new book &quot;Following The Equator&quot; with the following quipping preface:

This Book Is Affectionately Inscribed To My Young Friend,

- HARRY ROGERS -

With recognition of what he is and apprehension of what he may become, unless he form himself a little more closely upon the model of - The Author

As a young adult, Harry often joined his father and family friends on trips aboard their luxury steam yacht &quot;Kanawha&quot;, built in 1899.

Harry married his first wife, Mary Benjamin. He and his wife traveled to Virginia with his father and Twain on the &quot;Kanawha&quot; in September, 1907 when the latter spoke at Robert Fulton Day at the Jamestown Exposition. After their 1929 divorce he married 2, Marguerite von Braun Savell Miles (married 1929-33) and 3, Pauline Van der Voort Dresser (married 1933).

Harry journeyed again with his father and Twain to Norfolk, Virginia, in April, 1909 for the dedication ceremonies and dinner to celebrate the completion of the Virginian Railway, which turned out to be his father&#x27;s final life achievement. After his father&#x27;s death the following month, Harry took over his father&#x27;s seat on the Board of Directors of the new railroad, with his brother-in-law, Urban Broughton, serving as the railroad&#x27;s President.

He assembled a valuable collection of model sailing ships, which were donated the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, after his death in 1935.

Harry and Mary Rogers had a son, Harry III, and a daughter, Millicent Rogers, a prominent socialite during the 1930s and 1940s whose vast collection of turquoise jewelry and Native American artifacts are housed in the Millicent Rogers Museum in Taos, New Mexico.

== 1894: A new Town Hall and tragedy ==
In 1894, Fairhaven received the gift of a new Town Hall from the Rogers Family. Abbie dedicated it to the memory of her mother. The following text about Abbie Rogers is from the Millicent Library, Fairhaven Massachusetts.

&quot;Mother of six children, Mrs. Rogers is represented as having been of a quiet and retiring disposition, completely devoid of the ostentation often associated with great wealth. Contemporary photographs attest to a shy and gentle charm of feature, and she is known to have cherished a deep affection for Fairhaven and a nostalgia for the simple ways of her childhood.

&quot;She was, therefore, delighted to become the donor of Fairhaven&#x27;s beautiful new &#x27;Town House,&#x27; and on February 22nd and 23d, 1894, she attended dedication exercises and received graciously at the splendid Dedication Ball, in the first gala functions marking the opening of the new building.

&quot;It was not given those attending these happy festivities to know that - but three months later - in May, 1894, this gentle woman was to die in New York City after an operation performed to save her life.&quot;

== Death==
Abbie Palmer Gifford Rogers died unexpectedly on May 21, 1894, age 53 in New York City. She had been undergoing an operation to remove a tumor. Her widower, Henry Rogers Sr., eventually remarried, but had no children with his second wife. Outliving her two days short of 15 years, after his death on May 19, 1909, he was interred beside her in Fairhaven&#x27;s Riverside Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The Town Hall in Fairhaven survives, as do many other gifts of the Rogers&#x27; family to Fairhaven, where she and her husband grew up. The home of Captain Peleg Gifford (Abbie&#x27;s childhood home), a two-story gable-end frame house built in the Greek Revival style at 36 Green Street, has been preserved. It and many other historic buildings in Fairhaven are opened periodically for special public tours.

The bronze plaque on the Fairhaven Town Hall, reads:

:&quot;This Building was presented to the Town of Fairhaven February 22, 1894, three months prior to the death of the donor Abbie Palmer Gifford Rogers. The people of Fairhaven in expressing their appreciation and gratitude for the gift would also record the sorrow they feel as a community through the loss of one whose life was full of good works. May this structure in its strength and beauty ever stand as commemorative of her character and thoughtful kindness.&quot;

<doc id="1284780" wikidata="Q5939380" url="?curid=1284780" title="Humanistic (album)">
<text>Humanistic is the debut album by Abandoned Pools. It was released in September 2001 through Extasy International. Though two songs were co-written by Pete Pagonis, the album is considered a solo work of Tommy Walter&#x27;s in which he used new material, as well as several songs he&#x27;d worked on beforehand in both Tely and Metromax, to compose, record, and release.

The album features a contrast of dark, gloomy, and sometimes aggressive songs such as &quot;The Remedy&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot; and more serene, upbeat tracks like &quot;Start Over&quot; and &quot;Sunny Day.&quot; Elements of industrial rock are evident in various ways; keyboard is used in light melody of the dark-lyric-themed &quot;Ruin Your Life&quot; as well as the raging chorus of &quot;Fluorescein,&quot; and ambiguous, non-sung vocal recordings are featured in various tracks. Synth effects are also utilized in various songs. Four tracks include backing vocals by Angie Hart of Frente!. Hart&#x27;s harmony style alongside Walter&#x27;s somewhat androgynous voice creates a unique vocal chemistry. This album was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge and Matt Silva, and was mastered by Gavin Lurssen.

==Touring and promotion==
While &quot;Humanistic&quot; was released in September 2001, the majority of promotion took place from early to mid-2002; indeed, the album and its singles did not begin to chart until March 2002 and commonly peaked around May. Leah Randi and Bryan Head filled out the ranks of bassist and drummer for the album&#x27;s tour support. They had several successful tours, going across the country and headlining with acts such as Garbage and Lenny Kravitz.

A music video was produced for the lead single, &quot;Mercy Kiss,&quot; and saw substantial airplay on MTV2. &quot;The Remedy&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot; were second and third video/single releases; however, the latter consisted of tour footage and was released long after the others via MTV&#x27;s website. &quot;Start Over&quot; was also included on the &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Van Wilder&quot; soundtrack in March 2002.

The group performed &quot;The Remedy&quot; on the June 5, 2002 edition of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and the June 26 edition of &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;. A large number of songs off &quot;Humanistic&quot; were also featured on the MTV animated series &quot;Clone High&quot; which debuted in November that year, with &quot;Start Over&quot; being the finale song of the show. However, after the series was dropped by MTV in February 2003, Abandoned Pools stopped touring (largely due to the dissolution of their label, Extasy Records).

==Reception==

The album received overall high praise upon release. Jason Thompson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; compared &quot;Humanistic&quot; to Billy Corgan&#x27;s solo work and noted it as much more successful. He went on to proclaim, &quot;&quot;Humanistic&quot; is a fantastic album that could be considered a masterpiece of electro-pop... Walter has a gift for creating dense pop confections that manage to float like a feather even with all of their heaviness.&quot; Often referring to the 31-year-old as a &quot;kid,&quot; Thom Jurek of AllMusic described Walter as a &quot;harder-rock version of Tommy Gnosis: vulnerable, lost, and wanting desperately to put it all into terms that are rock &amp; roll enough to make him stand out from the crowd.&quot;

<doc id="1284781" wikidata="Q244161" url="?curid=1284781" title="Phaedo">
<text>Phædo or Phaedo (; , &quot;Phaidōn&quot; ), also known to ancient readers as &quot;On The Soul&quot;, is one of the best-known dialogues of Plato&#x27;s middle period, along with the &quot;Republic&quot; and the &quot;Symposium.&quot; The philosophical subject of the dialogue is the immortality of the soul. It is set in the last hours prior to the death of Socrates, and is Plato&#x27;s fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher&#x27;s final days, following &quot;Euthyphro&quot;, &quot;Apology&quot;, and &quot;Crito&quot;.

One of the main themes in the &quot;Phaedo&quot; is the idea that the soul is immortal. In the dialogue, Socrates discusses the nature of the afterlife on his last day before being executed by drinking hemlock. Socrates has been imprisoned and sentenced to death by an Athenian jury for not believing in the gods of the state (though some scholars think it was more for his support of &quot;philosopher kings&quot; as opposed to democracy) and for corrupting the youth of the city.

By engaging in dialectic with a group of Socrates&#x27;s friends, including the two Thebans, Cebes, and Simmias, Socrates explores various arguments for the soul&#x27;s immortality in order to show that there is an afterlife in which the soul will dwell following death and, for couples and good people, be more at one with &quot;every loving thing&quot; and be more powerful than the Greek gods. Phaedo tells the story that following the discussion, he and the others were there to witness the death of Socrates.

The &quot;Phaedo&quot; was first translated into Latin from Greek by Apuleius but no copy survived, so Henry Aristippus produced a new translation in 1160.

==Summary==
The dialogue is told from the perspective of one of Socrates&#x27;s students, Phaedo of Elis, who was present at Socrates&#x27;s death bed. Phaedo relates the dialogue from that day to Echecrates, a Pythagorean philosopher.

Socrates offers four arguments for the soul&#x27;s immortality:

* The &quot;Cyclical Argument&quot;, or &quot;Opposites Argument&quot; explains that Forms are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily &quot;imperishable&quot;. As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite poles of magnets.

* The Recollection Argument, which is based on Plato&#x27;s famous &quot;theory of recollection,&quot; explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot;, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in &quot;Phaedo&quot;.

* The &quot;Affinity Argument&quot; explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.

* The &quot;Argument from Form of Life,&quot; or &quot;The Final Argument&quot; explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.
Some scholars have debated the accuracy of these names: for instance, David Ebrey has argued that the recollection argument should be titled &#x27;the recollecting argument&#x27; because &#x27;recollection&#x27; names the end-result of a process, whereas Plato is discussing the process of recollecting itself; he also has argued that the affinity argument should be called &#x27;the kinship argument&#x27; instead because the argument is based on learning about the soul&#x27;s nature from discussing its kin (i.e., the divine).

===Introductory conversation===
The scene is set in Phlius where Echecrates who, meeting Phaedo, asks for news about the last days of Socrates. Phaedo explains why a delay occurred between his trial and his death, and describes the scene in a prison at Athens on the final day, naming those present. He tells how he had visited Socrates early in the morning with the others. Socrates&#x27;s wife Xanthippe was there, but was very distressed and Socrates asked that she be taken away. Socrates relates how, bidden by a recurring dream to &quot;make and cultivate music&quot;, he wrote a hymn and then began writing poetry based on Aesop&#x27;s Fables.

Socrates tells Cebes to &quot;bid him (Socrates&#x27;s friend Evenus) farewell from me; say that I would have him come after me if he be a wise man&quot; Simmias expresses confusion as to why they ought hasten to follow Socrates to death. Socrates then states &quot;... he, who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to die; but he will not take his own life.&quot; Cebes raises his doubts as to why suicide is prohibited. He asks, &quot;Why do you say ... that a man ought not to take his own life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow one who is dying?&quot; Socrates replies that while death is the ideal home of the soul, man, specifically the philosopher, should not commit suicide except when it becomes necessary.

Man ought not to kill himself because he possesses no actual ownership of himself, as he is actually the property of the gods. He says, &quot;I too believe that the gods are our guardians, and that we men are a chattel of theirs&quot;. While the philosopher seeks always to rid himself of the body, and to focus solely on things concerning the soul, to commit suicide is prohibited as man is not sole possessor of his body. For, as stated in the &quot;Phaedo&quot;: &quot;the philosopher more than other men frees the soul from association with the body as much as possible&quot;. Body and soul are separate, then. The philosopher frees himself from the body because the body is an impediment to the attainment of truth.

Of the senses&#x27; failings, Socrates says to Simmias in the &quot;Phaedo&quot;:
Did you ever reach them (truths) with any bodily sense? – and I speak not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength, and, in short, of the reality or true nature of everything. Is the truth of them ever perceived through the bodily organs? Or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of each thing he considers?

The philosopher, if he loves true wisdom and not the passions and appetites of the body, accepts that he can come closest to true knowledge and wisdom in death, as he is no longer confused by the body and the senses. In life, the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by bodily senses of pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. Death, however, is a rite of purification from the &quot;infection&quot; of the body. As the philosopher prepares for death his entire life, he should greet it amicably and not be discouraged upon its arrival, for since the universe the gods created for us in life is essentially &quot;good&quot;, why would death be anything but a continuation of this goodness? Death is a place where better and wiser gods rule and where the most noble souls serve in their presence: &quot;And therefore, so far as that is concerned, I not only do not grieve, but I have great hopes that there is something in store for the dead ... something better for the good than for the wicked.&quot;

The soul attains virtue when it is purified from the body: &quot;He who has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and, so to speak, of the whole body, these being in his opinion distracting elements when they associate with the soul hinder her from acquiring truth and knowledge – who, if not he, is likely to attain to the knowledge of true being?&quot;

===The Cyclical Argument===
Cebes voices his fear of death to Socrates: &quot;... they fear that when she [the soul] has left the body her place may be nowhere, and that on the very day of death she may perish and come to an end immediately on her release from the body ... dispersing and vanishing away into nothingness in her flight.&quot;

In order to alleviate Cebes&#x27;s worry that the soul might perish at death, Socrates introduces his first argument for the immortality of the soul. This argument is often called the &quot;Cyclical Argument&quot;. It supposes that the soul must be immortal since the living come from the dead. Socrates says: &quot;Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, how could they have been born again?&quot;. He goes on to show, using examples of relationships, such as asleep-awake and hot-cold, that things that have opposites come to be from their opposite. One falls asleep after having been awake. And after being asleep, he awakens. Things that are hot came from being cold and vice versa. Socrates then gets Cebes to conclude that the dead are generated from the living, through life, and that the living are generated from the dead, through death. The souls of the dead must exist in some place for them to be able to return to life. Socrates further emphasizes the cyclical argument by pointing out that if opposites did not regenerate one another, all living organisms on Earth would eventually die off, never to return to life.

===The Recollection Argument===
Cebes realizes the relationship between the &quot;Cyclical Argument&quot; and Socrates&#x27; &quot;Theory of Recollection&quot;. He interrupts Socrates to point this out, saying:

... your favorite doctrine, Socrates, that our learning is simply recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous time in which we have learned that which we now recollect. But this would be impossible unless our soul had been somewhere before existing in this form of man; here then is another proof of the soul&#x27;s immortality.

Socrates&#x27; second argument, the &quot;Theory of Recollection&quot;, shows that it is possible to draw information out of a person who seems not to have any knowledge of a subject prior to his being questioned about it (a priori knowledge). This person must have gained this knowledge in a prior life, and is now merely recalling it from memory. Since the person in Socrates&#x27; story is able to provide correct answers to his interrogator, it must be the case that his answers arose from recollections of knowledge gained during a previous life.

===The Affinity Argument===
Socrates presents his third argument for the immortality of the soul, the so-called &quot;Affinity Argument&quot;, where he shows that the soul most resembles that which is invisible and divine, and the body resembles that which is visible and mortal. From this, it is concluded that while the body may be seen to exist after death in the form of a corpse, as the body is mortal and the soul is divine, the soul must outlast the body.

As to be truly virtuous during life is the quality of a great man who will perpetually dwell as a soul in the underworld. However, regarding those who were not virtuous during life, and so favored the body and pleasures pertaining exclusively to it, Socrates also speaks. He says that such a soul is:

... polluted, is impure at the time of her departure, and is the companion and servant of the body always and is in love with and bewitched by the body and by the desires and pleasures of the body, until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch and see, and drink and eat, and use for the purposes of his lusts, the soul, I mean, accustomed to hate and fear and avoid that which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible, but is the object of mind and can be attained by philosophy; do you suppose that such a soul will depart pure and unalloyed?

Persons of such a constitution will be dragged back into corporeal life, according to Socrates. These persons will even be punished while in Hades. Their punishment will be of their own doing, as they will be unable to enjoy the singular existence of the soul in death because of their constant craving for the body. These souls are finally &quot;imprisoned in another body&quot;. Socrates concludes that the soul of the virtuous man is immortal, and the course of its passing into the underworld is determined by the way he lived his life. The philosopher, and indeed any man similarly virtuous, in neither fearing death, nor cherishing corporeal life as something idyllic, but by loving truth and wisdom, his soul will be eternally unperturbed after the death of the body, and the afterlife will be full of goodness.

Simmias confesses that he does not wish to disturb Socrates during his final hours by unsettling his belief in the immortality of the soul, and those present are reluctant to voice their skepticism. Socrates grows aware of their doubt and assures his interlocutors that he does indeed believe in the soul&#x27;s immortality, regardless of whether or not he has succeeded in showing it as yet. For this reason, he is not upset facing death and assures them that they ought to express their concerns regarding the arguments. Simmias then presents his case that the soul resembles the harmony of the lyre. It may be, then, that as the soul resembles the harmony in its being invisible and divine, once the lyre has been destroyed, the harmony too vanishes, therefore when the body dies, the soul too vanishes. Once the harmony is dissipated, we may infer that so too will the soul dissipate once the body has been broken, through death.

Socrates pauses, and asks Cebes to voice his objection as well. He says, &quot;I am ready to admit that the existence of the soul before entering into the bodily form has been ... proven; but the existence of the soul after death is in my judgment unproven.&quot; While admitting that the soul is the better part of a man, and the body the weaker, Cebes is not ready to infer that because the body may be perceived as existing after death, the soul must therefore continue to exist as well. Cebes gives the example of a weaver. When the weaver&#x27;s cloak wears out, he makes a new one. However, when he dies, his more freshly woven cloaks continue to exist. Cebes continues that though the soul may outlast certain bodies, and so continue to exist after certain deaths, it may eventually grow so weak as to dissolve entirely at some point. He then concludes that the soul&#x27;s immortality has yet to be shown and that we may still doubt the soul&#x27;s existence after death. For, it may be that the next death is the one under which the soul ultimately collapses and exists no more. Cebes would then, &quot;... rather not rely on the argument from superior strength to prove the continued existence of the soul after death.&quot;

Seeing that the Affinity Argument has possibly failed to show the immortality of the soul, Phaedo pauses his narration. Phaedo remarks to Echecrates that, because of this objection, those present had their &quot;faith shaken,&quot; and that there was introduced &quot;a confusion and uncertainty&quot;. Socrates too pauses following this objection and then warns against misology, the hatred of argument.

===The Argument from the Form of Life===
Socrates then proceeds to give his final proof of the immortality of the soul by showing that the soul is immortal as it is the cause of life. He begins by showing that &quot;if there is anything beautiful other than absolute beauty it is beautiful only insofar as it partakes of absolute beauty&quot;.

Consequently, as absolute beauty is a &quot;Form,&quot; and so is Life, then anything which has the property of being animated with Life, participates in the Form of Life. As an example he says, &quot;will not the number three endure annihilation or anything sooner than be converted into an even number, while remaining three?&quot;. Forms, then, will never become their opposite. As the soul is that which renders the body living, and that the opposite of life is death, it so follows that, &quot;... the soul will never admit the opposite of what she always brings.&quot; That which does not admit death is said to be immortal.

Socrates thus concludes, &quot;Then, Cebes, beyond question, the soul is immortal and imperishable, and our souls will truly exist in another world. &quot;Once dead, man&#x27;s soul will go to Hades and be in the company of,&quot; as Socrates says, &quot;... men departed, better than those whom I leave behind.&quot; For he will dwell amongst those who were true philosophers, like himself.

== The conception of the soul ==
The &quot;Phaedo&quot; presents a real challenge to commentators through the way that Plato oscillates between different conceptions of the soul.

In the cyclical and Form-of-life arguments, for instance, the soul is presented as something connected with life, where, in particular in the final argument, this connection is spelled out concretely by means of the soul&#x27;s conceptual connection with life. This connection is further developed in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and &quot;Laws&quot; where the definition of soul is given as self-motion. Rocks, for instance, do not move unless something else moves them; inanimate, unliving objects are always said to behave this way. In contrast, living things are capable of moving themselves. Plato uses this observation to illustrate his famous doctrine that the soul is a self-mover: life is self-motion, and the soul brings life to a body by moving it.

Meanwhile, in the recollection and affinity arguments, the connection with life is not explicated or used at all. These two arguments present the soul as a knower (i.e., a mind). This is most clear in the affinity argument, where the soul is said to be immortal in virtue of its affinity with the Forms that we observe in acts of cognition.

It is not at all clear how these two roles of the soul are related to each other. But we observe this casual oscillation nevertheless throughout the dialogue and indeed throughout the whole corpus. For instance, consider this passage from &quot;Republic&quot; I:Is there any function of the soul that you could not accomplish with anything else, such as taking care of something (&quot;epimeleisthai&quot;), ruling, and deliberating, and other such things? Could we correctly assign these things to anything besides the soul, and say that they are characteristic (&quot;idia&quot;) of it?

No, to nothing else.

What about living? Will we deny that this is a function of the soul?

That absolutely is.Throughout the 20th century, scholars universally recognized this as a flaw in Plato&#x27;s theory of the soul, with this trend continuing and then ultimately being rejected in the 21st century.

Here are some examples of what scholars have said about this puzzle:

* Sarah Broadie says that “readers of the Phaedo sometimes take Plato to task for confusing soul as mind or that which thinks, with soul as that which animates the body.&quot;
* Dorothea Frede argued that “as to the exact nature of the soul we are left somehow in the dark by Plato in the &quot;Phaedo&quot; and also in &quot;Republic&quot; X.&quot;
* D.R. Campbell argued that &quot;Plato believes that the soul must be both the principle of motion and the subject of cognition because it moves things specifically by means of its thoughts.&quot;

==Legacy==
Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot; had a significant readership throughout antiquity, and was commented on by a number of ancient philosophers, such as Harpocration of Argos, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Paterius, Plutarch of Athens, Syrianus and Proclus. The two most important commentaries on the dialogue that have come down to us from the ancient world are those by Olympiodorus of Alexandria and Damascius of Athens.

The &quot;Phaedo&quot; has come to be considered a seminal formulation, from which &quot;a whole range of dualities, which have become deeply ingrained in Western philosophy, theology, and psychology over two millennia, received their classic formulation: soul and body, mind and matter, intellect and sense, reason and emotion, reality and appearance, unity and plurality, perfection and imperfection, immortal and mortal, permanence and change, eternal and temporal, divine and human, heaven and earth.&quot;

The Yakut people are a large ethnic group in Sakha. They are known for an epic poem called &quot;Olonkho&quot;. This epic is performed a cappella, generally at festivals, always by one man alone. The timbre and tone of the singer reveal the roles of the different characters.

The Republic has been represented in the Turkvision Song Contest since 2013, participating under the name Yakutia in the Turkvision Song Contest.

<text>Ystrad Mynach is a town in the Rhymney Valley in the Caerphilly County Borough, within the ancient county of Glamorgan, Wales, and is north of the town of Caerphilly. The urban area had a population of 19,204 in 2011. Before the Industrial Revolution and the coming of coal mining in the South Wales Coalfield the valley was rural and farmed. It lies in the community of Gelligaer.

== Etymology ==
In the Welsh language, &#x27; is a wide flat bottomed valley and &#x27; means &quot;monk&quot;. The form &#x27; is sometimes found in historical records, which Hywel Wyn Owen states is a dialect form of &#x27;. As there is a lack of evidence for monks settling in the area, the word may have been the name of a tributary of the Rhymney River.

It has been suggested that, rather than referring to a monastic institution, &#x27; is &#x27; &quot;place&quot; + &quot;&quot;, a suffix associated with the names of marshy floodplains, also found in nearby Llanbradach and Llancaiach. Prior to erection of defences on the River Rhymney in the 1960s the town was indeed subject to periodic flooding.

== Amenities and history ==
The town houses a number of council offices, as well as the Ystrad Mynach campus of Coleg y Cymoedd, a further education college established in 1959 to provide training for local coal miners and merged with neighbouring Coleg Morgannwg to form Coleg y Cymoedd in 2013.

The nearby Penallta Colliery was the last coal mine to close in the valley. Other notable buildings and structures are the Ystrad Mynach railway station, the viaduct, a sculpture to commemorate the areas industrial heritage, a community hospital, a number of schools, and the Beech Tree, Coopers Arms and Ye Olde Royal Oak pubs.

From 1927 to 1996, Ystrad Mynach hosted the &#x27;F&#x27; division headquarters of Glamorgan Constabulary (from 1968, South Wales Police).

Ystrad Mynach railway station was a location for one of Ronnie Barker&#x27;s &quot;Porridge&quot; episodes. Records show that Ystrad Mynach railway station was in existence in 1857, when it was known as Ystrad Junction.

A new Local General Hospital Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr was opened in late 2011. Work started on the Ystrad Fawr site in September 2007. It is located between the A469 Caerphilly to Newbridge Road and the old Caerphilly Road between Ystrad Mynach and Llanbradach. This replaced the services provided by the previous Ystrad Mynach Hospital.

Situated to the north of Ystrad Mynach, is a collection of houses called Tredomen; these houses were built to house the workers of the since-demolished Tredomen Works. They are socially graded houses – ranging from two-up two-down, to a five-bedroom manor in Park Lane with adjoining servants&#x27; quarters.

In February 2018, the Beech Tree Fish Bar was severely damaged in a car crash, and the incident made national news. No-one was killed, but three people were taken to hospital.

== Religion ==

The Anglican parish church for Ystrad Mynach and Llanbradach is Holy Trinity. It is a Grade II listed building, built in 1855–1857, by architect John Norton, for Revd George Thomas whose family were locally important landowners from Llanbradach.

Bryn Seion Welsh Church is a nondenominational church. Situated on Lisburn Road, it was built as a Baptist chapel during the mid-nineteenth century. It contains a mosaic, approximately square, with the name of the chapel, the chapel logo, the year of its construction, 1906 and geometric patterns.

The Methodist Church, on Lewis Street, was enlarged in 2013 to accommodate both worship and community groups. The Siloh Calvinistic Methodist chapel was opened on 10 May 1910, when the town was expanding following the opening of Penallta colliery in 1905–1910.

Bethany United Reformed Church is located on Lisburn Road.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Ystrad Mynach, at community and county borough level: Gelligaer Community Council and Caerphilly County Borough Council. Caerphilly County Borough Council has its main offices at Penallta House in the Tredomen area of Ystrad Mynach.

Ystrad Mynach historically straddled the ancient parishes of Gelligaer and Llanfabon, both of which were in the county of Glamorgan. Much of the boundary between the two parishes was the stream called Nant Caiach (roughly following Nelson Road, the A472), with Gelligaer to the north and Llanfabon to the south. Holy Trinity Church was built in 1855–1856 as a chapel of ease within the parish of Llanfabon. In 1890 Holy Trinity was made the parish church for a new ecclesiastical parish of Ystrad Mynach, covering parts of the civil parishes of Llanfabon and Gelligaer.

For civil purposes, Ystrad Mynach continued to straddle Gelligaer and Llanfabon. Llanfabon was administered as part of Caerphilly from 1893, whilst Gelligaer became an urban district in 1908. Caerphilly Urban District and Gelligaer Urban District were abolished in 1974, with both areas becoming part of Rhymney Valley District, being the first time that a district-level authority had covered all of Ystrad Mynach. Communities were established to replace the old parishes at the same time, with the communities initially using the boundaries of the abolished urban districts, and so Ystrad Mynach straddled the communities of Gelligaer and Caerphilly. The community boundaries were amended in 1985 to put Ystrad Mynach entirely within the community of Gelligaer.

The Office for National Statistics defines Ystrad Mynach as a built-up area sub-division within the wider Newport built-up area. The Ystrad Mynach sub-division covers Ystrad Mynach itself and Gelligaer, Hengoed, Maesycwmmer, and Penpedairheol, and had a population of 19,204 at the 2011 census. For postal purposes, Ystrad Mynach is not considered a post town, but instead comes under the Hengoed post town, CF82. Gelligaer Community Council calls Ystrad Mynach a town, whereas all the other places it covers (including Hengoed) it calls villages.

<doc id="1284788" wikidata="Q213967" url="?curid=1284788" title="Yonne (river)">
<text>The Yonne () is a river in France, a left-bank tributary of the Seine. It is long. The river gives its name to the Yonne &quot;département&quot;. It rises in the Nièvre &quot;département&quot;, in the Morvan hills near Château-Chinon. It flows into the river Seine at Montereau-Fault-Yonne.

The Yonne flows through the following &quot;départements&quot; and towns: 
*Nièvre: Château-Chinon, Clamecy
*Yonne: Auxerre, Migennes, Joigny, Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, Sens
*Seine-et-Marne: Montereau-Fault-Yonne

The main tributaries of the Yonne are the Vanne, the Armançon, the Serein and the Cure.

== History ==
The river was historically used for &quot;flottage&quot;, or the floating of rafts of timber from the Morvan forest to serve the needs of the capital, Paris. It was bypassed as a rafting waterway by the Canal du Nivernais in 1841, from near its source at Corbigny down to Auxerre.

In 1834 the engineer Charles Poirée had successfully tested his design for a needle weir, and this construction technique was adopted on the river Yonne. The first lock was built in the 1840s, the others from 1861. The locks were enlarged to Freycinet standards in the late 19th century, then again to their current dimensions after World War II.

== Navigation ==
The navigable river Yonne extends for , from Auxerre (junction with the Canal du Nivernais) to the confluence with the Seine. At Laroche-Migennes (PK 23), the Yonne connects with the Canal de Bourgogne. There are 9 locks on the river on the first section to Laroche-Migennes, the remaining 17 on the more gently-sloping lower course of the river.

<text>Gabor A. Somorjai (born May 4, 1935) is a professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, and is a leading researcher in the field of surface chemistry and catalysis, especially the catalytic effects of metal surfaces on gas-phase reactions (&quot;heterogeneous catalysis&quot;). For his contributions to the field, Somorjai won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1998, the Linus Pauling Award in 2000, the National Medal of Science in 2002, the Priestley Medal in 2008, the 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Science and the NAS Award in Chemical Sciences in 2013. In April 2015, Somorjai was awarded the American Chemical Society&#x27;s William H. Nichols Medal.

==Early history==

Somorjai was born in Budapest in 1935 to Jewish parents. He was saved from the Nazis when his mother sought the assistance of Raoul Wallenberg in 1944 who issued Swedish passports to Somorjai&#x27;s mother, himself and his sister saving them from the Nazi death camps. While Somorjai&#x27;s father ended up in the camp system, he was fortunate to survive but many of Somorjai&#x27;s extended family ended up in the camp system.

He was studying chemical engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 1956. As a participant in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Somorjai left Hungary to go to the US after the Soviet invasion. Along with other Hungarian immigrants, Somorjai enrolled in graduate study at Berkeley and obtained his doctorate in 1960. He joined IBM&#x27;s Thomas J. Watson Research Center staff in Yorktown Heights, New York for a few years but returned to Berkeley as an assistant professor in 1964.

==Chemical research==

The introduction of new technology such as low-energy electron diffraction revolutionised the study of surfaces in the 1950s and 1960s. However, early studies were limited to surfaces such as silicon, important for its electrical properties. In contrast, Somorjai was interested in surfaces such as platinum known for its chemical properties.

Somorjai discovered that the defects on surfaces are where catalytic reactions take place. When these defects break, new bonds are formed between atoms leading to complex organic compounds such as naphtha to be converted into gasoline as an example. These findings led to greater understanding of subjects such as adhesion, lubrication, friction and adsorption. His research also has important implications such as nanotechnology.

In the 1990s, Somorjai started working with physicist Y. R. Shen on developing a technique known as Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy to study surface reactions without the need for a vacuum chamber. He is also studying surface reactions in nanotechnology at the atomic and molecular level using atomic force microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy, both of which can be used without vacuum.

Somorjai&#x27;s expertise in surfaces was used as a consultant to the 2002 Winter Olympics where he gave advice on how to make ice-skating surfaces as fast as possible. Somorjai&#x27;s research had shed new light on ice, demonstrating that skaters skated on a top-layer of rapidly vibrating molecules, rather than on a layer of liquid water on top of the ice acting as a lubricant, which had previously been the generally accepted explanation for the slipperiness of ice.

During his career, Somorjai has published more than one thousand papers and three textbooks on surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. He is now the most-often cited person in the fields of surface chemistry and catalysis.

==Honors and awards==
Somorjai was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1979 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983. He was awarded the Wolf Foundation Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for his contribution to chemistry, sharing the honor with Professor Gerhard Ertl of the Fritz-Haber Institute in Berlin. Somorjai was awarded the National Medal of Science for his contribution as a chemist in 2002. The American Chemical Society has also awarded him the Peter Debye Award in Physical Chemistry and the Adamson Award in Surface Chemistry. In 2002, he was awarded the status of University Professor across the University of California network, an honor he shares with two dozen other academics. In 2004 he won the F.A. Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research of the American Chemical Society. In 2008 he received the Priestley Medal, the highest award of the American Chemical Society, for his &quot;extraordinarily creative and original contributions to surface science and catalysis&quot;. In 2009 he was named a Miller Senior Fellow of the Miller Institute at the University of California Berkeley. He was awarded the prestigious 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Science. In addition he was also awarded in 2010 the ENI New Frontiers of Hydrocarbons Prize and the Honda Prize. The recipient of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Gerhard Ertl, and other members of the surface science community, were surprised and mystified by the Nobel Prize committee&#x27;s decision to pass over Somorjai, awarding the prize for surface-chemistry to Ertl alone. In 2009 Somorjai was recipient of the Reed M. Izatt and James J. Christensen Lectureship. In 2013 Somorjai was awarded the National Academy of Sciences NAS Award in Chemical Sciences. In April 2015, Somorjai was awarded the American Chemical Society&#x27;s William H. Nichols Medal. Most recently, in 2023, Somorjai was recipient of the Enrico Fermi Award along with Darleane C. Hoffman.

==The Somorjai Award==
The Gabor A. Somorjai Award for Creative Research in Catalysis, consisting of US$5,000 and a certificate, is given annually to recognize outstanding research in the field of catalysis. The award is sponsored by the Gabor A. and Judith K. Somorjai Endowment Fund.

Previous recipients have been :

==The Gabor A. and Judith K. Somorjai Visiting Miller Professorship Award==

Established in 2011, the Gabor A. and Judith K. Somorjai Visiting Miller Professorship Award is one of the programs of the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California Berkeley. The Somorjais&#x27; wishes in the establishment of this award is to support visiting scientists in the broad field of chemical sciences for a one-month term in the Miller Institute. The first award was granted in 2013 to Angelos Michaelides.

<doc id="1284790" wikidata="Q1994975" url="?curid=1284790" title="Ayala Corporation">
<text>Ayala Corporation (, formerly &quot;Ayala y Compañía&quot;; ) is the publicly listed holding company for the diversified interests of the Ayala Group. Founded in the Philippines by Domingo Róxas and Antonio de Ayala during Spanish colonial rule, it is the country&#x27;s oldest and largest conglomerate. The company has a portfolio of diverse business interests, including investments in retail, education, real estate, banking, telecommunications, water infrastructure, renewable energy, electronics, information technology, automotive, healthcare, management, and business process outsourcing. As of November 2015, it is the country&#x27;s largest corporation in terms of assets ($48.7 billion).

==History==
&quot;Ayala y Compañía&quot; was established in 1876 and traces its origins to Casa Róxas, a partnership established in 1834 between Domingo Róxas and Antonio de Ayala. Casa Róxas began with the formation of a distillery which became known as the maker of Ginebra San Miguel. The distillery ultimately known as the Ayala Distillery was acquired by La Tondeña, Inc. in 1929.

In 1888, the company introduced the first tramcar service in the Philippines. The company participated in the construction of the Ayala Bridge over the Pasig River in Manila. Originally built of wood in 1872, the bridge was reconstructed in steel in 1908 to become the first steel bridge in the Philippines.

Under the leadership of Colonel Joseph Ralph McMicking - who was married to Mercedes Zobel de Ayala - the company was also responsible for the urban development of Makati after World War II. 

&quot;Ayala y Compañía&quot; shifted from a partnership to a corporation with the establishment of Ayala Corporation in 1968. It welcomed the minority investment of Mitsubishi Corporation as its strategic partner in 1974. The Ayala Corporation later became a public company in 1976. 

In 2011, the Ayala Corporation began building its renewable energy portfolio, beginning with a joint venture with Mitsubishi for solar power and Sta. Clara Power for run-of-the-river hydro power, and the purchase of the iconic Northwind farm for wind power. Ayala will contribute 1000 MW to the Philippine power supply by 2015. &quot;FinanceAsia&quot; named Ayala Corporation as the best-managed company in the Philippines in 2010 and 2015, as well as Best for Corporate Governance and Best for Corporate Social Responsibility.

<doc id="1284796" wikidata="Q6941941" url="?curid=1284796" title="Music in Tatarstan">
<text>Tatarstan is an autonomous republic within Russia, where the largest ethnic group are the Tatars. Their traditional music is a mixture of Turkic, Mongolic and Finno-Ugric elements, reportedly bridging Mongolian and Hungarian music. Nonetheless, the most distinguishing feature of Tatar music is the pentatonic scale, which aligns it with the Chinese and Vietnamese musical traditions. Instrumental dance music, secular song and sacred music are all a part of Tatar folk music. Instrumentation includes the kubyz (jaw harp), surnay, quray (flute) and garmon-talianka.

In the mid-20th century, a number of Tatar composers became renowned, including Cäwdät Fäyzi, Salix Säydäş, Mansur Mozaffarov and Näcip Cihanov. Many of the works of the Russian-Tatar composer Sofia Gubaidulina have been inspired by Tatar music.

The largest center of Tatar national music is the Jalil Opera and Ballet Theatre named after Musa Cälil. The first Tatar opera, &quot;Saniä&quot;, was staged in 1925. It was composed by Soltan Gabashi in collaboration with Vasili Vinogradov. Farit Yarullin was the creator of the first Tatar ballet, &quot;Şüräle&quot;. Modern Tatar music includes practically all existing basic musical genres. Almaz Monasypov is one of the first Soviet Tatar composers re-embodied in modern music the ancient layers of the national tradition like baits (), munajats () and book singing ().

Modern, non-traditional music includes pop, rock, hip-hop music (for example, İttifaQ), etc. One of the most remarkable artists, who obtained her own niche in Tatar music was the renowned world music singer and composer Zulya Kamalova. One of the most outstanding examples of contemporary Tatar music is the rock opera The Wanderer in Bulgar – an amalgamation of Tatar Folk Music, the Tatar Opera tradition and western rock music arrangements with Russian rock prints. Tatar pop singers Alsou (who sings in English, Russian and Tatar) and Zemfira (Bashkortostan-born who sings mostly in Russian) were among the most popular musical performers in Russia in 1990s and 2000s. Later, partly Tatar-speaking music projects Aigel and Tatarka gained popularity. The National Tatarstan Orchestra is the major symphony orchestra in Tatarstan.

<text>Jack Leslie Clark (November 25, 1925 – July 21, 1988) was an American television personality, game show host, and announcer. He is best known for hosting &quot;The Cross-Wits&quot;, and as an offstage announcer for &quot;Password&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. On the latter, he succeeded original announcer Charlie O&#x27;Donnell and held the role from 1980 until his death in 1988. (O&#x27;Donnell took back the announcing position until his own death in 2010.)

==Early career==
When Clark was a student at UC Berkeley, he began his career as a substitute radio announcer for radio station KROW in Oakland.

After graduating from UC Berkeley, he moved to New York City, and first worked as a game show announcer for &quot;Password&quot; (where, when the word was flashed on the screen, he would whisper from offstage, &quot;the password is...;&quot; he also occasionally substituted for host Allen Ludden). From there, he went on to host &quot;100 Grand&quot; (1963) and &quot;Dealer&#x27;s Choice&quot; from 1974–1975 (replacing Bob Hastings).

Later, Clark hosted &quot;The Cross-Wits&quot; from 1975 until 1980, where he was noted for his rapport with the celebrities and contestants. Clark later went on to announce for several other game shows, including &quot;Split Second&quot; (1972–1975), &quot;Tattletales&quot; (1974), &quot;Three for the Money&quot; (1975), &quot;Second Chance&quot; (1977), and some Hollywood-originated episodes of &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;. Earlier in 1967, Clark also did some commercials for Winston cigarettes in Super King (100 MM) size.

Clark also hosted a number of pilot episodes that never passed that stage. Among them were &quot;Second Guessers&quot;, &quot;The $10,000 Sweep&quot;, and a 1985 proposed revival of &quot;Now You See It&quot; (later sold in 1989). He was also the announcer on another pilot, &quot;Monday Night Quarterback&quot;. Clark did many of these pilots &quot;on spec&quot; as favors to their producers.

==&quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and later career==
After &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; announcer Charlie O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s departure from the show in 1980, Clark was chosen to become the show&#x27;s regular announcer. During that time, Clark announced the daytime version and the primetime syndicated version, when the show&#x27;s ratings peaked. Clark also announced for other television programs in the 1980s, including &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; (1982–1985), as well as being a spokesman for &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, appearing on-camera in their commercials.

==Illness and death==
In 1988, Clark was diagnosed with bone cancer. He continued announcing for &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; for as long as he was able to keep it up until the end of the 1987–88 season. During that time, hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White announced the fee plugs on the syndicated version. When he was away, Charlie O&#x27;Donnell and Johnny Gilbert began filling in as substitute announcers. 

Clark died on July 21, 1988, at the age of 62, just before production of the 1988–1989 season was to begin, and is interred at Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

He had requested that O&#x27;Donnell return to take his place, but since O&#x27;Donnell was not available due to his prior obligations with Barris Industries, Los Angeles-area disc jockey M.G. Kelly announced from mid-1988 to February 1989, when O&#x27;Donnell returned to the show. O&#x27;Donnell remained as the announcer until his death in 2010.

<text>The University Philosophical Society (UPS), commonly known as The Phil, is a student paper-reading and debating society in Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. Founded in 1683, it describes itself as the oldest student, collegial and paper-reading society in the world.

The society is based within the Graduates Memorial Building of Trinity College. Throughout its history, it has welcomed many notable guests and some of its members have included Ernest Walton, John Butler Yeats, Samuel Beckett, Bram Stoker and Oscar Wilde.

==Society==
The Phil&#x27;s members meet every Thursday during term to discuss a paper, debate a motion or hear an address. Traditionally a paper-reading society, meetings sometimes continue the format of responses to a paper rather than debate on a motion.

Its rooms are within the Graduates&#x27; Memorial Building (GMB) of Trinity College, which it has shared with the College Historical Society (&quot;the Hist&quot;) since the building&#x27;s construction in 1902, where it provides facilities for its members such as a games and a conversation room. The Phil shares the use of its Bram Stoker Room with the College Theological Society (&quot;the Theo&quot;). It holds most of its meetings in the GMB&#x27;s Debating Chamber with meetings having an expected audience of above two hundred being held in the larger lecture theatres of the college.

The society also hosts social events, internal competitions, sporting events, blood drives and the occasional concert. It also holds debating workshops and developmental competitions for members and school children. It has a &quot;strong history&quot; in intervarsity debating competitions, at both an international and national level.

Membership of the society is open to all Undergraduate and Postgraduate students, as well as all staff members of Trinity College. It offers four year membership to students of the university.

The society publishes &quot;The Philander&quot; as an annual freshers&#x27; guide to the society.

==History==

The history of the University Philosophical Society spans over three centuries, several guises, identities and name changes.

===Origins===
In 1683, natural philosopher and political writer William Molyneux (b. 1656) founded the Dublin Philosophical Society, with the assistance of his brother Sir Thomas Molyneux and future Provost St George Ashe. They intended it to be the equivalent of the Royal Society in London (with which it maintained cultural ties) as well as the Philosophical Society at the University of Oxford. The society was traditionally a paper reading society; however it also included many demonstrations of the latest science and mathematical endeavour of that era. The first meeting on 15 October 1683 was in the Provost&#x27;s lodgings at Trinity College Dublin, a location where members continued to meet.

Sometime after December 1683, Provost Robert Huntington became the society&#x27;s first Senior Patron, promising protection and assistance, a role the Provost of Trinity College still holds. While at the time no particular precedent existed for Trinity College to recognise it, it can be considered the college&#x27;s first such society.

On 1 November 1684 William Petty was elected as the first President of the society, and William Molyneux elected as its first Secretary. The current numbering takes this as the first session of the University Philosophical Society.

===Reformation in the 19th century===

In November 1842, to mark the original session date the Dublin Philosophical Society was fully reformed under its original name, traditionally meeting on Mondays, to cater for those Trinity College students too young to join other societies in Dublin. The first meeting took place in Marlborough Street.

At the time, undergraduates were not allowed to join most College societies, such as the College Historical Society. It then became the Dublin University Philosophical Society in February 1843 when it was recognized by the college, with then Provost Franc Sadleir reassuming the traditional role of Senior Patron.

During this time the society had its rooms in No. 4 (now House 4) in Parliament Square with larger meetings taking place within the Examination Hall.

In 1860, the Dublin University Philosophical Society changed its name to the University Philosophical Society. The society claims to be the oldest, student, paper-reading, and collegial society in the world. As of the 1960s, the society still dated its foundation back to 1853, describing the 1969 session as its &quot;116th&quot;. The current numbering of sessions emphasises the societies’ historical connection to the Dublin Philosophical Society, and treats the foundation of The University Philosophical Society as a reinstatement of that society, rather than the foundation of a new society.

Among the notable events held was the demonstration of an early telephone by Stephen Yeates in 1865.

===20th century===

The society suffered greatly, with the rest of Trinity College during the First World War. Ireland was still part of the British Empire during the outbreak of the war and so many Irish enlisted. However, there was a diverse mixture between members who predominantly described as being part of the Protestant Ascendancy and those who believed more in Irish republicanism.
The meetings and overall strength of the society was massively diminished during the period, with there being no Inaugural Meeting from 1913 until 1919 after the end of the war.

From 1913 to 1916 ten officers of the society resigned their positions to enlist. Minutes from the time mention that many more members of the society would go on to enlist, however their names went unrecorded.

In 1919 the names of eight past officers and members of council of the society who had been killed during the war was read aloud at the Opening Meeting.

* James Austin, President 1913-1914.
* AEL West, President 1915-1916.
* Reverend Everard Digges La Touche, Secretary 1907-1908.
* JHF Leland, Treasurer 1909-1910.
* Walter Osborne Varian, Treasurer 1915-1916.
* JS West, Registrar 1914-1915.
* Francis George McGibney, Member of Council 1912-1913.
* William Kee, Member of Council 1914-1915.

The Irish War of Independence began shortly after the beginning of 1919, public and political will to remember those lost during the war was weak. This meant that the names of many more members of the society who were also killed during the First World War went unrecorded by the society.

The Second World War, had a lesser effect on the society, though one notable President of the early 1940s was lawyer, Nigerian independence activist and Supreme Court Chief Justice Udo Udoma.

In 1953, the society held a centenary celebration, commemorating its &quot;First Hundred Years&quot;.

===Dublin University Elizabethan Society (&quot;The Eliz&quot;)===

The first female students were admitted to the college in 1904; however, they were unable to join any of the student societies that existed at the time. In response to this, the Dublin University Elizabethan Society (more commonly known as &quot;The Liz&quot; and later, &quot;The Eliz&quot;) was founded in 1905 by the first woman student of the university Isabel Marion Weir Johnston. The society was a female-only debating society, having sent teams to the Irish Times National Debating Championship from relatively early in the competition&#x27;s history. It also hosted many debates, paper discussions, group discussions and the Eliz Garden Party (within Fellow&#x27;s Square), considered one of the social highlights of Trinity term in the college. Each year the society welcomed esteemed guests to speak on topics regarding the history, the societal limitations of women, and feminism. These included such guests as Ninette de Valois, dancer and founder of The Royal Ballet, who visited in late 1964 to celebrate the society&#x27;s 60th year.

The society had its rooms in House 6 in Parliament Square, housing many amenities for female students within the college, including one of only a handful of female toilets on the campus.

Over the years there were numerous debates within both the University Philosophical Society and the Dublin University Elizabethan Society regarding a merger of both societies into one. There was strong individual opposition within both societies however, with a vote in 1968 by the Eliz rejecting a merger. However, in 1981 the Dublin University Elizabethan Society merged with the University Philosophical Society, which vastly increased female membership and increased debating within the society.

Previously, the highest ranking female officer of the Phil was accorded the honorary title of President of the Elizabethan Society as a symbolic gesture but beginning in 2024, elections were held to elect the Chair of the 119th session.

====Inclusion of women====
In Trinity News’ edition of 25 November 1953, an anonymous female contributor declared that &quot;The bar to the admission of women to [the other] major societies ...is a real deprivation to everyone––to College women, to the members of the societies, themselves and, most important, to the University&quot;. The 1953/54 session of the Phil made long-overdue advances in gender equality. Women were at last allowed to attend public business meetings and to speak at them, provided that Standing Orders were suspended. At the end of that session, membership was opened up to women. This final breakthrough proved short-lived as the College Board voted down female membership in early 1955 for that year – although it had no direct constitutional jurisdiction in this matter – pending possible reorganisation of the Major Societies. Although it was perhaps an understandable decision from the Board&#x27;s point of view, the Board never subsequently enacted such restructuring. At periodic intervals, mergers were suggested between the Phil and the Hist; the Phil and the Eliz; and the Phil, the Student Representative Council (SRC), and the Eliz. Nothing ever came of these proposed mergers and the Phil and Hist remain separate entities. Due to a number of factors, including divisions between the various factions, the College never addressed this issue, nor did they address the creation of student union-type facilities, as are commonplace in the debating unions of other institutes of higher education. 

It was not until the 1963/64 session that a further vote was taken by the Phil on the admission of women, although it was lost by only three votes. However, some advances were made: from that session onwards, it was agreed that women could reply to papers read to the Society. In 1965, Joanna Walmsley became the first woman to present a paper to the society, entitled &quot;Tolstoy––Realist or Moralist?&quot;. One of concerns raised over the years had been that the Society&#x27;s facilities were generally inadequate for a larger mixed membership. In session 1967/1968. opposition caused then-President of the Phil Gordon Ledbetter to resign over the issue. At the first Council meeting and a subsequent private business meeting in the following session (1967/68), this concern again featured prominently. Many in the Phil also felt that the way forward could be achieved by revisiting the idea of a merger with the Eliz to form a Major Society. However, regardless of the issue of finding satisfactory accommodation for such a body, the Eliz still were not sufficiently interested in such a proposal.

In subsequent years the existing compromise with regard to female participation was found to be unsatisfactory within the active membership. A motion calling for women to be admitted as full members was proposed and debated at a private business meeting on the 30th of November 1967 and was passed. President of the Phil Geoff Goolnik remarked that restrictions on female membership had in actuality been a matter of convention, as gender had never been mentioned in the Laws of the Society, unlike those of the Eliz and the Hist.

At the following private business meeting held on the 5th of December, three women were proposed and voted in as members, including President of the Eliz Elizabeth Hall. Hall was nominated by Goolnik and the motion was seconded by Auditor of the Hist ‘Gully’ Stanford in his capacity as an Ordinary Member of the Phil. Gráinne Monks was the first female member to address the society after the full inclusion of women, and she was elected the first female Member of Council in February 1968.

===21st century===
Today the University Philosophical Society is one of the largest student societies within the college and in Ireland. Its meetings include weekly paper readings and debates. Additionally it invites many internationally-esteemed guests to address the society each year, including such public figures as Al Pacino, Desmond Tutu, Angela Merkel, and Stephen Fry.

==Governance==
The Phil is governed by a Council elected by the members of the society each year. There are nine officers: President, Secretary, Treasurer, Registrar, Debates Convenor, Librarian, Steward, Schools Convenor, and Auteur. All officers are directly elected. In addition to the officers there are fifteen Members of Council. The Members of Council serve as deputies to the officers, aid in the execution of their responsibilities, and perform any other such work necessary for the efficient running of the society. Seven are directly elected each year. One of these seven is then selected by the council to serve as Vice President of the society. The Senior Member of Council is also elected in the same manner as the officers of the society and is delegated the responsibility of co-ordinating the other Members of Council. The newly elected Council may then add up to seven further Members of Council via co-option.

==Bram Stoker Club==

In addition to its usual events, the society added a subcommittee, the Bram Stoker Club (more commonly known as Bram), to its organisation in 2011. Named after one of the Phil&#x27;s most illustrious presidents (Bram Stoker), the club holds weekly afternoon paper-readings on a range of topics. These paper-readings have served to carry on the long tradition of the society, which had fallen slightly out of fashion in recent years.

In January 2013, the club was incorporated into the official laws of the University Philosophical Society by majority vote. This was then officially recognised by the Dublin University Central Societies Committee in March of the same year.

It had its first foray outside of college in 2013, entering the winning team of John Engle and Liam Brophy in that year&#x27;s Irish Times National Debating Championship.

During the 4th Session, the club welcomed three living descendants of its namesake Bram Stoker. Noel Dobbs, Robin MacCaw and Dacre Stoker met with members of the club and society at large. Each presented papers on the history of Bram Stoker and legacy of Dracula within their family. Also in attendance was distant relative and Senator David Norris. Finally, the Stoker family presented the club with portrait of Bram Stoker by Dublin artist Damian Byrne and a plaque specifying the connection between the society and their ancestor.

==Competitive debating==
===External debating competitions===
The society has a presence on the competitive debating circuit. Having first won the Irish Times National Debating Championship in 1961 the society has gone on to win and place in several other well known debating competitions. These include the John Smith Memorial Mace, World Universities Debating Championship, Irish National Law Debates, Cork IV and the UCD Vice Presidents&#x27; Cup IV.. In 2022, Dylan McCarthy and Jack Palmer from the Phil won the European Universities Debating Championships in Zagreb, becoming the second Irish team to win the championships and the first from Trinity. 
===Internal debating competitions===
The society runs several internal debating competitions each year.
These consist of:
*The Eamon O&#x27;Coine Memorial Maiden Speaker&#x27;s Competition (or &quot;Maidens&quot;); for first-time speakers in college.
*The Jeremy Clarkson Memorial Debating Competition (or &quot;Clarkies&quot;), consisting of a series of regular weekly debates.; satirically named after TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson. Formerly known as The Maggies, after former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher 
*The Elizabethan Society Memorial Pro-Am Competition (or &quot;Lizzies&quot;); a competition whereby experienced debaters (Pros) are teamed with less experienced speakers (Ams). 
* The Isabel Marion Weir Johnston Memorial (or &quot;Izzy&#x27;s&quot;); is an internal competition for all members of the society. It is named in honour of the first woman to enter Trinity where she went on to found the Elizabethan Society which later merged with the Philosophical Society.
*The J.P Mahaffy Memorial (or &quot;Mahaffy&#x27;s&quot;); named after former President of the society John Pentland Mahaffy internal debating competition for Junior Freshman (&quot;fresher&quot;) teams of two.

===Trinity Intervarsity===
Each year, normally in January, the society jointly with the Hist hosts the Claire Stewart Trinity IV. Before 2015 this consisted of the Trinity Invitational and the Dean Swift Intervarsity. In 2015, the Trinity Invitational was replaced with Trinity Women&#x27;s Debating Competition.

==Phil Speaks==

The &#x27;Phil Speaks Debating and Public Speaking Initiative&#x27;, commonly known as &#x27;Phil Speaks&#x27;, is a campaign aimed at promoting, as well as developing skills in public speaking and oratory. Formed by the society in 2004 the initiative combines in-school oratory workshops, with Pro–Am (Professional-Amateur) learning competitions to encourage these skills in students of all secondary schools throughout Ireland.

At the end of the contest, the society hosts the Phil Speaks Competitive Weekend modelled on the format of a University Intervarsity Competition held within the Graduates Memorial Building, with the grand final taking place in the Debating Chamber.

==Awards==
Annually, the society internally awards the author of the best paper and the best chamber speaker from its membership, medals of oratory and composition. The society also awards the Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage and the Bram Stoker Medal to various guests each year.

Among the awards received by the society are awards from the internal Central Societies Committee of Trinity College, including the &quot;best event&quot; award for &#x27;This House Believes that Society is Failing People with Disabilities&#x27; in 2019 and &quot;best large society&quot; in 2015.

The society has also received a &quot;Best individual (Large Society)&quot; award, from the Board of Irish College Societies (BICS), in 2013.

==Honorary patrons==
Through its years in college, the Society has recorded the presence of many notable guests, the most distinguished of whom are named honorary patrons of the society. Included amongst these are multiple Nobel Prize laureates, both before and after their receipt of the Prize, such as W. B. Yeats, Heads of State and of Government, notable actors and musicians, as well as well-known intellectuals. Guests have also included all Taoisigh since Charles Haughey.

==Controversies==
A number of guests, invited by the Phil over the years, have courted controversy. Contributors to its debates included Oswald Mosley during his residence in Ireland. In 1988, the Society invited then–Holocaust denier David Irving to speak. A large protest by students, staff, Jewish groups, socialists, and anti-Nazi activists resulted in the meeting being relocated to a hotel conference room and held in the small hours of the morning. The traditional vote of thanks to Irving for his paper was defeated, which is rare in the society&#x27;s history.
The address of Austrian politician Jörg Haider to the society in late 2002 led to a protest by self-described anti-fascist activists, which continued through the debate, with noise being made outside the chamber and interjections in the society&#x27;s proceedings within. An invitation to British National Party (BNP) official Tony Wentworth was revoked after threats of physical action by leftist groups.

Another guest to generate controversy was Islamist Anjem Choudary, who hailed the 9/11 terrorists as martyrs. Former Taoiseach John Bruton threatened to withdraw from a Phil debate later that year over this invitation, which was not withdrawn. Bruton later became an Honorary Patron of the Society, and Anjem Choudary has been invited to speak at the Phil&#x27;s lectern several times.

In 2011, the Phil encountered controversy when it invited BNP leader Nick Griffin to speak at a Thursday night debate on immigration. After raging protests, talks with college officials and physical threats made to the members and council the invitation was reluctantly withdrawn by the President of the 327th session, Eoin O&#x27;Liathain. In a press statement the Phil said that &quot;it is unfortunate that circumstances have arisen under which the planned debate can no longer go ahead without compromising the safety of staff and students&quot;. Despite these challenges the session would go on to be voted Best Society in Trinity College that year.

In 2015, members of the Phil were asked by the President to collect copies of &quot;The University Times&quot; after the newspaper printed details of confidential correspondence that had been supplied to the newspaper in the understanding that it would not be referred to in an article. While &quot;The University Times&quot; subsequently agreed to withdraw the edition of the paper in question from circulation, after their breach of journalistic standards, &quot;Trinity News&quot; falsely reported that members of council had discussed calling a motion to impeach the president as a result of the society&#x27;s actions in collecting the newspapers. A motion of confidence in the president was later passed at a general meeting of the society. The incident was cited as one of the factors leading to Samuel Riggs, then the editor of &quot;The University Times&quot;, agreeing to take a permanent leave of absence from his position as well as the resignation of two senior Trinity News editors.

<text>Rudolf Wlassak (27 March 1865, Brno - 10 March 1930, Vienna) was an Austrian physiologist and neurologist. He was a pioneer in the hospital treatment of alcoholism.

He was born in Brno, Austrian Empire (now Czech Republic). He studied medicine at the University of Leipzig, and in 1893 qualified as a lecturer in Zürich. After time spent in Rome and Florence, he started a neurological practice in Vienna Neustadt (1919), and worked with Emil Redlich at the Maria-Theresien-Schlössel Hospital in Vienna. In 1922 he became director of a sanatorium for alcoholics called &quot;Am Steinhof&quot;. 

He conducted research on the structure of cerebellum and on the physiology of the senses and spatial perception.

He was active in the treatment of alcoholics in Vienna, and more widely in Europe. He is remembered for his contributions towards the workers&#x27; temperance movement. In 1897 he published &quot;&quot;Gegen den Alkohol&quot; and his &quot;Grundriss der Alkoholfrage&quot; was published in 1922. From 1902 onward, he was editor of the journal &quot;Der Abstinent&quot;&quot;. In 1907 his treatise, &quot;The influence of alcohol upon the functions of the brain&quot;, was published in English.

He died in Vienna.

<text>David Leavitt (; born June 23, 1961) is an American novelist, short story writer, and biographer.

==Biography==
Leavitt was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Gloria and Harold Leavitt. Harold was a professor who taught at Stanford University and Gloria was a political activist. Leavitt grew up in Palo Alto, California, and graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in English in 1983. After his first book&#x27;s success, he spent much of the 1990s living in Italy working and restoring an old house in Semproniano in Tuscany with his partner. He has also taught at Princeton University.

While a student at Yale, Leavitt published two stories in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Territory&quot; and &quot;Out Here&quot;, both of which were included in his first collection, &quot;Family Dancing&quot; (nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award and finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award). Other published fiction includes the short-story collections &quot;A Place I&#x27;ve Never Been&quot;, &quot;Arkansas: Three Novellas&quot; and &quot;The Marble Quilt&quot; and the novels &quot;The Lost Language of Cranes&quot;, &quot;Equal Affections&quot;, &quot;While England Sleeps&quot; (finalist for the Los Angeles Times Fiction Prize), &quot;The Page Turner&quot;, &quot;Martin Bauman&quot;, &quot;The Body of Jonah Boyd&quot; and &quot;The Indian Clerk&quot; (finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award and shortlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Award).

In 2000, Leavitt moved to Gainesville, Florida, and became a member of the Creative Writing faculty at the University of Florida as well as the founder and editor of the literary journal &quot;Subtropics&quot;.

Leavitt, who is gay, has frequently explored gay issues in his works. As a teenager, he was frequently frightened by gay novels that emphasized the ideal male body. He found this theme, and its suggestion that homoerotic fulfillment was reserved for the exceptionally beautiful young men, intrusive. His writing explores universal themes such as complex family relationships and class and sex exploitation. Illness and death are also recurrent themes in his work, inspired by his experience with his mother&#x27;s cancer and death when he was growing up.

Leavitt&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;The Body of Jonah Boyd&quot; is dedicated to the Palo Alto house he grew up in, 743 Cooksey Lane. This house has since then gained notoriety for being the site of Sam Bankman-Fried&#x27;s house arrest.

Despite writing many novels, Leavitt has said he feels more confident as a short story writer. He has been criticized for writing too quickly, which he attributes to early experiences with death convincing him that his life as a writer would be short. His work has been considered minimalist as well as part of the literary Brat Pack, but he has made &quot;a fierce effort to disassociate&quot; himself from both. He considers his works too long, emotional and descriptive to be minimalist.

Leavitt’s favorite novelist is Penelope Fitzgerald, his favorite works of hers being &quot;The Beginning of Spring&quot;, &quot;The Gate of Angels&quot; and &quot;The Blue Flower&quot;. He has also been influenced by John Cheever, Alice Munro, Cynthia Ozick, Joseph Roth, W. G. Sebald, and Grace Paley, whom he credits for teaching him the importance of humble experiences in great fiction.

==Copyright suit==
In 1993, the English poet Stephen Spender sued Leavitt for copyright infringement over the publication of his novel &quot;While England Sleeps&quot;, accusing him of using elements of Spender&#x27;s memoir &quot;World Within World&quot; in the novel. Viking-Penguin, Leavitt&#x27;s publisher at the time, withdrew the book. In 1995, Houghton Mifflin published a revised version with a preface by Leavitt addressing the controversy.

In &quot;Courage in the Telling: The Critical Rise and Fall of David Leavitt&quot;, Drew Patrick Shannon argues that the critical backlash that accompanied Spender&#x27;s suit &quot;allowed [critics] to reinforce the boundaries between gay and mainstream literature that Leavitt had previously crossed&quot;. Subsequent reviews of Leavitt&#x27;s work were more favorable. The episode provided Leavitt with the basis for his novella &quot;The Term-Paper Artist&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Two of Leavitt&#x27;s novels have been filmed: &quot;The Lost Language of Cranes&quot; (1991) was directed by Nigel Finch and &quot;The Page Turner&quot; (released under the title &quot;Food of Love&quot;) was directed by Ventura Pons. The rights to a third, &quot;The Indian Clerk&quot;, have been optioned by Scott Rudin.

<doc id="1284811" wikidata="Q4118511" url="?curid=1284811" title="Music of Buryatia">
<text>Buryatia is a part of the Russian Federation. One of the country&#x27;s main instruments is a two-stringed horse-head fiddle called a &quot;morin khuur&quot;. This is an instrument closely linked to the all-important cult of the horse, belonging to the intangible heritage of all Mongolic peoples. Other elements of Buryat music, such as the use of fourths both in tuning instruments and in songs, and pentatonic scales, reveal similarities to music from Siberia and Eastern Asia. There traditionally was no polyphony, instead voices and instruments performed the same melody in unison but varied in timing and ornamentation.

Narrative structures are a part of most Buryat folk music, often in the form of epic tales, and the last song of famous leaders; these include the &quot;Last Song of Rinchin Dorzhin&quot;.

Under Soviet control, Buryat folk music was sanitized and mostly allowed in forms that were supportive of the state&#x27;s power. This period saw state-approved songs recollecting events such as the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War.

The first Buryat rock band was Uragsha, who were one of the few bands of the time to sing both in Russian and their native Mongolian language. Their collaborations with La MaMa theater in New York City in late 1990s led to their embrace of traditional music and shamanic roots too, and eventually to formation of the group Namgar that represents Buryat traditional music at world music festivals since 2001.

Vladlen Pantaev is also a notable Buryat musician; one of the key composers of Buryat folk music. He has devoted many years to the National Theater in Ulan-Ude. Many of his songs are widely recognized in the region.

<text>Suristan was used as a name in two senses during the Sassanid Persian Empire 226 to 651 AD.
It was used to designate the Persian province of Surestan, roughly the same as today&#x27;s Syria, as opposed to Asuristan, which was a separate province corresponding to Babylonia (central-southern Iraq). It was also the name of the Sassanid city of Surestan (today&#x27;s Kufa in Iraq), situated in the Persian province of Middle Bih-Kavad.

<text>Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi (1859 – December 1920) was a Fijian Ratu and early colonial administrator in what was then the British Crown Colony of Fiji.

==Heritage==
Born in Bau, Madraiwiwi was the son of Bauan chief and rebel &quot;Ratu&quot; Mara Kapaiwai, who had been executed by his cousin Seru Epenisa Cakobau on 6 August 1859, shortly after Madraiwiwi&#x27;s birth. His mother, &quot;Adi&quot; Loaloakubou was half-sister of &quot;Ratu&quot; Cakobau the Vunivalu of Bau and later King of Fiji. Her marriage to Mara Kapaiwai came after she had been promised first to the Tui Nakelo in return for support against one of many campaigns between Bau and Rewa; this promise was reneged upon, and she was given to &quot;Ratu&quot; Gavidi, Komai Nadrukuta. She was widowed on 26 April 1850 when Gavidi was shot in the back during a skirmish with the rival vanua of Verata. Prior to his execution, Mara Kapaiwai named his son Madraiwiwi, meaning &quot;sour bread&quot;.

Madraiwiwi was raised in Cakobau&#x27;s household. He was educated in Navuloa by Methodist missionaries before entering the civil service as an audit clerk. In 1887 Madraiwiwi married &quot;Adi&quot; Litiana Maopa, a granddaughter of Cakobau. They had six children; Lala Sukuna (later one of the main leaders of Fiji), Asenaca Teimumu Vuikaba, Tiale Vuiyasawa, Kacaraini Loaloakubou, J.A.R. Dovi (Fiji&#x27;s first qualified doctor) and Timoci Tavanavanua.

Madraiwiwi progressed rapidly through the civil service and was appointed to the Legislative Council. In 1896 he became the &quot;Roko Tui&quot; of Ra Province, the highest position open to Fijians. He also began serving as &quot;Roko Tui&quot; of Bua Province in 1904, before being appointed &quot;Roko Tui&quot; of Tailevu Province in 1912.

<doc id="1284834" wikidata="Q4893770" url="?curid=1284834" title="Bernard Youens">
<text>Bernard Arthur Popley (28 December 1914 – 27 August 1984), better known by his stage name Bernard Youens, was an English character actor of stage and television, and briefly appeared in radio plays and had cameos in film. He was also a TV announcer and is perhaps best remembered for his portrayal of Stan Ogden in the serial soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; from 1964 until his death in 1984.

==Early years==

Born in Hove, Sussex, Youens began his stage career as a 16-year-old after becoming assistant stage manager at the Players Theatre in Newcastle upon Tyne. Youens was from a working class family who had no theatre connections. He went on to spend much of the 1930s honing his craft in repertory theatre. His acting career was interrupted by World War II, during which he served as a corporal with the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) in North Africa and Italy. He was wounded by shrapnel in his right leg in Anzio in February 1944. He returned to rep after the war, while also working as a publican, bread salesman, van driver and a labourer.

==Stage==
Youens was a member of Frank Fortesque&#x27;s Players after the war. Bernard &quot;Bunny&quot; Graham (Youens used Graham as a stage name at the time; Bunny was his wife&#x27;s pet name for him) appears in the film &quot;Cup-tie Honeymoon&quot;, a Mancunian Films production, with Betty Jumel.
This was the first film to be shot at their Rusholme Studio in Manchester, with exteriors filmed at Maine Road football ground and Abney Hall in Cheadle. In the film, veteran comedian Sandy Powell performed one of his stage sketches, &quot;The Soldier’s Return Home&quot;, with a young actress, Pat Pilkington, later known as Pat Phoenix who played Elsie Tanner in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Despite dreadful reviews, the film was a success in the North West.

==Television==
Youens became a continuity announcer in May 1956 for Granada Television, which had just been launched, in which his velvet-voiced tones were in marked contrast to the character for which he would gain national attention. Youens also took minor roles in several ITV series at the time, and radio plays such as William Wilberforce on the BBC Home Service in October 1959 although he declined the chance to audition for &quot;Coronation Street&quot; when it was launched, preferring the security of his announcer&#x27;s role, before eventually passing an audition. His first words were &quot;A pint of mild and 20 fags, missus&quot; in June 1964. His role resulted in him often being engaged to open fetes and stores (such as the reopened FW Woolworth in South Shields in 1970.)

When asked what he thought when a national British newspaper had dubbed his character &quot;the uncrowned king of the non-working classes&quot;, he replied: &quot;Stan is my creation and I am proud of him.&quot; Youens was delighted to meet Sir John Betjeman, then the Poet Laureate, who had for many years expressed a desire to meet &quot;Hilda and her ghastly husband&quot;. Meet they did, and Youens often commented that Betjeman, bounding around the studios meeting everyone &quot;like a schoolboy&quot; was a fond memory. The Lord Olivier also expressed a wish to appear in the programme. Olivier&#x27;s schedule precluded an intended uncredited appearance in a January 1978 episode, and, in the bar at Granada TV, Youens told him, &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry I couldn&#x27;t appear opposite you&quot;, to which Olivier replied: &quot;Not as sorry as I am.&quot; In May 1982, Youens met the Queen when she visited the set of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. On 23 January 1984, he and Jean Alexander attended a showbusiness reception at 10 Downing Street with other &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actors.

==Illness and death==
A heavy smoker, Youens suffered a heart attack in 1972, and then on 30 October 1975 suffered a stroke which left him with a speech difficulty, though speech therapy eradicated some of this. The writers brought in Eddie Yeats (Geoffrey Hughes) as a lodger for Stan and Hilda. This reduced Youens&#x27;s dialogue and allowed him to continue as a regular character until early 1984. His final &quot;Coronation Street&quot; appearance was on 7 March 1984. Having suffered most of his later life with severe arthritis in the neck and knees, Youens was taken into hospital on 2 April 1984 with the condition and over the next three months his health deteriorated rapidly. He suffered a 2nd stroke on 12 May 1984. Subsequently in July he contracted gangrene in his left leg, resulting in amputation. The explanation for his absence from &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was that he had been admitted to hospital after becoming ill, on the doctor&#x27;s orders after Hilda collapsed from exhaustion to the strain of looking after him as his health deteriorated. Youens died peacefully in his sleep at Salford Royal Hospital on 27 August 1984 after suffering a heart attack. He was 69. The decision to kill off the Stan Ogden character was made soon after Youens died, and on 21 November 1984 it was revealed onscreen that the character had died in hospital.

==Family==
Youens married Edna Swallow, known as &quot;Teddy&quot;, in Halifax on 21 September 1937. They had two daughters and three sons. His youngest son, Michael, was a film cameraman on many episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Edna died in 2001, aged 88.

<text>Most SNP (&quot;Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising&quot;), commonly referred to as Most Slovenského národného povstania or the UFO Bridge, and named Nový most (&quot;New Bridge&quot;) from 1993 to 2012, is a road bridge over the Danube in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. It is the world&#x27;s longest bridge to have one pylon and one cable-stayed plane.

Most SNP is an asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge with a main span length of , a total length of , a width of , and a weight of . Its steel construction is suspended from steel cables, connected on the Petržalka side to two pillars. There are four lanes for motor traffic on the upper level and lanes for bicycles and pedestrians on the lower level. It is a member of The World Federation of Great Towers.

==History==
Since its construction in 1972 the bridge was called &quot;Most SNP&quot; (&quot;Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising&quot;), although locally it was simply called the New Bridge, being the second bridge to be built in the city over the river Danube. In 1993, its name was officially changed by Bratislava City Council to &quot;Nový Most&quot; (&quot;New Bridge&quot;) to reflect general usage. However, another three bridges have been constructed since its opening, and so in 2012 the City Council voted to change the bridge&#x27;s name back to &quot;Most SNP&quot;. The change took effect on 29 August 2012, the 68th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising.

The bridge was built between 1967 and 1972 under a project managed by A. Tesár, J. Lacko and I. Slameň. It officially opened on August 26, 1972. A significant section of the Old Town below which included nearly all of the Jewish quarter, was demolished to create the roadway that led to it. On the other hand, the bridge improved access between Petržalka and the rest of the city. Parts of the historic city walls were unearthed during construction.

The SNP bridge was the central motif of Jean Michel Jarre&#x27;s &quot;Bridge from the Future&quot; concert, which he performed on May 12, 2024.

== Restaurant and observation deck ==
A special attraction is the flying saucer-shaped structure atop the bridge&#x27;s pylon, housing an observation deck and a restaurant, which since 2005 has been called &quot;UFO&quot; (previously, &quot;Bystrica&quot;). The restaurant serves both traditional Slovak and international cuisine, describing its cuisine as &quot;Mediterasian&quot;. It received the Restaurant of the Year award in 2011.

Both the restaurant and the observation deck offer panoramic views of Bratislava. They are reached using lifts located in the east pillar, accessed from the walking and cycling paths on either side of the bridge. Access to the lifts normally costs €11.90 as of January 2024, but this fee is deducted from the bill for restaurant guests.

The west pillar of the bridge tower houses an emergency staircase with 430 steps.

<doc id="1284857" wikidata="Q497510" url="?curid=1284857" title="International AIDS Society">
<text>The International AIDS Society (IAS) is the world&#x27;s largest association of HIV/AIDS professionals, with 11,600 members from over 170 countries , including clinicians, people living with HIV, service providers, policy makers and others. It aims to reduce the global impact of AIDS through collective advocacy. Founded in 1988, IAS headquarters are located in Geneva, and its president since 2024 is Beatriz Grinsztejn.

The IAS hosts the biennial International AIDS Conference, the IAS Conference on HIV Science, and the HIV Research for Prevention Conference.

== History ==
The IAS is a non-profit organization founded in 1988, with a mandate to organize the International AIDS Conference. Initially, the IAS headquarters were in Stockholm, and Lars-Olof Kallings was the secretary general from 1988 until 2003.

In 2004, the IAS restructured its organization, expanded the number of professional staff and moved the headquarters to Geneva. The move was intended to strengthen organizational links with other health NGOs and (United Nations) multilateral agencies.

==Mission and office-bearers==

The IAS is an advocacy body, using its large membership base and scientific leadership to drive action. It is the world&#x27;s largest association of HIV professionals, with 11,600 members from over 170 countries . Among its members are researchers, clinicians, people living with HIV, community advocates, policy makers and others.

Since August 2022, the president of IAS is Sharon Lewin, who is also the Director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, in Melbourne, Australia. The previous IAS President was Adeeba Kamarulzaman (since July 2020) of Malaysia, who succeeds Anton Pozniak. Kevin Osborne is executive director. Past presidents have included Helene D. Gayle, Joep Lange, Peter Piot, Linda-Gail Bekker, Chris Beyrer and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi.

== Conferences ==
=== International AIDS Conference ===
The International AIDS Conference (abbreviated AIDS 2012, AIDS 2014 and so on) is the world&#x27;s most attended conference on HIV and AIDS, and the largest conference on any global health or development issue in the world. First convened during the peak of the AIDS epidemic in 1985, they were held annually until 1994 when they became biennial. Each conference continues to provide a unique forum for the intersection of science, advocacy and human rights, as well as to strengthen policies and programmes that ensure an evidence-based response to the epidemic.

The 5th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 1989) in Montreal, Canada, from June 4 to 9, 1989, saw activists from ACT UP and its Canadian counterparts, AIDS Action Now! and Réaction-SIDA, raise awareness about HIV/AIDS challenges. Their disruption challenged the AIDS community&#x27;s hierarchy, advocating for more activism and advocacy in scientific circles. Notably, Canadian activists protested the lack of a federally funded AIDS strategy, while US activists condemned the US travel ban on people living with HIV, among other issues.

The 16th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2006) was held in Toronto, Canada, on August 13 to 18, 2006. The theme for the conference was &quot;Time to Deliver.&quot;

The 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) was held in Amsterdam on 21 to 27 July 2018. Primary topics of note included: Use of dolutegravir as an antiretroviral medication was reported to result in increased rates of birth defects where the brain and spinal cord have openings (neural tube defects). Particularly of note was that an HIV infected person on treatment with undetectable virus does not spread it to an uninfected partner.

The 23rd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2020) was held virtually on July 6 to 10, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The theme for the conference was &quot;Resilience.&quot;

The 24th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2022), held both in Montreal and virtually from July 29 to August 2, 2022, centered around the theme &quot;Re-engage and Follow the Science.&quot; At this conference, the Canadian Health Minister announced a significant investment of $17.9 million to enhance HIV testing accessibility, with a specific focus on priority populations in northern, remote, or isolated (NRI) communities within Canada.

=== IAS Conference on HIV Science ===
The IAS also organizes the IAS Conference on HIV Science (abbreviated IAS 2013, IAS 2015 and so on) (formerly called the IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention). This conference, the largest open scientific conference on HIV- and AIDS-related issues, occurs biennially and focuses on the biomedical aspects of HIV. The conference brings together professionals from around the world to examine the latest scientific developments in HIV research, prevention and treatment with a focus on moving science into practice and policy. It was held in Buenos Aires in 2001, Paris in 2003, Rio de Janeiro in 2005, Sydney in 2007, Cape Town in 2009, Rome in 2011, Kuala Lumpur in 2013, Vancouver in 2015, Paris in 2017, Mexico City in 2019, and Brisbane in 2023. The event was held virtually in 2021.

The conference was called the IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention until a name change after 2015.

== Publications and other resources ==
The society financially supports the publication of the &quot;Journal of the International AIDS Society (JIAS)&quot;, an online, open-access, peer-reviewed medical journal covering all aspects of research on HIV and AIDS.

The IAS Online Resource Library is an online collection of abstracts and other resources from international conferences, as well as numerous other materials produced by the IAS launched in January 2010.

== Other activities ==
The IAS works with other regional HIV/AIDS societies and networks to strengthen the capacity of HIV professionals to respond to the epidemic at the regional level. The society runs the Industry Liaison Forum, whose mission is to remove barriers to research investment by the pharmaceutical industry in resource-limited settings. The IAS also provides professional development and training opportunities for HIV professionals at both international and regional AIDS conferences through its education programme.

<doc id="1284864" wikidata="Q492643" url="?curid=1284864" title="Trad jazz">
<text>Trad jazz, short for &quot;traditional jazz&quot;, is a form of jazz in the United States and Britain that flourished from the 1930s to 1960s, based on the earlier New Orleans Dixieland jazz style. Prominent English trad jazz musicians such as Chris Barber, Freddy Randall, Acker Bilk, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer and Monty Sunshine performed a populist repertoire that also included jazz versions of pop songs and nursery rhymes.

==Beginnings of revival==

A Dixieland revival began in the United States on the West Coast in the late 1930s as a backlash to the Chicago style, which was close to swing. Lu Watters and the Yerba Buena Jazz Band, and trombonist Turk Murphy, adopted the repertoire of Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong and W. C. Handy: bands included banjo and tuba in the rhythm sections. A New Orleans–based traditional revival began with the later recordings of Jelly-Roll Morton and the rediscovery of Bunk Johnson in 1942. This revival ultimately led to the founding of Preservation Hall in the French Quarter of New Orleans during the 1960s.

Early King Oliver pieces exemplify this style of hot jazz; however, as individual performers began stepping to the front as soloists, a new form of music emerged. One of the ensemble players in King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, Louis Armstrong, was by far the most influential of the soloists, creating, in his wake, a demand for this &quot;new&quot; style of jazz, in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Other influential stylists who are still revered in traditional jazz circles today include Sidney Bechet, Bix Beiderbecke, Wingy Manone and Muggsy Spanier. Many artists of the big band era, including Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa and Benny Goodman, had their beginnings in trad jazz.

==Britain==
In Britain, where boogie-woogie, &quot;stride&quot; piano and jump blues were popular in the 1940s, George Webb&#x27;s Dixielanders pioneered a trad revival during the Second World War, and Ken Colyer&#x27;s Crane River band added and maintained a strong thread of New Orleans purism. Humphrey Lyttelton, who played with Webb, formed his own band based on the New Orleans/Louis Armstrong tradition in 1948 but, without losing the Armstrong influence, gradually adopted a more mainstream approach. By 1958 his band included three saxophones. During the 1950s and well into the 1960s the &quot;Three B&#x27;s&quot; Chris Barber, Acker Bilk, and Kenny Ball were particularly successful, all making hit records. Other successful bands including Terry Lightfoot, George Chisholm, Monty Sunshine, Mick Mulligan, with George Melly, and Mike Cotton – who &quot;went R&#x27;n&#x27;B&quot; in 1963–1964 – made regular appearances live, on the air and occasionally in the British charts, as did Louis Armstrong himself. More light-hearted versions were offered by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, the Temperance Seven and the New Vaudeville Band. Dixieland stylings can be found here and there on records by the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Small Faces and the Kinks, while the Who actually performed trad jazz in their early days.

In the 1950s a number of provincial amateur bands had strong local followings and occasionally appeared together at &quot;Jazz Jamborees&quot;. These bands included the Merseysippi Jazz Band, still active, which toured overseas, Second City Jazzband (Birmingham), Steel City Stompers (Sheffield), Clyde Valley Stompers (Glasgow), the Tranquil Valley Stompers (London) and the Saints Jazzband (Manchester).

Chris Barber gave a stage to Lonnie Donegan and Alexis Korner, setting off the craze for skiffle and then British rhythm and blues that powered the beat boom of the 1960s

<doc id="1284866" wikidata="Q843356" url="?curid=1284866" title="Deafblindness">
<text>Deafblindness is the condition of little or no useful hearing and little or no useful sight. Different degrees of vision loss and auditory loss occur within each individual. Because of this inherent diversity, each deafblind individual&#x27;s needs regarding lifestyle, communication, education, and work need to be addressed based on their degree of dual-modality deprivation, to improve their ability to live independently. In 1994, an estimated 35,000–40,000 United States residents were medically deafblind. Laura Bridgman was the first American deafblind person known to become well educated. Helen Keller was a well-known example of an educated deafblind individual. To further her lifelong mission to help the deafblind community to expand its horizons and gain opportunities, the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults (also called the Helen Keller National Center or HKNC), with a residential training program in Sands Point, New York, was established in 1967 by an act of Congress.

The deafblind community has its own culture, comparable to those of the Deaf community. Members of the deafblind community have diverse backgrounds but are united by similar experiences and a shared, homogeneous understanding of what it means to be deafblind. Some deafblind individuals view their condition as a part of their identity.

== Epidemiology ==

The medical condition of deafblindness occurs in different forms. For some, this condition might happen congenitally from birth as a result of genetic defect, for others it happens suddenly due to a form of illness or accident that results in a modality deprivation of either vision or hearing, or both. A person might be born deaf and become blind at a later stage in life, or vice versa. In any given case of deafblindness, many possible onsets and causes of this condition exist; some happen gradually, others happen unexpectedly and suddenly. The diagnosis of deafblindness could be medically classified into specific types based on one&#x27;s symptoms and causes.

The two overarching types of deafblindness are congenital and acquired.

Congenital deafblindness: the condition of deafblindness from birth
* Pregnancy complexities
** Effects of alcohol/drugs
*** Fetal alcohol syndrome
** A result of prematurity
** Causes from illness/infection
*** Rubella
*** AIDS
*** Cytomegalovirus
*** Congenital syphilis
*** Toxoplasmosis
* Genetic conditions (evident from birth)
** Anomalies/syndromes (numerous genetic defects may contribute to one&#x27;s medical condition of deafblindness, of which some of more well-known syndromes are listed)
***CHARGE syndrome
***Cochleosaccular degeneration with progressive cataracts
*** Down syndrome
*** Marshall syndrome
*** Congenital rubella syndrome
*** Stickler syndrome
*** Trisomy 13
Acquired deafblindness: condition of deafblindness developed later in life
* Genetic conditions (evident at a later stage in life)
**Usher syndrome
** Alport syndrome
* Age-related loss of modality (vision or auditory or both)
* Illness, such as meningitis
* Somatic injuries
**Brain damage/trauma
** Stroke
** Permanent physical damage (relating to vision or hearing)

== Communication ==

Deafblind people communicate in many different ways as determined by the nature of their condition, the age of onset, and what resources are available to them. For example, someone who grew up deaf and experienced vision loss later in life is likely to use a sign language (in a visually modified or tactile form). Others who grew up blind and later became deaf are more likely to use a tactile mode of spoken/written language. Methods of communication include:

* Use of residual hearing (speaking clearly, hearing aids, or cochlear implants) or sight (signing within a restricted visual field, writing with large print)
* Tactile signing, sign language, or a manual alphabet such as the American Manual Alphabet or Deaf-blind Alphabet (also known as &quot;two-hand manual&quot;) with tactile or visual modifications
* Interpreting services (such as sign-language interpreters or communication aides)
* Communication devices such as Tellatouch or its computerized versions known as the TeleBraille and Screen Braille Communicator.
* Tadoma, a tactile modality
* Square script, a method of writing along tactile guidelines
* Protactile, a tactile language related to American Sign Language in the Francosign language family

Multisensory methods have been used to help deafblind people enhance their communication skills. These can be taught to very young children with developmental delays (to help with pre-intentional communication), young people with learning difficulties, and older people, including those with dementia. One such process is Tacpac.

Deafblind people often use the assistance of people known as support-service providers (SSPs), who help the deafblind with tasks such as routine errands, guiding the deafblind through unfamiliar environments, and facilitating communication between the deafblind person and another person.

==Technology==

A graphic Braille display can be used in sensing graphic data such as maps, images, and text data that require multiline display capabilities such spreadsheets and equations. Graphic braille displays available in the market are DV-2 (from KGS), Hyperbraille, and TACTISPLAY Table/Walk (from Tactisplay Corp.). For example, TACTISPLAY Table can show 120*100 resolution refreshable braille graphics on one page.

==In popular culture==
The play &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1959), which was adapted into the film &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1962), recounts Anne Sullivan&#x27;s efforts to draw Helen Keller from her world of blindness and deafness.

The Who’s album &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) tells one continuous life story about a deafblind mute boy named Tommy through songs.

The Bollywood film &quot;Black&quot; (2005) featured Rani Mukerji as a deafblind character named Michelle McNally.

The film &quot;Marie&#x27;s Story&quot; (2014) relates the childhood and education of Marie Heurtin (1885–1921), a deafblind woman.

Haben Girma, the first deafblind individual to graduate from Harvard Law School, released an autobiography entitled &quot;&quot; (2019).

&quot;Feeling Through&quot; (2019) is an American short drama film directed by Doug Roland that was the first film ever to star a deafblind actor (Robert Tarango) in a lead role; it is about a teenager and a deafblind man. It was nominated for the 2021 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.

&quot;The Persistence of Vision&quot; is a 1978 novella by John Varley describing the life of a blind-and-deaf community.

== Overview ==
The bridge is 30.25 m wide, 705 m long and has a bridge surface of 21,326 m2. The highest point above ground is 60 m. It consists completely of a steelwork construction, whose rolling-element bearing rests on concrete pillars. In contrast to similar bridges, the roadways of both driving directions are carried by continuous elements. Construction of the bridge was completed in 1971.

==Damage and closure==

At 10:40 on 26 August 2004 a car, whose driver was not holding a license, collided with a tanker truck containing 32,000 liters of fuel on the Wiehltal Bridge. The guard rails were designed only to stop vehicles up to 13 tons and were unable to hold the truck, which fell 30 meters off the A 4 Autobahn and exploded. The truck driver was killed; the heat damage destroyed the load-bearing ability of the bridge and it had to be closed to traffic.

Provisional repairs were made in autumn 2004. Plans for a replacement bridge were expected to be formulated in the spring of 2005. Repairs are estimated at and replacement could cost up to , including the cost for disposing of the waste. This was by far the most expensive accident in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.

==Repair and reopening==
The bridge was repaired and re-opened to traffic on 18 October 2007.

<text>Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg (; ; 30 November 1802 – 24 January 1872) was a German philosopher and philologist.

==Life==
He was born at Eutin, near Lübeck. He was placed in a gymnasium in Eutin, which was under the direction of , a philologist influenced by Immanuel Kant.

He was educated at the universities of Kiel, Leipzig, Berlin. He became more and more attracted to the study of Plato and Aristotle, and his 1826 doctoral dissertation, &quot;Platonis de ideis et numeris doctrina ex Aristotele illustrata&quot; (&quot;On Plato&#x27;s Doctrine of Ideas and Numbers as Illustrated by Aristotle&quot;), was an attempt to reach through Aristotle&#x27;s criticisms a more accurate knowledge of the Platonic philosophy.

He declined the offer of a classical chair at Kiel, and accepted a post as tutor to the son of an intimate friend of Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein, the Prussian minister of education. He held this position for seven years (1826–1833), occupying his leisure time with the preparation of a critical edition of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De anima&quot; (1833; 2nd ed. by Christian Belger, 1877). In 1833 Altenstein appointed Trendelenburg extraordinary professor in Berlin, and four years later he was advanced to an ordinary professorship.

==Teaching==
For nearly 40 years, he proved himself markedly successful as a teacher, during the greater part of which time he had to examine in philosophy and pedagogics all candidates for the profession in Prussia. His teaching method was highly regarded by Søren Kierkegaard who called him &quot;one of the most sober philosophical philologists I know.&quot; He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1861. Two of his prominent students were Franz Brentano and Wilhelm Dilthey.

==Philosophical work==

===Defense of teleology===
Trendelenburg&#x27;s philosophizing is conditioned throughout by his loving study of Plato and Aristotle, whom he regards not as opponents but as building jointly on the broad basis of idealism. His own standpoint may be called a modern version of Aristotelianism. While denying the possibility of an absolute method and an absolute philosophy, as contended for by Hegel and others, Trendelenburg was emphatically an idealist in the ancient or Platonic sense; his whole work was devoted to the demonstration of the ideal in the real. But he maintained that the procedure of philosophy must be analytic, rising from the particular facts to the universal in which we find them explained. We divine the system of the whole from the part we know, but the process of reconstruction must remain approximative. Our position forbids the possibility of a final system. Instead, therefore, of constantly beginning afresh in speculation, it should be our duty to attach ourselves to what may be considered the permanent results of historic developments.

The classical expression of these results Trendelenburg finds mainly in the Platonico-Aristotelian system. The philosophical question is stated thus: How are thought and being united in knowledge? How does thought get at being? And how does being enter into thought? Proceeding on the principle that like can only be known by like, Trendelenburg next reaches a doctrine peculiar to himself (though based upon Aristotle) that plays a central part in his speculations. Motion is the fundamental fact common to being and thought; the &quot;actual motion&quot; of the external world has its counterpart in the &quot;constructive motion&quot; involved in every instance of perception or thought. From motion he proceeds to deduce time, space and the categories of mechanics and natural science. These, being thus derived, are at once subjective and objective in their scope. It is true that matter can never be completely resolved into motion, but the irreducible remainder may be treated, like Aristotle, as an abstraction we asymptotically approach but never reach.

The facts of existence, however, are not adequately explained by the mechanical categories. The ultimate interpretation of the universe can only be found in the higher category of End or final cause. Here Trendelenburg finds the dividing line, between philosophical systems. On the one side stand those that acknowledge none but efficient causes, which make force prior to thought, and explain the universe, as it were, &quot;a tergo&quot; (&quot;from the back&quot;). This may be called, typically, Democritism. On the other side stands the organic or teleological view of the world, which interprets the parts through the idea of the whole, and sees in the efficient causes only the vehicle of ideal ends. This may be called in a wide sense Platonism. Systems like Spinozism, which seem to form a third class, neither sacrificing force to thought nor thought to force, yet by their denial of final causes inevitably fall back into the Democritic or essentially materialistic standpoint, leaving us with the great antagonism of the mechanical and the organic systems of philosophy. The latter view, which receives its first support in the facts of life, or organic nature as such, finds its culmination and ultimate verification in the ethical world, which essentially consists in the realization of ends.

Trendelenburg&#x27;s &quot;Naturrecht&quot; [the right of nature] may, therefore, be taken as in a manner the completion of his system, his working out of the ideal as present in the real. The ethical end is taken to be the idea of humanity, not in the abstract as formulated by Immanuel Kant, but in the context of the state and of history. Law is treated throughout as the vehicle of ethical requirements. In Trendelenburg&#x27;s treatment of the state, as the ethical organism in which the individual (the potential man) may be said first to emerge into actuality, we may trace his nurture on the best ideas of Hellenic antiquity.

===Fischer–Trendelenburg debate===
In 1865 he became involved in an acrimonious controversy on the interpretation of Kant&#x27;s doctrine of space with Kuno Fischer, whom he attacked in &quot;Kuno Fischer und sein Kant&quot; (1869), which drew forth the reply &quot;Anti-Trendelenburg&quot; (1870). The controversy became known in the history of philosophy as the Fischer–Trendelenburg debate.

Trendelenburg&#x27;s position on the debate (the position that &quot;Kant may establish that space and time are &quot;a priori&quot; and intuitive conditions for experience in the &quot;Transcendental Aesthetic,&quot; but this in no way entails that space and time have nothing to do with the objects outside of possible experience&quot;) has been variously dubbed as &quot;Neglected Alternative,&quot; &quot;Trendelenburg&#x27;s gap&quot; [&quot;die trendelenburgische Lücke&quot;], &quot;Pistorius&#x27;s gap [&quot;die pistorische Lücke&quot;]&quot; (named after Hermann Andreas Pistorius), or &quot;third possibility&quot; [&quot;die dritte Möglichkeit&quot;].

==Family==
His son, Friedrich Trendelenburg, was a prominent surgeon; several medical techniques and matters are named for him.

<text>The Weihe Viaduct (German: &quot;Weihetalbrücke&quot;, also known as &quot;Talbrücke Richelsdorf&quot;) is a motorway bridge on the Bundesautobahn 4 (A 4) near Richelsdorf, Germany. The bridge is located between the eastbound and westbound exits for Gerstungen on the route between Bad Hersfeld (Hesse) and Eisenach (Thuringia). 

It is a prestressed concrete bridge with a length of 584 m, and rests on eight columns. It crosses the valley of the small river Weihe.

==History==
The construction of the bridge had been planned since the beginning of the 1940s. Construction began but halted, leaving only a few columns built. This was due to its location near the former border between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Instead, a provisional route through the valley was constructed for the motorway. 

After the 1990 German reunification, traffic increased considerably, and in 1992 construction of a new bridge was started. The new bridge cost 45 million DM and was inaugurated in 1994. It was opened to traffic in 1995. Two of the old columns were kept as a monument.

<doc id="1284877" wikidata="Q1253235" url="?curid=1284877" title="Christmas in the Philippines">
<text>In the Philippines, Christmas (; ) is a major annual celebration, as in most countries of the Christian world. It is celebrated as a public holiday in the country on December 25, concurrent with other countries.

As one of the two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia (the other one being East Timor), the Philippines celebrates the world&#x27;s longest Christmas season (), spanning what it refers to as the &quot;ber months&quot;. With Christmas music played as early as August, the holiday season gradually begins by September, reaches its peak in December during Christmastide, and concludes within the week after New Year&#x27;s Day; however, festivities may last until the third Sunday of January, the feast day of the Santo Niño. Liturgically, the Christmas season is observed by the Catholic Church from the first day of Advent (the fourth Sunday before Christmas) to Three Kings&#x27; Day, which falls on the Sunday between January 2 and 8.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
In Filipino and other Philippine languages, the word &quot;paskó&quot; commonly refers to Christmas. It comes from the Spanish phrase &quot;pascua de navidad&quot; (); the latter part, &quot;de navidad&quot;, fell out of use, leaving the word &quot;pascua&quot; to be assimilated into the local languages over the years. Meanwhile, the Spanish word &quot;pascua&quot; is descended from Latin &quot;pascha&quot;, which was borrowed from Ancient Greek πάσχα (&quot;páskha&quot;), meaning &quot;Passover&quot;. In other languages spoken in the country, including Chavacano (a Spanish-based creole), Hiligaynon, and Ilocano, the Spanish-derived word &quot;pascua&quot; is still in use, although its spelling may vary. In Kapampangan, &quot;Pasku&quot; (also spelled &quot;Pascu&quot;), a word related to Tagalog &quot;Paskó&quot;, is used. &quot;Krismas&quot;, a Filipinized rendering of the English word &quot;Christmas&quot;, is also used occasionally in non-formal contexts.

The word &quot;Paskó&quot; serves as the root word of some Christmas-related terms, such as &quot;Kapaskuhán&quot;, the name for the Christmas season; &quot;namamaskó&quot;, a caroller; &quot;pamamaskó&quot;, the act of caroling; &quot;pamaskó&quot;, a Christmas gift or present; and &quot;pampaskó&quot;, or &quot;pang-Paskó&quot;, which literally means &quot;for Christmas&quot; and may refer to clothing worn on the day of the holiday.
Add to this, pamamasko is the act of Christian children going from house to house greeting Christmas cheers their relatives or friends and asking Christmas gifts whether in cash or in kind. It is the time after they went to church on every Christmas morning.

==History==
The celebrations of Christmas in the Philippines have deep influences of Catholicism, tracing their roots back to Spanish colonial rule from 1521 to 1898. Currently, the Philippines holds the longest running festivity of the Christmas season in the world, which begins on September 1.

==Activities==
The various ethnic groups in the Philippines observe different Christmas traditions, and the following are generally common.

== Christmas traditions ==

===Simbang Gabi and Misa de Gallo===

 (&quot;Night Mass&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Misa de Gallo&quot;, &quot;Rooster&#x27;s Mass&quot;, or , &quot;Gift Mass&quot;) is a novena of dawn Masses from December 16 to 24 (Christmas Eve). The &quot;Simbang Gabi&quot; is practiced mainly by Catholics and Aglipayans, with some Evangelical Christian and independent Protestant churches having adopted the practise of pre-Christmas dawn services. Attending the Masses is meant to show devotion to God and heightened anticipation for Christ&#x27;s birth, and folk belief holds that God grants the special wish of a devotee who hears all nine Masses.

Morning observance of during this holiday begins, typically at 04:00, or as early as 02:30 or as late as 05:00 or even 06:00 (or rarely, 06:30) PST, while in some parishes, some churches and others, anticipated Masses begin the previous evening at 20:00 PST, or as early as 16:00 or as late as 21:00 PST or even 22:00 PST. After hearing Mass, Catholic families buy traditional Filipino holiday fare for breakfast outside the church and eat it either within the church precincts or at home. Vendors offer many native delicacies, including &quot;bibingka&quot; (rice flour and egg-based cake, cooked using coal burners above and under); &quot;putò bumbóng&quot; (a purple, sticky rice delicacy steamed in bamboo tubes, buttered then sprinkled with brown sugar and shredded dried coconut meat). Drinks include coffee, &quot;salabát&quot; (ginger tea) and &quot;tsokolate&quot; (thick, Spanish-style hot chocolate). Some Aglipayan churches invite the congregation to partake of the &quot;paínit&quot; (literally, &quot;heater&quot;), a post-Mass snack of mostly rice pastries served with coffee or cocoa at the house of the Mass sponsor. The &quot;bibingka&quot; and &quot;putò bumbóng&quot; are also served to those attending the anticipated evening Masses together with dinner.

=== Christmas Eve ===
For Catholic Filipinos, Christmas Eve (&quot;&quot;; ) on December 24 is celebrated with the Midnight Mass, and the traditional &quot;Noche Buena&quot; (Filipino Spanish &quot;Good Night&quot;) feast. Family members dine together at around midnight. Some families would also open presents at this time.

====&quot;Noche Buena&quot;====

The Christmas dinner eaten around midnight on Christmas Eve is known as &quot;Noche Buena&quot; (not to be confused with the New Year&#x27;s Eve dinner known as &quot;Medianoche&quot;).

Popular beverages are &quot;tsokolate&quot; as well as coffee, soda, wine, beer, alcoholic drinks, and fruit juices.

====&quot;Panunulúyan&quot;====

In different provinces and schools, the journey of Joseph and the pregnant Virgin Mary in search of lodging is re-enacted. The pageant, traditionally called the &quot;&quot;Panunulúyan&quot;, &quot;Pananawágan&quot;, or &quot;Pananapátan&quot;&quot;, is modeled after the Spanish &quot;Las Posadas&quot;.

The &quot;Panunulúyan&quot; is performed after dark, with the actors portraying Joseph and the Virgin Mary going to pre-designated houses. They perform a chant meant to rouse the &quot;owners of the house&quot; (also actors) to request for lodging. The owners then cruelly turn them away, sometimes also in song, saying that their house is already filled with other guests. Finally, Joseph and Mary make their way to the parish church where a replica of the stable is set up. The birth of Jesus is celebrated at midnight with the &quot;Misa de Gallo&quot;.

===Christmas Day===

Christmas Day in the Philippines is primarily a family affair. The &quot;Misa de Gallo&quot; is celebrated on December 25 and is usually one of several Masses that all family members (including non-churchgoers) are present and is often celebrated between 10 pm and midnight, a schedule preferred by many Filipinos who stay up late on Christmas Eve for the night-long celebration of the &quot;Noche Buena&quot;. Fireworks and most merrymaking devices are sometimes used at the start of Christmas.

Preferably in the morning, Filipinos typically visit their extended family, especially to pay their respects to senior relatives. This custom of giving respect is enacted through the &quot;Págmamáno&quot;. A supplicant takes the back of an elder&#x27;s hand and presses it against the forehead while giving the greeting, &quot;Máno, pô&quot; (lit. &quot;[Thy] hand, please&quot;). The elder often responds by reciting a blessing or simply acknowledging the gesture, and in return gives &quot;&quot;Aguinaldo&quot; or money in the form of crisp banknotes, often placed in a sealed envelope such as an &quot;ang pao&quot;. Godparents, in particular, are socially obligated to give presents or &quot;aguinaldo&quot; to their godchildren, to whom they often give larger amounts compared to other younger relatives.

A festive lunch may follow the &quot;Págmamáno&quot;&quot;. The menu is heavily dependent upon the finances of the family, with richer families preparing grand feasts while poorer families choose to cook simple yet special dishes. Some families choose to open presents on this day after the lunch.

When nighttime falls, members of the family usually return home or linger to drink, play parlor games, and chat. Some may opt to have another feast for dinner, while a minority spend the entire day at home to rest after the previous days&#x27; festivities. Filipinos do hang out with family and friends at the park or plaza with illuminating colorful lights and giant Christmas tree or shopping to buy for a gifts and dine in at the malls.

===&quot;Niños Inocentes&quot;===
Holy Innocents&#x27; Day or Childermas is commemorated on December 28 as . Filipinos once celebrated the day by playing practical jokes on one another, similar to April Fool&#x27;s Day. One of the widely practiced pranks on this day is to borrow money without the intention of paying back. Creditors are usually helpless in getting remuneration from borrower, and are instead forewarned not to lend money on this day. Victims of such pranks were once called out, &quot;Na-Niños Inocentes ka!&quot;

===New Year&#x27;s Eve===

On December 31 (), Filipino families gather for the a lavish midnight feast that supposedly symbolizes their hopes for prosperity in the coming year, and lasts until the following morning as with the Noche Buena taken on Christmas Eve.

Filipinos make noise both to greet the New Year and in the belief that the din exorcises their surroundings of malevolent spirits. In spite of the yearly ban (due to the national government restrictions), people in most towns and cities customarily light firecrackers, or employ safer methods of merrymaking such as banging on pots and pans and blowing car horns.

Other traditions and beliefs include encouraging children to jump at the stroke of midnight to increase their height; displaying circular fruit such as oranges; wearing clothes with dots and other circular designs to symbolize coins and money; eating twelve grapes at midnight for good luck in the twelve months of the year (a Spanish custom); and opening all windows and doors to let in the blessings on the first day of the year.

===Three Kings&#x27; Day===
Christmas officially ends on the Feast of the Epiphany, more commonly known as Three Kings&#x27; Day (; ), which falls on the first Sunday after New Year&#x27;s Day.

A dying tradition is the Hispanic custom of children leaving their shoes out by the window or the door, so that the Three Kings can leave small gifts like candy or money inside upon their descent on Twelfth Night.

===Feast of the Black Nazarene===

The Black Nazarene, whose devotees are primarily centered in Manila and Cagayan de Oro, is borne in procession on January 9 after a novena in its honor. The date commemorates the image&#x27;s 1787 &quot;Traslación&quot; (solemn transfer) from its original location in what is now Rizal Park to its present shrine in the Quiapo District of the city.

===Feast of the Santo Niño===
The latest date for the end of popular Christmas celebrations is the Feast of the &quot;Santo Niño&quot; (Christ Child) on the third Sunday of January. The image depiction most associated with this day is the purportedly miraculous Santo Niño de Cebú, the first Christian icon brought to the islands. In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan came to Cebú and gave the image as a present to Humamay, chief consort of the local monarch, Raja Humabon, when she, together with her husband and a number of his subjects, were baptized into the Catholic faith. Tradition holds that Humamay—who received the Christian name &quot;Juana&quot; after Joan of Castile—danced for joy upon receiving the &quot;Santo Niño&quot;, providing a legendary origin for the fervent religious dancing during the &quot;Sinulog&quot; held in honor of the Christ Child. Celebrations are mostly focused in Cebu, where the Sinulog Festival is held, while there are other celebrations held nationwide in its honor, including the Ati-Atihan Festival in Aklan Province, the Dinagyang in Iloilo, the Kahimunan in Butuan, and the feasts of the Holy Child in the districts of Tondo and Pandacan in Manila. The National Cathedral or the Central Church of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente or Aglipayans is dedicated to the Santo Niño and other several parishes and missions around the country.

===The Feast of Our Lady of the Candles===
In older traditions (which are still kept in the liturgical calendar of the Extraordinary Form of the Mass) Christmas lasted until Candlemas, or the Feast of the Purification of Mary and the Presentation of the Baby Jesus at the Temple. This marked the end of a long 40-day &quot;Christmastide&quot; corresponding to the 40 days of Lent. This date falls on February 2, after Mary had participated in a rite of purification in according to the ancient Candlemas festival rooted in Halakha (Jewish law). This is also when Simeon makes his well-known prophecy to Mary and Joseph about the Holy Child, of Jesus being a light for the Gentiles. Many parishes, if possible will still keep their nativity scenes displayed up until the celebration of the Presentation of the Lord on February 2.

This final salvo is marked by the Feast of Our Lady of the Candles in Jaro, Iloilo City, where the image is enshrined in the Jaro Cathedral, the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Candles, where Tridentine Masses are celebrated in commemoration. Similar celebrations are held nationwide in towns where Our Lady of the Candles is its patroness, including Candelaria, Quezon, whose town fiesta is celebrated on this date.

==Decorations==
Due to secularization, decorations such as Santa Claus, Christmas trees, tinsel, faux evergreens, reindeer, and snow have become popular. Christmas lights are strung about in festoons, as the tail of the Star of Bethlehem in &quot;Belens&quot;, star shapes, Christmas trees, angels, and in a large variety of other ways, going as far as draping the whole outside of the house in lights. Despite these, the Philippines still retains its traditional decorations.

===&quot;Paról&quot;===
Every Christmas season, Filipino homes and buildings are adorned with star-shaped lanterns, called &quot;paról&quot; from the Spanish &quot;farol&quot;, meaning &quot;lantern&quot; or &quot;lamp&quot;. These lanterns represent the Star of Bethlehem that guided the magi, also known as the Three Kings (Tagalog: &quot;Tatlóng Harì&quot;). Paról are as beloved and iconic to Filipinos as Christmas trees are to Westerners.

The most common form of the lantern is a 5-pointed star with two &quot;tails&quot; at the lower two tips. Other popular variations are four, eight, and ten-pointed stars, while rarer ones sport six, seven, nine, and more than twelve points. The earliest paróls were made from simple materials like bamboo, Japanese rice paper (known as &quot;papél de Hapón&quot;) or crêpe paper, and were lit by a candle or coconut oil lamp. Simple paróls can be easily constructed with just ten bamboo sticks, paper, and glue. Present-day paról has endless possible shapes and forms and is made of a variety of materials, such as cellophane, plastic, rope, capiz shell, glass, and even recycled refuse. Paról-making is a folk craft, and many Filipino children often craft them as a school project or for leisure.

The Giant Lantern Festival is an annual festival held the Saturday before Christmas Eve in San Fernando, Pampanga. The festival features a competition of giant lanterns, and the popularity of the festival has earned the city the moniker, &quot;Christmas Capital of the Philippines.&quot;

===&quot;Belén&quot;===

Another traditional Filipino Christmas symbol is the &quot;belén&quot;—a creche or tableau depicting the Birth of Christ. Derived from the Spanish name for Bethlehem, &quot;Belén&quot;, it depicts the infant Jesus in the manger, surrounded by the Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, the shepherds, their flock, the Magi and some stable animals, and is surmounted by an angel, the Star or both.

&quot;Belén&quot; were introduced by the Spanish since the 16th century. They are an ubiquitous and iconic Christmas symbol in the Philippines, on par with the parol (Christmas lanterns depicting the Star of Bethlehem) which are often incorporated into the scene as the source of illumination. Both the &quot;Belén&quot; and the &quot;parol&quot; were the traditional Christmas decorations in Filipino homes before Americans introduced the Christmas tree. Most churches in the Philippines also transform their altars into a &quot;Belén&quot; at Christmas. They are also found in schools (which also hold nativity plays), government buildings, commercial establishments, and in public spaces.

&quot;Belén&quot; can be seen in homes, churches, schools and even office buildings; the ones on office buildings can be extravagant, using different materials for the figures and using Christmas lights, &quot;parol&quot;s for the Star, and painted background scenery. A notable outdoor belén in Metro Manila is the one that used to be at the Manila COD department store building in Avenida Rizal in Manila from 1952 until the store and display itself was relocated to Cubao, Quezon City in 1966. In 2003, the &quot;belén&quot; was transferred to the Greenhills Shopping Center in San Juan when the COD building closed down in 2002. The last known display in Greenhills was held from November 2016 to January 2017, before returning to Cubao in 2018 at the Times Square Park. This &quot;belén&quot; is a lights and sounds presentation, the story being narrated over speakers set up and most probably using automatons to make the figures move up and down, or turn, etc. Each year, the company owning it changes the theme from the Nativity Story, with variations such as a fairground story, and Santa Claus&#x27; journey.

Tarlac City, Tarlac is known as the &quot;&quot;Belén&quot; Capital of the Philippines&quot; holds the annual &quot;Belenísmo sa Tarlac&quot;. It is a &quot;belén&quot;-making contest which is participated by establishments and residents in Tarlac. Giant versions of the &quot;belén&quot; with different themes are displayed in front of the establishments and roads of Tarlac for the entire season.

==Caroling==
In the Philippines, children in small groups go from house to house singing Christmas carols, which they called &quot;pangangaroling&quot;. Makeshift instruments include tambourines made with &quot;tansan&quot;s (aluminum bottle caps) strung on a piece of wire. With the traditional chant of &quot;Namamasko po!&quot;, these carolers wait expectantly for the homeowners to reward them with coins. Afterward, the carolers thank the generous homeowners by singing &quot;Thank you, thank you, &quot;ang babait ninyo&quot; (you are so kind), thank you!&quot;

An example of a traditional Filipino carol is a part of a series known as &quot;Maligayang Pasko&quot;, which is commonly called &quot;Sa maybahay ang aming bati&quot;. The tradition of carols stems from the long years of Spanish rule, in which traditions practiced in Spanish Latin America during this time of the year were adopted to suit Philippine conditions.

==Aguinaldo==
This is a word heard repeatedly during the Christmas Season in the Philippines. Presently, the term is interpreted as gift or money received from benefactors. &quot;Aguinaldo&quot; is a Spanish term for bonus. Its prevalent use may have originated from Filipino workers of the Spanish era, receiving extra pay from the generosity of the rich employers during the celebration of the Christmas season.

==Rice cakes ==
Several rice cakes often sold outside churches during Simbang Gabi, providing a warm, sweet treat in the early morning hours.

* Puto bumbong has a distinctive purple color which comes naturally from a sticky rice called “pirurutong”
* Bibingka is made from rice flour, coconut milk, and water, which are poured into a clay pot lined with banana leaves
* Puto is made from mixing fermented rice with yeast overnight to create a dough which is then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed to create small, puffy, rounded cakes.
* Kutsinta, looking like a rounded piece of toffee, is made by steaming a mix of rice flour, tapioca, brown sugar, and lye, which is then colored with yellow food coloring or annatto tree extract

==Songs ==
The song &quot;Christmas in Our Hearts&quot;, released by Jose Mari Chan in 1990, has become the most famous song for Christmas in the Philippines. It is synonymous with the start of the Christmas season, often played in homes, shopping malls, and on radio stations as early as September.

==Countdowns ==
For Filipinos in the Philippines and abroad, the countdown to Christmas gradually begins by September, reaching its peak in December, and concludes at midnight between December 24 (Christmas Eve) and December 25 (Christmas Day).

<text>The Wommen Viaduct is an arch bridge built between 1938 and 1940 near Wommen, Germany, as part of the Reichsautobahn system. It is a 26.5 metres (87 ft) tall and 303.8 metres (997 ft) long motorway bridge on the Bundesautobahn 4. Because of World War II, it was left half-finished, and because of the German division the one completed side was closed until 1990. After German reunification, it was completed in 1993 with a new bridge for the second lane.

<text>Michael Strogoff: The Courier of the Czar () is a novel written by Jules Verne in 1876. Critic Leonard S. Davidow, considers it one of Verne&#x27;s best books. Davidow wrote, &quot;Jules Verne has written no better book than this, in fact it is deservedly ranked as one of the most thrilling tales ever written.&quot; Unlike some of Verne&#x27;s other novels, it is not science fiction, but its plot device is a scientific phenomenon (Leidenfrost effect). The book was later adapted to a play, by Verne himself and Adolphe d&#x27;Ennery. Incidental music to the play was written by Alexandre Artus in 1880 and by Franz von Suppé in 1893. The book has been adapted several times for films, television and cartoon series.

== Plot summary ==
Michael Strogoff, a 30-year-old native of Omsk, is a courier for Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The Tartar khan (prince), Feofar Khan, incites a rebellion and separates the Russian Far East from the mainland, severing telegraph lines. Rebels encircle Irkutsk, where the local governor, a brother of the Tsar, is making a last stand. Strogoff is sent to Irkutsk to warn the governor about the traitor Ivan Ogareff, a former colonel, who was once demoted and exiled by this brother of the Tsar. He now seeks revenge: he intends to gain the governor&#x27;s trust and then betray him and Irkutsk to the Tartar hordes.

On his way to Irkutsk, Strogoff meets Nadia Fedor, daughter of an exiled political prisoner, Basil Fedor, who has been granted permission to join her father at his exile in Irkutsk; the English war correspondent Harry Blount of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;; and Alcide Jolivet, a Frenchman reporting for his &quot;cousin Madeleine&quot; (presumably, for some unnamed French paper). Blount and Jolivet tend to follow the same route as Michael, separating and meeting again all the way through Siberia. He is supposed to travel under a false identity, posing as the pacific merchant Nicolas Korpanoff, but he is discovered by the Tartars when he meets his mother in their home city of Omsk.

Michael, his mother and Nadia are eventually captured by the Tartar forces, along with thousands of other Russians, during the storming of a city in the Ob River basin. The Tartars do not know Strogoff by sight, but Ogareff is aware of the courier&#x27;s mission and when he is told that Strogoff&#x27;s mother spotted her son in the crowd and called his name, but received no reply, he understands that Strogoff is among the captured and devises a scheme to force the mother to indicate him. Strogoff is indeed caught and handed over to the Tartars, and Ogareff alleges that Michael is a spy, hoping to have him put to death in some cruel way. After opening the Koran at random, Feofar decides that Michael will be blinded as punishment in the Tartar fashion, with a glowing hot blade. For several chapters the reader is led to believe that Michael was indeed blinded, but it transpires in fact that he was saved from this fate (his tears at his mother evaporated and saved his corneas) and was only pretending.

Eventually, Michael and Nadia escape, and travel to Irkutsk with a friendly peasant, Nicolas Pigassof. They are recaptured by the Tartars; Nicolas witnesses Nadia cruelly insulted by a Tartar soldier and murders Nadia&#x27;s assaulter. The Tartars then abandon Nadia and Michael and carry Nicolas away, reserving him for a greater punishment. Nadia and Michael later discover him buried up to his neck in the ground; after he dies they bury him hastily and continue onwards with great difficulty. However, they eventually reach Irkutsk, and warn the Tsar&#x27;s brother in time of Ivan Ogareff. Nadia&#x27;s father has been appointed commander of a suicide battalion of exiles, who are all pardoned; he joins Nadia and Michael; some days later they are married.

== Sources of information ==
Exact sources of Verne&#x27;s quite accurate knowledge of contemporary Eastern Siberia remain disputed. One popular version connects it to the novelist&#x27;s meetings with anarchist Peter Kropotkin; however, Kropotkin arrived in France after &quot;Strogoff&quot; was published. Another, more likely source, could have been Siberian businessman Mikhail Sidorov. Sidorov presented his collection of natural resources, including samples of oil and oil shales from Ukhta area, together with photographs of Ukhta oil wells, at the 1873 World Exhibition in Vienna, where he could have met Verne. Real-world oil deposits in Lake Baikal region do exist, first discovered in 1902 in Barguzin Bay and Selenge River delta, but they are nowhere near the commercial size depicted by Verne.

Verne&#x27;s publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel sent the manuscript of the novel to the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev in August 1875 asking him for his comments on the accuracy of the conditions described in the book.

While the physical description of Siberia is accurate, the Tartar rebellion described was not a rebellion and the strength as well as the geographical reach of the Tartars is highly exaggerated, although there had been one sizeable insurrection under Isatay Taymanuly in 1836–38 and a major uprising against Russia led by Kenesary Kasymuly between 1837 and 1847. After the Khanates had been gradually pushed back further South earlier in the 19th century, between 1865 and 1868 Russia had conquered the weakened Central Asian Uzbek Khanates of Kokand and Bukhara, both located much further South than the cities through which Strogoff travelled in the novel. While there thus had been war between Russia and &quot;Tartars&quot; a few years before Jules Verne wrote &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot;, no Tartar khan at the time was in a position to act as Feofar is described as doing; depicting late 19th-century Tartars as able to face Russians on anything resembling equal terms is an anachronism.

== Musical adaptations ==
* &quot;La guerra santa&quot;, three-act zarzuela by Emilio Arrieta, text by Luis Mariano de Larra and , (Madrid, 1879) is an adaptation of Verne&#x27;s novel
* &quot;Michel Strogoff&quot;, musical by Jack Ledru, text by Henri Varna (Paris, 1963)

== Screen adaptations ==
The town of Marfa, Texas was named after the character Marfa Strogoff in this novel.

== Boardgame ==
In 2017 a board game was published by Devir Games, designed by Alberto Corral and developed and illustrated by Pedro Soto. Similar to the book, in the game players are couriers racing across Russia to thwart the assassination plot by Count Ivan Ogareff. Players will race one another but will also race the Count, who moves across Russia on a separate track. Along the way, players must face and overcome troubles such as bears and bad weather, avoid the spy Sangarra who tries to delay their progress, and avoid capture by the Tartar forces who conspire with Count Ogareff. Players must balance the racing element of the game, resting enough to preserve health, and dealing with the troubles they face along the way before crisis ensues. The game usually ends when a player confronts Ogareff in Irkutsk and a showdown ensues. The game is highly thematic and true to the novel, with artwork that draws on traditional Russian carving techniques from the era.

<text>Friedrich Trendelenburg (; ; 24 May 184415 December 1924) was a German surgeon. He was son of the philosopher Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg, father of the pharmacologist Paul Trendelenburg and grandfather of the pharmacologist Ullrich Georg Trendelenburg.

Trendelenburg was born in Berlin and studied medicine at the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh. He completed his studies at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin under Bernhard von Langenbeck, receiving his doctorate in 1866. He practiced medicine at the University of Rostock and the University of Bonn. In 1895 he became surgeon-in-chief at the University of Leipzig.

Trendelenburg was interested in the history of surgery. He founded the German Surgical Society in 1872. Trendelenburg was also interested in the surgical removal of pulmonary emboli. His student Martin Kirschner performed the first successful pulmonary embolectomy in 1924, shortly before Trendelenburg&#x27;s death. He died in 1924 of cancer of the mandible, aged 80.

==Named after Friedrich Trendelenburg==
A number of medical treatments and terminologies have been named after Friedrich Trendelenburg, including:
* Brodie–Trendelenburg percussion test (also accredited to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie) is a test for incompetent valves in superficial veins.
* Trendelenburg&#x27;s cannula: a cannula used during surgery of the larynx to prevent the patient from swallowing blood during surgery involving the head and neck.
* Trendelenburg gait: an abnormal gait caused by weakness of the abductor muscles of the lower limb, including the gluteus medius muscle and gluteus minimus muscle.
* Trendelenburg operation: ligation of the great saphenous vein, for the treatment of varicose veins. This term may also apply to pulmonary thrombectomy.
* Trendelenburg position, in which the patient is placed on a bed which is put into incline such that the patient&#x27;s head is lower than his feet.
* Trendelenburg&#x27;s sign: a sign of congenital dislocation of the hip.
* Trendelenburg&#x27;s test: a test for varicose veins as well as a test to assess hip mobility.

<text>The Kocher Viaduct () near Schwäbisch Hall in Germany is a bridge that conducts the Autobahn 6 across the Kocher valley between Heilbronn and Nuremberg. With a maximum height of 185m above the valley bottom, it is the highest viaduct in Germany and was also the bridge with the tallest pillars in the world before the Millau Viaduct was completed in 2004, in France.

The nine spans of the viaduct&#x27;s prestressed-concrete girder bridge cover a length of 1128m, with individual span lengths being 81m for the outer two and 138m for the remaining seven. Pillar height varies from 40m to 178m. The bridge table is 31m wide. Construction took place from 1976 to 1979.

A museum in the village of Geislingen am Kocher below the bridge not only tells the viaduct&#x27;s story but also displays dinosaur fossils found during the construction of the motorway.

<doc id="1284897" wikidata="Q130026" url="?curid=1284897" title="Robert Webb">
<text>Robert Patrick Webb (born 29 September 1972) is an English comedian, actor and writer. He rose to prominence alongside David Mitchell as the comedy duo Mitchell and Webb.

Mitchell and Webb starred in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Peep Show&quot;, in which Webb plays Jeremy &quot;Jez&quot; Usbourne. The two also starred in the sketch show &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot;, for which they then performed a stage adaptation, &quot;The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb&quot;. The duo starred in the 2007 film &quot;Magicians&quot;, and in the short-lived series &quot;Ambassadors&quot; in 2013. Webb headed the critically-acclaimed sitcom &quot;The Smoking Room&quot; and was a performer in the sketch show &quot;Bruiser&quot;. From 2017 to 2021, he starred alongside Mitchell in the Channel 4 comedy-drama &quot;Back&quot;.

Webb is also a regular comedy panellist, appearing on shows such as &quot;The Bubble&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, &quot;QI&quot;, &quot;Mastermind&quot;, &quot;Argumental&quot;, and &quot;Was It Something I Said?&quot; He has also hosted and narrated several programmes. His other sitcom appearances include &quot;Blessed&quot;, &quot;The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff&quot;, and &quot;Fresh Meat&quot;.

==Early life==
Robert Patrick Webb was born on 29 September 1972 in Boston, Lincolnshire, and grew up in Woodhall Spa. His parents divorced when he was five years old, with his mother remarrying a year or so later. He has two older brothers and a younger half-sister. He grew up on a council estate, and was educated at Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School in Horncastle. Having grown up watching the sitcoms &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, &quot;Blackadder&quot;, and &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, he became interested in drama and poetry while in school, and began writing parodies. At the age of 13, partly because of resentment towards his father, he made a conscious effort to lose his native Lincolnshire accent and now speaks with a more neutral English accent. When he was 17 and in the lower sixth form preparing for his A-levels, his mother died of breast cancer, and he moved in with his father and re-sat his A-levels. In 1992, Webb attended Robinson College, Cambridge, where he studied English and became vice-president of the Footlights, where he met David Mitchell. The two met at an audition for a Footlights production of &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 1993.

==Career==
===Mitchell and Webb===
The two put together their first project, a show about World War I titled &quot;Innocent Millions Dead or Dying – A Wry Look at the Post-Apocalyptic Age (With Songs)&quot;, in January 1995. Webb later described it as being &quot;fucking terrible&quot;. From this the duo were given the chance to write for Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller, and for series two of &quot;Big Train&quot;. After minor work on &quot;The Jack Docherty Show&quot; and &quot;Comedy Nation&quot;, their first break into television acting was in 2000, on the short-lived BBC sketch show &quot;Bruiser&quot;, which they primarily wrote, and starred in.

In 2001, the duo were commissioned for a sketch show of their own, entitled &quot;The Mitchell and Webb Situation&quot;, which ran for six episodes on the now defunct channel Play UK. Mitchell and Webb&#x27;s next project came in 2003, with starring roles in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Peep Show&quot;, as flatmates Mark Corrigan and Jeremy &quot;Jez&quot; Usbourne respectively. The pair shared the 2007 Royal Television Society Award for &quot;Comedy Performance&quot;, and were jointly nominated for Best Television Comedy Actor at the 2006 British Comedy Awards. Webb was nominated for the Best Television Comedy Actor award again, this time without Mitchell, in 2009. &quot;Peep Show&quot; ran for nine series, making it the longest-running sitcom in Channel 4 history.
After the success of &quot;Peep Show&quot;, Mitchell and Webb returned to sketch comedy with their BBC Radio 4 sketch show &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Sound&quot;, which ran for five series. The show was adapted for television and became &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot;; producer Gareth Edwards described it as &quot;the shortest pitch (he had) ever written&quot;. Towards the end of 2006 the pair made their first tour, with a show called &quot;The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb&quot;. The tour was criticised as just &quot;a succession of largely unrelated scenes&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Brian Logan, who gave it a rating of two stars.

&quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot; won them the BAFTA for &quot;Best Comedy Programme or Series&quot; at the 2007 awards, and they earned a further nomination for it in 2009. It was nominated for two British Comedy awards in 2006: &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best New TV Comedy&quot; and the &quot;Highland Spring People&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Their stage tour &quot;The Two Faces of Mitchell and Webb&quot; was nominated for the British Comedy Award for &quot;Best Stage Comedy&quot;, and &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Sound&quot; won a Sony Silver Award. Their first film, &quot;Magicians&quot;, was released on 18 May 2007. It was directed by Andrew O&#x27;Connor and written by Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain. Webb played the role of modern magician Karl.

They filmed &quot;Playing Shop&quot;, a comedy television pilot for BBC2 about two men who operate a business out of their shed, which they also wrote. Although the BBC were happy with it, Mitchell and Webb scrapped it themselves, as they felt it was too similar to &quot;Peep Show&quot;. A new pilot had been commissioned, but the plan was later shelved.

The duo fronted the campaign of the UK version of Apple Inc.&#x27;s Get a Mac adverts, with Mitchell playing a PC. The adverts proved controversial. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Charlie Brooker claimed that the use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in &quot;Peep Show&quot;, stating that &quot;when you see the ads, you think, &#x27;PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.&#x27;&quot; The British Sitcom Guide criticised the pair for &quot;selling their souls&quot;. One journalist called the adverts &quot;worse than not funny&quot;, and accused Mitchell and Webb of &quot;an act of grave betrayal&quot; for taking corporate work. In an interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Webb responded to the critics of the Apple adverts, stating that &quot;when someone asks, &#x27;Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of &quot;Peep Show&quot;?&#x27; the answer, obviously, is, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s fine&#x27;&quot;. In the same interview, Mitchell also said &quot;I don&#x27;t see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It&#x27;s alright to sell computers, isn&#x27;t it? Unless you think that capitalism is evil – which I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re helping to flog a baby-killing machine&quot;.

===Solo work===
Webb has appeared in two series of the BBC Three sitcom &quot;The Smoking Room&quot; (2004) and the Radio 4 sketch show &quot;Concrete Cow&quot;. In 2005 he appeared in the Ben Elton-scripted BBC One sitcom &quot;Blessed&quot; as Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s &#x27;perfect&#x27; counterpart.

He and Olivia Colman also featured as a naturist couple in &quot;Confetti&quot;, a 2006 film about a competition for the most original wedding. Webb has since said that he believed that his genitals would be pixellated out but only discovered at the screening of the film that they were not. Also in 2008, Webb made his West End stage debut in the UK premiere of Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;Fat Pig&quot;.

Webb won the 2009 series &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; for the charity Comic Relief, parodying the audition sequence from the film &quot;Flashdance&quot;. He narrated the series &quot;Young, Dumb and Living Off Mum&quot;. He hosted a 2010 Channel 4 series looking at the week&#x27;s online news, &quot;Robert&#x27;s Web&quot;.

He has appeared on several panel shows, including &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; and &quot;QI&quot;. In January 2011, Webb appeared on a celebrity version of BBC quiz &quot;Mastermind&quot;, answering nine questions correctly on his specialist subject (the novels of Ian McEwan) and 11 correctly on the general knowledge round. In 2011 Webb played Dan, a geology lecturer, in the Channel 4 series &quot;Fresh Meat&quot;. Later that year, he was cast in the costume comedy &quot;The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff&quot;, a parody of Charles Dickens&#x27; works. From 2011 to 2012 Webb replaced Rufus Hound as team captain on the BBC comedy panel show &quot;Argumental&quot;.

Webb was the narrator of Channel 5&#x27;s anti-nostalgia series &quot;10 Things I Hate About&quot;, which began on 16 April 2012. In each episode, Webb presented his opinion on the awful aspects of a particular year (1995, 1990, 1987, and 1999).

In 2011 Webb presented &quot;Groundbreaking Gags&quot; on BBC Three, in which he looked at the significant s for which that the animated show &quot;Family Guy&quot; has been recognised.

From December 2012 Webb featured in adverts for comparethemarket.com, as its founder Maurice Wigglethorpe-Throom.

From September 2021 Webb was a contestant in the nineteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Dianne Buswell. The couple completed three dances and were in 13th place, when Webb withdrew on 13 October, due to his heart condition. He said he had an urgent consultation with his heart specialist, after experiencing symptoms, and that she had recommended he pull out of the competition. Webb said he was &quot;extremely sorry&quot; to have to leave, adding: &quot;It became clear that I had bitten off way more than I could chew for this stage in my recovery.&quot;

Webb was the invited guest on the Radio 4 long running series &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, hosted by Lauren Laverne in March 2023.

==Writing==
Together with Mitchell, Webb published his first comedy book &quot;This Mitchell and Webb Book&quot;, which was released in the UK and the US in 2009 by HarperCollins imprint Fourth Estate. An abridged edition of highlights from &quot;This Mitchell and Webb Book&quot;, entitled &quot;How to Cope with Mitchell and Webb&quot;, was released only in the UK on 1 October 2009. The pair signed a two-book deal with Fourth Estate but, as of November 2013, a second book remained unpublished.

Webb wrote articles for the comments pages of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; newspaper between 2009 and 2011. He criticised those who commented on the online versions of his articles in a &quot;New Statesman&quot; piece. In a 2013 interview, Webb explained his experience with the publication:
Webb thinks it is harmful for men to &#x27;keep a stiff upper lip&#x27; and hide their feelings.

In 2015, Webb began writing his first solo memoir, &quot;How Not to Be a Boy&quot;, on growing up in working class Lincolnshire. The memoir was released in August 2017. A spoken-word adaptation, read by Webb, was featured as BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot; to coincide with the launch.

In 2020, Canongate published Webb&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Come Again&quot;.

== Politics ==
In August 2014, Webb was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Webb was a staunch supporter of the Labour Party, and joined the party in 2013 in response to Russell Brand&#x27;s interview on &quot;Newsnight&quot; in which Brand suggested people should not vote as a form of protest. By November 2015, Webb announced on Twitter that he was leaving the Labour Party, citing his lack of confidence in party leader Jeremy Corbyn. He also expressed his disapproval at the appointment of &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Seumas Milne as Labour&#x27;s press secretary, and was quoted as saying that paying his party subscription with Milne in the post made him &quot;feel sick&quot;. However, he endorsed the Labour Party in the 2017 general election.

In December 2018, Webb tweeted his support of an article by Janice Turner in which she criticised Mermaids (a charity which supports transgender children and their families) that had sought and was eventually awarded a £500,000 UK National Lottery grant. He also identified himself as a &quot;gender-critical feminist&quot; but emphasised that he opposes transphobia. He stood by his comments in a 2020 interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In a 2021 interview with Jesse Thorn on the NPR show &quot;Bullseye&quot;, he said that his criticism of Mermaids should not be confused with an opposition to supporting transgender children, and that the debate around gender-nonconforming children had become overheated. When asked for details on his opposition to Mermaids, he declined to elaborate further and stated he could no longer remember the specifics. He has been criticised by some LGBT news outlets, charities, and activists for this stance.

==Personal life==
Webb married fellow comedian Abigail Burdess in 2006, with whom he had worked on the BBC Two comedy show &quot;The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff&quot;. His comedy partner David Mitchell was the best man. They live in London&#x27;s West Hampstead area and have two daughters.

In a 2008 &quot;Independent&quot; article, Webb explained that he was a &quot;swaggering atheist&quot; prior to the death of his mother, but that the loss led to him starting to pray. Upon reflection, however, he stated that his temporary departure from atheism was a coping mechanism for the loss and he returned to atheism after he learned to &quot;co-exist&quot; with his mother&#x27;s death: &quot;I&#x27;ve returned to total non-belief. I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last, but God, it&#x27;s good to be back!&quot; That same year, Mitchell &amp; Webb faced criticism and accusations of &quot;selling out&quot; for appearing in an advertisement for Apple Inc. Webb responded, &quot;I&#x27;m not a sell-out. The problem is that that presupposes a set of principles we don&#x27;t actually hold. We never said comedians shouldn&#x27;t do ads, or that we somehow operate outside the mixed market economy... really, we&#x27;re just doing a job.

In his 2017 memoir &quot;How Not to Be a Boy&quot;, Webb revealed that he is bisexual.

In 2020, Webb underwent emergency surgery on his heart for a mitral valve prolapse after being diagnosed with the condition at a routine medical check. He had attributed the symptoms to binge drinking, saying, &quot;I just assumed, that&#x27;s the booze... I thought this is what you feel like when you&#x27;re 47 and you treat your body like a skip.&quot; He then gave up drinking alcohol entirely and said, &quot;The drinking crawled up so gradually that I was slow-killing myself... it was certainly an addiction at the end, a dependency. I was thinking of [drinking] at any given time of the day.&quot;

<text>The Körsch Viaduct is a bridge that crosses the Körsch Valley (river Körsch) in Germany, supporting a road around Nellingen. It was built from 1991 to 1993 by incremental launch. It was handed over to the public on 6 September 1995. The bridge also crosses a 110 kilovolt power line of the EnBW AG and a sewage treatment plant.

<text>This is a summary of 2001 in music in the United Kingdom.

==Events==
*13 February – Peter Frampton receives the Orville H. Gibson Lifetime Achievement Award.
*17 February – Manic Street Preachers become the first western rock band to play in Cuba. (Fidel Castro is in attendance.) They did not tour, meaning that an unsigned British rock band, Sandstone Veterans, remain the only band from the western world to tour Cuba.
*8 March – Melanie C announces she does not intend to do any more work with the Spice Girls. Although the group denies it is splitting, it would not be active again until 2007.
*26 March – Damon Albarn&#x27;s project Gorillaz releases &quot;their eponymous debut studio album&quot;, which would sell over seven million copies worldwide by 2007, earning them an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the Most Successful Virtual Band.

<text>Băicoi () is a town in Prahova County, Romania, near the 45th parallel. Five localities are administered by the town: Dâmbu, Liliești, Schela, Tufeni, and Țintea. Over time, these have become neighborhoods of the town. 

Bӑicoi is located in the historical region of Muntenia. It is situated in the center of the county, and stretches for at its widest. The town is crossed on its southwestern side by the national road DN1, which connects it to the county seat, Ploiești, to the southeast and Brașov, to the north. Bӑicoi lies near Florești, a train stop between Ploiești and Câmpina.

==History==

The name of the town is derived from &quot;Baicu&quot;. At the end of the 19th century, Băicoi was a rural commune, formed by the villages of Băicoi, Cotoiu, Tufeni, and Găgeni, totaling 3,257 inhabitants. The other localities of the current town made up the Țintea commune, which consisted of Țintea, Dâmbu, and Liliești villages, totaling 1,240 inhabitants. Both communes were part of Plasa Filipești, in Prahova County. By 1925, Băicoi commune had 5,946 inhabitants, in Băicoi, Cotoiu, and Tufeni villages (Găgeni village having been assigned to Păulești commune); Țintea commune, in the same composition, had 2,639 inhabitants. 

Băicoi commune was declared a town in 1948, at the beginning of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic. After the administrative reorganization of 1950, the town became part of the Câmpina raion of , which was enlarged in 1952 and was renamed Ploiești Region. When the regions were abolished in 1968, Țintea commune with all its villages was assigned to the town of Băicoi, which became part of Prahova County.

<doc id="1284911" wikidata="Q1265765" url="?curid=1284911" title="James Bond music">
<text>Since its inception in 1962, the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series from Eon Productions has featured many musical compositions, many of which are now considered classic pieces of British film music. The best known piece is the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; composed by Monty Norman. Other instrumentals, such as &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, and various songs performed by British or American artists such as Shirley Bassey&#x27;s &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot;, Sheena Easton&#x27;s &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;GoldenEye&quot; also become identified with the series.

Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Die Another Day&quot; became a dance hit around the world, while &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; is the only &quot;Bond&quot; song to have reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Three &quot;Bond&quot; songs have won the Academy Award for Best Original Song: &quot;Skyfall&quot; by Adele, &quot;Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; by Sam Smith and &quot;No Time to Die&quot; by Billie Eilish, while &quot;Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; also became the first Bond theme to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart.

==Music from Eon Productions==
===&quot;James Bond Theme&quot;===
The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; is the main signature theme of the James Bond films and has featured in every Eon Productions Bond film since &quot;Dr. No&quot;, released in 1962. The piece has been used as an accompanying fanfare to the gun barrel sequence in every Eon Bond film before &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

===&quot;James Bond Is Back&quot;===
The briefest of &quot;James Bond themes&quot;, this composition started off the &quot;Opening Titles&quot; music of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. It was heard in the &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; film trailer,
 as well as in the pre-title sequence of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. WLS (AM) used the theme in the mid-1960s for their secret agent radio serial &quot;The Wild Adventures of Peter Fugitive&quot; that appeared on &quot;The Art Roberts Show&quot;.

===&quot;007 Theme&quot;===

&quot;007 Theme&quot;, also known as &quot;007 Takes the Lektor&quot;, is an adventure theme composed by John Barry in 1963 for the Bond film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;.
&quot;The John Barry Seven&quot; had pop chart hit with a cover version of Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s theme to &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; that included seven beats repeated throughout the theme. Barry used seven beats throughout the &quot;007 Theme&quot;.

It became a secondary theme for the Bond films, being used throughout the series, primarily during action scenes. Its most notable appearances are:
* &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; – played during the gypsy camp gunfight and also during Bond&#x27;s theft of the Lektor decoder from the Russian embassy in Istanbul.
* &quot;Thunderball&quot; – played briefly in a climactic underwater fight; a similar but different theme of seven beats is played when Bond runs from SPECTRE during a parade and during the climax.
* &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; – played during the flight of &quot;Little Nellie&quot; before Bond battles four helicopters that attack him.
* &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; – played during Bond&#x27;s destruction of Blofeld&#x27;s Headquarters.
* &quot;Moonraker&quot; – played during the Amazon River chase.

The theme has not been used in its entirety in a Bond film since its use in &quot;Moonraker&quot;.

This piece of music was also used by Al Primo, the news director at KYW-TV in Philadelphia for its long-time theme to &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;, and was adopted by other Group W stations in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Boston and San Francisco as well as other non-Group W stations, including WLS-TV in Chicago. The theme was also sampled by Big Audio Dynamite for the 1986 song &quot;Sightsee M.C!&quot;

===&quot;Suspense&quot; motif===
Like John Barry, David Arnold has left his own mark in the music of James Bond. In this case, he has established what can be called the &quot;suspense motif&quot;, which is a descending, often repetitive four-note motif that can be heard in all of the Bond films he has scored. This motif can be heard in:
* &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; – &quot;Station Break&quot;, &quot;*-3-Send&quot;, &quot;Underwater Discovery&quot;
* &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; – &quot;Pipeline&quot;, &quot;Remember Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Torture Queen&quot;, &quot;Submarine&quot;
* &quot;Die Another Day&quot; – &quot;Death of Moon&quot;, &quot;Iced Inc&quot;, &quot;Antonov&quot;
* &quot;Casino Royale&quot; – &quot;Miami International&quot;, &quot;Dirty Martini&quot;, and very briefly in &quot;African Rundown&quot;
* &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; – briefly in &quot;Time to Get Out&quot;, and twice in &quot;Perla de las dunas&quot;

===Composers ===
The largest contributions to the Bond films, save for the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;, are works from John Barry. Barry composed eleven Bond soundtracks and is credited with the creation of &quot;007&quot; (dominated by brass and percussion) and the popular orchestral theme from &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;.

Next to Barry, David Arnold is the series&#x27; most regular composer. He composed the scores for five Bond films: &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; through &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;. His orchestrations combined with electronic rhythm elements gave the Pierce Brosnan era its musical identity. Arnold was essentially Barry&#x27;s anointed successor, Barry having recommended Arnold to Barbara Broccoli when she took over the Bond films from her father Albert R. Broccoli.

Other major composers and record-producers include George Martin, Bill Conti, Michael Kamen, Marvin Hamlisch, Éric Serra, Thomas Newman and Hans Zimmer. Each of these composed for only one Bond film, with the exception of Newman. The departures from John Barry had various causes; sometimes Barry declined in order to avoid paying double income tax—US and UK. Barry died in 2011. Sometimes the director of a Bond film had worked with the composer of his choice on other films – the latter happened to Thomas Newman with &quot;Skyfall&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;.


===Title themes===
The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; is the main theme for &quot;Dr. No&quot;, and has featured in all the Eon Productions Bond films in different versions. The theme has also featured on the gun barrel sequences at the beginning of the films. The original theme was written by Monty Norman, and was performed by John Barry and his orchestra in 1962. In the opening credits of &quot;Dr. No&quot;, two other pieces were played: an untitled bongo interlude and a Calypso-flavored rendition of &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;, titled &quot;Kingston Calypso&quot;. Due to this, &quot;Dr. No&quot; is the only film to have more than one opening theme. The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; reached 13 in the UK Singles Chart, and remained in the charts for 13 weeks.

The opening credits of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; were accompanied by an instrumental version of the main theme, arranged by John Barry and written by Lionel Bart. A single by The John Barry Orchestra reached 39 in the U.K. At the film&#x27;s end, a vocal version by English singer Matt Monro is heard. This song spent 13 weeks in the U.K. charts, peaking at 20.

&quot;Goldfinger&quot; was the third soundtrack composed by John Barry, and this time the theme song had lyrics written by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. The soundtrack reached 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spent 70 weeks on the charts. It also peaked at 14 on the UK Albums Chart, and received the Bond series first Grammy Award nomination, Best Original Score from a Motion Picture or Television Show.

Welsh singer Shirley Bassey is the only singer to perform more than one Bond theme – she recorded the themes to &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, and &quot;Moonraker&quot;. Bassey also recorded her own versions of &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; for &quot;Thunderball&quot; and it was rumoured that No Good About Goodbye was intended for &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, however David Arnold said &#x27;No Good About Goodbye&#x27; was never intended as a Bond song.

Paul McCartney&#x27;s performance of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; was the first Bond theme song to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song; it reached 2 as a U.S. single, and 9 on the U.K. charts. George Martin&#x27;s work in the song won the Grammy for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists.

Marvin Hamlisch&#x27;s (music) and Carole Bayer Sager&#x27;s (lyrics) &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot; (performed by Carly Simon) received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, as did Bill Conti&#x27;s &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, which was performed by Sheena Easton.

It was not until the 2013 Oscars that a Bond theme song finally won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the theme song from &quot;Skyfall&quot; by Adele. Thomas Newman&#x27;s score also got the first nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Score in the series since Hamlisch&#x27;s own for &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, while winning the Grammy for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Adele&#x27;s song also won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. Sam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; from &quot;Spectre&quot; and Billie Eilish&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Die&quot; from the film of the same name would also win Oscars for Best Original Song.

Duran Duran and John Barry&#x27;s &quot;A View To A Kill&quot; topped the singles charts in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the only Bond theme to hit 1 in the United States. No James Bond theme had topped the charts in the UK until Sam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; entered the charts at number one on 2 October 2015.

Several of the later films have alternative theme songs, often during the closing credits. &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; featured The Pretenders performing &quot;If There Was a Man,&quot; composed by John Barry with Chrissie Hynde. &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; has &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; sung by Patti LaBelle. &quot;GoldenEye&quot; featured Éric Serra&#x27;s &quot;The Experience of Love&quot;. &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; included k.d. lang&#x27;s &quot;Surrender&quot; during the closing credits, a song which was originally proposed by composer David Arnold to be the title sequence theme instead of the Sheryl Crow title song. The &quot;Surrender&quot; theme is heard throughout the score while the melody of Sheryl Crow&#x27;s song is not used again during the film. This harks back to the &quot;Thunderball&quot; soundtrack, where &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; was originally proposed as the opening credits music, only to be replaced by the eponymous title track as sung by Tom Jones.

&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; featured an instrumental theme tune, something which remains unique amongst the post–&quot;From Russia with Love&quot; films, and included a vocal theme in the form of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s performance of &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot;, written by John Barry and Hal David.
* A song titled &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; sung by Shirley Bassey was originally slated to be the theme song of &quot;Thunderball&quot;. It was re-recorded by Dionne Warwick, but Albert Broccoli insisted the theme song must include the film&#x27;s title and also decided that the lyrics should not start before the film&#x27;s title &quot;Thunderball&quot; appears on-screen. A new song was composed and recorded at the eleventh hour titled &quot;Thunderball&quot;, performed by Tom Jones. The melody of &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; remains a major component of the film score.
* The songs &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; (&quot;Dr No&quot;), &quot;All Time High&quot; (&quot;Octopussy&quot;), &quot;You Know My Name&quot; (&quot;Casino Royale&quot;), &quot;Another Way to Die&quot; (&quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;) and &quot;Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; (&quot;Spectre&quot;) do not feature the title of its film either in the song title or lyrics (although &quot;Another Way to Die&quot; features the word &quot;solace&quot; in the second stanza). While not named after the film, &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot; does feature the line &quot;the spy who loved me&quot; in its lyrics.
* &quot;You Know My Name&quot;, &quot;Skyfall&quot;, and &quot;Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; do not appear on their respective films&#x27; soundtrack albums, having been released as standalone singles instead.
* &quot;No Time to Die&quot; was released in February 2020 when the movie was scheduled to be released in April 2020. The movie release was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic to Fall of 2021.

===Secondary songs===
A number of Bond films include one (or more) additional songs in the soundtrack. Some of these pieces of music, such as &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot; by Louis Armstrong, have gone on to become as well known as the main themes, while other songs remain exclusively linked to the film in which they appear.
* Matt Monro&#x27;s vocal rendition of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; is often considered the official theme song for that film, even though the opening credits use an instrumental version that also incorporates the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. Monro&#x27;s version isn&#x27;t heard until about 15 minutes into the film over a radio as source music, and again over the closing titles.
* Dionne Warwick&#x27;s performance of &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; is never actually heard in &quot;Thunderball&quot;; it was originally intended to have been the opening credits theme, but this was changed when Albert Broccoli decreed the theme had to include the film&#x27;s title. The melody of &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; is heard throughout the film; Warwick&#x27;s version was finally released in the 1990s.
* The original end title theme to &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; was &quot;Only Myself to Blame&quot;, composed by David Arnold and Don Black, and sung by Scott Walker, but was left out of the final film and replaced by an Arnold arrangement of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. &quot;Blame&quot; was, however, left on &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; soundtrack album, and its melody, representing the Elektra King character, appears throughout &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; score, most prominently in the tracks &quot;Casino&quot; and &quot;Elektra&#x27;s Theme&quot;.

===Foreign songs===
Some songs have been dubbed for the foreign versions of the films.

* &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was sung in Spanish by Karina (María Isabel Llaudes Santiago), a French version was sung by both John William and Catherine Elia and an Italian version was recorded by Vanna Scotti.
* &quot;Feuerball&quot; sung by Alan Corb was, in 1965, the German Cover version of &quot;Thunderball&quot; (sung by Tom Jones). The B-side of the single contained a German version, also sung by Alan Corb, of &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; with that title, creating the bizarre situation that a vocal &#x27;cover&#x27; version of the song was published before the original vocal version(s) (sung by both by Shirley Bassey and Dionne Warwick), which were both published in the early 1990s with &quot;The Best of James Bond&quot; 30th Anniversary and 30th Anniversary Limited Edition albums.
* &quot;Man Lebt Nur Zweimal&quot; sung by Gissy André was, in 1967, the German Cover version of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (sung by Nancy Sinatra). 
* &quot;Tu vivras deux fois&quot; sung by Lucky Blondo was, in 1967, the French Cover version of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (sung by Nancy Sinatra). 
* &quot;In Deinen Augen&quot;, sung by Sollie Nero, was, in 1981, the German Cover version of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (sung by Sheena Easton).

===Additional music===

===Unused songs===
A number of songs have been recorded for Bond films but not used.

* &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; by Dionne Warwick and Shirley Bassey was written for &quot;Thunderball&quot;. Its title refers to a nickname given to Bond by an Italian journalist in 1962. Warwick and Bassey both recorded versions, but halfway through the scoring process, producer Albert Broccoli decided that the film&#x27;s title must appear in the lyrics, so &quot;Thunderball&quot; was commissioned. The song&#x27;s melody still plays a prominent role in the score and both singers&#x27; versions have appeared on compilations in the 1990s.
* &quot;Thunderball&quot; by Johnny Cash
* &quot;Run James Run&quot; by Brian Wilson, intended as a Bond theme, but ultimately released as the eponymous track on the Beach Boys&#x27; album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.
* &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; by Julie Rogers is included on the 30th-anniversary release of &quot;The Best of James Bond&quot;.
* &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; by Lorraine Chandler appears on &quot;R(are) C(ollectable) A(nd Soulful) Volume 2&quot;.
* &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; by Alice Cooper appears on their 1973 album &quot;Muscle of Love&quot;
* &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; by Blondie appears on their 1982 album &quot;The Hunter&quot;.
* &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; by Pet Shop Boys was adapted from a demo theme for &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, later reworked as &quot;This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave&quot;. It appears on their 1990 album &quot;Behaviour&quot;.
* &quot;The Juvenile&quot; by Ace of Base was originally written in 1995 as &quot;The Goldeneye&quot;, then rewritten as &quot;The Juvenile&quot; and released in 2002 on Da Capo.
* &quot;Tomorrow Never Lies&quot; by Pulp, originally titled &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, was released as a B-side on their 1997 single &quot;Help the Aged&quot;, and on the vinyl version of their 1998 album &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot;.
* &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; by Saint Etienne appears on their &quot;Built on Sand&quot; album. The liner notes state that Pierce Brosnan kept the master tape of the song. Other artists who submitted &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; themes include Marc Almond, Swan Lee, the Cardigans and Space.
* &quot;Man of War&quot; was written by the English band Radiohead in the 1990s. It was submitted for &quot;Spectre&quot;, but was rejected as it had not been written for the film, making it ineligible for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Radiohead wrote another song for the film, &quot;Spectre&quot;, but it was rejected as too melancholy.
===Cover versions and spin-offs===
Bond music has inspired a number of cover albums in a variety of genres, including the 2007 album &quot;Mister Bond – A Jazzy Cocktail of Ice Cold Themes&quot; (lounge) and &quot;Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project&quot;, the latter of which features David Arnold collaborating with several contemporary artists. The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra recorded several albums with Bond music and performs in premieres and special events of Bond films. Britain&#x27;s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra released an album of several Bond songs performances called &quot;Best Of James Bond&quot;, some of which were used on the menus of &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; DVD releases. Billy Strange released &quot;Secret Agent File&quot; in 1965. In 2004, The Cavaliers played a show titled &quot;007&quot; using Bond music such as &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, &quot;Hovercraft Chase&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Cuba&quot; and &quot;Paris and Bond&quot;. Some of them are Italo disco-like rhythms and soundtrack albums promote hits that matches the film&#x27;s theme. In 2000 &#x27;An Electronika Tribute to James Bond&#x27; album was released adding yet another genre to the Bond fandom.

==Non-Eon Productions songs==

===Main title themes===

* The closing credits of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; use a vocal version of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; sung by Mike Redway, who remained uncredited until the release of the 2012 &#x27;45th anniversary&#x27; edition of the soundtrack.

===Secondary songs===

* The soundtrack to the 1967 spoof &quot;Casino Royale&quot; also included two short comedic songs sung in a 1920s style. One led into an instrumental version of &quot;The Look of Love&quot; and began with the line &quot;James Bond playing at Casino Royale...&quot;; later, this tune was reprised as &quot;Seven James Bonds at Casino Royale&quot;, which leads into a lyrical version of the theme sung by Mike Redway that played over the closing credits.
* &quot;The Look of Love&quot; was the first song from any Bond film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, six years before the first nomination from an Eon Bond film. It remains the only song from a non-Eon Bond film so nominated.
===Unused song===
* &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; by Phyllis Hyman was intended for &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;.

==Video games==
With the increase in audio quality for video game consoles and personal computers, in addition to the continued popularity of computer and video games, publisher Electronic Arts as well as Activision (since 2008) has included opening themes and film-style credit sequences to some of its more recent James Bond video games &amp; spin offs.

==Novels==
The 2008 continuation novel &quot;Devil May Care&quot; by Sebastian Faulks was the first James Bond novel to receive its own theme song. Also called &quot;Devil May Care&quot;, the song was written and recorded by Cardiff band SAL and was available on the UK audiobook release of the novel.

<doc id="1284917" wikidata="Q1191912" url="?curid=1284917" title="Pokémon Dash">
<text>is a racing video game developed by Ambrella and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It was a launch title both in Japan and Europe. &quot;Dash&quot; was released in Japan on December 2, 2004; Europe on March 11, 2005; North America on March 14, 2005; and Australia on April 7, 2005. It was the first &quot;Pokémon&quot; game to be released for the Nintendo DS.

The player uses a stylus to control a Pikachu and race through checkpoints. After players have passed each of the number of checkpoints in order, the course is completed. &quot;Dash&quot; has multiplayer support, and can connect with 6 different devices.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Dash&quot; is a top-down perspective racing video game in which the player uses a stylus to control a Pikachu and race through checkpoints. After players have passed all the checkpoints in order, the course is completed. The stylus is used by moving the stylus in the direction the player wants Pikachu to run. Along with racing on the ground, there are races in the sky using balloons. There are many different terrains such as mazestone paths, forests, beaches, water, swamp, and lava pools. Throughout the courses are power ups which allow the player to run on different terrains without slowing down. &quot;Dash&quot; also features a training cup, which is given to players starting the game for the first time. After completing the training cup, the player has the chance to play in the Grand Prix Mode. There are five main cups to compete in GP mode. &quot;Dash&quot; also offers harder GP modes that can be unlocked, which put the player against a faster level of Pokémon. Each cup has five courses within its area.

===Connectivity to other devices===
&quot;Dash&quot; has multiplayer support. Up to six Nintendo DS units can be connected together. &quot;Dash&quot; features compatibility with the Game Boy Advance games &quot;Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire&quot;, &quot;FireRed, LeafGreen&quot;, or &quot;Emerald&quot;. If the player inserts any of those cartridges in Slot 2, and has completed GP mode, they can play courses shaped like the Pokémon in their team. The time to complete the courses depends on factors like type and level.

==Development==
&quot;Dash&quot; was developed for the Nintendo DS by Ambrella, who also developed &quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot;. It was first revealed October 7, 2004, as a launch title for Japan. &quot;Dash&quot; was released in Japan on December 2, 2004; Europe on March 11, 2005; North America on March 14, 2005; and Australia on April 7, 2005. Before the North American release, The Pokémon Center had pre-order deals which included keychains and DS carrying pouches.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, however, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of one eight, one seven, and two eights for a total of 31 out of 40.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Craig Harris thought the player could only play as Pikachu in single player, and the game could also be finished within hours. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Alex Navarro said that the game &quot;is simply one of the laziest uses of the DS&#x27;s touch screen technology to date&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Slo Mo said, &quot;&quot;Dash&quot; might not make much of a splash, but it should be a good kid-pleaser.&quot; &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Phil Theobald said, &quot;Gimmicky titles like this may be cute diversions, but they&#x27;re no substitute for the real deal.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it a &quot;cute and fun little racing game that has a great multiplayer component, but there&#x27;s simply not enough to it.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; said, &quot;Controlling Pikachu with stylus strokes is actually quite fun, but as a racing game, Dash isn&#x27;t fully realized.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; called it more of an exercise in anger management than a game. While discussing the mixed quality of &quot;Pokémon&quot; spin-offs, Retronauts cited &quot;Pokémon Dash&quot; as an example.

By December 23, &quot;Dash&quot; had sold 109,000 units.

<text>Kish Airlines (, &quot;Havāpeymāyi-e Kish&quot;) is an airline operating from Kish Island, Iran. It operates international, domestic and charter services as a scheduled carrier. Its main bases are Kish International Airport and Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran.

==History==

The airline was established on December 16, 1989, and started operations in 1990. It is owned by Kish Free Zone Organisation (79%), Kish Investment and Development (11%) and Kish Development and Servicing (10%).

To start its passenger operations, after receiving temporary operations permission, the airline leased two aircraft (three Tupolev Tu-154 and four McDonnell Douglas MD-82/MD-83) from Bulgaria Airlines on a wet lease. Kish Air received its air operator certificate (AOC) in 1991, thus becoming the first private company to receive its AOC from Civil Aviation of Iran. At this time the company began wet-leasing three Tupolev Tu-154Ms from Russian leasing companies, returning the previously leased Bulgarian aircraft. The company also wet-leased two Yakovlev Yak-42D aircraft from Russia.

Towards the end of 1992, the company was at the verge of bankruptcy, and most of the key managers were replaced. In 1999, Kish Air having enough financial strength, decided to replace its wet-leased fleet with dry leased and purchased aircraft, and was able to operate two dry leased and two purchased Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft and hire and train the required aircrew and maintenance personnel. At present Kish Air also operates a fleet of medium-range MD-80 series aircraft and short-range Fokker 100 on its domestic and international routes.

==Destinations==

As of September 2023, Kish Air operates services to the following destinations:

==Fleet==

As of February 2025, Kish Air operates the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
In April 2017, it was announced that the airline planned to order six aircraft from ATR, with variant and delivery dates announced if, and when, the deal is signed by the airline. The aircraft were planned to be used to increase the number of flights on domestic flights in Iran.

===Former fleet===
The airline previously operated the following aircraft (at November 2017):
* 2 Airbus A320 leased from Jordan Aviation
* 1 Boeing 737-500 leased from Bukovyna Airlines
* 7 Fokker 50

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 19 September 1995, Kish Air Flight 707 was hijacked by flight attendant Reza Jabbari and landed in Israel, where the hijacker was arrested. Jabbari requested asylum and declared his intention of converting to Judaism. Sentenced to eight years in prison, he served four years but was granted asylum and remained in Israel. He eventually became an Israeli citizen and converted to Judaism.
*On 10 February 2004, Kish Air Flight 7170, operated by a Fokker 50 Mk.050, crashed at Sharjah International Airport killing 43 people. There were three survivors with serious injuries. The cause was that the propellers were put into reverse pitch while the aircraft was in flight.

<text>Iran Aseman Airlines () is an Iranian airline, the third-largest in the country, headquartered in Tehran. It operates scheduled domestic passenger services and regional international services.
== History ==
The airline was established and started operating in 1980. The airline&#x27;s historic links go back to 1958 to the airline Air Taxi Co., which was rebranded as Pars Air in the 1970s and later as Iran Aseman Airlines. In March 2007, it was owned by Iranian Civil Pension Fund Investment Company and had 298 employees. It has since been privatized.

The logo of Aseman Airlines is navy blue and is inspired by a flying Crane (Dorna). In August 2014, Iran Aseman Airlines made changed the combination of its logo and livery to the current version. The design was prepared by a designer from Mashhad named Saeed Khosrovan, and was soon implemented on all aircraft operated by the airline.

In July 2016, the CEO of the airline was issued an arrest warrant because of an alleged sum of approximately $37 million in public debts to Iran Airports &amp; Air Navigation Company.

In February 2017, it emerged that Aseman Airlines was in talks with an Irish firm to lease seven Airbus A320neos.
In April 2017, the airline signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Boeing for the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with options for another 30 aircraft. In June 2017, Iran Aseman Airlines signed a final deal to buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets. In June 2018, Boeing announced it would not be able to deliver any aircraft to Iranian airlines due to the US&#x27;s sanctions against Iran.

On 13 January 2019, the airline operated the last Boeing 727 commercial passenger flight worldwide.

The airline is currently banned from operating in the airspace of the European Union for &quot;failing to meet [safety-related] regulatory oversight standards of the EU&quot;.

<text>Großenkneten is a municipality in the district of Oldenburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

==Geography==
Großenkneten is one of the largest municipalities in Germany, in terms of its area, and is situated between the rivers Hunte and Lethe, in the landscape called &quot;Wildeshauser Geest&quot;. The place – consisting of the villages Huntlosen, Ahlhorn and Großenkneten – is still mostly agrarian, but is becoming more and more popular as a place of residence for commuters to Oldenburg.

==Neighborhoods==
Großenkneten is divided in 19 neighborhoods (&quot;Ortsteile&quot;), which are (with population of 2012): Ahlhorn (6.441), Amelhausen (120), Bakenhus (48), Bissel (319), Döhlen (461), Großenkneten (2.637), Hagel (32), Halenhorst (237), Haschenbrok (79), Hengstlage (136), Hespenbusch-Pallast (78), Hosüne (569), Huntlosen (1.831), Husum (60), Sage (623), Sage-Haast (290), Sannum (217), Steinloge (128) and Westrittrum (106).

==History==
In 1933 the municipality Huntlosen was incorporated into Großenkneten, giving it its current extent.

Between 1952 and 1957 Karl Poggensee and his association DAFRA (the precursor of the Hermann Oberth Society) operated a small launch site for experimental rockets close to the Hespenbusch farm. In 1957 the launch site was shifted to Cuxhaven as the site in Großenkneten had become too small.

The band Trio, formed in Großenkneten in 1979, had a hit in more than 30 countries with their song &quot;Da Da Da&quot; in 1982.

==Notable places==
Special recreational locations include several prehistoric tombs and the fish lakes of Ahlhorn. Originally built in the 1880s as a fish farm using the waters of the river Lethe, they have been a nature preserve since 1993. Of the 2 square kilometres of water around 1.2 square kilometres are still used for fish farming today.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;
Drop shipping is a form of retail business in which the seller accepts customer orders without keeping stock on hand. Instead, in a form of supply chain management, the seller transfers the orders and their shipment details either to the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer.

The seller is responsible for marketing and selling the product, but has limited control over product quality, storage, inventory management, or shipping. It avoids the costs of maintaining warehouses – or even a storefront – purchasing and storing inventory, and employing necessary staff for such functions.

Drop shipping has become a popular business model as it requires minimal initial investment and overhead costs. A drop shipping operation can be managed from any location with an internet connection. However, drop shipping also has its drawbacks, including lower profit margins, less control over the quality of the products sold and an increased risk of shipping delays or supply chain issues.

Amazon, the online shopping giant, found early success in a drop shipping business model where they could offer over a million different books to consumers while only keeping approximately 2,000 of the more popular titles in stock. Publishers and wholesalers would receive forwarded orders from Amazon and would ship the products directly to the customer using packaging from Amazon.

==Procedure==
A drop shipping business to consumer model does not require a brick and mortar store. It may be eliminated, or combined with a drop shipped order fulfillment business model. A physical retailer may keep potential drop shipped items on display, provide details on mail order items via a catalogue, or maintain a website with information available only online. A virtual retailer only has a website.

Drop shipping retailers are not required to disclose the practice, nor, as with any other retailer, the wholesale source of the products they offer. This can be achieved by &quot;blind shipping&quot; (shipping merchandise without a return address corresponding to the seller), &quot;private label shipping&quot; (having merchandise shipped from the wholesaler with a return address customised to the retailer), or utilising a fulfillment house. The ultimate order fulfiller might also include a customised packing slip, including details such as the retailer&#x27;s company name, logo, and contact information.

Sellers on online auction sites such as eBay also use drop shipping as way of distributing products without stocking the items sold. A seller will list an item as new, and have purchased items shipped directly from the wholesaler to the customer. The seller&#x27;s profit is the difference between the selling and the wholesale prices, minus any pertinent selling, merchant, or shipping fees accruing to them. However, some of the drop shipping methods used by sellers are not allowed under the eBay terms of service. This includes drop shipping methods in which a seller fulfills an order by purchasing the item from another online marketplace and having the item shipped to the customer. Sellers who use this method can be suspended from eBay.

Products may be listed by a drop shipping retailer as available but actually be back-ordered either with the wholesaler or the item&#x27;s manufacturer. Such potential delays in order fulfilment are not always known, or even when known disclosed, by a seller. They also can be extended, beyond the control of the seller. Likewise order fulfilment and shipping delays are beyond the seller&#x27;s control, yet can reflect badly on the purchaser&#x27;s ultimate satisfaction with their transaction. This puts a premium on timely and accurate information provision by the seller on both sides of the purchase, both before and after it is made.

==Economics==
The economics of dropshipping can be complex and depends on a number of different factors such as cost of goods, handling and shipping fees, marketing and advertising expenses, profit margins and scale or efficiency.

Cost of goods is important as the markup from the wholesale price is the dropshipper&#x27;s profit margin. Dropshippers do not physically handle their products thus, shipping and handling fees can vary depending on supplier and customer location. Suppliers may charge a flat rate or percentage of sales price impacting profit margins of the dropshipper. Furthermore, in order to attract customers, dropshippers invest in marketing and advertising campaigns such as social media ads, influencer partnerships and search engine optimization.

==In China==
With the ever growing relevancy of drop shipping, this business model has become increasingly popular with the rise of e-commerce platforms and the ease of global trade, from China especially. China is globally recognised as a manufacturing powerhouse, producing a vast array of products at competitive prices. This has made it a promising source for drop shippers whose interests require cost-effective and diverse products to sell in their online stores. Through establishing a partnership with Chinese suppliers, drop shippers can offer a wide range of products without the need to invest in inventory. In addition, China has extensive access to global markets which enables to drop shippers to continually expand their investments. China provides a well-established shipping and logistics infrastructure in place, enables efficient and cost-effective transportation of goods to customers worldwide, providing a crucial component for the success of the drop shipping model, as timely and reliable shipping is a key factor in customer satisfaction.

China&#x27;s relation with the drop shipping business model is already well established with e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and AliExpress which have facilitated the growth of drop shipping by supplying in a high demand marketplace for suppliers and drop shippers to connect. Subsequently, with these platforms continually expanding, China has experienced exponential economic growth, leading to increased disposable income for its citizens. Moreover, internet penetration and smartphone adoption have also increased quite drastically. The combination of these factors have manifested an extensive domestic platform for e-commerce, supplying greater opportunities for drops shipping businesses to expand.

The Chinese government has established the significance of e-commerce and cross-border trade for the country&#x27;s economic development. Subsequently, the Chinese Government have instilled policies, initiatives and regulations to aid and promote the market platform of e-commerce. A distinct example can be identified when the government established special economic zones and implemented tax incentives to encourage e-commerce and export-specific industries.

== Scams ==
Drop shipping has also been a component of internet-based work-at-home schemes posted on social networking services. Scam artists will promote drop-shipping as a work-at-home scheme, in which victims will be sold a list of businesses from which drop shipment orders can be placed. These businesses may not be wholesalers, but other businesses or individuals acting as middlemen between retailers and wholesalers, with no product of their own to sell. These middlemen often charge prices that leave little profit margin for the victim and require a regular fee for use of their services. In 2019, the Gimlet Media podcast Reply All investigated the drop-shipping phenomenon, exploring the way drop shippers microtarget their client, but also found that micro-shipping itself is a rather dubious industry in that, despite the promises of some of the most well-known drop-shipping proponents, few drop shippers actually make any profits.

In 2016, &quot;Buzzfeed News&quot; published an article exposing unscrupulous drop-shippers in China, describing how customers were receiving products that were not as those were advertised, or not receiving any products at all.

One effect of drop-shipping scams is that customers who receive a drop-shipped package may realise that they overpaid for the item, return the item to the seller, then reorder the identical item directly from the manufacturer. The cost of processing the return and the loss of the unsalable returned product can result in significant losses to the drop shipper.

<text>Hespenbusch is a farm, which belongs to the municipality of Grossenkneten. Karl Poggensee and the Hermann Oberth society (succeeded by the DAFRA, German work company for affairs of rocket) operated between 1952 and 1957 a launch site for small rockets with a maximum flight level of some kilometers, close to this farm. In 1957 the launch activities were shifted toward Cuxhaven, since the available area became too small.
