<text>The Hafsids ( ) were a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Berber descent who ruled Ifriqiya (modern day Tunisia, western Libya, and eastern Algeria) from 1229 to 1574.

==History==

===Almohad Ifriqiya===
The Hafsids were of Berber descent, although to further legitimize their rule, they claimed Arab ancestry from the second Rashidun caliph Omar. The ancestor of the dynasty (from whom their name is derived), was Abu Hafs Umar ibn Yahya al-Hintati, a Berber from the Hintata tribal confederation, which belonged to the greater Masmuda confederation in present-day Morocco. He was a member of the Council of Ten, one of the highest Almohad political bodies, and a close companion of Ibn Tumart, the Almohad movement&#x27;s founder. 

The son of Abu Hafs, Abu Muhammad Abd al-Wahid ibn Abi Hafs, was appointed by the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir as governor of Ifriqiya (generally present-day Tunisia, eastern Algeria, and western Libya) where he ruled from 1207 to 1221. He was established in Tunis, which the Almohads had chosen as the province&#x27;s administrative capital. His appointment came in the wake of the defeat of Yahya Ibn Ghaniya, who had launched a serious attack against Almohad authority in the region. Abu Muhammad Abd al-Wahid was ultimately quite effective in keeping order. The caliph had granted him a significant degree of autonomy in governing, partly to help persuade him to accept this difficult position in the first place. This laid the groundwork for a future Hafsid state. 

When Abu Muhammad Abd al-Wahid died in 1221, the Almohad chiefs in Ifriqiya initially elected his son, Abu Zayd Abd al-Rahman, as the next governor. However, the Almohad caliph in Marrakesh, Yusuf II al-Mustansir, had not consented to this and was able to overrule this and appoint his own relative to the position. As Almohad authority weakened over the following years, local opposition to the Almohad governor compelled the Almohad caliph Abdallah al-Adil to appoint another Hafsid family member to the post in 1226. He chose Abu Muhammad Abdallah, a grandson of Abu Hafs. Abu Muhammad Abdallah&#x27;s brother, Abu Zakariya Yahya, arrived in Tunis before him and began to reestablish order. When al-Ma&#x27;mun, the brother of Abdallah al-Adil, rebelled against the latter&#x27;s authority from al-Andalus, Abu Zakariya sided with him, whereas Abu Muhammad Abdallah remained loyal to the caliph in Marrakesh. Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s eventual victory resulted in Abu Zakariya being placed in charge of Ifriqiya in 1228.

===Rise to power===
A year later, in 1229, al-Ma&#x27;mun officially renounced Almohad doctrine. Abu Zakariya used this as a pretext to repudiate his authority and to declare himself independent. By this point, Al-Ma&#x27;mun did not have the means to stop him or to reassert control over Ifriqiya. Initially, Abu Zakariya had his name mentioned in the &quot;khutba&quot; (the sermon during Friday prayer) with the title of amir, but in 1236 or 1237 he began to adopt the caliphal title of &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot;, in direct challenge to the Almohad caliph in Marrakesh.

Abu Zakariya annexed Constantine (Qusantina) and Béjaïa (Bijaya) in 1230. In 1234, he chased Yahya Ibn Ghaniya out of the countryside south of Constantine in 1234, ending this lingering threat. In 1235 he captured Algiers and then established his authority as far as the Chelif River to the west. In the following years he subdued various rural tribes, such as the Hawwara, but allowed some of the Banu Tujin tribes in the central Maghreb to govern themselves as small vassal states that secured his western borders. He welcomed many refugees and immigrants from al-Andalus who were fleeing the advance of the &quot;Reconquista.&quot; He appointed some of them to important political positions and recruited Andalusi military regiments as a way of counteracting the power and influence of traditional Almohad elites.

For a time, the Nasrid ruler of Granada in al-Andalus, Ibn al-Ahmar, briefly acknowledged Abu Zakariya&#x27;s suzerainty in an attempt to enlist his help against Christian forces. Ultimately, Hafsid intervention on the Iberian Peninsula was limited to sending a fleet to Muslim Valencia&#x27;s aid in 1238. Abu Zakariya showed more interest in trying to recreate some of the former authority of the Almohads over the Maghreb and he made attempts to extend his control further west. In 1242, he captured Tlemcen from the Zayyanids, but the Zayyanid leader Yaghmurasan evaded him. The two leaders eventually came to an agreement, with Yaghmurasan continuing to rule in Tlemcen but agreeing to formally recognize Abu Zakariya&#x27;s authority. That same year, Sijilmasa and Ceuta (Sabta) also recognized his authority, though these would later fall under Marinid control. This policy of western expansion ended with Abu Zakariya&#x27;s death (1249).

===Consolidation and division===
His successor, Muhammad I al-Mustansir (r. 1249–1277), focused on consolidating the Hafsid state in Ifriqiya. The state benefited from expanding trade with both Europe and the Sudan region (south of the Sahara). In the western Maghreb (present-day Morocco), the Marinids, who had not yet fully established their rule in the region, formally recognized his authority in 1258. With the fall of Baghdad, the home of the Abbasid caliphs, that same year, the Hafsids were briefly seen as the most important rulers of the Muslim world. The Sharif of Mecca, Abu Numayy, temporarily recognized him as caliph in 1259.

It was during his reign that the failed Eighth Crusade took place, led by Louis IX of France. After landing at Carthage, Louis died of dysentery in the middle of his army decimated by disease in 1270.

After al-Mustansir&#x27;s death in 1277, the Hafsids were riven by internal conflict, aggravated by interference from Aragon. This resulted in a split in the dynasty: one branch ruled from Tunis in the east and another branch ruled from Béjaïa (Bijaya) and Constantine (Qusantina) in the west. This division continued to characterize Hafsid politics for much of its history, with the balance of power sometimes shifting from one side to another and with intermittent successes at unifying both branches under one rule. After the initial split, the first successful reunification took place under Abu Yahya Abu Bakr II (), the ruler of the western branch who managed to take control of Tunis.

===Marinid invasions and internal crisis===
Abu Yahya Abu Bakr&#x27;s rule remained unstable and he resorted to making alliances with the Zayyanids and Marinids to the west. His agreement with the Marinid ruler, Abu al-Hasan (), included a marriage to his sister, who subsequently died during a failed Marinid expedition in Spain, followed by another marriage to his daughter. When Abu Yahya Abu Bakr died in 1346, his intended heir, Abu&#x27;l Abbas, was killed in Tunis by his brother, Umar, who seized power. Abu&#x27;l Abbas&#x27;s chamberlain, Abu Muhammad Abdallah ibn Tafrajin, sent a letter to Abu al-Hasan urging him to intervene and invade Ifriqiya. Abu al-Hasan, having already conquered Tlemcen in 1337, seized the opportunity to further expand. He conquered Tunis in 1347 and the Hafsid governors in the region accepted his authority. 

The invasion, however, disturbed the balance of power in favour of the Bedouin Arab tribes, whom the Marinids were unable to sway. Ibn Tafrajin, who had hoped to be placed in power by the Marinids, fled to Egypt. The situation in Ifriqiya devolved into further disorder and internal rivalries, and Abu al-Hasan was forced to return west in 1349, partly to deal with a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by his son, Abu Inan. Ibn Tafrajin returned to Ifriqiya and, with Bedouin support, installed another young son of Abu Yahya Abu Bakr, Abu Ishaq, as ruler. Abu Inan, having successfully taken the throne from his father, invaded Ifriqiya again and captured Tunis in August 1357, but he was soon forced by his own troops to abandon the region. He returned west, retaining control only of Constantine and the cities of the central Maghreb for a time.

During the mid-14th century, plague epidemics brought to Ifriqiya from Sicily caused a considerable fall in population, further weakening the Hafsid realm. To stop raids from southern tribes during plague epidemics, the Hafsids turned to the Banu Hilal to protect their rural population.

===Apogee===
After the Marinid threat ended, attempts to reunify the Hafsids failed until Abu al-Abbas Ahmad II (), the emir of Béjaïa and Constantine, conquered Tunis in 1370. A capable ruler and military leader, he reestablished Hafsid authority on stronger terms, centralizing power to a greater extent than ever before. Meanwhile, the Zayyanids and Marinids were occupied by internal matters.

Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II&#x27;s reign () was considered the apogee of Hafsid power and prosperity by contemporary writers. He further consolidated his dynasty&#x27;s power in Ifriqiya and extended his influence over the Zayyanids and Marinids (and the Wattasids who succeeded the latter).

The beginning of his reign was not easy since the cities of the south revolted against him. However, the new sultan quickly regained control: he reoccupied Tozeur (1404), Gafsa (1401), and Biskra (1402), subdued tribal power in the regions of Constantine and Béjaïa (1397–1402), and appointed governors of these regions to be elected officers. He also intervened against his western and eastern neighbors. He annexed Tripoli (1401) and Algiers (1410–1411). In 1424, he defeated the Zayyanid sultan, Abu Malik Abd al-Wahid, and placed another Zayyanid, Abu Abdallah Muhammad IV, on the throne of Tlemcen as his vassal. In 1428, the latter became embroiled in another war with Abu Malik Abd al-Wahid – who had now won his own support from the Hafsids – and was eventually replaced by yet another Zayyanid relative with Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s help in 1431. Around the same time (probably in 1426), Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz also helped to install Abd al-Haqq II on the Marinid throne in Fez – under the regency of Abu Zakariya Yahya al-Wattasi – and thus obtained from him a recognition of Hafsid suzerainty.

In 1429, the Hafsids attacked the island of Malta and took 3000 slaves, although they did not conquer the island. Kaid Ridavan was the military leader during the attack. The profits were used for a great building programme and to support art and culture. However, piracy also provoked retaliation from the Christians, which several times launched attacks and crusades against Hafsid coastal cities such as the Barbary crusade (1390), the Bona crusade (1399) and the capture of Djerba in 1423.

Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II died in 1434 during another expedition against Tlemcen. His successor, Abu &#x27;Amr &#x27;Uthman, had the longest reign of any Hafsid (). He largely continued the strong rule of his predecessors but he had to contend with greater challenges, including internal politics, restive Bedouin tribes in the south, and the Wattasids in the west.

Uthman conquered Tripolitania in 1458 and appointed a governor in Ouargla in 1463. He led two expeditions to Tlemcen in 1462 and 1466 and made the Zayyanids his vassals, while the Wattasid state in Morocco also formally accepted his authority. The entire Maghreb was thus briefly under Hafsid suzerainty.

===Fall===
In the 16th century the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the Ottoman Empire-supported Corsairs. The Ottomans conquered Tunis in 1534 and held it for one year, driving out the Hafsid ruler Moulay Hassan. A year later the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V seized Tunis, drove the Ottomans out and restored Muley Hassan as a Habsburg tributary. Due to the Ottoman threat, the Hafsids were vassals of Spain after 1535. The Ottomans again conquered Tunis in 1569 and held it for four years. Don Juan of Austria recaptured it in 1573. The Ottomans reconquered Tunis in 1574, and Muhammad VI, the last Caliph of the Hafsids, was brought to Constantinople and was subsequently executed due to his collaboration with Spain and the desire of the Ottoman Sultan to take the title of Caliph as he now controlled Mecca and Medina.

==Economy==
The Hafsids, with their location in Ifriqiya, was rich in agriculture and trade. Instead of placing the capital at inland cities such as Kairouan, Tunis was chosen as the capital due to its position on the coast as a port linking the Western and Eastern Mediterranean. Christian merchants from Europe were given their own enclaves in various cities on the Mediterranean coast, promoting trans-Mediterranean trade. Under the Hafsids, commerce and diplomatic relations with Christian Europe grew significantly, however piracy against Christian shipping grew as well, particularly during the rule of Abd al-Aziz II (1394–1434). By the mid-14th century, the population of Tunis had grown to 100,000. The Hafsids also had a large stake in trans-Saharan trade through the caravan routes from Tunis to Timbuktu and from Tripoli to sub-Saharan Africa.

==Culture==

===Intellectual activity===
The Hafsids were effective patrons of culture and education. They were the first to introduce madrasas to the Maghreb. Arabic literacy and religious education thus increased, with Kairouan, Tunis and Bijaya hosting famous university-mosques. Kairouan continued to serve as a center of the Maliki school of religious doctrine.As the political center of the country shifted to Tunis, the Great Mosque of al-Zaytuna, the city&#x27;s main mosque, became the country&#x27;s leading center of learning. Of great impact on culture were immigrants from al-Andalus, whom Abu Zakariya encouraged to come to his realm in the 13th century. Among the most important figures was the historian and intellectual, Ibn Khaldun, born in Tunis and of Andalusi descent. 

===Architecture===

The Hafsids were significant builders, particularly under the reigns of successful leaders like Abu Zakariya (r. 1229–1249) and Abu Faris (r. 1394–1434), though not many of their monuments have survived intact to the present-day. While Kairouan remained an important religious center, Tunis was the capital and progressively replaced it as the main city of the region and the main center of architectural patronage. Unlike the architecture further west, Hafsid architecture was built primarily in stone (rather than brick or mudbrick) and appears to have featured much less decoration. In reviewing the history of architecture in the western Islamic world, scholar Jonathan Bloom remarks that Hafsid architecture seems to have &quot;largely charted a course independent of the developments elsewhere in the Maghrib.&quot;

The Kasbah Mosque of Tunis was one of the first works of this period, built by Abu Zakariya (the first independent Hafsid ruler) at the beginning of his reign. Its floor plan had noticeable differences from previous Almohad-period mosques but the minaret, completed in 1233, bears very strong resemblance to the minaret of the earlier Almohad Kasbah Mosque in Marrakesh. Other foundations from the Hafsid period in Tunis include the Haliq Mosque (13th century) and the al-Hawa Mosque (1375). The Bardo Palace (today a national museum) was also begun by the Hafsids in the 15th century, and is mentioned in historical records for the first time during the reign of Abu Faris. The Hafsids also made significant renovations to the much older Great Mosque of Kairouan – renovating its ceiling, reinforcing its walls, and building or rebuilding two of its entrance gates in 1293 – as well as to the Great Mosque of al-Zaytuna in Tunis.

The Hafsids also introduced the first madrasas to the region, beginning with the Madrasa al-Shamma῾iyya built in Tunis in 1238 (or in 1249 according to some sources). This was followed by many others (almost all of them in Tunis) such as the Madrasa al-Hawa founded in the 1250s, the Madrasa al-Ma&#x27;ridiya (1282), and the Madrasa al-Unqiya (1341). Many of these early madrasas, however, have been poorly preserved or have been considerably modified in the centuries since their foundation. The Madrasa al-Muntasiriya, completed in 1437, is among the best preserved madrasas of the Hafsid period.

==Flags==
According to French historian Robert Brunschvig, the Hafsid dynasty and its founding tribe, Hintata, were represented specifically with a white flag; he states : &quot;Among the Hafsid standards carried in the parades stood out, apart, closer to the sultan and held by a man on horseback, a white standard, the &quot;victorious standard&quot; (al-alam al-mansûr). It is with good reason that some wanted to find in this white standard that of the Almohads, of the same color, reproducing in turn that which the Fatimids had adopted.&quot; Egyptian historiographer Al-Qalqashandi (d. 1418) mentioned white flags when he spoke about the Almohad flag in Tunisia, where he stated that: &quot;It was a white flag called the victorious flag, and it was raised before their sultan when riding for Eid prayers or for the movement of the makhzen slaves (which were the ordinary people of the country and the people of the markets).&quot; Historian Charles-André Julien also speaks of Hafsid sovereigns doing parades with their court while hoisting their own white standard, overshadowing multicolored flags of embroidered silk. 

The &quot;Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms&quot;, written by a Franciscan friar in the 14th century, describes the flag of Tunis as being white with a black moon at its center. Other cities within modern Tunisia and eastern Algeria were also reported having white flags with a moon.

<text>General elections were held in the Pitcairn Islands on 15 December 2004. Voters elected a mayor, a council chairman, and four councillors to sit on the island council.

==Results==
===Mayor===
For the mayoralty, Jay Warren defeated Mike Warren and the incumbent Brenda Christian, who had held the office since 8 November in an interim capacity following Governor Richard Fell&#x27;s dismissal of her brother, Steve Christian, on 29 October following his five rape convictions.

===Council chairman===
The chairmanship of the council was won by Mike Warren, who defeated Brenda Christian, Jay Warren and Pawl Warren.

===Island council===
The four ordinary councillors to be elected were Meralda Warren, Olive Christian, Carol Warren and Lea Brown. Unsuccessful candidates included Brenda Christian, Jay Warren, Mike Warren, Pawl Warren, Tom Christian, Charlene Warren, Darralyn Griffith, Vaine Peu, Daphe Warren and Nola Warren.

==Reaction==
Speaking from his British High Commission office in Wellington, New Zealand, Deputy Governor Matthew Forbes told Radio New Zealand that he welcomed Jay Warren&#x27;s election as mayor. &quot;We appointed Jay as chairman of the (island&#x27;s) internal committee in the period after the trials and before this election,&quot; Forbes said. &quot;He&#x27;s very experienced and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll make a very good mayor.&quot;

<doc id="1289737" wikidata="Q15515018" url="?curid=1289737" title="Hugh Gordon Porteus">
<text>Hugh Gordon Porteus (1906–1993) was an influential reviewer of art and literature in the London of the 1930s, and also a poet. He was an admirer of Wyndham Lewis and wrote the first critical book on him, published in 1932. Lewis portrayed Porteus as the character &quot;Rotter&quot; Parkinson in his novel &quot;Self Condemned&quot;.

==Life==
He trained as an artist, and had a particular interest in Chinese art. He dressed in an affected way, and sometimes in imitation of Wyndham Lewis, and was considered somewhat eccentric; but he was an engaging and interesting conversationalist. He was also a gossip, and the reason why George Orwell attacked Lewis as a Stalinist in &quot;Partisan Review&quot;: Lewis had joked with Roy Campbell (another gossip) about writing a book on Stalin, Campbell had mentioned this to Porteus, and Porteus told this to Orwell as factual. A Lewis disciple, he was indiscreet about his teacher.

As literary editor of &quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;, monthly magazine of the Promethean Society in the early 1930s, he boosted the career of George Barker, about whom he wrote for &quot;Scrutiny&quot;. The &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; was published from March 1931 to May 1933, and printed poetry by W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Michael Roberts. Porteus published a review there of Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Hitler&quot; (1931), that was &quot;unqualified praise&quot;. Lewis gave a public reading of his &quot;One Way Song&quot; in 1933 in Kensington Gardens, to an audience of Porteus and a flock of sheep.

He was also a long-time supporter and friend of Lawrence Durrell, whom he in 1946 compared to James Joyce and T. S. Eliot. He wrote in a hostile way about Laura Riding; and he compared John Middleton Murry in 1933 to &quot;a renegade freelance vicar&quot;, in &quot;Time and Tide&quot;.

He wrote on Barbara Hepworth, Patrick Heron and John Piper, amongst others. He was included in the Cairo poets World War II group, having been stationed with the RAF on the Suez Canal (miserably seasick on the journey out). At the end of the war Ezra Pound, held prisoner, asked for Porteus to be given the work of checking the ideograms in the &quot;Pisan Cantos&quot;. Porteus wrote a 1950 essay &quot;Ezra Pound and His Chinese Character: A Radical Examination&quot;.

Jeffrey Meyers interviewed Porteus at length while researching his (1980) biography of Wyndham Lewis and published in 2016 a memoir of Porteus.

<doc id="1289739" wikidata="Q416807" url="?curid=1289739" title="Shine–Dalgarno sequence">
<text>The Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence is a ribosomal binding site in bacterial and archaeal messenger RNA, generally located around 8 bases upstream of the start codon AUG. The RNA sequence helps recruit the ribosome to the messenger RNA (mRNA) to initiate protein synthesis by aligning the ribosome with the start codon. Once recruited, tRNA may add amino acids in sequence as dictated by the codons, moving downstream from the translational start site. 

The Shine–Dalgarno sequence is common in bacteria, but rarer in archaea. It is also present in some chloroplast and mitochondrial transcripts. The six-base consensus sequence is AGGAGG; in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, for example, the sequence is AGGAGGU, while the shorter dominates in &quot;E. coli&quot; virus T4 early genes.

The Shine–Dalgarno sequence was proposed by Australian scientists John Shine and Lynn Dalgarno in 1973.

==Recognition==

===Translation start sites===
Using a method developed by Hunt, Shine and Dalgarno showed that the nucleotide tract at the 3&#x27; end of &quot;E. coli&quot; 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (that is, the end where translation begins) is pyrimidine-rich and has the specific sequence . They proposed that these ribosomal nucleotides recognize the complementary purine-rich sequence , which is found upstream of the start codon AUG in a number of mRNAs found in viruses that affect &quot;E. coli&quot;. Many studies have confirmed that base pairing between the Shine–Dalgarno sequence in mRNA and the 3&#x27; end of 16S rRNA is of prime importance for initiation of translation by bacterial ribosomes.

Given the complementary relationship between rRNA and the Shine–Dalgarno sequence in mRNA, it was proposed that the sequence at the 3&#x27;-end of the rRNA determines the capacity of the prokaryotic ribosome to translate a particular gene in an mRNA. Base pairing between the 3&#x27;-end of the rRNA and the Shine–Dalgarno sequence in mRNA is a mechanism by which the cell can distinguish between initiator AUGs and internal and/or out-of-frame AUG sequences. The degree of base pairing also plays a role in determining the rate of initiation at different AUG initiator codons.

===Translation termination===
In 1973 Dalgarno and Shine proposed that in eukaryotes, the 3&#x27;-end of the small 18S rRNA may play a role in the termination of protein synthesis by complementary base pairing with termination codons. This came from their observation that the 3&#x27; terminal sequences of 18S rRNA from &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, and rabbit cells are identical: GAUCAUUA -3&#x27;OH. The conservation of this sequence between such distantly related eukaryotes implied that this nucleotide tract played an important role in the cell. Since this conserved sequence contained the complement of each of the three eukaryotic termination codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) it was proposed to have a role in the termination of protein synthesis in eukaryotes. A similar role for the 3&#x27; end of 16S rRNA in recognising termination triplets in &quot;E.coli &quot;was proposed in 1974 by Shine and Dalgarno on the basis of complementarity relationships between the 3&#x27;-terminal UUA-OH in 16S rRNA and &quot;E.coli&quot; termination codons. In F1 phage, a class of viruses that infect bacteria, the sequence coding for the first few amino acids often contains termination triplets in the two unused reading frames. In a commentary on this paper, it was noted that complementary base pairing with the 3&#x27;-terminus of 16S rRNA might serve to abort peptide bond formation after out-of-phase initiation.

==Sequence and protein expression==
Mutations in the Shine–Dalgarno sequence can reduce or increase translation in prokaryotes. This change is due to a reduced or increased mRNA-ribosome pairing efficiency, as evidenced by the fact that compensatory mutations in the 3&#x27;-terminal 16S rRNA sequence can restore translation.

<text>Leif Selim Segerstam ( , 2 March 1944 – 9 October 2024) was a Finnish conductor, composer, violinist, violist, and pianist, especially known for writing over 300 symphonies, along with other works.

From 1963 onward Segerstam conducted a variety of orchestras in Europe, the Americas and Australia. He was conductor at the Finnish National Opera, the Royal Swedish Opera and Deutsche Oper Berlin, and was chief conductor of the ORF Symphony Orchestra, Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, the Danish National Radio Symphony, Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra and the Turku Philharmonic Orchestra. He is widely known through his recordings, including the complete symphonies of Blomdahl, Brahms, Mahler, Nielsen, and Sibelius, as well as many works by contemporary composers. He is remembered for his contributions to the Finnish music scene, and his vibrant personality.

He taught as professor of orchestra conducting at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki.

==Life and career==
Leif Segerstam was born on 2 March 1944 in Vaasa,
to Selim Segerstam and Viola Maria Kronqvist, into a musical Swedish-speaking family. Selim made several song books as a living. The Segerstams then moved to Helsinki in 1947. During Leif&#x27;s time at school, he played the violin and the viola with the Helsinki Youth Orchestra.

Segerstam&#x27;s debut concert as a violinist was in 1962, and his conducting debut was in 1963, with Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, in Tampere. Following the premiere, Segerstam was hired to conduct the Finnish National Opera, and a year later he conducted the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. He conducted contemporary works such as Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; and Shostakovich&#x27;s First Symphony.

Segerstam studied at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, piano with Jaakko Somero, violin with Leena Siukonen-Penttilä, composition with Einar Englund and Joonas Kokkonen, and conducting with Jussi Jalas. He received diplomas in violin and conducting in 1963. He studied further at the Juilliard School in New York City, violin with Louis Persinger, composition with Hall Overton and Vincent Persichetti, and conducting with Jean Morel, and received his postgraduate diploma in 1965.

Segerstam took part, as second conductor, in a 1968 tour of the Helsinki Philharmonic to the United States. He was chief conductor and music director of the Royal Swedish Opera from 1970 to 1972, and music director of the Finnish National Opera in 1973 and 1974. He began working with Deutsche Oper Berlin in the early 1970s. He conducted as a guest at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, La Scala in Milan and the Royal Opera House in London, with a repertoire including Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; and &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, R. Strauss&#x27; &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Elektra&quot; and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and Der fliegende Holländer&quot;.

Segerstam served as chief conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from 1995 to 2007, and held the title of Chief Conductor Emeritus with the orchestra. At the same time, he was chief conductor of the Royal Swedish Opera again and of the Savonlinna Opera Festival in Finland until 2000.
He held positions with numerous other orchestras, including the ORF Symphony Orchestra (1975 to 1982), the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz (1982 to 1989), the Danish National Radio Symphony (1988 to 1995), and the Turku Philharmonic Orchestra (2012 to 2019). He guest-conducted many orchestras in Europe, the Americas and in Australia,
including the Chicago Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Toronto Symphony, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Symphony Orchestra of the State of São Paulo.

From autumn 1997 to spring 2013, he was professor of orchestra conducting at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki. His students include Rune Bergmann, Susanna Mälkki, Mikk Murdvee, Sasha Mäkilä and Markku Laakso.

In 2004 he made a cameo appearance in the Finnish film &quot;Pelicanman&quot;.

In 2024, he was hospitalized after a &quot;brief bout of pneumonia&quot;, dying after complications related to the disease at the hospital on the 9th of October of 2024.
==Compositions==

As a composer, Segerstam is especially known for his many symphonies, which numbered 371 by March 2024.
Most of his symphonies last for about 20 minutes, are formed of a single movement and can be performed without a conductor. His 37th symphony, for example, at its premiere featured Segerstam at the piano, leading the orchestra &quot;in a relatively free form&quot;. This is partially inspired by Sibelius&#x27; Seventh symphony. More than a hundred of Segerstam&#x27;s symphonies have been performed.

Many of his compositions are influenced by nature, and he was often praised for his contributions to Nordic music. He developed a personal approach to aleatory composition through a style called &quot;free pulsation&quot; in which musical events interact flexibly in time, with his composition method persistent throughout his &quot;&quot;. His Fifth String Quartet, the &quot;Lemming Quartet&quot; (1970), ushered in his new chapter of post-expressionistic writing of the 1960s. This composition approach proved to be a quick way of writing large blocks of sound (the temporal order of events being left to the performer) and permitted an exceptionally prolific output. Instead of constituting individual works, his music is more like a musical stream of consciousness (under the headings of &quot;Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Episode&quot; and &quot;Orchestral Diary Sheet&quot;). It also means that there are numerous scorings of the same piece. This method was first used in the &quot;Lemming Quartet&quot;.

Among Segerstam&#x27;s juvenilia (1960–1969) are four string quartets from 1962–1966, and the post-impressionist ballet &quot;Pandora&quot; from 1967. The quartets are usually labeled as from his &quot;Post-Expressionist&quot; period. He composed 30 string quartets and numerous concertos, for violin, viola, cello and piano.

In 2015 Segerstam began work on an opera, &quot;Völvan&quot;, with a libretto by Elisabeth Wärnfeldt.

==Personal life==
Segerstam was married to the violinist , concertmaster of the Finnish RSO; they had two children, Jan and Pia. Pia is a professional cellist; Jan is a businessman.

After they divorced, he married the Helsinki Philharmonic harpist Minnaleena Jankko in 2002; they had three children: Violaelina (born 1997), Selimoskar (born 1998) and Iirisilona (born 1999). In 2009 it was announced that their marriage would end.

In a 2024 interview, Segerstam mentioned being autistic.

Segerstam died from pneumonia at a Helsinki hospital, on 9 October 2024, at the age of 80.

<text>The Fox–North coalition was a government in Great Britain that held office during 1783. As the name suggests, the ministry was a coalition of the groups supporting Charles James Fox and Lord North. The official head was William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, who took office on 2 April 1783.

Fox was a Whig by background, and North came from the nominal Tory Party; however, both had fallen out with the government of Lord Shelburne. They combined their forces in the House of Commons to throw out Shelburne&#x27;s ministry and then form a government of their own.

King George III despised the government, and Fox in particular, but found that no other ministry could be formed at this stage despite several offers to William Pitt the Younger. Consequently, the King declined to provide the government with the normal tools of patronage, and it was forced to look elsewhere.

The Treaty of Paris was signed during this government on 3 September 1783, formally ending the American Revolutionary War. The government also came under strain when, from the opposition, Pitt introduced a proposal for electoral reform to tackle bribery and rotten boroughs. The proposal did not pass, but caused tensions within the coalition which contained both proponents and opponents of political reform.

The British East India Company was in trouble; Fox proposed nationalising it, thus providing the government with a new source of appointments so that it could reward and maintain support. The East India Bill was introduced and passed in the Commons, but the King remained deeply opposed. He informed the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was defeated on 17 December 1783 and the King immediately dismissed the coalition. It was succeeded by a government formed by William Pitt the Younger.

After being dismissed, Fox and North tried to force Pitt from power through defeat in the House of Commons, but he refused to resign. The response of opinion in the country, evidenced by petitions, resolutions of borough corporations and the actions of the London mobs, showed strong opposition to the coalition and support for Pitt. In March 1784 a general election was called in which Pitt&#x27;s government made massive gains, especially in constituencies decided by popular votes.

<text>Bentwisch is a municipality in the Rostock district, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, to the east of Rostock. Since its merger with Klein Kussewitz in January 2018, the municipality has 3,174 inhabitants and covers 29.19 square kilometres. Due to its proximity to Rostock, the B 105, and the A 19, Bentwisch became a place of industry after German reunification.

Bentwisch has a substation for 220 kV/110kV and the static inverter plant of the HVDC Kontek. Both facilities are a few kilometres away from each other. In 2002 the static inverter plant Bentwisch was enlarged by a substion for 380 kV/110kV and between the static invertor plant and the 220 kV/110 kV-substation, which was built in difference to the static invertor plant at times, East Germany existed, a 110 kV powerline for 3 phase AC was built.

<text>The Avoca () is a river in County Wicklow, Ireland. It is contained completely within the county. Its length is 35 miles (56.3 km).

The Avoca starts life as two rivers, the Avonmore () and the Avonbeg (). These join at a spot called the &quot;Meeting of the Waters&quot; (&quot;Cumar an dá Uisce&quot;) in the &quot;Vale of Avoca&quot;, which is considered a local beauty spot, and was celebrated by Thomas Moore in his song of the same name.
The village of Avoca is situated on the river.

The Avoca flows into the Irish Sea at Arklow where it widens into a large estuary, giving Arklow its Irish language name &quot;an t-Inbhear Mór&quot; (the big inlet).
The catchment area of the Avoca is 652 km2.
The long term average flow rate of the Avoca is 20.2 cubic metres per second (m3/s)

==Name==
The Avoca was originally called Abhainn Mhór / Abhainn Dé (great river/God&#x27;s river); the present name was derived from &quot;Oboka&quot; (), the name of a river in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, which was thought to correspond to the Avoca (Ovoca). However, &quot;Oboka&quot; more likely refers to the Liffey.

==Industry==
The valley of the Avoca has a large copper mine, and further downstream was the NET fertiliser factory (closed since 2002). These are said to have contributed greatly to pollution in the lower reaches of the river.

==Transport==
The railway line from Dublin to Rosslare also passes along the Vale of Avoca, cutting inland from its mainly coastal route and the R752 road tightly follows the west bank of the Avoca from &quot;The Meetings&quot; to Arklow.

<text>Avoca () is a small town near Arklow, in County Wicklow, Ireland. It is situated on the River Avoca.

The Avoca area has been associated with its copper mines for many years and the valley has been celebrated by Thomas Moore in the song &quot;The Meeting of the Waters&quot;. The name of the song derives from the meeting of the Avonmore and Avonbeg rivers, about 3 kilometres from the village of Avoca. The song is said to have been written under a tree, the stump of which remains by the Meetings. Avoca is also famous for its handweaving, with Avoca Handweavers based there.

Avoca has been used as a filming location for several films and television series. The BBC series &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; was filmed there. In 1967, Avoca was one of the locations used in the film &quot;Jules Verne&#x27;s Rocket to the Moon&quot;, and it was the setting for the comedy film &quot;Zonad&quot; which had a general Irish release in 2010.

The red kite, recently reintroduced to Ireland, is now commonly seen in and around Avoca.

==Toponymy==
Avoca was once known as Newbridge. It subsequently became known as Ovoca, and then in Victorian times as Avoca. Ptolemy mentions the river Oboka on his early map of Ireland. The official name of the village is now Avoca in English and in Irish. None of the other names are used today.

==Mining==
Copper mining is reported to have begun in the Avoca River valley around 1720 and it continued, with interruptions, until 1982. Earlier mining, perhaps dating back to the Bronze Age, may have occurred. The East Avoca site, today, is composed mainly of a number of rock waste spoil heaps, abandoned quarries (Cronebane and East Avoca open pits) and disused roads. The largest spoil heap, Mount Platt, was built up from waste rock excavated from Cronebane open pit. There was a mineral tramway built from the West Avoca mines, through the village (on the opposite side of the river) and on to Arklow Harbour. The route of most of this was subsumed into the Dublin-Rosslare railway line, but an arch and a tunnel under the road from Rathdrum to Avoca remains.
==Transport==
Avoca lies on the R752 regional road linking Rathnew with Woodenbridge. The village is served by Bus Éireann route 133 from Dublin (66 km) and Wicklow (21 km) to Arklow (10 km), with two departures in each direction on Mondays to Saturdays and one each way on Sundays.

There has been some local political pressure to reopen Avoca railway station, from which passenger services were withdrawn on 3 March 1964, almost 101 years after its opening, on the Dublin-Rosslare railway line, on 18 July 1863.

==International relations==

Avoca has a town twinning agreement with Bromham, Wiltshire in England.

<text>St Lawrence Church is the Church of England parish church for Morden in the London Borough of Merton. The building is Grade I listed, and located on London Road, at the highest point of Morden, overlooking Morden Park.
Morden Parish consists of four churches in total, the other three are Emmanuel (Stonecot Hill), St Martin&#x27;s (Lower Morden) and St George&#x27;s (Central Road, Morden).

== Building ==

=== History ===

St Lawrence Church was built in 1636. It is probable that it replaced an earlier building. The nearby Merton Abbey was closed by Henry VIII as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the estate sold. Edward Whitchurch and Lionel Dutchet purchased it, but left for Europe when Queen Mary came to the throne. The site then came into the ownership of the Garth family.

===Exterior===
The building is designed in Gothic style and features stone dressings and a red tiled, steeply pitched roof. The exterior is mainly of red brick. The church features an aisleless, 4-bay nave which has pointed, two-light windows. The nave continues into the short chancel. There is a square, 3 stage west tower and a projecting south west porch with a pointed arched and moulded doorway, later restored in 1887. The north vestry was added in 1805. There is a &#x27;Y&#x27; tracery, cusped four-light east window with later perpendicular tracery.

=== Interior ===
The interior walls of St Lawrence are plastered and whitewashed. There are exposed tie beams and king posts under the circular shaped roof. The west gallery was added in 1792. There is an original stained and painted glass window to the east which features a design of Moses and Aaron, and various wall monuments. The interior features an inlaid timber pulpit, which originates from 1720 and has sounding-board over it for amplification. The tower houses three bells which, owing to restrictions placed by Historic England in order to preserve the frame, can only be tolled.

==Activities==
There are services every Sunday at 9:00am, 10:30am, and 6:30pm. The 10:30am service has children&#x27;s activities - the children join in the first part of the service before leaving for Sunday Club.

== Leadership and staff ==
* Revd David Heath-Whyte - Team Rector
* The Rt Revd Precious Omuku — honorary curate. Omuku is an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Southwark, having been consecrated bishop in South Sudan on 3 January 2016.

<text>Luigi Lucioni (born Giuseppe Luigi Carlo Benevenuto Lucioni; November 4, 1900 – July 22, 1988) was an Italian American painter known for his still lifes, landscapes, and portraits.

==Early life==
===Early years and immigration to the United States===
Luigi Lucioni was born on November 4, 1900, in Malnate, Italy, which lies in a mountainous region approximately 30 miles north of Milan, in the foothills of the Alps near the border between Italy and Switzerland. Lucioni&#x27;s parents, Angelo and Maria Beati Lucioni, who were married in 1890, were from the nearby region of Castiglione Olona, as were Lucioni&#x27;s grandparents. Lucioni had three older sisters: Angela (b. 1891), Alice (b. 1893) and Aurora (b. 1897), and the family lived in a two-room apartment with no gas, running water or a bathtub. As Lucioni&#x27;s grandmother was upset by the &quot;pagan&quot; names given to his sisters, his parents named him Giuseppe Luigi Carlo Benevenuto Lucioni, naming him after three saints, in order to make amends with her. Lucioni, who was greatly influenced by his strict disciplinarian mother, called her &quot;La Bella Beati&quot;, or a beautiful blonde woman. His father Angelo was a coppersmith, but was not a good businessman, and often did not follow through by collecting from his customers. As was customary, Lucioni wore skirts until he was six years old, and clearly remembered wearing pants for the first time during a church holiday in 1906. As a child, Lucioni came to adore the natural beauty of the hills and mountainsides when he explored the region between Malnate and the Swiss border, and showed an early interest in art, in particular drawing, possibly influenced by a cousin of his father&#x27;s, who also harbored a talent for drawing. Lucioni&#x27;s first classes were in geometrical drawing, and at age six, his talent caught the attention of his teacher, Miss Gadisco, a woman from Varese who had some artistic training herself, and who encouraged him to pursue drawing and etching as a career.

Members of the Lucionis extended family had emigrated to the Transvaal Colony in Africa and to South America, which was a favored destination of northern Italians at the time, and because of the poor economy of 1900s Italy. 40-year-old Angelo emigrated to New York City in 1906, and after establishing himself as a coppersmith and tinsmith, sent for the rest of the family. Maria, having heard about the &quot;savages and Indians&quot; in the United States, took Lucioni to Milan, his first time in a big city, where he was confirmed in the Duomo in order to protect his soul. On July 15, 1911, the family boarded the ship &quot;Duke of Genoa&quot; for the U.S. Despite traveling steerage, Lucioni recalled the trip as &quot;really nice&quot;. After being quarantined for nine days in the sweltering August heat in New York Harbor with 350 other third class passengers due to a cholera report, the ship landed at 34th Street pier on August 9, and the family was transferred to Ellis Island. While being processed there, they had to have several injections, and the embarrassment of having to expose her derrière in front of strangers caused the very modest and sensitive Angela to nearly have a nervous breakdown. The family then moved in with Angelo in the apartment he rented on Christopher Street in Manhattan.

Maria, who had never lived in a large city, took an immediate dislike to living in New York, and threatened to return to Malnate if the family did not move to a smaller town. On the suggestion of an American that the family had met on the &quot;Duke of Genoa&quot;, the family moved to North Bergen, New Jersey, and then several more times before settling in 1929 at 403 New York Avenue in Union City, New Jersey. Lucioni spent four years learning English on the streets of his newly adopted country, and was not placed in first grade until age 11. His life as an American was initially difficult for him, as he endured some bigotry from neighborhood children who called him a &quot;guinea wop&quot;. He was made to scrub the home&#x27;s wooden floor on his hands and knees, and not permitted to go out and play until this task was completed, which he credited with instilling in him a sense of discipline that served him well in his artistic life.

===Education and early career===
Lucioni advanced through his grades and won an academic medal in 1916. After completing the eighth grade, he did not attend school until college. He did take drawing lessons for several years at a drawing school where he worked every night after his studies concluded, copying the plaster heads. He left the school after he refused to acknowledge an instructor&#x27;s criticism of his perspective. At age 15, Lucioni entered a competition for admission to Cooper Union and was accepted, taking evening classes while working at a Brooklyn engraving company during the day. The school curriculum was divided into four years, in which he would study geometric shapes, then drawing heads, then antiquities and then finally, drawing from life. For painting, he studied under William de Leftwich Dodge. As Lucioni recalls it, Dodge was initially not interested in Lucioni&#x27;s work, and made his feelings known, but was kind and gentle, and allowed Lucioni to visit his studio on West 9th Street, where Lucioni received sound criticism. Lucioni cites Dodge as an influence in his own realization that one&#x27;s belief in oneself is the key to fully realize one&#x27;s own artistic vision, and not the adoption of contemporary trends in art or catering to others&#x27; expectations, a theme that Lucioni would express in his career. At age 19, Lucioni entered New York City&#x27;s National Academy of Design, where he was introduced to the medium of etching through his instructor in that discipline, William Auerbach-Levy. Lucioni attended school in the morning, and worked in the art department at Fairchild Publications, which published &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;. He also took composition classes at Cooper Union.

During this time Lucioni lived at home, where his father&#x27;s $20 a week salary allowed Lucioni, who never felt poor, to buy a new suit each Easter, though he and Angelo never developed a strong rapport, due to their separation between 1906 and 1911, and the fact that Angelo never learned English. In 1922, Lucioni took his father to his first opera, &quot;Aida&quot;, but his father was indifferent, and never came to share Lucioni&#x27;s passion for opera. When Maria died in 1922, a great loss for Lucioni, her domestic duties were taken over by Aurora and Alice. Though Lucioni was devoted to Alice, he never formed a very close relationship with Angela, due to the differences in their ages. Angela joined a convent for some period of time, but left due to poor health, dying in 1926 at the age of 34. Lucioni, Alice and Aurora lived in a town house at 33 West 10th Street in New York during the winters, and at a farmhouse in Manchester, Vermont in the summer. Aurora died in 1981 and Alice in 1983.

==Career==

Lucioni&#x27;s work was marketed through Associated American Artists in New York.

Lucioni&#x27;s portrait of Paul Cadmus was included in the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s show &quot;Youth and Beauty: Art of the American Twenties&quot; (winter 2010–2011) and was reproduced for the show&#x27;s poster.

In 1938, Lucioni met Ethel Waters through their mutual friend, Carl Van Vechten. After several months, Lucioni asked Waters if he could paint her portrait and she readily agreed so a sitting was arranged at his studio on Washington Square. Waters bought the finished portrait from Lucioni in 1939 for $500. Waters was at the height of her career in 1939, at that time, she was the first African American to have a starring role on Broadway and was already a jazz and blues legend. In her portrait, Waters wears a beautifully tailored red dress with an elegant mink coat draped over the back of her chair. Not until one actually views this portrait in person can one feel the human emotion that Lucioni so deftly articulated on canvas. He positioned Waters with her arms tightly wrapped around her waist, a gesture that conveys a sense of vulnerability as if she were trying to protect herself. Intentional or not, this gesture is aptly symbolic of the challenges she faced as an impoverished African American woman growing up in a social climate of racial and gender discrimination.

In 2017, the Huntsville Museum of Art (HMA) acquired the historic &quot;Portrait of Ethel Waters.&quot; HMA Executive Director, Christopher J. Madkour, and Luigi Lucioni Historian, Dr. Stuart Embury, heard of the painting and were able to track down its whereabouts. The painting was thought to be lost since it had not been viewed by the public since 1942, but the two traced it to a private residence in 2016 and learned the family had plans to auction the painting off in the coming months. The owner graciously allowed the Huntsville Museum of Art to display &quot;Portrait of&quot; &quot;Ethel Waters&quot; in the exhibition, &quot;American Romantic: The Art of Luigi Lucioni,&quot; where it was viewed by the public for the first time in over 70 years. The museum successfully negotiated the purchase of &quot;Portrait of&quot; &quot;Ethel Waters&quot; and, thanks in large part to the generosity of the Huntsville community, Lucioni&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of&quot; &quot;Ethel Waters&quot; now has a new home at the Huntsville Museum of Art in Huntsville, Alabama where it will be made accessible for public viewing.

<text>Morden Park is an area within the district of Morden in the London Borough of Merton, and includes the Park itself, an area of green space in an otherwise dense cluster of 1930s suburban housing.

The present park and sports fields between Hillcross Avenue, London Road/Epsom Road and Lower Morden Lane are owned and managed by the London Borough of Merton parks department and cover land that previously formed the grounds of Morden Park House, a small 18th-century country estate (not to be confused with Morden Hall Park, the National Trust property close to Morden town centre).

==History==
The estate originally comprised enclosed parkland, a small Georgian country house built at the top of the hill in the 1770s for merchant and distiller John Ewart with attached landscaped gardens and a farm called Morden Park Farm. By the mid-1780s the estate was in the possession of the Polhill family. One member of the family, Edward Polhill, bequeathed £1,000 in 1826 to the parish church for the benefit of the Sunday school.

Between the 1880s and the 1910s the estate was occupied by banker John Wormald.

The entrance to the Park, from London Road is now dominated by South Thames College, Merton Campus. This was built on the site of a Pig Farm which was destroyed by fire at some point in the late 1940s or early 1950s. The derelict sites remained in place for some years until the early 1960s when clearing began for the College. During this period many bones could be found amongst the rubble; these have been assumed by archaeologists to be those of pigs. Children from the Council Estate opposite the entrance at Hatfield Mead used this area as an adventure playground for many years. At this period a Gatehouse (occupied until its demolition in the 1960s) was prominent at the entry.

Bordering the park to the South West, next to The George Inn was the RG Jones Recording Studios where a number of Pop Groups in the 60&#x27;s (including notably The Rolling Stones) had recording sessions.

==Geography==
At the bottom of the hill in the direction of Lower Morden runs a small brook.

A large circular mound in the park has been identified as a possible burial mound from the Iron Age, Roman or Saxon periods. Archaeological investigations were carried out in the 1950s although no conclusive proof as to its date or purpose were found. English Heritage believes that the earthwork was remodelled at some time into a belvedere, or viewing platform, with a spiral path to ascend it. Between 1960 and the mid-1990s a cycle speedway track sat alongside the mound, which was home to Morden Cycle Speedway Club. The track has since been demolished but it&#x27;s still possible to find signs of the track&#x27;s existence. A local Aero Modelling Club used the area South of the Mound on Sunday Mornings for flying practice.

==Amenities==

Morden Park House remains and, after many years of neglect and semi-dereliction, has recently been restored and is now the local register office and a venue for wedding ceremonies.

<text>Chevelle Lynvette Hallback (born September 3, 1971) is a female boxer from Plant City, Florida. Hallback, nicknamed &quot;Fist of Steel&quot;, has been featured on television many times, usually fighting the biggest names in the sport. Hallback is among the most recognized female boxers in the world.

==Career==
Hallback began her professional boxing career on February 21, 1997, beating Connie Plosser by a first round knockout in Miami. 
In just her second fight, Hallback faced Lucia Rijker, who many considered the best pound-for-pound female boxer in the world at the time. Hallback was defeated by Rijker on March 22, losing by a fifth round technical knockout. Although she lost the fight, Hallback gave Rijker some trouble before Rijker&#x27;s experience and conditioning edge took over.

After two consecutive wins, she fought for her first world title, and, on February 6, 1998, she became the WIBF&#x27;s world Featherweight champion by knocking out Bonnie Canino in seven rounds.

In 1999, she only had one fight, which resulted in a non-title defense win. She challenged for her second world title, the IFBA world Jr. Lightweight title, when she faced Doris Hackl on April 26, 2000 in Kenner, Louisiana. Hallback failed to win the title by dropping a ten round majority decision to Hackl. Many people who saw that fight, including the TV commentators, thought Hallback did enough to win the fight.
Her next fight was also very important, as she faced Laura Serrano on July 8, 2001 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Despite having been out of the ring for fifteen months before this fight, Hallback lost a six round majority decision to the Mexican fighter.

Four months later, on November 16, she fought for the WIBA world Jr. Lightweight title, in Austin, Texas, against Snodene Blakeney but had to settle for a 2nd round technical draw when Blakeney was accidentally cut by a headbutt. This was followed by two back to back wins over Brenda Drexel.

After two more wins, including a fourth round knockout of Drexel in their third bout, she challenged Alicia Ashley for the IBA world Jr. Lightweight title, on August 27, 2002, at Savannah, Georgia. Hallback outpointed Ashley over ten rounds.

Her next three bouts were non title affairs, and Hallback won each of them in two rounds or less.

She would have defended her IBA world Jr. Lightweight title for the first time on December 28, 2002, against Layla McCarter in Savannah. McCarter, however, suffered an injury during training one week prior to the fight. The promoters could not find an opponent, and McCarter decided to go on with the fight as scheduled, but the IBA decided it would be another non-title fight. Hallback won by a ten round unanimous decision.

Next, Hallback faced the ex-welterweight champ Mitzi Jeter twice in a row, beating her each time by six round unanimous decisions. On May 31, 2003, she met Britt Van Buskirk, winning by a six round decision, and Brenda Drexel for a fourth time, defeating Drexel by a six round decision.

Her next fight, against Melissa Del Valle, was a long-awaited match-up. Hallback retained the IBA Jr. Lightweight title with a ten round unanimous decision on August 30, and she followed that victory with a first round knockout win over Michelle Ewing.

Her luck ran out, however, when she moved up 10 pounds and 2 weight classes to meet Mary Jo Sanders on May 20, 2004, for the IBA continental Jr. Welterweight title, when she lost a ten round decision to the much bigger Sanders.

Hallback returned to 130 pounds, and back to her winning ways June 4, when she was rematched with Canino, in Oregon. Hallback won by a fourth round knockout.

Her next fight was another rematch, as she was finally able to defend her IBA Jr. Lightweight title against McCarter, on July 2, at San Diego, California. Hallback retained the title by a ten round unanimous decision.

Hallback then travelled to Tokyo Japan, and on March 13, 2005, she beat Emiko Raika by 10 round unanimous decision to win the WIBA Super Featherweight World Title.

On November 18, 2005, in Edmonton Alberta Canada, Hallback won a 10-round unanimous decision over Belinda Laracuente, defending her WIBA title.

On 7 May 2011, she will face the undefeated Norwegian boxer, Cecilia Brækhus, in Copenhagen.

<text>Oswell Blakeston was the pseudonym of Henry Joseph Hasslacher (1907–1985), a British writer and artist who also worked in the film industry, made some experimental films, and wrote extensively on film theory. He was also a poet and wrote in non-fiction areas including travel, cooking and pets. His pseudonym combined a reference to the writer Osbert Sitwell with his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

==Life==
Blakeston was born to a family of Austrian origin. At age 16 he ran away, becoming a conjuror&#x27;s assistant, a cinema organist and studio clapperboy.

Blakeston joined the staff of &quot;Close Up&quot;, the magazine of the Pool Group, in August 1927. While at &quot;Close Up&quot;, he very much became a protégé of Kenneth Macpherson, the publication&#x27;s editor, and contributed more articles than any other single writer—a total of 84; he contributed to all but four of the journal&#x27;s issues. While writing for &quot;Close Up&quot;, he worked in a variety of capacities in the British film industry and was for a time an assistant cameraman at Gaumont Studios.

In 1930, he made the short abstract film &quot;Light Rhythms&quot; with Francis Bruguière, long thought to be lost but which is now recovered.

He then edited the little magazine &quot;Seed&quot; with Herbert Jones, and wrote detective fiction with Roger Burford, under the pseudonym &#x27;Simon&#x27;. From 1929, he also published novels and stories under the Blakeston name, producing 15 books of fiction, as well as 10 collections of poetry. The novels are wide-ranging, and include a number of works that mix gay themes with suspense and detective plots.

Blakeston was a contributor to John Gawsworth&#x27;s anthologies, and a collaborator of M. P. Shiel. He also authored a number of travel books. According to the obituary of his partner Max Chapman, Blakeston achieved a number of firsts: his book &quot;Magic Aftermath&quot; (1932) was &quot;the first fiction to be published in spiral binding&quot; and his 1935 crime story &quot;The Cat with the Moustache&quot; (a collaboration with Burford) was &quot;one of the first descriptions of trips with mescal&quot;. In his 1938 anthology &quot;Proems&quot;, Blakeston &quot;published the first poems by Lawrence Durrell&quot;.

In the 1950s he was a contributor to &quot;ArtReview&quot;, then titled &quot;Art News and Review&quot;.

Blakeston&#x27;s work was produced for small presses and specialty publishers and is no longer in print. The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin is home to an archive of Blakeston materials available to researchers.

Many of Blakeston&#x27;s books are dedicated to his longtime partner, the artist Max Chapman, who also provided illustrations or photographs for a number of the volumes.

== Art ==
Blakeston was an artist with a &quot;quick eye for the bizarre and the outrageous” according to Max Chapman. His art mixed abstract and expressionist imagery and tended to be small scale. Blakeston had over 40 solo shows, including in London at New Vision Centre, Drian and Grabowski galleries, and some 100 mixed shows at others such as the Leicester, Madden and Mercury galleries. In 1981 he shared an exhibition at Middlesbrough Art Gallery with Max Chapman and after his death, a memorial show was held in 1986 at Camden Arts Centre. Blakeston&#x27;s work can be found in public collections including the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art and the Ulster Museum in Belfast, as well as national galleries in Finland, Poland and Portugal.

<text>Joseph Francis Charles Rock (1884 – 1962) was an Austrian-American botanist, explorer, geographer, linguist, ethnographer and photographer.

==Life==
Josef Franz Karl Rock was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of a steward of a Polish count. As a result of a generally unhappy childhood and his father&#x27;s determination that he become a priest, Rock set off on a wandering life in late adolescence. After a few precarious years traveling around Europe, he emigrated to the United States in 1905. He eventually ended up in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1907, where he would remain for 13 years. Although Rock had no tertiary education, a fact about which he was sensitive and often dissembled, he had a remarkable capability for foreign languages; by the time he reached Hawaii he had a reasonable command of more than half a dozen, including Chinese.

===Hawaii (1907-1920)===

Initially Rock taught Latin and natural history at Mills College (now known as Mid-Pacific Institute). With little formal background in the latter subject, he quickly trained himself as a botanist and became the leading authority on Hawaiian flora. Despite his lack of credentials, in 1908 he talked himself into a job to develop the first herbarium in Hawaii for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, collecting enormous numbers of plants from his explorations around the islands. In 1911, the herbarium was transferred to the College of Hawaii (later the University of Hawaii) with Rock as its first curator and the Territory of Hawaii&#x27;s first official botanist. During his time in Hawaii, Rock produced dozens of scholarly articles and five books, among which &quot;Indigenous Trees of the Hawaiian Islands&quot; (1913), in particular, is considered a classic work in its field. In 1913 Rock was part of a small expedition to the remote Palmyra Atoll, which resulted in the publication of a comprehensive description of its flora.

===Botanical Expeditions in China (1920-1933)===

In 1920 Rock left Hawaii for what would prove to be decades of residence and expeditions in Asia, mostly in Western China. The U.S. Department of Agriculture employed him as an agricultural explorer, sending him to Southeast Asia in search of seeds of the Chaulamoogra tree (&quot;Hydnocarpus wightianus&quot;), which was used in the treatment of leprosy. This success led to further expeditions in southwest China, and in 1922 Rock first arrived in Lijiang in the northwest of Yunnan province, the center of the Nakhi (Naxi) people. The valley of Lijiang is dominated by the Yulong range, at whose foot Rock established a residence in the village of Nguluko. This would be his primary base for the next 27 years, as he organized botanical expeditions throughout much of western China along the eastern borderlands of Tibet, a large, remote and very rugged area with numerous non-Han peoples for the most part only nominally governed by the Chinese government. Throughout the period Rock was in China, the country was wracked by warlordism, civil war, the war with Japan and finally the triumph of Mao Zedong&#x27;s communist forces. Western China was parceled out into a colorful array of petty states and tribal territories, and infested with banditry, a well established way of life throughout these areas.

Nevertheless, Rock managed to collect and send back to his sponsors in the U.S. large quantities of plant and bird specimens, as well as many thousands of photographs of geographical, botanical, ethnographic and historical interest. Working with a group of Nakhi assistants, many of whom remained with him for decades, Rock was a superb collector, both in the quantity and quality of his seed and plant specimens. Since he came relatively late in terms of botanical exploration to one of the most bio-diverse regions of the world, he discovered relatively few new plant species, but many superior specimens to what had previously been available in the West. His style of expeditions typically involved large caravans, which besides the necessary provisions and equipment for storing his specimens and photography, included a personal cook, table with complete dinner setting, a portable bathtub and a phonograph. Usually an armed escort was a necessary addition against bandits or hostile tribes and had to be arranged for with each local authority. These expeditions were carried out over the course of the 1920s, financed by various prestigious institutions.

For the first few years based in Lijiang, Rock carried out expeditions mostly in the northern regions of Yunnan sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution. Beginning in Dec. 1924, Rock set off on his most ambitious expedition lasting over three years sponsored by Harvard&#x27;s Arnold Arboretum. The primary purpose was to collect plant and bird specimens in Gansu province, around Kokonor (Qinghai Lake) and in the Amnye Machen mountain range. For much of this time he based himself in Choni (Jonê County), Gansu as the guest of the prince or chieftain (&quot;tusi&quot;) of this small Tibetan kingdom, and his explorations included visits to the great Kumbum, Labrang and Rakya Tibetan monasteries. The entire region was wracked by warlordism and ferocious Tibetan-Muslim conflicts. Rock witnessed some of the brutal consequences of the Golok rebellions when the Warlord general Ma Qi&#x27;s Chinese Muslim army campaigned against the fiercely independent nomadic Goloks and ravaged the Labrang Monastery. Rock finally left Choni in March 1927, but not before acquiring from Choni&#x27;s famous printing press complete sets of the &quot;Kanjur&quot; and &quot;Tanjur&quot; canon of Tibetan Buddhist scriptures, 317 volumes in total, printed from 18th century wood blocks considered among the very finest quality. The following year Choni was sacked, the monastery and its ancient press burnt to the ground in the Muslim conflict in Gansu (1927–1930) by a Muslim army. This was the most important of a number of significant Tibetan texts Rock acquired for the Library of Congress collection.

When the Arnold Arboretum declined to finance a return expedition, Rock found sponsorship from the National Geographic Society to make a number of trips to southwest Sichuan to explore both the Konkaling range and Minya Konka (Mount Gongga). The latter is among the highest mountains outside of the Himalayas and was particularly difficult of access, not least because of the purported hostility of the local tribes. Rock approached closer to Minya Konka than any other Westerner and with characteristic romantic exaggeration declared it to be higher than Everest, although at the time he was not alone in this wishful miscalculation. During these explorations, Rock based himself in the lama kingdom of Muli, which he had first visited in 1924. Another small kingdom that he often visited, also in southwest Sichuan, was Yongning on the beautiful Lugu Lake, center of the Mosuo people. These explorations produced a series of articles for the &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, although the editors were hard pressed to reshape them, much to his annoyance, for their more popular readership and to off-set Rock&#x27;s propensity for accumulative detail over coherent presentation. Nonetheless, he published a significant number of articles on little known areas and exotic peoples and customs of Western China accompanied by his excellent photographs.

===Studies of the Nakhi===

Despite the scale of his botanical collecting, for which he primarily received his funding, Rock published nothing on the flora of China (although later he did work on a large phytogeographical study, partially published posthumously). By the end of the 1920s, his attention turned decisively to the culture of the Nakhi people. He wrote a two volume cultural history of the Nakhi and many studies of the texts and ritual ceremonies of the Dongba, a term that refers to both the religious texts and the shaman priests who composed them. The Nakhi Dongba were prolific composers of recitation texts using a unique script typically described as pictographic, although it is better understood as a rebus-like mnemonic device that complexly combines iconic and phonetic elements. The script required intensive training to be read or interpreted, and therefore was strictly for religious purposes and largely comprehensible only by the Dongba themselves. Rock worked with a number of dongba priests to produce transcriptions and detailed readings of the most important ceremonial texts, as well as a dictionary-encyclopedia. While not the first to study the dongba script and rituals, his work is still considered the foundation of subsequent scholarship. He also collected numerous manuscripts or &quot;books&quot; and is responsible for the large majority (over 7,000) of the Nakhi works that exist outside of China, a third of all surviving Nakhi texts, huge numbers of which were destroyed particularly during the Cultural Revolution.

With onset of World War II, Japanese aggression forced the Nationalist government of China to retreat to the far interior and Yunnan became a central supply point. During the war years, Rock was in and out of Lijiang, often undecided whether to stay and continue his Nakhi research or to leave. He spent a year in southern Vietnam, which gave him a relatively stable circumstance for writing until further Japanese advances forced him out. In 1944 the U.S. Army Map Service employed him for his geographic expertise on the Yunnan section of the exceptionally hazardous route designated &quot;The Hump,&quot; over which the Allies flew in supplies from India to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s forces in western China. Rock shipped his manuscripts prepared for publication and much of his collection to safety in Europe, but all were lost when the ship was torpedoed in the Arabian Sea. Fortunately the Harvard-Yenching Institute offered him support to return to Lijiang and reconstruct his work on the Nakhi. Working furiously despite serious medical problems, he was able to recreate and augment his lost work. However, in the aftermath of the defeat of Japan, communist forces soon took control of Lijiang (which had not been reached by the Japanese), making life increasingly difficult for the few foreigners residing there, and Rock left with his collections and manuscripts for the last time in August 1949.

===Last Years (1949-1962)===

Initially he based himself in Kalimpong, India hoping the situation would settle down and allow him to return to Lijiang. Once he realized that China was closed to him for good, he characteristically spent his last years wandering between Europe, the U.S. and Hawaii, often selling his considerable personal library and collections to support himself and to see his work into print. Finally settling in Honolulu, he continued his extensive Nakhi researches and renewed his enthusiasm for Hawaiian flora. He completed his monumental &quot;A Nakhi-English Dictionary Encyclopedia&quot;, both a dictionary of the Dongba script and an encyclopedia of Nakhi culture, and arranged for its publication in the year of his death in 1962. He died in Honolulu where he is buried.

==Character==
Rock never married, and there is no clear evidence that he ever had an intimate relationship of any kind. He kept detailed diaries and journals throughout much of his life, which frequently express his sense of loneliness—hardly surprising given his choice to live in remote, alien environments; but he clearly prized his independence and individual self-esteem above personal relations. Emotionally volatile and autocratic in manner, he had a well-deserved reputation as a difficult character, which was counter-balanced by his effectiveness in carrying out extremely challenging and often dangerous projects and the high quality of his work as collector, photographer and scholar. He generally viewed the Chinese harshly and temperamentally sided with the non-Han peoples among whom he lived and explored, who had been pushed into these remote areas by Chinese&#x27;s insatiable need for all good cultivatable land. Nonetheless, he viewed these tribal peoples as primitive, hopelessly mired in filthy social habits and medieval, usually cruel and corrupt social structures. There is a frequent pattern of declaring he wished to leave China for good, but usually a few weeks back in the West, living in luxury hotels, was enough for him to escape from what he disparagingly referred to as &quot;civilization.&quot; Similarly, there were many times when he decided to invite another Westerner to assist and accompany him on his expeditions (in one instance a young Edgar Snow), but usually they only lasted days before Rock sent them back in exasperation, swearing never to repeat the experiment. However, Rock developed a real affection and admiration for the Nakhi, who he tended to see as a comparatively unspoiled people, and in the later years of his time in China repeatedly declared his wish to live out his life in Lijiang.

==Legacy==
In 1913, botanist Anton Heimerl published &quot;Rockia&quot;,which is a genus of flowering plants from Hawaii belonging to the family Nyctaginaceae, it was named in Joseph Rock&#x27;s honour.

Also, a number of plant species are named after Rock, including the Hawaiian endemic species &quot;Brighamia rockii&quot; of Molokai and &quot;Peperomia rockii&quot;; at Palmyra Atoll, the &quot;Pandanus Rockii&quot; , the spectacular Rock&#x27;s Tree Peony, &quot;Paeonia rockii,&quot; from the Gansu mountains, and the yellow-berried mountain ash &quot;Sorbus rockii&quot; .

In March 2009, the University of Hawaii at Manoa named its herbarium, which he had founded and developed, in his honor.

Rock&#x27;s former residence at Nguluko (Yuhu) village has been made into a museum in his memory.

The American poet Ezra Pound (1885–1972) discovered Rock&#x27;s work on the Nakhi in the 1950s and incorporated various details into the late sections of his enormous long poem, &quot;The Cantos&quot;, as well as mentioning Rock himself: &quot;And over Li Chiang, the snow range is turquoise / Rock&#x27;s world that he saved us for memory / a thin trace in high air.&quot;

<doc id="1289792" wikidata="Q722229" url="?curid=1289792" title="KWL table">
<text>A KWL table, or KWL chart, is a graphical organizer designed to help in learning. The letters KWL are an acronym, for what students, in the course of a lesson, already know, want to know, and ultimately learn. It is a part of the constructivist teaching method where students move away from what are considered traditional methods of teaching and learning. In this particular methodology the students are given the space to learn by constructing their own learning pace and their own style of understanding a given topic or idea. The KWL chart or table was developed within this methodology and is a form of instructional reading strategy that is used to guide students taking them through the idea and the text. A KWL table is typically divided into three columns titled Know, Want and Learned. The table comes in various forms as some have modified it to include or exclude information.

It may be useful in research projects and to organize information to help study for tests.

==Classroom introduction==
The KWL chart was created by Donna Ogle in 1986. A KWL chart can be used for all subjects in a whole group or small group atmosphere. The chart is a comprehension strategy used to activate background knowledge prior to reading and is completely student centered. The teacher divides a piece of chart paper into three columns. The first column, &#x27;K&#x27;, is for what the students already know about a topic. This step is to be completed before the reading. The next column, &#x27;W&#x27;, is for students to list what they want to learn about the topic during the reading. This step is also to be completed before the reading. The third column, &#x27;L&#x27;, is for what the students learned from the reading. This step, of course, is done after finishing the reading. The KWL chart can also be used in reading instruction at the beginning of a new unit.

Here is what the KWL chart can look like: 
=== Things to keep in mind ===

Materials required can vary on the type of classroom activity the teacher intends to carry. For a classroom activity if the teacher divides the class for a particular topic then 1 paper with KWL chart per group shall be given. But if the teacher wants every individual child to brainstorm on the given topic then every individual shall have their own student paper copy.

In the &#x27;K&#x27; column, the teacher has to make sure that she or he has all the questions ready for the students to brainstorm on the particular idea that needs to be taken care in that class. The questions help the students to be prompted to think in specific directions that will lead them to the first step of brainstorming. Also ask the students the reason of their answers. By this the teacher makes them aware of their associations to the answers. The questions like &quot;what made you think like that?&quot; shall guide them well.
In the &#x27;W&#x27; column, ask associating questions or liking questions to make them come to the thinking. questions like, &quot;what would you like to learn more about this idea?&quot; can help them to analyze and think more. The teacher here has to come prepared with her/his own set of questions that will link the students&#x27; questions to the idea in the text. This is done so that the student shall not lose the flow of the text as well as not lose the purpose of the activity.
In the last column &#x27;L&#x27;, help the students to come out with their own creative ideas and analysis. Also in this particular column, the teacher shall ask the students to differentiate between the answers to their questions and ideas in other columns and the idea they found interesting. At last, the teacher shall help the students to consult other sources which would answer their questions which are not mentioned in the text.

A KWL chart can be used to drive instruction in the classroom. The teacher can create lesson plans based upon the interests and inquiries of the students and their needs. Using this strategy can increase motivation and attention by activating the students&#x27; prior knowledge. This allows the teacher to understand the students&#x27; prior knowledge and the students&#x27; interests in the topic.

==Purpose==
A teacher has many reasons for using KWL charts in the classroom. First, a KWL chart activates students&#x27; prior knowledge of the text or topic to be studied. By asking students what they already know, students are thinking about prior experiences or knowledge about the topic. Next, KWL charts set a purpose for the unit. Students can add their input to the topic by asking them what they want to know. Students then have a purpose for participating and engaging in the topic. Also, using a KWL chart allows students to expand their ideas beyond the text used in the classroom. By being aware of students&#x27; interests, the teacher has the ability to create projects and assignments that the students will enjoy. A KWL chart is a tool that can be used to drive instruction as well as guide student learning. 
KWL charts are used by elementary teachers from literature to science. They are also used to teach historical content at the elementary level.

=== Study tool ===
A KWL chart can be used as a study tool for an individual, group, or entire class. It is a way to synthesize information into a visual aid. The students are also able to keep track of what they have done and what they still would like, or need to do.

=== Required materials ===
Materials required can vary on the type of classroom activity the teacher intends to carry. For a classroom activity if the teacher divides the class for a particular topic then one paper with a KWL chart per group shall be given. But if the teacher wants every child to brainstorm on the given topic, they shall have their own student paper copy.

=== Specific learners ===
KWL charts can be used with all students, however, there are specific groups of students that lend themselves quite well to this strategy, including visual learners, young learners, or ESL learners. As the chart is a graphic organizer it can aid visual learners. The information is presented in a user-friendly way that is visually accessible. Due to the visual nature of the KWL chart it can also be beneficial for young learners such as preschoolers. Words may not be necessary, and pictures can be used to express the chart&#x27;s ideas. As pictures can be used alone or in conjunction with words, the KWL chart may assist students learning a second language.
== Adaptations ==
There are various adaptations of KWL charts that can be used within the classroom.

=== Hill ===
One adaptation as created by Hill is an extension of the traditional KWL chart to include a column for &quot;Further Wonderings&quot; at the end of the table. This allows for the students&#x27; knowledge to continue beyond what they have learned within the classroom. The idea behind this extra column is to encourage the students to continue to learn.

=== KLEW ===
Another adaptation of the KWL chart is the KLEW chart. The KLEW chart was developed by a group of people with various backgrounds including an elementary school teacher, a professor and a professional development specialist. Within this chart, the &quot;K&quot; stands for what students know of a topic, the &quot;L&quot; for what is being learned, the &quot;E&quot; for evidence that supports the learning previously described, and the &quot;W&quot; for wondering, which leaves room for further questions. This table differs from the traditional KWL chart as it places an emphasis on observation and examination of evidence that supports what they see.

=== Mooney ===
Margaret Mooney suggested a variation to the KWL chart by adding a fifth column to the traditional chart. This column would be located between the &quot;W&quot; and the &quot;L&quot;. Its purpose is to answer the question &quot;How&quot;. This encourages the students to develop their own means of how they will discover more information. This can be quite useful in the sciences for experimentation purposes.

== Assessment and evaluation ==
The KWL chart is useful to complete formative assessment in the classroom. It allows the teacher to find out the students prior knowledge on a particular topic. From this knowledge the teacher is then able to gear their lessons based upon this information. The KWL chart can be completed when starting a new topic and be added to throughout the unit. Further, the teacher is able to find out what the students have learned by the end of their lessons.

KWL charts work well in order to examine the individual student or the entire class in order to understand their thinking and learning.

=== Advantages ===
According to Jared and Jared (1997), KWL was established with the motive to enhance the comprehensive reading skills of the students. This was done by designing the three levels of the activity focusing on the different learning styles of the individuals.
According to Glazer(1998), students fail to enjoy the text or content because they fail to understand it. Hence, KWL increases their comprehension skills as the activity goes through each topic step by step. 
According to Szabo(2006), a KWL table uses a strategy of before-during-after for the students to enhance their comprehension skills. The students start by brainstorming the prior knowledge about the topic and then eventually develop curiosity about the topic. This builds their interest in the topic and they would want to learn more about the topic. KWL chart gives an opportunity to the individual to build up self-motivation regarding the topic. Through KWL table, the students go through self-evaluation as they know what they intend to learn and what they really understood. Hence, KWL gives the students some space to explore the topic through other sources and build up their knowledge.

<doc id="1289808" wikidata="Q2515990" url="?curid=1289808" title="Jacques Duphly">
<text>Jacques Duphly (also Dufly, Du Phly; 12 January 1715 – 15 July 1789) was a French harpsichordist and composer.

==Early career as an organist==
He was born in Rouen, France, the son of Jacques-Agathe Duphly and Marie-Louise Boivin. As a boy, he studied the harpsichord and organ, and was employed as organist at the cathedral in Évreux. He obtained his first position at the cathedral of St. Eloi at the age of nineteen. In 1740 he added a second position at the church of Notre Dame de la Ronde, which he maintained with the help of his sister Marie-Anne-Agathe, who substituted for him. His teachers were François d&#x27;Agincourt and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Later, Rousseau would ask him to contribute to his dictionary, for articles relating to the art of playing the harpsichord.

==Career as harpsichordist==
In 1742, after the death of his father, Duphly decided to move to Paris, where he abandoned playing the organ altogether and devoted himself to the harpsichord. He became famous as a performer and teacher. According to Louis-Claude Daquin: &quot;For some time he was organist at Rouen, but doubtless finding that he had a greater gift for the harpsichord, he abandoned his first instrument. One may suppose that he did well, for he passes in Paris for a very good harpsichordist. He has much lightness of touch and a certain softness, which, sustained by ornaments, marvelously render the character of his pieces.&quot; According to Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg he devoted himself to the harpsichord in order &quot;not to spoil his hand with the organ&quot;.

He published four volumes of harpsichord music in 1744, 1748, 1756 and 1768. The last book contained &quot;La Pothouin&quot;. He was considered by Pascal Taskin, the harpsichord maker, to be one of the best teachers in Paris.

==Later life==

Some time after publishing his fourth volume of works, Duphly effectively disappeared from public life, for reasons which are not known. In 1788, an advertisement in the Journal Général de la France asked: &quot;We want to know what happened to M. du Phly, previously harpsichord master in Paris, where he was in 1767. If he does not exist any more, we would like to meet his heirs, to whom we have a communication to make.&quot;

He died on 15 July 1789, the day after the storming of the Bastille, in an apartment in the Hôtel de Juigné, without a harpsichord. Duphly left his possessions to his servant, who was with him for 30 years.

Only fifty-two works by Duphly are known, most of which were published during his lifetime in the four volumes of harpsichord music mentioned above. The titles of the work refer to well-known protectors of art (e.g. &quot;La Victoire&quot;, &quot;la de Sartine&quot;) or other composers (e.g. &quot;La Forqueray&quot;). His late music contains elements typical of the early classical movement - e.g. the use of Alberti bass, quite dissimilar to Jean-Philippe Rameau or François Couperin.

<text>Kanchanadit (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) in Surat Thani province, south Thailand.

==History==
Originally, the town was named &quot;Tha Thong&quot; (ท่าทอง) after the river of the same name (&quot;Tha Thong Mai&quot;, (named &quot;Khlong Tha Phet&quot; at the time). During the reign of King Nangklao (Rama III), the town was moved because it was malaria-infested and renamed &quot;Kanchanadit&quot;. It was a provincial town (&quot;mueang&quot;) under the control of the Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom. After King Mongkut took power, it was put under the supervision of Bangkok directly. In 1899, the province was merged with Chaiya and reduced to &quot;amphoe&quot; (district) status.

==Geography==
The district is in the eastern part of the province. It stretches from the coast to Bandon Bay of the Gulf of Thailand in the north, the low river valley of the Tapi River to the west, and the Nakhon Si Thammarat mountain range in the south and west. Tai Rom Yen National Park was created on 31 December 1991, protecting the forested hills of that mountain range. The main river in the district is the Tha Thong River, which empties into the Tapi estuary.

Neighbouring districts are (from the east clockwise): Don Sak, Sichon, Nopphitam of Nakhon Si Thammarat, Ban Na San and Mueang Surat Thani.

The main road through the district is Thailand Route 401, which connects Kanchanadit with the town of Surat Thani. Thailand Route 44 begins at Route 401 and runs to the southwest as part of a land bridge across the Malay Peninsula.

==Administration==
===Central===

Kanchanadit district is divided into 13 sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 117 administrative villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

===Local===
There are five sub-district municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambons&quot;) in the district:
* Kanchanadit (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Kadae.
* Tha Thong Mai (Thai: ) consisting of parts of sub-district Tha Thong Mai.
* Chang Sai (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Chang Sai.
* Krut (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Krut.
* Chang Khwa (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Chang Khwa.

There are nine sub-district administrative organizations (SAO) in the district:
* Tha Thong Mai (Thai: ) consisting of parts of sub-district Tha Thong Mai.
* Tha Thong (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Tha Thong.
* Thung Kong (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Thung Kong.
* Phlai Wat (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Phlai Wat.
* Pa Ron (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Pa Ron.
* Takhian Thong (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Takhian Thong.
* Tha U-thae (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Tha U-thae.
* Thung Rang (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Thung Rang.
* Khlong Sa (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Khlong Sa.

<doc id="1289860" wikidata="Q7714055" url="?curid=1289860" title="The Apprentice (American TV series) season 3">
<text>The Apprentice 3 is the third season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. It premiered January 20, 2005 on NBC. This was the last season to land in the Top 20 Nielsen ratings, ranking at #15, with an average of 13.96 million viewers. This was the only season nominated for an Emmy Award.

==Season changes==

In this season, two groups of nine were divided into &quot;book smarts&quot; (who took the name &quot;Magna Corp&quot;) and &quot;street smarts&quot; (called &quot;Net Worth&quot;) referring to those with and without a completed college education. This replaced the &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; concept used on &quot;The Apprentice 1&quot; and &quot;The Apprentice 2&quot;.

Trump continued the twist introduced in the previous season that allowed the winning project manager to be exempt from firing should their team lose the next task. However, he discontinued the Season 2 option that allowed the losing project manager to bring three people into the boardroom as opposed to two, after it was only used twice during the season. Trump did make one exception to this rule and allowed Audrey to bring three people into the Boardroom when she lost a challenge, but she ended up being fired anyway.

==Candidates==

The Net Worth team contained four men and five women, and the Magna Corp team contained five men and four women. Trump stated that &quot;You just have to be business-smart&quot;, no matter what kind of smarts you have. See the candidates page for specific details on the candidates. Trump also pointed out one other major difference between the two groups – those with only a high school diploma earn three times as much as the college grads. Stephanie suggested Magna for the team name. It was short for &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, which means &quot;with great distinction&quot; and is often used as a title for high achieving graduates. Tara suggested Net Worth.


==Weekly results==
: The candidate was on the losing team.
: The candidate was hired and won the competition.
: The candidate won as project manager on his/her team.
: The candidate lost as project manager on his/her team.
: The candidate was brought to the final boardroom.

==Episodes==

===Week 1: Whopper 101===
*Airdate: January 20, 2005
*Hosting Company: Burger King
*Magna project manager: Todd
*Net Worth project manager: John
*Project: Both teams have to promote new hamburger product from Burger King and then sell it.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Trump Monologue: &quot;Perseverance&quot; – The best people are the ones that don&#x27;t stop until the sale is made, they never give up, they have &quot;no quit&quot;.
*Results: Magna chosen Triple Cheese Angus Steak Burger while Net Worth chosen Western Angus Burger.
*Winning team: Net Worth
**Reasons for Victory:The team of &quot;street smarts&quot; specifically picked a burger that they would be able to make an effective marketing campaign out of. They were able to incorporate a Western theme in their restaurant, along with a contest for two round-trip tickets to Las Vegas, that encouraged customers to buy their burger. Net Worth also had three cashiers and eight members trained for the restaurant, and were able to successfully upsell their burger. They sold 182 units of their specialty item for a total of $596.96.
**Reward: Dinner with Trump at the famed Club 21 restaurant.
*Losing team: Magna
**Reasons for loss: Magna had trained six people and only had two cashiers in their restaurant, which led to a bad point of sale and long lines. They also had an awful promotion scheme. They sold 139 units for a total of $553.22. Not only did they sell fewer units of their specialty burger, they ended up losing by $43.74.
*Sent to boardroom: Todd, Alex, Danny
**Firing Verdict: Danny was singled out by nearly the entire team for handling their marketing strategies. Kendra was the only one to blame Todd for his inability to control Danny, which impressed Carolyn. Alex pointed out that he was responsible for only training two cashiers at the restaurant, which bothered Trump and his advisors.
*Fired: Todd Everett – for no leadership ability, being unable to control his team, performing poorly throughout the task including sitting away from the team the day before the selling event, and for making poor delegations. While Alex doomed the team by training only two cashiers and Danny was considered a loose cannon, Trump felt they were capable of being led and that Todd&#x27;s lack of leadership was the primary reason they failed.
*Notes:
** Trump was unimpressed that the college graduates were beaten by the high school graduates. He asked Magna if he wasted his time getting a college degree – Todd quickly assured him this was not the case.
** This is the first time in Apprentice history where the losing project manager is the first to be fired.

===Week 2: Motel 666===
*Airdate: January 27, 2005
*Hosting Company: Yahoo!
*Magna project manager: Michael
*Net Worth project manager: Brian
*Project: Each team has a budget of $20,000 to renovate a motel on the Jersey Shore, then the teams must welcome the paying guests, who will rate the motel and the customer service they receive through Yahoo! Local site. The winner will be determined by highest rating.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Trump Monologue: &quot;Respect Comes From Winning&quot; – Trump gives the example of Vince Lombardi and explains that the only reason he got away with the things he did was because he won (over the monologue Trump is shown playing golf with Annika Sörenstam).
*Winning team: Magna
**Magna&#x27;s score rating: 3.96
**Reasons for victory: Magna&#x27;s scores for the motel&#x27;s rooms and facilities were only slightly better than Net Worth&#x27;s, but Danny decided to throw a pool party, which created a good atmosphere among the guests and a fantastic customer service rating. Their plans for breakfast were nearly scuppered when Verna (who was supposed to be in charge of looking after the guests) abruptly left the motel, claiming that she was too stressed to continue in the process, but Carolyn chased after her and persuaded her to return, while Bren helped to salvage the breakfast situation.
**Reward: An evening of dinner, drinks, and cigars with businessman Steve Forbes aboard his yacht.
*Losing team: Net Worth
**Net Worth&#x27;s score rating: 2.92
**Reasons for loss: Brian&#x27;s decision to spend almost the entire budget on renovating the bathrooms and building full-length wardrobes did not improve the ratings by as much as he had hoped, and the dirty rooms with bad carpeting decimated their overall rating. Even more damaging was the argument between Brian and Kristen right in front of the motel and their guests; while Angie and Audrey attempted to diffuse it, Kristen refused to calm down and started yapping at the women as well.
**Sent to Boardroom: No final boardroom – Brian immediately admitted that the defeat was wholly his fault, and said that he should be fired.
**Firing verdict:
***Trump questioned other team members of Net Worth in order to determine whether Brian alone was at fault for the loss, and while several of them said that Kristen&#x27;s attitude had exacerbated the problems, all agreed that Brian&#x27;s decisions had doomed them from the start.
***Brian nonetheless argued the points against Kristen, and also Chris&#x27;s lack of contribution to the task despite his background in home renovation, until Trump reminded Brian that he had said he should be fired, implicitly asking whether he wanted to retract that statement and hold a final boardroom with Chris and Kristen.
***Brian said that he was a fighter, but refused to withdraw his statement that he should be fired; after a confused Carolyn pointed out the contradiction in his words, Trump declared any further discussion a waste of time, before picking up the thread and telling Brian to &quot;get lost&quot;.
**Fired: Brian McDowell – for wasting money on many replacement toilets, the fact that no one liked him as a team leader, not having a set budget, being an incompetent and abrasive leader, and for saying that Trump should fire him. After Brian requested his termination, Trump said at that point that Brian was finished.
*Notes:
**At the start of the boardroom, Trump told John that he was exempt from being fired, and then jokingly asked him if he&#x27;d like to waive his exemption, referencing former candidate Bradford Cohen&#x27;s actions in the second episode of the previous season. John held onto the exemption however, noting that even if he didn&#x27;t get himself instantly fired by doing that, he had argued with Brian several times during the task (though unlike Kristen, John stopped doing so after the guests arrived) and would have been one of his main targets were he not exempt.
**While questioning other members of Net Worth, Angie told Chris that she was disappointed in how much he contributed to the task due to him previously boasting to the team about his experience in renovation, this caused Chris to lose his temper and yell at Angie that he did not have hands-on experience in renovation, which Angie did not find satisfactory and when questioned further by Trump, Angie said that Chris should be fired over Brian because she believed Brian had more leadership potential. This marks the first of several times that Chris loses his temper in the boardroom.
**At one point during the boardroom session, Carolyn suggested to Brian to stop using expletives after Brian&#x27;s repeated uses of the &quot;F&quot; word; Brian apologized, but added that he had simply been quoting what Kristen said to him during the task.
*Episode Recap on NBC.com

===Week 3: Trouble is Brewing===
*Airdate: February 3, 2005
*Quit: Verna Felton – From the second episode, it was noticeable that Verna had lost her motivation to continue on the show. Danny wanted the team to let her take the next task off so she could feel better, but no one on Magna supported this idea. After a meeting with her team, Verna simply opted to resign for unspecified personal reasons. This was the first time someone left &quot;The Apprentice&quot; on their own terms without being fired (Brian had effectively quit in the previous week by saying that he deserved to be fired, but Trump still fired him in the usual manner).
*Hosting Company: Nestlé
*Magna Project Manager: Danny
*Net Worth project manager: Angie
*Trump Monologue: &quot;Lead With Authority&quot; – A leader rarely leads with consensus; a leader has to be capable of thinking independently and often go against consensus.
*Project: Both teams were asked to promote Nestlé Nescafe brand. The winner will chosen and judged by Nescafe executives.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Winning team: Net Worth
**Reasons for victory: The team decided to build their campaign around a political debate theme (tying into the presidential election that was ongoing at the time of filming) based on the merits of hot and cold coffee, creating a lot of buzz and getting across an impression of the Nestlé that its executives wanted.
**Reward: A ride on a helicopter with a view of New York City from above.
*Losing team: Magna
**Reasons for loss: While Magna&#x27;s campaign was generally well-run, their promotional event failed to give any message about the product. Moreover, Magna spent vastly more than Net Worth, practically using up their entire budget and yet achieved inferior results to their competitors. Danny&#x27;s insistence on having the entire team vote on every single major decision had severely slowed the team down in the planning stages, while Michael contributed virtually nothing to the task and was very disrespectful to Danny, causing the other Magna members to accuse him of hiding behind his immunity.
**Initial Boardroom: Erin strongly made the case for Michael to lose his exemption, arguing that he had deliberately misused it to avoid doing any work on the task, and calling his character into question. Bren, meanwhile, stated that while Michael had been the team&#x27;s weakest performer, Danny was the one most to blame for the loss.
**Sent to boardroom: Danny, Michael, and Stephanie. Danny asked whether he could bring back Michael despite his exemption, to which Trump replied that while he personally didn&#x27;t recommend it, he would allow it.
**Firing verdict: Trump quickly deemed Stephanie to be safe, as the event planner she recommended had done a good job despite the arguably excessive amount the team had spent. Despite Trump heavily criticizing Michael&#x27;s performance, he acknowledged that he was not directly at fault for the loss, and had not committed any rule breach serious enough to deserve having his exemption revoked. This therefore left Danny to be fired by default as the losing project manager.
*Fired: Danny Kastner – for lackluster leadership, being too polite and conciliatory while in charge, having the entire team agree on a decision and inability to make decisions as a leader, bringing Michael to the Final Boardroom, who was exempt from termination, back to the boardroom in an unsuccessful attempt to get him fired anyway, and allowing himself to be manipulated into doing so by Erin. While Trump did say that he would have revoked Michael&#x27;s immunity if he had committed a serious breach of the rules, he decided that laziness and incompetence was not enough of a reason for Michael to lose his immunity. Trump and his advisors felt that while Erin had clearly manipulated him into bringing Michael back, ultimately it would not have mattered who he chose to come back into the final boardroom, and that he was solely responsible for the team&#x27;s loss.
*Notes
** This episode features the first time in &quot;Apprentice&quot; history that a contestant quit for personal reasons, namely Verna. Verna is the only candidate this season not to have been project manager.
** Trump nonetheless said he was sorry to see Danny go, and still liked him on a personal level and also warned Michael (who was exempt from firing this week) to step up and to not let it happen again.
** In his exit interview Danny played his guitar and sang about his experience. He then signed out by saying &quot; Rock and Roll&quot;

===Week 4: Soap Dopes===
*Airdate: February 10, 2005
*Task sponsor: Dove and Deutsch Inc.
*Task scope: Teams are asked to create a 30-second advertising commercial for a new product from Dove: Cool Moisture Body Wash. The winner will be decided by Donny Deutsch and advertising executives from Dove.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Magna project manager: Erin
*Net Worth project manager: Kristen
*Trump Monologue &quot;Never Settle&quot; – People settle for mediocrity because they are lazy.
*Winning team: No winning team – upon viewing the finished commercials, Donny deemed them both to be so atrocious that he told Trump he couldn&#x27;t even consider naming either team as the winner. As a result, Trump declared that both Magna and Net Worth had lost the task, and that both teams would return to the boardroom.
*Losing team: Magna and Net Worth
**Reasons for loss of Magna: Bren came up with a ridiculous idea involving a woman trying to seduce a man by washing a cucumber with him (in a very sexually implicit way), only for the man to walk off with another man. The commercial came off as &quot;weird vegetable porn&quot; and included no other information about the soap, which was only featured on-screen for five seconds at the end.
**Sent to boardroom (Magna): Erin, Michael, and Bren
**Reasons for loss of Net Worth: While the soap of the product was featured much more in Net Worth&#x27;s commercial, Donny Deutsch disliked the fact that they had a runner applying the soap directly to his face and rubbing the soap off with a towel. While he was supposed to use water from a hydration point along with the soap, Kristen decided to just film him using the soap in order to save time. The Dove executives also felt that the product was used inappropriately, as it was intended as a full-body wash and not a facial soap.
**Sent to boardroom (Net Worth): Kristen, Tana, and Audrey.
**Firing Verdict:
***After returning to the final boardroom, Trump took the unusual step of telling Erin on Magna that she was in absolutely no danger of being fired, since she had led the team well, and that she would instead be fighting to save Bren (who came up with their awful idea) and Michael (who had contributed the least to the task).
***Erin&#x27;s defense with Magna&#x27;s team effort impressed Trump, which led to no one on Magna being eliminated.
***When it came to Net Worth, Kristen was told in no uncertainty that she was facing dismissal, especially when Audrey and Tana admitted that they would rather see Kristen fired than Bren or Michael, despite the two men being on the opposing team.
***Trump was confused why Audrey and Tana were picked for the boardroom, and he ultimately deemed Kristen as the most liable for the loss as she didn&#x27;t control her team and failed to follow through on the original concept.
***Kristen tried to defend herself by saying that her team was hard to manage, but this backfired when Trump stated his belief that the other team (Magna) was harder to manage.
*Fired: Kristen Kirchner – for bad leadership, not holding her team together, being difficult to work with, bringing back Tana and Audrey for no good reason, and most crucially making the fatal mistake of removing the washing if the soap during the commercial filming. Trump felt that while Magna had held together well and tried their hardest to execute a very poorly conceived idea, Kristen had a good idea in her hands but completely ruined its execution, which he deemed unforgivable.
*Notes
**Prior to the task briefing, Bren calmly but sternly laid into Michael for his actions in the previous task, claiming that he didn&#x27;t give a damn about the team and needed to step up, claiming &quot;the dad in me woke up when he chastised him.
**This episode features the first time in &quot;Apprentice&quot; history that there are no winning team or a reward due to both teams completely failing at the task. This happened again in The Apprentice (American season 8).
**In the boardroom, Chris made several homophobic remarks when discussing Magna&#x27;s advert. Trump asked Chris whether he was in fact gay himself, but Chris strongly denied that this was the case, which got an openly skeptical reaction from the other candidates. Erin meanwhile defended the homosexual overtones by pointing out the hit show Will &amp; Grace, a show notable for featuring gay characters prominently.
**Prior to the initial boardroom, Kristen got Tana to agree to back her up against Audrey in the final boardroom. In the initial boardroom however, Kristen accused Tana of being rude to the actors hired for the commercial, which quickly caused Tana to turn on Kristen and say that she was at fault for the loss and should be fired.
**The episode ended with a professionally produced ad for the week&#x27;s product.
**While Net Worth&#x27;s marathon runner commercial was a failure on &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, the same concept was used on a commercial in France for Mennen Sport.
**Trump was very irritated by the results of this week. He later admitted he was so unhappy that he was tempted to fire them all and bring in all new candidates.

===Week 5: Airstream of Consciousness===
*Airdate: February 17, 2005
*Sponsor: Visa USA and Airstream
*Magna project manager: Bren
*Net Worth project manager: Tana
*Project: Teams had to create their own mobile service business from Airstream. The team with the most profit wins.
*Judges: Donald Trump; George H. Ross; Jill Cremer
*Trump Monologue &quot;Instinct&quot; – Emphasizes the importance of trusting Instincts.
*Winning team: Net Worth
**Reasons for Victory: Net Worth earned a profit of $991. Net Worth did a mobile casting business which proved be a hit despite the risks, leading to result of having a stronger marketing plan.
**Reward for Winning: $20,000 shopping spree for pearls at Mikimoto.
*Losing team: Magna
**Reasons for loss: Although they had a good concept of mobile spa-massaging service and had a good location, Magna had weak marketing strategies. They had only earned $918.50, losing by almost $73. Michael, who was charge of Marketing didn&#x27;t contribute much of anything to the task, while Stephanie&#x27;s negative attitude and questioning of Bren&#x27;s decisions deflated Magna.
**Initial Boardroom: Trump grilled Magna over their awful track record of winning only 1 out of the 5 tasks and seeing that New Worth has been consistently beating them. When asked who should be fired most of team Magna agreed Bren had done well, and were divided on Stephanie, who had very questionable behavior and showed little respect for Bren, and Michael who was ineffective with the Marketing and didn&#x27;t make any large contribution.
**Sent to boardroom: Bren, Stephanie, and Michael
**Firing verdict: When Trump asked Bren who should be fired, he selected Stephanie, which led to a lengthy argument between the two. Michael interrupted the argument in an effort to back up Stephanie, but this only served to anger Trump, who asked Michael why he was bringing attention to himself during an argument between two people who were more directly at fault for the loss. Michael attempted to explain that he was just supporting what Stephanie was saying about Bren, but Trump decided he&#x27;d had enough of Michael and fired him.
**Fired: Michael Tarshi – for his poor contributions in the last three tasks, not doing the marketing correctly on this task, maintaining a negative attitude, and for making too many excuses, in addition to saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. While Trump felt Stephanie was mainly responsible for her team loss due to her lousy attitude, he decided that Michael&#x27;s poor performances and interjections in the boardroom gave him enough evidence to fire Michael and give Stephanie a second chance.
*Notes:
**In this task, Jill Cremer fills in for Carolyn. This is the first time Carolyn is absent.
**An additional factor in Michael&#x27;s firing was the fact that he twice claimed to be the same type of person as Trump; once during a camera interview, and then again in the boardroom. Trump took offense to this claim, telling Michael immediately before his firing: &quot;You claim to be like me? The difference is, I work hard! You&#x27;ve been lazy and nothing but trouble.&quot;
**Bren stated that he thought Michael actually had more to offer the team than Stephanie, noting that Michael had at least been a good Project Manager on the second task, whereas Stephanie hadn&#x27;t done much throughout the process.
**Michael left his business card on the boardroom table for Trump after he was fired, telling Trump to contact him the next time he&#x27;s in Boston, and that he owns a &quot;very large parking lot&quot; in town.
**This is the last time that Net Worth (and by extension, both Angie and Chris) won a task. Conversely, it was also the final time that Kendra was on the losing team.
**This is the first time this season where the project manager is not fired.

===Week 6: The Writing on the Wall===
*Airdate: February 24, 2005
*Sponsor: Sony Electronics and PlayStation
*Magna project manager: Alex
*Net Worth project manager: Tara
*Project: Create a graffiti tag in Harlem to promote the Sony PlayStation 2 game &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;. The winner will determined as judged by Sony PlayStation&#x27;s executives, who will base their decision on feedback from local residents.
*Judges: Donald Trump; George H. Ross; Jill Cremer
*Trump Monologue &quot;Shut Up And Listen&quot; Trump emphasizes the importance of listening, one doesn&#x27;t have to follow what others are saying but it is important to listen in order to learn.
*Winning team: Magna
**Reasons for victory: Magna&#x27;s advert was eye-catching and showcased the variety of scenery and vehicles featured in the game. It also made good use of the Sony and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; branding, clearly communicating their message to the locals. Magna also talked to locals about what they would like to see in a &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; ad, and directly used their feedback.
**Reward for Winning: Photo shoot for individual portraits with world-famous photographer Patrick Demarchelier.
*Losing team: Net Worth
**Reasons for loss: Tara decided to focus more on creating a piece of art rather than an ad, feeling that focusing too much on the advertising aspect would be disrespectful to the Harlem community. Unfortunately, this ended up making the graffiti unrelated to the brands, and didn&#x27;t tell the residents anything about the game itself, which gave them no reason to buy it. In addition, at least one member of the focus group felt that the graffiti represented a stereotypical view of Harlem.
**Sent to boardroom: Tara, Audrey, Craig
**Firing verdict:
***George identified Tara&#x27;s main error as being that she came up with their concept and decided to make it community-focused before even finding out what exactly they were supposed to be advertising, and only minimally altered it after being fully briefed. Tara was also noted to have tried to claim all the credit for the advert during her presentation to the Sony executives, which did not help her cause.
***Audrey pointed out that it was ridiculous to expect her or John to know anything about the fourth game when it hadn&#x27;t even been released yet, and re-iterated that Tara had decided on the specific concept without consulting anyone else on the team. Despite this, Tara initially intended to bring the two back into the final boardroom, but after Craig strongly criticized her leadership, she decided to bring him back rather than John. While Trump said that he would have still fired Tara had she brought back John instead of Craig, he and George were both unimpressed by her decision, feeling it to be excessively petty.
***Trump and his advisors questioned why Tara brought in Craig, and she justified this by saying he got into an argument with Audrey about being recently married, which left Trump unimpressed.
***Craig further hurt Tara&#x27;s chances by saying he would fire Tara over Audrey (who was also not responsible for the loss), saying he didn&#x27;t like her concept. Trump agreed and despite Tara&#x27;s strong defense, Trump couldn&#x27;t overlook her mistakes and had virtually no choice but to fire her.
**Fired: Tara Dowdell – for ignoring the executives&#x27; wishes and producing an inoffensive but useless final ad, misinterpreting the point that it was a marketing task, and for allowing her emotions to tie into her decision to bring Craig into the final boardroom. While Trump felt Tara had great potential and was stronger than Audrey, her major mistakes, failing to understand the task, and Craig&#x27;s testimony completely sealed her fate.
*Special notes:
**Jill Cremer once again fills in for Carolyn in this episode.
**John and Audrey, who were both fans of &quot;Gran Turismo 3&quot; attempted to help Tara make their concept more relevant to the game, but she ignored them and later claimed in the boardroom that their feedback was irrelevant since it applied to the third game and not the fourth.
**Even though Tara was fired Trump acknowledged she had great potential and was clearly a strong contender, but he and his advisors agreed she blew the task too badly to give her a second chance, even if Trump felt Audrey was a weaker candidate.

===Week 7: Project Putt-putt===
*Airdate: March 3, 2005
*Sponsor: Golfing segment of The Trump Organization
*Hosting Company: Chelsea Piers
*Magna project manager: Stephanie
*Net Worth project manager: Audrey
*Project: To build a miniature golf course and attract the most business of sales revenue.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Ashley Cooper
*Trump Monologue &quot;Play Golf&quot; Trump simply discusses his love for the sports and how it can help people come together.
*Winning team: Magna
*Reasons for win: They earned a total profit of $508. Kendra cut Net Worth off at the knees by doing exclusive promotion deals to place her flyers at many other kid-friendly establishments. Thanks to this Magna was able to get more kids playing mini golf than Net Worth.
**Reward for Winning: Play golf with Trump and Cristie Kerr.
*Losing team: Net Worth
**Reasons for loss: They lost by $204 with a total profit of $304. John was disrespectful to Audrey, who was ineffective and not assertive, and maintained a negative attitude throughout the task, which didn&#x27;t go unnoticed by guest observer Ashley Cooper. Chris also alienated kids with his tobacco chewing and was lambasted for that in his clown costume.
**Sent to boardroom: Audrey, Craig, John, and Angie. - Audrey is the only person in this season to bring three people back into the boardroom. In the previous season, Trump had given the project manager a choice of bringing back two or three people, but frequently got two as a response. In this episode, after Audrey&#x27;s selections, Trump said he &quot;usually wouldn&#x27;t do it&quot;, but allowed her to.
**Fired: Audrey Evans – for her lack of leadership, inability to control the team, losing the respect of the entire team, blaming everyone except Tana for the loss, for being unable to take responsibility in the decision-making, and for Bringing Angie to the final boardroom without any valid explanation. While it was strongly implied that Audrey brought back Angie so that she could advocate against John, Audrey never actually explained this prior to or during the boardroom as Trump angrily asked Audrey why she brought Angie back which led Angie to angrily change her mind state that Audrey deserved to be fired rather than John.
*Special notes:
**Ashley Cooper fills in for George Ross in this week&#x27;s episode.
**John was given a final warning by Trump, who while not considering him to be directly to blame for the loss, was bothered by his behavior towards Audrey, as well as the fact that this was the third time a losing project manager had singled him out for criticism, after Brian in Week 2 and Tara the previous week.

===Week 8: Bling it On===
*Airdate: March 10, 2005
*Hosting Company: FUSE TV, a cable-TV channel
*Magna project manager: Kendra
*Net Worth project manager: Chris
*Corporate Reshuffle: Before the project began, the project managers (Chris and Kendra) were assigned to send two people from their current team to the other side. Kendra sent Erin and Stephanie to Net Worth, while Chris shipped Tana and Craig over to Magna.
*Project: To run a charity auction where the bidders will get special attention/prizes from famous music stars.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Trump Monologue &quot;Go Big or Go Home&quot; Trump talks about aiming for the stars, swinging for the fences.
*Winning team: Magna.
**Reasons for Victory: While three of their five items sold for low prices, Craig and Tana were able to negotiate a pair of weeks on tour with Moby and Lil&#x27; Kim, and those two items single-handedly outgrossed Net Worth&#x27;s entire line-up. Magna raised $21,654.
**Reward for Winning: None, since this was a charity episode.
*Losing team: Net Worth
**Reasons for Loss: John took charge of the negotiations, but didn&#x27;t listen to what the musicians were telling him and negotiated a broadly similar set of prizes from all five of them (ex. playing a gig at someone&#x27;s house), meaning that none of their items stood out. Net Worth raised $11,325.
**Sent to Boardroom: Chris, John, and Erin
**Fired: John Gafford – for bad, repetitive negotiations by pitching the same thing to the celebrities and not listening to what the Musicians wanted, his insubordination in the past boardroom sessions by being singled out by past Project Managers (including Brian, Tara, and Audrey) for criticism, and for having totally fallen apart after being one of the frontrunners early in the season. Although that Carolyn felt that Chris could&#x27;ve managed his team better by delegating and also managing as well (Trump said he didn&#x27;t managed the team), Trump felt that John&#x27;s responsibility for the negotiations is what caused the team to lose.
*Notes:
** Gene Simmons and Lil Jon, who appeared in this episode, would return as contestants in &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Apprentice 4&quot; respectively, with Lil Jon subsequently returning for &quot;All-Star Celebrity Apprentice&quot;.
** This episode saw the first appearance of Donald Trump Jr. on the show, when he was seen watching the auction on television with his father. Donald Jr. would later become a boardroom judge in his own right.
** In the boardroom, Trump questioned whether Chris regretted his decision to remove Craig and Tana from the team, considering they were most responsible for Magna&#x27;s success. Chris stood by his decision however, and accused them of disrupting the team&#x27;s harmony in the prior tasks.
** John later claimed that Donald Trump expressed a wish to fire Stephanie (who had immunity from her week 7 win as project manager), but this has never been confirmed.
*Episode Recap on NBC.com

=== Mid-Season Highlights: What You Didn&#x27;t See... ===
*Airdate: March 17, 2005
*This episode featured unaired footage from the first eight weeks. Among other new details:
**The Net Worth team struggled while learning how to use Burger King&#x27;s computerized order system.
**Kendra found a great bargain on furniture, but Michael&#x27;s decision to have Bren and Danny pick it up instead of paying for delivery led them to bad-mouth him as they got lost on the winding roads of New Jersey.
**Brian gave a post-firing interview where he declared that he did a great job on his task and Donald Trump should hire him anyway.
**Michael and Stephanie both annoy their teammates with their poor attitudes during the Airstream task.
**After Stephanie and Erin are cast off of Magna by Kendra, Chris asks Donald Trump if he can send them back; as everyone but Stephanie and Erin laughs heartily, Trump says no, but also that he&#x27;ll remember the request.
**Tana asks Erin, who was cut from Magna to Net Worth along with Stephanie, if Erin and Stephanie will trade bedrooms so that each set of traded competitors (Tana and Craig are the other one) can be near their new teams. Erin was angered by the request and said no.

===Week 9: Pandora&#x27;s Box===
*Airdate: March 24, 2005
*Hosting Company: Home Depot
*Magna project manager: Craig
*Net Worth project manager: Angie
*Project: To create a short presentation/event for Home Depot.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Trump Monologue &quot;Sell Your Ideas&quot; Trump Discusses the importance of presenting proposals and proper communication, if a great idea is not proposed adequately it will fail.
*Winning team: Magna
**Reasons for victory: Craig decided the team should simply design a box. After Craig&#x27;s teammates felt his concept was mediocre with no imagination, the presentation ends up being a big draw for the children because they can finger paint, draw on boxes, and build it with their parents.
**Reward for Winning: Taking a ride in a Zero-G jet, simulating weightlessness in space.
*Losing team: Net Worth
**Reasons for loss: Net Worth decides to build a mobile kitchen island. They had a good concept, but their presentation fell apart and it flops as Chris puts the top on upside down, and their originality short-timing presentation goes off being more than 20 minutes long. The crucial factor, in the eyes of the expert assessors, was that it is vital for a clinic to have customer involvement while Net Worth did the assembly themselves.
**Sent to Boardroom: Chris, Angie, and Erin
**Initial task: During the task of Net Worth, Erin said that she doesn&#x27;t know about Home Depot. And Angie decided not having her as a presenter of the team&#x27;s presentation, since she felt Erin&#x27;s bad attitude.
**Firing Verdict: Trump says Erin should have been the presenter and considers firing Angie, even though George and Carolyn advised against it. When Trump acknowledged that he usually listens to his advisors, Erin coyly asked &quot;Do you have to?&quot;, and even winked at Trump. An offended Carolyn called it &quot;a dumb statement&quot;, and Trump calls her a &quot;wise guy&quot; and then he said, &quot;You know what Erin? You&#x27;re fired!&quot;.
**Fired: Erin Elmore – for not contributing anything and maintaining a bad attitude throughout this task, attempting to flirt with Trump in the boardroom and being openly disrespectful to Carolyn and George.

===Week 10: The Pie&#x27;s the Limit===
*Airdate: March 31, 2005
*Hosting Company: Domino&#x27;s Pizza
*Magna project manager: Bren
*Net Worth project manager: Stephanie
*Corporate Shuffle: Alex is shifted from Magna to Net Worth in this episode since they are down two members.
*Project: To create a new pizza for Domino&#x27;s Pizza, and sell it from a mobile street trailer.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Trump Monologue: &quot;Know When to Fold&quot; - Trump abstractly explains to give up on ideas that might be great on the drawing board, but don&#x27;t work better in practice. They should be shuttered so that you can start focuses on the next prospect. &quot;Note: The monologue was irrelevant to the task or the groups performance.&quot;
*Winning team: Magna with a total profit of $653.12
**Reasons for Victory: Tana brings out her Italian cooking knowledge and builds a nice design. While Kendra &amp; Tana used their negotiation strategies to target the team&#x27;s marketing. Magna did well because they decided to sell to the city banks who would give them big orders. They also managed to please the customers despite struggling to make pizzas quickly.
**Reward for Winning: Having breakfast with Trump in his gold-plated palace apartment.
*Losing team: Net Worth with a total profit of $523.90
**Reasons for Loss: Chris and Alex sell a bunch of advanced-order pizzas to a construction site near where the task starts. Unfortunately the actual selling site the next day winds up being across town. There are so many pizzas that it takes two people to carry them on the subway. Stephanie decides to go do this personally and apologizes to the workers because she feels it is a failure of honor to have the pizzas get there late. While Stephanie is gone from the pizza making site, Chris gets in a fight with Alex, Alex asserts himself, Chris makes aggressive statements. Later on during discussion Stephanie uses the word &quot;threat&quot;, which Alex then agrees is what happened. Stephanie tries to use all this in the boardroom to get Chris fired, but doesn&#x27;t process that Alex explicitly says he won&#x27;t only be targeting Chris in the Boardroom. The marketing street workers that Net Worth hires mill around and do not hit the hot spots, focusing their energies on the NYU campus which has people around at lunch but is not as busy as the business areas that Magna succeeds with.
**Sent to boardroom: Alex, Stephanie, and Chris
***Firing Verdict:
****Carolyn made it clear that she wanted Chris to go because she was concerned about his volatility.
****However, while Trump was upset at Chris&#x27; performance, he was more concerned about Stephanie&#x27;s poor leadership skills and her inability to handle difficult people.
****This caused Trump to fire Stephanie instead of Chris as the ability to overlook subordinates is an important task for a project manager.
****Additionally, Alex said he would prefer to work with Chris instead of Stephanie, saying she was bad at every task and her performances were only good by comparison.
**Fired: Stephanie Myers – for weak leadership, the bad decision with the construction site delivery (which Trump disliked), her inability to control her team, inability to deal with difficult people in a professional environment, and lingering disdain stemming from her efforts earlier in the season. Trump felt that Stephanie isn&#x27;t strong to handle people that are insubordinate.
*Notes:
**Both teams use &#x27;meatballs&#x27; as Pizza toppings since Trump said he likes meatballs.
**Stephanie, a vegetarian, forces herself to eat the meatball pizzas and says that she likes it to her team.
**Carolyn was visibly unhappy with the decision to keep Chris, but agreed that Stephanie was a poor leader. Trump warned Chris to &quot;get on the ball&quot; warning he will not last too long and he has been a poor performer each week.

===Week 11: Seams Stress===
*Airdate: April 7, 2005
*Sponsor: American Eagle
*Magna project manager: Tana
*Net Worth project manager: Alex
*Project: To design some kind of &#x27;high tech&#x27; modifications to clothing for American Eagle Outfitters company. Each team will have Visa Cards of $5,000 budget.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Michelle Scarborough
*Trump Monologue &quot;Let Nothing Get In Your Way&quot; Trump just says you should never give up.
*Winning team: Magna
**Reasons for victory: Magna does more research than Net Worth, figuring out that the gadget the market most wants is the cell phone even though when Bren and Craig brought back clothing that has been manhandled by the silkscreen shop, with paint blobs and a backwards logo on one of the items.
**Reward for Winning: Shopping at Bergdorf Goodman
*Losing team: Net Worth
**Reasons for loss: Net Worth didn&#x27;t bring a lot of details on their high tech gadgets in front of the executives. During some of the task, Angie felt Alex assigned her too many tasks and felt she was taking too much responsibility, pointing on the checklist which gave her about 19 things to do. They also had to make a last minute change in the order when one of the models forgot his item back at the designing store, and a flustered Angie stumbled in the presentation because of this.
**Sent to Boardroom: Chris, Alex, and Angie - Trump requested &quot;all of Net Worth&quot; to wait in the reception area.
**Firing Verdict:
***Carolyn criticizes Chris for making tremendous excuses, while Michelle criticizes Angie for a mediocre presentation.
***Trump says that Chris and Angie have both been in the boardroom six-consecutive appearances.
***Trump goes on to attack Angie, while saying that Alex had done well but was brought down by the two &quot;losers&quot;.
***Trump asks Angie if she &quot;choked&quot;, to which after much hassling from Trump, she felt that she could have done better but admits that she did, and then she&#x27;s fired. Carolyn was visibly displeased by this, but Trump says that he doesn&#x27;t like &quot;chokers&quot; and that he doesn&#x27;t want them in his organization.
**Fired: Angie McKnight – for stumbling during the presentation, for not being able to handle the pressure, for trying to blame her mistakes in the task on Alex and avoid taking responsibility for them which displeased Trump, and for her six-week losing streak.
*Special notes:
**Michelle Scarbrough, a Trump Organization staff attorney, filled in for George on this task.
**In her exit interview, Angie says she wants everyone to know that she didn&#x27;t &quot;choke&quot;.

===Week 12: A Lonely Drive===
* Airdate: April 14, 2005
* Sponsor: Pontiac and General Motors
* Magna project manager: Kendra
* Net Worth project manager: Chris
* Corporate Shuffle: Net Worth chooses Bren to come over from Magna due to a two-person deficit.
* Project: To create and promote a sales advertorial for the Pontiac Solstice car.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
** Dramatic Tension: On Magna, Tana and Craig go to sleep before it is done (a decision that ended up haunting Tana later on, as she openly stated she was not going to pull an all-nighter because she couldn&#x27;t be fired anyway), appearing to leave Kendra to finish it all (the Finale qualified this, as it revealed that Craig did return to the task to help Kendra finish it, while Tana slumbered uninterrupted). In the presentation to Pontiac, Tana tries to unjustifiably take over speaking duties from Kendra but Kendra fends her off and the team ends up netting a good result. On Net Worth, Alex took a nap early in the morning between 5:15am and 6:30am and during their presentation to Pontiac, Chris gets nervous and stumbles over his lines, making up new words like &#x27;interiorally and exteriorally&#x27;.
* Winning team: Magna
** Reasons for Victory: They delivered the emotion of the Pontiac Solstice in a creative way. Magna comes up with a round advertorial that looks very interesting and unique and has spaces for a CD and business cards. Its theme is the emotions that the car engenders. Pontiac is so impressed that they decide to use the editorials in their stores.
** Reward for winning: A basketball shoot-around at Madison Square Garden with Isiah Thomas and the New York Knicks&#x27; Penny Hardaway and Jamal Crawford.
* Losing team: Net Worth
** Reasons for loss: Their goal in delivering an emotional, persuasive message did not come through. Net Worth&#x27;s editorial has boring writing and looks generic. The lead photograph of the car is blurred with the intention of conveying speed.
** Initial Boardroom: George rages on their &#x27;fuzzy picture&#x27;. Alex says Bren&#x27;s writing is boring. Bren defends his writing by saying Alex should have told him the problem sooner. Alex told Trump he took a nap early in the morning and Trump questioned why he would take a nap when he was fighting for his life.
** Sent to boardroom: No final boardroom - Trump starts grilling Chris about why he has been in the boardroom losing so much. Chris does not flip out but admits that they lost. Donald asks George and Carolyn whom they would fire and they both say Chris. This, and a seven-week losing streak, seals Chris&#x27;s fate. He starts to cry in the boardroom after he is fired (an &quot;Apprentice&quot; first). Trump calls him back to shake his hand and tell him he is a good kid and to stop chewing tobacco and watch his temper.
** Fired: Chris Shelton – for producing a terrible, generic-looking brochure, his horrendous track record including his seven-week losing streak, being on 3 wins and 9 losses, and two failures as Project Manager/Team Leader, as well as his lack of ability to control his emotions and partially because of his addiction to tobacco (despite working hard to stop throughout the season). Although Bren&#x27;s writing was boring and Alex didn&#x27;t too much on the task, Trump felt it was obvious for Chris to go since he has been consistently losing each week. This was the seventh consecutive week that Chris was on the losing team, breaking the previous record of six weeks, that was held jointly by Kwame Jackson and Troy McClain of season one, and Angie in this season.
* Special notes:
** Craig and Tana left Kendra alone to work on the Solstice advertisement, with Tana citing her Immunity. George Ross would jump on this point during the final episode when Kendra and Tana were the Final 2.
** This is the first time (outside of finales) that Trump is shown shaking the hand of a contestant in the boardroom after firing him.
** With Chris&#x27;s firing, Net Worth no longer had any of its post-reshuffle members on the team.
** After announcing Magna&#x27;s reward for winning the task, Trump told Net Worth that the only slam dunk they were going to see was going to be in the boardroom when Trump fired one of them.

===Week 13: I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Clutter===
*Airdate: April 21, 2005
*Hosting Company: Staples
*Magna project manager: Craig
*Net Worth project manager: Alex
*Project: To design an office organizer for Staples and successfully present it to a focus group of Staples executives and managers.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Winning team: Magna
**Reasons for Win: Magna (Craig, Kendra, and Tana) creates a space-saving, efficient desk organizer (See &#x27;Special notes&#x27; below) in spite of continued conflict between Craig and Kendra. They held face-to-face meetings with the Staples executives and a group of managers as a focus group. The product clearly connected with the customers, who thought it was innovative, practical, and they would buy it.
**Reward for Winning: Breakfast at the Rainbow Room with George and Carolyn
*Losing team: Net Worth
**Reason for Loss: Net Worth created an invention that wasted space and was awkwardly arranged. They did not hit the mark, and once the top cover was flipped over, there was no place to go and no slide-in features, and the product was too big. This paled in comparison to Magna&#x27;s space-friendly and efficient invention, while Net Worth essentially had a second mobile desk. Alex had also decided to dispense with face-to-face meetings in order to save time, which led to Bren being unable to set up a focus group conference call.
**Initial Boardroom: George is embarrassed at both Alex and Bren for poor invention skills, although Alex and Bren thought they had a better-looking product. The focus of this boardroom was that Alex and Bren&#x27;s invention took up too much space, plus all the papers and supplies had to be placed in an awkwardly inconvenient matter. Carolyn pointed out the design/invention flaws during the boardroom. Donald, George, and Carolyn apparently were not happy with the difficulty of use arising from this &quot;Packrat&quot; invention idea Alex and Bren had.
**Sent to boardroom: No final boardroom - Alex showed his killer instinct in the boardroom while Bren let slip that he does not like to take risks at all. Among the risky ventures Alex cited to Trump were training as a competitive skier, going to a graduate school program in Israel, and working as a government lobbyist. This caught the attention of Trump; Bren was therefore fired for his inability to take risks and for his poor entrepreneurship.
**Fired: Bren Olswanger – for his unwillingness to take risks and Trump&#x27;s recognition that he was simply not as business-tested as the other candidates. Trump told Bren that he felt like he was teaching Bren coming out of kindergarten.
*Special notes:
**Trump stated that regardless of the outcome of this task, because the interview is entering its final stages, no further exemptions would be issued.
**Alex did not specify whether his education in Israel was a risk because of how it might impact his professional prospects or if it was based on the tumult in the country during the time he was there.
**You can now purchase Magna&#x27;s invention (officially dubbed and released as &quot;The Desk Apprentice&quot;) at Staples stores everywhere or through Staples Online for about US$29.99.

===Week 14: Bedazzled by a Beefy T===
*Airdate: April 28, 2005
*Hosting Company: Hanes
*Magna project manager: Kendra
*Net Worth project manager: Tana
*Project: To work with pop artists to design a T-shirt for Hanes celebrating their 50th anniversary, and make the most money selling the shirt.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Dramatic Tension: On Magna, Craig and Kendra continued to clash with each other throughout the task, Kendra wanted Craig to get her OK to make decisions, but Craig continuously argued against Kendra&#x27;s ideas feeling that selling the shirts as art rather than just a simple textile milled item, because of Kendra&#x27;s indecisiveness, changed the price points on some of their shirts to an incentivized volumed level, only to get annoyed with Kendra for telling him to keep them at the cost they&#x27;d agreed on. On Net Worth, Tana wasted several hours traveling to and from Staten Island to buy beads and accessories to attach to their T-shirts since she wanted to use the bedazzler on their clothes. This bothered Alex since he told her it&#x27;s a long drive from Manhattan.
*Winning team: Magna
**Reasons for Win: The team ultimately won out by exploiting their artist&#x27;s existing fanbase and contacts list, selling over half of their stock.
**Reward: Engaging in a Dogfight in two fighter planes. Kendra&#x27;s plane won out over Craig&#x27;s. Kendra revealed that her father had been a &quot;Top Gun&quot; pilot.
*Losing team: Net Worth
**Reasons for Loss: Though Tana did succeed in upselling the customised T-shirts, Alex failed to effectively market them and they sold them in quantities far too small to give them any real chance of victory, shifting barely a fifth of their stock.
**Sent to Boardroom: Alex and Tana—Net Worth was under internal review as Trump requested both of them to wait at the reception area.
**Firing Verdict:
***Trump considered firing Tana but she defended herself of her career capabilities that she can work for Trump. And also, she defended herself with her better 2–1 PM record &amp; 9–5 team record than Alex&#x27;s.
***Tana was criticized for making some blatant decisions to go to Staten Island.
***Trump grilled Alex of how many times he won &amp; lost as Project Manager and Alex stated that he won once and lost once. Trump viewed Alex&#x27;s statement dishonest because he lost twice from being the PM three times. Trump mentioned that he lost from Task 11 (Wearable Technology) &amp; Task 13 (Staples). The last time he won as PM was the PlayStation task from the graffiti billboard, which was eight weeks ago. Trump fired Alex instead for wanting Tana to make loads of mistakes from this task and keeping track of her mistakes instead of contributing.
**Fired: Alex Thomason – for not contributing much to the task, his five-week losing streak, and also for saying he had only lost once as Project Manager—Donald Trump viewed Alex&#x27;s statement as dishonest because he has been a losing PM twice, although Alex claimed that he had forgotten about being project manager last week with Bren, as they had shared responsibilities on the task (but the fact that they were disorganized and lost that task badly didn&#x27;t help Alex&#x27;s case either). Although both Tana &amp; Alex failed to mention at marketing in their sales segment and are both responsible for the loss, Tana brought up with numerous ideas and did most of the sales while Alex just took a back seat and hope that Tana failed.
*Notes:
* An interesting note is that Magna always won when Michael was either PM or not on the team, and always lost when he was on the team as a &#x27;regular&#x27; member (not PM). Ironically, Michael stated in his exit interview that Magna would crumble without him on the team
*Episode Recap from NBC.com

===Week 15: The Interviews===
*Task scope: Have an interview with four high-profile business executives:
** Dave Brandon, Chairman &amp; CEO of Domino&#x27;s Pizza
**Darlene Daggett, President of U.S. Commerce, QVC
** Howard Lorber, President of Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate
** Greg Brenneman, Chairman &amp; CEO of Burger King
*Results: All four executives agreed that they would not hire Craig, given that his answers were not specific and did not have any substance. Two of the executives stated they would hire Tana, because she had exceptional entrepreneurial skills and felt that Tana was the perfect balance of a mother, housewife, and businesswoman. They also felt that Kendra was a questionable candidate, with one of the executives calling Kendra&#x27;s answers &quot;scripted&quot;. On the contrary, the other two executives felt that Kendra was the best candidate, believing that she had amazing potential (while also being very young and unproven) and questioned Tana&#x27;s ability to work in a metropolitan environment.
*Fired: Craig Williams – for being unanimously deemed the worst by executives and for not having what it takes to be &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.

===Week 16: The Games People Play &amp; Week 17: Into the Stretch===
*Airdates: May 5, 12 and 19, 2005
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Sponsors:
**Book Smarts: PlayStation, Best Buy, and Electronic Arts Sports Division
**Street Smarts: NYC 2012 Olympics Board/Committee with the City of New York
*Book Smarts Finalist: Kendra
*Street Smarts Finalist: Tana
*Project:
**Book Smarts: Best Buy Fight Night Promotion.
**Street Smarts: NYC 2012 Athlete Challenge Test.
*Hired: Kendra Todd – for attaining a 3–0 record as project manager, having an impressive team record of 10–4, not once being called into the final boardroom by another project manager, and doing such a superb job on her final project.
*Fired: Tana Goertz – for insulting her team members and not leading her team well enough, failing to coordinate the NYC 2012 event smoothly, and potentially for exploiting her immunity during the Week 12 Solstice task.
*Special notes:
**The one-on-one interviews aired on the first part of the May 5, 2005 episode.
**The first part of the final task was aired on May 5, 2005, after Craig&#x27;s firing in the middle of Episode 15.
***During the interviews, Kendra threatened that she would &quot;compete&quot; with Trump if he did not hire her.
***All interviewers unanimously recommended that Craig was not suitable for the Trump Organization.
**Second part of this episode was the allocation of the final tasks.
***Since Kendra and Tana started out on opposing teams, it would become the final battle of Book Smarts vs Street Smarts
**Trump picked three previously fired candidates to serve as the employees of each finalist.
***Employees hired:
***Magna (a.k.a. Book Smarts Team): Michael, Danny, and Erin
***Net Worth (a.k.a. Street Smarts Team): Brian, Chris, and Kristen
**George Ross made a key statement to the assembled teams before they left to begin the task, telling them &quot;Bosses are free to use their employees any way they want to.&quot; This was a major point of contention in the Season 1 finale, with Kwame Jackson wanting to &quot;fire&quot; Omarosa from his team after her repeated mistake and blatant lying, but not being sure if he was allowed to do this; it was also an issue to some extent in Season 2 when Kelly was frustrated with Raj and John&#x27;s laziness and stupidity (though in that case, he did not ask to fire them, but was tempted to before he actually convinced them to work hard for the rest of the task). Kendra and Tana were the 1st finalists to know that they could in fact get rid of useless team members (ironically, despite major issues with at least one of those underlings, neither of them actually did so). Tana actually asked if there was any way they could &quot;discuss&quot; trading some of the employees amongst the teams, and Carolyn immediately told her &quot;No.&quot;
**Although it appeared that Tana and Kendra&#x27;s employees were going to discuss their employers on the finale (based on the ending to the penultimate episode), the finale went directly to the live hiring instead. It was speculated that because Tana&#x27;s performance had been completely thrashed, that the producers decided not to show it. This was in light of the criticism the show received for the endless footage on the previous season where most of the favorable comments were towards Kelly Perdew, and most of the negative feedback was directed towards Jennifer Massey.
**The live finale took place in New York University
**George Ross brought up Tana&#x27;s comments during Week 12 about not having to work due to her immunity. This potentially influenced Trump&#x27;s decision.
**Before the final hiring decision was made, the two potential winning tasks were announced: the renovation of a massive mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, and a managing role with the Trump-owned Miss Universe Pageant. Kendra said she would like the renovation project because it fit with her real estate background and was not far from her home base in Florida, while Tana stated her preference was for the Miss Universe job.
**In addition to becoming the first female &quot;Apprentice&quot;, Kendra became the first winner to never appear in the final boardroom (though the previous season&#x27;s winner, Kelly Perdew only appeared in the final boardroom once, and was exempt on that occasion), along with being the first winner to stay on the original team throughout the entire interview process. Lastly, Kendra was the youngest person to become the Apprentice in all 15 seasons.

==Additional information==
*The BBC showed this series in the UK on BBC2. The first episode aired on August 30, 2006, and the series finished on October 21, 2006.
* Following the season finale, Tana appeared in commercials for the Bedazzler, the very product she insisted on obtaining in the Hanes T-shirt episode. In the commercials, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; is not referred to by name and is only referred to as &quot;national television.&quot;
* Kristen also appeared as a contestant in the 2001 Fox reality series &quot;Murder in Small Town X&quot; as a bleached-blond, wherein she was notable for having established contentious relationships with all of her fellow contestants. She was eliminated at the end of the 6th episode.
* Kendra&#x27;s winning assignment involved overseeing $25 million of renovations to the aforementioned $41 million Trump property in Palm Beach, Florida. The property was recently sold to a Russian billionaire for $100 million, a drop from the initial listing of $125 million but still marking a very large profit for Trump. The billionaire said he and his family have no plans to move to Florida anytime soon.

<doc id="1289866" wikidata="Q2707957" url="?curid=1289866" title="Euproserpinus euterpe">
<text>Euproserpinus euterpe, the Kern primrose sphinx moth or euterpe sphinx moth is a small day-flying moth in the family Sphingidae (sphinx moths). The , light green eggs are laid haphazardly on various plants in the vicinity of the evening primrose host plants (&quot;Camissonia contorta epilobiodes&quot; or &quot;Camissonia campestris&quot;). Larvae emerge from the eggs about a week after oviposition and begin to feed on the flowers and young leaves of the evening primrose. Larvae hatching from eggs laid on other plants are able to wander significant distances to find the host plant.

First-instar larvae (caterpillar phases) are green with dark brown to black heads, legs, lateral spiracles, thoracic shields, and blunt anal horns. Second- and third-instar larvae are green and red, with red heads, thoracic shields, and prolegs (leg-like appendages that are not true legs). Fourth- and fifth-instar larvae (i.e. caterpillars that have shed their skin three or four times) have red to dark red heads, with green and rust-red bodies accented with black areas around spiracles, anal shield and anal horn. The legs are green and the prolegs are red in these mature larvae. Adult moths have a gray ground color with patterned black and brown markings on the forewings. Hindwings are off white with black marginal banding. Males are slightly smaller than the females and are difficult to distinguish, except by close examination of the antennae. These are small sphinx moths with a wing span of a bit more than an inch (25 mm) from tip to tip.

Adults nectar on a variety of flowering species that occur in the region, including, filaree (&quot;Erodium&quot; species), goldfields (&quot;Lasthenia gracilis&quot;), and baby blue eyes (&quot;Nemophila menziesii&quot;). The adult&#x27;s flight season occurs from mid-January to the first week of April, with a peak period in mid-February through mid-March. The timing may vary according to the climatic conditions in the region.

==Distribution==
Distribution is apparently restricted to two locations in California: a privately owned ranch in the Walker Basin, Kern County and the Carrizo Plain National Monument, San Luis Obispo County. The Walker Basin is an agricultural region, primarily growing cereals and cattle. The moth is found in disturbed areas in association with its larval and adult food plants. More specifically, the moth favors the banks of sandy washes, in which the sand has the proper compaction and moisture content for burrowing larvae. It can apparently also use other disturbed areas including road shoulders and abandoned agricultural fields. The population in the Carrizo Plain National Monument was discovered in 2002 and is being managed by the Bureau of Land Management.

==Conservation status==
It once was believed that &quot;Erodium&quot; was a serious threat to the sphinx moth because of larval mortality after eggs were mistakenly deposited on this plant. However, emerging research shows that female moths deposit eggs on plants indiscriminately, and the larvae wander to find a suitable host. &quot;Erodium&quot; is never fed upon. Until 1974 the species was considered to be extinct, at which time a surviving population was found in the eponymous Kern County. Sphinx moths are valuable to insect collectors, who may pose a threat to these small populations. Pesticide or herbicide application could also endanger the moth. But the greatest threat is likely habitat loss and alteration. This species is extremely rare and in most years field surveys of the Walker Basin population have found few or no individuals. However, desert Lepidoptera often show great natural variations in population size in response to climatic conditions, and surveys may more accurately reflect population status in years with above-normal rainfall.

<text>Vincent Samson Appice (born September 13, 1957) is an American rock and metal drummer best known for his work with the bands Dio, Black Sabbath, and Heaven &amp; Hell. Of Italian descent, he is the younger brother of drummer Carmine Appice.

== Career ==
===Pre-Black Sabbath===
Appice took up the drums at the age of nine, taking lessons from the same teacher as his brother Carmine Appice. When he was sixteen, Appice and his band BOMF met John Lennon at Record Plant Studios. Lennon took a liking to the group and used them as a backing band in several performances, including the final one before his death. He moved on to record with Rick Derringer on &quot;Derringer&quot; (1976), &quot;Sweet Evil&quot; (1977), and &quot;Derringer Live&quot; (1977), before forming his own band Axis and recording &quot;It&#x27;s A Circus World&quot; (1978).

===Black Sabbath===
Appice joined Black Sabbath during the tour in support of the band&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; album in 1980. Sharon Arden had approached him with an offer to join Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s new band but he turned it down at the urging of his older brother Carmine. About a month later he was approached by Black Sabbath, whose longtime drummer Bill Ward had just departed mid-tour to deal with personal issues. Appice was told over the phone that Ward was &quot;missing in action&quot;, and he subsequently met with Tony Iommi and the pair hit it off. Iommi was a fan of Appice&#x27;s work on Axis&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s A Circus World&quot; and he invited Appice to meet the rest of the band and rehearse in Los Angeles the following day. When he initially joined Black Sabbath, he was expected to only complete the tour, as it was anticipated that Ward would return at some point. 

Appice&#x27;s first show with Black Sabbath was at the Aloha Stadium in Hawaii. Though he had rehearsed the songs in Los Angeles before leaving for Hawaii, he was forced to use hastily written crib notes on stage for each unfamiliar song. &quot;The endings were a bit sloppy and long, but as the tour went on it got tighter and tighter,&quot; Appice recalled of his early days in the band. After several months it became apparent that Ward would not be returning, and Appice became the band&#x27;s permanent drummer. He subsequently appeared on the 1981 Black Sabbath studio album &quot;Mob Rules&quot; and the 1982 live album &quot;Live Evil&quot;.

===Dio===
In late 1982, vocalist Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath and asked Appice if he&#x27;d be interested in forming a new band with him. Though Appice was still a member of Black Sabbath, he and Dio lived in the same town in New York and the two had a close relationship. As Sabbath were based in England, Appice thought it would be more convenient to stay in the United States and work with Dio, and the band Dio was soon formed along with Vivian Campbell and Jimmy Bain. He recorded the albums &quot;Holy Diver&quot; (1983), &quot;The Last in Line&quot; (1984), &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; (1985), &quot;Intermission&quot; (1986), and &quot;Dream Evil&quot; (1987) with the band. In December of 1989, Appice left Dio and briefly teamed up with ex-Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson in the short-lived band Flesh &amp; Blood.

===Post-Dio===
Ronnie James Dio rejoined Black Sabbath in 1992 to record the album &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;. The band were working with drummer Cozy Powell, but Powell was unable to record after falling off a horse and breaking his pelvis. They immediately called Appice, who flew to Wales to rehearse and record with the band. &quot;I like Vinny, he&#x27;s a nice chap,&quot; Tony Iommi said of the reunion. &quot;Vinny was asked to continue with the Sabbath thing (in 1982), but he didn&#x27;t. I like Vinny&#x27;s playing.&quot; 

Appice rejoined Dio and they recorded &quot;Strange Highways&quot; (1994) and &quot;Angry Machines&quot; (1996). Prior to the 1996 tour, Appice played drums for Las Vegas–based guitarist, Raven Storm, on his album The Storm Project, which also involved long-time Dio engineer and producer, Angelo Arcuri. Arcuri was also a childhood friend of the Appice brothers.

In 2005 Appice appeared on a rap recording by &quot;Circle of Tyrants&quot;, whose lineup included Necro, Ill Bill, Goretex, and Mr Hyde, also collaborating with Alex Skolnick. Appice played two shows in Las Vegas with the Sin City Sinners in October 2009. Appice rejoined his Black Sabbath bandmates Ronnie James Dio, Geezer Butler, and Tony Iommi in 2006 as Heaven &amp; Hell, touring and releasing one studio album, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, before Dio&#x27;s death in 2010.

In 2006 he recorded the CD &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, together with Carl Sentance, Carlos Cavazo and Jeff Pilson. The CD was produced by guitarist-musician Andy Menario (leader of Martiria band) and featured lyrics written by Italian poet Marco Roberto Capelli, who is also Martiria&#x27;s lyricist.

He is currently participating in &quot;Drum Wars&quot; shows with his brother Carmine, which feature a guest appearance from vocalist Paul Shortino.

Appice formed the band Kill Devil Hill with former Down and Pantera bassist Rex Brown, guitar slinger Mark Zavon and lead vocalist Dewey Bragg. Kill Devil Hill&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released May 22, 2012, via Steamhammer/SPV and landed at No. 9 on the Billboard Top New Artist Albums (HeatSeekers) Chart, No. 41 on the Top Hard Music Chart and No. 50 on the Independent Album Chart.

Following the death of Dio frontman Ronnie James Dio in 2010, the original lineup of Vinny Appice on drums, Jimmy Bain on bass, Vivian Campbell on guitar and Claude Schnell on keyboards reunited along with vocalist Andrew Freeman to perform covers of Dio songs they originally recorded. This lineup, without Schnell, would become Last in Line.

On November 25, 2013, it was announced that Appice had formed a new band called WAMI, which features vocalist Doogie White, bassist Marco Mendoza, and 16-year-old Polish guitarist Iggy Gwadera. On February 12, 2014, the upcoming album title was revealed to be &quot;Kill the King&quot;, due for release in the spring. On February 25, the album cover and track listing were revealed.

On March 10, 2014, it was announced that Appice had left Kill Devil Hill, and that former Type O Negative drummer Johnny Kelly was his replacement.

Last in Line began recording tracks for a new album of original material in April 2014, followed by the release of a snippet of the new track &quot;Devil in Me&quot; in June. The album, &quot;Heavy Crown&quot;, produced by former Dio bassist Jeff Pilson, was released in early 2016. The band has since released further albums.

In early 2014 Appice joined hard rock band Hollywood Monsters where he played on the album &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (on 8 tracks out of 11) which was released in 2014 on Mausoleum Records. The album features Steph Honde on vocals and guitars, Tim Bogert on bass, Don Airey on keyboards and Paul Di&#x27;Anno on lead vocals on the bonus track. The same year, Appice was a guest performer on Eli Cook&#x27;s album, &quot;Primitive Son&quot;.

In 2015, it was announced that Appice would appear on the EP &quot;Mainly Songs About Robots&quot; by Australian progressive rock band Toehider, to be released in September 2015. The same year, Appice was invited to play drums for a new project of Whitesnake and former Night Ranger guitarist Joel Hoekstra, called Joel Hoekstra&#x27;s 13, with an album called &quot;Dying to Live&quot;, released on October 16.

On September 30, the band Resurrection Kings was announced. The band is formed by Appice with former Dio guitarist Craig Goldy, Sean McNabb on bass and Chas West on vocals.

On January 18, 2017, Appice was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for his contributions to Heavy Metal drumming.

In 2023, Vinny put together a new touring band called Sabbath Knights, performing the music of Black Sabbath and Dio.

<doc id="1289877" wikidata="Q360422" url="?curid=1289877" title="Lee Evans (American football)">
<text>Lee Evans III (born March 11, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Wisconsin Badgers. Evans was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft with the 13th overall pick. He also played for the Baltimore Ravens.

As the highest drafted receiver for the Bills since Eric Moulds, Evans emerged as a dangerous deep threat for the team. He still ranks among the top five receivers in Bills history in terms of receptions, yards, and touchdowns, despite never making the Pro Bowl.

==Early life==
Evans was born in Bedford, Ohio, a suburb located southeast of Cleveland, and attended Bedford High School. Evans was also a high hurdler, with personal-bests of 13.59 seconds in the 110 metres hurdles and 37.32 seconds in the 300 metres hurdles.

==College career==

Evans caught 30 passes for 528 yards and 5 touchdowns in his freshman season at Wisconsin in 2000.

In 2001, Evans put together an incredible season despite having three different quarterbacks (Brooks Bollinger, Jim Sorgi, and Matt Schabert) during the year. Evans caught 75 passes for 1,545 yards (an average of 20.1 yards per reception) and 9 touchdowns.

Evans tore his ACL in the 2002 Spring Game and missed the entire season.

In Evans&#x27;s last year at Wisconsin in 2003, the star receiver put together a season to remember for the Badgers. He caught 64 passes for 1,213 yards and 13 touchdowns. Possibly his finest game as a Badger came in a 56–21 blowout of the Michigan State Spartans: Evans caught 10 passes for 258 yards and 5 touchdowns.

==Professional career==
===Buffalo Bills===
The Buffalo Bills selected Evans with the 13th overall pick in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. Lee was the first wide receiver since Eric Moulds in 1996 to be taken by the Bills in the first round.

Evans was initially assigned the jersey number 84. Evans, as a reference to his full name, had always worn the number 3 in college, a number that was not allowed to be used in the National Football League for wide receivers. At that time, receivers and tight ends were only allowed to wear uniform numbers 80–89. Evans, in order to include the number 3 somewhere in his jersey number, instead chose 83, which required special permission; the Bills had set aside the number after the retirement of former Bills great Andre Reed.

The Bills&#x27; first-round draft pick moved into the starting lineup in his first season and emerged as one of the Bills&#x27; best players on offense. He caught 48 passes for 843 yards and 9 touchdowns as a rookie. The nine touchdowns remains a Bills rookie record.

During a game between the Bills and Miami Dolphins on December 4, 2005, Evans faced off against his former teammate on the Wisconsin Badgers, Chris Chambers. Evans set then career highs with receiving yards (117) and touchdowns (3), but Chambers set Miami franchise records for receptions (15) and receiving yards (238) as well as scoring the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds.

Evans quickly became a fan-favorite among Bills fans. After the departure of Eric Moulds, he established himself as the Bills&#x27; top receiver in 2006 with 82 receptions for 1,292 receiving yards and 8 touchdowns. He became a big ally for then starting quarterback J. P. Losman in the passing game, establishing himself as a deep threat at wide receiver. On November 19, 2006, in a game against the Houston Texans, he set the Buffalo Bills record for receiving yards in one quarter (205) and one game (265). He also became the first player in league history to record two 80-yard-plus touchdowns in one quarter when he caught two 83-yard touchdown passes in the first quarter.

In a 2007 game against the New York Jets, Evans wrestled a long pass away from Jets rookie cornerback Darrelle Revis, which resulted in an 85-yard touchdown reception to clinch the game for the Bills as they won 13–3.

Evans underwent minor shoulder surgery in the 2008 offseason. Coach Dick Jauron stated that the shoulder had been bothering Evans for the previous two years. The offseason surgery did not seem to slow Evans down in the 2008 season as he recorded his second 1,000 yards receiving season with 63 receptions, 1,017 yards, and three touchdowns, including an 87-yard score from Losman, who had since been relegated to the backup for Trent Edwards. Despite his strong play the Bills missed the postseason at 7–9. The next two seasons were less successful for Evans, as his yardage and touchdown count regressed both years with Terrell Owens and later Stevie Johnson taking over Evans&#x27; role as Buffalo&#x27;s top receiver.

On December 12, 2010, Evans injured his ankle against the Cleveland Browns and was placed on injured reserve, which would be the last time he suited up for the Bills. Evans finished his Buffalo career with the third most receiving yards (5,934) and touchdowns (43) in franchise history, in addition to the fourth most receptions (377), which included six passes that each went for more than 70 yards.

===Baltimore Ravens===
On August 12, 2011, Evans was traded to the Baltimore Ravens for a 4th round pick in the 2012 NFL draft. He missed a fair amount of the season with injuries. Evans played in 9 games, and finished the season with four receptions for 74 yards. In the AFC Championship Game, a pass was thrown to Evans in the end zone that if caught, would have likely secured a trip to the Super Bowl for the Ravens. The football hit Evans in the hands, but was knocked out by New England Patriots cornerback Sterling Moore. Two plays later, Billy Cundiff missed a field goal that would have sent the game into overtime, and the Patriots won.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
On April 15, 2012, Evans signed a one-year contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was released on August 12.

===Retirement===
In 2012, after he was released by the Jacksonville Jaguars, Evans announced his retirement.

<text>To dunk or to dip a biscuit or some other food, usually baked goods, means to submerge it into a drink, especially tea, coffee, or milk. Dunking releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars, while also softening their texture. Dunking can be used to melt chocolate on biscuits to create a richer flavour.

Dunking is a popular way of enjoying biscuits in many countries. A popular form of dunking in Australia is the &quot;Tim Tam Slam&quot;, also known as &#x27;tea sucking&#x27;. The physics of dunking is driven by the porosity of the biscuit and the surface tension of the beverage. A biscuit is porous and, when dunked, capillary action draws the liquid into the interstices between the crumbs.

Dunking is first reported with ancient Romans softening their hard unleavened wafers (Latin: &quot;bis coctum&quot; – &quot;twice baked&quot;) in wine. Modern day dunking has its roots in naval history when, in the 16th century, biscuits known as &quot;hard tack&quot; were on board Royal Navy ships, which were so hard that the British sailors would dunk them in beer in order to soften them up. The most popular biscuit to dunk in tea in the United Kingdom is McVitie&#x27;s chocolate digestive. In the US, Oreos are frequently dunked in milk, while the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts franchise is named for the practice of dunking doughnuts into coffee. In South Africa and in India, rusks are a popular food for dunking in both tea and coffee. In the Netherlands, stroopwafels are commonly dunked in tea or coffee, often after having been set on above the hot drink for a few minutes to melt the caramel inside. In Nigeria, bread is commonly dunked in tea or hot chocolate, while Acarajé is dunked in pap. In Australia and New Zealand gingernut biscuits are commonly dunked in tea or coffee. most commonly these are Arnotts brand Ginger Nuts.

Dunking is also used as a slang term for intinction: the Eucharistic practice of partly dipping the consecrated bread, or host, into the consecrated wine, by the officiant before distributing.

== Etiquette and style ==
While modern day dunking has its origins in 16th century naval history, it wasn&#x27;t until the 19th century and the emergence of afternoon tea in the early Victorian era that Great Britain began to regard biscuits as something to be dunked in tea, a British custom that was later exported around the globe. Different cultures have different attitudes toward biscuit dunking. Historically in British high society, dunking was frowned upon and generally seen as children&#x27;s or working class fashion. However, Queen Victoria herself was said to enjoy dunking her biscuits, a German custom from her younger days. In 2007, a tea room in Brighton, England, banned dunking on its premises.

In the United States, the act took on a marketing purpose for doughnut sellers in the 1930s. They formed the National Dunking Association, which prompted members to follow &quot;rules for dunking&quot; and used the association to market their products.

== Science ==

Physicist Len Fisher of the University of Bristol presented some light-hearted discussion of dunking on &quot;National Biscuit Dunking Day&quot; in the UK, as part of an attempt to make physics accessible. Fisher appeared to be somewhat taken aback by the large amount of media attention, ascribing it to a &quot;hunger for accessible science&quot;. Fisher also described his astonishment at journalists&#x27; interest in one equation used in the field: Washburn&#x27;s equation, which describes capillary flow in porous materials. Writing in &quot;Nature&quot;, he says &quot;the equation was published in almost every major UK newspaper. The journalists who published it took great care to get it right, some telephoning several times to check&quot;. Fisher was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1999, for his research into biscuit dunking.

In 2012, Michelin-starred English restaurateur Heston Blumenthal researched the effect of dunking chocolate biscuits, and concluded that it improved the biscuit&#x27;s taste. &quot;If you have chocolate on one side, if it melts a bit, you get a velvety smooth texture and then the delicious flavour as a result.&quot;

In 2022, a comparative study concluded that a hobnob style biscuit maintains its integrity for the longest after being dunked in a hot drink.

<doc id="1289893" wikidata="Q165227" url="?curid=1289893" title="Physalis peruviana">
<text>Physalis peruviana is a species of plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to Chile and Peru. Within that region, it is called aguaymanto, uvilla or uchuva, in addition to numerous indigenous and regional names. In English, its common names include Cape gooseberry, goldenberry and Peruvian groundcherry.

The history of &quot;Physalis peruviana&quot; cultivation in South America can be traced to the Inca Empire. It has been cultivated in England since the late 18th century, and in South Africa in the Cape of Good Hope since at least the start of the 19th century. Widely introduced in the 20th century, &quot;Physalis peruviana&quot; is now cultivated or grows wild across the world in temperate and tropical regions.

==Taxonomy and common names==
&quot;Physalis peruviana&quot; was given a botanical species description by Carl Linnaeus in 1763. and given the genus name &quot;Physalis&quot; after the - physallís, “bladder, wind instrument” in reference to the calyx that surrounds the berry. The specific name &quot;peruviana&quot; refer to the country of Peru, one of the countries of the berry&#x27;s origin.

In Peru, &quot;P. peruviana&quot; is known as in Spanish and in Quechua. In neighboring Colombia, it is known by its Aymara name as , and as &quot;uvilla&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;little grape&#x27;) in Ecuador.

It was grown in England in 1774 and by early settlers of the Cape of Good Hope before 1807. Whether it was grown there before its introduction to England is not known, but sources since the mid-19th century attribute the common English name &quot;Cape gooseberry&quot; to this fact. An alternative suggestion is that name refers to the calyx surrounding the fruit like a cape, possibly an example of false etymology, because it does not appear in publications earlier than the mid-20th century. Not long after its introduction to South Africa, &quot;P. peruviana&quot; was introduced to Australia, New Zealand and various Pacific islands. Despite its common name, it is not botanically related to the true gooseberries of the genus &quot;Ribes&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;P. peruviana&quot; is closely related to the tomatillo. As a member of the plant family Solanaceae, it is also more distantly related to a large number of edible plants, including tomatoes, eggplants, and potatoes.

&quot;P. peruviana&quot; is an annual in temperate locations, but a perennial in the tropics. As a perennial, it develops into a diffusely branched shrub reaching in height, with spreading branches and velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The hermaphrodite flowers are bell-shaped and drooping, across, yellow with purple-brown spots internally. After the flower falls, the calyx expands, ultimately forming a beige husk fully enclosing the fruit.

The fruit is a round, smooth berry, resembling a miniature yellow tomato wide. Removed from its calyx, it is bright yellow to orange in color, and sweet when ripe, with a characteristic, mildly tart grape-like flavor.

A prominent feature is the inflated, papery calyx enclosing each berry. The calyx is until the fruit is fully grown; at first, it is of normal size, but after the petals fall, it continues to grow until it forms a protective cover around the growing fruit. If the fruit is left inside the intact calyx husks, its shelf life at room temperature is about 30–45 days. The calyx is inedible.

===Nutrition===
Raw cape gooseberries are 85% water, 11% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw cape gooseberries supply 53 calories and provide moderate levels (10–19% of the Daily Value) of niacin and vitamin C.

Analyses of oil from different berry components, primarily its seeds, showed that linoleic acid and oleic acid were the main fatty acids, beta-sitosterol and campesterol were principal phytosterols, and the oil contained vitamin K and beta-carotene.

==Distribution and habitat==
The center of genetic diversity for &quot;Physalis peruviana&quot; is in the Andes mountains of Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. It grows in forests, forest edges, and riparian areas. It grows at high elevations of in its native region, but may also be found at sea level in Oceania and Pacific islands where it occurs widely in subtropical and warm, temperate conditions. Its latitude range is about 45°S to 60°N, and its altitude range is generally from sea level to . The plant has become invasive in some natural habitats, forming thickets, particularly in Hawaii and on other Pacific islands. There are believed to be dozens of ecotypes worldwide that differentiated by plant size, calyx shape, and the size, color, and flavor of the fruit. Wild forms are thought to be diploid with 2&quot;n&quot; = 24 chromosomes, while cultivated forms include varieties with increased ploidy and 32 or 48 chromosomes.

==Cultivation==
It has been widely introduced into cultivation in tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas such as Australia, China, India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. &quot;P. peruviana&quot; thrives at an annual average temperature from , tolerating temperatures as high as . It grows well in Mediterranean climates and is hardy to USDA hardiness zone 8, meaning it can be damaged by frost. It grows well in rainfall amounts of if the soil is well drained, and prefers full sun or partial shade in well-drained soil, and grows vigorously in sandy loam.

The plant is readily grown from seeds, which are abundant (100 to 300 in each fruit), but with low germination rates, requiring thousands of seeds to sow a hectare. Plants grown from year-old stem cuttings will flower early and yield well, but are less vigorous than those grown from seed.

===Pests and diseases===
In South Africa, cutworms attack the Cape gooseberry in seedbeds, red spiders in the field, and potato tuber moths near potato fields. Hares damage young plants, and birds eat the fruits. Mites, whiteflies and flea beetles can also be problematic. Powdery mildew, soft brown scale, root rot and viruses may affect plants. In New Zealand, plants can be infected by &quot;Candidatus&quot; &quot;Liberibacter solanacearum&quot;.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
&quot;P. peruviana&quot; is an economically useful crop as an exotic exported fruit, and is favored in breeding and cultivation programs of many countries. &quot;P. peruviana&quot; fruits are marketed in the United States as &quot;goldenberry&quot; and sometimes &quot;Pichuberry&quot;, named after Machu Picchu in order to associate the fruit with its cultivation in Peru.

Cape gooseberries are made into fruit-based sauces, pies, puddings, chutneys, jams and ice cream, or eaten fresh in salads and fruit salads. In Latin America, it is often consumed as a &quot;batido&quot; or smoothie, and because of its showy husk, it is used in restaurants as a decorative garnish for desserts. To enhance its food uses, hot air drying improves qualities of dietary fiber content, texture and appearance.

In basic research on fruit maturation, the content of polyphenols and vitamin C varied by cultivar, harvest time, and ripening stage.

===Potential for toxicity===
Unripe raw fruits, flowers, leaves, and stems of the plant contain solanine and solanidine alkaloids that may cause poisoning if ingested by humans, cattle or horses.

<doc id="1289899" wikidata="Q5167573" url="?curid=1289899" title="Coombe, Croydon">
<text>Coombe is a place in the London Borough of Croydon, situated south-east of central Croydon, between Addiscombe, Selsdon and Upper Shirley. Formerly a hamlet, since the growth of suburban development the area has become swallowed into the London conurbation and often does not appear on modern map.

Coombe is located between the green spaces of Addington Hills, Lloyd Park, Ballards and Coombe Wood. It is unusual in this part of South London as it has barely been urbanised and has retained its collection of large houses fairly intact. Its rural character is maintained by the woodland aspect of the road and an old cattle trough at the junction of Coombe Lane and Oaks Road. Tramlink, however, runs through Coombe. Coombe Lane, the continuation of Coombe Road, is the principal road. Conduit Lane is an ancient unpaved route that is now a woodland path.

There was an estate at Coombe as far back as 1221, recorded as being held by Richard of Coombe. The name comes from the Old English &#x27;cumb&#x27;, meaning a valley. In Elizabethan times, it was known as Broad Coombe. In the 17th century, it was owned by the brothers of William Harvey, who first described the circulation of blood.

== Early history ==
In 1722, &quot;Some Persons, digging at a Village call&#x27;d Coomb, near Croydon in Surry, found a great Number of Roman Urns, and other Antique Curiosities&quot; &quot;(sic)&quot;. The nearby town of Croydon originally developed due to a Roman road, and part of a Roman road has been found in Coombe Street, Croydon.

== The houses of Coombe ==
Coombe House to the north of the road (), it dates back to 1761 and is Grade II listed. It is on the site of an older house, the Harveys&#x27; home. William Harvey stayed at the house frequently and had tunnels dug in the grounds in order to meditate in the dark. A 145 ft-deep well in the grounds of the house was said to be used by pilgrims to Canterbury on their journey to join the Pilgrims&#x27; Way, having come via the Archbishop&#x27;s Croydon Palace. A Grade II listed brick icehouse is also in the grounds. Substantial changes were made to the house in the 1830s. It was bought in the 1890s by Frank Lloyd, a newspaper magnate. His father Edward Lloyd founded &quot;Lloyd Weekly Newspaper&quot;, later known as &quot;The Sunday News&quot;, and also the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;. He lived in Coombe House for 35 years until his death in 1927. Neighbouring Lloyd Park, created from land bequeathed by Lloyd, is named after him. The house was owned by an NHS Trust and was called Geoffrey Harris House. It is now owned by PACT Educational Trust and, in September 2013 reopened as The Cedars School, an independent all-boys senior school with a Catholic ethos. However the school relocated to Upper Norwood in September 2021. It is now occupied by Oakwood Prep School, also part of PACT Educational Trust.

Coombe Lodge is a Grade II Listed Georgian red brick mansion built by the 1760s. ()
It was once called Coombe Gate House or Coombe Green House. In 1761, the estate joined with Coombe House and Coombe Farm, an estate that was split and reunited several times. A large conservatory, still there, was added in the late 19th century. After World War II the estate was bought by the County Borough of Croydon, which used the house as a home for the elderly. The Council&#x27;s Parks Department built the Central Nursery in the grounds, and continued to be used until recently for growing Croydon&#x27;s plants and making &quot;Croypost&quot;, the municipal compost. Coombe Lodge was sold in 1988 and is now a restaurant and bar, with a large garden and the conservatory for public seating.

Coombe Wood House () was built in 1898 for Arthur Lloyd, brother of Frank Lloyd. Some years later, then-owner William Cash sold the house to Croydon Corporation, which used the house as a convalescent and children&#x27;s home. It is now a French restaurant, the Château (originally the &quot;Château Napoleon&quot;). The ornamental gardens and 14 acres (57,000 m2) of woodland were kept by the Council and opened to the public in 1948. Coombe Wood Gardens are very popular, with a café in the old stable block, the &quot;Coach House Café&quot;.

Coombe Farm is a large farmhouse off Oaks Road, reached via Oaks Lane. Oaks Lane was the former main road, closed by John Maberly of Shirley House in 1803 to increase his privacy. Oaks Road was its replacement. Oaks Lane is a road used by residents in Coombe and turns into a track for walkers beyond a disused quarry Scout camp, running past Oaks Farm and through the Shirley Park golf course to the Upper Shirley Road. The main Coombe Farm building dates from the 16th century, with 19th-century additions. Croydon local studies library archives show that the oldest part of the standing Coombe Farm farmhouse first stood on the site in the late 16th century. There is within the building an inscription on an oak beam with the date 1642. The farmhouse is clearly visible in John Rocque&#x27;s 1745 plan of London and appears in the first Ordnance Survey plan published in 1882. Historic sources indicate that much of the current fabric (behind the Tudor frontage) are Victorian additions dating from 1844 and 1893. In 1893, another brother of Frank Lloyd, Herbert, built a much larger new building with mock-Tudor features beside the original building. Although most of the &#x27;outbuildings&#x27; (some attached to the substantive building, some not) are likely to post-date those extensions in appearance they are late Victorian/Edwardian. This is with the exception of 1960s bungalows on the site. It is notable that throughout the cartographic record that the boundary of the &#x27;farmyard&#x27; has remained fairly constant throughout. The farm is now a location for residences, the AlFatihah mosque and an office for Dr. Anwar Ansari&#x27;s housing services and property development company AA Homes &amp; Housing Limited. There are also old farmhouses and lodges along Oaks Lane.

== Towards Croydon ==

Between Lloyd Park and central Croydon, considerable amounts of 20th-century housing was built, particularly in Park Hill. There were estates here too, with two houses surviving a mile from Coombe itself.
Coombe Cliff on Coombe Road was the home of the Horniman family of tea merchants. John Horniman (1803–1893) and Frederick John Horniman (1835–1906) are known as public benefactors and politicians. Frederick is remembered as the founder of the Horniman Museum. In 1850 John Horniman bought a piece of land known as The Warren and in 1853 he employed the Brown building firm to build a house on the site for him. Coombe Cliff had an important example of a Victorian conservatory with fine ironwork, used for Horniman&#x27;s plant collection. Its glasswork created a shimmering effect in sunlight. Originally erected in 1894 as a &#x27;lean-to&#x27; conservatory, and derelict by 1982, it was dismantled, refurbished and reconstructed as a free-standing conservatory adjacent to the Horniman Museum (in Forest Hill, London) in 1987, where it is in use for recitals, receptions etc.
In 1930 Croydon Corporation purchased the house and gardens for a convalescent home for children, and it had several other uses before finally being used as an adult education centre in 1960. Coombe Cliff&#x27;s gardens were merged into neighbouring Park Hill and opened to the public.

Coombe Hill House is a red-brick townhouse on Coombe Road, now considered central Croydon but until the 20th century in a rural setting. It was built around 1713 and is attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, although this is likely to be estate agent hype. It was expanded by Robert Amadeus Heath, 2nd Baron Heath, Italian Consul General, in the 19th century before becoming a boys&#x27; preparatory school. In 1966 it was bought by Croydon&#x27;s labour, trade union and co-operative movement and developed into their headquarters, Ruskin House. It retains its sash windows, brick wall and large cedar tree.

== Towards Addington ==

The Ballards estate was a major landholding to the east of Coombe. Until the Reformation it was Prior Ballards, and then passed to the Leigh family of Addington. In 1872, Charles Hermann Goschen, Lord Lieutenant of the City of London and brother of the prominent politician George Joachim Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen, bought the estate and built a new mansion, demolishing the old building. In the 1920s, the estate was donated to the trustees of the Warehousemen, Drapers, and Haberdashers, School. The new school, built to the side of the mansion, was designed by Sir Aston Webb, architect of Imperial College. The school is now known as Royal Russell School.
Heathfield House () was also bought by Goschen in 1872, who rebuilt the former farmhouse and leased it to his brother Henry, one of the last serving members of the East India Company. The house was sold in 1919 to Howard Houlder a former mayor of Croydon and a member of the Houlder Line shipping family. The property was sold a short time later to a Mr. Costain. In 1937, Raymond Riesco bought the property, creating banks of rhododendrons and a walled garden. Riesco arranged for the house, gardens and farmland to be bought by Croydon Council upon his death and donated his collection of oriental ceramics. The house is now the Council&#x27;s training centre, with the gardens open to the public. The farm is still cultivated, with part used as horse pasture and the Monks Hill estate built on the eastern end. Part of the grounds are also home to the Croydon Ecology Centre. The house is Grade II listed.

== Public transport ==

With the introduction of Croydon Tramlink the 353 bus route that served Coombe was discontinued beyond Addington Village Interchange leaving Coombe with improved privacy but modest public transport links with tramstops some distance from Coombe. The nearest are Coombe Lane tram stop and Lloyd Park tram stop. The area&#x27;s train station - Coombe Road railway station - closed in 1983.

== Coombe Wood School ==
In 2018, Coombe Wood School opened on the former playing fields at the junction of Melville Avenue and Coombe Road (close to Lloyd Park). Initially in a temporary structure, construction began on a permanent facility in 2019, expected to open in September 2020.

<doc id="1289901" wikidata="Q3615432" url="?curid=1289901" title="Andre Carter">
<text>Rubin Andre Carter (born May 12, 1979) is an American football coach and former player in the National Football League (NFL) A defensive end, he played college football for the California Golden Bears, and was a unanimous All-American. The San Francisco 49ers selected him with the seventh overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft, and he also played for the Washington Redskins, New England Patriots and Oakland Raiders. Carter currently is retired.

==Early life==
Carter was born in Denver, Colorado. He attended Oak Grove High School in San Jose, California. As a senior, he was a &quot;USA Today&quot; All-America high school selection, and the Gatorade California Player of the Year. He was also rated as the top defensive lineman and a high school All-America selection by &quot;Parade&quot; magazine.

==College career==
Carter attended the University of California, Berkeley, and played for the California Golden Bears from 1997 to 2000. During his junior and senior years he was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection. As a senior in 2000, he won the Morris Trophy, awarded to the Pac-10&#x27;s top defensive lineman, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. In addition to being selected as the Golden Bears&#x27; most valuable player, Carter was also a finalist for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, given to the nation&#x27;s top defensive player.

==Professional career==
===San Francisco 49ers===
Carter was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the 2001 NFL draft. In the 2005 NFL season, because the 49ers implemented a 3-4 defense under Head Coach Mike Nolan, Carter was moved to outside linebacker. While playing for the 49ers, he made 154 solo tackles, 32 sacks, and 12 pass deflections in 69 games.

===Washington Redskins===

Carter signed a six-year, $30 million contract with the Washington Redskins as an unrestricted free agent on March 14, 2006. The Redskins moved Carter back to defensive end, his natural position. In his first year with the Redskins, he had 56 total tackles and six sacks. He showed much improvement in 2007, with 55 tackles, 10.5 sacks, and four forced fumbles. He also had a safety in a 34–3 win over the Detroit Lions. Carter&#x27;s best season as a Redskin came in 2009 when he totalled 11 sacks. However, in 2010 the Redskins hired a new coach, Mike Shanahan, who changed their 4-3 defense to a 3-4 defense which required Carter to play outside linebacker. Carter was never fully comfortable with the move. By mid-season, and at Carter&#x27;s request, the coaching staff had him playing from a three-point stance on passing downs. The Redskins released Carter on March 1, 2011.

===New England Patriots===
Carter announced on his Twitter page on August 7, 2011, that he would be playing for the New England Patriots in the 2011 NFL season. This was later confirmed by Ian Rapoport of the Boston Herald and Michael Lombardi of the NFL Network. According to Rapoport, Carter signed a one-year deal with a base salary of $1.75m. He also received a $500k signing bonus and the chance to earn another $500k in incentives, making the contract worth up to $2.75 million. On November 13, 2011, Carter had a career game against the New York Jets, recording 4 sacks and tying the Patriots single game sack record. On Sunday, December 18, 2011, while playing against the Denver Broncos, Carter tore his left quadriceps tendon and missed the remainder of the 2011 regular season as well as the playoffs, as he underwent surgery. Despite being injured, Carter was one of eight Patriots honored by a selection to the 2012 Pro Bowl.

====Patriots franchise record====
* Most sacks in a single game: 4 (2011) (vs New York Jets) (tied)

===Oakland Raiders===
On September 26, 2012, the Oakland Raiders announced they had signed Carter. On April 9, 2013, Carter re-signed with the Raiders on a one-year deal. On August 31, 2013, he was released.

===New England Patriots===
Carter re-signed with the Patriots on October 22, 2013, to add a veteran presence to a Patriots defense that lost Vince Wilfork and Jerod Mayo to season-ending injuries earlier in the season.

===Career statistics===
==Coaching career==
In August 2015, Carter returned to California as an undergraduate assistant. On February 10, 2017, Carter was hired by the Miami Dolphins as an assistant defensive line coach.
When Adam Gase was fired by Miami and subsequently hired by the New York Jets, Carter moved with Gase to New York and became the Jets&#x27; defensive line coach.

In 2021 Carter became the defensive line coach at Louisiana State University (LSU).

On February 2, 2024, Carter was hired as a pass rush specialist under new Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce and general manager Tom Telesco.

==Personal life==
Carter is the son of former Denver Broncos defensive tackle Rubin Carter. He has a wife, Bethany, and two children: stepdaughter, Aysha, born in 1993, and a son, Quincy, born in 2007. His middle name was given to him by his father who named him after his close friend and teammate Andre Townsend.

<doc id="1289902" wikidata="Q555308" url="?curid=1289902" title="Anthony Grafton">
<text>Anthony Thomas Grafton (born May 21, 1950) is an American historian of early modern Europe and the Henry Putnam University Professor of History at Princeton University, where he is also the Director the Program in European Cultural Studies. He is also a corresponding fellow of the British Academy and a recipient of the Balzan Prize. From January 2011 to January 2012, he served as the President of the American Historical Association. From 2006 to 2020, Grafton was co-executive editor of the &quot;Journal of the History of Ideas&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Grafton was born on May 21, 1950, in New Haven, Connecticut. He was educated at Phillips Academy.

He attended the University of Chicago, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1971 and a Master of Arts degree in 1972. He made Phi Beta Kappa in 1970, with honors in history and in the college. After studying at University College, London, under ancient historian Arnaldo Momigliano, from 1973 to 1974, he earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree in history from the University of Chicago in 1975. He still retains links with the University of London&#x27;s Warburg Institute.

Grafton married Louise Erlich in 1972, and was married to her until her death in 2019. They had two children. 

==Career==
After a brief period teaching at Cornell&#x27;s history department, he was appointed to a position at Princeton University in 1975, where he has subsequently remained. In 2006, he became co-editor of the &quot;Journal of the History of Ideas&quot;, together with Warren Breckman, Martin Burke, and Ann Moyer.

==Works==
Anthony Grafton is noted for his studies of the classical tradition from the Renaissance to the eighteenth century, and in the history of historical scholarship. His many books include a study of the scholarship and chronology of Renaissance scholar Joseph Scaliger (2 vols, 1983–1993), and, more recently, studies of Girolamo Cardano as an astrologer (1999) and Leon Battista Alberti (2000). In 1996, he delivered the Triennial E. A. Lowe Lectures at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, speaking on Ancient History in Early Modern Europe. Together with Lisa Jardine, he also co-wrote a revisionist account of the significance of Renaissance education (&quot;From Humanism to the Humanities&quot;, 1986) and on the marginalia of Gabriel Harvey.

He also penned several essay collections, including &quot;Defenders of the Text&quot; (1991), which deals with the relations between scholarship and science in the early modern period, and, most recently, &quot;Worlds Made by Words&quot;. His most original and accessible book is &quot;The Footnote: A Curious History&quot; (1997; originally published in German in 1995 as &quot;Die tragischen Ursprünge der deutschen Fußnote&quot;), a case study of how the marginal footnote developed as a central and powerful tool in the hands of historians.

He also writes on a wide variety of topics for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. He owns a bookwheel which he keeps at hand in his home.

<text>The Ministry of Defense (, , , ) is the cabinet ministry of Afghanistan responsible for overseeing the Afghan Armed Forces (currently referred to as the Islamic Emirate Armed Forces). The ministry is located in Kabul.

==The Democratic Republic period==

From the 30th of April until 9 August 1978, Abdul Qadir succeeded the slain Ghulam Haidar Rasuli as Defense Minister of the DRA, responsible for the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, until being succeeded by General Aslam Watanjar. In 1990 forces loyal to Minister of Defense Shahnawaz Tanai and Hezbi Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar attempted a fail coup against then President Najibullah. His forces were thwarted by General Aslam Watanjar who was rewarded the post of Minister of Defence. Watanjar would be the last Minister of Defense of the DRA/ROA. The government collapsed in 1992. 

Additionally, the Ministry of Defense also had their own annual publication titled “The Military Magazine” (, ) which began in 1967, under the Kingdom of Afghanistan. This was continued under the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.

==The Islamic Republic period==
During the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004–2021), the defense minister was nominated by the President of Afghanistan and the National Assembly made the final approval.

One of the functions of the Defense Ministry during that period was the continuance of disarming insurgent groups, through programmes such as the Afghan New Beginnings Programme (which included the rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers). These militant groups coalesced from warlords and former army personnel after the collapse of the Najibullah government in 1992. 

==List of ministers==
Prior to 1929, Afghanistan had no ministers of defense but rather ministers of war.

=== Ministers of War ===
* Mohammad Nadir, May 1919 to January 1922
* Mohammad Hashim, January 1922 to September 1922
* Mohammad Nadir, September 1922 to April 1924
* Muhammad Wali, April 1924 to June 1924
* Abdul Aziz Barakzai, June 1924 to January 1929

<doc id="1289909" wikidata="Q1280083" url="?curid=1289909" title="Washburn's equation">
<text>In physics, Washburn&#x27;s equation describes capillary flow in a bundle of parallel cylindrical tubes; it is extended with some issues also to imbibition into porous materials. The equation is named after Edward Wight Washburn; also known as Lucas–Washburn equation, considering that Richard Lucas wrote a similar paper three years earlier, or the Bell-Cameron-Lucas-Washburn equation, considering J.M. Bell and F.K. Cameron&#x27;s discovery of the form of the equation in 1906.

==Derivation==

In its most general form the Lucas Washburn equation describes the penetration length (formula_1) of a liquid into a capillary pore or tube with time formula_2 as formula_3, where formula_4 is a simplified diffusion coefficient. This relationship, which holds true for a variety of situations, captures the essence of Lucas and Washburn&#x27;s equation and shows that capillary penetration and fluid transport through porous structures exhibit diffusive behaviour akin to that which occurs in numerous physical and chemical systems. The diffusion coefficient formula_4 is governed by the geometry of the capillary as well as the properties of the penetrating fluid. 
A liquid having a dynamic viscosity formula_6 and surface tension formula_7 will penetrate a distance formula_1 into the capillary whose pore radius is formula_9 following the relationship:

formula_10

Where formula_11 is the contact angle between the penetrating liquid and the solid (tube wall).

Washburn&#x27;s equation is also used commonly to determine the contact angle of a liquid to a powder using a force tensiometer.

In the case of porous materials, many issues have been raised both about the physical meaning of the calculated pore radius formula_9 and the real possibility to use this equation for the calculation of the contact angle of the solid.
The equation is derived for capillary flow in a cylindrical tube in the absence of a gravitational field, but is sufficiently accurate in many cases when the capillary force is still significantly greater than the gravitational force.

In his paper from 1921 Washburn applies Poiseuille&#x27;s Law for fluid motion in a circular tube. Inserting the expression for the differential volume in terms of the length formula_13 of fluid in the tube formula_14, one obtains

:formula_15

where formula_16 is the sum over the participating pressures, such as the atmospheric pressure formula_17, the hydrostatic pressure formula_18 and the equivalent pressure due to capillary forces formula_19. formula_6 is the viscosity of the liquid, and formula_21 is the coefficient of slip, which is assumed to be 0 for wetting materials. formula_9 is the radius of the capillary. The pressures in turn can be written as

:formula_23
:formula_24

where formula_25 is the density of the liquid and formula_7 its surface tension. formula_27 is the angle of the tube with respect to the horizontal axis. formula_11 is the contact angle of the liquid on the capillary material. Substituting these expressions leads to the first-order differential equation for
the distance the fluid penetrates into the tube formula_13:

:formula_30

===Washburn&#x27;s constant===

The Washburn constant may be included in Washburn&#x27;s equation.

It is calculated as follows:
:formula_31

=== Fluid inertia ===

In the derivation of Washburn&#x27;s equation, the inertia of the liquid is ignored as negligible. This is apparent in the dependence of length formula_1 to the square root of time, formula_33, which gives an arbitrarily large velocity &quot;dL/dt&quot; for small values of &quot;t&quot;. An improved version of Washburn&#x27;s equation, called Bosanquet equation, takes the inertia of the liquid into account.

==Applications==

===Inkjet printing===
The penetration of a liquid into the substrate flowing under its own capillary pressure can be calculated using a simplified version of Washburn&#x27;s equation:
:formula_34
where the surface tension-to-viscosity ratio formula_35 represents the speed of ink penetration into the substrate. In reality, the evaporation of solvents limits the extent of liquid penetration in a porous layer and thus, for the meaningful modelling of inkjet printing physics it is appropriate to utilise models which account for evaporation effects in limited capillary penetration.

===Food===

According to physicist and Ig Nobel prize winner Len Fisher, the Washburn equation can be extremely accurate for more complex materials including biscuits. Following an informal celebration called national biscuit dunking day, some newspaper articles quoted the equation as &quot;Fisher&#x27;s equation&quot;.

===Novel capillary pump===

The flow behaviour in traditional capillary follows the Washburn&#x27;s equation. Recently, novel capillary pumps with a constant pumping flow rate independent of the liquid viscosity were developed, which have a significant advantage over the traditional capillary pump (of which the flow behaviour is Washburn behaviour, namely the flow rate is not constant). These new concepts of capillary pump are of great potential to improve the performance of lateral flow test.

<doc id="1289913" wikidata="Q4456453" url="?curid=1289913" title="Next-bit test">
<text>In cryptography and the theory of computation, the next-bit test is a test against pseudo-random number generators. We say that a sequence of bits passes the next bit test for at any position formula_1 in the sequence, if any attacker who knows the formula_1 first bits (but not the seed) cannot predict the formula_3st with reasonable computational power.

== Precise statement(s) ==
Let formula_4 be a polynomial, and formula_5 be a collection of sets such that formula_6 contains formula_7-bit long sequences. Moreover, let formula_8 be the probability distribution of the strings in formula_6.

We now define the next-bit test in two different ways.

===Boolean circuit formulation===
A predicting collection formula_10 is a collection of boolean circuits, such that each circuit formula_11 has less than formula_12 gates and exactly formula_1 inputs. Let formula_14 be the probability that, on input the formula_1 first bits of formula_16, a string randomly selected in formula_6 with probability formula_18, the circuit correctly predicts formula_19, i.e. : 

formula_20

Now, we say that formula_21 passes the next-bit test if for any predicting collection formula_22, any polynomial formula_23 :

formula_24
===Probabilistic Turing machines===

We can also define the next-bit test in terms of probabilistic Turing machines, although this definition is somewhat stronger (see Adleman&#x27;s theorem). Let formula_25 be a probabilistic Turing machine, working in polynomial time. Let formula_26 be the probability that formula_25 predicts the formula_3st bit correctly, i.e.

formula_29

We say that collection formula_5 passes the next-bit test if for all polynomial formula_23, for all but finitely many formula_32, for all formula_33
== Completeness for Yao&#x27;s test ==

The next-bit test is a particular case of Yao&#x27;s test for random sequences, and passing it is therefore a necessary condition for passing Yao&#x27;s test. However, it has also been shown a sufficient condition by Yao.

We prove it now in the case of the probabilistic Turing machine, since Adleman has already done the work of replacing randomization with non-uniformity in his theorem. The case of Boolean circuits cannot be derived from this case (since it involves deciding potentially undecidable problems), but the proof of Adleman&#x27;s theorem can be easily adapted to the case of non-uniform Boolean circuit families.

Let formula_25 be a distinguisher for the probabilistic version of Yao&#x27;s test, i.e. a probabilistic Turing machine, running in polynomial time, such that there is a polynomial formula_23 such that for infinitely many formula_32
formula_37

Let formula_38. We have: formula_39 and formula_40. 
Then, we notice that formula_41. Therefore, at least one of the formula_42 should be no smaller than formula_43.

Next, we consider probability distributions formula_44 and formula_45 on formula_46. Distribution formula_44 is the probability distribution of choosing the formula_1 first bits in formula_6 with probability given by formula_8, and the formula_51 remaining bits uniformly at random. We have thus:

formula_52

formula_53
We thus have formula_54 (a simple calculus trick shows this), thus distributions formula_55 and formula_56 can be distinguished by formula_25. Without loss of generality, we can assume that formula_58, with formula_59 a polynomial.

This gives us a possible construction of a Turing machine solving the next-bit test: upon receiving the formula_1 first bits of a sequence, formula_61 pads this input with a guess of bit formula_62 and then formula_63 random bits, chosen with uniform probability. Then it runs formula_25, and outputs formula_62 if the result is formula_66, and formula_67 else.

<doc id="1289914" wikidata="Q7378199" url="?curid=1289914" title="Rugby League Conference">
<text>The Rugby League Conference, also known as the Co-operative Rugby League Conference as a result of sponsorship from The Co-operative Group), was a series of regionally based divisions of amateur rugby league teams spread throughout England, Scotland, and Wales.

The RLC was founded as the 10-team Southern Conference League in 1997, with teams from the southern midlands and the south east, but subsequently, rebranded and expanded both geographically and numerically to include around 90 teams stretched across almost the whole of Great Britain from Aberdeen in northern Scotland down to Plymouth on the south coast of England.

The aim of the RLC was initially to provide regular fixtures for new clubs based outside the traditional &#x27;heartland&#x27; of rugby league in the UK, although as the playing standards increased, it also accepted teams from the &#x27;heartlands&#x27;. The hope was that some clubs would eventually progress to become semi-professional.

To date, London Skolars and Coventry Bears both play in the professional structure as have Hemel Stags and Oxford although Hemel reverted to being a solely amateur club after selling its professional license to Cornwall and Oxford folded.

With the top heartlands amateur league, the National Conference League voting to move to a summer season, the 2012 season saw a re-alignment of the amateur game and the Rugby League Conference was replaced with a series of regional leagues.

==History==
The &quot;Southern Conference League&quot; was founded as a 10-team competition in 1997. The following season it was rebranded as the &quot;Rugby League Conference&quot; due to its intentions to include teams from outside the traditional heartlands of Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria.

The league steadily expanded over the first few seasons right up to the fringes of the heartlands, before expanding into Wales for the first time in 2001 with the addition of Cardiff Demons. The league expanded into the North East that same season.

In 2003 National League Three was founded including some of the stronger Rugby League Conference clubs and some BARLA clubs. This same season saw massive expansion of the Rugby League Conference including an entire Welsh division. The league also pushed its borders further including more teams from the less rugby league playing areas of the counties considered the heartlands and went as far south west as Somerset.

The league expanded further in 2004 by allowing entry to heartland clubs. For the 2005 season the competition was split into two tiers, with Premier divisions being created for above the existing regional divisions. The next major changes were in 2007 when National League Three (as the National Division) and the Scottish League became integral parts of the Rugby League Conference structure.

The Rugby League Conference celebrated passing the 100 club barrier in 2010.

2011 was the last season before the league was restructured.

<text>James Lillywhite (23 February 1842 – 25 October 1929) was an English Test cricketer and an umpire. He was the first ever captain of the English cricket team in a Test match, captaining two Tests against Australia in 1876–77, losing the first, but winning the second.

Lillywhite was born in Westhampnett in Sussex, the son of a brickmaker, John Lillywhite. In the 1861 census the 19 year old James&#x27; profession is given as Tile Maker. He was the nephew of William Lillywhite, and so cousin to William&#x27;s sons, James Lillywhite senior, John, Fred and Harry. Lillywhite is termed &quot;junior&quot; in sources to differentiate between him and his cousin James senior. He became a professional cricketer, and played first-class cricket for Sussex from 1862 and 1883. He played one final first-class match in 1885. Before the pre-Ashes Test-playing tour to Australia in 1876–77, Lillywhite also joined tours to North America in 1868 in a team led by Edgar Willsher, to Australia in 1873–74 in a team led by W.G. Grace. He also joined three further tours to Australia in teams led by Alfred Shaw, in 1881–82, 1884–85 and 1886–87.

==Test cricket==

James Lillywhite and Dave Gregory were the 1st ever Test Captains. Neither were great with the bat. Of the 2 James top scored in the 1st Test scoring 10 in the 1st Innings on 17-Mar and scored 4 in the 2nd Innings on 19 March. James, having lost the toss, had his side put into bat which meant that James was the 1st ever Test player as he led out his England side. He was 35 years 20 days old. As his team followed him out he was passed by England No: 1 Harry Jupp and England No: 8 Tom Emmett who were both 35 years old but older than James Lillywhite.

He stood as a first-class umpire between 1883 and 1901, including six Test matches. He umpired all four Test matches between Australia and England in the 1881–82 season (being partnered by John Swift in three matches and George Coulthard in the other). He was one of the organisers of Arthur Shrewsbury&#x27;s team to Australia in 1884–85 but, in spite of his experience, the Australian captain Billy Murdoch refused to allow him to umpire the first ever Test match at Adelaide. However, along with Ted Elliott, he umpired in the second Test of that series, when the entire Australian team refused to play unless they received fifty per cent of gate takings. Nine new faces appeared for Australia, and were soundly beaten. Lillywhite&#x27;s other match as umpire was the drawn fourth Test between England and Australia at Old Trafford in 1899.

He died in Chichester, the last English survivor of the first Test match.

<doc id="1289929" wikidata="Q1134392" url="?curid=1289929" title="Lethwei">
<text>Lethwei (; : ) or Burmese boxing is a full contact combat sport originating from Myanmar and is regarded as one of the most brutal martial arts in the world. Lethwei fighters are allowed to use stand-up striking techniques such as kicks, knees, elbows and punches, and the use of headbutts is also permitted. Fighters compete bareknuckle, wrapping their hands with only tape and gauze. Disallowed in most combat sports, headbutts are important weapons in a Lethwei fighter&#x27;s arsenal, giving Lethwei its name of the &quot;Art of nine limbs&quot;. This, combined with its bareknuckle nature, gave Lethwei a reputation for being one of the bloodiest and most violent martial arts. Lethwei is the last remaining sport in the world that allows headbutts. Although popular throughout Myanmar, Lethwei has been primarily and historically associated with the Karen people of the Kayin State; the vast majority of competitive Lethwei fighters are ethnolinguistically of Karen descent.

== History ==
The traditional martial arts of Myanmar are regrouped under a term called &quot;thaing&quot;, which includes bando, banshay, naban, shan gyi and Lethwei. According to researchers, thaing can be traced in its earliest form to the 12th century of the Pagan Kingdom dynasty.

In Bagan, it exists some carvings on temples and pagodas in the central Myanmar plains, which appear to show pairs of men locked in combat, suggesting the sport is potentially over a 1,000 years old.

In ancient times, matches were held for entertainment and were popular with every stratum of society. Participation was opened to any male, whether noble or commoner. At that time, matches took place in sand pits instead of rings. Boxers fought without protective equipment, only wrapping their hands in hemp or gauze. There were no draws; the fight went on until one of the participants was knocked out or could no longer continue. Back then, Burmese boxing champions would enter the ring and call for open challenges.

Lethwei went through many years of suppression during the British colonial rule of Burma. The sport was revived under General Ne Win&#x27;s nationalistic government. Unlike Muay Thai, in Lethwei, punches are generally favoured over kicks because of their ability to draw blood more easily. Traditional matches include the &quot;Flagship Tournament&quot;, which are still fought throughout Myanmar, especially during holidays or celebration festivals like Thingyan. In rural areas, having a skilled child fighter has been a way of escaping poverty.

=== The New Era ===
In modern times, the sport is kept alive in Lower Burma in Mon State and Karen State where matches are held for events such as New Year&#x27;s celebrations.

Kyar Ba Nyein, who participated in boxing at the 1952 Summer Olympics, pioneered modern Lethwei by setting in place modern rules and regulations. He travelled around Myanmar, especially the Mon and Karen states, where Lethwei is more actively practiced. After training with some of the fighters, Kyar Ba Nyein brought some to Mandalay and Yangon to compete in matches.

In 1996, the Myanmar Traditional Lethwei Federation (MTLF), a branch of the Myanmar&#x27;s Ministry of Health and Sports, added the modern Lethwei rules for the occasion of the &quot;Golden Belt Championship&quot; in Yangon. The bouts, along with the undercard fights, were organized by the Ministry of Sport, Myanmar Traditional Lethwei Federation and KSM group. This marked a big addition to the art of Lethwei and potentially would make Burmese boxing more marketable internationally.

On 18 July 2015, ONE Championship held the first Lethwei fight in its history inside a cage at the occasion of ONE Championship: Kingdom of Warriors in Yangon, Myanmar. The fight showcased Burmese fighters Phyan Thway and Soe Htet Oo in a dark match and the result was a draw according to the traditional Lethwei rules.

In 2017, ONE Championship and World Lethwei Championship officially entered into a partnership to share athletes to fight in each other&#x27;s organization. On June 30, 2017, ONE Championship held a Lethwei match at ONE Championship: Light of a Nation between Thway Thit Win Hlaing and Soe Htet Oo. Thway Thit Win Hlaing would end up winning a decision according to WLC point system.

In 2016, Myanmar&#x27;s first international Lethwei promotion called World Lethwei Championship (WLC) launched its events using the tournament Lethwei rules.

In 2019, the WLC marked history by broadcasting WLC 7: Mighty Warriors, the first Lethwei event, internationally live on UFC Fight Pass.
==== Opening to the world ====
From 7 to 12 July 2001, twelve years after Burma changed its name to Myanmar, the first international event took place in Yangon with professional fighters from the United States facing Burmese fighters under full traditional Lethwei rules. The delegation of three American fighters brought by the IKF were Shannon Ritch, Albert Ramirez and Doug Evans. Ritch faced Ei Htee Kaw, Ramirez faced Saw Thei Myo, and Evans faced openweight Lethwei champion Wan Chai. All three Americans lost to the Burmese. A revenge match with American and European fighters was cancelled the last minute by Lethwei promoters and the military in 2002.

From 10 to 11 July 2004, the second event headlining foreigners took place with four Japanese fighters fighting against Burmese fighters. They were mixed martial arts fighters Akitoshi Tamura, Yoshitaro Niimi, Takeharu Yamamoto and Naruji Wakasugi. Tamura knocked out Aya Bo Sein in the second round and became the first foreigner to beat a Myanmar Lethwei practitioner in an official match. International matches continued with the exciting Cyrus Washington vs. Tun Tun Min trilogy.

In 2016, after having previously fought to an explosive draw, Dave Leduc and Tun Tun Min rematched at the &quot;Air KBZ Aung Lan Championship&quot; in Yangon, Myanmar. The rematch was sweetened by an added bonus: ownership of the Lethwei Openweight World Championship Belt. Leduc became the first non-Burmese fighter to win the Lethwei Golden Belt and become Lethwei world champion after defeating Tun Tun Min in the third round.

Following his title defence, Leduc said in an interview, &quot;I have so much vision for this sport. I see Lethwei doing the same for Myanmar as what Muay Thai has done for Thailand.&quot;

On 18 April 2017, for his second title defense under traditional rules, Dave Leduc faced Turkish Australian challenger Adem Yilmaz at Lethwei in Japan 3: Grit in Tokyo, Japan. This marked the first Lethwei World title fight headlining two non-Burmese in the sport&#x27;s history and for the occasion, the Ambassador of Myanmar to Japan was present at the event held in the Korakuen Hall.

==== Sanctioning worldwide ====
Due to the violent ruleset, Lethwei is difficult to sanction and is illegal in most countries outside of Myanmar. Even though headbutts are allowed in Lethwei, they are banned from most other combat sports including mixed martial arts, kickboxing, and Muay Thai. As of 2022, Myanmar Lethwei is only legal in the following countries: Myanmar, Japan, Singapore, Slovakia, Austria, Thailand, Taiwan, England, United States (only the state of Wyoming), New Zealand and Poland. The World Lethwei Federation has the responsibility to sanction and support the growth of Lethwei worldwide outside of Myanmar.

== In popular culture ==
Lethwei has been featured in variety of popular culture and mass media, including written works, live-action film and television and animation in Myanmar and occasionally abroad. In 2016, the sport gained worldwide attention after Dave Leduc defeated Tun Tun Min, a Golden Belt champion. The same year, Born Warriors released a series of documentaries shot throughout Myanmar. In 2018, Frank Grillo travelled to Myanmar and featured Lethwei in the Netflix documentary &quot;FightWorld&quot;. In 2019, Lethwei was featured in The Joe Rogan Experience podcast by Joe Rogan with Leduc as guest. The sport has also been featured in the popular Japanese manga series &quot;Kengan Ashura&quot;. In the series, the Burmese Lethwei master named &quot;Saw Paing&quot;, is so indestructible that an opponent shatters every bone in their hand trying to punch him.

== Traditional gesture ==
=== Lekkha moun ===
The &quot;lekkha moun&quot; is the traditional gesture performed by Lethwei fighters to challenge their opponents with courage and respect. The lekkha moun is done by clapping 3 times with right palm to the triangle shaped hole formed while bending the left arm. The clapping hand must be in form of a cup, while the left hand must be placed under the right armpit. The lekkha moun is done at the beginning of the Lethwei yay and can also be done while fighting.

This invitation to fight is inspired from the birds of prey, like the eagle, as they flap their wings when flying and hunting.

=== Lethwei yay ===
The &quot;Lethwei yay&quot; could be described as a &quot;fight dance&quot;. It is performed before the fight as a way to showcase the fighter&#x27;s skills and as a victory dance after the fight. The lekkha moun is usually confused with the lethwei yay, but the lekkha moun is done along with the Lethwei yay.

Before modernisation, especially in colonial times, the pre-fight dance was more commonly referred to as han yay (ဟန်ရေး). Performed in accordance with the tempo of the traditional orchestra (ဆိုင်း), it incorporated a much more elaborate dance and show of skills. Boastful poetry was sometimes recited along with the dance.

=== Traditional rules ===
The traditional rules, also known as &quot;yoe yar&quot; rules, which comes from the Burmese &quot;Myanma yoe yar Latway&quot;, which means &quot;Myanmar traditional boxing&quot;. Traditional matches are still fought throughout Myanmar, especially during festivals or celebrations like Thingyan. Traditional Lethwei is notorious for not having a scoring system and for its controversial rule of knock-out only to win.

At the end of the match, in the eventuality that there is no knockout or stoppage, if the two fighters are still standing, even if one fighter dominated the fight, the match is declared a draw. Fighters can win by incapacitating their rivals in a few different ways.

* A knock-out (KO) is when a fighter falls to the ground, leans unconscious or if a fighter is unable to stand up or defend themself for 20 seconds (10 counts with 1 count every 2 seconds).

* The use of the time-out is considered as 1 count.

==== Golden Belt ====

The traditional &quot;Lethwei Golden Belt&quot; is regarded as the highest and most prestigious award for Lethwei fighters. Not to be confused with the annual &quot;Golden Belt Championship&quot;, composed mostly of younger rising talent and using the tournament rules point system. 

There is only one &quot;Golden Belt&quot; champion for each weight categories, with the openweight class champion being considered the strongest fighter in Myanmar. The openweight Golden Belt champion is the equivalent of being pound-for-pound champion in the world of Lethwei.

=== Tournament rules ===
In 1996, the Myanmar Traditional Lethwei Federation created the tournament ruleset for the inaugural Golden Belt Championship tournament. The two-minute injury timeout was removed and judges were added ringside to determine a winner in the event there was no knockout. This modified ruleset prevents the outcome of a draw and helped choose a winner to advance in the tournament. Myanmar&#x27;s first international promotion, the World Lethwei Championship, opted for this ruleset in order to follow international safety regulations and have clear winners.

Judging criteria

The knockout is still highly desired under this ruleset, but in the event that a bout goes the distance, judges will present a decision. The 3 judges should score the bout based on:

* aggression
* damage
* amount of blood drawn
* number of significant strikes per round

Fighters have a maximum of 3 knockdowns per round and 4 knockdowns in the entire fight before the fight is ruled a knockout.

== Techniques ==
Aside from punches, kicks, elbows and knee attacks, Burmese fighters also make use of head-butts, raking knuckle strikes and take downs.


=== Headbutt (&quot;Gowl Tite&quot;) ===


=== Punching (&quot;Let Thee&quot;) ===


=== Elbow (&quot;Tel Daung&quot;) ===
The elbow can be used in several ways as a striking weapon: horizontal, diagonal-upwards, diagonal-downwards, uppercut, downward, backward-spinning and flying. They can be used as either a finishing move or as a way to cut the opponent&#x27;s eyebrow to draw blood.

Elbows can be used to great effect as blocks or defenses against, for example, spring knees, side body knees, body kicks or punches. When well connected, an elbow strike can cause serious damage to the opponent, including cuts or even a knockout.

=== Kicking (&quot;Kan&quot;) ===
=== Knee (&quot;Doo&quot;) ===
=== Foot-thrust ===
The foot-thrust is one of the techniques in Lethwei. It is used as a defensive technique to control distance or block attacks and as a way to set up attack. Foot-thrusts should be thrown quickly but with enough force to knock an opponent off balance.

Note - The Myanglish spelling and phonetics based spelling are two different things. The words used are phonetics based words which are more friendly and easy to pronounce for non-Myanmar speaking people. The phonetics wording is provided by Liger Paing from United Myanmar Bando Nation.

<text>Menshikov Tower (), also known as the Church of Archangel Gabriel, is a Baroque Russian Orthodox Church in Basmanny District of Moscow, within the Boulevard Ring. The church was initially built in 1707 to order of Alexander Menshikov by Ivan Zarudny assisted by Domenico Trezzini, a team of Italian-Swiss craftsmen from Ticino and Fribourg cantons and Russian stonemasons from Kostroma and Yaroslavl. The earliest extant Petrine Baroque building in Moscow, Menshikov Tower was substantially altered in the 1770s. The church traditionally functioned in summer only; in winter the congregation assembled in nearby Church of Theodor Stratelates, built in 1782–1806. Church of Saint Theodore also provides the bells for ritual ringing: despite its height, Menshikov Tower does not have bells.

==History==

The first church in the name of Archangel Gabriel on this site was first mentioned in 1551 census records. By 1657 it was rebuilt in stone, and was extended in 1679. Twenty years later the influential statesman Alexander Menshikov consolidated parcels of land south from present-day Clean Ponds. The church of Archangel Gabriel became a house church of his estate which stood one block to the west, on the site of present-day Central Post Office. 

In 1701 Menshikov repaired the old church, but in 1704 ordered it to be demolished. Menshikov assigned overall construction management to Ivan Zarudny. Domenico Trezzini, subordinate to Zarudny, was placed in charge of European craftsmen (of Fontana, Rusco, Ferrara and other Ticino families) but after half a year was dispatched to Saint Petersburg. The new church was structurally complete by 1707; its height, 81 meters, equaled that of Ivan the Great Bell Tower. The building initially had five structural stone levels (the nave, a square lower tower and three octagonal levels; the top two octagons were built of wood). By 1708 the tower acquired 50 bells and an English chiming clock. It was crowned with a 30-meter spire with a gilded angel-shaped weather vane. Menshikov tower was Moscow&#x27;s first building richly adorned with figurative sculpture, but most of it was lost in the 18th century.

In 1710 Menshikov was appointed governor of Saint Petersburg and abandoned his Moscow projects, taking most of the craftsmen with him. Work on the tower interiors slowed down; Menshikov&#x27;s private box inside the church was rebuilt in an ordinary side altar.

In 1723 the tower was struck by lightning; the fire completely destroyed the upper wooden structure with the clockwork. The bells fell down, crushing the wooden ceilings and destroying nave interiors (still incomplete). The side altars, however, survived and continued operation while the main tower stood decapitated until 1773. In 1773–1779 the tower was restored and acquired its current shape: instead of recreating the destroyed upper octagon, the new architects replaced it with a compact but complex baroque dome. Vases on the corners of the first octagon, installed in the 1770s, replaced the statues lost in 1723 (the vases were later regularly replaced and are now made of concrete). Window arches of the octagons were filled up with brick, rendering installation of bells impossible. Otherwise, sculptural finishes of this period were close to lost originals (present-day sculpture, again, is mostly concrete replica).

Menshikov tower had no reliable heating facilities and was closed for the winters. Instead, the congregation built a smaller neoclassical church of St. Theodore Stratelates (completed 1806), which also doubled as the bell tower.

In 1821–1850s the tower was a house church of the Central Post Office. The postmasters entertained the plans to reopen the upper level windows and install the bells, but they did not materialize. The church was repaired externally, and the only significant addition was the pineapple-shaped spire which remains extant.

The church was looted in 1922 and lost its iconostasis; existing iconostasis comes from a church in Preobrazhenskoye that was demolished in the 1960s.

<text>The Penshaw Monument (officially the Earl of Durham&#x27;s Monument) is a memorial in the style of an ancient Greek temple on Penshaw Hill in the metropolitan borough of the City of Sunderland, North East England. It is located near the village of Penshaw, between the towns of Washington and Houghton-le-Spring in historic County Durham. The monument was built between 1844 and 1845 to commemorate John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham (1792–1840), Governor-General of British North America and author of the Durham Report on the future governance of the American territories. Owned by the National Trust since 1939, it is a Grade I listed structure.

The monument was designed by John and Benjamin Green and built by Thomas Pratt of Bishopwearmouth using local gritstone at a cost of around £6000; the money was raised by subscription. On 28 August 1844, while it was partially complete, its foundation stone was laid by Thomas Dundas, 2nd Earl of Zetland in a Masonic ceremony which drew tens of thousands of spectators. Based on the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, it is a tetrastyle temple of the Doric order, with eighteen columns—seven along its longer sides and four along its shorter ones—and no roof or cella (inner chamber).

One column contains a spiral staircase leading to a parapeted walkway along the entablature. This staircase was closed to the public in 1926 after a 15-year-old boy fell to his death from the top of the monument. The structure fell into disrepair in the 1930s and was fenced off, then repaired in 1939. It has since undergone further restoration, including extensive work in 1979 during which its western side was dismantled. Floodlit at night since 1988, it is often illuminated in different colours to mark special occasions. The National Trust began to offer supervised tours of the walkway in 2011.

Penshaw Monument is a local landmark, visible from up to away. It appears on the crest of Sunderland A.F.C. and is viewed nationally as a symbol of the North East. It has been praised for the grandeur, simplicity and symbolic significance of its design, especially when seen from a distance. However, critics have said it is poorly constructed and lacks purpose; nineteenth-century architectural journals condemned its lack of a roof and the hollowness of its columns and walls. It features no depiction of the man it honours, and has been widely described as a folly.

==Location==

Penshaw Monument stands on the south-western edge of the summit of Penshaw Hill, an isolated knoll formed by the erosion of an escarpment of the Durham Magnesian Limestone Plateau. The National Trust landholding at the site totals , including of deciduous woodland to the west of the monument. The woodland is split into Dawson&#x27;s Plantation in the north and Penshaw Wood in the south. Both the summit of the hill and the woodland are considered Sites of Nature Conservation Interest by Sunderland City Council.

The monument&#x27;s car park is accessible from Chester Road (the A183); three footpaths lead from the car park to the monument, which can also be reached from Grimestone Bank in the north-west and Hill Lane in the south. The National Heritage List for England gives the monument&#x27;s statutory address as Hill Lane, but Sunderland City Council lists the property as located on Chester Road. There have been few changes to the site since the monument&#x27;s construction, although signs, fences and floodlights have been added, and footpaths have been improved by the National Trust. There is an Ordnance Survey trig point to the west of the monument.

The site receives over 60,000 visitors every year; people come to visit the monument, admire the views or engage in walking, jogging or photography. The Trust has placed a geocache at the site. The Penshaw Bowl, an Easter egg rolling competition for children, takes place on the hill every Maundy Thursday; this tradition is over a century old. The hill is also popular for Bonfire Night and New Year celebrations.

The surrounding area was formerly industrialised, but is now mainly arable farmland. The site is in the Shiney Row ward; it is south-west of Sunderland, north-east of Chester-le-Street, south-east of Washington and north of Houghton-le-Spring. To the north is the Washington Wetland Centre, managed by the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust; to the south is Herrington Country Park. The monument is visible from away on a sunny day and can be seen from the A1 road; from the hill, it is sometimes possible to see the Cheviot Hills in Northumberland and the central tower of Durham Cathedral, as well as the sea.

===History of the site===
There is evidence that Penshaw Hill may have been an Iron Age hillfort: the remains of what may be ramparts have been identified at the site, and the expansive views from the hill would have made it a strategically advantageous location for a fort. In March 1644, during the First English Civil War, the hill served as an encampment for an army of Scottish Covenanters who fled there after a failed attack on Newcastle before the Battle of Boldon Hill. The hill is associated with the local legend of the Lambton Worm; a folk song written by C. M. Leumane in 1867 describes the worm wrapping itself &quot;ten times roond Pensha Hill&quot;. The hill is the site of an 18th-century limestone quarry on Dawson&#x27;s Plantation, which is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest; farming and quarrying on nearby land continued after the monument&#x27;s construction.

The landholding is on the north-eastern edge of the historical township of Penshaw; the original village of Old Penshaw is approximately from the monument. After Penshaw Colliery opened in 1792, a new pit village was established to the south-west of the original village – it was known as New Penshaw. The earliest record of Penshaw is in the Boldon Book of 1183, where it is described as being leased by William Basset from a Jordan de Escoland, later Jordan de Dalton. Other former landowners of the vill include the Bowes-Lyon and Lambton families. The land on which the monument stands was eventually passed to the Vane-Tempest-Stewart estate and became the property of Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, who gifted it as the site of the structure.

==Conception and construction==
===Background===
John George Lambton (born 1792) was the son of William Henry Lambton and Lady Anne Barbara Frances Villiers. He attended Eton College, then joined the 10th Royal Hussars in 1809. Lambton became Member of Parliament for County Durham in 1813; politically, he had a reputation for radicalism and proposing electoral reform, earning him the nickname &quot;Radical Jack&quot;. In 1828 he was raised to the peerage, becoming Baron Durham. In 1830 Durham was made Lord Privy Seal in Earl Grey&#x27;s cabinet and was charged with producing a draft of the bill that became the Reform Act 1832. He resigned his position in 1833, and was created Earl of Durham shortly afterwards. He was a Freemason and became Deputy Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1834.

The second Melbourne ministry appointed him Ambassador to Russia in 1835; he spent two years in the post. In 1838 Durham agreed to become Governor-General of British North America, and was sent to the British colony of Lower Canada (now Quebec) to deal with rebellions in the region. After a failed attempt to exile rebel leaders to Bermuda, he resigned from the post and left Canada after five months. His &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot; (1839) recommended that Lower Canada merge with the English-speaking province of Upper Canada to anglicise its French-speaking inhabitants; it also advocated limited self-government for the colony.

After an illness lasting several months, thought to be tuberculosis, he died on 28 July 1840 in Cowes, Isle of Wight. On 3 August, his body was taken in his own yacht to Sunderland, then in a steamship to Lambton Castle. His funeral took place on 10 August, and was attended by over 300 Freemasons; they wanted to perform a Masonic ceremony for the occasion, but were asked not to do so by Durham&#x27;s family. The ceremony began at the castle, where the Earl lay in state in the dining room. A procession, consisting of around 450 people in carriages and hundreds more on foot, then conveyed the body to the parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street, where Durham was buried in his family vault. A large crowd gathered to observe the procession; its size has been estimated as between 30,000 and 50,000 people. The Marquess of Londonderry, a political opponent of Durham&#x27;s, travelled from London to act as a pallbearer at the funeral.

===1840–1842: proposals and selection of the site===

At a meeting at the Lambton Arms pub in Chester-le-Street on 19 August 1840, it was decided to form a Provisional Committee to raise funds for a monument to the Earl by subscription. The next day, at the Assembly Rooms in Newcastle, a committee of 33 men was formed for that purpose; it included the mayors of Newcastle and Gateshead. The chairman of the committee was Henry John Spearman. The following motion was put forward by William Ord MP:

Around £500 () was pledged at this meeting. There were initially disagreements about the site of the monument: proposals included Durham, the Earl&#x27;s territorial designation; Chester-le-Street, his burial place; Sunderland, where he had trading connections; and Newcastle, due to its size. In a letter to the &quot;Durham Chronicle&quot;, published in October 1840, an anonymous subscriber to the monument urged that members of the public be allowed to submit designs, and that the final design be chosen by subscribers. The letter warned of a &quot;vicious system of jobbing&quot; in which the exercise of private influence led to the adoption of inferior designs, which it claimed had influenced the planning of other monuments such as Nelson&#x27;s Column.

At another meeting at the Bridge Hotel in Sunderland on 28 January 1842, William Hutt MP proposed that &quot;the monument should be of an architectural character&quot;, and suggested Penshaw Hill as a location because it was the Earl&#x27;s property, and the monument would be visible from much of County Durham and close to the East Coast Main Line. Durham&#x27;s wife had expressed support for this site before her death. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;a more suitable spot for the erection of a monument to the late lamented Earl could not have been selected&quot;. Hutt hoped to erect a statue of Durham, and read out a letter from a sculptor who had offered to make one. By this point, around £3000 () had been subscribed. More money was later raised by a London-based committee.

===1842–1843: selection of the design===
The committee sought advice from the Royal Institute of British Architects in London. Its secretary, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, advised approaching five or six skilled architects named by the Institute privately, rather than advertising publicly for designs. Donaldson told Hutt that if a public call for designs was made, the most skilled architects would not compete. The Institute surveyed Penshaw Hill and produced instructions to the architects, which described the hill and indicated subscribers&#x27; preference for a column. The instructions stated that the project could not cost more than £3000. Six of the designs submitted to the committee were exhibited at the institute&#x27;s premises in London before they were seen in the north. These were all either columns or obelisks, each topped with a statue of the Earl. At a meeting in Sunderland on 8 July 1842, subscribers examined proposals by seven architects. These were:

*John Augustus Cory—Two designs: a column in the style of Italianate architecture; and a column based on those of the Temple of Hephaestus
*Thomas Leverton Donaldson—Design unknown
*Harvey Lonsdale Elmes—Two designs: a Grecian column topped by a temple containing an urn; and a column with projecting balconies in imitation of a Roman rostral column
*Charles Fowler—A Norman column, similar to those in the nave of Durham Cathedral
*Arthur Mee—A column; details unknown
*John Buonarotti Papworth—An obelisk, with a bronze statue and sarcophagus at the front
*Robert Wallace—A Doric column, in diameter, based on those of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Agrigento and topped with a podium and a metal tripod

Some present at the meeting were unhappy that the preference for a column had been expressed—one felt that &quot;it would have been better to have left the genius of the artists unfettered&quot;, and another wished to receive more designs before a decision was made. There was some consternation that the building of the monument was not taking place as quickly as had been anticipated. The &quot;Durham Chronicle&quot; disapproved of the proposed designs, writing that &quot;a column, standing in solitary nakedness, is a palpable absurdity&quot;. It criticised the designs of Grey&#x27;s Monument and Nelson&#x27;s Column, believing them to belong to &quot;the candlestick style of monumental architecture&quot;, and wrote that the monument to the Earl of Durham should be &quot;lofty, massive, durable, and distinctive—simple in its features, and grand in its general effect&quot;.

On 8 November 1842, an executive committee with the power to choose a design and begin construction of the monument was formed in Newcastle. In May 1843, the committee met to consider new designs that it had received, and decided to recommend John and Benjamin Green&#x27;s proposal of a Grecian Doric temple to subscribers. By July, the design had been officially selected. The Greens were father and son, and also designed Grey&#x27;s Monument and the Theatre Royal in Newcastle. The initial design was in the style of the temples of Paestum, with an arrangement of four by six columns; this was later changed to one based on the Temple of Hephaestus. It was envisaged that the hill would become an enclosed pleasure garden after the monument&#x27;s construction.

===1844: construction and foundation stone ceremony===

The stone used in the construction was a gift from the Marquess of Londonderry; it came from his quarries in Penshaw, about from the hill. In a letter to subscribers, the Marquess explained his decision to provide the stone: &quot;it has afforded me great satistfaction in a very humble manner to aid in recording my admiration of [the Earl of Durham&#x27;s] talents and abilities, however I may have differed with him on public or political subjects&quot;. Lime used in the construction was made in kilns owned by the Earl of Durham, located in the nearby village of Newbottle; sand was obtained from a sand pit at the foot of Penshaw Hill. The materials were brought up the hill by a temporary spiral railway. Holes on the stone blocks of the monument&#x27;s stylobate indicate that they were transported with a lifting device called a lewis.

In January and February 1844, an invitation to tender for the monument&#x27;s construction was placed in the &quot;Durham Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Newcastle Courant&quot; newspapers. The deadline to submit tenders was initially 15 February, but was later extended to 1 March. By 15 March the builder Thomas Pratt of Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, had been awarded the contract; little is known about him. By March, operations to clear the ground at the site had begun; an invitation to tender for the transportation of the stone from the quarry to Penshaw Hill appeared in the &quot;Durham Chronicle&quot; on 29 March. By May, a trench for the monument&#x27;s foundations had been dug.

The foundation stone of the monument was laid on 28 August 1844 by Thomas Dundas, 2nd Earl of Zetland, Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England. The construction had been underway for several months: all the columns had been built to around half of their final height, except two at the front of the structure. The monument&#x27;s scaffolding was adorned with flags for the ceremony. The Great North of England Railway Company organised special trains from Sunderland, Newcastle, Durham and South Shields to bring spectators to the event, and galleries were erected on either side of the monument to allow them to watch the ceremony—most of those in the galleries were women. The &quot;Durham Chronicle&quot; estimated that between 15,000 and 20,000 spectators were present; the &quot;Durham County Advertiser&quot; reported at least 30,000.

A pavilion was put up in a field to the south of Penshaw Hill to accommodate the Freemasons present, including 400 members of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Durham. At around 1:30 pm, the Freemasons formed a procession and ascended the hill, accompanied by a marching band and the monument&#x27;s building committee. The Grand Treasurer placed a phial containing Victorian coins into a cavity in the foundation stone, which was then covered with a brass plate bearing an inscription that dedicated the monument to the Earl of Durham. Zetland then spread mortar on the stone with a silver trowel, specially engraved for the occasion. A second stone was then lowered on top of it as the band played &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;, and Zetland used a plummet, level and square to adjust the upper stone before strewing it with corn, wine and oil. The Reverend Robert Green of Newcastle said a prayer and the Freemasons examined the plans of the monument before returning to their pavilion as the band played &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; described the event thus:

That evening, two dinners were held in Sunderland to celebrate the event: one at the Wheatsheaf in Monkwearmouth and another at the Bridge Hotel. The former was attended by many of the Freemasons who had participated in the ceremony; the latter accommodated many members of the gentry. A dispute arose at one of these dinners when the vice-chairman, a Liberal solicitor called A. J. Moore, refused to take part in a toast in honour of the Marquess of Londonderry, a Tory. Moore left the room, and the toast was drunk in his absence. The &quot;Newcastle Journal&quot; condemned Moore&#x27;s behaviour as a &quot;brutal display of corrupt feeling, unmanly resentment, and base ingratitude&quot;. In September 1844, one of the monument&#x27;s architects threatened legal action against J. C. Farrow, who had announced the publication of a lithograph depicting the structure. Green claimed that the monument—which was not yet finished—could not be depicted without reference to the architectural plans, and that the lithograph infringed his &quot;rights of copy and design&quot;. The &quot;Durham Chronicle&quot; called Green&#x27;s claim &quot;utterly preposterous and absurd&quot;. In October, the &quot;Carlisle Journal&quot; reported that only one of the monument&#x27;s columns had been topped with its capital, and that the structure was expected to be completed in 1845. The total cost of the construction was approximately £6000 ().

==Subsequent history==
===1880s to 1920s: early damage and fatal accident===

On 29 May 1889, the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne was told of damage to the monument: many of the stones forming its stylobate had been removed and rolled down Penshaw Hill. The stonework was repaired in the 1920s after it became cracked.

It was once possible to pay a penny for the key to the staircase to the top of the structure. This ended after a fatal accident: on 5 April (Easter Monday) 1926, Temperley Arthur Scott, a 15-year-old apprentice mason from Fatfield, fell to his death from the top of Penshaw Monument. There were around 20 people at the top when he fell. He had ascended the structure with three of his friends; the group had climbed around the top twice and were attempting to do so a third time. Scott tried to climb over a pediment to cross between the two walkways when he stumbled and fell . A doctor pronounced him dead at the scene. A police officer told an inquest at the Primitive Methodist Chapel in Fatfield that it was usual for people to visit the top of the monument on public holidays. He said the stonework at the top of the pediment was worn, suggesting that many people had scaled it. The deputy coroner declared a verdict of accidental death and recommended either that spiked railings be put on the pediments, or that the door to the staircase be permanently locked. The door was kept locked from then on; after repeated break-ins it was sealed with cement, and later bricks.

===1930s to 1970s: National Trust restoration===

At a conference organised by the Council for the Preservation of Rural England in Leamington Spa in summer 1937, J. E. McCutcheon of Seaham Town Council spoke about the need to protect tourist destinations in County Durham. McCutcheon&#x27;s comments interested B. L. Thompson, who was attending the conference on behalf of the National Trust; the two men began corresponding. As a result, the Trust agreed to take over Penshaw Monument from John Lambton, 5th Earl of Durham on the condition that covenants be imposed on Cocken Wood, an area of woodland near Finchale Priory. The monument became the Trust&#x27;s property in September 1939. In April 1950 it was classed as a Grade I listed building on the National Heritage List for England; its official name is the Earl of Durham&#x27;s Monument. Grade I buildings make up only 2.5% of listed buildings, and are described by Historic England as &quot;of exceptional interest&quot;.

In 1936 the &quot;Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette&quot; reported that multiple large stones had fallen from the monument and a fence had been erected around it—the fence was wooden and covered in barbed wire, and was still there in 1938. By July 1939 repair work was being carried out, and scaffolding was present around some of the monument&#x27;s columns. It was not damaged during the Second World War, despite raids on Houghton-le-Spring during the Blitz. In 1942 it was struck by lightning; this caused damage to the top of the column containing the staircase. This damage—a hole at the top of the column and a fissure extending half its length—was still visible a decade later.

In 1951 the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot; reported that children had unsealed the door to the staircase and climbed the monument to search for pigeons&#x27; eggs; the National Trust employed a local builder to reseal it. In 1959 the National Coal Board repaired the monument after it was damaged by subsistence caused by mining: its northern, western and southern sides had become cracked, and part of the walkway had detached and overhung the interior. Stone blocks were replaced with concrete slabs with stone facings. Because of further settlement, Penshaw Monument was underpinned in 1978. The next year the western side was taken apart, and damaged lintels were replaced with ones made of reinforced concrete; the new lintels have buff-coloured artificial stone facings.

===1980s to 2000s: floodlighting and further repair===
In 1982 a grant from the Countryside Commission allowed the National Trust to purchase of land surrounding the monument, including much of the south-facing side of Penshaw Hill and the woodland to the north-west. The monument has been illuminated at night by floodlights since 1988, when Sunderland City Council paid £50,000 () for them. Between 1994 and 1996, several of these lights were stolen; Northumbria Police said they may have been used as grow lights for the cultivation of cannabis. In 1994, &quot;The Journal&quot; reported that Penshaw Monument &quot;might be sinking&quot; after two surveys showed the levels of the bottoms of the columns were not even. The National Trust hired the civil engineer Professor John Knapton to carry out a third, more comprehensive survey of the monument to assess whether movement had occurred.

In 1996 the National Trust said it was spending over £100,000 () to restore the monument. Its columns and lintels had deteriorated and were repaired. Its cast iron had rusted, causing them to expand and stress the monument&#x27;s stonework—these were replaced with stainless steel cramps bedded in lead. Repointing was done using lime mortar made from lime quarried at the National Trust&#x27;s pits on the Wallington estate in Northumberland. However, the surface of the stone, which has been blackened by soot, was not cleaned so that it would remain &quot;a reminder of the area&#x27;s tradition of heavy industry&quot;. The Trust later said: &quot;Now that mining has ceased, the blackness seems particularly evocative and proposals for cleaning have been resisted&quot;. On 16 November 2005 a group of 60 volunteers, recruited by the National Trust from local businesses, universities and Boldon School, South Tyneside, assisted with the upkeep of the monument by replacing the kissing gate at its entrance, building a plinth and path for its interpretation area, repairing and replacing the steps leading to it and planting of hedge.

===2010s and 2020s: reopening of the staircase and vandalism===

In August 2011 the National Trust opened the staircase to the public for the first time since 1926 and began to provide guided tours of the top of the structure. More than 500 people attended the reopening, although only 75 were initially allowed to climb it; further tours took place in subsequent months. The trust now normally provides tours every weekend between Good Friday and the end of September. Tours last 15 minutes and only five people are allowed to go up at once; National Trust members can do so for free, but non-members must pay £5. By March 2013, over 3600 people had taken the tours.

In March 2014 the council announced that it would spend £43,000 to replace the floodlights with 18 new energy-efficient LED lights, which it expected would save £8000 per year in operating costs; they produce a softer, whiter light than their predecessors, and can be programmed to illuminate the monument in different colours. They were paid for with a government loan and were expected to reduce annual energy consumption from 75,000 kilowatt-hours to less than 10,000. An archaeological watching brief was carried out during the lights&#x27; installation. In April 2015 nine of the new lights, worth £20,000, were stolen; thieves used bolt cutters to breach the monument&#x27;s security gates and open the lights&#x27; steel enclosures. The installation was fully complete by August 2015. The monument has since been illuminated in various colours to commemorate events, including the colours of the flag of France after the November 2015 Paris attacks; the colours of Hays Travel in November 2020 to commemorate John Hays; the colours of the Union Jack on 31 January 2020 to mark Brexit; and blue on 24 March 2020 as a tribute to National Health Service and social care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 26 July 2014, extensive areas of the monument were vandalised with red spray paint. The graffiti included text and symbols related to the 2005 film &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;. The National Trust said it had hired specialist contractors to remove the graffiti at a &quot;considerable cost&quot;. Although the Trust did not ask for donations, local residents and businesses gave £1500 to pay for the removal. In 2019, as an April Fools&#x27; Day joke, it was announced that Penshaw Monument would be &quot;moved stone by stone&quot; to Beamish Museum in County Durham. The museum claimed the move was due to &quot;the discovery of an infestation of a rare breed of worm in Penshaw Hill&quot;—a reference to the Lambton Worm legend. In August 2019 the National Trust received £200,000 from Highways England&#x27;s Environment Designated Fund. It said it would use the money to provide better access to the monument by replacing old timber steps with new ones made of sandstone and limestone, and improve signage at the site using information from new ground surveys. Repairs were also carried out on the monument itself, including stone repair and repointing on its stylobate. It was originally proposed to add a new spur path, and ditches at the side of the main path with soakaway pits for drainage; however, these plans were abandoned, partly because of their archaeological impact. As part of the &quot;Lumiere in Durham&quot; light festival in November 2021, the monument is to be illuminated with 140,000 separate points of light to commemorate the UK dead in the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Architecture==

Although it was intended as a memorial to the Earl of Durham, many sources describe Penshaw Monument as a folly; it features no statue or sculpture of the man it was intended to commemorate. The monument was built in the style of a temple of the Doric order. It is based on the Temple of Hephaestus, which is on the Agoraios Kolonos hill on the north-west side of the Ancient Agora of Athens. The National Trust describes it as a replica of the temple; however, according to the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot;, &quot;at best it could be said it is &#x27;slightly similar to&#x27; the Temple of Hephaestus&quot;.

It is an example of Greek Revival architecture, which is rare in the historic County Durham. The style first appeared there at country houses like Eggleston Hall; Penshaw Monument is a late example, as is Monkwearmouth Railway Station. John Martin Robinson cites the monument alongside Bowes Museum as an example of the &quot;eccentric buildings&quot; found in the county. Nikolaus Pevsner noted that the structure&#x27;s proximity to the Victoria Viaduct produces a rare juxtaposition of Greek and Roman architecture. A booklet produced by Tyne and Wear County Council Museums compares Penshaw Monument to Jesmond Old Cemetery, whose gates were designed by John Dobson; it says that the monument &quot;shares the Arcadian intentions of Dobson&#x27;s Cemetery, but is very much more successful&quot;. In her survey of the monument commissioned by the National Trust, Penny Middleton states that its &quot;closest architectural and cultural relation&quot; may be the National Monument of Scotland, an unfinished Grecian temple on Calton Hill in Edinburgh.

===Description===
Penshaw Monument is long, wide and high, making it the biggest structure serving only as a memorial in North East England. It is made of gritstone ashlar, which was yellow at first, but has darkened. The stone was originally held together by steel pins and brackets. Graffiti is present on many areas of the monument, in the form of both carvings and ink. Its foundations originally sat on limestone below the ground. The base consists of the upper stylobate and the lower stereobate—the columns sit on the stylobate, which is made of large gritstone blocks. The height of the base varies from at the south-west corner to at the south-east. When the monument was built there were no steps leading up to the stylobate. The floor consists of setts, which are pointed in mortar and laid to falls to diagonal flagstones. These flagstones direct rainwater to a central gulley.

The monument is a tetrastyle structure. It has 18 tapered, unfluted columns: seven along the north- and south-facing sides and four facing the east and west. The columns are in diameter, and high. There are two parapeted walkways running from east to west at the top of the monument; the parapets are tall. One column—the second from the east on the south-facing side—contains a 74-step spiral staircase leading to the southern walkway. The columns support a deep entablature, whose serves as the walkways; the columns, and the walls of the foundation and entablature, are hollow. The entablature is made up of the architrave, frieze and cornice; the architrave and cornice are simple in design, and the frieze is adorned with triglyphs, although these are stylised and lack grooves. There is a triangular pediment at each end of the entablature; the total height of the entablature and pediments is .

The structure has no roof, leading &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; to call it hypaethral; however, &quot;The Civil Engineer and Architect&#x27;s Journal&quot; considered this adjective inappropriate. It asserted that &quot;[a]n &#x27;hypoethral&#x27; temple does not mean one without any roof at all... but only that peculiar kind of temple in which the &quot;cella&quot; was left partly uncovered&quot;—the monument has no cella. &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; called it &quot;not only hypaethral, but hypaethral &quot;in issimo&quot;—and after the most extraordinary fashion&quot;, and remarked, &quot;Possibly it was at first intended that there should be a roof, but in order to save expense, it was afterwards thought that such covering might be dispensed with&quot;. According to the council, the monument was indeed originally intended to have a roof and interior walls but these were never built due to a lack of funding. However, &quot;The Chronicle&quot; has reported that this is a myth and a roof was never planned.

==Reception and impact==
===19th century===

Before its completion, the &quot;Carlisle Journal&quot; said Penshaw Monument would be &quot;one of England&#x27;s proudest architectural wonders, and a fitting memorial of one of its wisest statesmen&quot;. However, its design initially met with a hostile response in architectural circles: in 1844 &quot;The Civil Engineer and Architect&#x27;s Journal&quot; called it &quot;as arrant a piece of &#x27;nonsense architecture&#x27; as can well be imagined&quot; and derisively compared it to a cattle pound. &quot;The Art Union&quot; was similarly scathing: it was critical of the idea of a Greek temple, which it said &quot;does not bespeak much of either invention or judgement&quot;. It concluded: &quot;To us it appears to be one of the most absurd, ill-imagined, and ill-contrived things ever devised, utterly devoid of significancy, purpose, or meaning.&quot;

&quot;The Civil Engineer and Architect&#x27;s Journal&quot; termed the presence of pediments despite the absence of a roof a &quot;gross and palpable violation of meaning and common sense&quot;. &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; was similarly critical of the roofless pediments—&quot;the building will look as if there had originally been a roof to it, which had fallen in!&quot;—and expressed disapproval of the lack of cella and inner walls, writing that the architects had &quot;cut the Gordian knot&quot; by omitting them. The decision to make the walls and columns hollow was condemned by &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, which called the structure &quot;nearly as much a sham, as if it were composed of cast iron coloured in imitation of stone&quot; and said it &quot;may be intended as characteristic... of an age which estimates plausible appearances above solid worth&quot;. &quot;The Art Union&quot; agreed: the hollowness of the columns, it said, &quot;partakes too much of sham construction, with little if any thing to recommend it on the score of economy&quot;.

&quot;The Athenaeum&quot; wrote that climbing the monument&#x27;s stairs could be dangerous, and &quot;The Art Union&quot; condemned the staircase as &quot;dreadfully narrow and inconvenient&quot;. &quot;The Civil Engineer and Architect&#x27;s Journal&quot; believed that those who ascended the monument would &quot;have to promenade somewhat after the fashion of crows in a gutter&quot;, and suggested that the architects ought to have provided a terrace on the roof of the monument, accessible by a wider staircase. &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; expressed confusion at the absence of a statue or commemoration of the Earl of Durham, believing that &quot;although it may not yet be definitely settled what it is to be, something must surely be intended&quot;.

In 1850 &quot;The Times&quot; was more complimentary: &quot;The position and architecture of this structure are both extremely fine, and viewed from the railway it produces the best effect.&quot; At the Great Exhibition, which took place in the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London in 1851, a model of the monument made of cannel coal was exhibited as part of the event&#x27;s Mining and Metallurgy section. In 1857 William Fordyce wrote: &quot;The temple is remarkable for its grandeur, simplicity and imposing effect, nothing in the shape of ornament or meretricious decoration being introduced&quot;. In his graphic novel &quot;Alice in Sunderland&quot;, which explores Lewis Carroll&#x27;s connections to Sunderland, Bryan Talbot suggests that Carroll may have been inspired by the monument, comparing the door leading to the monument&#x27;s stairs to a scene omitted from &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865), in which Alice knocks on a door in a tree. In his 1887 story &quot;The Flower of Weardale&quot;, author William Delisle Hay described the monument:

===20th and 21st centuries===

The monument is often described by recent sources as a landmark which indicates to locals that they have returned home after a long journey; it is no longer widely associated with John Lambton. It is a key part of Sunderland&#x27;s cultural identity, frequently depicted by local photographers and artists. Nationally, it is viewed as a symbol of the North East alongside the bridges of the River Tyne and the Angel of the North. Sunderland A.F.C.&#x27;s current crest, adopted in 1997, features a depiction of Penshaw Monument; according to Bob Murray, the club&#x27;s chairman at the time, it was included &quot;to acknowledge the depth of support for the team outside the City boundaries&quot;.

In 2006 the monument featured alongside Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the Sage Gateshead in a television advertisement for the &quot;Passionate People, Passionate Places&quot; campaign, which was intended to promote North East England. It was produced by RSA Films, a company founded by the directors Tony and Ridley Scott, both natives of the North East. In 2007 the structure came second in a poll of places which inspired the most pride in residents of the region, behind Durham Cathedral and Castle; in a survey conducted by the advertising company CBS Outdoor, 59% of people from Sunderland said Penshaw Monument was an important landmark. It appears in Richard T. Kelly&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Crusaders&quot;. The National Trust has said that since it reopened the structure&#x27;s staircase in 2011, &quot;for some making it to the top has become a sort of personal pilgrimage, with many visitors finding it an inspiring and often quite emotional experience&quot;.

Bryan Ferry, lead singer of the band Roxy Music, grew up in Washington, and often visited Penshaw Hill with his father. He told &quot;The Times&quot; that the monument made a significant impression on him as a child, and seemed &quot;like a symbol... representing art, and another life, away from the coal fields and the hard Northeastern environment; it seemed to represent something from another civilization, that was much finer&quot;. He has conceded, however, that the monument is &quot;essentially a folly, a building without purpose&quot;. In his book on Roxy Music, Michael Bracewell describes the experience of approaching the monument: &quot;its immensity drawing nearer, the heroic ideal of the place falls away. Grandeur gives way to mere enormity, statement to silence, substance to emptiness... [T]his solid memorial... was designed, like stage scenery, to be appreciated from a distance.&quot; 
Alan Robson called the monument &quot;a striking example of Doric architecture&quot; in an article for the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; James Wilson thought it &quot;perplexing&quot; and a &quot;seriously silly folly&quot;. &quot;The Journal&quot; Tony Jones called it &quot;a visible but under-rated symbol of regional identity&quot;. David Brandon described it in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as an &quot;extraordinary... symbol of the Earl of Durham&#x27;s insanity and county pride&quot;. &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; Chris Lloyd compared Penshaw Monument to the Angel of the North, calling both &quot;beautifully pointless&quot;. Tony Henderson, also of &quot;The Journal&quot;, wrote that the lack of roof and interior walls &quot;has been to the advantage of the monument as it allows the dramatic play of light among the columns&quot;. In her &quot;Monument Guide to England and Wales&quot;, Jo Darke called the monument &quot;a great northern landmark&quot;; architectural historians Gwyn Headley and Wim Meulenkamp have described its blackened surface as &quot;a satanic response to the pure white Hellenic ideal&quot;. Nikolaus Pevsner wrote that &quot;the monument looms as an apparition of the Acropolis under hyperborian skies&quot;. In his book &quot;The Northumbrians&quot;, historian Dan Jackson praised it: &quot;It is a building of great gravitas, and its austere Doric silhouette dominates the landscape for miles around.&quot;

<doc id="1289941" wikidata="Q310896" url="?curid=1289941" title="Niko Pirosmani">
<text>Nikoláy Aslánovich Pirosmanashvíli () or Niko Pirosmani (), simply referred to as Nikala (ნიკალა &quot;Nik’ala&quot;; 1862–1918), was a Georgian painter who posthumously rose to prominence. Relatively poor for most of his life, he worked a variety of ordinary jobs. His rustic, everyday scenes are celebrated today for their depiction of the Georgia of Pirosmani&#x27;s lifetime, and he has become one of the country&#x27;s most beloved artistic figures.

Niko Pirosmani is alleged to be the inspiration for the male protagonist portrayed in the Russian song Million Roses.

==Biography==
Pirosmani was born in the Georgian village of Mirzaani to a peasant family in modern-day Kakheti province. His parents, Aslan Pirosmanashvili and Tekle Toklikishvili, were farmers, who owned a small vineyard, with a few cows and oxen. He was later orphaned and left in the care of his two elder sisters, Mariam and Pepe. He moved with them to Tbilisi in 1870. In 1872, while living in a little apartment not far from Tbilisi railway station, he worked as a servant to wealthy families and learned to read and write Russian and Georgian. In 1876, he returned to Mirzaani and worked as a herdsman.

Pirosmani gradually taught himself to paint. One of his specialties was painting directly into black oilcloth. In 1882, with self-taught George Zaziashvili, he opened a painting workshop, where they made signboards. In 1890, he worked as a railroad conductor. In 1893, he co-founded a dairy farm in Tbilisi, which he left in 1901. Throughout his life, Pirosmani, who was poor, was willing to take ordinary jobs including housepainting and whitewashing buildings. He also worked for shopkeepers in Tbilisi, creating signboards, paintings, and portraits, according to their orders. Although his paintings had some local popularity (about 200 survive) his relationship with professional artists remained uneasy; making a living was always more important to him than aesthetic abstractions.

In April 1918, he died in the 1918 flu pandemic as a result of malnutrition and liver failure. He was buried at the Nino cemetery; the exact location was not registered and is unknown.

==Work==

Pirosmani&#x27;s paintings were influenced by the social conditions of his time and place. There are many works about merchants, shopkeepers, workmen, and noblemen groups. Pirosmani was fond of nature and rural life. He rarely employed city landscapes. He made many animal paintings. He was the only Georgian animalist. Pirosmani also was attracted by historical figures and themes such as Shota Rustaveli, King Tamar, Giorgi Saakadze, as well as ordinary Georgian people and their everyday lives.

Usually, Pirosmani painted on oilcloth. Unlike other artists, Niko didn&#x27;t aim at a pure imitation of the nature and paid no attention to details. Some of his paintings are monochrome. His paintings demonstrate the author&#x27;s sharp compositional consideration. Placements of the figures are frontal, while faces do not demonstrate a specific mood.

In the 1910s, he won the enthusiasm of the Russian poet Mikhail Le-Dantyu and the artist Kirill Zdanevich and his brother Ilia Zdanevich. Ilia Zhdanevich wrote a letter about Pirosmani to the newspaper &quot;Zakavkazskaia Rech&quot;, which it published on February 13, 1913. He undertook to publicise Pirosmani&#x27;s painting in Moscow. The Moscow newspaper &quot;Moskovskaia Gazeta&quot; of 7 January wrote about the exhibition &quot;Mishen&quot; where self-taught painters exhibited, among them four works by Pirosmani: &quot;Portrait of Zhdanevich&quot;, &quot;Still Life&quot;, &quot;Woman with a Beer Mug&quot;, and &quot;The Roe&quot;. Critics writing later in the same newspaper were impressed with his talent.

In the same year, an article about Niko Pirosmani and his art was published in Georgian newspaper &quot;Temi&quot;.

The Society of Georgian Painters, founded in 1916 by Dito Shevardnadze, invited Pirosmani to its meetings and began to take him up, but his relations with the society were always uneasy. He presented his painting &quot;Georgian Wedding&quot; to the Society. One of the members published a caricature of him, which greatly offended him. His continuing poverty, compounded by the economic problems caused by the First World War, meant that his life ended with his work little recognised.

==Posthumous reputation==
After his death, Pirosmani gained international reputation when he became admired as a &#x27;naïve&#x27; painter in Paris and elsewhere. His paintings were represented at the first big exhibition of Georgian painters in 1918. From 1920 onwards, a number of articles were published about him. The first monograph on Pirosmani was published in 1926 in Georgian, Russian, and French.

Interest in Pirosmani increased in the 1950s.

In 1969, a film about him was made, titled &quot;Pirosmani&quot;. He inspired a portrait sketch by Pablo Picasso (1972). Pirosmani is also depicted on a Georgian lari bill (although this bill is rarely seen in circulation today, since 1 lari coins are far more common). A periodic newspaper titled &quot;Pirosmani&quot; is published in two languages in Istanbul. In 1983 Edward Kuznetsov produced the first catalogue raisonné on Pirosmani&#x27;s work, entitled &quot;Niko Pirosmani, 1862-1918&quot;.

Exhibitions of his work have been held in Kyiv (1931), Warsaw (1968), Paris (The Louvre) (1969), Vienna (1969), Nice and Marseilles (1983), Tokyo (1986), Zurich (1995), Nantes (1999), Turin (2002), Kyiv, Istanbul (2008), Minsk, Vézelay and Vilnius (2008–2009), Vienna again (2018–19) and Basel (Foundation Beyeler) (2023–2024).

Today, 146 of his works are shown in the Art Museum of Georgia and sixteen paintings are exhibited in the Historical-Ethnographic Museum of Sighnaghi. Works by Pirosmanashvíli are part of the Zander Collection in Cologne. A monument was installed in Tbilisi. There is also the Niko Pirosmanashvili Museum in Mirzaani, Georgia, in one of his abodes.

==Recent discoveries==
In March 2011, it was discovered that the writing on the door of Qvrivishvilebi&#x27;s wine-cellar in Ozaani was made by Pirosmani. On 31 May 2011, during an investigation, experts discovered a painting, which proved to be &quot;Wounded Soldier&quot; by Pirosmani. The painting was given to the National Gallery of Georgia.

<doc id="1289944" wikidata="Q853887" url="?curid=1289944" title="Metal-halide lamp">
<text>A metal-halide lamp is an electrical lamp that produces light by an electric arc through a gaseous mixture of vaporized mercury and metal halides (compounds of metals with bromine or iodine). It is a type of high-intensity discharge (HID) gas discharge lamp. Developed in the 1960s, they are similar to mercury vapor lamps, but contain additional metal halide compounds in the quartz arc tube, which improve the efficiency and color rendition of the light.
The most common metal halide compound used is sodium iodide. Once the arc tube reaches its running temperature, the sodium dissociates from the iodine, adding orange and reds to the lamp&#x27;s spectrum from the sodium D line as the metal ionizes.
As a result, metal-halide lamps have high luminous efficacy of around 75–100 lumens per watt, which is about twice that of mercury vapor lights and 3 to 5 times that of incandescent lights and produce an intense white light. Lamp life is 6,000 to 15,000 hours. As one of the most efficient sources of high CRI white light, metal halides were the fastest growing segment of the lighting industry. They are used for wide area overhead lighting of commercial, industrial, and public places, such as parking lots, sports arenas, factories, and retail stores, as well as residential security lighting, automotive headlamps (Often generically known as &quot;xenon headlights&quot;) and indoor cannabis grow operations.

The lamps consist of a small fused quartz or ceramic arc tube which contains the gases and the arc, enclosed inside a larger glass bulb (Or quartz bulb with a coating to filter out the ultraviolet light produced in the case of compact lamps). They operate at a pressure between 4 and 20 atmospheres, and require special fixtures to operate safely, as well as an electrical ballast. Metal atoms produce most of the light output. They require a warm-up period of several minutes to reach full light output.

==Uses==
Metal-halide lamps are used for general lighting purposes both indoors and outdoors, such as commercial, industrial, and public spaces, parking lots, sports arenas, factories, and retail stores, as well as residential security lighting; automotive and specialty applications are further fields of usage. 
Metal-halide lamps are used in automobile headlights, where they are commonly generically called &quot;xenon headlamps&quot; due to the use of xenon gas in the bulb, to provide minimal light upon turning on before the lamp warms up, instead of the argon typically used in other halide lamps.

Another widespread use for such lamps is in photographic lighting and stage lighting fixtures, where they are commonly generically known as MSD or HMI lamps and are generally used in 150, 250, 400, 575 and 1,200 watt ratings, especially intelligent lighting.

Because of their wide spectrum and good efficiency they were used for indoor growing applications, specifically cannabis, and were quite popular with reef aquarists who needed a high intensity light source for their corals. However LEDs have almost entirely replaced metal halide in both applications, with just a handful of purists still holding on.

==Operation==
Like other gas-discharge lamps such as the very-similar mercury-vapor lamps, metal-halide lamps produce light by ionizing a mixture of gases in an electric arc. In a metal-halide lamp, the compact arc tube contains a mixture of argon or xenon, mercury, and a variety of metal halides, such as sodium iodide and scandium iodide. The particular mixture of metal halides influences the correlated color temperature and intensity (making the light more blue or red, for example). When started, the argon gas in the lamp is ionized first, which helps to maintain the arc across the two electrodes with the applied starting voltage. The heat generated by the arc and electrodes then ionizes the mercury and metal halides into a plasma, which produces an increasingly brighter white light as the temperature and pressure increases to operating conditions.

The arc-tube operates at anywhere from 5–50 atm or more (70–700 psi or 500–5000 kPa) and 1000–3000 °C. Like all other gas-discharge lamps, metal-halide lamps have negative resistance (with the rare exception of self-ballasted lamps with a filament), and so require a ballast to provide proper starting and operating voltages while regulating the current flow through the lamp. About 24% of the energy used by metal-halide lamps produces light (an efficacy of 65–115 lm/W), making them substantially more efficient than incandescent bulbs, which typically have efficiencies in the range 2–4%.

==Components==

Metal-halide lamps consist of an arc tube with electrodes, an outer bulb, and a base.

===Arc tube===
Inside the fused quartz &quot;arc tube&quot;, two tungsten electrodes doped with thorium are sealed into each end and an AC voltage is applied to them through molybdenum foil seals fused in silica. It is the arc between the two electrodes where the light is actually created.

Besides mercury vapor, the lamp contains iodides or bromides of different metals. Iodine and bromine are of the halogen group of the periodic table, and so are termed &quot;halides&quot; when ionized. Scandium and sodium are also used in some types, with thallium, indium, and sodium in European &quot;Tri-Salt&quot; models. Dysprosium used for high color temperature and tin for lower color temperature. Holmium and thulium are used in very high power movie lighting models and in daylight colored metal halide lamps for area floodlighting, compact low wattage metal halide lamps, as well as stadium lighting in Europe. Gallium or lead are used in special high UV-A models for printing purposes. The mixture of the metals used defines the color of the lamp. Some types, for festive or theatrical effect, use almost pure iodides of thallium, for green lamps, and indium, for blue lamps. An alkali metal, (sodium or potassium), is almost always added to reduce the arc impedance, allowing the arc tube to be made sufficiently long and simple electrical ballasts to be used. A noble gas, usually argon, is cold filled into the arc tube at a pressure of about 2 kPa to facilitate starting of the discharge. Argon filled lamps are typically quite slow to start up, taking several minutes to reach full light intensity; xenon fill, as used in automotive headlamps, start up relatively faster.

The ends of the arc tube are often externally coated with white infrared–reflective zirconium silicate or zirconium oxide to reflect heat back onto the electrodes to keep them hot and thermionically emitting. Some bulbs have a phosphor coating on the inner side of the outer bulb to improve the spectrum and diffuse the light.

In the mid-1980s a new type of metal-halide lamp was developed, which, instead of a quartz (fused silica) arc tube as used in mercury vapor lamps and previous metal-halide lamp designs, use a sintered alumina arc tube similar to those used in the high pressure sodium lamp. This development reduces the effects of ion creep that plagues fused silica arc tubes. During their life, sodium and other elements tend to migrate into the quartz tube and because of high UV radiation and gas ionization, will result in erosion of the electrodes therefore causing cycling of the lamp. The sintered alumina arc tube does not allow the ions to creep through, maintaining a more constant color over the life of the lamp. These are usually referred as ceramic metal-halide lamps or CMH lamps.

The concept of adding metallic iodides for spectral modification (specifically: sodium - yellow, lithium - red, indium - blue, potassium and rubidium - deep red, and thallium - green) of a mercury arc discharge to create the first metal-halide lamp can be traced to patent US1025932 in 1912 by Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the &quot;Wizard of General Electric&quot;.

The amount of mercury used has lessened over years of progress.

===Outer bulb===
Most types are fitted with an outer glass bulb to protect the inner components and prevent heat loss. The outer bulb can
also be used to block some or all of the UV light generated by the mercury vapor discharge, and can be composed of specially doped &quot;UV stop&quot; fused silica. Ultraviolet protection is commonly employed in single ended (single base) models and double ended models that provide illumination for nearby human use. Some high-powered models, particularly the lead-gallium UV printing models and models used for some types of sports stadium lighting do not have an outer bulb. The use of a bare arc tube can allow transmission of UV or precise positioning within the optical system of a luminaire. The cover glass of the luminaire can be used to block the UV, and can also protect people or equipment if the lamp should fail by exploding.

===Base===
Some types have an Edison screw metal base, for various power ratings between 10 and 18,000 watts. Other types are double-ended, as depicted above, with R7s-24 bases composed of ceramic, along with metal connections between the interior of the arc tube and the exterior. These are made of various alloys (such as iron-cobalt-nickel) that have a thermal coefficient of expansion that matches that of the arc tube.

===Ballasts===

The electric arc in metal-halide lamps, as in all gas discharge lamps has a negative resistance property; meaning that as the current through the bulb increases, the voltage across it decreases. If the bulb is powered from a constant voltage source such as directly from the AC wiring, the current will increase until the bulb destroys itself; therefore, halide bulbs require electrical ballasts to limit the arc&#x27;s current. There are two types: 
#&quot;Inductive ballast&quot; - Many fixtures use an inductive ballast, also known as a magnetic ballast, similar to those used with fluorescent lamps. This consists of an iron-core inductor. The inductor presents an impedance to AC current. If the current through the lamp increases, the inductor reduces the voltage to keep the current limited.
#&quot;Electronic ballast&quot; - These are lighter and more compact. They consist of an electronic oscillator which generates high frequency which is then converted to a low frequency square wave current to drive the lamp. Because they have lower resistive losses than an inductive ballast, they are more energy efficient. However, high-frequency operation does not increase lamp efficiency as for fluorescent lamps. It may cause acoustic resonance in the arc, shortening the lamp life.

Pulse-start metal-halide bulbs don&#x27;t contain a starting electrode which strikes the arc, and require an ignitor to generate a high-voltage (1–5 kV on cold strike, over 30 kV on hot restrike) pulse to start the arc. Electronic ballasts include the igniter circuit in one package. American National Standards Institute (ANSI) lamp-ballast system standards establish parameters for all metal-halide components (with the exception of some newer products).

==Color temperature==

Because of the whiter and more natural light generated, metal-halide lamps were initially preferred to the bluish mercury vapor lamps. With the introduction of specialized metal-halide mixtures, metal-halide lamps are now available with a correlated color temperature from 3,000 K to over 20,000 K. Color temperature can vary slightly from lamp to lamp, and this effect is noticeable in places where many lamps are used. Because the lamp&#x27;s color characteristics tend to change during lamp&#x27;s life, color is measured after the bulb has been burned for 100 hours (seasoned) according to ANSI standards. Pulse start metal halide lamps have improved color rendering and provided a more controlled kelvin variance (±100 to 200 kelvins) because of better arctube shapes compared to probe start metal halide lamp, which don&#x27;t requires a starting electrode to be present and allow higher pressure and temperature of the halides.

The color temperature of a metal-halide lamp can also be affected by the electrical characteristics of the electrical system powering the bulb and manufacturing variances in the bulb itself. If a metal-halide bulb is underpowered, because of the lower operating temperature, its light output will be bluish because of the evaporation of mercury alone. This phenomenon can be seen during warmup, when the arc tube has not yet reached full operating temperature and the halides have not fully vaporized. It is also very apparent with dimming ballasts. The inverse is true for an overpowered bulb, but this condition can be hazardous, leading possibly to arc-tube explosion because of overheating and overpressure.

==Starting and warm up==

A cold metal-halide lamp cannot immediately begin producing its full light capacity because the temperature and pressure in the inner arc chamber require time to reach full operating levels. Starting the initial argon arc (or xenon in automotive) sometimes takes a few seconds, and the warm up period can be as long as five minutes (depending upon lamp type). During this time the lamp exhibits different colors as the various metal halides vaporize in the arc chamber.

If power is interrupted, the lamp&#x27;s arc will extinguish, and the high pressure that exists in the hot arc tube will prevent restriking the arc; with a normal ignitor a cool-down period of 5–10 minutes will be required before the lamp can be restarted, but with special ignitors and specially designed lamps, the arc can be immediately re-established. On fixtures without instant restrike capability, a momentary loss of power can mean no light for several minutes. For safety reasons, some metal-halide fixtures have a backup tungsten-halogen incandescent lamp that operates during cool-down and restrike. Once the metal halide restrikes and warms up, the incandescent safety light is switched off. A warm lamp also tends to take more time to reach its full brightness than a lamp that is started completely cold.

Most hanging ceiling lamps tend to be passively cooled, with a combined ballast and lamp fixture.

==End of life behaviour==

Metal halide lamps, usually lose their output or change color due to the loss of halides and arctube blackening. They stop working at the end of life that is similar to mercury lamps. In rare cases, they can also cycle on/off. Some can exhibit major color shift, and in rare cases, explode.

===Risk of lamp explosion===

All metal halide arc tubes deteriorate in strength over their lifetime due to chemical attack, thermal stress and mechanical vibration. As the lamp ages the arc tube becomes discolored (often obtaining a dark grey shade), absorbing light and getting hotter. The tube will continue to become weaker until it eventually fails, causing the breakup of the tube.

Early failure of the arc tube may occur due to manufacturing defects. Manufacturers may &quot;season&quot; new lamps to check for such defects before sale.

Since a metal-halide lamp contains gases at a significant high pressure (up to 3.4 atmospheres), failure of the arc tube is inevitably a violent event. Fragments of arc tube will break the outer bulb, and hot glass fragments may fall on people or objects below. Hot fragments may present a fire hazard. Fixtures are designed to contain hot fragments with a hard glass cover, or may be designed for lamps with a quartz tube surrounding the arc tube to prevent breakage.

Shattering of the arc tube may be avoided by replacing the lamp if there is an excessive blackening of the arc tube, the arc tube begins to swell, there is a sudden changing of the light color, or the lamp begins to cycle on and off.

<doc id="1289945" wikidata="Q6026468" url="?curid=1289945" title="Indoor percussion ensemble">
<text>An indoor percussion ensemble or indoor drumline is a type of marching ensemble consisting of battery and front ensemble instruments. It differs itself from a traditional percussion ensemble by not only on musical performance, but on theatrics and marching. Although most indoor percussion ensembles are affiliated with high schools (also known as scholastic groups), there are also many independent groups that draw participants from a large area and are independently funded. Independent groups typically start rehearsing in October, while high school groups typically start after their fall marching band season ends. Because of this, the activity is often called winter percussion or winterline.

== History ==
The athletic arts were looking for a sport that could challenge and excite skilled musicians, so they started creating their own styles all over the world. Since then, marching percussion has advanced and moved into auditoriums and gymnasiums as percussion ensembles looked for ways to maintain their skills during the winter months when performing outdoors on football fields was not practical. Following in the footsteps of indoor guard ensembles, indoor percussion ensembles arrange music and motion appropriate for a more intimate setting. The activity is enjoyed throughout the United States and Japan, as Winter Guard International (WGI) provides many regional and national opportunities to compete. Percussion ensembles first appeared in WGI shows in 1992, and the theatrics, sets, and music selection has advanced throughout the activity&#x27;s history. There are many organizations unaffiliated with WGI that hold smaller regional shows all over the world.

As the number of ensembles that competed in WGI competitions grew, different skill level divisions ranging from A class to World class.

Competition became international when Color Guard Netherlands (CGN) introduced indoor percussion in Europe. In 2008 CGN hosted the first WGI Regional for percussion outside of North America. Since then, WGI has expanded even further to parts of Asia and Africa.

== Music ==

Music is arranged based on original works as well as recreations of movie themes, popular music, classical music, and more. Instrumentation is anything that would or could be used under the percussion category of any musical group. This includes instruments such as snare drums, tenors, bass drums, cymbals, xylophones, marimbas, vibraphones, tambourines, chimes, timpani, drum kits, and other similar instruments. Electronic instruments such as guitars, bass guitars, theremins, and synthesizers are also allowed in most competitive circuits. Some groups will also use prerecorded sound samples such as a short jingle or a cappella singing which is typically accompanied by the front ensemble. Spoken word via microphone or a recording on a sampler is used on occasion as well. In many cases, percussion groups will use unconventional instruments including trash cans, barrels, pipes, brooms, and other objects to output desired sound effects.

== Concert vs. marching ==

There are two types of indoor percussion ensembles. A concert percussion group consists of only a front ensemble. With these groups there is very little movement other than the motion needed for playing the instruments. The other type of indoor percussion group is known as marching percussion. These groups also include a front ensemble but add a marching ensemble for more movement. The marching ensembles have a much more visual aspect to their performances which includes marching, visual theatrics, and much more depending on the show theme.

== Marching ==
A notable difference with marching in indoor percussion is the use of toe-down marching instead of roll stepping. Marching within indoor percussion is much more fluid in contrast with corps style marching. Due to the fact that the activity is being performed in a gymnasium means the performers are closer to the audience and requires a more fluid approach to convey the type of energy needed for a more personal performer-crowd interaction. Since each group has their own tarp with a specific design, called a floor, most groups use some type of grid to set their positions, or dots. The ensemble member is also required to &#x27;guide&#x27; to the others, meaning to use the other marchers as a reference point and keep with formation using peripheral vision. Indoor ensembles may even incorporate dance moves and choreography into their shows for a more dramatic effect.

== Set designs ==

Depending on the financial situation and the creativity of the design team, sets can be created to help the audience engage the performance to a greater depth. Painted floor coverings and backdrops are used to portray a story as the group performs the music in and around the props. Most upper-level groups have large nylon-vinyl tarps that cover an entire gym floor.

Sets must also be designed to function within the space provided. If a performance is in a gym, the materials must be able to enter the gym. If the performance is in a stadium type gym, then doors and openings are easier to access.

There are strict rules on the area sets that can be placed on and the time a group is allowed to set them up. Violations of these rules result in score deductions.

==Uniforms==
At first, indoor percussion ensembles wore traditional marching band uniforms. As shows and concepts increased in detail, uniforms were left behind, and theatrical costumes took their place. Uniforms could be as simple as jeans and T-shirts for a rendition of &quot;West Side Story&quot; or as complicated as special jumpsuits with chains and feathers to portray a show like Cirque Du Soleil, though many groups use more modern uniforms.

== Winter marching ensembles ==
A more recent development in the indoor percussion ensemble genre has been the introduction of mixed-group ensembles, combining winter guard with indoor percussion ensembles, sometimes referred to as winter marching ensemble.

<text>Randy Craig Wolfe (February 20, 1951 – January 2, 1997), known as Randy California, was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter, and one of the original members of the rock group Spirit, formed in 1967.

==Life and career==
California was born Randy Craig Wolfe to Robert Wolfe and Bernice Wolfe (née Pearl) and grew up in a musical Jewish family in Los Angeles. He spent his early years studying varied styles at the family&#x27;s Los Angeles folk club, the Ash Grove, which was founded by his uncle, Ed Pearl. He was 15 years old when his mother and new stepfather, Ed Cassidy (later to become a founding member of the band Spirit, with Randy), moved to New York City in the summer of 1966 because Cassidy had a number of jazz gigs lined up. It was there, at Manny&#x27;s Music, that he met Jimi Hendrix.

He played in Hendrix&#x27;s band Jimmy James and the Blue Flames that summer. California, Cassidy and Pearl lived in an apartment building in Forest Hills, Queens called the Balfour, whose other residents included future Steely Dan co-founder Walter Becker, who cited California&#x27;s blues-based guitar style as an influence on his own playing.

The stage name &quot;Randy California&quot; was given to him by Hendrix to distinguish him from another Randy in the band, Randy Palmer, whom Hendrix dubbed &quot;Randy Texas&quot;. When Hendrix and California were invited to come to England by Chas Chandler, former bassist of British Invasion band the Animals—who became Hendrix&#x27;s manager and producer—Randy&#x27;s parents refused to allow him to go, insisting the 15-year-old stay and finish high school. By some accounts, Chandler wanted Hendrix as the only guitarist for the band and nixed California&#x27;s going to England.

Together with Cassidy, songwriter/front man Jay Ferguson, bassist Mark Andes (with whom California and Cassidy had initially formed a band called the Red Roosters) and keyboardist John Locke, California founded the band Spirit. Their first, self-titled album was released in January 1968, a month before California&#x27;s 17th birthday.

He then wrote the band&#x27;s biggest hit, 1968&#x27;s &quot;I Got a Line on You&quot; for Spirit&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Family That Plays Together&quot;. He also wrote the single &quot;1984&quot;, inspired by George Orwell&#x27;s novel of the same name. Released in early 1970, &quot;the song was so pointed against the U.S. government that it was banned from many radio stations, although it was a huge hit in Germany.&quot; In Canada the song reached #66. California also wrote Spirit&#x27;s other hit, &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot;, for the band&#x27;s best-selling album, &quot;Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus&quot;.

==Career==
Spirit was invited to open for Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. However, band manager/producer Lou Adler—who had been one of the founders of the rock festival movement two years earlier, as a partner (with Mamas &amp; Papas frontman John Phillips) in the Monterey Pop Festival, where Hendrix premiered in the U.S.—opposed it because the band was busy promoting their latest album, &quot;Clear&quot;.

When Ferguson and Andes left Spirit to form Jo Jo Gunne due to the slow sales of &quot;Sardonicus&quot;, and then his dear friend Hendrix died, a depressed California left Spirit. He recorded &quot;Kapt. Kopter &amp; The Fabulous Twirly Birds&quot;, which included California and Cassidy&#x27;s version of Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Mother and Child Reunion&quot; plus a slew of Hendrix-inspired tracks (also featuring former Experience bassist Noel Redding, AKA &#x27;Clit McTorius&#x27;). In 1972 the album was released at virtually the same moment as Jo Jo Gunne&#x27;s first, eponymous album that featured &quot;Run, Run Run&quot; and a Spirit album called &quot;Feedback&quot; that was recorded by Cassidy and Locke (who were Spirit&#x27;s jazz influences) and guitarist/bassist brother duo Al and John Staehely, who wrote and sang most of the material on the LP.

==Stairway to Heaven copyright dispute==
In writing Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, Jimmy Page allegedly lifted California&#x27;s guitar riff from &quot;Taurus&quot;, an instrumental song from the first Spirit album. Led Zeppelin was on the same bill as Spirit on two American music festival dates in 1969. In the liner notes for the 1996 reissue of Spirit&#x27;s first album, California stated: &quot;people always ask me why &#x27;Stairway to Heaven&#x27; sounds exactly like &#x27;Taurus,&#x27; which was released two years earlier. I know Led Zeppelin also played &#x27;Fresh Garbage&#x27; in their live set. They opened up for us on their first American tour&quot;. The fact that &quot;Fresh Garbage&quot; was a track from the same album that includes the song &quot;Taurus&quot; further suggested that Led Zeppelin was likely aware of the song enough to lead to a belated 2014 copyright infringement and injunction lawsuit against the reissue of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, with the lawyer stating, &quot;The idea behind this is to make sure that Randy California is given a writing credit on &#x27;Stairway to Heaven&#x27;.&quot;

In June 2016, after a trial that included audio recordings of several versions of both songs but not the Spirit and Led Zeppelin recordings, and also featured testimony from Page and bandmate Robert Plant explaining the songwriting process for &quot;Stairway&quot;, a jury ruled that Page and Plant had not copied &quot;Taurus&quot;. The decision came under appeal because the judge did not permit the two sound recordings to be played and instead allowed only sheet music. Copyright law had been expanded to include sound recordings in 1974. In September 2018, this decision was overturned. A new trial was unanimously ordered by a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on the basis that U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner gave jurors erroneous information about copyright law. The panel&#x27;s decision was subsequently vacated when the Ninth Circuit voted to rehear the case en banc. In September 2019 the appeals court heard introductory arguments and began deliberations as to whether a new trial is in fact warranted. The main issue is that the recording of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; resembles &quot;Taurus&quot; much more than does the printed sheet music, and comments by the court have indicated a possible inclination to hold that only the sheet music pertains to the copyright. On March 9, 2020, the Ninth Circuit ruled against California&#x27;s estate and re-instated the June 2016 jury verdict. This ruling effectively eliminated the &quot;inverse ratio&quot; rule and could have tremendous impact on future copyright law in the recording industry. In October 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear the case, leaving the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision in place and effectively ending the dispute.

==Death==
California drowned in the Pacific Ocean on January 2, 1997 at the age of 45 while rescuing his 12-year-old son Quinn from a rip current near his mother&#x27;s home at Molokai, Hawaii. He managed to push Quinn (who survived) toward the shore.

The Randy Craig Wolfe Trust was established after his death and, using royalties from California&#x27;s recording contracts, financially supports the Randy California Project, an after-school music education program for underprivileged elementary school children in Ventura County.

<text>The Palm Treo (stylized as Trēo) is a discontinued line of smartphones originally developed by Handspring, which was bought by Palm, Inc. They were then manufactured and maintained by Palm, Inc. Treos had a number of integrated features such as the ability to check the calendar while talking on the phone, dial directly from a list of contacts, and send email messages. The final models included a built-in camera. Treos ran Palm OS, but later models also ran Windows Mobile. The Palm Pre, released in June 2009, replaced the Treo series.

==Treo devices==
A total of nineteen Treo models were released, listed below in reverse chronological order. Treos through the 680 series used Palm OS. Beginning with the 700 series, Treos ran both Palm OS and Windows Mobile. The Treo 700w was the first of the 700 line, and the first Treo to use Windows Mobile. On August 19, 2008, Palm released the last Treo device, the Treo Pro on GSM. The Treo Pro on CDMA began sales in March 2009.

<doc id="1289963" wikidata="Q750178" url="?curid=1289963" title="Basis point">
<text>A basis point (often abbreviated as bp, often pronounced as &quot;bip&quot; or &quot;beep&quot;) is one hundredth of 1 percentage point. Changes of interest rates are often stated in basis points. For example, if an existing interest rate of 10 percent is increased by 1 basis point, the new interest rate would be 10.01 percent.

The related term &quot;permyriad&quot; means one part per ten thousand.

==Definition==

:1 basis point (bp) = 1‱, 0.1‰, 0.01%, 10−4, , or 0.0001.
:10 bp = 10‱, 1‰, 0.1%, 10−3, , or 0.001.
:100 bp = 100‱, 10‰, 1%, 10−2, , or 0.01.

Basis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1% are discussed. The most common example is interest rates, where differences in interest rates of less than 1% per year are usually meaningful to talk about. For example, a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points (e.g., a 4.67% rate increases by 10 basis points to 4.77%). In other words, an increase of 100 basis points means a rise by 1 percentage point.

Like percentage points, basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate. For example, if a report says there has been a &quot;1% increase&quot; from a 10% interest rate, this could refer to an increase either from 10% to 10.1% (relative, 1% of 10%), or from 10% to 11% (absolute, 1% plus 10%). However, if the report says there has been a &quot;100 basis point increase&quot; from a 10% interest rate, then the interest rate of 10% has increased by 1.00% (the absolute change) to an 11% rate.

It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument, or the difference (spread) between two interest rates, including the yields of fixed-income securities.

Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security, they will often be quoted as a spread over (or under) the index. For example, a loan that bears interest of 0.50% per annum above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is said to be 50 basis points over SOFR, which is commonly expressed as &quot;S+50bps&quot; or simply &quot;S+50&quot;.

The term &quot;basis point&quot; has its origins in trading the &quot;basis&quot; or the spread between two interest rates. Since the basis is usually small, these are quoted multiplied up by 10,000, and hence a &quot;full point&quot; movement in the &quot;basis&quot; is a basis point. Contrast with pips in FX forward markets.

Expense ratios of investment funds are often quoted in basis points.

==Permyriad==
A related concept is one part per ten thousand, . The same unit is also (rarely) called a permyriad, literally meaning &quot;for (every) myriad (ten thousand)&quot;. If used interchangeably with basis point, the permyriad is potentially confusing because an increase of one basis point to a 10 basis point value is generally understood to mean an increase to 11 basis points; not an increase of one part in ten thousand, meaning an increase to 10.001 basis points. This is akin to the difference between percentage and percentage point. 

===Unicode===
A permyriad is written with which looks like a percent sign with three zeroes to the right of the slash. (It can be regarded as a stylized form of the four zeros in the denominator of &quot;&quot;, although it originates as a natural extension of the percent and permille signs). There also exists an Arabic-Indic permyriad: .

<text>The Llanos (Spanish &quot;Los Llanos&quot;, &quot;The Plains&quot;; ) is a vast tropical grassland plain situated to the east of the Andes in Colombia and Venezuela, in northwestern South America. It is an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome.

==Geography==
The Llanos occupy a lowland that extends mostly east and west. The Llanos are bounded on the west and northwest by the Andes, and on the north by the Venezuelan Coastal Range. The Guiana Highlands are to the southeast, and the Negro-Branco moist forests are to the southwest. To the east the Orinoco wetlands and Orinoco Delta swamp forests occupy the Orinoco Delta.

The Llanos&#x27; main river is the Orinoco, which runs from west to east through the ecoregion and forms part of the border between Colombia and Venezuela. The Orinoco is the major river system of Venezuela.

==Climate==
The ecoregion has a tropical savanna climate that grades into a tropical monsoon climate in the Colombian Llanos. Rainfall is highly seasonal, with a rainy season from April to November, and a dry season between December and March. The wettest months are typically June and July. Rainfall varies across the ecoregion, from up to per year in the southwest, in Apure State, and per year in the Llanos of Monagas State in the northeast. Mean annual temperature is , and the average monthly temperature varies little throughout the year; the lowest-temperature months (June, July, December, and January) are only cooler than the hottest months.

==Flora==
The plant communities in the Llanos include open grasslands, savannas with scattered trees or clumps of trees, and small areas of forest, typically gallery forests along rivers and streams. There are seasonally flooded grasslands and savannas (&quot;llano bajo&quot;) and grasslands and savannas that remain dry throughout the year (&quot;llano alto&quot;).

The llano alto grasslands and savannas are characterized by grasses and shrubs 30–100 cm high, forming tussocks 10 to 30 cm apart. Soils are typically sandy and nutrient-poor. Llano alto covers approximately two-thirds of the Venezuelan llanos, and is also widespread in the Colombian llanos. Grasses of genus &quot;Trachypogon&quot; are predominant, and species include &quot;Trachypogon plumosus, T. vestitus, Axonopus canescens, A. anceps, Andropogon selloanus, Aristida&quot; spp., &quot;Leptocoryphium lanatum, Paspalum carinatum, Sporobolus indicus&quot;, and &quot;S. cubensis&quot;, and sedges in the genera &quot;Rhynchospora&quot; and &quot;Bulbostylis&quot;. Shrubs and herbs are most commonly legumes in the genera &quot;Mimosa, Cassia, Desmodium, Eriosema, Galactia, Indigofera, Phaseolus, Stylosanthes, Tephrosia&quot;, and &quot;Zornia&quot;. The trees manteco (&quot;Byrsonima crassifolia&quot;), chaparro (&quot;Curatella americana&quot;), and alcornoque (&quot;Bowdichia virgilioides&quot;) are the most common, growing either as scattered trees or in woodland patches known as &quot;matas&quot; which range in area from 12 meters in diameter up to a hectare.

During the rainy season from May to October, parts of the Llanos can flood up to a meter. This turns some savannass and grasslands into temporary wetlands, comparable to the Pantanal of central South America. This flooding also creates habitat for water birds and other wildlife. These seasonally flooded grasslands and savannas, known as llano bajo, typically have richer soils. They are characterized by the grass &quot;Paspalum fasciculatum&quot;. Trees include the palm &quot;Copernicia tectorum&quot; and gallery forest species.

Gallery forests include evergreen seasonally flooded forests, and semi-deciduous forests on higher ground. Morichales are seasonally flooded forests characterized by the moriche palm (&quot;Mauritia flexuosa&quot;). Vegas are seasonally flooded evergreen forests found along the Orinoco and its tributaries. Trees form a canopy 8 to 20 meters high, and include &quot;Inga&quot; spp., &quot;Combretum frangulifolium, Gustavia augusta, Pterocarpus&quot; sp., &quot;Pterocarpus dubius, Spondias mombin&quot;, and &quot;Copaifera pubiflora&quot;.

Semi-deciduous forests occur above flood level, and form a canopy 12 to 15 meters high. Common trees include &quot;Tabebuia billbergii, Godmania aesculifolia, Cassia moschata, Spondias mombin, Copaifera pubiflora, Bourreria cumanensis, Cordia&quot; spp., &quot;Bursera simaruba, Cochlospermum vitifolium, Hura crepitans&quot;, and &quot;Acacia glomerosa&quot;.

&quot;Matorrales&quot; are deciduous and semi-deciduous shrublands 5 to 8 meters high which cover large areas in the central Venezuelan llanos, and may be a form of secondary vegetation in areas that were formerly dry deciduous forest. Typical shrubs are &quot;Bourreria cumanensis, Randia aculeata, Godmania aesculifolia, Pereskia guamacho, Prosopis&quot; spp., &quot;Xylosma benthamii, Erytroxylum&quot; sp., and &quot;Cereus hexagonus&quot;.

==Fauna==
Mammals of the grassland and savanna include white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), giant anteater (&quot;Myrmecophaga tridactyla&quot;), capybara (&quot;Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris&quot;), giant armadillo (&quot;Priodontes maximus&quot;), Eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;), Alston&#x27;s cotton rat (&quot;Sigmodon alstoni&quot;), Hispid cotton rat (&quot;S. hispidus&quot;), &quot;Zygodontomys brevicauda&quot;, and &quot;Oecomys bicolor&quot;.

The gallery forests are home to more diverse large and medium-sized mammals, including collared peccary (&quot;Tayassu tajacu&quot;), white-lipped peccary (&quot;T. pecari&quot;), South American tapir (&quot;Tapirus terrestris&quot;), white-tailed deer, red brocket (&quot;Mazama americana&quot;), wedge-capped capuchin (&quot;Cebus olivaceus&quot;), Venezuelan red howler (&quot;Alouatta seniculus&quot;), large rodents like the lowland paca (&quot;Cuniculus paca&quot;), agoutis (&quot;Dasyprocta&quot; spp.), and Brazilian porcupine (&quot;Coendou prehensilis&quot;), and large cats like the puma (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;), and ocelot (&quot;Leopardus pardalis&quot;). The endangered giant otter (&quot;Pteronura brasiliensis&quot;) lives along the Orinoco and its tributaries.

Some of the largest jaguars in the world are found in the Llanos, with average weights of over for males.

The Llanos long-nosed armadillo (&quot;Dasypus sabanicola&quot;) and the short-tailed opossum &quot;Monodelphis orinoci&quot; are endemic to the Llanos.

The Llanos&#x27; wetlands supports around 70 species of water birds, including the scarlet ibis. A large portion of the distribution of the sharp-tailed ibis (&quot;Cercibis oxycerca&quot;) and white-bearded flycatcher (&quot;Phelpsia inornata&quot;) is in the Llanos.

Native reptiles include the Orinoco crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus intermedius&quot;), spectacled caiman (&quot;Caiman crocodilus&quot;), Green anaconda (&quot;Eunectes murinus&quot;), and Arrau turtle (&quot;Podocnemis expansa&quot;), which live in the ecoregion&#x27;s wetlands.

==Indigenous peoples==
Indigenous peoples of the Llanos include the Guahibo in the western Llanos of Colombia and Venezuela, and the Yaruro in the eastern Llanos in Venezuela.

==Cattle raising and farming==
The primary economic activity in the Llanos since the Spanish colonial era is the herding of millions of cattle. An 1856 watercolor by Manuel María Paz depicts sparsely populated open grazing lands with cattle and palm trees. The term &quot;llanero&quot; (&quot;plainsman&quot;) became synonymous with the cowhands that took care of the herds, and had some cultural similarities with the gauchos of the Pampas or the &quot;vaqueros&quot; of Spanish and Mexican Texas.

Decades of extensive cattle raising has altered the ecology of the Llanos. Grasslands and savannas are frequently burned to make them more suitable for grazing and eliminate trees and shrubs. Non-native grasses have been introduced for cattle fodder, including the African grass &quot;Melinis minutiflora&quot;, and now cover large areas.

Agriculture, particularly rice and maize, now cover extensive areas, including rice fields in former seasonal wetlands.

==Oil and gas==
In Los Llanos, the governments of Venezuela and Colombia developed a strong oil and gas industry in Arauca, Casanare, Guárico, Anzoátegui, Apure, and Monagas. The Orinoco Belt, entirely in Venezuelan territory, consists of large deposits of extra heavy crude (oil sands). The Orinoco Belt oil sands are known to be one of the largest, behind that of the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada. Venezuela&#x27;s non-conventional oil deposits of about , found primarily in the Orinoco oil sands, are estimated to approximately equal the world&#x27;s conventional oil reserves.

==Protected areas==
A 2017 assessment found that 105,323 km², or 28%, of the ecoregion, is in protected areas. Protected areas include Aguaro-Guariquito National Park (5,857.5 km²), Cinaruco-Capanaparo National Park (5,843.68 km²), Tortuga Arrau Reserve (98.56 km²), and Caño Guaritico Wildlife Refuge (93.0 km²) in Venezuela, and El Tuparro National Natural Park (5,549.08 km²) in Colombia.

<text>Elverson Road is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in the St John&#x27;s area of Lewisham in south east London, and situated in a residential neighbourhood. Opening in 1999 as part of the Lewisham extension, Elverson road station is one of the newer stations of the DLR network situated between Lewisham and Deptford Bridge.

Upon opening, the station was one of the most lightly used on the DLR network, but traffic has increased significantly following the construction of several new apartment complexes in the area.

The station is located between Deptford Bridge and Lewisham stations, and is on the boundary of Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3.

The station site straddles the boundary between the boroughs of Lewisham and Greenwich, and passengers must briefly cross into Greenwich when walking over the footbridge to reach the opposite platform.

Selective Door Operation is in use at this station as it cannot accommodate 3-car trains. Passengers wishing to alight at Elverson road must move towards the centre of the train (like Cutty Sark DLR) to alight.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Elverson Road is:
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours running to and from instead of Bank.

<doc id="1289977" wikidata="Q631566" url="?curid=1289977" title="Fistulina hepatica">
<text>Fistulina hepatica, commonly known as the beefsteak fungus, beefsteak polypore, poor man’s steak, ox tongue, or tongue mushroom, is an unusual bracket fungus classified in the Agaricales. It can be found in Europe, Africa, Australia, and North America.

As its name suggests, it looks much like a slab of raw meat. It has been used as a meat substitute in the past, and can still be found in some French markets. It has a sour, slightly acidic taste. For eating, it must be collected young and it may be tough and need to be cooked for a long time.

== Description ==
The cap is wide and thick. Its shape resembles a large tongue and it is rough-surfaced. It is pinkish-red when young, darkening to reddish-brown with age. The spores are pink and released from minute pores on the creamy-white underside of the fruit body. It bleeds a dull red juice when cut, which can cause stains, and the cut flesh further resembles meat. It is sour in taste.

The underside of the fruiting body, from which the spores are ejected, is a mass of tubules.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Fistulina&quot; is classified in the family Fistulinaceae; molecular studies suggest close relations to the &quot;agaric&quot; mushroom &quot;Schizophyllum&quot; in the Schizophyllaceae (in the &quot;schizophylloid&quot; clade), but in the separate sister &quot;fistulinoid&quot; clade. &quot;Fistulina&quot; is a cyphelloid genus, meaning that it is closely related to gilled fungi, but its fertile surface consists of smooth cup-shaped elements instead of gills. The underside (the hymenium) is a mass of tubules which represent a &quot;reduced&quot; form of the ancestral gills.

=== Etymology ===
The genus name is a diminutive of the Latin word fistula and means &quot;small tube&quot;, whilst the species name &quot;hepatica&quot; means &quot;liver-like&quot;, referring to the consistency of the flesh.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is commonly seen in Britain and the rest of Europe from July to October, but can also be found in North America, Australia, North Africa, and Southern Africa.

It is fairly common, and can often be found on oaks and sweet chestnut, from August to the end of autumn, on either living or dead wood. It has a tendency to impart a reddish-brown stain to the living wood of oaks, creating a desirable timber type. In Australia, it can be found growing from wounds on &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees. It causes a brown rot on the trees which it infects.

== Uses ==
It is edible and considered choice by some, although older specimens should be soaked overnight, as their juice can cause gastric upset. It does not tend to preserve well.

<doc id="1289980" wikidata="Q1784010" url="?curid=1289980" title="Lambton Worm">
<text>The Lambton Worm is a legend from County Durham in North-East England in the United Kingdom. The story takes place around the River Wear, and is one of the area&#x27;s most famous pieces of folklore, having been adapted from written and oral tradition into pantomime and song formats.

== The legend ==
The story revolves around John Lambton, an heir of the Lambton Estate, County Durham (in ceremonial Tyne and Wear), and his battle with a giant worm (dragon) that had been terrorising the local villages.

=== Origin of the worm ===
The story states that the young John Lambton was a rebellious character who missed church one Sunday to go fishing in the River Wear. In many versions of the story, while walking to the river, or setting up his equipment, John receives warnings from an old man (or a witch – depending on who tells the story) that no good can come from missing church.

John Lambton does not catch anything until the church service finishes, at which point he fishes out a small eel- or lamprey-like creature with nine holes on each side of its salamander-like head. Depending on the version of the story, the worm is no bigger than a thumb, or about long. In some renditions it has legs, while in others it is said to more closely resemble a snake.

At this point, the old man returns, although in some versions it is a different character. John declares that he has &quot;catched [caught] the devil&quot; and decides to dispose of his catch by discarding it down a nearby well. The old man then issues further warnings about the nature of the beast.

John then forgets about the creature and eventually grows up. As a penance for his rebellious early years, he joins the Crusades.

=== The worm&#x27;s wrath ===
Eventually, the worm grows extremely large and the well becomes poisonous. The villagers start to notice livestock going missing and discover that the fully-grown worm has emerged from the well and coiled itself around a local hill.

Earlier, and local, versions of the legend associate the hill with Worm Hill, in Fatfield. In most versions of the story, the worm is large enough to wrap itself around the hill seven times. It is said that one can still see the marks of the worm on Worm Hill. However, in the later song the hill is Penshaw Hill on which the Penshaw Monument now stands.

The worm terrorises the nearby villages, eating sheep, preventing cows from producing milk, and snatching away small children. It then heads towards Lambton Castle, where the Lord (John Lambton&#x27;s aged father) manages to sedate the creature in what becomes a daily ritual of offering the worm the milk of nine good cows – twenty gallons, or a filled trough.

A number of brave villagers try to kill the beast, but are quickly dispatched. When a chunk is cut off the worm, it simply reattaches the missing piece. Visiting knights also try to assault the beast, but none survive. When annoyed, the worm uproots trees by coiling its tail around them, then creates devastation by waving around the uprooted trees like a club.

===The vanquishing of the worm in the story===
After seven years, John Lambton returns from the Crusades to find his father&#x27;s estates almost destitute because of the worm. John decides to fight it, but first seeks the guidance of a wise woman or witch near Durham.

The witch hardens John&#x27;s resolve to kill the beast by explaining his responsibility for the worm. She tells him to cover his armour in spearheads and fight the worm in the River Wear, where it now spends its days wrapped around a great rock. The witch also tells John that after killing the worm he must then kill the first living thing he sees, or else his family will be cursed for nine generations and will not die in their beds.

John prepares his armour according to the witch&#x27;s instructions and arranges with his father that, when he has killed the worm, he will sound his hunting horn three times. On this signal, his father is to release his favourite hound so that it will run to John, who can then kill the dog and thus avoid the curse.

John Lambton then fights the worm by the river. The worm tries to crush him, wrapping him in its coils, but it cuts itself on his armour&#x27;s spikes; the pieces of the worm fall into the river, and are washed away before they can join up again. Eventually, the worm is dead and John sounds his hunting horn three times.

=== The Lambton curse ===
Unfortunately, John&#x27;s father is so excited that the beast is dead that he forgets to release the hound and rushes out to congratulate his son. John cannot bear to kill his father and so, after they meet, the hound is released and dutifully dispatched. But it is too late and nine generations of Lambtons are cursed so they shall not die peacefully in their beds. Thus, the story ends.

This curse seems to have held true for at least three generations, possibly helping to contribute to the popularity of the story.
* 1st generation: Robert Lambton, drowned at Newrig.
* 2nd: Sir William Lambton, a Colonel of Foot, killed at Marston Moor.
* 3rd: William Lambton, died in battle at Wakefield.
* 9th: Henry Lambton, died in his carriage crossing Lambton Bridge on 26 June 1761.

(One of Henry Lambton&#x27;s brothers, described as &quot;[h]is succeeding brother, the General&quot;, is said to have kept a horse whip by his bedside to ward off violent assaults. He died in his bed at an old age.)

== Cultural impact ==

=== Song ===

The story was made into a song (Roud #2337), written in 1867 by C. M. Leumane, which passed into oral tradition and has several slightly different variants (most notably the use of &quot;goggly&quot; or &quot;googly&quot; eyes meaning bulging and searching, a term formerly widely used on Wearside). It features several words only found in Northumbrian dialect.

=== Comics and literature ===
* Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1911 novel &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; and Ian Watson&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;The Fire Worm&quot; draw heavily on the Lambton Worm legend.
* This myth, along with many others originating from the North East, is retold in the graphic novel &quot;Alice in Sunderland&quot; by Bryan Talbot.
* Jeff Smith&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Rose&quot; has the title character following the same instructions to order to defeat a dragon.
* The Lambton Worm legend, including the subsequent death of Henry Lambton, is referred to in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;Mason and Dixon&quot;; typically, given the themes of mythology and historiography within the novel, Pynchon alters some details of the legend (for instance, moving to Transylvania the location of the &quot;wise woman&quot; who gives advice given to John Lambton on how to defeat the worm).
* A version of the tale was published by Joseph Jacobs, using William Henderson&#x27;s text in &quot;Folk-Lore of Northern Counties&quot; as a source.
* &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; may have been partly inspired by the legend of the Lambton Worm.
* Willam Mayne&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Worm in the Well,&quot; published in 2002, is an adapted retelling of the Lambton Worm legend.
* Sarah Hindmarsh&#x27;s &quot;The Worm,&quot; a short story published in &quot;The Forgotten and the Fantastical 2,&quot; edited by Teika Bellamy, is based on the Lambton Worm story.
* The modern fantasy novel &quot;The Green Man&#x27;s Heir&quot; (2018) by Juliet E. McKenna features a surviving juvenile specimen and the urgent need to counter the threat it presents.
* In 2018, Mike Mignola &amp; Ben Steinbeck produced a short comic titled &quot;Return of the Lambton Worm,&quot; which features a confrontation between the monster and Hellboy.

=== Opera ===
&quot;The Lambton Worm&quot; (1978) is an opera in two acts by the composer Robert Sherlaw Johnson with a libretto by the Oxford poet Anne Ridler. There are eleven solo roles (four of them major), a chorus and orchestra.

=== Film ===
* The 1988 film &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; is based on Stoker&#x27;s novel. Leumane&#x27;s song is recast in the film as the &quot;d&#x27;Ampton Worm&quot;, arranged by Emilio Perez Machado and Stephan Powys, and performed by them and Louise Newman.
* In 1989, screenwriter Anthony Shaffer wrote a film treatment for &quot;The Loathsome Lambton Worm&quot;, a direct sequel to his 1973 film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;. The sequel would have involved the original film&#x27;s protagonist, a Scottish police officer, battling the Lambton Worm. However, it was never officially produced.
* A fan-made full-cast audio drama adaptation of Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;The Loathsome Lambton Worm&quot; treatment was eventually released in 2020.

<text>Laetare Sunday (Church Latin: ; Classical Latin: ; English: ) is the fourth Sunday in the season of Lent, in the Western Christian liturgical calendar. Traditionally, this Sunday has been a day of celebration within the austere period of Lent. This Sunday gets its name from the first few words () of the traditional Latin entrance verse (Introit) for the Mass of the day. (&quot;Rejoice, O Jerusalem&quot;) is Latin from Isaiah 66:10.

==History==
The term &quot;Laetare Sunday&quot; is used by most Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican churches. The Latin is an imperative: &quot;rejoice!&quot;

The full Introit reads:

 Psalm: 
Rejoice ye with Jerusalem; and be ye glad for her, all ye that delight in her: exult and sing for joy with her, all ye that in sadness mourn for her; that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations. &quot;Psalm&quot;: I was glad when they said unto me, We will go into the house of the Lord.

==Alternative names==
This Sunday is currently also known as Mothering Sunday, Refreshment Sunday, mid-Lent Sunday (in French ) and Rose Sunday (either because the golden rose sent by Popes to Catholic sovereigns used to be blessed at this time, or because the use of rose-colored rather than violet vestments was permitted on this day).

Historically, the day was also known as &quot;the Sunday of the Five Loaves,&quot; from the story of the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Before the adoption of the modern &quot;common lectionaries&quot;, this narrative was the traditional Gospel reading for this Sunday in Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and Old Catholic churches.

The station church at Rome for this day was Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, one of the seven chief basilicas; the Golden Rose, sent by Popes to Catholic sovereigns, used to be blessed at this time and for this reason the day was sometimes called &quot;Dominica de Rosa&quot;.

==Customs==

On Mothering Sunday, Christians have historically visited their mother church—the church in which they received the sacrament of baptism.

In Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and Old Catholic churches flowers may appear on the high altar and the organ may be played as a solo instrument. Priests are given the option to wear rose-colored vestments at Mass held on this day in place of the violet vestments normally worn during Lent. The term &quot;rose&quot; is used to describe this lighter shade of the color violet in the Roman Rite.

The Sunday is considered a day of relaxation from normal Lenten rigours; a day of hope with Easter at last within sight. Traditionally, weddings (otherwise banned during Lent) could be performed on this day, and servants were released from service for the day to visit their mother church, the place in which they received the sacrament of baptism (hence &#x27;Mothering Sunday&#x27;).

Laetare Sunday is the date on which the recipient of University of Notre Dame&#x27;s Laetare Medal is announced.

==Date==
Laetare Sunday is exactly 21 days before Easter Sunday, a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon.

<doc id="1289984" wikidata="Q6934970" url="?curid=1289984" title="Multiple units of Ireland">
<text>A wide variety of diesel and electric multiple units have been used on Ireland&#x27;s railways. This page lists all those that have been used. Except with the NIR Class 3000, the numbers given by each class in the lists below are those allocated to the coaches that make up the units in that class, otherwise, unit numbers are not used in Ireland.

==Republic of Ireland==
Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), which controlled the Republic&#x27;s railways between 1945 and 1987, mainly used locomotives and hauled stock for its passenger trains. What diesel multiple unit cars it did have were numbered in the 26xx series. Since 1987, Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) has been increasing the use of this type of train, to replace older locomotives and carriages. The only electrified railway network in Ireland is the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) system, in addition to the Luas which runs on a separate network. Its fleet of electric multiple units are numbered in the 8xxx series.

Despite appearing to be a DMU (especially the Driving Van-Trailer end), the Dublin Cork service Mark 4 is an 8-car Push–pull train.

===Diesel multiple units===
===Electric multiple units===
==Northern Ireland==
The majority of passenger services in Northern Ireland have been operated by diesel multiple units since the mid-1950s (the major exception being the locomotive-hauled &quot;Enterprise&quot; service between Belfast and Dublin), under the tenure of both the Ulster Transport Authority (1948–1966) and Northern Ireland Railways (since 1967). From 2001, all items of rolling stock in use on NIR had 8000 added to their number so as to be part of the Translink number series, which incorporates their road vehicles. The 3000 Class stock are the first multiple units to be numbered from new in the Translink series. NIR purchased an additional 20 Class 4000 DMUs which entered service in 2011 and 2012.

NIR purchased a Windhoff Multi-Purpose Vehicle for use as the Rail Head Treatment Train, equipped to lay sandite and high-pressure water. The MPV was procured to replace a converted Class 80 unit.
==Great Northern Railway (Ireland)==
The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) straddled the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, and so was not incorporated in either the CIE or UTA. However, mounting losses saw the network purchased jointly by the Irish and British governments on Tuesday 1 September 1953. It was run as a joint board, independent of the CIE and UTA, until Tuesday 30 September 1958 when it was dissolved and the remaining stock split equally between the 2 railways.

<text>Penshaw , formerly known as &quot;Painshaw&quot; or &quot;Pensher&quot; is a village in the metropolitan district of Sunderland, in Tyne and Wear, England. Historically, Penshaw was located in County Durham.

== Name and etymology ==
The name &quot;Penshaw&quot; was recorded in the 1190s as &quot;Pencher&quot; and is of Cumbric origin. The first element is &quot;pen&quot;, meaning &#x27;hill&#x27; or &#x27;summit&#x27; and the second &quot;*cerr/*carr&quot; - &#x27;stone, hard surface&#x27;.

== History ==
Penshaw was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Houghton-le-Spring, in 1866 Penshaw became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished and merged with Houghton le Spring and Offerton. In 1931 the parish had a population of 7183.

== Features ==
Penshaw is well known locally for Penshaw Monument, a prominent landmark built in 1844 atop Penshaw Hill, which is a half-scale replica of the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens. Owing to its proximity to Durham City, the area was allocated a Durham postcode, DH4, which forms part of the Houghton-le-Spring post town. It lies about three miles north of Houghton-le-Spring, just over the River Wear from Washington. It borders Herrington Country Park and is surrounded by a series of villages: Herrington, Shiney Row, Biddick, Coxgreen and Offerton.

Leisure facilities include the easily accessible Herrington Country Park, which contains a play area, amphitheatre, skateboard park, lake with extensive wildlife and a memorial site to Herrington Colliery which once mined the site for coal. The site hosts public events such as the county show which includes dog shows, face painting and bouncy castles. There are three public houses, The Prospect (original name recently restored), The Monument (formerly The Ship) and The Grey Horse. Though no working men&#x27;s club remains, a Catholic club is situated on Station Rd. Community facilities include Penshaw Community Centre and All Saints&#x27; Church Hall; both organise regular spring and summer events. In the village, at the foot of Penshaw Hill, is Penshaw Equestrian Centre. At the centre of Barnwell is an extensive playing field and young person&#x27;s play area. Penshaw also has three primary schools within walking distance of one other: Barnwell, New Penshaw and Our Lady Queen of Peace Roman Catholic.

There are two annual events for children, an easter egg rolling competition on Penshaw Hill and a scarecrow hunt Scarecrow Trail Event organised by the village community.

An annual cross-country event takes place in May or June each year when Sunderland Harriers stage the Penshaw Hill Race with a presentation to the winner and runners up in The Monument public house after the race.

There are extensive views from the top of Penshaw Hill on a clear day: Durham Cathedral to the South West, the coast of Roker and Seaburn to the East and the Cheviot Hills to the North.

The Hill, as it is known locally, also overlooks Wearside Golf Club, a long-established golf club originating in 1892 and Sunderland AFC&#x27;s Stadium of Light can also be seen clearly from here.

<text>The Anatomy of the Ship series of books are comprehensive treatments of the design and construction of individual ships. They have been published by Conway Maritime Press (now Conway Publishing) since the 1980s, and republished in the US by the Naval Institute Press.

== About the series ==

Each volume begins with a general history of the vessel, as preface to a set of detailed scale drawings showing every part of the interior and exterior, from keel to masthead. Black-and-white photographs and engravings, including of ship models for older types, round out the description. Since 1998, each volume has carried a large-scale plan on the reverse of the fold-off dust jacket.

According to its producers, the series ‘aims to provide the finest documentation of individual ships and ship types ever published. What makes the series unique is a complete set of superbly executed line drawings, both the conventional type of plan as well as explanatory views, with fully descriptive keys. These are supported by technical details and a record of the ship’s service.’

The ships chosen are a mix of famous vessels, such as and &quot;Yamato&quot;, and less-famous ships that are well-documented representatives of their class (, &quot;Lawhill&quot;).

== Classification ==

The series is divided into two distinct – yet broadly encompassing – categories, identified by colour coding. Firstly, those presented in a yellow-and-silver themed dust jacket relate to ‘non-motor-propelled’ ships. This group tracks the development of ship design from &quot;The Ships of Christopher Columbus&quot;, through to the end of the age of sail (those designed or constructed approximately up until the 1860s), such as the &quot;HMS Beagle: Survey Ship Extraordinaire, 1820–70&quot;, by Karl Heinz Marquardt.

Ships thereafter, powered by steam and screw propulsion, are represented in silver-and-blue themed dust jackets. These include submarines, the Japanese World War II vessel, &quot;The Battleship Yamato&quot;, by Janusz Skulski, and &quot;The Aircraft Carrier Victorious&quot;, by Ross Watton.

<text>The FISH (FIbonacci SHrinking) stream cipher is a fast software based stream cipher using Lagged Fibonacci generators, plus a concept from the shrinking generator cipher. It was published by Siemens in 1993. FISH is quite fast in software and has a huge key length. However, in the same paper where he proposed Pike, Ross Anderson showed that FISH can be broken with just a few thousand bits of known plaintext.

<text>Edward Claude Cassidy (May 4, 1923 – December 6, 2012) was an American jazz and rock drummer who was one of the founders of the rock group Spirit in 1967.

==Biography==
Cassidy was born in Harvey, Illinois, a south suburb of Chicago on May 4, 1923. His family moved to Bakersfield, California in 1931. Cassidy began his career as a professional musician in 1937. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and after his discharge held many jobs before becoming a full-time musician again. At one time in the late 1940s, Cassidy played 282 consecutive one-nighters in 17 states. He worked in show bands, Dixieland, and country and western bands, and on film soundtracks, as well as having a brief stint with the San Francisco Opera.

In 1950, Cassidy enrolled at college to get a musical teaching credential. However, after a year, he decided to move to Southern California to meet more jazz musicians and perhaps form a group of his own. During this period, Cassidy performed together with many leading jazz musicians including Art Pepper, Cannonball Adderley, Roland Kirk, Lee Konitz and Gerry Mulligan.

With Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder, Cassidy formed the Rising Sons in 1964. After that, he formed the Red Roosters in 1965, with his fourteen year-old stepson Randy California, Jay Ferguson and Mark Andes. Adding John Locke, they became Spirit in 1967. Cassidy sported a shaved head, which was unusual at that time, and he always wore black. He used a single bass drum, and two large parade bass drums as floor toms. Because California stepped out of the group for a period of time in 1972, following the death of Jimi Hendrix, Cassidy was the only member who played with all various line-ups of Spirit on almost 20 albums over almost 30 years. Spirit finally disbanded following California&#x27;s death in 1997. Cassidy later performed with Merrell Fankhauser in the Fankhauser Cassidy Band.

From the mid-1970s, Cassidy also worked as an actor, including live improvisation.

== Personal life and death ==
Cassidy had a wife, Beverly, a daughter, Carol Ann Griffith, a son, Christian Padriack Cassidy, and several stepchildren and grandchildren. He had previously been married to Bernice Pearl Wolfe, the mother of Randy California. Cassidy wrote, studied history, and continued to correspond with fans from his residence in Southern California until his death. He died of cancer in San Jose at the age of 89 on 6 December 2012.

<text>Themes is a compilation album of works by Greek electronic composer and artist Vangelis released in July 1989. It featured some previously released tracks from Vangelis&#x27;s other albums, as well as some pieces from movie soundtracks that had not previously been released.

The album is notable because it marked the first official appearances of Vangelis&#x27; music from the films &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;The Bounty&quot;, and &quot;Missing&quot;. Of these three film scores, only the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; soundtrack has since received an official release.

<doc id="1290018" wikidata="Q216594" url="?curid=1290018" title="Ed Miliband">
<text>Edward Samuel Miliband (born 24 December 1969) is a British politician who has served as Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero since July 2024. He has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Doncaster North since 2005. Miliband was Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition from 2010 to 2015. Alongside his brother, David Miliband, he served in the Cabinet from 2007 to 2010 under Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

Miliband was born in the Fitzrovia district of Central London to Marion Kozak and Ralph Miliband, Polish Jewish immigrants. His father was a Marxist intellectual and native of Brussels who fled Belgium during the Second World War. He graduated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford and later from the London School of Economics. Miliband became first a television journalist, then a Labour Party researcher and a visiting scholar at Harvard University, before rising to become one of Chancellor Gordon Brown&#x27;s confidants and chairman of HM Treasury&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers. He was elected to the House of Commons in 2005 and Prime Minister Tony Blair made him Minister for the Third Sector in May 2006. When Brown became Prime Minister in 2007, he appointed Miliband Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Miliband was subsequently promoted to the new post of Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, a position he held from 2008 to 2010.

After the Labour Party was defeated at the 2010 general election, Brown resigned as Leader of the Labour Party; in September 2010, Miliband was elected to replace him. His tenure as Labour leader was characterised by a leftward shift in his party&#x27;s policies under the &quot;One Nation Labour&quot; branding, and by opposition to the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government&#x27;s cuts to the public sector. Miliband also abolished the electoral college system to elect the leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party, and replaced it with a &quot;one member, one vote&quot; system in 2014. He led his party into several elections, including the 2014 European Parliament election.

Following Labour&#x27;s defeat by the Conservative Party at the 2015 general election, Miliband resigned as leader on 8 May 2015. He was succeeded following a leadership election by Jeremy Corbyn, and returned to the backbenches. In 2020, Sir Keir Starmer appointed Miliband Shadow Secretary of State for Climate Change and Net Zero. Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 2024 general election, Miliband returned to government after being appointed Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero by Starmer.

==Early life and education==
Ed Miliband was born on 24 December 1969 in University College Hospital in Fitzrovia, London. He is the son of immigrant parents, Belgian-born Marxist sociologist Ralph Miliband and Polish-born Marion Kozak, both from Polish Jewish families. His mother, a human rights campaigner and early CND member, survived the Holocaust thanks to being protected by Catholic Poles but her father, Ed&#x27;s maternal grandfather, did not. His father Ralph was a Marxist academic whose father fled with him to England during the Second World War. The family lived on Edis Street in Primrose Hill, London. His elder brother, David Miliband, still owns the house as of 2010.

Ralph Miliband left his academic post at the London School of Economics in 1972 to take up a chair at the University of Leeds as a professor of politics. His family moved to Leeds with him in 1973; Miliband attended Featherbank Infant School in Horsforth between 1974 and 1977, during which time he became a fan of Leeds United.

Owing to his father&#x27;s later employment as a roving teacher, Miliband spent two spells living in Boston, Massachusetts, one year when he was seven and one middle school term when he was twelve. Miliband remembered his time in the US as some of his happiest, during which he became a fan of American culture, watching &quot;Dallas&quot; and following the Boston Red Sox and the New England Patriots.

Between 1978 and 1981, Ed Miliband attended Primrose Hill Primary School, near Primrose Hill, in Camden and then from 1981 to 1989, Haverstock Comprehensive School in Chalk Farm. He learned to play the violin while at school, and as a teenager, he reviewed films and plays on LBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Young London&quot; programme as one of its fortnightly &quot;Three O&#x27;Clock Reviewers&quot;. After completing his O-levels, he worked as an intern to family friend Tony Benn, the MP for Chesterfield.

In 1989, Miliband gained four A Levels—in Mathematics (A), English (A), Further Mathematics (B) and Physics (B)—and then read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In his first year, he was elected JCR President, leading a student campaign against a rise in rent charges. In his second year he dropped philosophy, and was awarded an upper second class Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to graduate from the London School of Economics as a Master of Science in Economics.

==Political career ==

===Special adviser===
In 1992, after graduating from the University of Oxford, Miliband began his working career in the media as a researcher to co-presenter Andrew Rawnsley in the Channel 4 show &quot;A Week in Politics&quot;. In 1993, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Harriet Harman approached Rawnsley to recruit Miliband as her policy researcher and speechwriter. At the time, Yvette Cooper also worked for Harman as part of Labour&#x27;s Shadow Treasury team.

In 1994, when Harriet Harman was moved by the newly elected Labour Leader Tony Blair to become Shadow Secretary of State for Employment, Miliband stayed on in the Shadow Treasury team and was promoted to work for Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown. In 1995, with encouragement from Gordon Brown, Miliband took time out from his job to study at the London School of Economics, where he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in economics. Following Labour&#x27;s 1997 landslide victory, Miliband was appointed as a special adviser to Chancellor Gordon Brown from 1997 to 2002.

===Harvard===
On 25 July 2002, it was announced that Miliband would take a 12-month unpaid sabbatical from HM Treasury to be a visiting scholar at the Center for European Studies of Harvard University for two semesters. He spent his time at Harvard teaching economics, and stayed there after September 2003 for an additional semester teaching a course titled &quot;What&#x27;s Left? The Politics of Social Justice&quot;. During this time, he was granted &quot;access&quot; to Senator John Kerry and reported to Brown on the presidential hopeful&#x27;s progress. After Miliband returned to the UK in January 2004 Gordon Brown appointed him Chairman of HM Treasury&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers as a replacement for Ed Balls, with specific responsibility for directing the UK&#x27;s long-term economic planning.

== Parliamentary career ==
In early 2005, Miliband resigned his advisory role to HM Treasury to stand for election. Kevin Hughes, then the Labour MP for Doncaster North, announced in February of that year that he would be standing down at the next election due to being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. Miliband applied for selection to be the candidate in the safe Labour seat and won, beating off a close challenge from Michael Dugher, then a SPAD to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon.

Gordon Brown visited Doncaster North during the general election campaign to support his former adviser. Miliband was elected on 5 May 2005, with 55.5% of the vote and a majority of 12,656. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 23 May, responding to comments made by future Speaker John Bercow. In Blair&#x27;s frontbench reshuffle in May 2006, he was made Minister for the Third Sector, with responsibility for voluntary and charity organisations.

===Cabinet===
On 28 June 2007, the day after Brown became Prime Minister, Miliband was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, being promoted to the cabinet. This meant that he and his brother, Foreign Secretary David Miliband, became the first brothers to serve in a British cabinet since Edward and Oliver Stanley in 1938. He was additionally given the task of drafting Labour&#x27;s manifesto for the 2010 general election.

On 3 October 2008, Miliband was promoted to become Secretary of State for the newly created Department of Energy and Climate Change in a cabinet reshuffle. On 16 October, Miliband announced that the British government would legislate to oblige itself to cut greenhouse emissions by 80% by 2050, rather than the 60% cut in carbon dioxide emissions previously announced.

In March 2009, while Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Miliband attended the UK premiere of climate change film &quot;The Age of Stupid&quot;, where he was ambushed by actor Pete Postlethwaite, who threatened to return his OBE and vote for any party other than Labour if the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station were to be given the go-ahead by the government. A month later, Miliband announced to the House of Commons a change to the government&#x27;s policy on coal-fired power stations, saying that any potential new coal-fired power stations would be unable to receive government consent unless they could demonstrate that they would be able to effectively capture and bury 25% of the emissions they produce immediately, with a view to seeing that rise to 100% of emissions by 2025. This, a government source told &quot;the Guardian&quot;, effectively represented &quot;a complete rewrite of UK energy policy for the future&quot;.

Miliband represented the UK at the 2009 Copenhagen Summit, from which emerged a global commitment to provide an additional US$10 billion a year to fight the effects of climate change, with an additional $100 billion a year provided by 2020. The conference was not able to achieve a legally binding agreement. Miliband accused China of deliberately foiling attempts at a binding agreement; China explicitly denied this, accusing British politicians of engaging in a &quot;political scheme&quot;.

During the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal, Miliband was named by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; as one of the &quot;saints&quot; of the scandal, due to his claiming one of the lowest amounts of expenses in the House of Commons and submitting no claims that later had to be paid back.

==Leadership of the Labour Party (2010–2015)==
=== Leadership election ===

Following the formation of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government on 11 May 2010, Gordon Brown resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Deputy Leader Harriet Harman took over as Acting Leader and became Leader of the Opposition. On 14 May, Miliband announced that he would stand as a candidate in the forthcoming leadership election. He launched his campaign during a speech given at a Fabian Society conference and was nominated by 62 fellow Labour MPs. The other candidates were left-wing backbencher Diane Abbott, Shadow Education Secretary Ed Balls, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham and Miliband&#x27;s elder brother, Shadow Foreign Secretary David Miliband.

On 23 May, former Labour leader Neil Kinnock announced that he would endorse Ed Miliband&#x27;s campaign, saying that he had &quot;the capacity to inspire people&quot; and that he had &quot;strong values and the ability to &#x27;lift&#x27; people&quot;. Other senior Labour figures who backed the younger Miliband included Tony Benn and former deputy leaders Roy Hattersley and Margaret Beckett. By 9 June, the deadline for entry into the leadership election, Miliband had been nominated by just over 24% of the Parliamentary Labour Party, double the threshold. By September, Miliband had received the support of six trade unions, including both Unite and UNISON, 151 of 650 Constituency Labour Parties, three affiliated socialist societies, and half of Labour MEPs.

Miliband subsequently won the election, the result of which was announced on 25 September 2010, after second, third and fourth preferences votes were counted, achieving the support of 50.654% of the electoral college, defeating his brother by 1.3%. In the fourth and final stage of the redistribution of votes after three candidates had been eliminated, Ed Miliband led in the trade unions and affiliated organisations section of the electoral college (19.93% of the total to David&#x27;s 13.40%), but in both the MPs and MEPs section (15.52% to 17.81%), and Constituency Labour Party section (15.20% to 18.14%), came second. In the final round, Ed Miliband won with a total of 175,519 votes to David&#x27;s 147,220 votes.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===
Miliband&#x27;s tenure as Labour leader was characterised by a leftward shift in his party&#x27;s policies under the One Nation Labour branding which replaced the New Labour branding, and by opposition to the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government&#x27;s cuts to the public sector. Miliband also abolished the electoral college system to elect the leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party, and replaced it with a &quot;one member, one vote&quot; system in 2014.

===Shadow Cabinet===
The first election to the Shadow Cabinet that took place under Miliband&#x27;s leadership was on 7 October 2010. Ending days of speculation, David Miliband announced that he would not seek election to the Shadow Cabinet on 29 September, the day nominations closed, saying he wanted to avoid &quot;constant comparison&quot; with his brother Ed. The three other defeated candidates for the Labour leadership all stood in the election, though Diane Abbott failed to win enough votes to gain a place.

Following the election, Miliband unveiled his Shadow Cabinet on 8 October 2010. Among others, he appointed Alan Johnson as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Yvette Cooper was chosen as Shadow Foreign Secretary, and both defeated Labour leadership candidates Ed Balls and Andy Burnham were given senior roles, becoming Shadow Home Secretary and Shadow Education Secretary respectively. Burnham was also given responsibility for overseeing Labour&#x27;s election co-ordination.

Sadiq Khan, who managed Miliband&#x27;s successful leadership campaign, was appointed Shadow Justice Secretary and Shadow Lord Chancellor, and continuing Deputy Leader Harriet Harman continued to shadow Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, as well as being made Shadow International Development Secretary. Alan Johnson would later resign, stepping down for &quot;personal reasons&quot; on 20 January 2011, necessitating Miliband&#x27;s first reshuffle, in which he made Balls Shadow Chancellor, Cooper Shadow Home Secretary and Douglas Alexander Shadow Foreign Secretary.

=== Election results and resignation ===

Miliband&#x27;s first electoral tests as Labour Leader came in the elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and various councils across England, excluding London, on 5 May 2011. The results for Labour were described as a &quot;mixed bag&quot;, with the party performing well in Wales – falling just one seat short of an overall majority and forming the next Welsh Government on its own – and making large gains from the Liberal Democrats in northern councils, including Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester.

Miliband launched Labour&#x27;s campaign for the 2012 local elections with a speech in Birmingham, accusing the coalition government of &quot;betrayal&quot;, and claiming that it &quot;lacked the values&quot; that Britain needed. The Labour results were described as a success, with the party building on its performance the previous year in the north of England and Wales, consolidating its position in northern cities and winning control of places such as Cardiff and Swansea. Labour performed well in the Midlands and South of England, winning control of councils including Birmingham, Norwich, Plymouth and Southampton. Labour was less successful in Scotland than England and Wales, but retained control of Glasgow despite predictions it would not. Overall, Labour gained over 800 councillors and control of 22 councils.

In April 2013, Miliband pledged ahead of the upcoming county elections that Labour would change planning laws to give local authorities greater authority to decide what shops can open in their high streets. He also said that Labour would introduce more strenuous laws relating to pay-day lenders and betting shops. Labour subsequently gained nearly 300 councillors, as well as control of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire County Councils.

In May 2014, Miliband led Labour through the European Parliament elections, where the party increased its number of Members of the European Parliament from 13 to 20. Labour came second with 24.4% of the vote, finishing ahead of the Conservatives but behind UKIP. This was the first time since the 1984 that the largest opposition party had failed to win the most seats in European elections. On the same day, Labour polled ahead of all other parties at the local elections, winning 31% of the vote and taking control of six additional councils.

On 30 March 2015, a general election was called for 7 May. Miliband began his campaign by launching a &quot;manifesto for business&quot;, stating that only by voting Labour would the UK&#x27;s position within the European Union be secure. Miliband subsequently unveiled five pledges at a rally in Birmingham which would form the focus of a future Labour government, specifically identifying policies on deficit reduction, living standards, the NHS, immigration controls and tuition fees. He included an additional pledge on housing and rent on 27 April. On 14 April, Labour launched its full manifesto, which Miliband said was fully funded and would require no additional borrowing. During this time an online campaign began known as Milifandom.

Miliband was portrayed during Labour&#x27;s 2015 election campaign as being genuine in his desire to improve the lives of working people and to display progression from New Labour, but was unable to defeat interpretations of him as being ineffectual, or even cartoonish in nature. Miliband insisted that Cameron should debate him one on one as part of a televised election broadcast in order to highlight differences in policies between the two major parties, but this did not happen, with the pair instead being interviewed separately by Jeremy Paxman as part of the first major televised political broadcast of the election involving multiple parties.

Despite opinion polls leading up to the general election predicting a tight result, Labour decisively lost the 7 May general election to the Conservatives. Although gaining 22 seats, Labour lost all but one of its MPs in Scotland and ended up with a net loss of 26 seats, failing to win a number of key marginal seats that it had expected to win comfortably. After being returned as MP for Doncaster North, Miliband stated that it had been a &quot;difficult and disappointing&quot; night for Labour. Following Cameron&#x27;s success in forming a majority government, Miliband resigned as Leader of the Labour Party on 8 May, with Harman becoming acting leader while a leadership election was initiated. Jeremy Corbyn succeeded Miliband as leader.

== Post-leadership (2015–present) ==
=== Backbencher ===
As a backbencher, Miliband spoke about the need to tackle inequality and in favour of the Paris climate change agreement. In May 2016, he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, speaking in favour of Remain in the UK&#x27;s EU referendum and he subsequently campaigned for a Remain vote.

In the aftermath of the referendum result, Miliband said that, although he had supported Jeremy Corbyn since his election as leader, he had &quot;reluctantly reached the conclusion his position [was] untenable&quot;, calling for Corbyn to step down in June 2016. In the ensuing contest, Miliband supported leadership challenger Owen Smith. Miliband later admitted that he was &quot;clearly wrong&quot; to call for Corbyn&#x27;s resignation. In September 2016, Miliband joined the editorial board of &quot;The Political Quarterly&quot; journal, an unremunerated role.

Renewing his previous stance on the issue in 2011, Miliband criticised Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s bid to takeover telecommunications company Sky in December 2016, subsequently supporting an inquiry by Ofcom.

At the snap 2017 general election, Miliband was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 60.8% and an increased majority of 14,024.

At the 2019 general election, Miliband was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 38.7% and a decreased majority of 2,370. Following the election, it was announced that Miliband would sit on a panel of party figures to overview and investigate the electoral failure.

=== Return to Shadow Cabinet ===
On 6 April 2020, Keir Starmer appointed Miliband to his Shadow Cabinet, after winning the contest to become leader of the Labour Party two days before. Miliband assumed the role of Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in the new shadow cabinet.

In September 2020, Miliband faced Prime Minister Boris Johnson during a debate on the UK Internal Market Bill, in a speech accusing him of &quot;legislative hooliganism&quot;.

On 27 October 2021, Miliband took Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions following the October 2021 budget on behalf of Keir Starmer, who had contracted COVID-19.

In the November 2021 shadow cabinet reshuffle, Miliband was appointed to the newly established post of Shadow Secretary of State for Climate Change and Net Zero, assuming the energy responsibility from his previous role. He was succeeded as Shadow Secretary of State for Business and Industrial Strategy by Jonathan Reynolds. Miliband did not have a direct department to shadow until February 2023, when Grant Shapps was appointed Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero in the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. Accordingly, Miliband&#x27;s portfolio was renamed to Shadow Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, mirroring that of the government, in the 2023 shadow cabinet reshuffle.

Miliband&#x27;s re-appointment to the cabinet also led to the New Statesman naming him the twenty-first most influential British left-wing figure of 2023.

=== Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero ===
At the 2024 general election, Miliband was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 52.4% and an increased majority of 9,126. Following Labour&#x27;s victory at the general election, Miliband was appointed Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero by Starmer. He was among several ministers under Blair and Brown to be appointed to Starmer&#x27;s cabinet. Two days after being appointed, Miliband lifted the onshore wind ban. He has clarified that despite disagreeing with the prospect of building a third runway at Heathrow Airport, he would not be resigning over the matter.

==Policies and views==
Miliband is generally seen as being on the soft left of the Labour Party.

===Self-described views===

Miliband described himself as a new type of Labour politician, looking to move beyond the divisiveness of Blairism and Brownism, and calling for an end to the &quot;factionalism and psychodramas&quot; of Labour&#x27;s past. He also repeatedly spoke of the need for a &quot;new politics&quot;.

During the Labour leadership campaign, he described himself as a socialist, and spoke out against some of the actions of the Blair ministry, including criticising its record on civil liberties and foreign policy. Though he was not yet an MP at the time of the 2003 vote, Miliband was a strong critic of the Iraq War. He backed UK military action and intervention in Afghanistan and Libya respectively.

Miliband called for &quot;responsible capitalism&quot; when Google&#x27;s Eric Schmidt commented on his corporation&#x27;s non-payment of tax. He also supported making the UK&#x27;s 50% top rate of tax permanent, as well as the institution of a new financial transaction tax, mutualising Northern Rock, putting limits on top salaries, scrapping tuition fees in favour of a graduate tax, implementing a living wage policy and the scrapping of the ID cards policy, and spoke in favour of a &quot;National Care Service&quot;.

Miliband worked closely with the think tank Policy Network on the concept of predistribution as a means to tackle what he described as &#x27;the growing crisis in living standards&#x27;. His announcement that predistribution would become a cornerstone of the UK Labour Party&#x27;s economic policy was jokingly mocked by Prime Minister David Cameron during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in the House of Commons.

Though Labour remained officially neutral, he in a personal capacity supported the failed &quot;Yes to AV&quot; campaign in the Alternative Vote referendum on 5 May 2011, saying that it would benefit Britain&#x27;s &quot;progressive majority&quot;. In September 2011, Miliband stated that a future Labour Government would immediately cut the cap on tuition fees for university students from £9,000 per year to £6,000, though he also stated that he remained committed to a graduate tax in the long-run. Together with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, Miliband also promoted a &quot;five-point plan for jobs and growth&quot; aimed at helping the UK economy, involving extending the bonus tax on banks pioneered by Alistair Darling, bringing forward planned long-term investment to help reduce unemployment, cutting the rate of VAT from 20% back to 17.5%, cutting VAT on home improvements to 5% for a temporary one-year period, and instigating a one-year National Insurance break to encourage employers to hire more staff.
Miliband also endorsed the Blue Labour trend in the Labour Party, founded by Maurice Glasman. This was seen to have influenced his 2011 conference speech, signalling &quot;predatory and productive capitalism&quot;.

Miliband is progressive in regard to issues of gender and sexuality. He publicly identifies as a feminist. In March 2012, Miliband pledged his support for same sex marriage. As he signed an &#x27;equal marriage pledge&#x27;, he said, &quot;I strongly agree gay and lesbian couples should have an equal right to marry and deserve the same recognition from the state and society as anyone else.&quot;

In June 2014, while speaking to the Labour Friends of Israel, Miliband stated that if he became Prime Minister he would seek &quot;closer ties&quot; with Israel and opposed the boycott of Israeli goods, saying that he would &quot;resolutely oppose the isolation of Israel&quot; and that nobody in the Labour Party should question Israel&#x27;s right to exist. He also stated that, as a Jew and a friend of Israel, he must criticise Israel when necessary, opposing the &quot;killing of innocent Palestinian civilians&quot;. Miliband criticised Israel for its conduct during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.

Since the end of his leadership of the Labour Party, Miliband has expressed regret for not having been &quot;radical enough&quot; in his manifesto, and has described himself as &quot;not following the normal route, which is to become more right wing as you get older&quot;, but instead becoming &quot;more left wing&quot;.

On 30 April 2019, Miliband joined Caroline Lucas and Laura Sandys in calling for a Green New Deal in the UK.

===Comments on other politicians===

During his time as Labour leader, Miliband criticised the Conservative Leader and Prime Minister David Cameron for &quot;sacrificing everything on the altar of deficit reduction&quot;, and has accused him of being guilty of practising &quot;old politics&quot;, citing alleged broken promises on areas such as crime, policing, bank bonuses, and child benefit.

Miliband was also particularly critical of former Liberal Democrat Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg following the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, accusing him of &quot;betrayal&quot; and of &quot;selling-out&quot; his party&#x27;s voters. In 2010, he stated that he would demand Clegg&#x27;s resignation before any Labour–Liberal Democrat coalition under his leadership. In the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum campaign he refused to share a platform with Clegg, stating that he had become &quot;too toxic&quot; a brand and that he would harm the &quot;Yes to AV&quot; campaign. He shared platforms during the campaign with former Liberal Democrat Leaders Lord Ashdown and Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Simon Hughes, the Green Party Leader Caroline Lucas and Business Secretary Vince Cable, among others. As Labour leader, Miliband made speeches aimed at winning over disaffected Liberal Democrats, identifying a difference between &quot;The Orange Book&quot; Lib Dems, who were closer to the Conservatives, and Lib Dems on the centre-left, offering the latter a role in helping Labour&#x27;s policy review at that time.Following the death of former Prime Minister and Conservative Leader Margaret Thatcher in 2013, Miliband spoke in a House of Commons sitting specially convened to pay tributes to her. He noted that, although he disagreed with a few of her policies, he respected &quot;what her death means to the many, many people who admired her&quot;. He also said that Thatcher &quot;broke the mould&quot; in everything she had achieved in her life, and that she had had the ability to &quot;overcome every obstacle in her path&quot;. He had previously praised Thatcher shortly before the Labour Party Conference in September 2012 for creating an &quot;era of aspiration&quot; in the 1980s.

Miliband has previously spoken positively of his brother David, praising his record as Foreign Secretary, and saying that &quot;his door was always open&quot; following David&#x27;s decision not to stand for the Shadow Cabinet in 2010. Upon David&#x27;s announcement in 2013 that he would resign as a Labour MP and move to New York to head the International Rescue Committee, Miliband said that British politics would be &quot;a poorer place&quot; without him, and that he thought David &quot;would once again make a contribution to British public life.&quot;

When asked to choose the greatest British Prime Minister, Miliband answered with Labour&#x27;s post-war Prime Minister and longest-serving Leader, Clement Attlee. He has also spoken positively of his two immediate predecessors as Labour leader, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, praising their leadership and records in government.

===Media portrayal===
Miliband was portrayed during Labour&#x27;s 2015 election campaign as being genuine in his desire to improve the lives of working people and to display progression from New Labour, but was unable to defeat interpretations of him as being ineffectual, or even cartoonish in nature. Political illustrators perceived a resemblance to Wallace of the British animation Wallace &amp; Gromit and greatly exaggerated this in caricatures; various images circulated in the press and online media of Miliband performing day-to-day activities such as eating a bacon sandwich, donating money to a beggar, and giving a kiss to his wife, all while displaying apparently awkward facial expressions. In a March 2015 &quot;Newsnight&quot; election debate, he was challenged by Jeremy Paxman as to whether or not he was &#x27;tough enough&#x27; to be Prime Minister, responding, &quot;Hell yes, I&#x27;m tough enough&quot;, in reference to his reluctance to support air strikes against extremist targets in Syria.

== Other works ==

In June 2017, Miliband guest-presented Jeremy Vine&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show.

Miliband co-hosts a popular podcast, entitled &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful&quot;, with radio presenter Geoff Lloyd. In November 2017, Miliband and Lloyd appeared as joint guests on Richard Herring&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast.

==Personal life==
Miliband is married to Justine Thornton, a High Court Judge. The couple met in 2002 and lived together in north London before becoming engaged in March 2010 and married in May 2011. They have two sons, Daniel, born 2009, and Samuel, born 2010.

Miliband is of Jewish heritage — the first ethnically Jewish leader of the Labour Party — and describes himself as a Jewish atheist. After marrying Thornton in a civil ceremony on 27 May 2011, he paid tribute to his Jewish heritage by following the tradition of breaking a glass. In 2012, Miliband wrote, &quot;Like many others from Holocaust families, I have a paradoxical relationship with this history. On one level I feel intimately connected with it – this happened to my parents and grandparents. On another, it feels like a totally different world.&quot;

<text>Untold Scandal (; &quot;Scandal: The Love Story of Men and Women in Joseon&quot;) is a 2003 South Korean historical romantic drama film directed by E J-yong, and starring Bae Yong-joon, Jeon Do-yeon, and Lee Mi-sook. Loosely based on the 1782 French novel &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, this adaptation takes place in late 18th century Korea, during the Joseon dynasty.

In South Korea, the film was given an R-18 rating by the Korean Film Ethics Commission. The film was a major commercial success, and became the fourth-highest-grossing domestic film of 2003 with 3,522,747 tickets sold nationwide.

== Plot ==
In the rigidly Confucian society of Joseon, where men are expected to embody the virtues of a gentleman and women the virtues of a chaste and devoted wife, Lady Cho defies expectations. A woman of extraordinary intelligence, she has mastered the Confucian classics despite the constraints placed upon her gender. Resentful of her imposed role, she outwardly performs the duties of a virtuous wife but secretly indulges in a dangerous game of seduction, asserting control over the very men who seek to control her. Her partner in this clandestine pursuit is her cousin, Jo-won, a gifted poet, painter, and martial artist who rejects the path of political ambition in favor of a hedonistic lifestyle, openly scorning the patriarchal values of the era. Though bound by an unspoken past, they maintain a delicate alliance in their mutual pursuit of conquest.

But their world of secret liaisons and whispered betrayals is upended when Lady Cho proposes a new challenge—corrupting her husband&#x27;s young concubine, the innocent and untouched So-ok. Yet Jo-won&#x27;s desires have already been captured by another: Lady Jeong, a widow revered for her chastity, who has remained faithful to her deceased husband for nine years and been awarded a &quot;yeolnyeomun&quot; (gate of virtuous women) for her devotion. Unlike his previous conquests, Lady Jeong is no easy prey. A devout Catholic and a woman of unwavering principles, she is as untouchable as she is alluring. Determined to break the unbreakable, Jo-won embarks on a relentless pursuit, setting the stage for a battle of wills between the era&#x27;s most notorious libertine and the most unyielding of virtuous women.

== Differences from the original novel ==
Monsieur de Tourvel (Madame de Tourvel / Lady Jeong&#x27;s husband), who was away for a court case in the novel, is deceased in the film, making Lady Jeong a widow of nine years. Furthermore, Lady Jeong lived in Ganghwa Island, but is sojourning in Seoul to avoid a plague in her hometown.

Jo-won (Vicomte de Valmont) and Lady Jo (Marquise de Merteuil) cousins are in the film (Jo-won being the younger cousin), and it is revealed that Jo-won&#x27;s first love was Lady Jo, whereas in the novel, they were former lovers and new rivals, yet using the same tools for their revenge: sex.

Marquise de Merteuil (Lady Jo)&#x27;s former lover, the Comte de Gercourt, is arranged to be Cécile&#x27;s future husband in the novel, while in the film, his character is attributed to Lady Jo&#x27;s husband. In So-ok&#x27;s case, she is being made into a concubine of Lady Jo&#x27;s husband for the continuity of the family lineage, with the elders&#x27; consent.

Lee So-ok (Cécile de Volanges) was ushered into Lady Jo&#x27;s care to be the concubine of her husband. Lady Jo is conspiring with Jo-won to make her pregnant for revenge, intending to reveal to truth to her husband on his deathbed.

Chevalier Danceny was originally Cécile&#x27;s music tutor in the novel, but in the film, Kwon In-ho is the youngest son of Lady Jo&#x27;s neighbour, and also Lady Jeong&#x27;s cousin.

<doc id="1290024" wikidata="Q7605371" url="?curid=1290024" title="Steam locomotives of Ireland">
<text>A wide variety of steam locomotives have been used on Ireland&#x27;s railways. This page lists most if not all those that have been used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Irish railways generally followed British practice in locomotive design.

The list that follows is roughly geographic (north to south) order.

==Northern Ireland==
The Ulster Transport Authority, which controlled the railways in Northern Ireland between 1948 and 1966, replaced steam haulage on passenger trains with diesel multiple units, but had only two diesel shunting locomotives, which meant a continued role for steam on freight work. Twenty-three locomotives passed to Northern Ireland Railways in 1967, but most were not used again and all had been withdrawn by 1971.

===Belfast and County Down Railway===
The Belfast and County Down Railway was founded in 1848. It absorbed the Belfast, Hollywood and Bangor Railway in 1884 and continued operating until it was nationalised in its centenary year into the Ulster Transport Authority as a result of the Ireland Act 1949. 
===Belfast and Northern Counties Railway (1848–1903) &amp; Northern Counties Committee (1903–1949)===

The Belfast and Northern Counties Railway (BNCR), was a railway that served the north-east of Ireland. It had its origins in the Belfast and Ballymena Railway that opened to traffic on 11 April 1848. The Northern Counties Committee came into existence on 1 July 1903 as the result of the Midland Railway taking over the BNCR. At the 1923 Grouping the Committee became part of the London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS); with the nationalisation of the railways in Britain in 1948 the line passed to the British Transport Commission and in the following year, 1949, it was sold to the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) as a result of the Ireland Act 1949.

;Belfast and Ballymena Railway (1848–1860) and other constituents
The early locomotives of the constituent companies were to assorted designs from a number of manufacturers. The first locomotives for the Belfast and Ballymena Railway were purchased from Bury, Curtis and Kennedy. These were four 2-2-2 singles and one 0-4-2 goods engine. Later, four more 2-2-2s were ordered but this time from Sharp Brothers. Fairbairn 2-2-2s were to be found on the Ballymena Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway but this company also favoured Sharp locomotives which were double framed 2-4-0s.

===Belfast and Northern Counties Railway (1860–1903)===
The BNCR introduced class letters for its locomotive stock in 1897. The MR (NCC) and later the LMS (NCC) continued to use the system adding new classes as required.

===Northern Counties Committee (1903–1949)===
==Cross-Border Lines==
Following the division of Ireland in 1921 into two administrations, a number of railways now found themselves operating on both sides of the newly created boundary between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State (later Republic of Ireland).

=== West Donegal Railway ===
The West Donegal Railway became the Donegal Railway in 1892; and the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee after being jointly acquired in 1906 by the Great Northern Railway and the Midland Railway&#x27;s Northern Counties Committee.
===Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway===
===Great Northern Railway===
The Great Northern Railway (GNR) was formed in 1876 acquiring a variety of locomotives. Nos 1 to 23 were from Dublin and Drogheda Railway; Nos. 24 to 41 from the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway; Nos. 43 to circa 78 from the Irish North Western Railway and Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway; Numbers in the eighties from the Newry and Armagh Railway and nos. 100 to 141 from the Ulster Railway. Later acquisitions in the 1880s from the Newry, Warrenpoint, and Rostrevor and the Belfast Central Railway were numbered in the Nineties. The GNR straddled the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland (after 1921), and so was not incorporated in either the CIÉ or Ulster Transport Authority. However, mounting losses saw the network purchased jointly by the Irish and British governments on 1 September 1953. It was run as a joint board, independent of the CIÉ and UTA, until 30 September 1958 when it was dissolved and the remaining stock split equally between the two railways.

;G. T. Glover (1912–1933)

;G. B. Howden (1933–1939)

;H. R. McIntosh (1939–1953)
===Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway===
;Broad gauge locomotives (1862–1882)

;Narrow gauge locomotives (1882–1954)
===Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway===
The Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway was a small cross-border railway that closed in 1957. Its locomotive fleet never carried numbers, only names.
==Irish Free State and Republic of Ireland==
The railways wholly in the Irish Free State were merged into one private company — Great Southern Railways — in 1925. The GSR renumbered all the broad gauge locomotives into one series with the former Great Southern and Western Railway locomotives retaining their old number. The GSR had two parallel classification systems – a numerical system which was the lowest number of a locomotive in that class, and an alpha-numerical which used a letter to indicate the wheel arrangement, and a number, with the lowest number given to the most powerful class with that wheel arrangement. The latter system was only used by Inchicore Works for accounting purposes, while the former was used by locomotive crews and the drawing office at Inchicore Works.

Note that narrow gauge locomotive classes included the letter N after the prefix letter, letter C was also used for Bo-Bo diesels, and that letters B, C, D, F, J, and K were used for the same wheel arrangements by the London and North Eastern Railway, while E and G changed places.

In 1945, the GSR became part of Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), which amalgamated the railway, road transport and canal functions of the State. CIÉ was nationalised in 1950 and settled on a policy of replacing steam with diesel locomotives, a process that was completed in 1962.

<text>Wendi Deng Murdoch (; born Deng Wen&#x27;ge; December 5, 1968) is a Chinese-born American entrepreneur and socialite. She was the third wife of media mogul Rupert Murdoch from 1999 until 2013.

==Early life and education==
Wendi Deng was born in Jinan, Shandong, and raised in Xuzhou, Jiangsu. Her birth name was Wen&#x27;ge Deng, (), meaning &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. She has two older sisters, and a brother, and both of her parents were engineers. When she was a teen she changed her given name to &quot;Wendi&quot;.

She attended Xuzhou First Secondary School (a.k.a. Xuzhou No.1 Middle School). She became a competitive volleyball player. While she was in high school, her father relocated to Guangzhou, where he was a factory director at the People&#x27;s Machinery Works; she and her family remained in Xuzhou until they joined their father a short time later. In 1985, she was enrolled at the Guangzhou Medical College.

In 1988, she left medical school and went to the United States on a study permit. She enrolled at California State University, Northridge, where she studied economics and was among the top scoring students. She obtained a BA in Economics from California State University at Northridge and an MBA from Yale University.

==Career and public profile==
Upon graduation from Yale in 1996, Deng met Bruce Churchill. At that time, Churchill oversaw finance and corporate development at the Fox TV branch in Los Angeles. He offered Deng an internship at News Corp subsidiary Star TV in Hong Kong, which developed into a full-time junior executive position. Though a junior employee, she took a role in working to plan Star TV&#x27;s operations in Hong Kong and China and helped to build up Chinese distribution for Star&#x27;s Channel V music channel. Within one year, she became a vice president. Additionally, she investigated interactive TV opportunities for News Digital Systems.

Deng was an advisor for MySpace&#x27;s China operation, prior to the company&#x27;s sale to Specific Media in June 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;chinaeconomicreview 2007/07/04&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; She led the Murdoch family&#x27;s Chinese internet investments and helped form business links with China for high-speed video and internet access.

In 2009, Deng co-founded the online platform Artsy with Carter Cleveland and Dasha Zhukova, which has since become one of the top online places for buying, viewing and learning about art. Other investors include Peter Thiel, François Pinault and Eric Schmidt.

In 2011, Deng co-produced her first film with Florence Sloan, &quot;Snow Flower and the Secret Fan&quot;, a movie about two footbound children in Qing dynasty China, directed by Wayne Wang. The film won the Golden Angel Award at the Chinese American Film Festival. She also produced the Netflix documentary &quot;Sky Ladder&quot; directed by Academy Award-winning Kevin MacDonald, showcasing the art of Cai Guo-Qiang. The film premiered in January 2016 at the Sundance Film Festival. Sotheby&#x27;s hosted a private reception and screening of the film in October 2016 before the film&#x27;s Netflix debut.

Deng is a collector of Chinese contemporary art. She has also invested in tech start-ups including Oscar, Snapchat, Uber, and Warby Parker.

== Personal life ==
Jake and Joyce Cherry hosted Deng in their home during her studies in the United States. Later, Jake Cherry left his wife, and married Deng in 1990. While married to Cherry, Wendi obtained a green card. They divorced after 2 years and 7 months of marriage. Jake later said that they stayed together for only four to five months when he learned that Deng was spending time with David Wolf, a man closer to her age. 

In 1997, she met media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who is 37 years her senior, while working as an executive at the Murdoch-owned Star TV in Hong Kong. They married in 1999 on board his yacht &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, less than three weeks after the finalization of his divorce from his second wife, Anna Murdoch (née Torv). The couple had two daughters: Grace (born 2001) and Chloe (born 2003). Tony Blair is Grace Murdoch&#x27;s godfather. In June 2013, Rupert Murdoch filed for divorce from Deng, citing irreconcilable differences.

On July 19, 2011, Deng counterattacked Jonathan May-Bowles (comedian Jonnie Marbles) after he threw a pie at her husband Rupert Murdoch while he was giving testimony before a British parliamentary committee considering the News International phone hacking scandal. May-Bowles was subsequently sentenced to six weeks&#x27; imprisonment.

In February 2014, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; alleged that Deng might have had an affair with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. An article in &quot;The Economist&quot; claimed that as a result of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s suspicion that Blair had an affair with his wife, he ended his long-standing association with Blair in 2014.

In early 2018, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published a story suggesting that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, longtime friends of Deng, were warned by US intelligence agencies that she may be using her relationship with them to further the goals of the Chinese government. Michael Wolff, author of &quot;Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House&quot;, posited that the article was an attempt by Rupert Murdoch, owner of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, to spread the idea that &quot;Wendi is a Chinese spy&quot; in the aftermath of their acrimonious divorce.

, Deng was living in New York City with her two daughters. Grace attends Yale University (class of 2025), and Chloe studies at Stanford (2026). Grace and Chloe are due to inherit shares in their father&#x27;s business interests, but they do not have voting rights, and are not involved in the September 2024 court case in which their half-siblings are challenging their father about changing the terms of a family trust which was set up as part of the divorce settlement between Rupert and his second wife Anna.

<text>James Boswell&#x27;s London Journal is a published version of the daily journal he kept between the years 1762 and 1763 while in London. Along with many more of his private papers, it was found in the 1920s at Malahide Castle in Ireland, and was first published in 1950, in an edition by Frederick A. Pottle. In it, Boswell, then a young Scotsman of 22, visits London for his second time. One of the most notable events in the journal is Boswell&#x27;s meeting on 16 May, 1763 Samuel Johnson, the famous writer, moralist, and lexicographer with whom Boswell would form a close relationship, eventually writing the biography &quot;The Life of Samuel Johnson.&quot;

The journal relates with much detail and candour his frequent and casual use of prostitutes. One of the more notorious events related is Boswell&#x27;s meeting his mistress Louisa, whom he believes has given him gonorrhea:

BOSWELL. Pray, Madam, in what state of health have you been in for some time?

LOUISA. Sir, you amaze me.

BOSWELL. I have but too strong, too plain reason to doubt of your regard. I have for some days observed the symptoms of disease, but was unwilling to believe you so very ungenerous. But now, Madam, I am thoroughly convinced.

LOUISA. Sir, you have terrified me. I protest I know nothing of the matter.

BOSWELL. Madam, I have had no connection with any woman but you these two months. I was with my surgeon this morning, who declared I had got a strong infection, and that she from whom I had it could not be ignorant of it. Madam, such a thing in this case is worse than from a woman of the town, as from her you may expect it. You have used me very ill. I did not deserve it. You know you said where there was no confidence, there was no breach of trust. But surely I placed some confidence in you. I am sorry that I was mistaken.

LOUISA. Sir, I will confess to you that about three years ago I was very bad. But for these fifteen months I have been quite well. I appeal to GOD Almighty that I am speaking true; and for these six months I have had to do with no man but yourself.

BOSWELL. But by G-D, Madam, I have been with none but you, and here am I very bad.

LOUISA. Well, Sir, by the same solemn oath I protest that I was ignorant of it.

BOSWELL. Madam, I wish much to believe you. But I own I cannot upon this occasion believe a miracle.

LOUISA. Sir, I cannot say more to you. But you will leave me in the greatest misery. I shall lose your esteem. I shall be hurt in the opinion of everybody, and in my circumstances.

BOSWELL (to himself). What the devil does the confounded jilt mean by being hurt in her circumstances? This is the grossest cunning. But I won&#x27;t take notice of that at all. — Madam, as to the opinion of everybody, you need not be afraid. I was going to joke and say that I never boast of a lady&#x27;s favours. But I give you my word of honour that you shall not be discovered.

LOUISA. Sir, this is being more generous than I could expect.
The &quot;London Journal&quot; was but one of various journals written by Boswell, now gathered into a number of published volumes, but it is the only one whose material had not undergone extensive familial expurgation in the 19th century, and so it retained the racy material that made the &quot;London Journal&quot; an astonishing best seller on its publication. Fundamentally an &quot;academic book,&quot; it sold over a million copies when it appeared as the first of the Yale Boswell publications in 1950. The manuscript was re-edited and comprehensively annotated in a new edition for Penguin Classics, by Gordon Turnbull, the general editor of the Yale Boswell Editions, in 2010.

<text>East Atlanta is a neighborhood on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The name East Atlanta Village primarily refers to the neighborhood&#x27;s commercial district.

== Geography ==
East Atlanta lies entirely within DeKalb County and is bounded by:

*Interstate 20, Edgewood and Kirkwood to the north.
*Moreland Avenue, and the neighborhoods of North Ormewood Park, Ormewood Park and Woodland Hills, to the west.
*Parts of unincorporated DeKalb County, such as Gresham Park Candler-McAfee Decatur, share borders with East Atlanta to the south and east.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Prior to the arrival of American colonists, the area had been dominated by the Creek Native American people. The Sandtown-Flat Shoals Trail existed along high ground as part of a trade route system between the Chattahoochee River and the coast. This trail would eventually become Flat Shoals Avenue. After the forcible removal of the Creek in the 1820s, American citizens began acquiring land in the area through the Georgia land lotteries.

=== Civil War ===

During the Civil War, Atlanta became a major supply hub of the southern war effort and a major target of the northern war effort. Lemuel P. Grant designed the city&#x27;s fortifications to protect his plantation on the eastside of the city in what is now Grant Park. General James B. McPherson placed his Yankee forces on high ground a mile east of Grant&#x27;s plantation, the area today known as East Atlanta.

A Union cannon was placed at the intersection of Glenwood Avenue and Flat Shoals Road to protect the flank of the front line. The Confederate forces were able to attack from behind, however. The Battle of Atlanta, which was part of the Atlanta Campaign and sealed the fate of the Confederacy, was fought in East Atlanta behind Union lines resulting in more than 12,000 deaths. Today many historic markers dot the neighborhood including two upturned cannons where Confederate General Walker and Union General McPherson were killed.

=== Reconstruction Era ===

East Atlanta recovered after the Civil War, quickly becoming a developing unincorporated town. The Marbut and Minor Mercantile Store was soon established at the crossroads of Glenwood Avenue and Flat Shoals Road. By the late 1890s, the store had grown to encompass five different businesses including a dry goods store, feed and seed, blacksmith, livery stable, and grocery store. Asa Candler, Joel Hurt, Frederic Patterson, and Aaron Haas, founders of the Metropolitan Streetcar Company, developed the McPherson Park subdivision to provide ridership for their electric streetcar line and housing for new store clerks in the area.

=== 20th Century ===

In 1905, lumber and railroad baron William Zuber built a large white columned frame mansion as a wedding present for his new bride on property that fronts Flat Shoals. The house is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The East Atlanta Banking Company entered the East Atlanta community in 1911, moving into its new building at Flat Shoals and Glenwood - shaped like an old fashioned &quot;flat iron&quot;. The building is now home to a bar (appropriately named &quot;Flatiron&quot;). A post office, a newspaper, a silent movie theatre and a carriage dealership were also added to the commercial district and Baptist and Methodist congregations in the area immediately began to grow.

The land to the south of Glenwood Avenue was owned by former Georgia Governor Joseph Emerson Brown. With Brown&#x27;s support, a grid of streets was planned around a public green space, a model for the &quot;urban utopian living&quot; that was being touted at the time. After 1915, in a series of votes, East Atlanta residents chose to be annexed into the city limits of Atlanta in order to gain access to fire protection and public education. Water and sewer service also enabled residents to enjoy indoor plumbing.

After World War II the undeveloped center of the neighborhood was subdivided and developed by the Williams brothers who were born and raised in East Atlanta and had built a lumber and concrete business nearby on Glenwood Avenue. As the residential area grew, nearby businesses prospered. The Madison Theatre talking picture show and a new public library were built with the help of public donations.

During the 1960s, East Atlanta was targeted by civil rights groups as an example of racial segregation of housing because members of the white-supremacy group Ku Klux Klan lived in an adjacent neighborhood. Under the protection of the Fair Housing Act, middle-class black families were assisted in efforts to purchase houses in the area. In response, many white families left the area, selling their homes for as low as $1,500 for a 3-bedroom home. Eventually, East Atlanta real estate was valued much lower than other areas of the city. The neighborhood&#x27;s appearance and reputation suffered as a result. In 1981, the East Atlanta Community Association was founded to bolster a sense of community in the neighborhood.

=== 21st Century ===

In 2005 East Atlanta acquired a new library building which is located at the corner of Flat Shoals and McPherson. That same year, the first phase of a public works project to enhance the pedestrian environment in the business district occurred. The result was much wider sidewalks and benches to sit on. In 2007 and 2008, the East Atlanta Village was voted &quot;Best Neighborhood&quot; in the city by readers of the Atlanta weekly newspaper &quot;Creative Loafing&quot;. Due to determined efforts by residents to improve their neighborhood and demand for affordable in-town housing, the average price of a house in East Atlanta has risen steadily since the late 1990s.

In 2017 the East Atlanta Community Association began efforts to include the neighborhood on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Culture ==
In recent decades, East Atlanta has seen a rise of street art. Many of East Atlanta&#x27;s murals were brought to the neighborhood by Living Walls and the Outerspace Project. Some of East Atlanta&#x27;s murals are easily visible from the street, but an equal number of murals are hidden in back parking lots, alleyways and behind buildings. Images and locations of East Atlanta&#x27;s murals are found on the Atlanta Street Art Map.

== Events ==

East Atlanta hosts a number of popular annual events, including:
* East Atlanta Strut - East Atlanta&#x27;s free annual one day neighborhood festival, always on the third Saturday in September featuring a parade, food, live music, art, and events. The festival is held to highlight the businesses in East Atlanta Village as well as raise funds for schools, senior programs and Neighbor In Need East Atlanta. The Festival is run completely with Volunteers. 
* B*ATL - Neighborhood festival commemorating the anniversary of the Civil War&#x27;s Battle of Atlanta, which was fought on July 22, 1864 on land that is now part of East Atlanta. Events include a period costume gala dinner and house tour; a 5K fun run; van and walking tours of neighborhood historic sites including Oakland Cemetery; Civil War Battle re-enactment featuring soldiers, live artillery, and civilian re-enactors; and historic music concerts. 
* East Atlanta Craft Beer Festival - Annual one day craft beer festival held the third weekend in May at Brownwood Park in East Atlanta, Georgia.

<doc id="1290057" wikidata="Q367713" url="?curid=1290057" title="Aniello Dellacroce">
<text>Aniello John &quot;Neil&quot; Dellacroce (March 15, 1914 – December 2, 1985) was an American mobster and underboss of the Gambino crime family of New York City. He rose to the position of underboss when Carlo Gambino moved Joseph Biondo aside. Dellacroce was a mentor to future Gambino boss John Gotti.

==Early life==
Dellacroce was born on March 15, 1914, in New York City to Francesco and Antoinette Dellacroce, first generation immigrants from Italy. He grew up in the Little Italy section of Manhattan. His nickname &quot;Neil&quot; was an Americanization of &quot;Aniello&quot;. Dellacroce had one brother, Carmine. Aniello was married to Lucille Riccardi. They had four children.

As a teenager, Dellacroce became a butcher&#x27;s assistant, but work was scarce and he took to crime. He was jailed once for petty theft. Dellacroce sometimes walked around Manhattan dressed as a priest and called himself &quot;Father O&#x27;Neil&quot; to confuse both the police and rival mobsters. Dellacroce allegedly committed a murder dressed as a priest. He also allegedly used a body double for some public events.

Aniello Dellacroce, which in Italian means &quot;little lamb of the cross&quot;, took pleasure in killing people. &quot;He likes to peer into a victim&#x27;s face, like some kind of dark angel, at the moment of death&quot;, according to a federal agent familiar with Dellacroce.

==Career==

In the late 1930s, Dellacroce joined the Mangano crime family, forerunner of the Gambino family, and soon became involved with underboss Albert Anastasia. After the disappearance of longtime boss Vincent Mangano, Anastasia became family boss and promoted Dellacroce to capo. Due to his square-shaped face, some Gambino members nicknamed him &quot;the Polack&quot;, a nickname never used within his earshot.

Dellacroce later became mentor to John Gotti. Dellacroce bought the Ravenite Social Club in Little Italy, which soon became a popular Gambino social club and Dellacroce&#x27;s headquarters. On October 25, 1957, gunmen murdered Anastasia in a Manhattan hotel barbershop. Carlo Gambino took over the family.

In 1965, Gambino removed the aging Joseph Biondo from his underboss position and appointed Dellacroce to replace him.

According to records from the Knapp Commission, which investigated police corruption in a number of industries beginning in 1970, Dellacroce and other mobsters were involved in after-hours bars that catered to homosexuals in the West Village, Manhattan.

In 1971, Dellacroce was sentenced to one year in state prison on contempt charges for refusing to answer grand jury questions about organized crime. On May 2, 1972, Dellacroce was indicted on federal tax evasion charges. In return for labor peace, the Yankee Plastics Company of New York gave Dellacroce 22,500 stock shares worth $112,500. He was indicted on a failure to pay federal income tax on these stocks. In March 1973, Dellacroce was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to five years in prison and fined $15,000.

On October 15, 1976, Carlo Gambino died at home of natural causes. Against expectations, he had appointed Paul Castellano to succeed him over his underboss Dellacroce. Gambino appeared to believe that his crime family would benefit from Castellano&#x27;s focus on white collar businesses. Dellacroce, at the time, was imprisoned for tax evasion and was unable to contest Castellano&#x27;s succession.

Castellano&#x27;s succession was confirmed at a meeting on November 24, with Dellacroce present. Castellano arranged for Dellacroce to remain as underboss while directly running traditional Cosa Nostra activities such as extortion, robbery, and loansharking. While Dellacroce accepted Castellano&#x27;s succession, the deal effectively split the Gambino family into two rival factions.

In 1979, he along with Anthony Plate, were arrested for the 1974 murder of a New York City bookmaker named Charles Calise. The FBI believed Dellacroce had ordered Plate to murder Calise because he was an informant. While on trial, Plate disappeared. The case ended in a mistrial.

On February 25, 1985, Dellacroce was indicted along with the leaders of the other New York Five Families as part of the Mafia Commission Trial. On March 28, 1985, Dellacroce, along with his son Armand and eight others, was indicted on federal racketeering charges regarding the activities of two crews in New York and Long Island. In June 1985, a Doonesbury comic featuring Frank Sinatra and Dellacroce together, and saying that Dellacroce was charged with the murder of Calise resulted in many papers not running the comic strip. On July 1, 1985, Dellacroce and the other New York Mafia leaders, pleaded not guilty to a second set of racketeering charges as part of the trial.

== Death ==
On December 2, 1985, Dellacroce died of cancer, aged 71, at Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens.

==Posthumous==
After Dellacroce&#x27;s death in 1985, Castellano revised his succession plan, appointing Thomas Bilotti as underboss and making plans to break up Gotti&#x27;s crew. Infuriated by both this and Castellano&#x27;s failure to attend Dellacroce&#x27;s wake, Gotti resolved to kill his boss.

A planned meeting of Castellano with other Gambino mobsters at Sparks Steak House on December 16, 1985 was chosen by Gotti as the opportunity to have him killed. When the boss and underboss arrived that evening, they were ambushed and shot dead by assassins under Gotti&#x27;s command. Gotti watched the hit from his car with Sammy Gravano.

In April 1988, Dellacroce&#x27;s son, Armond, died while hiding in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. He had been convicted of racketeering and had failed to appear for sentencing in March. The cause of death was listed as cirrhosis and a cocaine overdose.

In the TV movie &quot;Getting Gotti&quot; (1994), Dellacroce is portrayed by Peter Boretski. In the TV movie &quot;Gotti&quot; (1996), Dellacroce is portrayed by Anthony Quinn. In the TV movie &quot;Boss of Bosses&quot; (2001), he is portrayed by Dayton Callie. Stacy Keach portrays Dellacroce in the John Gotti biopic &quot;Gotti&quot; (2018), directed by Kevin Connolly and starring John Travolta as Gotti. In perhaps the film&#x27;s most memorable scene, Keach as Dellacroce teaches Travolta&#x27;s Gotti the names of the five boroughs of New York City. In the 2018 television series &quot;Kingpin&quot; (2018), Dellacroce is portrayed by Ralph Bracco.

<doc id="1290059" wikidata="Q2420523" url="?curid=1290059" title="Romanian Democratic Convention">
<text>The Romanian Democratic Convention (; abbreviated CDR) was an electoral alliance of several democratic, anti-communist, anti-totalitarian, and centre-right political parties in Romania, active from 1991 until 2000. The most prominent leaders of the CDR throughout the 1990s were by far Corneliu Coposu, Ion Rațiu, and Ion Diaconescu, all three members of the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚCD) - successor and political heir to the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ), active in the Kingdom of Romania between 1926 and 1948). 

The name of the CDR was coined by Sergiu Cunescu, the leader of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), as stated in an interview during the 1990s by former PNL re-founding president Radu Câmpeanu at &quot;Marius Tucă Show&quot; by talk show journalist Marius Tucă. An additional minor leader of the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR) was lawyer and MP Niculae Cerveni (who founded PNL-CD in 1992 and subsequently ran for president on behalf of PLDR in 2000).

== History ==

=== Political composition ===

The core members of the CDR included the following political parties:

* Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚCD): (1991–2001);
* Ecologist Federation of Romania (FER): (1991–2001);
* Romanian Ecologist Party (PER): (1991–2000);
* Civic Alliance Party (PAC): (1991–1995);
* Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR): (1991–1995);
* Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ): (1991–1992, 1992–1995);
* National Liberal Party (PNL): (1991–1992, 1993–1999);
* National Liberal Party-Democratic Convention (PNL-CD): (1992–1997);
* National Liberal Party-Youth Wing (PNL-AT): (1992–1993);
* Liberal Party &#x27;93 (PL ’93): (1993–1995);
* Union of Right-leaning Forces (PAR, then UFD): 1996–2001;
* National Christian Democratic Alliance (ANCD): (1999–2001);
* The Moldavians&#x27; Party (PM): (1999–2001).

Eventually, some parties left (more specifically, the main faction of the PNL between 1992 and 1996, as well as the PAC, PSDR, and UDMR/RMDSZ in 1995), while other minor parties joined or were created between mergers within the alliance such as the Liberal Party &#x27;93 (PL &#x27;93) or the Union of Right-leaning Forces (UFD).

=== 1991–1992: Foundation ===

CDR was founded in 1991, one year before the 1992 elections, mainly by the PNȚCD and the National Liberal Party (PNL). In addition, aside from the aforementioned political forces, several other noteworthy civic and cultural organisations, foundations, and other minor political parties were involved in the foundational process.

Initially, the planned name of the CDR was &quot;The National Convention for Democracy Implementation&quot; (). Subsequently, the main purpose of the CDR was to amount an effective opposition against the then all-dominating National Salvation Front (FSN), a huge parliamentary bloc made up mostly of former second and third rank members of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), which assumed leadership of the country shortly after the 1989 Revolution. According to a later interview by Emil Constantinescu, the former President of Romania claimed that the FSN was actually made of former first rank members of the PCR.

=== 1992–1996: Opposition ===

For the period 1992–1996, CDR was the main political opposition force in the Parliament of Romania and in the local administration as well. Although the convention won the capital city of Bucharest and much of the larger urban centres at the 1992 local elections, FSN swept over almost all rural areas and small towns.

The alliance also included the UDMR/RMDSZ, which ran on a separate list, and a number of minor parties and civic organisations that failed to gain parliamentary representation: the Democratic Unity Party, the Christian Democratic Union, the Ecologist Federation of Romania (FER), the Civic Alliance (PAC), and others. Prior to the 1992 general elections, the PNL led by Radu Câmpeanu withdrew from the CDR.

At the 1992 general elections, Emil Constantinescu was the presidential candidate of the convention. He managed to qualify in the second round where he finished second with an electoral score of 38.57% (or 4,641,207 votes).

===1996–2000: Government===

In 1993, the PNL led by Mircea Ionescu-Quintus returned within the CDR. Subsequently, the CDR managed to win the 1996 Romanian elections, and the alliance&#x27;s presidential candidate, once again Emil Constantinescu, became president with 54.41% (or 7,057,906 votes). The 1996 Romanian general election represented the first peaceful transition of power in the democratic history of Romania after the fall of Communism.

For the period 1996–2000, the CDR formed a grand coalition with the Social Democratic Union (an alliance between the Democratic Party and PSDR) and the UDMR/RMDSZ (Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania). At governing level, this grand coalition resulted in the Ciorbea Cabinet (1996–1998), Vasile Cabinet (1998–1999), and Isărescu Cabinet (1999–2000).

===2000–2004: CDR 2000 and extra-parliamentary opposition===

Due to internal frictions within the alliance (as well as given the somewhat inconsistent and turbulent governing from 1996 to 2000), the PNL decided to withdraw from the CDR prior to the 2000 general elections. Nonetheless, PNȚCD and other parties ran on the CDR 2000 common list for these elections. The alliance did not manage to score the same positive results as it did during the 1990s and, consequently, shortly disbanded since it did not pass the electoral threshold. However, it expressed extra-parliamentary opposition between 2000 and 2004 towards the minority PDSR government led by Adrian Năstase.

== Presidents and notable leaders ==

* Corneliu Coposu (PNȚCD, early to mid 1990s);
* Ion Rațiu (PNȚCD, early 1990s);
* Ion Diaconescu (PNȚCD, early to late 1990s);
* Emil Constantinescu (PNȚCD, late 1990s);
* Radu Câmpeanu (PNL, only during the early 1990s);
* Mircea Ionescu-Quintus (PNL, mid to late 1990s);
* Niculae Cerveni (PNL, early 1990s, PNL-CD early to late 1990s);
* Géza Domokos (UDMR/RMDSZ, early 1990s);
* György Frunda (UDMR/RMDSZ, mid 1990s to late 1990s);
* Sergiu Cunescu (PSDR, early to mid 1990s);
* Otto Weber (PER, early to late 1990s);
* Marcian Bleahu (FER, early to late 1990s).

As of mid 2023, of all the aforementioned leaders of the CDR, only Constantinescu and Frunda are still alive.

<text>The Unstrut ( or ) is a river in Germany and a left tributary of the Saale.

The Unstrut originates in northern Thuringia near Dingelstädt (west of Kefferhausen in the Eichsfeld area) and its catchment area is the whole of the Thuringian Basin. It breaks out of the basin through the Thuringian Gate west of Heldrungen and, in its lower reaches, flows through Saxony-Anhalt before emptying into the Saale near Naumburg. The total length of the Unstrut is . Towns along the Unstrut include Mühlhausen, Sömmerda, Bad Frankenhausen, Artern, Roßleben, and Freyburg.
The main tributaries of the Unstrut are the Gera, Wipper, Helme, and Lossa.

The countryside around the Saale and Unstrut rivers forms the wine-growing region of Saale-Unstrut. The well-known brand of sparkling wine, &quot;Rotkäppchen&quot; (&quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;) is produced in the cellars of Freyburg.

==Name==
Old High German &quot;Strödu&quot; means &#x27;boggy thicket&#x27; and &quot;un-&quot; is a prefix to intensify the meaning, and so the Unstrut region was a very swampy area.
In 575, the river was attested as the &quot;Onestrudis&quot;, in the 7th century it was referred to as the &quot;Unestrude&quot;, and in 994 as the &quot;Vnstruod&quot;.

==History==
In 531, according to the &quot;Decem Libri&quot; of Gregory of Tours, the decisive Battle of the Unstrut River between the Franconians and Thuringians took place along the Unstrut, which resulted in the destruction and annexation of the early medieval Thuringian kingdom by the Frankish empire. In 933 the German king Henry I fought, after a ten-year truce, against a Hungarian army in the Battle of Riade, a place near the Unstrut, but which is now unknown. His victory led to a period of peace, until the Hungarians returned in 955 and were defeated again.
One of his favourite places was Memleben on the Unstrut, where a royal residence, a so-called &quot;Pfalz&quot;, &quot;palatium&quot; or &quot;villa regia&quot;, was built. He died there in 936, as did his son, Otto I, in 973. A monastery was built there in the next years, becoming one of the most important in the German realm for a short time. Its ruins may still be seen; the exact location of the &quot;palatium&quot; is not known any more.

Due to its marshy character, the Unstrut was not navigable for ships for a long time. Finally, in the years 1790–94, the river was made navigable on the orders of the Elector of Saxony. It became an important shipping lane for a century; in particular, sandstone and limestone were shipped. From 1889, when the Unstrut Railway (&quot;Unstrutbahn&quot;), was built alongside the river, the significance of the waterway as a transport route was much reduced. 
Although the Unstrut wine-growing region, with an area of , is one of the smallest, it is quite well known.

<doc id="1290072" wikidata="Q3973369" url="?curid=1290072" title="Steve McClure">
<text>Steve McClure (born 25 July 1970) is a British rock climber and climbing author, who is widely regarded as Britain&#x27;s leading and most important sport climber for a period that extends for over two decades, starting from the late 1990s. In 2017, he created &quot;Rainman&quot;, Britain&#x27;s first-ever sport route, and by that stage was responsible for developing the majority of routes graded and above in Britain. Although mainly known for sport climbing, McClure has also been one of the most successful British traditional climbers, and British onsight climbers (in both sport climbing and traditional climbing formats).

== Climbing career==
McClure started climbing early as both parents were keen climbers, and by age 16 was onsighting E6. McClure did not take up British sport climbing until he was 24, and said that it took him time to adapt saying, &quot;[in sport] it&#x27;s possible to commit 100%, rather than considering the risk and the danger [in traditional]&quot;. He went from onsighting E6 to onsighting ; within one year was doing redpoints in a day; within 2 years he was doing ; within 4 years, at age 28, he was doing . As a late-comer to sport climbing, McClure had mixed form in competitions, retiring in 2004.

For the next two decades, McClure dominated British sport climbing, repeating the hardest routes of his predecessors such as Ben Moon&#x27;s &quot;Hubble&quot; (8c+/9a), and Jerry Moffatt&#x27;s &quot;Evolution&quot; (8c+), and developing Britain&#x27;s first 9a routes. In 1998, he created &quot;Mutation&quot;, at the time Britain&#x27;s second ; but on its first repeat 23 years later was regraded to , Britain&#x27;s first 9a+. In 2000, he freed Britain&#x27;s third , Ben Moon&#x27;s &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. In 2007, McClure created Britain&#x27;s second route, &quot;Overshadow&quot;. In June 2017, aged 46, McClure completed long term project &quot;Rainman&quot;, Britain&#x27;s first-ever , with &quot;PlanetMountain&quot; saying: &quot;Steve McClure is the climber who almost single-handedly has dictated the pace of cutting-edge sport climbing in the UK. Practically all the hardest climbs in the country are his, starting in 1998 with his 9a Mutation at Ravens Tor&quot;.

While McClure is best known for sport climbing, he is one of the few who have repeated the hardest traditional climbing routes in Britain, including Dave MacLeod&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (E11 7a, 5.14c R/X) in 2008, and Neil Gresham&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon&quot; (E11 7a, 5.14a R) in 2021. He has also freed projects such as &quot;GreatNess Wall&quot; (E10 7a), in 2019. On traditional climbing risk, he had said: &quot;Routes like &quot;Harder Faster&quot;, &quot;Indian Face&quot;, &quot;The Bells The Bells&quot; and &quot;Meshuga&quot; just fill me with dread, and I have absolutely no drive to do them at all.&quot;, and, &quot; I like the technical challenge of placing gear, but I&#x27;m not interested in death routes&quot;.

McClure is also known for onsighting routes, and in 2002, became the first British climber to onsight an with &quot;Indian Summer&quot; at Kilnsey (he has since onsighted more routes at 8b+, such as &quot;Tom et je Ris&quot;, in Verdon in 2013). In 2009, he was unlucky not to become the first British climber to onsight an failing at the final move of &quot;Amistad&quot; in Rodellar, Spain. In 2019, McClure made the first onsight of &quot;Nightmayer&quot; (E8 6c), one of the hardest onsights of a traditional climb in Britain, and in 2021, he flashed &quot;Impact Day&quot; (E8 6c). McClure&#x27;s first British onsight of Ron Fawcett&#x27;s &quot;Strawberries&quot; (E7 6b) in 2014, was also notable.

In 2013, McClure became the first-ever British nominee for a Salewa Rock Award at the 2013 &quot;Arco Rock Legends&quot;, and a citation calling him: &quot;a true legend of this sport and his nomination rewards a lifetime of cutting-edge climbing&quot;; the four nominees were Steve McClure, Chris Sharma, Alex Megos, and Adam Ondra (who won).
