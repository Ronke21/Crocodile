<text>Insular script is a medieval script system originating in Ireland that spread to England and continental Europe under the influence of Irish Christianity. Irish missionaries took the script to continental Europe, where they founded monasteries, such as Bobbio. The scripts were also used in monasteries, like Fulda, which were influenced by English missionaries. They are associated with Insular art, of which most surviving examples are illuminated manuscripts. It greatly influenced modern Gaelic type and handwriting.

The term &quot;Insular script&quot; is used to refer to a diverse family of scripts used for different functions. At the top of the hierarchy was the Insular half-uncial (or &quot;Insular majuscule&quot;), used for important documents and sacred text. The full uncial, in a version called &quot;English uncial&quot;, was used in some English centres. Then &quot;in descending order of formality and increased speed of writing&quot; came &quot;set minuscule&quot;, &quot;cursive minuscule&quot; and &quot;current minuscule&quot;. These were used for non-scriptural texts, letters, accounting records, notes, and all the other types of written documents.

==Origin==
The scripts developed in Ireland in the 7th century and were used as late as the 19th century, though its most flourishing period fell between 600 and 850. They were closely related to the uncial and half-uncial scripts, their immediate influences; the highest grade of Insular script is the majuscule Insular half-uncial, which is closely derived from Continental half-uncial script.

==Appearance==

Works written in Insular scripts commonly use large initial letters surrounded by red ink dots (although this is also true of other scripts written in Ireland and England). Letters following a large initial at the start of a paragraph or section often gradually diminish in size as they are written across a line or a page, until the normal size is reached, which is called a &quot;diminuendo&quot; effect, and is a distinctive Insular innovation, which later influenced Continental illumination style. Letters with ascenders (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, etc.) are written with triangular or wedge-shaped tops. The bows of letters such as &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;q&quot; are very wide. The script uses many ligatures and has many unique scribal abbreviations, along with many borrowings from Tironian notes.

Insular script was spread to England by the Hiberno-Scottish mission; previously, uncial script had been brought to England by Augustine of Canterbury. The influences of both scripts produced the Insular script system.
Within this system, the palaeographer Julian Brown identified five grades, with decreasing formality:
*Insular half-uncial, or &quot;Irish majuscule&quot;: the most formal; became reserved for rubrics (highlighted directions) and other displays after the 9th century.
*Insular hybrid minuscule: the most formal of the minuscules, came to be used for formal church books when use of the &quot;Irish majuscule&quot; diminished.
*Insular set minuscule
*Insular cursive minuscule
*Insular current minuscule: the least formal; &quot;current&quot; here means ‘running’ (rapid).
Brown has also postulated two phases of development for this script, Phase II being mainly influenced by Roman uncial examples, developed at Wearmouth-Jarrow and typified by the Lindisfarne Gospels.

==Usage==
Insular script was used not only for Latin religious books, but also for every other kind of book, including vernacular works. Examples include the Book of Kells, the Cathach of St. Columba, the Ambrosiana Orosius, the Durham Gospel Fragment, the Book of Durrow, the Durham Gospels, the Echternach Gospels, the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Lichfield Gospels, the St. Gall Gospel Book, and the Book of Armagh.

Insular script was influential in the development of Carolingian minuscule in the scriptoria of the Carolingian empire.

In Ireland, Insular script was superseded in by Late Insular script; in England, it was followed by a form of Caroline minuscule.

The Tironian , equivalent of ampersand was in widespread use in the script (meaning &#x27;and&#x27; in Irish, and &#x27;and&#x27; in Old English) and is occasionally continued in modern Gaelic typefaces derived from Insular script.

==Unicode==
Unicode treats representation of letters of the Latin alphabet written in insular script as a typeface choice that needs no separate coding. Only a few Insular letters have specific code-points because they are used by phonetic specialists. To render the full alphabet correctly, a suitable display font should be chosen. To display the specialist characters, there are several fonts that may be used; three free ones that support these characters are Junicode, Montagel, and Quivira. Gentium and Charis SIL support the alphabetic letters (U+A77x and U+A78x).

According to Michael Everson, in the 2006 Unicode proposal for these characters:

<text>The Mitch Daniels School of Business (formerly known as Krannert School of Management) is the school of business at Purdue University, a public research university in West Lafayette, Indiana. It offers instruction at the undergraduate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels.
==History==

The School of Industrial Management at Purdue University was created in 1958 from the merger of the Department of Economics (established in the School of Science, Education, and Humanities in 1953) and the Department of Industrial Management and Transportation (part of the Schools of Engineering since 1956). The Krannert Graduate School of Industrial Administration was founded in 1962 with a $2.7 million endowment from Herman Krannert and Ellnora Krannert. The AACSB accredited the new school in 1967. In the early years, students were required to pursue a second major, in a technical subject, in addition to their coursework in business and management. The curriculum expanded over the following decade and the word &quot;Industrial&quot; was dropped from the schools&#x27; names in the mid 1970s.

On February 3, 2023, Purdue’s business school was formally named the Mitch Daniels School of Business, in honor of Mitch Daniels, the 12th president of Purdue University. Purdue&#x27;s business school is accredited by the AACSB.

==Academics==

The school currently has 20+ clubs and organizations open to undergraduates, including the School of Management Council (SMC). There are ~25 professional, cultural and special interest clubs at the graduate level.

The Mitch Daniels School of Business differentiates itself from similarly sized business programs by providing an emphasis on a STEM-focused, data-driven education. All degrees awarded are Bachelors of Science.

===Undergraduate: Bruce White Undergraduate Institute===
On February 13, 2023, the Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation committed $50 million to Purdue University to name the undergraduate institute in the Mitch Daniels School of Business. The School of Business offers nine undergraduate degree programs. In keeping with the global scope of the modern manager, all programs include instruction in the international aspects of business and a strong technical background in engineering, data science, and quantitative reasoning skills. The Daniels School also offers qualified students a pipeline to any of their many specialized 1-year masters programs, allows students to complete their B.S. and an MS, Master of Business Administration (MBA), or their industry-leading Master of Business Technology (MBT) degree in just five years.

===Master&#x27;s and executive: Krannert Graduate Institute===
The Krannert Graduate Institute at the Daniels School of Business awards several master&#x27;s degrees: MBA, EMBA, International Masters in Management, Master of Science in Human Resource Management, Master of Science in Industrial Administration, Master of Science in Finance, Master of Science in Global Entrepreneurship, Master of Science in Global Supply Chain Management and a Weekend MBA. These programs are housed in Rawls Hall. The school also offers a variety of joint programs with other colleges on campus including the combined Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) and Master of Science in Industrial Administration (MSIA), the combined Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering (BSIE) and Master of Business Administration (MBA), and the combined Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) and Master of Business Administration (MBA)

In 2020, despite tight alumni classes and a well respected curriculum the School of Business was forced to pause its full time residential MBA program.

===Doctoral===
The School of Business&#x27;s Doctoral Programs offer students the opportunity to work closely with first-rate faculty in the areas of Economics, Management (with concentrations in Accounting, Finance, Management Information Systems, Marketing, Operations Management, Quantitative Methods/Management Science, and Strategic Management), and Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Resource Management (OBHR).
The School of Business&#x27;s doctoral programs were ranked #23 in the world for 2009 and #25 for 2013 by &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

===Department of Economics===
The Department of Economics at Purdue University is located at Daniels School of Business and offers undergraduate, master&#x27;s, and PhD in economics. The department has the following centers - Purdue Center for Economic Education, Purdue University Research Center in Economics, Purdue Center for Behavioral Economics, Experiments and Public Policy and also Vernon Smith Experimental Economics Laboratory.

==Facilities==
The school&#x27;s facilities are located on the southeastern part of Purdue&#x27;s West Lafayette campus near the Purdue Memorial Union. The majority of undergraduate classes are conducted in the Krannert Building, which opened in 1964. Rawls Hall is the home of all the classes in the Masters program. Rawls Hall houses 13 electronically equipped classrooms, a professional career center, a multimedia-based auditorium, 25 breakout rooms, distance learning facilities, and sophisticated computer labs. The building is named for business master&#x27;s alum, Jerry S. Rawls. Rawls, the president and chief executive officer of Finisar Corp., donated $10 million to the Krannert at the Frontier Campaign. The gift was the largest in the school&#x27;s history and one of the largest at Purdue. In recognition of his generosity, the Purdue Board of Trustees voted in 2000 to name the new facility Jerry S. Rawls Hall. The Jerry Rawls Hall was dedicated on October 2, 2003. In September 2022, Purdue announced the approval of $168 million in funding to construct a new state-of-the-art business building that will be built to hold the increase in students and faculty with an estimated completion of 2026. Upon completion, the new facility will be the most expensive building ever constructed on Purdue&#x27;s West Lafayette campus.

<doc id="1273678" wikidata="Q7748599" url="?curid=1273678" title="The Lost Crown of Queen Anne">
<text>The Lost Crown of Queen Anne is a text-based adventure computer game written by Robert Wayne Atkinsfor the Commodore 64 and MS-DOS and is a part of the &quot;Classic Adventure Series&quot;. It was also included on &quot;Big Blue Disk&quot; #28 and &quot;Loadstar&quot; #57.

In the game, the player must find Queen Anne&#x27;s crown. In the game&#x27;s fictional plot, the crown went missing shortly after the Queen&#x27;s death in 1714, and was last known to be in the possession of a Sheikh in the Arabian Desert.

==Plot==
The game begins in the Arabian Desert, where the player&#x27;s camel has gone lame, and they are out of food and water. Throughout the game, the player must avoid starvation, dehydration, poison traps, and other dangers. The game ends when the player either finds the crown, or dies.

Certain elements of the game are randomized. Although text-based, the screen is split into a map, area description, and inventory of items. At the bottom of the screen are statistics such as hunger, thirst, number of treasures found, total moves, and score.

==Legacy==
The game was made available by the developer (together with the other games of his career) for download free of charge in 2003.

<text>Pars Khodro () is an Iranian automobile manufacturer. It was the first manufacturer of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in Iran.

==History==
Formerly, Pars Khodro built American Motors&#x27; Rambler and General Motors (GM) products under licence. Its first cars, the Aria and the Shahin, were based on AMC&#x27;s compact 1966 Rambler American and were launched in 1967. Production ended in 1974. It also built Jeep CJ, Jeep Wagoneer and Jeep Gladiator models under licence. The company was called Sherkat-Sahami Jeep at that time.
In June 1972, Sherkat-Sahami signed a deal with GM and formed General Motors Iran Ltd. GM Iran produced the Opel Commodore under licence from 1974 until 1976, with &quot;Chevrolet Royale&quot; badging. These models featured 2.5- and 2.8-litre engines. After having developed a reputation for reliability problems, the Royale was replaced on the Iranian production lines by the Buick Skylark (&quot;Buick Iran&quot;), Cadillac Seville (&quot;Cadillac Iran&quot;) and Chevrolet Nova, along with a Chevrolet pick-up truck. The Jeep continued during this time. These were built until 1981, the Iranian Revolution forcing the cessation of their manufacture and links with GM.

Afterward, Pars Khodro switched to the manufacture of the Nissan Patrol and pickups under licence. The last Patrol was produced in 2002.

In 1995, Pars Khodro acquired an additional Renault 5 assembly line from SAIPA. SAIPA is a fellow Iranian manufacturer who had been making the car since 1976 as a replacement for the Iranian-built Citroën Dyane. The Sepand I and II were versions of the original Renault 5, succeeded by a widened version with Kia Pride underpinnings, called the Sepand PK.

In 2000, 51 per cent of Pars Khodro&#x27;s shares were purchased by SAIPA, which in turn is 48 per cent owned by the Iranian Government.
==Today&#x27;s range==
Pars Khodro has built Renault and Nissan models under licence. Nissan models include the Maxima, Roniz (Xterra), Teana, Patrol, and Safari.

From 2006, Pars Khodro began to manufacture the Dacia Logan, Dacia Sandero and Renault Mégane under license, with the Logan being built in a joint-venture with Renault until 2018 as the Renault Tondar 90.

At the moment, only the SAIPA Renault Pars Tondar (an updated local version of the Tondar 90
), Pars Khodro H220, Pars Khodro H230, Pars Khodro H320, Pars Khodro Haise and Pars Khodro H330 are being sold. (Production stopped due to US sanctions on Iran)

Michael Fay (born September 1956, Plainfield, New Jersey) is an American ecologist and conservationist notable for, among other things, the MegaTransect, in which he spent 455 days walking 2,000 miles (3,200 km) across Africa and the MegaFlyover in which he and pilot Peter Ragg spent months flying 70,000 miles in a small plane at low altitude, taking photographs every twenty seconds. Both projects were sponsored by the National Geographic Society, which produced articles and documentaries about the projects.

==Biography==
Fay graduated in 1978 from the University of Arizona, and then joined the Peace Corps working in Tunisia and the Central African Republic. In 1984 he joined the Missouri Botanical Garden. He completed his doctorate on the western lowland gorilla in 1997, while also surveying large forest blocks by aeroplane and working to create and manage the Dzanga-Sangha park and the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park in the Central African Republic and Republic of the Congo. He has worked for the Wildlife Conservation Society since 1990, and was an Explorer in Residence at the National Geographic Society. 

In 2006, Fay and &quot;National Geographic&quot; photographer Michael Nichols traveled to Zakouma National Park to document the danger poachers create for the world&#x27;s largest remaining concentration of elephants. Their trip resulted in &quot;Ivory Wars, Last Stand in Zakouma&quot;. He has testified before the United States Congress on the need for preservation of wildlife and habitat.

As of 2022, he is working on conservation projects in Gabon with the Agence Nationale Des Parcs Nationaux.

<text>António José de Almeida, (; 27 July 1866 – 31 October 1929), was a Portuguese politician who served as the sixth president of Portugal from 1919 to 1923.

==Early career==

Born in Penacova to José António de Almeida and his wife Maria Rita das Neves, Almeida studied medicine at the University of Coimbra and became a medical doctor. During his term as Minister for the Interior, he was the founder of both the University of Lisbon and the University of Porto in 1911. He was one of the most eloquent republican tribunes, and, after the 5 October 1910 revolution, as interior minister he led the moderate wing of the Portuguese Republican Party, that opposed Afonso Costa. The moderates elected Manuel de Arriaga for first elected President, on 24 August 1911, defeating Afonso Costa&#x27;s candidate, Bernardino Machado.

António José de Almeida founded his own party, the Evolutionist Party, that was in the opposition. On 12 June 1916 he became Minister for Finance and also Prime Minister of Portugal. Later, both the Evolutionist Party and the Republican Union, Manuel de Brito Camacho&#x27;s party, joined to form the new Republican Liberal Party, in 1919, that went on to win the legislative elections.

==Presidency==
On 6 August 1919, António José de Almeida was elected the 6th President of the Republic, and was the only President of the First Republic, that completed the full four years mandate. He faced the greatest political instability of the regime and almost resigned. He was also remembered for his voyage to Brazil, in 1922, during the centennial of that country&#x27;s independence from Portugal, where he was noted as a brilliant speaker.

==Personal life==
He married on 14 December 1910 to Maria Joana de Morais Perdigão Queiroga, daughter with her younger sisters Antónia and Catarina of Joaquim José Perdigão Queiroga (b. Évora) and first wife Maria Cândida de Morais and half-sister of Perdigão Queiroga. On 27 December 1911 they had an only daughter Maria Teresa Queiroga de Almeida, married to medical doctor Júlio Gomes da Cunha de Abreu.

==Honours==
* Sash and Grand-Cross of the Three Orders, as President of the Republic and Grand-Master of the Portuguese Honorific Orders (1919–1923)
* Grand-Cross of the Order of the Tower and of the Sword, of Valour, Loyalty and Merit, Portugal (July 10, 1919)
* Grand-Cross of the Order of Christ, Portugal (October 16, 1919)
* Grand-Cross of the Order of Aviz, Portugal (October 16, 1919)
* Grand-Cross of the Order of Saint James of the Sword, Portugal (October 16, 1919)

<text>SAIPA (, &quot;SAIPA&quot;) is an Iranian automaker headquartered in Tehran. The SAIPAC (an acronym for the French &quot;Société anonyme iranienne de production des automobiles Citroën&quot; lit. &quot;Iranian Limited Company for the Production of Citroën Automobiles&quot;) was established in 1965 as with 75% Iranian ownership, to assemble Citroëns under license for the Iranian market. It changed its name into SAIPA (&quot;Société anonyme iranienne de production automobile&quot;) in 1975 when Citroën withdrew from the company. Its products in recent years have been mostly under-licensed Korean cars and its own engine and range of cars. The chief executive (president or managing director) of SAIPA is Ali Sheikhzadeh.

The main subsidiaries of SAIPA Group are Saipa Diesel, Pars Khodro and Zamyad Co.

==History==
SAIPA began by assembling Citroën&#x27;s two-cylinder mini car, the Dyane, in 1968. It went under the name Jyane (or Jian) in Iran. SAIPA built 120,000 Jyane models.

There was also a glazed panel van version of the Jyane, as well as the Baby-Brousse, a rustic little buggy in the style of a Citroën Méhari but with a metal body. Later, a pickup version of the Jyane also appeared. The Baby-Brousse was built from 1970 until 1979. In 1975 Saipa began manufacturing licensed versions of the original Renault 5 and later the Renault 21. Production of Citroëns ended in 1980.

From 1986 to 1998 SAIPA built the Z24 pickup, a license-built version of the 1970-1980 Nissan Junior with a 2.4-litre engine. In 1998 SAIPA took over the Zamyad company, which then undertook the production of the Z24. Since 2003, this truck has been sold under the Zamyad brand.

Renault 5 production ended in 1994 (Pars Khodro took over the production lines) and the 21 was discontinued in 1997. In 1993 a relationship with KIA began, and production of the Kia Pride commenced. SAIPA&#x27;s Pride is marketed under the names Saba (saloon) and Nasim (hatchback). At the 2001 Tehran Motor Show the liftback Saipa 141 was added to the lineup. This is a five-door version based on the Saba and is somewhat longer than the Nasim. The Pride series cars carry 97% local content. From 2001 to late 2010, SAIPA produced the Citroën Xantia under license. Sedan models of the previous generation Kia Rio were assembled using parts imported from Korea from May 2005 to late 2012, when SAIPA lost its license to produce them.

In 2000, SAIPA launched its own design, the 701 Caravan minivan, face-lifted in 2003.

In 2002, a lift-back version of the Saba was introduced as the 141. Models 132 debuted in 2007 and 111 in 2009. The Iran-made &quot;SAIPA National Engine 231&quot; was introduced in November 2008.

In December 2008, the Tiba/Miniator debuted the Tiba with a 4-cylinder gas engine and ABS, averaging 7 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers and putting out with a displacement of 1,500 cc. The price quoted at the time of its launch was less than 100 million rials (US$10,000). The car was designed in country and produced with the services of some 122 local manufacturers. 15,000 Tiba were to be produced in 2009. Production over the succeeding three years was to reach 200,000 per year by a new subsidiary, Kashan SAIPA. The Tiba is expected to replace the Kia Pride. The share of Tiba/Miniator in SAIPA&#x27;s exports will be about 20 percent by 2011. The model was originally named Miniator but was later changed to Tiba (gazelle).

In 2012, a pick-up version of the SAIPA Pride was introduced as the 151.

In 2015, the company began the production of cars derived from Chinese manufacturers.

In 2019, it was reported in the press that the SAIPA Quik was due to be assembled by an African firm as the Mureza Prim8 in Rosslyn, South Africa, with the company hoping to start production at the Willowvale Motor Industries plant in Zimbabwe in the following years.

==Pars Khodro acquisition ==

In 2000, SAIPA purchased 51% of Pars Khodro, where it manufactured the Citroën C5.

Since 2018, Pars Khodro has mainly assembled a range of Chinese models, but other products include the SAIPA Renault Pars Tondar, an updated locally built version of the first-generation Dacia Logan, which used to be assembled by SAIPA and its subsidiary Pars Khodro in a joint venture with Renault (Dacia&#x27;s parent company). Originally known as the Renault Tondar 90, the company received over 100,000 orders for the car within a week of it going on sale in March 2007.

Production was launched in Venezuela in 2006 and in Syria in 2007.

<text>William McPherson Allen (September 1, 1900 – October 28, 1985) was an American businessman in the aviation industry who served as the President of Boeing from 1945 to 1968.

==Life and career==
Born in Lolo, Montana, he attended the University of Montana, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He graduated in 1925 from Harvard Law School, and joined the Board of Boeing Air Transport in 1930 while remaining an employee of his Seattle law firm, Donworth, Todd &amp; Higgins. A year later he joined the Board of Boeing Airplane Company as corporate counsel.

Following the death of Boeing president Philip G. Johnson in 1944, Chairman Claire Egtvedt was tasked with appointing his replacement. Feeling that none of the company&#x27;s senior engineers had a sufficiently broad background to run the company, he turned to Bill Allen. Considering himself unqualified to run an engineering company, Allen at first declined the offer before finally accepting. Allen served as the president of the Boeing Company from September 1, 1945, until April 29, 1968. He also served as the chairman of the Boeing Company from 1968 through 1972. While he was president of Boeing, he made the famous decision in 1952 to &quot;bet the company&quot;, when he authorized construction of the Boeing 367-80 and again when he authorized the launch of development of the Boeing 707. He also participated in launching other planes of renown, among them the Boeing 727, Boeing 737, and Boeing 747.

In 1966, Allen asked Malcolm T. Stamper to spearhead production of the new 747 airplane on which the company&#x27;s future was riding. This was a monumental engineering and management challenge, and included construction of the world&#x27;s biggest factory in which to build the 747 at Everett, Washington, a plant which is the size of 40 football fields.

== Recognition and awards ==

In 1965, Allen received the Vermilye Medal from The Franklin Institute.

In 1971, Allen received the &quot;Tony Jannus Award&quot; ` for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation.

In 1971, Allen was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. For his lifelong contributions to aviation. 

In 1975, Allen was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

In 1975, Allen was one of the first four living members inducted into the &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine National Business Hall of Fame. In 2003 an article in &quot;Fortune&quot; by Jim Collins ranked Allen #2 among &quot;The 10 Greatest CEOs of All Time.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In the last years of his life, Allen suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died in Seattle on October 28, 1985, at the age of 85.

Allen is profiled in Senator John McCain&#x27;s and Mark Salter&#x27;s 2007 book, &quot;Hard Call: Great Decisions and the Extraordinary People Who Made Them&quot;.

<doc id="1273734" wikidata="Q1369121" url="?curid=1273734" title="Voice coil">
<text>A voice coil (consisting of a former, collar, and winding) is the coil of wire attached to the apex of a loudspeaker cone. It provides the motive force to the cone by the reaction of a magnetic field to the current passing through it. 

The term is also used for voice coil linear motors such as those used to move the heads inside hard disk drives, which produce a larger force and move a longer distance but work on the same principle. In some applications, such as the operation of servo valves, electronic focus adjustment on digital cameras, these are known as voice coil motors (VCM).

==Operation==
By driving a current through the voice coil, a magnetic field is produced. This magnetic field causes the voice coil to react to the magnetic field from a permanent magnet fixed to the speaker&#x27;s frame, thereby moving the cone of the speaker. By applying an audio waveform to the voice coil, the cone will reproduce the sound pressure waves, corresponding to the original input signal.

==Design considerations==
Because the moving parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to accurately reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much current through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called &quot;ribbon-wire&quot;, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing distortion and possibly mechanical damage.

Power handling is related to the heat resistance of the wire insulation, adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil&#x27;s position within the magnetic gap. The majority of loudspeakers use &#x27;overhung&#x27; voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the magnetic gap. In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The power handling is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the voice coil. Some magnet designs include aluminium heat-sink rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving power handling. If all other conditions remain constant, the area of the voice coil windings is proportional to the power handling of the coil. Thus a 100 mm diameter voice coil, with a 12 mm winding height has similar power handling to a 50 mm diameter voice coil with a 24 mm winding height.

In &#x27;underhung&#x27; voice coil designs (see below), the coil is shorter than the magnetic gap, a topology that provides consistent electromotive force over a limited range of motion, known as Xmax. If the coil is overdriven it may leave the gap, generating significant distortion and losing the heat-sinking benefit of the steel, heating rapidly. 

Many hi-fi, and almost all professional low frequency loudspeakers (woofers) include vents in the magnet system to provide forced-air cooling of the voice coil. The pumping action of the cone and the dustcap draws in cool air and expels hot air. This method of cooling relies upon cone motion, so is ineffective at midrange or treble frequencies, although venting of midranges and tweeters does provide some acoustic advantages.

In the earliest loudspeakers, voice coils were wound onto paper bobbins, which was appropriate for modest power levels. As more powerful amplifiers became available, alloy 1145 aluminium foil was widely substituted for paper bobbins, and the voice coils survived increased power. Typical modern hi-fi loudspeaker voice coils employ materials which can withstand operating temperatures up to 150°C, or even 180°C. For professional loudspeakers, advanced thermoset composite materials are available to improve voice coil survival under severe simultaneous thermal (&lt;300°C) and mechanical stresses. 

Aluminium was widely used in the speaker industry due to its low cost, ease of bonding, and structural strength. When higher power amplifiers emerged, especially in professional sound, the limitations of aluminium were exposed. It rather efficiently but inconveniently transfers heat from the voice coil into the adhesive bonds of the loudspeaker, thermally degrading or even burning them. Motion of the aluminium bobbin in the magnetic gap creates eddy currents within the material, which further increase the temperature, hindering long-term survival. In 1955 DuPont developed Kapton, a polyimide plastic film which did not suffer from aluminium&#x27;s deficiencies, so Kapton, and later Kaneka Apical were widely adopted for voice coils. As successful as these dark brown plastic films were for most hi-fi voice coils, they also had some less attractive properties, principally their cost, and an unfortunate tendency to soften when hot. Hisco P450, developed in 1992 to address the softening issue in professional speakers, is a thermoset composite of thin glassfibre cloth, impregnated with polyimide resin, combining the best characteristics of polyimide with the temperature resistance and stiffness of glassfibre. It withstands brutal physical stresses and operating temperatures up to 300°C, while its stiffness helps maintain the speaker&#x27;s &#x27;cold&#x27; frequency response. 

The actual wire employed in voice coil winding is almost always copper, with an electrical insulation coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost. Where maximum sensitivity or extended high frequency response is required from a loudspeaker, aluminium wire may be substituted, to reduce the moving mass of the coil. While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about one third of the mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper. 

Anodized aluminium flat wire may be used, providing an insulating oxide layer more resistant to dielectric breakdown than enamel coatings on other voice coil wire. This creates lightweight, low-inductance voice coils, ideally suited to use in small, extended range speakers. The principal power limitation on such coils is the thermal softening point of the adhesives which bond the wire to the bobbin, or the bobbin to the spider and coil.

Voice coils can be used for applications other than loudspeakers, where time force linearity and long strokes are needed. Some environments like vacuum or space require specific attention during conception, in order to evacuate coil losses. Several specific methods can be used to facilitate thermal drain.

==Overhung and underhung coils==
The image above shows two ways in which the voice coil is immersed in the magnetic field. The most common method is the &quot;overhung&quot; design where the height of the voice coil is greater than the magnetic gap&#x27;s height. The &quot;underhung&quot; design which is used mostly in high-end speakers has the coil&#x27;s height smaller than the gap&#x27;s. The differences, advantages and disadvantages of both methods are listed below.

Overhung coil
* Coil height is greater than the gap&#x27;s height.
* This method keeps the number of windings within the magnetic field (or flux) constant over the coil&#x27;s normal excursion range.
* Higher coil mass, sensitivity low to medium.
* Soft non-linearity as the coil exceeds limits.

Underhung coil
* Gap&#x27;s height is greater than the coil&#x27;s height.
* This method keeps the magnetic flux that the coil experiences, constant over the coil&#x27;s normal excursion range.
* Low coil mass, sensitivity medium to high.
* Hard non-linearity as the coil exceeds limits.

Both topologies attempt the same goal: linear force acting on the coil, for a driver that reproduces the applied signal faithfully.

==Other uses for the term==
The term &quot;voice coil&quot; has been generalized and refers to any galvanometer-like mechanism that uses a solenoid to move an object back-and-forth within a magnetic field.

In particular, it is commonly used to refer to the coil of wire that moves the read–write heads in a moving-head disk drive. In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.

<text>Illusionistic tradition is a style of theatre that was created in Italy during the Renaissance. Its focus was primarily centered on grandiose spectacle in theatrical performance. Stages made use of Italianate scenery, including Proscenium arch, perspective, border flats, and a raked stage to create a visual image that had never before been used.

<doc id="1273743" wikidata="Q191514" url="?curid=1273743" title="Cerbera odollam">
<text>Cerbera odollam is a tree species in the family Apocynaceae commonly known as the suicide tree or pong-pong. It bears a fruit known as othalanga whose seeds yield a potent poison called cerberin that has been used for trials by ordeal, suicide, and poisonings.

It is native to South and Southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and Queensland, Australia, growing preferentially along sandy coasts, riverbanks, and by mangrove swamps. It is also grown in tropical areas such as Hawaii as an ornamental.

== Description ==

&quot;Cerbera odollam&quot; bears a close resemblance to oleander, another highly toxic plant from the same family. It grows to approximately 10–12 meters in height. Its leaves are glossy and it has white flowers with yellow throats. The plant as a whole yields a milky, white latex.

Its fruit, about 5–10cm in length, starts green and becomes red as it matures. It has a green fibrous shell enclosing an ovoid kernel measuring approximately 2 cm × 1.5 cm and containing two extremely poisonous seeds. On exposure to air, the white kernel turns violet, then dark grey, and ultimately brown, or black.

== History ==
=== Common names ===
&quot;Cerbera odollam&quot; is known by a number of vernacular names, depending on the region. These include &quot;othalam&quot; (ഒതളം) in the Malayalam language used in Kerala, India; &quot;kattu arali&quot; (காட்டரளி) in the adjacent state of Tamil Nadu; &quot;dabur&quot; (ডাবুর) in Bengali; &quot;famentana&quot;, &quot;kisopo&quot;, &quot;samanta&quot; or &quot;tangena&quot; in Madagascar; and &quot;pong-pong&quot;, &quot;buta-buta&quot;, &quot;bintaro&quot; or &quot;nyan&quot; in Southeast Asia.

===Use in trials by ordeal===
The poisonous kernel of the &quot;Cerbera odollam&quot; fruit was used in trials by ordeal like the tangena throughout the regions where it grew. In Madagascar in the 18th and 19th centuries, over 3000 people died per year from consuming &quot;Cerbera odollam&quot; seeds in a trial by ordeal. These trials were intended to determine whether the subject was guilty of a crime, often witchcraft. In these trials, a dosage of the seed was administered. If the subject lived, they were considered innocent of whatever crime they were accused. If they died, they were considered guilty. These trials relied on the belief that some underlying spirit would distinguish between innocence and guilt.

Trials by ordeal using cerberin were extremely common. In the mid-1800s, leaders attempted to regulate trials by ordeal in Madagascar. For minor crimes, dogs or chickens were used as a substitute for humans. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the early 1900s that this practice stopped.

===Use for suicide===
&quot;Cerbera odollam&quot; was also frequently used for suicide and continues to be used for this purpose in the modern day. For instance, a 2004 study found that it was responsible for about one suicide death per week between 1989 and 1999 in Kerala, India. To commit suicide, people would remove the kernels from the seed and combine it with jaggery to eat. Death would occur quickly, about 3-6 hours after ingestion.

== Toxicity ==
Cerberin, the poisonous compound in the kernels of &quot;Cerbera odollam&quot;, is a cardiac glycoside and, as such, blocks the heart&#x27;s sodium and potassium ATPase. One kernel contains a fatal dose of the toxin. 

===Symptoms===

Electrocardiographic abnormalities are common, the most common being sinus bradycardia. Around half of the patients develop thrombocytopenia. Temporary cardiac pacing has been used in the management, apart from other supportive measures.

Other common symptoms of cerberin poisoning include a burning sensation in the mouth, vomiting, retching, nausea, irregular respiration, headache, coma, and death. Some cases are asymptomatic.

===Use as a poison===
&quot;Cerbera odollam&quot; is commonly used for poisonings as well as suicides. Its bitter flavor can easily be masked by spicy food, allowing victims to ingest it without noticing. In Kerala, &quot;C. odollam&quot; is responsible for about 50% of plant poisoning cases and 10% of all poisonings.

The fatalities from poisonings, particularly from &quot;C. odollam&quot;, are underestimated due to the lack of testing in most cases. Poisonings outside the tree&#x27;s natural range are considered rare.

== Modern uses ==
The seeds of &quot;C. odollam&quot; are used as biopesticides, insect repellants, and rat poisons due to its toxicity to these animals. 

Investigations have also been made into the feasibility of using the seeds as a feedstock in the production of biodiesel. Oil can be extracted from the seeds and transesterified into fatty acid methyl esters. This is a good alternative to other plants commonly used for biodiesels because unlike these plants, it grows on typically non-arable land and therefore does not compete with food crops.

<doc id="1273744" wikidata="Q682150" url="?curid=1273744" title="Alphonse Alley">
<text>Alphonse Amadou Alley (April 9, 1930 – March 28, 1987) was a Beninese army officer and political figure. He was most active when his country was known as Dahomey. He was born in Bassila, central Dahomey, and enrolled in schools in Togo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and Senegal before enlisting in the French army in 1950. He saw combat in Indochina from 1950 to 1953, in Morocco from 1955 to 1956, and in Algeria from 1959 to 1961. After the coup in 1965, President Christophe Soglo promoted Alley Chief of Staff of the Army. Young army officer Maurice Kouandété was appointed Alley&#x27;s &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; in 1967.

Kouandété launched another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he was forced to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw the creation of a new constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey&#x27;s first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.

Alley&#x27;s retirement was marked by a series of discharges from the military, trials, and prison sentences. At one trial, Zinsou&#x27;s conduct sparked another coup led by Kouandété. On October 26, 1972, Mathieu Kérékou seized power in a coup. He ended Alley&#x27;s military career, as well as that of every other senior officer, and named Alley commissioner of the National Oil Wells (SNADAH), a role with very little responsibility. Kérékou accused Alley of plotting against him on February 28, 1973, and sentenced the latter to 20 years in prison. He died on March 28, 1987.

==Military background==
Alley was born on April 9, 1930, in Bassila, central Dahomey. He was a member of the small Widji ethnic group, based in the north. His father was also a military commander, who served the French in Syria during 1942 and helped train police in Togo. Alphonse enrolled in schools in Togo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and Senegal until he enlisted in the French army in 1950. His first combat operation later that year was at the Indochinese Peninsula for the First Indochina War. Alley withdrew in late 1953, shortly before Operation Castor was launched at Dien Bien Phu. After this wartime experience, he went the Saint Maxient Non-Commissioned Officer School in France (now the National Active Non-Commissioned Officers School (France) or École Nationale des Sous-Officiers d’Actives (ENSOA)). He saw combat in Morocco from 1955 to 1956 and in Algeria from 1959 to 1961, where he became a paratrooper.

After Dahomey gained independence in 1960, Alley travelled back to his homeland and led a paratrooper unit. At first, he was a lieutenant, but he was promoted to captain in 1962 and major in 1964. Later that year he led several soldiers to the Dahomey-Niger border during a border dispute. Historian Samuel Decalo described Alley as &quot;a jovial, dashing, easygoing and well-liked figure&quot; and was known by diplomats as &quot;the wine, women and song officer&quot;.

In Dahomeyan coups in 1963 and 1965, Alley urged General Christophe Soglo to seize power. After the 1965 coup, Soglo promoted Alley Chief of Staff of the Army. Alley made known his disagreements with Soglo on several occasions, though he remained loyal nonetheless. Young army officer Maurice Kouandété was appointed Alley&#x27;s &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; in 1967 and his frequent opposition to Alley during staff meetings helped to create factions in the Dahomeyan Army.

==1967 coup d&#x27;état==
Kouandété had aspirations of his own. On December 17, 1967, he and 60 other soldiers led a military coup and toppled Soglo. Kouandété seized the presidency, though he was unsure what to do with it. Members of his faction urged the new president to remain at his post, though the general public&#x27;s opinion was against him. Meanwhile, France refused to aid Dahomey and would not recognise Kouandété. He was forced to appointed Alley provisional president two days later, although Kouandété had placed Alley under house arrest and accused him of &quot;shirking [his] duties&quot; and maintained a &quot;policy of appeasement.&quot; Kouandété served as prime minister thereafter.

==President of Dahomey==
Alley was one of the few figures who were trusted by northern and southern Dahomeyans alike. His role was only temporary, until power was to be ceded back to civilians in six months time. Among the events on the official timetable, which the military published on January 17, 1968, was the creation of a nonmilitary Constitution Commission on January 31, which would write a new Dahomeyan constitution. The document granted Alley strong executive power, and was adopted by the Comite Militaire Revolutionaire, Alley&#x27;s interim government comprisising only military officers, in early March. A national referendum on the constitution was held on March 31, which passed with 92 percent in favor.

The Comite decided to ban all former presidents, vice presidents, government ministers, and National Assembly presidents from the upcoming presidential election. This was to prevent Dahomeyan politics from repeating its practices of old. The Supreme Court ruled the proscription was 
unconstitutional, although Alley overruled the decision. He instead only recognised five candidates as legitimate.

In response to their disqualification, former presidents Hubert Maga and Sourou-Migan Apithy staged protests while Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, another ex-president, supported an obscure candidate named Basile Adjou Moumouni. The election was held on May 15, and was Dahomey&#x27;s first since 1964. Moumouni won the election with 80 percent of the vote, but Alley declared the result void because the protest prevented nearly three-quarters of the electorate from voting. This result sparked further demonstrations, and Maga, Apithy, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and former president Christophe Soglo were forbidden to enter the country, in an attempt to crack down on dissent. Alley felt he had made a mistake in disqualifying Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, as he believed that only they could bring unity to Dahomey.

In a radio address on May 11, Alley announced that due to the nullification, the military would heve to stay in power beyond June 17. He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété&#x27;s mouthpiece.

Alley attempted to remove Kouandété from the army, though to no avail. In any case, by June his fellow officers had made up their mind as to the next president. After talks with unionists, civil servants, and academics, they &quot;entrust[ed] the reins of power to Émile Derlin Zinsou for at least five years&quot;, who was &quot;charged to form a government of national union&quot;, as per a June 28 newspaper article by the state press. On July 17, Alley handed power to Zinsou, a veteran politician.

==Later life==

After Alley was retired from the presidency, he was purged from combat in the army and was assigned the new post of military attaché in Washington, D.C, an appointment he refused to accept. General Etienne Eyadema, the president of neighboring Togo, thought that this &quot;serve[d Alley] right, for being stupid enough to give power back to the politicians. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going to be that dumb.&quot; Alley was discharged from the armed forces altogether in September, with Kouandété taking his place as Chief of Staff.

On July 11, 1969, Kouandété accused Alley of plotting to kidnap and murder him. Facing the death penalty, Alley was sentenced to ten years of hard labor at an open trial held on October 4. Zinsou had intervened for Alley, and it strained relations between the president and Kouandété. The latter decided to lead another coup on December 10. In the aftermath, Alley was released from incarceration and reinstated in the army. In July 1968, he was named Secretary General of National Defence. Kouandété ended up becoming Alley&#x27;s adjutant.

In 1971, Alley allowed Togolese refugee Noe Kutuklui protection in Dahomey, despite official government policy to the contrary. On October 26, 1972, Mathieu Kérékou seized power in a coup. He ended Alley&#x27;s military career, as well as that of every other senior officer, and named him commissioner of the National Oil Wells (SNADAH), a role with very little responsibility. Kérékou accused Alley of plotting against him on February 28, 1973, and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. He was released on amnesty on August 1, 1984, as well as all other political detainees besides those involved in the &quot;ignoble and barbarous imperialist armed aggression of Sunday, January 16, 1967,&quot; as the official press release states.

Alley died on March 28, 1987. He was survived by his son, Zacharie. Plans for a mausoleum are in the works, decades after his death.

<text>The Golden Nugget Las Vegas is a luxury hotel and casino located in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada on the Fremont Street Experience. The property is owned and operated by Landry&#x27;s, Inc. It has 2,419 hotel rooms.

==History==
The Golden Nugget was originally built in 1946, making it one of the oldest casinos in Las Vegas. Jackie Gaughan at one time owned a stake in the hotel as part of his many downtown properties. Steve Wynn bought a stake in the Nugget, which he increased so that, in 1973, he became the majority shareholder, and the youngest casino owner in Las Vegas and purchased the neighboring California Club in 1973 and combined the two properties under the former’s banner. In 1977, he opened the first hotel tower and the resort earned its first four-diamond rating from Mobil Travel Guide. It was the foundation for Wynn&#x27;s rise to prominence in the casino industry. Frank Sinatra periodically headlined at the Golden Nugget. 

The second hotel tower opened in 1984 along with the showroom, and the third tower was opened in 1989.

In 2000, the Golden Nugget (and all of Mirage Resorts&#x27; other properties) was sold to MGM Grand, Inc. (later named MGM Mirage).

Although the Golden Nugget was profitable, it was not part of the master expansion plan of the corporation which was focused on consolidating a long stretch of the Strip by acquiring Mandalay Resort Group, building City Center, and beginning construction in Macau. Gaming revenue on Fremont Street had peaked in fiscal year 1993. The Golden Nugget was sold in 2003, for $215 million to Poster Financial Group, owned by Timothy Poster and Thomas Breitling. When Poster Financial assumed control of the Golden Nugget, they began to upgrade the gambling operation by installing new cashless slot machines and by increasing the maximum bet available at table games to $15,000. Their story became the basis for &quot;The Casino&quot;, a television series on Fox that premiered on June 14, 2004.

On February 4, 2005, Houston, Texas–based Landry&#x27;s, Inc announced its intent to purchase the property and the Golden Nugget Laughlin. The sale closed on September 27, 2005. After the purchase, the Golden Nugget embarked on a 14-month, $100 million renovation project, which was completed in November 2006. In December 2007, the Golden Nugget completed its $70 million Phase II project, which expanded the resort west onto First Street and introduced additional entertainment, event and dining venues. Phase III was the opening of the 500-room, $150 million Rush hotel Tower on November 20, 2009, along with the Chart House restaurant.

*In all &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; games (except &quot;HD Remix&quot;), Balrog&#x27;s (M. Bison in Japanese) stage is set in front of the Golden Nugget, with the sign clearly seen in the back. In &quot;HD Remix&quot;, it has been changed to the &quot;Crazy Buffalo&quot;, presumably in reference to the name of Balrog&#x27;s original Super Combo. The updated version of the scenario that appears in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; changes the name of the casino to the &quot;Golden Bullion&quot;, most likely to avoid legal issues.
*The name &quot;Golden Nugget&quot; also designates several casino games: &quot;Golden Nugget&quot; (1997), &quot;Golden Nugget 64&quot; (1998), &quot;Golden Nugget Casino&quot; (2004; Game Boy Advance), and &quot;Golden Nugget Casino DS&quot; (2006).

* The Golden Nugget appears as a Safehouse for players in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. The safehouse appears as a hotel room.

==Attractions==
The world&#x27;s largest gold nugget on display, the Hand of Faith, is still shown today in the Golden Nugget lobby. Weighing and in length, the Hand of Faith was found near Kingower, Victoria, Australia, and put on display at the casino in 1981 amid a number of other gold nuggets.

The casino&#x27;s large hotel sign at its entrance off Fremont and Casino Center was removed in 1984 when the casino underwent renovations. The old sign presently sits at the YESCO signage yard.

The expanded resort is built around two aquariums. The larger faces the swimming pool and incorporates a slide through the tank containing full-grown sharks. The smaller aquarium is in the lobby of the Rush Tower. 

A total of five specialty restaurants were added: Vic &amp; Anthony&#x27;s Steakhouse, Grotto Ristorante, Lillie&#x27;s Asian Cuisine, Red Sushi and Chart House. The Chart House has a view of one of the aquariums. The pool is a $30 million unique three-level adventure with an enclosed slide through a shark tank, hidden grottos, swim-up bars, jacuzzis and multi-depth areas.

==Golden Nugget and Poster Financial group==
Tom Breitling and Tim Poster were the highest profile successful entrepreneurs who profited in the downtown market during the last crisis. As recounted in Tom Breitling&#x27;s book, &quot;Double or Nothing&quot;, the partners agreed to buy the Golden Nugget and had an agreement to sell the property after operating it for only one year. The partners made $113 million in profit, called the highest rate of return in such a short time in the gaming industry. However, the partners had a negative income for the year and the fortune was made while total revenue for downtown was still basically flat.

<doc id="1273747" wikidata="Q665192" url="?curid=1273747" title="Six-String Samurai">
<text>Six-String Samurai is a 1998 American post-apocalyptic action comedy film directed by Lance Mungia and starring Jeffrey Falcon and Justin McGuire. Brian Tyler composed the score for this film along with Red Elvises, the latter providing the majority of the soundtrack.

The film was greeted with a great deal of excitement when shown at Slamdance in 1998, winning the Slamdance awards for best editing and cinematography, and gathering extremely favorable reviews from influential alternative, cult and indie film publications such as &quot;Fangoria&quot;, &quot;Film Threat&quot; and Ain&#x27;t It Cool News. It is billed as a &quot;post-apocalyptic musical satire&quot;.

In a limited theatrical release the film ran for several months in a few theaters, gaining a reputation as a minor cult film; having a budget of $2,000,000, it only made a mere $124,494 at the box offices. An intended trilogy has been discussed but not yet realized, just like the predicted launching of the career of the film&#x27;s star, Jeffrey Falcon, a martial artist who had appeared in several Hong Kong action movies in the 1980s and early 1990s. While Mungia made several music videos, he did not direct another feature until the 2005 film &quot;The Crow: Wicked Prayer&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1957, the Soviet Union attacks the United States with nuclear weapons, rendering most of the nation uninhabitable. The American government has collapsed with the exception of the haven known as Lost Vegas, ruled by King Elvis. The Red Army has been besieging Lost Vegas, but the lack of supplies over the years has relegated them to a gang of thugs. Forty years later King Elvis dies and radio disc jockey Keith Mortimer announces a call for all musicians to come to Lost Vegas to try to become the new King of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll. The ending of His message, &quot;Vegas needs a new King!&quot;

Buddy, a lone guitarist and swordsman, saves an unnamed boy he simply calls &quot;Kid&quot; from a group of bandits; consequently, as the Kid&#x27;s mother was killed by the bandits he tags along with Buddy much to the latter&#x27;s annoyance. As the duo travel through the desert wasteland, the heavy metal-playing Death stages several attempts to prevent Buddy from reaching Lost Vegas alive and claim the throne for himself. After enduring an attack by a bounty-hunting bowling team, Buddy and the Kid steal a car from another musician to continue their journey. They are later attacked on the road by bandits but escape.

When their car breaks down, Buddy and the Kid attempt to borrow a wrench from a suburban family, unaware that they are cannibals. Buddy leaves the Kid with them and takes off on foot. The Kid is about to be eaten but is spared after a group of Windmill People invade the home and the family flees with Buddy and the Kid&#x27;s abandoned car after revealing they had a socket wrench needed to fix it. Buddy returns to defeat the Windmill People; he is reunited with the Kid and they continue their journey on an abandoned motorcycle. Meanwhile, Death has been killing off all other musicians coming across his path and taking their guitar picks as trophies.

Buddy and the Kid arrive in the town of Fallout, where he leaves the Kid with some locals and enters a bar to drink and spend time with a cheerleader. Death arrives but the Kid warns Buddy in time for them to flee. Before they do Buddy is approached by a young guitarist, whom he then humiliates. Continuing their travel, Buddy is attacked by the guitarist. Buddy unintentionally kills him in self defense, and, feeling guilty, he lays his sword down and walks away, but the Kid brings it back to him, still believing in Buddy and helping regain his confidence. Eventually the two begin to bond closer. Later, after they collapse in the desert, they are ambushed by Death and his bandmates, a trio of archers. Buddy slides the Kid and his guitar to safety while he battles the archers, but when the Kid is captured by a group of underground mutants, Buddy pursues the mutants to their lair. Death decides not to follow him as there are other musicians left to kill saving Buddy for last.

Buddy manages to save the Kid, and after returning to the surface, they find their road to Vegas blocked by the Red Army. After a grueling battle, Buddy is injured with the Kid dragging him to continue. Death finally catches up to them and engages Buddy in a guitar duel clashing their styles of music against one another; Buddy, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll and Death, Heavy Metal. When Buddy proves the better guitarist, an angry Death orders his bandmates to shoot him and the Kid with their bows. Buddy shields the Kid, getting shot in the back, but rises up and battles Death in a sword fight. Death mortally wounds Buddy in the end but the Kid discovers water is Death&#x27;s weakness after spitting at him. The Kid then melts Death away with his water canteen.

With his defeat, Death&#x27;s bandmates are in shock that the Kid bested him. They give him a card and tell him with admiration that if he ever needs them to call them, and they take their leave. The Kid, saddened by Buddy disappearing after dying, bravely accepts to finish Buddy&#x27;s journey. He puts on his clothes and glasses, and carries his sword and guitar. With Lost Vegas now in sight, the Kid has completed Buddy&#x27;s dream, and the film ends with him turning into Buddy, symbolizing he&#x27;s inherited His spirit as a crowd cheers him from Lost Vegas.

==Production==
===Opening sequence distortion===
The opening sequence has an intentionally distorted visual effect. The de-anamorphic visuals are a subtle &quot;tribute&quot; to the Chinese martial arts films (notably the films by Shaw Brothers) that often had their wide-screen opening sequences compressed to the 1.33:1 format of TV screens for VHS release.

===Thematic elements===

Throughout the film there are homages to many major musical movements in the United States. Buddy, the main character, is a symbol of the birth of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. He shares the same clothing style of Buddy Holly, especially his horn-rimmed glasses.

Death, a character resembling Slash from Guns N&#x27; Roses, kills a character representing Jerry Lee Lewis during the film. Death also dispatches a mariachi band and another musician dressed country western style. His minions also torment a traveler dressed in hip hop fashion. Buddy also has a duel with a musician (wielding a ukulele) resembling Ritchie Valens, who died in the same 1959 plane crash as the original Buddy Holly. Death also kills rock music, through the death of Buddy. However, the last scene shows the child donning Buddy&#x27;s clothing, suggesting that though rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is dead, there is still hope for the future.

The film also has references to &quot;the Wizard of Oz&quot;, loosely imitating the 1939 movie. A little person instructs Buddy to &quot;follow the yellow brick road&quot;. Lost Vegas, seen from the distance, looks like the Emerald City. Death is obsessed with a specific object, Buddy&#x27;s guitar pick, much like the Wicked Witch trying to get Dorothy&#x27;s red slippers. Finally, Death is killed when sprayed with water, as was the Wicked Witch. When Buddy dies, his body disappears, leaving only his clothes for the kid to take, again like the Wicked Witch.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Six-String Samurai: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; is the original soundtrack to the film, released by Rykodisc on August 25, 1998. It features the score by Brian Tyler and Red Elvises, along with select dialogue tracks from the film. The Enhanced CD release includes the film&#x27;s trailer.

===Track listing===

==Critical reception==
&quot;Six-String Samurai&quot; received mixed reviews, with a 57% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 reviews.

Film Threat gave the film a perfect score of five stars. Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;A rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll &quot;Mad Max&quot; served up Cantonese style, this is one wildly original and highly entertaining American indie with genuine commercial appeal.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; commented on his review that &quot;If the film didn&#x27;t have an underlying intelligence, it would soon be irritating -- it&#x27;s too cartoonish and one-dimensional. But Falcon, an ace martial-arts practitioner, is dazzling as the nerdy main attraction, equally adept at sword fighting and guitar picking.&quot; Laurie Stone of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote on her review: &quot;There&#x27;s one charming sequence, with vaudeville grace and tragicomedy worthy of Beckett, but the rest of the film, even with startling visual effects and some impish humor, is repetitious and derivative, playing like an endless commercial for bullet-hole chic.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Six-String Samurai&quot; was released on a non-anamorphic DVD by Palm Pictures in March 1999. Extras included the theatrical trailer and two music videos by the Red Elvises.

In March 2021, it was announced that the film would be receiving its first ever HD release in a Blu-ray/Ultra HD Blu-ray combo-pack from Vinegar Syndrome. Newly created extras include commentaries with Mungia and cinematographer Kristian Bernier, as well as a brand new extended length making-of documentary directed by Mungia and Elijah Drenner.

==Other media==
In September, 1998, a single &quot;Six String Samurai&quot; comic was released from Rob Liefeld&#x27;s Awesome Entertainment. Written by Liefeld and Matt Hawkins, it featured art by &#x27;Awesome&#x27; artists Dan Fraga and John Stinsman. A continuation rather than an adaptation, the plot summary from the comic is as follows:

In this alternate universe, in 1957 the Russians took the United States by nuclear force. Only one piece of the American frontier remained free, a patch of land known as Lost Vegas. Through this desert wasteland wanders the &quot;six string samurai,&quot; a latter-day Buddy Holly who handles a guitar or a sword with equal skill. He&#x27;s a man on a collision course with destiny: It seems that King Elvis, who ruled over the land of Vegas for forty years, has finally taken his last curtain call and the throne now stands empty. But it&#x27;s a rough road to the big city and the body count is likely to be high, as demonstrated in this postapocalyptic future with a beat we can dance to.

==Cultural references==
* In the RPG &quot;&quot;, an achievement called &quot;New Vegas Samurai&quot; is available with an image based on Six String Samurai&#x27;s movie poster. It is acquired when the player deals more than 10,000 points of damage with melee weapons.
*The intro to the song “Holy Diver Pt.2” by Pannuci&#x27;s Pizza is a quote from Head Pin Pal saying “Nice Tuxedo. Nice Tuxedo to die in!”

<text>Morris Halle, Pinkowitz (; July 23, 1923 – April 2, 2018), was a Latvian-born American linguist who was an Institute Professor, and later professor emeritus, of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The father of &quot;modern phonology&quot;, he was best known for his pioneering work in generative phonology, having written &quot;On Accent and Juncture in English&quot; in 1956 with Noam Chomsky and Fred Lukoff and &quot;The Sound Pattern of English&quot; in 1968 with Chomsky. He also co-authored (with Samuel Jay Keyser) the earliest theory of generative metrics, and developed the Distributed Morphology framework with Alec Marantz.

==Life and career==
Halle was born - as Morris Pinkowitz () - on July 23, 1923, in Liepāja, Latvia. In 1929 he moved with his Jewish family to Riga. He arrived in the United States in 1940 and graduated from George Washington High School. From 1941 to 1943, he studied engineering at the City College of New York. He entered the United States Army in 1943 and was discharged in 1946, at which point he went to the University of Chicago, where he got his master&#x27;s degree in linguistics in 1948. He then studied at Columbia University under Roman Jakobson, became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1951, and earned his PhD from Harvard University in 1955. He is considered to be, with Noam Chomsky, the founder of the modern linguistics department at MIT. He retired from MIT in 1996, but he remained active in research and publication. He was fluent in German, Yiddish, Latvian, Russian, Hebrew and English.

Halle was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1960. He was President of the Linguistic Society of America in 1974. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Halle was married for fifty-six years to painter, artist and activist Rosamond Thaxter Halle (née Strong), until her death in April 2011. They had three sons: David, John and Timothy.

Halle resided in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He died on April 2, 2018, at the age of 94.

<text>The Golden Nugget Laughlin (formerly the Nevada Club) is a hotel and casino located on the banks of the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Landry&#x27;s, Inc. It offers a number of restaurants, 300 guest rooms and suites, a casino floor, and meeting spaces. The Golden Nugget offers water taxi service from Bullhead City, Arizona, on the opposite side of the river.

Restaurants at the Golden Nugget include Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Claim Jumper, Saltgrass Steak House and Bean and Bread.

==History==

The property was previously known as the Nevada Club. In 1986, the resort underwent a major renovation. In 1988, the Del Webb Corporation sold the Nevada Club to Golden Nugget Inc. for $40 million, and it was renamed as the Golden Nugget Laughlin. The 300-room hotel was added to the property in 1992, along with a parking garage, new restaurants, and tropical theming, including an indoor rainforest.

In 2004, it was acquired by Poster Financial Group. On May 31, 2005, it was acquired by Landry’s, which was purchasing the Golden Nugget Las Vegas at the same time. Rooms underwent renovation in 2006.

In the years since Landry’s acquired Golden Nugget Las Vegas and Laughlin, three additional Golden Nugget resorts have been developed in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Biloxi, Mississippi and Lake Charles, Louisiana.

<text>The IKCO Samand is a large family sedan produced by IKCO. Production began in 2001, with the first unit being sold the same year. Considered as the national vehicle of Iran, it replaces the Paykan, which was sold from 1967 to 2005.

== Engine and components ==
The Iranian-designed Samand uses the Peugeot 405 platform, equipped with either IKCO-designed EF7 engines or PSA XU7JP/L3 engines, amongst others. IKCO manufactures 80% of Samand&#x27;s parts domestically, including its Iranian-designed engine.

For export markets (and also the Iranian market), IKCO uses the Peugeot TU5JP4 engine. This is because the TU5 is a low-consumption and powerful engine, and because of the ease of finding its parts all over Europe, since the TU5 has been used for the Peugeot 206, Peugeot 307 and Peugeot 207.
The TU5 version of Samand comes with three new options: driver airbag, pre-tensioner seatbelts, headlight height adjuster and active antenna. The car uses Peugeot 405 components. 

Since early 2009, IKCO has used newly developed Iranian engines such as a dual-fuel national engine for its new models (EF7).
In mid-2010, IKCO started to install petrol-only EF7 engines on Samand. The engine is not a petrol-based version of EF7 but the compressed natural gas (CNG) parts of the engine are removed and also the engine control unit (ECU) programme. However, the petrol-based version of the engine is currently under development.

==Performance==
* Fuel Consumption ( City / Combined / Highway (90 km/h) Constant )
* CNG Fuel Consumption numbers are measured in Kg

== Diesel model ==

In 2009, IKCO announced that they will produce Samand with their new engine EFD in 2010; however, due to the required tests for the engine, preparing the car for engine installation, as well as lack of distribution for the Euro IV diesel fuel in the country postponed production to 2011.
On November 30, 2010 IKCO announced the major changes made in Samand compared to dual-fuel or single fuel Samands for making it compatible for installing the EFD engine on.
This main changes are: changing the radiator, installing the intercooler, water and hydraulic hoses, engine housings, exhaust system gearbox and the engine compartment insulations.

== Production ==
The Samand was manufactured in Minsk, Belarus, by the Unison firm, alongside Lublin vans, from 2006 to 2013. Unison signed a new agreement with Iran Khodro in 2018 to produce other car models.

The Samand is assembled by AzSamand in Şamaxı, Azerbaijan under the local name AzSamand Aziz.

Venirauto began assembling Samand sedans (badged Centauro) in Venezuela in 2006.

Siamco produced the Samand, as the (Siamco Sham), in Syria from 2006 to 2012.

From 2008 to 2013, Arab American Vehicles produced the Peugeot Pars, a car similar to the Samand, in Cairo, Egypt.

== Export markets ==

The Samand was exported to the following countries:

Africa
* Algeria
* Egypt
* Ghana
* Mali
* Senegal
Asia
* Afghanistan
* Bangladesh
* Syria
* Tajikistan
* Vietnam
* Iraq
* Lebanon
Europe
* Belarus
* Russia
* Switzerland (although the “U” designates it as a dealer license plate)
* Turkey
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan
* Georgia
South America
* Venezuela

<text>Adolf Schreyer (9 July 1828, Frankfurt-am-Main29 July 1899, Kronberg im Taunus) was a German painter, associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting.

==Biography==
He studied art first at the Städel Institute in his native town, and then at Stuttgart and Munich. He painted many of his favourite subjects in his travels in the East. He first accompanied Maximilian Karl, 6th Prince of Thurn and Taxis through Hungary, Wallachia, Russia and Turkey; then, in 1854, he followed the Austrian army across the Wallachian frontier. In 1856 he went to Egypt and Syria, and in 1861 to Algiers. In 1862 he settled in Paris, but returned to Germany in 1870; and settled at Cronberg near Frankfurt, where he died.

==Work==

Schreyer was, and is still, especially esteemed as a painter of horses, of peasant life in Wallachia and Moldavia, and of battle incidents. His work is remarkable for its excellent equine draughtsmanship, and for the artist&#x27;s power of observation and forceful statement; and has found particular favour among French and American collectors. Of his battle-pictures there are two at the Schwerin Gallery, and others in the collection of Count Mensdorff-Pouilly and in the Raven Gallery, Berlin. His painting of a &quot;Charge of Artillery of Imperial Guard&quot; was formerly at the Luxembourg Museum. The Metropolitan Museum, New York owns three of Schreyer&#x27;s oriental paintings: &quot;Abandoned&quot;, &quot;Arabs on the March&quot; and &quot;Arabs making a detour&quot;; and many of his best pictures are in the Rockefeller family, Vanderbilt family, John Jacob Astor, William Backhouse Astor, Sr., August Belmont, and William Walters collections. At the Kunsthalle Hamburg is his &quot;Wallachian Transport Train&quot;, and at the Staedel Institute, Frankfort, are two of his Wallachian scenes.

<doc id="1273759" wikidata="Q344999" url="?curid=1273759" title="Alosa">
<text>Alosa is a genus of fish, the river herrings, in the family Alosidae. Along with other genera in the subfamily Alosinae, they are generally known as shads. They are distinct from other herrings by having a deeper body and spawning in rivers. Several species can be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Also, several taxa occur in the brackish-water Caspian Sea and the Black Sea basin. Many are found in fresh water during spawning and some are only found in landlocked fresh water.

==Fossil record==
These fishes lived from the Eocene to Quaternary (from 55 million years ago to now). Fossils have been found in Canada, the United States, Greece, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Hungary, Romania, and Italy.
==Appearance==
&quot;Alosa&quot; species are generally dark on the back and top of the head, with blue, violet, or greenish tints. Some can be identified as having a grey or green back. Spots are commonly found behind the head, and the fins may vary from species to species or individually. Most species of &quot;Alosa&quot; weigh or less, with &quot;A. pontica&quot; and &quot;A. fallax&quot; weighing up to 2 kg, and &quot;A. alosa&quot; can exceed 3–4 kg.

==Biology==
Shads are thought to be unique among the fishes in having evolved an ability to detect ultrasound (at frequencies above 20 kHz, which is the limit of human hearing). This was first discovered by fisheries biologists studying a type of shad known as blueback herring, and was later verified in laboratory studies of hearing in American shad. This ability is thought to help them avoid dolphins that find prey using echolocation. &quot;Alosa&quot; species are generally pelagic. They are mostly anadromous or semianadromous with the exception of strictly freshwater landlocked species. &quot;Alosa&quot; species are generally migratory and schooling fish. Males usually mature about a year before females; they spawn in the late spring to summer. Most individuals die shortly after spawning. &quot;Alosa&quot; species seemingly can change readily to adapt to their environments, as species are found in a wide range of temperatures and waters.

==Lifecycle and reproduction==
As &quot;Alosa&quot; species are generally anadromous, they face various obstacles to survival. They may have to pass through numerous barriers and waters to get to either their spawning grounds or normal habitats (the sea in most cases). Estuaries are a major factor in numerous &quot;Alosa&quot; species&#x27; migrations. Estuaries can be highly variable and complex environments contributing to fluctuating biological interactions, with shifts in osmolarity, food sources, predators, etc. Since many adult &quot;Alosa&quot; species die after spawning, only the young generally migrate to the sea from the spawning grounds. Duration of migration varies among fish, but can greatly affect survival.

Reproduction varies by species. Studies done on &quot;Alosa&quot; in Iranian waters have shown that spawning varies in time, place, and temperature of the waters they inhabit. Fecundity may also vary. Species are known to spawn as early as April or as late as August. Temperatures range from about 11 to 27 °C. Fecundity can range from 20,000 to 312,000 eggs. Eggs are pelagic. Geography and temperature are important environmental factors in egg and young-of-year development.

The lifespan of &quot;Alosa&quot; species can be up to 10 years, but this is generally uncommon, as many die after spawning.

== Systematics ==
The systematics and distribution of &quot;Alosa&quot; shads are complex. The genus inhabits a wide range of habitats, and many taxa are migratory. A few forms are landlocked, including one from Killarney in Ireland, two from lakes in northern Italy, and two in Greece. Several species are native to the Black and Caspian Seas. &quot;Alosa&quot; species of the Caspian are systemically characterized by the number of rakers on the first gill arch. They are classified as being &quot;multirakered&quot;, &quot;medium-rakered&quot;, or &quot;oligorakered&quot;. The multirakered are primarily plankton feeders, the oligorakered have large rakers and are predators, and the medium-rakered generally consume a mixed diet. Most current species of the genus &quot;Alosa&quot; in North America can be found in Florida, whereas the distribution of most of them is broader.

Morphology is notoriously liable to adapt to changing food availability in these fish. Several taxa seem to have evolved quite recently, making molecular analyses difficult. In addition, hybridization may be a factor in shad phylogeny. Nonetheless, some trends are emerging. The North American species except the American shad &quot;A. sapidissima&quot; can probably be separated in a subgenus &quot;Pomolobus&quot;. Conversely, the proposed genus (or subgenus) &quot;Caspialosa&quot; for the Caspian Sea forms is rejected due to paraphyly.

==Recreational fishing==
==Commercial fishing==
==Management==
Shad populations have been in decline for years due to spawning areas blocked by dams, habitat destruction, pollution, and overfishing. Management of shad has called for more conservative regulations, and policies to help the species have lower fishing mortality.

==Political significance==
Shad serve a peculiar symbolic role in Virginia state politics. On the year of every gubernatorial election, would-be candidates, lobbyists, campaign workers, and reporters gather in the town of Wakefield, Virginia, for shad planking. American shad served as the focal point of John McPhee&#x27;s book &quot;The Founding Fish&quot;.

==Culinary use==

The roe, or more properly the entire engorged uterus of the American shad—filled with ripening eggs, sautéed in clarified butter and garnished with parsley and a slice of lemon—is considered a great delicacy, and commands high prices when available.

<doc id="1273765" wikidata="Q5063899" url="?curid=1273765" title="Cerberin">
<text>Cerberin is a type of cardiac glycoside, found in the seeds of the dicotyledonous angiosperm genus &quot;Cerbera&quot;; including the suicide tree (&quot;Cerbera odollam&quot;) and the sea mango (&quot;Cerbera manghas&quot;). As a cardiac glycoside, cerberin disrupts the function of the heart by blocking its sodium and potassium ATPase. Cerberin can be used as a treatment for heart failure and arrhythmia.

Overconsumption of cerberin results in poisoning. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia, often leading to death. Cerberin containing plants such as &quot;Cerbera odollam&quot; have historically been used for suicide and homicide in their growth regions due to their high toxicity.

== Structure and properties ==

===Structure===

Cerberin, like all cardiac glycosides, has as its core a steroid-type set of four carbocycles (all-carbon rings). In cerberin, this steroid core is connected, first, to a separate oxygen-containing lactone ring (shown here, upper right of box), and second, to a sugar substituent (shown in infobox structure, left of image).

There are two types of cardiac glycosides depending on the characteristics of the lactone moiety. Cerberin, with its five-membered ring, belongs to the cardenolide class; cardenolides are 23-carbon steroids with methyl groups at positions 10 and 13 of the steroid ring system, and the appended five-membered butenolide-type of lactone at C-17.

Many types of sugars can be attached to cardiac glycosides; in the case of cerberin, it is an &quot;O&quot;-acetylated derivative of α--thevetose, which is itself a derivative of -glucose (6-deoxy-3-&quot;O&quot;-methyl-α--glucopyranose). The cardenolide substructure to which the sugar is attached has also been independently characterised, and can be referred to as digitoxigenin (see image), hence, cerberin is, synonymously, (-2′-&quot;O&quot;-acetylthevetosyl)digitoxigenin. As well, the non-acetylated structure was independently discovered and named neriifolin, and so cerberin is, synonymously, 2′-acetylneriifolin.

=== Physical properties ===
Cerberin is slightly soluble in chloroform and methanol. It is white to pale yellow in color.

== Toxicity ==
The literature on cerberin toxicity, per se, remains sparse; unless otherwise specifically indicated, the following is general information regarding cardiac glycoside toxicity, with an emphasis on information from cardenolides (i.e., steroid natural products bearing the same digitoxigenin substructure).

A historic, reported lethal dose of cerberin in dog is 1.8 mg/kg, and in cat 3.1 mg/kg; that is, it is very low. However, toxicity in humans is variable. One study showed that with treatment, humans could survive dosages of 1/2 kernel 94% of the time, 1 kernel 92% of the time, 2 kernels 71% of the time, and 4 kernels 67% of the time. Deaths were also variable when cerberin was used for trials by ordeal.

===Symptoms===
Those who ingest cerberin experience, within an hour, a variety of gastrointestinal and cardiac symptoms, particularly nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bradycardia. Forensic sources indicate presentations for cardiac toxin poisonings that additionally include burning sensations in the mouth, diarrhea, headache, dilated pupils, irregular beating of the heart, and drowsiness; coma and death most often eventually follow. There is no clear, reported correlation between the dose and mortality (see above); death often occurs after 3–6 hours.

===Poisonings===
There is significant evidence from &quot;Cerbera&quot; with regard to lethal poisonings. Individual cases of poisoning from &quot;Cerbera&quot; are documented including direct and indirect, and intentional and unintentional ingestion. Cases of human fatalities from consumption of crab where the crustacean had earlier consumed plants producing cerberin or related cardenolides are known.

Aside from accidental poisoning, cerberin has also been used for suicide and homicide. For example, a 2004 study found that Cerbera odollam was responsible for an average of one suicide death per week between 1989 and 1999 in Kerala, India. It was also the cause of 50% of plant poisoning cases and 10% of all poisonings in that region.

Cerberin is ideal for use as a poison because it is fast acting, its flavor is easy to mask when added to food, and it is relatively undetectable because there is only one analytical test to determine its presence in tissues after death.

== Mechanism of action ==

There is very little formal, modern published information on the mechanism of action of cerberin.

Cerberin, as a cardiac glycoside, is seen as binding to and inhibiting the cellular Na+/K+ -ATPase, because it binds to the alpha-subunit of the enzyme. This is the catalytic moiety. There are also a beta- and FXYD subunits. These two subunits influence the affinity of cerberin to Na+/K+ -ATPase. The expression of the beta- and FXYD-subunit is tissue-specific. Because of this, cerberin will have different effects in different tissues. When cerberin binds to the Na+/K+-ATPase the conformation of the enzyme changes. This will lead to the activation of signal transduction pathways in the cell. A detailed description of the effects of cerberin in the cell is given below.

=== Na+/K+-ATPase pump ===
Na+/K+-ATPase is an ion transport system of sodium and potassium ions and requires energy. It is often used in many types of cellular systems. Sodium ions move out of the cell and potassium ions enter the cell (3:2) with the aid of this pump. During the transport of these ions, the enzyme undergoes several changes in conformation. Including a phosphorylation and dephosphorylation step.

The transport of Na+ and K+ is important for cell survival. Cardiac glycosides, such as cerberin, alter the transport of ions against their gradient. Cerberin is able to bind to the extracellular part of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump and can block the dephosphorylation step. Due to this inhibition it is impossible to transport sodium and potassium across the membrane and results in raising intracellular concentration of Na+.

=== Na+/Ca2+-exchanger ===
Accumulation of intracellular sodium ions cause an increase of intracellular calcium. This is because the calcium-sodium exchange pump’s activity decreases. The calcium-sodium exchange pump exchanges Ca2+ and Na+ without the use of energy. This exchanger is essential for maintaining sodium and calcium homeostasis. The exact mechanism by which this exchanger works is unclear. It is known that calcium and sodium can move in either direction across the membrane of muscle cells. It is also known that three sodium ions are exchanged for each calcium and that an increase in intracellular sodium concentration through this exchange mechanism leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. As intracellular sodium increases, the concentration gradient driving sodium into the cell across the exchanger is reduced. As a result, the activity of the exchanger is reduced, which decreases the movement of calcium out of the cell.

Thus by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase, cardiac glycosides cause intracellular sodium concentration to increase. This leads to an accumulation of intracellular calcium via the Na+/Ca2+-exchange system with the following effects:
* In the heart, increased intracellular calcium causes more calcium to be released, thereby making more calcium available to bind to troponin-C, which increases contractility (inotropy). 
* Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in vascular smooth muscle causes depolarization, which causes smooth muscle contraction.

The conformational change of Na+/K+-ATPase plays not only a role in the contraction of muscles, but also in cell growth, cell motility and apoptosis. Due to de binding of cerberin, specific second messengers can be activated. After a cascade of cellular interactions nuclear transcription factors binds to the DNA and new enzymes will be made. This enzymes can for example play a role in cell proliferation.[subscription required]

===Metabolism===
Very little is known about the metabolism of cerberin. For the related digoxin, another cardiac glycoside, it is in largest part excreted unchanged by the kidneys (60-80%), with the remaining mostly metabolised by the liver. The half-life for digoxin is 36–48 hours for people with a normal renal function and up to 6 days for people with a compromised renal function. This makes the renal function an important factor in the toxicity of digoxin and perhaps for cerberin as well.

== Efficacy ==
There is very little formal, modern published information on the pharmacological actions of cerberin. One primary source reports that its ingestion results in electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as various types of bradycardia (e.g., sinus bradycardia), AV dissociation, and junctional rhythms; second-degree sinoatrial block and nodal rhythm are also described.

In the case of digitalis administration, ST depression or T wave inversion may occur without indicating toxicity; however, PR interval prolongation indicate toxicity.

== Therapeutic uses ==

There are no clearly established therapeutic uses of the title compound, cerberin. Digitalis compounds, related cardiac glycosides, function through the inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase-pump, and have been widely used for in the treatment of chronic heart failure and arrhythmias; although newer and more efficacious treatments for heart failure are available, digitalis compounds are still used. Some cardiac glycosides have been shown to have antiproliferative and apoptotic effects, and are therefore of interest as potential agents in cancer chemotherapy; there is a single report to date of possible antiproliferative activity of cerberin.

<text>Antwaan Randle El (; born August 17, 1979) is an American professional football coach and former player who currently serves as the wide receivers coach and assistant head coach for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football as a quarterback for the Indiana Hoosiers, earning first-team All-American honors in 2001. He also played basketball and baseball for the Hoosiers. He was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 2002 NFL draft. Playing with the Steelers for four seasons as a wide receiver and return specialist, he was active in all 64 regular season games with 23 starts. He was also instrumental in a number of trick plays, including throwing a touchdown pass as a wide receiver for the Steelers in Super Bowl XL.

After the 2005 NFL season, Randle El was signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins, where he scored ten touchdowns, catching eight and throwing two. In 2007, Randle El was sidelined for a game against the Buffalo Bills with a hamstring injury. This was the only inactive game of his NFL career.

Randle El was released by the Redskins in March 2010, re-signing with the Steelers shortly after. Randle El was also named fifth in &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s All-Decade kick returners.

For a time, he was also a sideline reporter for the Big Ten Network for interconference games that the Indiana football team plays.

==Early life==
Randle El was born in Riverdale, Illinois as the son of Curtis Randle El Sr., a food distributor, and Jacqueline, a day-care provider. Randle El was raised a Pentecostal Christian. A Chicago Bears fan, he attended Thornton Township High School in Harvey, Illinois, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He was a high school teammate of former NFL linebacker Napoleon Harris, as well as NBA center Melvin Ely and former NFL wide receiver Tai Streets.

After graduating from Thornton Township in 1997, Randle El was drafted in the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft, selected in the 14th round (424th overall) by the Chicago Cubs. He opted instead to pursue a football scholarship at Indiana University, despite being told he was too small during the recruiting process.

==College career==
Randle El attended Indiana University Bloomington from 1997 to 2001, playing college football primarily as a quarterback. Due to a low SAT score, he sat out his first full technical year at Indiana as a partial academic qualifier. Playing for the first time in Indiana&#x27;s 1998 season opener against the Western Michigan Broncos, Randle El completed 22-of-29 passing attempts for 385 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, as well as rushing for 82 yards on 23 carries for three touchdowns. The Hoosiers would go on to win the game, 45–30, with Randle El&#x27;s 467 yards breaking the NCAA freshman total offense record in his first collegiate game. His performance was also the third all-time highest passing yards in a single game for Indiana, and would earn Randle El the co-Big Ten Player of the Week award. In the same season, Randle El would lead the team to victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes on October 17, 1998, with a rushing touchdown in the final seconds of the game. The win came after a 62–0 loss to Iowa the previous season, making Indiana the first team in the history of the Big Ten Conference to lose to a team by more than 60 points in one season, and beat them the following year. Randle El would win the Big Ten Player of the Week award for a second time for his performance. On December 1, 1998, Randle El was announced as the winner of the 1998 Big Ten Freshman of the Year award, voted for by both Conference coaches and the media. The award was later re-titled the &quot;Thompson-Randle El Freshman of the Year&quot; award, partly in honor of Randle El&#x27;s successful college career. Over the course of the 1998 season, Randle El tallied four 100-yard rushing games, against the Minnesota Golden Gophers, the Michigan Wolverines, the Michigan State Spartans, and the Cincinnati Bearcats. He finished the season and his freshman year with 1,745 passing yards and six touchdowns, as well as 873 yards rushing as a quarterback, breaking the Indiana University season record.

While at Indiana, Randle El became the first player in NCAA Division I history to pass for 40 career touchdowns and score 40 career rushing touchdowns. In 2001, he was awarded the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Silver Football, presented by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; to the Most Valuable Player of the Big Ten Conference. He finished his collegiate career as fifth on the all-time NCAA total yardage list, and became the first player in college football history to record 2,500 total yards for each of four consecutive years. Tallying 7,469 passing yards, 3,895 rushing yards, and 92 touchdowns running and passing for his college career, he finish sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting in his senior season. Randle El ended his college career with a 26–15 win over the Kentucky Wildcats, passing for two touchdowns.

In 2000, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno said of Randle El, &quot;He is just the whole offense. It is scary to watch him. He is so quick that if you don&#x27;t get on him and you wait for him to pitch the ball, he will take off on you. He is just an amazing athlete. I don&#x27;t know how you get ready for him.&quot;

While attending Indiana, Randle El also played varsity basketball under Hall of Fame head coach Bob Knight. Randle El joined the 1998–99 Indiana basketball team following the football season. In the 1998–99 season, Randle El played 11 games for the basketball team, averaging 1.5 points and 0.7 rebounds in 6.7 minutes per game. He also played varsity baseball during the 2000 season for Indiana University.

In November 2012, Randle El was inducted into the Indiana Athletic Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
===Pittsburgh Steelers (first stint)===
Randle El was selected as a wide receiver in the second round of the 2002 NFL draft with the 62nd overall pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was the ninth wide receiver to be selected in the 2002 NFL Draft. He earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his game against Baltimore in Week 8. As a rookie, he had 47 receptions for 489 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns. He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team.

In Week 8 of the 2003 season, Randle El earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his game against St. Louis. He had an 84-yard punt return for a touchdown in the game. In the 2003 season, Randle El finished with 37 receptions for 364 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.

The Steelers made him their top kickoff returner through the 2004 season, and their top punt returner. In Week 15, against the New York Giants, he threw his first professional touchdown pass on a 10-yard catch by Verron Haynes.

He was the third non-quarterback and the first wide receiver in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl.

===Washington Redskins===
During the free agency period in March 2006, Randle El signed a seven-year deal with the Washington Redskins, worth $31 million with $11.5 million in bonuses. He had initially been in talks to sign a six-year, $18 million contract with the Chicago Bears, but discussions had broken down following the first day of free agency. In the Redskins&#x27; Week 7 game against the Indianapolis Colts, he returned a punt 87 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter, his first punt return for a touchdown with the Redskins, then in Week 17, he passed for his first touchdown as a Redskin, completing a 48-yard pass to wide receiver Santana Moss. In the 2006 season, he finished with 32 receptions for 351 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns.

In the 2007 season opener against the Miami Dolphins, Randle El recorded five receptions for a career-high 162 yards.

In addition, he was the Redskins&#x27; emergency quarterback. In December 2007, Randle El was inactive in a loss to Buffalo with a hamstring injury.

He was also named fifth in &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s All-Decade kick returners. Randle El was among ten players released by the Redskins on March 4, 2010. The move came as a result of a number of personnel changes in Washington, with new head coach and executive vice president Mike Shanahan – signed alongside new offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan – opting to make room in the Redskins&#x27; depth chart and salary outgoings in preparation of the 2010 free agency period. Randle El stated that he was &quot;shocked&quot; at the move, commenting that &quot;with a new GM and a new coach, I thought you&#x27;d be given a shot to show them what you can do.&quot;

In Week 9, Randle El threw for a touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace in a win over the Cincinnati Bengals, following a hand-off from Ben Roethlisberger. Randle El threw for a second passing touchdown in the Steelers&#x27; final regular season game against the Cleveland Browns, completing a pass to Hines Ward. The pass added to his career passer rating of 157.5 from 21 completed passes of a possible 26, the highest career rating of any player with more than twenty completions. Randle El scored a rushing two-point conversion in Super Bowl XLV to bring the Steelers to within three points of Green Bay in the fourth quarter. He was released by the team on July 28, 2011.

<doc id="1273771" wikidata="Q106712" url="?curid=1273771" title="August Belmont">
<text>August Belmont Sr. (born Aaron Schönberg; December 8, 1813November 24, 1890) was a German-American financier, diplomat, and politician. He served as Chair of the Democratic National Committee from 1860 to 1872. He was also a thoroughbred racehorse owner and the founder and namesake of the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown of American Thoroughbred horse racing.

==Early life==
He was born as Aaron or Aron Schönberg on December 8, 1813, to a Jewish family in the village of Alzey, which was shortly annexed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse after the Napoleonic Wars. His father, Simon Belmont was the owner of a freehold estate and leading citizen of Alzey, serving as president of the local synagogue for many years. His paternal ancestors were Spanish Jews who fled the Iberian peninsula during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. At a young age, his parents began calling him August, the name he used throughout his life. His mother, Frederika Elsass Belmont, died when August was seven.

After his mother&#x27;s death, he lived with his uncle and grandmother in Frankfurt, where he attended the Philanthropin, a school founded by Mayer Amschel Rothschild, designed to integrate the city&#x27;s Jewish and Christian communities. When he was fifteen, he was forced to withdraw from the Philanthropin after his father failed to pay tuition. His relatives prevailed upon the Rothschild family, who were relatives by marriage of his grandmother and already leading European financiers, to train him for business. While training as an apprentice and running errands, he was tutored in French, English, composition, and arithmetic. In 1832, his training was rewarded with an appointment as confidential clerk; two years later, he became secretary and traveling companion to one of the firm&#x27;s partners, which led to his first trip outside Germany to Paris, Naples, and the Vatican City.

==Business career==
In 1837, the Rothschild branches in Paris and London became concerned with their holdings in the Spanish Empire, which had been destabilized by the Carlist War. They sent Belmont to sail for Cuba via New York City. Reaching New York amid the Panic of 1837, he learned that the Rothschilds&#x27; American agent, J.L. and S.I. Joseph &amp; Co., had collapsed under liabilities of $7 million. As the situation called for a response from Europe more rapid than communications technology permitted, Belmont acted on his own judgment to postpone his trip to Cuba and superintend the Rothschild interests in New York, establishing August Belmont &amp; Co. at 78 Wall Street. The Rothschilds eventually approved his decision, making him their permanent agent in the United States.
===August Belmont &amp; Company===
From 1837 to 1842, Belmont experienced instantaneous success, serving as disbursing agent, dividend collector, and newsgatherer for the Rothschilds and their customers. The new financial house also invested in foreign exchange markets, commercial and private loans, commercial paper, and handled deposits. Belmont&#x27;s European connections attracted private investment from corporations, railroads, and state and local governments. In the wake of the Panic of 1837, Belmont was able to use Rothschild credit to buy up wildcat bank notes, securities, commodities, and property at severely depressed rates, sometimes as low as ten cents to the dollar. Using early modern securitization techniques, he was a pioneer on Wall Street, rapidly shifting money and commodities in complex international spirals of credit New York City had not seen before. He was also considered a skilled arbitrageur, earning him the nickname &quot;King of the Money Changers.&quot; Within three years of his arrival in the city, he had amassed a personal fortune of $100,000 ($ in ), making him one of the richest men in New York and one of the three most important private bankers in the United States. He was still only twenty-six.

In the later half of the 1840s, Belmont&#x27;s autonomy from the Rothschilds grew, and their relationship declined somewhat. In 1847, the United States government granted Belmont &amp; Co. the right to transfer $3 million to Mexico as part of an indemnity paid for land seized in the Mexican-American War. He handled the transaction without taking a commission, hoping to generate goodwill with the government. However, when the government sought a $5 million loan soon after, Belmont won only half the amount he had bid in syndication with Corcoran &amp; Riggs. When he further lent the new California Territory 5 million pesos, the Rothschilds hinted they might publicly dissociate the transaction and discredit Belmont, but ultimately did not. When Belmont was tasked with mentoring Alphonse James de Rothschild on a visit to America in 1849, he privately told his sister he feared he was training his replacement; Alphonse ultimately returned to Europe to lead the family&#x27;s Parisian holdings.

During Belmont&#x27;s time abroad as a diplomat in the Netherlands, the business was operated by Charles Christmas and Erhard A. Matthiessen under the name Christmas, Matthiessen &amp; Company.

==Diplomatic and early political career==
Belmont was a lifelong member of the Democratic Party who first engaged in political campaigning in 1844, the same year he was naturalized as a citizen, by supporting James K. Polk for president in the hotly contested presidential election. The same year, he became the consul general of the Austrian Empire in New York City, representing the Habsburg family in diplomatic matters throughout the Mid-Atlantic States. He resigned the position in 1850 over objections to the regime&#x27;s policies towards Hungary, which had become a major cause célèbre in the United States, and his growing interest in American politics.

===1852 presidential campaign===

Around 1849, Belmont met John Slidell, a leading member of the Democratic Party in Louisiana, through the Union Club of the City of New York. By 1850, Slidell encouraged Belmont to enter politics. Belmont had voted for Democratic candidates since his naturalization in 1844, although most of his business acquaintances were nominal or active Whigs.

With Slidell, Belmont backed the nomination of former United States Secretary of State James Buchanan for president in 1852, hoping to unite New York in a coalition with the South. To avoid the appearance of Southern interference, Slidell chose Belmont to manage the New York campaign. At the time, New York Democrats were deeply divided into various factions over slavery, with anti-slavery &quot;Barnburners&quot; having bolted in 1848 to support the Free Soil Party candidacy of Martin Van Buren. Throughout 1851 and the spring of 1852, Belmont and Slidell worked to rally the factions to Buchanan, including by the purchase of the &quot;New York Morning Star&quot; newspaper, but they failed to overcome favorite son William L. Marcy or Lewis Cass in the New York delegation. Efforts to unite behind Marcy or Stephen A. Douglas at the 1852 Democratic National Convention also failed; Franklin Pierce was nominated as an unexpected dark horse. Belmont lent financial and political support to Pierce&#x27;s campaign, bringing sustained attack from the city&#x27;s Whig newspapers, which accused Belmont of using &quot;Jew gold&quot; from abroad to buy votes and maintaining &quot;dual allegiance&quot; to the Habsburg and Rothschild families. Belmont demanded a retraction of at least one &quot;Tribune&quot; story, but after he was rebuffed by Horace Greeley, he enlisted the Democratic &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Evening Post&quot; in his defense. The journalistic war of words became known within New York City as the &quot;Belmont affair.&quot;

===Minister to the Netherlands (1853–57)===
Pierce won the 1852 election easily and appointed Buchanan and Belmont to diplomatic posts in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, respectively. Belmont held the title of Charges d&#x27;Affairs at The Hague from October 11, 1853, until September 26, 1854, when the position&#x27;s title was changed to Minister Resident. He continued as Minister Resident until September 22, 1857. In this role, Belmont successfully negotiated two treaties with the Dutch government: a new commercial treaty permitting American access to the Dutch East Indies in 1855 and an extradition treaty in 1857.

====Ostend Manifesto====

Shortly after Pierce&#x27;s election, Belmont proposed to Buchanan a plan to purchase and annex Cuba through military and diplomatic pressure on the unstable Kingdom of Spain, along with financial pressure from the Rothschilds and other European banking houses which held Spanish government bonds and could threaten the government with bankruptcy. In the letter, Belmont proposed that President-elect Pierce could, through his ministers to London and the Bourbon monarchies in Paris and Naples, create a diplomatic climate favorable to Spanish capitulation. For Naples, he recommended himself; Buchanan endorsed the plan and proposed it to Pierce, omitting Belmont&#x27;s name. Belmont proposed the plan again to William Marcy upon learning that Marcy would become Secretary of State, adding that he was on good terms with the lover of Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies. He continued to lobby Buchanan, Marcy, and Pierce, directly and through friends, for the appointment to Naples, but it was ultimately given to Robert Dale Owen, and Belmont reluctantly accepted appointment to The Hague.

En route to The Hague, Belmont visited Buchanan and Lionel de Rothschild in London and &quot;several gentlemen of influence&quot; in Madrid. He reported to Washington that Spain was unstable and desperate for financial relief, but also proposed rebellion in Cuba as an alternative to a direct sale, if blocked by &quot;Castilian pride.&quot; In October 1853, Belmont requested from Marcy a &quot;secret fund of $40,000 to $50,000&quot; to bribe Spanish officials to support Cuban independence, and he opened backchannel negotiations with the Spanish Minister to The Netherlands, a personal friend who favored the sale. However, Spain–United States relations soured quickly, driven by the bellicosity of Pierre Soulé, the United States Minister to Spain, and the Spanish Revolution of 1854, which installed a government less disposed to sell Cuba. Under sustained pressure from Belmont and other expansionists, President Pierce proposed that Buchanan, Soulé, and John Y. Mason (the three leading American diplomats in Europe) deliver a report on the Belmont plan. Though Slidell proposed that Belmont participate &quot;on account of the Rothschild influence at Madrid and Paris,&quot; he was not present at their meeting in Ostend, Belgium on October 9, 1854. Their report to Secretary Marcy, which favored an invasion of Cuba in the even that Spain refused to sell the island, became known as the Ostend Manifesto. The Manifesto was swiftly doomed by its leak to the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and the victory of Pierce&#x27;s opponents in the 1854 elections.

==== Gibson affair ====
As chargé d&#x27;affaires, Belmont was tasked with negotiating a trade agreement which would allow American shipping in the Dutch East Indies; his efforts were diverted by an international incident over the arrest of American citizen and adventurer Walter M. Gibson for fomenting rebellion in the East Indies. Gibson had been arrested in 1851 for conspiring with the Sultan of Djambi to overthrow Dutch authority on the island of Sumatra. After he was acquitted on a technicality, the Dutch Minister of Justice overturned the colonial court&#x27;s decision and sentenced him to twelve years imprisonment. Gibson fled the East Indies for Washington, where he arrived in 1853 and appealed to the Pierce administration for protection. He also sought support in pursuing an indemnity claim against the Dutch government for his arrest and destruction of his ship. Secretary Marcy and American public opinion backed Gibson.

After initial resistance from the Dutch foreign ministry, the affair was inflamed in summer 1854 when Gibson, impatient with the State Department&#x27;s handling of the case, arrived in The Hague personally to pursue his claims, falsely representing himself to Belmont as a special diplomatic agent appointed by Marcy. Gibson&#x27;s presence undermined Belmont&#x27;s negotiating position and riled Dutch public opinion, which demanded he be arrested as a fugitive from justice. Belmont&#x27;s position was further weakened when he left the city for the mineral baths in Bohemia, citing rheumatism. While Belmont was on leave, Gibson stole his dossier on the case and left for Paris, where he further told American minister John Y. Mason that Belmont had appointed him special attaché. Gibson in turn represented himself around Paris as Mason&#x27;s first secretary, leaking stories to Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New York Tribune&quot; which attacked Pierce&#x27;s foreign policy by suggesting that Belmont utilized his diplomatic post as a banking house and was underwriting the Russian Empire in the Crimean War.

Though Marcy thereafter dropped the issue and proceeded to ignore Gibson&#x27;s claims, and both Marcy and President Pierce praised Belmont&#x27;s handling of the affair, the entire incident did further damage to Belmont&#x27;s public reputation in the United States. In addition to the &quot;Tribune&quot;, the Democratic &quot;New York Herald&quot; (which had turned on the Pierce administration politically, as the result of a patronage dispute) joined in anti-semitic and xenophobic attacks on Belmont for the remainder of his tenure.

=== Buchanan years (1857–60) ===
While at The Hague, Belmont strengthened his ties to James Buchanan, maintaining an active and flattering correspondence with his fellow diplomat. As President Pierce&#x27;s domestic popularity waned over his handling of the crisis in Kansas, Belmont expected Buchanan to be the next Democratic nominee and the likely President. Stateside, John Slidell organized members of Congress and bankers behind Buchanan for the 1856 nomination and lobbied Buchanan to resign from his post to openly stand as a candidate. He did in March 1856 and, after a visit to Belmont at The Hague, sailed home, where he was nominated and elected president. Belmont&#x27;s role in the 1856 campaign was a matter of historical controversy; major accounts inaccurate imply he was in the United States, contributing thousands of dollars and planning campaign strategy. Biographer Irving Katz notes that Belmont did not return from Europe until November 1857 and, though he certainly committed money to the Buchanan campaign, no evidence exists as to an exact sum. Regardless of his exact role, he was again a subject of scrutiny and attack from the domestic press, who sought to tarnish Buchanan&#x27;s image through connection to Belmont.

Though Belmont hoped to receive a promotion within the diplomatic corps, Buchanan and Lewis Cass, the new Secretary of State, offered him only another four years at The Hague; he declined and resigned his post. When he arrived in the United States, he found his party embroiled in a feud between President Buchanan and Senator Stephen Douglas, who denounced the proslavery Lecompton Constitution for the Kansas Territory, which Buchanan supported. Belmont, who considered Douglas a personal friend and the likely Democratic nominee in 1860, nevertheless publicly endorsed Buchanan&#x27;s stance in 1858, circulating a petition which urged Congress to admit Kansas into the Union as a slave state and defending the administration against &quot;&#x27;Black&#x27; Republicans and Know-Nothings&quot; in an Independence Day speech at Tammany Hall.

In 1858, Belmont lobbied to succeed Augustus C. Dodge as Minister to Spain, but his request was ignored by the White House, in part because Buchanan hoped to appoint John Slidell as Minister to France and felt he could not appoint both men to prominent posts. The decision has also been attributed to Belmont&#x27;s role in the Ostend Manifesto, which made him unsuitable for the sensitive post. The snub agitated Belmont, who broke with the administration permanently, and then broke with his wife&#x27;s uncle Slidell, after Slidell refused to relay an angry letter from Belmont to the President. Belmont&#x27;s switch from Buchanan to Douglas drew him into the more moderate &quot;Softshell&quot; faction of the New York party, which favored a pluralist, democratic approach on the issue of slavery. In October 1859, he joined with Samuel J. Tilden and others to organize the Democratic Vigilant Association, a predominantly mercantile group (especially those engaged in trade with the South) to combat &quot;atrocious disunion doctrines,&quot; including the abolition of slavery.

==Chairman of the Democratic National Committee==
===1860 conventions and election===
Belmont was elected as a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention. As before, Belmont&#x27;s presence in the Douglas coalition drew criticism, with placards claiming &quot;the Rothschilds have sent countless millions&quot; to buy the presidency. Even some Douglas supporters opposed Belmont, with Fernando Wood claiming that Belmont intended to betray the Senator, given his connections to Buchanan and Slidell. Belmont allayed any fears in a meeting with Douglas allies and ultimately became leader of the Douglas men in the New York delegation, a pivotal position at the convention.

Belmont attended the April convention in Charleston with his family and Salomon James de Rothschild as his guest. The convention descended into chaos over the party&#x27;s position on slavery, was disbanded, and was rescheduled for Baltimore six weeks later. In the meantime, Belmont advised Douglas on campaign strategy and gained the candidate&#x27;s support for a resolution to protect the rights of slaveholders in the territories. Belmont also funded Douglas rallies in New York City, aiming to raise funds and keep the Northern party united behind Douglas. Douglas expressed gratitude and invited Belmont to meet in Washington in advance of the Baltimore convention, where Douglas was easily nominated without Southern participation. Belmont was selected as to represent New York on the Democratic National Committee and then elevated as the Committee&#x27;s chairman; he would serve in the role for over a decade. Douglas biographer George F. Milton wrote, &quot;the Committee hoped [Belmont] could smite the Manhattan rock and cause campaign funds to flow.&quot; Belmont biographer Irving Katz additionally cites Belmont&#x27;s &quot;organizing ability, his immense energy, his unswerving loyalty to the Douglas standard, and his efforts to diminish intraparty friction.&quot;

Belmont is attributed with single-handedly transforming the position of party chairman from a previously honorary office to one of great political and electoral importance, creating the modern American political party&#x27;s national organization.

=== American Civil War ===
He energetically supported the Union cause during the Civil War as a &quot;War Democrat&quot; (similar to former Tennessee Senator Andrew Johnson, later installed as war governor of the Union Army-occupied seceded state), conspicuously helping U.S. Representative from Missouri Francis P. Blair raise and equip the Union Army&#x27;s first predominantly German-American regiment.

According to one version of events, Belmont also used his influence with European business and political leaders to support the Union cause in the Civil War, trying to dissuade the Rothschilds and other French bankers from lending funds or credit for military purchases to the Confederacy and meeting personally in London with the British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, and members of Emperor Napoleon III&#x27;s French Imperial Government in Paris. However, the evidence compiled by Mira Wilkins, in &quot;The History of Foreign Investment in the United States to 1914&quot; (Cambridge, Harvard, 1989) tells another story. She writes: “A Confederacy loan, issued in London in 1863 and marketed in London and Paris, was oversubscribed” (p. 103). Young Salomon de Rothschild was in the United States in 1859–1861 and was captivated by the American South. He wrote home on April 28, 1961, urging the Rothschilds to use their influence to have the Confederacy recognized. He saw the North as totally at fault” (p. 677 n. 90). The Confederacy loan “was also taken up in Liverpool, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. Stanley Chapman calls the loan to the Confederacy ‘perhaps the most audaciously successful loan of the century.’... John Slidell (the uncle of August Belmont&#x27;s wife) arranged the Confederacy loan. John Slidell&#x27;s daughter, Mathilde, married Baron Frederic Emile d’Erlanger who was involved in that loan; their son, Baron Emile Beaumont d’Erlanger would become the senior partner in Emile Erlanger &amp; Co., London (based on a family tree in the Belmont Family Papers, Columbia University)” (677 n. 94). In New York, Belmont helped organize the Democratic Vigilant Association, which sought to promote unity by promising Southerners that New York businessmen would protect the rights of the South and keep free-soil members out of office.

Remaining chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the War, Belmont presided over what he called &quot;the most disastrous epoch in the annals of the Democratic Party&quot;. As early as 1862, Belmont and Samuel Tilden bought stock in the &quot;New York World&quot; in order to mold it into a major Democratic press organ with the help of Manton M. Marble, its editor-in-chief.

According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1864, Belmont was buying up Southern bonds on behalf of the Rothschilds as their agent in New York because he backed the Southern cause. Seeking to capitalize on divisions in the Republican Party at the War&#x27;s end, Belmont organized new party gatherings and promoted Salmon Chase (the former United States Secretary of the Treasury since 1861, and later Chief Justice of the United States in 1864) for president in 1868, the candidate he viewed least vulnerable to charges of disloyalty to the Party during the Republican/Unionists Lincoln-Johnson Administrations, (1861–69).

=== 1868 and 1872 elections ===
Horatio Seymour&#x27;s electoral defeat in the 1868 election paled in comparison to the later nomination of Liberal Republican Horace Greeley&#x27;s disastrous 1872 presidential campaign. In 1870, the Democratic Party faced a crisis when the Committee of Seventy emerged to cleanse the government of corruption. A riot at Tammany Hall led to the campaign to topple William M. Tweed. Belmont stood by his party.

While the party chairman had originally promoted Charles Francis Adams for the nomination, Greeley&#x27;s nomination implied Democratic endorsement of a candidate who as publisher of the famous nationally dominant newspaper, the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, had often earlier referred to Democrats before, during and after the War as &quot;slaveholders&quot;, &quot;slave-whippers&quot;, &quot;traitors&quot;, and &quot;Copperheads&quot; and accused them of &quot;thievery, debauchery, corruption, and sin&quot;.

Although the election of 1872 prompted Belmont to resign his chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, he nevertheless continued to dabble in politics as a champion of U.S. Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware for the presidency, as a fierce critic of the process granting Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in the 1876 election, and as an advocate of &quot;hard money&quot; financial policies.

==Personal life==
As a young Jewish foreigner in New York, Belmont had few initial avenues for social advancement. The existing &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; elite, composed of older English-Dutch Protestants, disapproved of his extravagant lifestyle and tastes, while the established Jewish community in the city was largely Sephardic, and Belmont himself disfavored associations with the small, lower-class Ashkenazi community. His social companions were largely young rebellious men from well-to-do families; with these connections, he gradually began to introduce European cosmopolitan society to the United States. Belmont&#x27;s early romantic and social life in the United States also drew controversy and opprobrium. In 1840, he unsuccessfully courted the ballerina Fanny Elssler during her sensational tour of the United States; Elssler&#x27;s known reputation for promiscuity and her illegitimate child drew disapproval. In 1841, he was publicly accused of an affair with a married woman and responded by challenging the accuser to a duel, in which Belmont was shot in the hip.

On November 7, 1849, Belmont married Caroline Slidell Perry (1829–1892), whom he met that summer through her uncle John Slidell while vacationing at Saratoga Springs. She was the daughter of naval officer Matthew Calbraith Perry, captain and commodore in the U.S. Navy, later famous for his expedition to open the trading ports of Japan in 1853. The two were married in an Episcopal ceremony, and he henceforth no longer acknowledged his Jewish upbringing, though he did not convert, being ambivalent toward religion.

Together, they were the parents of six children, with three of his sons becoming involved in politics:
* Perry Belmont (1851–1947), U.S. Representative from New York (1881–88) and Minister to Spain (1888–89) 
* August Belmont Jr. (1853–1924)
* Jane Pauline &quot;Jennie&quot; Belmont (1856–1875), who died aged 19
* Fredericka Belmont (1856–1902), who married Samuel Shaw Howland (1849–1925), son of Gardiner Greene Howland
* Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont (1858–1908), U.S. Representative from New York (1901–03)
* Raymond Rodgers Belmont (1863–1887), a champion polo player

Belmont died in Manhattan, New York City on November 24, 1890, from pneumonia. His funeral was held at the Church of the Ascension in New York City.

The &quot;Letters, Speeches and Addresses of August Belmont&quot; was published at New York in 1890. Belmont left an estate valued at more than ten million dollars (equivalent to $ million in ). He is buried in an ornate sarcophagus in the Belmont family plot (along with other Belmonts, Perrys and Tiffanys) in the Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island. His widow died in 1892.

His home, &quot;By-the-Sea&quot; in Newport, Rhode Island, was demolished in 1946.

===Sportsman===
He was an avid sportsman, and the famed Belmont Stakes thoroughbred horse race is named in his honor. It debuted at Jerome Park Racetrack, owned by Belmont&#x27;s friend, Leonard Jerome (the maternal grandfather of Winston Churchill). The Belmont Stakes is part of thoroughbred horse racing&#x27;s Triple Crown and takes place at Belmont Park racetrack, just outside New York City. Belmont was heavily involved in Thoroughbred horse racing. He served as the president of the National Jockey Club from 1866 to 1887 and owned the Nursery Stud (a horse-breeding farm near Babylon, New York, on Long Island), which in 1885 was replaced by a stud farm of the same name near Lexington, Kentucky.

==Legacy==

Belmont, New Hampshire, is named in his honor, an honor he never acknowledged.

The Liberty ship was named in his honor.

In 1910, sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward completed a bronze statue of a seated Belmont. The statue was originally installed in front of a small chapel adjacent to the Belmont burial plot in the Island Cemetery. It was later moved to a park between Washington Square and Touro Street in Newport. It was replaced by a marker dedicating the park as Eisenhower Park in 1960, to honor President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The statue was loaned by the city of Newport to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1985. It was eventually installed, about 1995, in front of the headquarters building for the Preservation Society of Newport County at the corner of Bellevue and Narragansett Avenues in Newport.

==In popular culture==
Author Edith Wharton reputedly modeled the character of Julius Beaufort in her novel &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; on Belmont.

In &quot;The Impeachment of Abraham Lincoln&quot; by Stephen L. Carter, August Belmont appears as a character.

<text>The Combahee River ( ) is a short blackwater river in the southern Lowcountry region of South Carolina formed at the confluence of the Salkehatchie and Little Salkehatchie rivers near the Islandton community of Colleton County, South Carolina. Part of its lower drainage basin combines with the Ashepoo River and the Edisto River to form the ACE Basin. The Combahee empties into Saint Helena Sound near Beaufort, which in turn empties into the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
The river is named for its first inhabitants, the Combahee tribe of Native Americans. Europeans occupied the area as early as the 1680s, and so the Combahee and others of the Cusabo group are also known as Settlement Indians. Land was set aside for the Yemassee people along several rivers, including the Combahee. The Yemassee War of 1715–1717 saw skirmishes in the area.

On August 27, 1782, one of the last fights in the Revolutionary War took place along the Combahee River. The British made an attempt at foraging, which the Americans, headed by General Mordecai Gist and Colonel John Laurens, opposed. Laurens, the son of Henry Laurens, a former president of the Continental Congress, died in the action.

The Combahee River bordered and supplied the water for some of the largest, most productive rice plantations prior to the Civil War. It was the site of an important military incident during that conflict, the Raid at Combahee Ferry. This was a Union raid into the interior of South Carolina, which freed over 750 slaves. Harriet Tubman, an escaped slave herself, well known for leading others hundreds of miles to safety on the Underground Railway, led this endeavor on June 2, 1863. The bridge across the Combahee on US Highway 17 is the location today.

==Cultural legacy==
The Combahee River Collective was a Black feminist lesbian organization, formed in 1974 and named after the Combahee River Raid, where Harriet Tubman led 750 freed slaves to safety. The Collective was instrumental in highlighting that the white feminist movement was not addressing the particular needs of black women. They are perhaps best known for developing the Combahee River Collective Statement, a key document in the history of contemporary Black feminism and the development of the concepts of identity as used among political organizers and social theorists.

<text>Prince Theodor Rosetti (5 May 1837 – 17 July 1923) was a Romanian writer, journalist and politician who served as Prime Minister of Romania between 23 March 1888 and 22 March 1889, with two cabinets formed. Over his life, he also served several other roles within the judicial and government.

He is an aristocrat and member of the House of Rosetti. He was born in Iași or Solești, Moldavia. He was brother-in-law of Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza, the former ruler of Romania and was considered to be on the conservative pro-monarchy side of the government. Rosetti was one of the most important members of the Junimea literary society and was elected honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1891. He died in Bucharest at age 86 and was buried in the city&#x27;s Bellu Cemetery. Streets in Bârlad and Iași are named after him.

<text>Killynure () is a townland in County Down, Northern Ireland, lying on the south-east border of Carryduff. 

The townland is approximately 770 acres (3.1 km²) in area, and still consists mostly of farmland, although since the 1990s, the housing developments of Carryduff have begun to encroach on its north-west corner (including the Killynure Estate).

The &#x27;Church of the Yew&#x27; which gave the townland its name possibly existed in the 9th century, with the most probable site being at Flowe Farm on Killynure Road West. Local records record that a schoolhouse was constructed in 1795 on the site, re-using existing stone from a ruin in the field, which also contained several yew stumps. A couple of 3rd century Roman coins were also found nearby.

Killynure Road runs north-south through the townland, connecting Carryduff and Saintfield, passing close to the summit of Ouley Hill. Use of the road is attested as far back as the 17th century, and it formed part of the main stagecoach route between Belfast and Downpatrick. However, horses struggled ascending Ouley Hill, and in the latter half of the 19th century, a new road between Carryduff and Saintfield was constructed, bypassing the hill: this is still in use today as the modern A7.

Killynure Road West leaves the Killynure Road at Ouley Hill and runs westward, to meet the A24 road (which connects Carryduff to Ballynahinch).

Killynure Avenue, a small road which runs between the Killynure Road and the A7, leading to Lisdoonan townland, is lined with numerous ash trees.

The townland contains a few small streams which join the Carryduff River, ultimately flowing into the Lagan some miles north at Minnowburn.

<doc id="1273799" wikidata="Q3867498" url="?curid=1273799" title="Suspensory muscle of duodenum">
<text>The suspensory muscle of duodenum (also known as suspensory ligament of duodenum, Treitz&#x27;s muscle or ligament of Treitz) is a thin muscle connecting the junction between the duodenum and jejunum (the small intestine&#x27;s first and second parts, respectively), as well as the duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries. The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is quite variable.

The suspensory muscle marks the formal division between the duodenum and the jejunum. This division is used to mark the difference between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, which is relevant in clinical medicine as it may determine the source of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The suspensory muscle is derived from mesoderm and plays a role in the embryological rotation of the gut, by offering a point of fixation for the rotating gut. It is also thought to help digestion by widening the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare abnormality caused by a congenitally short suspensory muscle.

==Structure==
The duodenum and the jejunum are the first and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters the upper part of the mesentery, inserting into the junction between the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum.

===Variation===
Considerable anatomic variation exists, in terms of length and point of attachment. Despite the classical description, the muscle only solely attaches to the duodenojejunal flexure in about 8% of people; it is far more common, 40 to 60% of the time to attach additionally to the third and fourth parts of the duodenum; and 20 to 30% of the time it only attaches to the third and fourth parts. Moreover, separate multiple attachments are not that uncommon.

According to some authors, who use the original description by Treitz, the muscle may be divided into two sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the &quot;Hilfsmuskel&quot;. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the &quot;suspensory muscle&quot; referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.

==Function==
The ligament contains a slender band of skeletal muscle from the diaphragm and a fibromuscular band of smooth muscle from the horizontal and ascending parts of the duodenum. When it contracts, by virtue of connections to the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum widens the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure, allowing movement of the intestinal contents.

===Embryology===

Embryologically, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum is derived from mesoderm. It plays an important role in the embryological rotation of the small intestine as the superior retention band.

==Clinical significance==
This ligament is an important anatomical landmark of the duodenojejunal flexure, separating the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. For example, bloody vomit or melena, black tarry stools, usually indicate a gastrointestinal bleed from a location in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, hematochezia, bright red blood or clots in the stool, usually indicates gastrointestinal bleeding from the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is an especially important landmark to note when looking at the bowel for the presence of malrotation of the gut, a syndrome often suspected in young children when they have episodes of recurrent vomiting. Visualising a normal location of the ligament of Treitz in radiological images is critical in ruling out malrotation of the gut in a child; it is abnormally located when malrotation is present.

During a Whipple&#x27;s procedure, commonly used to treat pancreatic cancer by removing the pancreas, duodenum, and part of the jejunum, the ligament of Treitz is separated from the duodenum and preserved. When the remaining jejunum is anastamosed with the pylorus of the stomach, it may be passed through the ligament.

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMA) is an extremely rare life-threatening condition that can either be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and may—when congenital—result from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is &quot;Strong&#x27;s operation&quot;, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.

==History==
The suspensory muscle of the duodenum was first named in 1853 by Václav Treitz, as the &quot;&quot; (in Latin), and described as consisting of a lower muscular portion with a broad base, and an upper tendinous portion blending with connective tissue around the origins of the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries. It is commonly termed the &quot;ligament of Treitz&quot; by clinicians and as the &quot;suspensory muscle of the duodenum&quot; by anatomists. It has also been likened to &quot;a polar ice cap ... a structure that many refer to but few have seen.&quot;

<doc id="1273802" wikidata="Q4119186" url="?curid=1273802" title="Automotive industry in Iran">
<text>Iran’s automotive industry is the third most active industry of the country, after its oil and gas industry, accounting for 10% of Iran&#x27;s GDP and 4% of the workforce (700,000 people).

Iran developed a significant automotive industry with annual production of up to 200,000 units under the Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi&#x27;s regime. But after the Iranian Revolution of 1979 production drastically decreased due to Iran–Iraq War and international sanctions. Since the early 2000s, automobile production in Iran has grown exponentially. Iran&#x27;s automobile production crossed the 1 million mark in 2007/2008. Today, Iran is the 20th largest automaker in the world and one of the largest in Asia, with annual production of more than 1.6 million. In 2009, Iran ranked fifth in car production growth standing next to China, Taiwan, Romania and India. According to OICA statistics, production dropped dramatically to under 750,000 automobiles and commercial vehicles in 2013.

As of 2001, there were 13 public and privately owned automakers in Iran, of which two—Iran Khodro and Saipa—accounted for 94% of the total domestic production. Iran Khodro, which produced the most prevalent car brand in the country—the &quot;Paykan&quot;, which has been replaced in 2005 by the &quot;Samand&quot;—was still the larger with 61% of the market in 2001, while Saipa contributed 33% of Iran&#x27;s total production in the same year. Iran Khodro is one of the largest car manufacturers in Asia. It has established joint-ventures with foreign partners on 4 continents.

The Iranian manufacturers currently produces Several types of vehicles, including cars, 4WD, trucks, buses, minibuses, and pickup trucks. The sector directly employs about 500,000 people (roughly 2.3% of the workforce), and many more in related industries. About 75% of local output is passenger cars, with pick-ups the next largest category, accounting for around 15%.

In 2024 July Iran started allowing importing second hand Japanese, Korean and European cars limited to 1 exclusive vehicle purchase per citizen National id card number.

==Historical development==


In the 1960s, lacking the technical know-how and unable to produce its own automobiles, Iran invited Western firms in order to start a domestic automobile industry. Since then, Iran has developed its domestic industry where it can design and assemble cars on its own, including a new car factory in Kashan. The average operating margin of the five major Iranian automakers dropped by 1% from 13% to 12% in 2011. The seven development phases of Iran&#x27;s automotive industry have been:

==Market and domestic production==


In 2008, IDRO reported that SAIPA accounts for 54 percent and Iran Khodro for 46 percent of the output. Although carmakers are listed on the stock exchange, the government still owns about 40 percent of both companies. In July 2010, the government sold a further 18% stake in both Iran Khodro and Saipa for about $2 billion in total, bringing down its participation in both companies to about 20%. In August, both deals were cancelled by the Iranian Privatization Organization. No clear reason was given for the cancellation of the deals, but analysts believe that discontent over the prices at which the blocks were traded is the most likely reason. Unofficial estimates put the sector’s debt to Iranian banks as high as 100 trillion rials ($4 billion).

The other car manufacturers, such as Azhitechs, Bahman Group, Rakhsh Khodro, Kerman Motors, Kish Khodro, Raniran, Traktorsazi, Shahab Khodro, and others together produced only 6%. These automakers produce a wide range of automobiles including motorbikes, passenger cars, vans, mini trucks, medium-sized trucks, heavy duty trucks, minibuses, large size buses and other heavy automobiles used in commercial and private activities in the country. Iran Khodro Diesel has a dominant market share (+70%) in bus, truck and van production.

Iran with having a fleet of 7 million passenger cars, buses and trucks ranked the world’s 16th biggest automaker and one of the largest in Asia in 2006 with annual production above 1 million units and 1.3 million in 2009, resulting in almost 1.5 percent of total world production of vehicles and 1 car per 10 person.
Iran&#x27;s fleet reached 11.5 million cars by 2020 and 14 million by 2014 (half of which are dilapidated).

Sixty percent of passenger cars produced in 2008 will use natural gas as fuel or will be dual-fuel, and the remaining 40 percent will run on regular gasoline (2008). Some problems faced by the industry are slow deliveries of cars, lack of after sales services and low quality in the production of some cars. Car production in Iran has increased 445% between 1998 and 2008. In July 2013, sanctions imposed by the USA prevented Iranian companies from importing the vehicle parts upon which domestic cars rely; this caused Iran to cede its place to Turkey as the region’s top vehicle manufacturer. Because of sanctions on spare parts by France&#x27;s Peugeot and Renault, car production in Iran dropped by as much as 40% in 2012 before recovering somewhat in 2014 following the Geneva interim agreement.

More than half of the vehicles in Iran are over 10 years old (2009). The government has sought to upgrade the local fleet and the authorities aim to pull some 200,000 outmoded vehicles off the road each year, underpinning demand. According to estimates the demand stood at 1.5 million vehicles in 2007, which could not be met by the local producers. Auto manufacturing industry&#x27;s share in gross national product is two percent and Iran&#x27;s auto production rate in the global markets is 1.7 percent (2008). Previously buyers had been purchasing vehicles outright in cash, but now over half of all new car sales are through finance companies or on lease purchase schemes.

===Motorcycles===
There were more than 8 million motorcycles in Iran by 2010 and 1,500 motorcycles receive registration number plates each day. Motorcycles account for 30% of air pollution in Tehran. Domestically manufactured motorcycles conform to Euro 2 standard and they don&#x27;t even use catalyst transducers while the world has now considered Euro 5 standard for motorcycles.

===Exports===
In 2007, Iran car exports stood at around $500 million. Iran car exports reached $1 billion by March 2009. Overall production is expected to rise to 1.13 million units by 2012 ($200 million in exports expected by 2010) and 60,000 units exported by 2013.

==Auto parts==

&quot;Sapco&quot; and &quot;Sazeh Gostar&quot; are the respective purchasing arms of Iran Khodro and Saipa (the two largest Iranian auto manufacturers). The Iranian automotive parts industry consists of approximately 1200 companies (15,000 factories), which include those affiliated to vehicle manufacturers as well as independent firms. The industry consists of two primary sectors: Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) suppliers, which produce parts for auto makers, and After-Market Parts Manufacturers (AMPM), which produce replacement parts for vehicles. Over 39 countries purchase Iranian auto parts (2008). As of 2014, 10 tire manufacturing units are operating across the country with a production capacity of 240,000 tons per annum. They meet 70 percent of the domestic tire demand (11 million tires per year). As of 2015, 60% of auto spare parts in the Iranian market are imported from foreign countries. Most cars are produced in Iran under licence from foreign manufacturers and it depends on them for critical imports, ranging from pistons, cylinder heads, valves, starters, alternators, airbags to computer chips (incl. engine control units and sensors). The media has reported that the IRGC is cooperating with the auto industry ( including 32 domestic part makers) to remedy these deficiencies.

Since 2020, Iranian manufacturers are also producing parts such as automotive immobilizers, electronic control units, oxygen sensors, electric seats, electric steering, six-speed automatic transmission, polymeric materials, modulators, injectors, airbags, multimedia, direct current (DC) motors, all types of electrical sensors and digital front amplifier.

===Research and development===

There are different ongoing R&amp;D projects both at the governmental and private sectors. These projects research are mostly aimed at local market of Iran and its particular problems. New lines of locally designed and manufactured diesel, gasoline and dedicated CNG engines are being developed. There are also some research being done on hybrid and electric vehicles for the future Iranian market. In addition to this nanotechnology is being researched for introduction into production lines in order to improve the quality standards and customer satisfaction by offering anti-bacterial seats, anti-scratch paint, hydrophobic glass panes, maintenance-free air filters, anti-stain dashboards, nano-catalytic converters and nano-diamond containing lubricating oils.

In 2011, the Nanotechnology Initiative Council announced plans to export to Lebanon a series of ‘home-made’ nano-based engine oils manufactured by the Pishgaman–Nano-Aria Company (PNACO); these nano-based oils reduce engine erosion, fuel consumption and engine temperature. In 2009, researchers at Isfahan University of Technology developed a strong but light nanosteel as resistant to corrosion as stainless steel for use in road vehicles but also potentially in aircraft, solar panels and other products.

As of 2016, Iran had no known R&amp;D project in the important field of autonomous cars.

==Foreign direct investment and imports==

There are over 25 automakers in Iran, actively producing both light and heavy vehicles. They are in joint venture with companies such as Dongfeng (China), Peugeot, Citroen (France), Volkswagen (Germany), Nissan (Japan), Toyota (Japan), Kia Motors (South Korea), Proton (Malaysia), Chery (China) and many other established producers of light and heavy vehicles such as Renault (France), BMW, Mercedes Benz (Germany), Daewoo and Hyundai (South Korea) have emerged since 1991. Italian carmaker Fiat has also announced of plans to begin production of its Siena sedan in Iran in 2008.

Chery Automobile (China) in August 2007 entered into a US$370m joint venture with Iran Khodro, Iran to produce cars for West and South Asian markets. Chery Automobile is to hold 30% of the venture, and Khodro will hold 49%. Solitac, a Canadian front company, is to hold the remaining 21% of the venture. The factory will be in the Iranian city of Babol. Anhui Ankai Automobile (also of China) signed a deal in January 2008 with ARG-Diesel Iran to supply it with 600 buses, valued at €51.35m. The deal is to be complete by October 2008.

Iran annually needs some 4,000 buses for its domestic transportation. Since the 1970s, Iran has been producing a number of different buses, such as German Mercedes and MAN as well as Swedish Scania and Volvo that it has exported throughout Asia. Daewoo Bus Corp. and an Iranian automaker &quot;Ardebil Sabalan Khodrow-Maywan&quot; have teamed up to build buses in Iran. The plant, which is slated to be completed by March 2010, would have a production capacity of 2,000 buses per year and would produce some 800 city and intercity buses in the 18 months after its inauguration. Based on the agreement, the engines and gearboxes would be manufactured in South Korea. Production would increasingly shift to Iran, where about 60 percent of the parts would be made.

Since 2016 and the lifting of the international sanctions, nearly 40 foreign automakers, including Peugeot, Mercedes, and Toyota, are considering using Iran as a hub for their ME and regional exports.

===Imports===

Car imports have risen, from $184 million in 2002 to $1.5 billion in 2007.
In 2006, the government lowered the automotive import tariff levels to 90 percent for light weight vehicles and since then a huge influx of imported vehicles has been witnessed in the country. The tariff level for import of heavy vehicles is even lower at 20 percent, due to low levels of local production and high demand. As a result, various overseas brands are being presently imported into Iran.

Following the lifting of international sanctions, French car manufacturer Renault imported over 93,000 cars (fully built and CKD units) to Iran in 2016.

PSA covers 30% of the Iranian market, while Renault&#x27;s share is 5%.

==Fuel rationing==
, Iran has 3,200 gas stations for 1.5 million automobiles. Demand is supported by the fixing of fuel prices well below market levels. There are two pricing schemes for petrol, one subsidized the other not. Each month, qualified vehicle owners are allocated a specific number of subsidized liters of petrol (taxis have a significantly higher allocation). The cost of regular unsubsidized petrol in Iran is IR7,000/liter (approximately 37 US cents/liter) and premium grade petrol IR3000/liter, whereas the subsidized equivalents go for IR4,000/liter and IR5,000/liter, respectively. The nation&#x27;s abundant oil reserves have enabled the government to keep prices low (Iran is the second-largest exporter in OPEC). However, low prices have encouraged wasteful consumption and the smuggling of petrol into neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some 1.8 billion liters of oil products worth 10 trillion rials ($1 billion) are smuggled out of Iran per annum.

Given Iran&#x27;s limited refining capacity, there has been a shortfall in petroleum products in recent years, requiring Iran to import an estimated in 2006/07. As a result, there is a recognition among many policymakers of the need to raise prices, and gradual increases have been implemented. However, these have tended to lag the prevailing rate of inflation, and given that raising petrol prices is politically difficult the provision of cheap fuel is likely to persist in the medium term, encouraging the purchase of vehicles. The government was nevertheless forced to take action in June 2007 when it announced both a petrol increase to 12 cents/litre and the imposition of fuel rationing, much to the chagrin of vehicle owners. The policy, which allocates 120 litres maximum per month (following revisions in December) to private car owners, will run until end-2008/09.

===CNG===

In 2008 and 2009, Iranian government spent over 3 billion dollars on CNG infrastructure as part of its plan to convert its fuel policy from gasoline to CNG. Iran, with the world’s second-largest natural gas reserves after Russia, in 2011 became the world leader in natural gas vehicles with some 2.9 million on the road, narrowly edging Pakistan, which is trailed by Argentina, Brazil and India, respectively. (The United States, which does not subsidize and promote the fuel like other countries do, ranks 16th.) Iran has 1,262 vehicles per refueling station compared with 856 vehicles per refueling station in Pakistan.

==Prospects==

Like other sectors, the automotive industry is suffering from a lack of foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital imports. The privatization process is moving slowly (2008). Some 80% of state-owned firms were due to be privatized over the ten years to 2014, further to an amendment to Article 44 of the Constitution in 2004. In May 2014, Tasnim News Agency quoted Abdollah Pouri Hosseini, the head of the Iran Privatization Organization, as saying that Iran would be privatizing 186 state-run companies in the new year (beginning 21 March 2014 in Iran). He said that 27 of these companies had a market value each in excess of US$400 million. In 2010, the government reduced its participation in Iran Khodko and Saipa to about 20% but the deals were annulled the same year by the Iranian Privatization Organization.

International sanctions, high inflation, exacerbated by fuel price hikes, and dampened consumer demand have depressed growth in the passenger car segment, but industrial growth coupled with infrastructural development is spurring demand in the commercial vehicles segment. The sanctions have also created difficulties for the imports of spare parts and increased the cost for car manufacturers. To make matters worse, the factory sale prices of cars, which are set by the government every year, have changed very little since 2006. Experts also believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector until 2013.

The sanctions imposed in 2013 hit exports particularly hard, which had doubled to about 50,000 cars between 2011 and 2012. This prompted IKCO to announce plans in October 2013 to begin selling 10 000 cars a year to the Russian Federation. Traditional export markets include Syria, Iraq, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Venezuela, Pakistan, Cameroon, Ghana, Senegal and Azerbaijan.

According to a 2015-survey, car production in Iran will increase by 28% increase following the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

In 2015, the government made loans up to $7120 available for purchase of domestic cars (with an interest rate of between 16-18%). The payback period is a maximum seven years or 84 installments.

<text>Visigothic script was a type of medieval script that originated in the Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula). Its more limiting alternative designations &quot;littera toletana&quot; and &quot;littera mozarabica&quot; associate it with scriptoria specifically in Toledo and with Mozarabic culture more generally, respectively.

The script, which exists in book-hand and cursive versions, was used from approximately the late seventh century until the thirteenth century, mostly in Visigothic Iberia but also somewhat in the Catalan kingdom in current southern France. It was perfected in the 9th–11th centuries and declined afterwards. It developed from uncial script, and shares many features of uncial, especially an uncial form of the letter .
Other features of the script include an open-top (very similar to the letter ), similar shapes for the letters and , and a long letter resembling the modern letter . There are two forms of the letter , one with a straight vertical ascender and another with an ascender slanting towards the left. The top stroke of the letter , by itself, has a hook curving to the left; also has a number of other forms when used in ligatures, and there are two different ligatures for the two sounds of (“hard” or unassibilated and &quot;soft&quot; or sibilated) as spoken in Hispano-Latin during this period. The letters and also have many different forms when written in ligature. Of particular interest is the special Visigothic z , which, after adoption into Carolingian handwriting, eventually transformed into the c-cedilla .
A capital-letter display script was developed from the standard script, with long slender forms. There was also a cursive form that was used for charters and non-religious writings, which had northern (&quot;Leonese&quot;) and southern (&quot;Mozarabic&quot;) forms. The Leonese cursive was used in the Christian north, and the Mozarabic was used by Christians living in the Muslim south. The cursive forms were probably influenced by Roman cursive, brought to Iberia from North Africa.

Visigothic script has many similarities with Beneventan script and Merovingian script.

<doc id="1273823" wikidata="Q2984269" url="?curid=1273823" title="Curonian colonization of the Americas">
<text>The Curonian colonization of the Americas was performed by the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (now Latvia), which was the second-smallest state to colonise the Americas, after the Knights of Malta. It had a colony on the island of Tobago from 1654 to 1659 and intermittently from 1660 to 1689.

==History==
Courland and Semigallia was located in present-day Latvia, and had a population of only 200,000, mostly of Latvian and Baltic German ancestry, and was itself a vassal of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at that time. Under Duke Jacob Kettler (ruled 1642-1682), a Baltic German, it established one of the largest merchant fleets in Europe, with its main harbours in Windau (today&#x27;s Ventspils), and Libau (today&#x27;s Liepāja). During his travels to Western Europe, Duke Jacob became an eager proponent of mercantilism. Metalworking and shipbuilding became much more developed. Trading relations were established not only with nearby countries, but also with England, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and others.

===Courland and Tobago===
The Duchy&#x27;s ships started undertaking trade voyages to the West Indies at least as early as 1637, when a Couronian ship attempted to found a colony on Tobago with 212 settlers. An earlier European settlement on the island, a Dutch colony named New Walcheren, formed in 1628, had been wiped out a few months earlier by Spain. The first Curonian colony met a similar end, whilst a second attempt was essentially blockaded by Spain and strangled in infancy by 1639.

In 1642 two ships under Captain Caroon with about 300 settlers attempted to settle on the north coast near Courland Bay. This colony was again blockaded, but proved more successful. Jesuit missionaries among the Carib quickly agitated and armed the tribes to attack the settlement. In 1650 the colonists abandoned the colony, which was evacuated to Tortuga and later Jamaica. Under agreement with other Protestant powers who saw their various individual efforts insufficient to trade and/or colonise the Americas, Africa, and the Indies simultaneously, Courland&#x27;s attention shifted to Africa. In 1651 the Duchy gained its first successful colony in Africa, on St. Andrews Island in the Gambia River and it established Fort Jacob there.

Soon afterwards the Protestant powers felt sufficiently organised and prepared to launch several colonial expeditions against Spanish interests in the Caribbean. The alliance between England and the Netherlands against Spain began to dissolve thanks to England&#x27;s attempts to break Dutch monopolies. The Dutch were primary competitors to Courland, which decided to support the English in the brewing conflict. Therefore, Courland received permission from its Protestant English allies to make still another attempt at a colony on Tobago. 

On 20 May 1654, the ship &quot;Das Wappen der Herzogin von Kurland&quot; (&quot;The Arms of the Duchess of Courland&quot;) arrived carrying 45 cannon, 25 officers, 124 Curonian soldiers and 80 families of colonists to occupy Tobago. Captain Willem Mollens declared the island &quot;New Courland&quot; (&quot;Neu-Kurland&quot;). A fort was erected on the southwest of the island, also called Fort Jacobus (Fort James) with the surrounding town called Jacobsstadt (Jamestown). Other features were given Curonian names such as Great Courland Bay, Jacobs (James) Bay, Courland Estate, Neu-Mitau, Libau Bay and Little Courland Bay. 

In their first year on the island the Curonians built an Evangelical Lutheran church. The colony was successful, but the Netherlands was not willing to accede to losing the West Indies and replied by establishing its own colony nearby a few months later. Thus, the small Curonian colony soon became overshadowed by a second Dutch colony. While 120 Curonian colonists had come in 1657, the Dutch colony reached a population of 1,200 by the next year, when 500 French Protestant refugees fleeing Catholic persecution joined them.

Goods exported to Europe included sugar, tobacco, coffee, cotton, ginger, indigo, rum, cocoa, tortoise shells, tropical birds and their feathers.

The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia became a focus of strategic interest for both Sweden and Poland–Lithuania. In 1655 the Swedish army entered the territory of the Duchy and the Northern Wars (1655–1660) began. The Swedish army held Duke Jacob captive from 1658 to 1660. During this period both colonies continued to thrive until they were taken by the more numerous Dutch settlers, who surrounded Fort James and forced Hubert de Beveren, Governor of the Curonians, to surrender. The merchant fleet and factories were destroyed. Courland and Semigallia officially yielded New Courland on 11 December 1659. However, this war ended with the Treaty of Oliwa (signed near Gdańsk) of 1660, on the basis of which Tobago was returned to Courland. 

Although peace had been established between the Curonians and the Dutch, there still remained Spain. Following several attacks by buccaneers seeking new harbours, and an expeditionary fleet of Spanish vessels, the Curonians left Tobago in 1666. In 1668 a Curonian ship attempted to reoccupy Fort Jacobus and was driven off by the Dutch. 

Tobago was regained again just for a short period at the end of Duke Jacob&#x27;s rule with an attempt in July 1680 at a new colony which also later failed. He began to restore the fleet and factories, and the Duchy never again reached its previous level of prosperity. The island was abandoned except for visiting buccaneers from March 1683 to June 1686, before again being occupied by a collection of scattered Curonians from throughout the Dutch, French, and English West Indies, as well as by fresh settlers from the home country. 

In May 1690, shortly after the island was sold by Courland and Semigallia the previous year, the Curonian government permanently left Tobago, and those who remained essentially joined the buccaneers or other Anglo-Dutch colonies. Absentee governors would continue to be appointed until 1795, thereby facilitating the continued use of covert privateering Letters of Marque and Reprisal in the region.

The Courland Monument near Courland Bay commemorates the Duchy&#x27;s settlements.

==Governors of New Courland==

Jamaican buccaneers and English forces from Barbados invade by 1666 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War.

French forces from Grenada then capture the island.

The Dutch recapture the island by 1667 and Dutch settlers re-establish the colony by 1668.

The Nepoyo (Arawakans) from Trinidad attack the settlement, but they were able to fend off the attacks with the help of the native Kalina (Carib) of Tobago, but were attacked again by the Kalinago (Island Caribs) from St. Vincent.

At the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–1674), the colony was captured and looted again by Barbadians, where in 1673 Adrian Lampsins and the late Cornelius&#x27; son Jan briefly again retook Tobago, but the island was recaptured by an English Barbadian force under Sir Tobias Bridge from Barbados, and Adrian was killed alongside his nephew when the fort was blown up.

A new Dutch colony was re-established in 1676.

The French attack again by March 1677, with the resulting naval battle resulted in serious losses on both sides, and the French forces withdrew, but returned the following year, captured the island, and destroyed the settlement.

Fresh Courlander attempts to establish a colony in Tobago in 1680 and 1681 were abandoned in 1683.

New Courland is abandoned from 1683 to 1686.

A final Courlander attempt to settle the island in 1686 was largely abandoned by 1687.

New Courland is finally sold to the British Empire by around 1690 to 1693, where last mention of the colony was a small group of settlers encountered by a Danish ship in 1693.

<text>Kuks () is a municipality and village in Trutnov District in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 300 inhabitants. It lies on the Elbe river. Its main feature is a Baroque spa building with famous sculptures by Matthias Braun. The village with the Baroque complex is protected by law as a monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Kuks consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Kuks (187)
*Kašov (70)

==Etymology==
The name is probably derived from the Old German word for share of mining revenue. According to another theory, the word meant ore smelting remains.

==Geography==
Kuks is located about south of Trutnov and north of Hradec Králové. It lies on the border of three geomorphological regions: the lowlands of East Elbe Table and Orlice Table, and the undulating landscape of the Jičín Uplands. The highest point is at above sea level. The Elbe River flows through the municipality.

==History==
Before any settlement was established here, the area was used for gold panning. The Kuks village was founded after the spa was founded here. In 1684, the estate was acquired by Count Franz Anton von Sporck.

On the slope of the Elbe in Kuks, there used to be mineral springs. In 1692–1696, Count Sporck directed three of them at one place and built a simple spa. When the healing effects of the water were proven by professors of the Charles-Ferdinand University and experts from Baden-Baden, Sporck enlarged the spa.

In 1696, he had built Chapel of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, followed by chateau in front of it in 1710. In 1707–1715, the hospital and the Church of the Holy Trinity with the crypt were built. The interiors and exteriors were decorated with Baroque sculptures by Matthias Braun, the most famous of which are the &quot;Virtues and Vices&quot;. Behind the hospital there was a garden, and the whole complex was closed by a cemetery.

Sporck died in 1738 and his heirs were not interested in maintaining the spa. A flood in 1740 destroyed most of the infrastructure and put the spa out of business. Kuks turned into a quiet village with mostly German population. In 1896, the uninhabited chateau burnt down and in 1901, its ruins were demolished.

In 1938, Kuks was annexed by Nazi Germany and administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. After World War II, the German-speaking population was expelled and replaced by Czech settlers.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Kuks is located on the railway line Liberec–Jaroměř.

==Sights==

The hospital, church, and pharmacy buildings have been preserved, along with historic furnishings, and are considered masterpieces of the Baroque. The complex is nowadays owned by the state. Since 1946, the building of the hospital houses a museum of Baroque art and Czech pharmacy.

Braun&#x27;s exterior sculptures also survive, but have been fast eroding due to the action of water, from rainfall and moisture rising from the ground. For this reason, the Kuks Forest Sculptures were listed in the 2000 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. With the financial support of American Express, pump boxes were installed to drive groundwater away from the sculptures and low-lying vegetation was removed to enhance air circulation in the damp wooded environment.

==Notable people==
*Johann Balzer (1738–1799), engraver

<text>The external secant function (abbreviated exsecant, symbolized exsec) is a trigonometric function defined in terms of the secant function:

formula_1

It was introduced in 1855 by American civil engineer Charles Haslett, who used it in conjunction with the existing versine function, formula_2 for designing and measuring circular sections of railroad track. It was adopted by surveyors and civil engineers in the United States for railroad and road design, and since the early 20th century has sometimes been briefly mentioned in American trigonometry textbooks and general-purpose engineering manuals. For completeness, a few books also defined a coexsecant or excosecant function (symbolized coexsec or excsc), formula_3formula_4 the exsecant of the complementary angle, though it was not used in practice. While the exsecant has occasionally found other applications, today it is obscure and mainly of historical interest.

As a line segment, an external secant of a circle has one endpoint on the circumference, and then extends radially outward. The length of this segment is the radius of the circle times the trigonometric exsecant of the central angle between the segment&#x27;s inner endpoint and the point of tangency for a line through the outer endpoint and tangent to the circle.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;secant&quot; comes from Latin for &quot;to cut&quot;, and a general secant line &quot;cuts&quot; a circle, intersecting it twice; this concept dates to antiquity and can be found in Book 3 of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, as used e.g. in the intersecting secants theorem. 18th century sources in Latin called &quot;any&quot; non-tangential line segment external to a circle with one endpoint on the circumference a &quot;secans exterior&quot;.

The trigonometric &quot;secant&quot;, named by Thomas Fincke (1583), is more specifically based on a line segment with one endpoint at the center of a circle and the other endpoint outside the circle; the circle divides this segment into a radius and an external secant. The external secant segment was used by Galileo Galilei (1632) under the name &quot;secant&quot;.

== History and applications ==
In the 19th century, most railroad tracks were constructed out of arcs of circles, called &quot;simple curves&quot;. Surveyors and civil engineers working for the railroad needed to make many repetitive trigonometrical calculations to measure and plan circular sections of track. In surveying, and more generally in practical geometry, tables of both &quot;natural&quot; trigonometric functions and their common logarithms were used, depending on the specific calculation. Using logarithms converts expensive multiplication of multi-digit numbers to cheaper addition, and logarithmic versions of trigonometric tables further saved labor by reducing the number of necessary table lookups.

The &quot;external secant&quot; or &quot;external distance&quot; of a curved track section is the shortest distance between the track and the intersection of the tangent lines from the ends of the arc, which equals the radius times the trigonometric exsecant of half the central angle subtended by the arc, formula_5 By comparison, the &quot;versed sine&quot; of a curved track section is the furthest distance from the &quot;long chord&quot; (the line segment between endpoints) to the track – cf. Sagitta – which equals the radius times the trigonometric versine of half the central angle, formula_6 These are both natural quantities to measure or calculate when surveying circular arcs, which must subsequently be multiplied or divided by other quantities. Charles Haslett (1855) found that directly looking up the logarithm of the exsecant and versine saved significant effort and produced more accurate results compared to calculating the same quantity from values found in previously available trigonometric tables. The same idea was adopted by other authors, such as Searles (1880). By 1913 Haslett&#x27;s approach was so widely adopted in the American railroad industry that, in that context, &quot;tables of external secants and versed sines [were] more common than [were] tables of secants&quot;.

In the late-19th and 20th century, railroads began using arcs of an Euler spiral as a track transition curve between straight or circular sections of differing curvature. These spiral curves can be approximately calculated using exsecants and versines.

Solving the same types of problems is required when surveying circular sections of canals and roads, and the exsecant was still used in mid-20th century books about road surveying.

The exsecant has sometimes been used for other applications, such as beam theory and depth sounding with a wire.

In recent years, the availability of calculators and computers has removed the need for trigonometric tables of specialized functions such as this one. Exsecant is generally not directly built into calculators or computing environments (though it has sometimes been included in software libraries), and calculations in general are much cheaper than in the past, no longer requiring tedious manual labor.

== Catastrophic cancellation for small angles ==

Naïvely evaluating the expressions formula_7 (versine) and formula_8 (exsecant) is problematic for small angles where formula_9 Computing the difference between two approximately equal quantities results in catastrophic cancellation: because most of the digits of each quantity are the same, they cancel in the subtraction, yielding a lower-precision result.

For example, the secant of is , with the leading several digits wasted on zeros, while the common logarithm of the exsecant of is , all of whose digits are meaningful. If the logarithm of exsecant is calculated by looking up the secant in a six-place trigonometric table and then subtracting , the difference has only 3 significant digits, and after computing the logarithm only three digits are correct, . For even smaller angles loss of precision is worse.

If a table or computer implementation of the exsecant function is not available, the exsecant can be accurately computed as formula_10 or using versine, formula_11 which can itself be computed as formula_12 Haslett used these identities to compute his 1855 exsecant and versine tables.

For a sufficiently small angle, a circular arc is approximately shaped like a parabola, and the versine and exsecant are approximately equal to each-other and both proportional to the square of the arclength.

==Mathematical identities==

===Inverse function===
The inverse of the exsecant function, which might be symbolized , is well defined if its argument formula_13 or formula_14 and can be expressed in terms of other inverse trigonometric functions (using radians for the angle):

formula_15

the arctangent expression is well behaved for small angles.

===Calculus===

While historical uses of the exsecant did not explicitly involve calculus, its derivative and antiderivative (for in radians) are:

formula_16

where is the natural logarithm. See also Integral of the secant function.

===Double angle identity===

The exsecant of twice an angle is:

formula_17

<doc id="1273845" wikidata="Q1076207" url="?curid=1273845" title="List of Catholic dioceses in the United States">
<text>The Catholic dioceses and archdioceses of the United States which include both the dioceses of the Latin Church, which employ the Roman Rite and other Latin liturgical rites, and various other dioceses, primarily the eparchies of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which employ various Eastern Christian rites and traditions, and which are in full communion with the Pope in Rome. The Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA is not a metropolitan diocese. The Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, with territory that extends over the United States and Canada, was established on January 1, 2012, for former Anglicans who join the Catholic Church.

The Catholic Church in the United States has a total of 196 particular churches in the 50 U.S. states, Washington D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands: 33 territorial archdioceses, 143 territorial dioceses, the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA (serving members of the US Armed Forces and Diplomatic Corps, and those in facilities of the Veterans Administration and their dependents), and the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter (serving Catholics who were formerly Anglicans) within the Latin Church; and two archeparchies and 16 eparchies in the Eastern Catholic Churches.

There are several other dioceses whose territories cover the United States&#x27; unincorporated territories. Puerto Rico has one ecclesiastical province comprising an archdiocese and five dioceses, which together form the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference, which is separate from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The dioceses that encompass American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam are part of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific.

== Terminology ==
The pastor of any particular church other than an ordinariate must be episcopally ordained, but his title conforms to that of his jurisdiction: the pastor of an archdiocese is an archbishop, the pastor of a diocese is a bishop, the pastor of an archeparchy is an archeparch, the pastor of an eparchy is an eparch, and the pastor of an exarchate is an exarch. The pastor of an ordinariate is an &quot;ordinary&quot; (which is a term also used generically for the pastor of any particular church) and may be either a bishop if celibate or a priest if married, but he holds the same power of governance of his ordinariate that an episcopal ordinary has in his diocese in either case; Pope Benedict XVI deliberately instituted this provision to permit married, former Anglican bishops who come into full communion with the Catholic Church along with many of their congregants to accede to office while respecting sensitivities in ecumenical relations with the Eastern Orthodox Churches, which also maintain a celibate episcopacy. The pastor of each particular church is, &quot;ex officio&quot;, a full member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Auxiliary and retired bishops are also members of the Conference but have no vote.

In the United States, each archbishop — except the archbishop of the Archdiocese for the Military Services — is also the metropolitan bishop of an ecclesiastical province. Likewise, each archeparch is also the metropolitan of an ecclesiastical province that encompasses all of the eparchies of the same &quot;sui iuris&quot; particular church in the United States. Most provincial and diocesan boundaries conform to state, county, borough (in Alaska), or parish (in Louisiana) political boundaries. The &quot;sui iuris&quot; Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the US has an ecclesiastical province consisting of an archeparchy and three eparchies, and the &quot;sui iuris&quot; Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church has an ecclesiastical province consisting of an archeparchy and three eparchies; the boundaries of these jurisdictions also generally conform to those of states. Most of the remaining eparchies are national in territory, but two particular churches, namely the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Our Lady of Nareg and the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, are international, encompassing all of the United States and Canada; their pastors also are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB).

In the Roman Rite, (arch)dioceses customarily take the name of the city of the (arch)bishop&#x27;s cathedra, denominated the &quot;see&quot;. A few dioceses bear the names of two cities, variously reflecting a shift in the major center of population, e.g., the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston; future plan to divide a diocese, e.g., the former Diocese of Reno-Las Vegas; union of two former dioceses, e.g., the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph; political expedience, e.g., the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis; or a perceived need for some episcopal functions to be accessible to residents of another part of the diocesan territory, e.g., the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown. Some of the &quot;sui iuris&quot; particular churches also follow this custom, while others denominated their jurisdictions after saints or other religious titles.

In the Catholic Church, there are many bishops who do not govern dioceses:
* A &quot;coadjutor&quot; is appointed to assist the bishop of a diocese or eparchy with its daily governance and has the right of automatic succession upon the death or resignation of the bishop. A coadjutor always holds the title &quot;Coadjutor of [name of see]&quot;. The coadjutor of an archdiocese or archeparchy also has the status of an archbishop or archeparch.
* A retired diocesan bishop holds the title of &quot;Bishop Emeritus of [name of see]&quot; or, in the case of an archdiocese, &quot;Archbishop Emeritus of [name of see]&quot;.
* Auxiliary bishops, bishops who govern jurisdictions that are not canonically erected as dioceses, bishops and archbishops of the Roman Curia, and bishops and archbishops of the diplomatic corps of the Holy See have titles of former dioceses and archdioceses.
* The Pope also may confer the personal title of &quot;archbishop&quot; on a diocesan bishop who does not govern an archdiocese; such a prelate is classified as an archbishop &quot;ad personam&quot;: although not the diocesan bishop of an archdiocese, he is titled with the name of a former archdiocese in addition to possessing the title of his own diocese. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, Bishop of Rochester and Titular Archbishop of Neoportus was one of the more famous examples of this custom.

When a diocese is suppressed or when the diocesan see is transferred to another location, the title of the former see becomes available for assignment to a titular bishop or, in the case of an archdiocese, a titular archbishop or an archbishop &quot;ad personam&quot;. The Vatican resurrected the names of many former sees of the United States in the 1990s, as indicated by the table of former dioceses toward the end of this article.

== Territorial provinces and dioceses ==

United States Conference of Catholic Bishops
Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference
Episcopal Conference of the Pacific

== Military archdiocese ==
Members of the Armed Forces of the United States and their dependents, employees of the US Veterans Health Administration and its patients, and Americans in civil service overseas, including the Nation&#x27;s diplomatic corps and their dependents, both Catholics of the Latin Church and Eastern Churches, are served by the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA. An archbishop leads it who is presently assisted by four auxiliary bishops. Its status as an &quot;archdiocese&quot; is merely honorary. In 1986, Pope John Paul II amended the juridical organization of military chaplaincies from &quot;military vicariates&quot; to &quot;military ordinariates&quot;, the head of which was likened to a diocesan bishop. The Ordinary of the Archdiocese of the Military Services is usually granted the personal title of &quot;Archbishop&quot;, although this is not a requisite of the office.

== Eastern Catholic eparchies ==

The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the United States is organized into a metropolia (province) comprising a metropolitan archeparchy and three suffragan eparchies.

The Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church in the United States is organized into the &quot;sui iuris&quot; Province of Pittsburgh, consisting of a metropolitan archeparchy and three suffragan eparchies. The eparchies also serve the faithful of other Byzantine Catholic Churches without established hierarchies in the United States, namely those of the Albanian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Greek, Hungarian, Italo-Albanian, Macedonian, Russian, and Slovakian Byzantine Catholic Churches. Since 2022, this province includes also the Slovakian Catholic Exarchate of Saints Cyril and Methodius of Toronto in Canada, which was formerly part of the Slovakian Greek Catholic Church.

=== Eastern Catholic eparchies in the United States immediately subject to the Holy See ===

The following particular Eastern Catholic Churches are not suffragan to metropolitan sees, but are instead exempt and therefore immediately subject to the Holy See, while they still remain part of their respective patriarchal, major archiepiscopal, or other rite- and tradition-specific particular churches.

=== Eastern Catholic eparchies comprising the United States and Canada, and immediately subject to the Holy See ===

Several Eastern Catholic Churches have jurisdictions that include members and congregations in both the United States and Canada.
== Personal ordinariate (Anglican Use) ==
Under the provisions of &quot;Anglicanorum Coetibus&quot; of 2009, an effort was underway to establish a personal ordinariate, or diocese, in the United States. The ordinariate was formed for former Anglicans, including members from the Episcopal Church, Continuing Anglican churches, and already Catholic Anglican Use parishes. The first such ordinariate established was the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham in the United Kingdom. The personal ordinariate encompassing the whole United States, the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, was instituted on January 1, 2012, in accordance with &quot;Anglicanorum Coetibus&quot;. It was later expanded to include Canada, and so its ordinary is admitted to the two countries&#x27; bishops&#x27; conferences.

<doc id="1273850" wikidata="Q3570246" url="?curid=1273850" title="Wythenshawe">
<text>Wythenshawe () is an area of Manchester, England. Historically part of Cheshire, in 1931 Wythenshawe was transferred to the City of Manchester, which had begun building a large housing estate there in the 1920s. With an area of approximately , Wythenshawe became the largest council estate in Europe.

Wythenshawe includes the areas of Baguley, Benchill, Peel Hall, Newall Green, Woodhouse Park, Moss Nook, Northern Moor, Northenden and Sharston.
==History==
The name Wythenshawe seems to come from the Old English &quot;wiðign&quot; = &quot;withy tree&quot; and &quot;sceaga&quot; = &quot;wood&quot; (compare dialectal word shaw). The three ancient townships of Northenden, Baguley, and Northen Etchells formally became the present-day Wythenshawe when they were merged with Manchester in 1931. Until then, the name was only used to refer to Wythenshawe Hall and its grounds.

Due to spending cuts, the hall was temporarily closed to the public in 2010. One proposition was that Manchester City Council could sell the building to the National Trust.
A Friends Group was formed to support monthly open days and events at the hall. In March 2016, the hall&#x27;s roof, one of its upper floors and its clock tower were severely damaged by a fire in an arson attack.

Immediately south of Wythenshawe is Manchester Airport, formerly called Ringway Airport. Before Ringway Airport was laid out, three farm fields between Rackhouse Road and Wythenshawe Road in Northern Moor, in what is now the north edge of Wythenshawe, were used as Manchester (Wythenshawe) Aerodrome. This was the UK&#x27;s first municipal airfield, operating between April 1929 and early 1930. A barn was converted to act as the hangar and a farmhouse as the administration building. Temporary fuel pumps were installed. The last recorded flight from Wythenshawe Airport was on 19 June 1930.
Wythenshawe was in the Church of England Diocese of Chester until 1933, when it was transferred to the neighbouring Diocese of Manchester.

Wythenshawe Bus Garage was built of reinforced concrete during 1939–42, designed by the Manchester City Architect, G. Noel Hill. It was taken over by the Ministry of Aircraft Production and A. V. Roe &amp; Co. Ltd. used it for building Lancaster aircraft during the Second World War. The building was Grade II* listed in 2001.

==Housing and social history==
Wythenshawe is Manchester&#x27;s largest district. The massive housing estate that was built there in the 1920s was intended as a &quot;garden city&quot;, where people could be rehoused away from industrial Manchester. In 1920, town planner Patrick Abercrombie identified the area as the most suitable undeveloped land for a housing estate close to the city, and of land was purchased.

Part of Benchill (not the area southwest of Gladeside Road) and some areas in the north were built before World War II and called the Wythenshawe Ward of the City of Manchester. The rest was built after the Second World War, starting in the late 1940s as wartime building restrictions were relaxed. Parts of Baguley were still semi-rural in the 1960s, but there is now very little open country left.

The estate was initially built without many shops, amenities or services, and there was very little employment available in the area. Although Northenden already had a shopping area on Palatine Road, the earliest new shops were built in the 1930s and included parades on Hollyhedge Road, and on Altrincham Road in Sharston (the latter was demolished in 1973 to make way for the M56 Sharston bypass). There were smaller local shops, such as a grocers—selling general household provisions, at Minsterly Parade (Woodhouse Park) and Haveley Circle (Benchill). However, it took decades for some areas of Wythenshawe to get their own neighbourhood shops, which meant residents had to travel or visit a mobile shop van when it visited their area. Various residents&#x27; associations were set up to address those problems, but progress was very slow.

After the Second World War, Wythenshawe eventually expanded, with several further shops being built (such as Haveley Circle, built in the early 1950s but demolished in the 1990s) and businesses were attracted to the area with the expansion of the Sharston Industrial Estate and, later, the Moss Nook and Roundthorn industrial complexes. Wythenshawe gradually acquired all the amenities and facilities that the original planners had neglected to include with the building of several new schools, shops, pubs, and churches. The area also got its own hospital, and Wythenshawe Hospital grew out of the earlier Baguley Hospital in 1948. The largest shopping area was built in the 1960s in the town centre, known as the Wythenshawe Civic Centre, which has been expanded further since it was first built. In 1971, the Wythenshawe Forum was opened there, which included a library, a swimming pool, a restaurant, a bar, and a theatre.

From the 1990s to the 2000s, the houses that were built and owned by the council were transferred to the control of local housing associations, such as Willow Park in east Wythenshawe and Parkway Green in west Wythenshawe. Both associations merged in 2013 to form the Wythenshawe Community Housing Group which is now responsible for around 14,000 homes in Wythenshawe.

In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the housing estates in Wythenshawe as representing an &quot;extreme pocket of social deprivation and alienation&quot;.

Most of the farm buildings in the Wythenshawe area were demolished when the estate was built. Some of them, like Hollyhedge Farm and Floats Hall, were left among the houses but suffered from vandalism and had to be demolished later. Some of the present housing estates were named after former farms.

Peel Hall Farm (which had a moat) survived for over 20 years as its occupant lived on the proceeds of selling his land, but soon after he left, the property was vandalised and had to be demolished.

Newall Green Farm survived on the edge of the Newall Green housing estate area and was still occupied and run as a farm until the early 21st century when its last occupant died, when it was abandoned and fenced off. The buildings are listed. In 2006, a firm bought Newall Green Farm&#x27;s buildings from Manchester Corporation. On 21 June 2014, vandals set fire to Newall Green Farm, and its roof was destroyed, but there are plans to turn the buildings into a care home for adults with learning disabilities, a working farm and a horse-riding centre.

==Parks==
Wythenshawe has twelve parks and 18 woodland areas including Wythenshawe Park, which was designated a Local Nature Reserve in 2011. It covers over of green space and is home to Manchester&#x27;s only community farm, Wythenshawe community farm. At the centre of the park is the historic Wythenshawe Hall with its Civil War and Tatton heritage. The park also has riding stables, a horticulture centre, children&#x27;s play area, athletics track, football pitches, tennis courts, bowls, and golfing facilities.

Other parks include Hollyhedge Park, Peel Hall Park, Painswick Park, and Baguley Park. Northenden&#x27;s Riverside Park is the first new park to be established in the city in the 21st century.

==Governance==
The district is under the authority of Manchester City Council.

Manchester Wythenshawe parliamentary constituency was created in 1950 and represented by Alf Morris of the Labour Party between 1964 and 1997. Before the 1997 election, the boundaries were redrawn and part of the neighbouring area of Sale was included in a new constituency, Wythenshawe and Sale East. Alf Morris was replaced by Paul Goggins. It is still considered a safe Labour seat, with Labour securing over 50% of the vote (and more than twice as many votes as its nearest rival) in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 elections. Labour kept the seat in the 2010 elections, though their share of the vote decreased to 44.1%. In early 2014, following the death of Paul Goggins, a by-election was held. Labour candidate Mike Kane (a Northenden councillor until 2008) won the seat with 55.3% of the vote, although voter turnout was low (28%). The 2017 general election saw the largest vote share for Labour in the history of both the current and former Wythenshawe seat with 62.2% of the vote and a 15,000 majority, although the 2019 election saw this fall back to previous levels with a majority of 10,396 and a 53.3% share of the vote.

At the 2001 UK Census, Wythenshawe was divided into six local government wards: Baguley, Benchill, Northenden, Sharston, Woodhouse Park and Brooklands (the latter being an area divided with the neighbouring borough of Trafford). Each ward was represented by three local councillors, giving Wythenshawe 21 of the 99 seats on Manchester City Council. Following a review by the Boundary Committee for England published in 2003, the ward of Benchill was abolished, and its former territory was divided between the wards of Northenden, Sharston, and Woodhouse Park.

Wythenshawe typically returns all Labour councillors in local elections, although in the 2008 elections the Liberal Democrats gained a seat in Northenden and a second seat (in the same area) in the 2010 elections. Labour regained these seats in the 2012 and 2014 elections. The Green Party have gained councillors in the Woodhouse Park ward in the 2021, 2022, and 2023
elections.

==Geography==
Wythenshawe is south of Manchester city centre and is the southernmost district of the city. Altrincham and Hale lie to the south-west, Sale to the north-west, Gatley and Heald Green to the east, and Manchester Airport to the south.

Shadow Moss is an area south of Ringway Road in the southeast corner of Wythenshawe. On this old map of Wythenshawe it is roughly the rectangular area between three country lanes with Heyhead at its northwest corner. On modern maps, its north edge is the southern branch of Ringway Road. It was partly in Northen Etchells township and partly in Styal parish. For many centuries it was a peat bog which was dug for peat fuel, locally called &quot;turf&quot;; local manorial law said that after digging peat the top living plant layer had to be lodged back to let more peat form afterwards. Each man&#x27;s allocated part of the Moss was called his &quot;moss room&quot;.

In the 19th century, manorial control was lost over what people used their moss rooms for, and an 1839 tithe map of Northen Etchells shows Northen Etchells&#x27;s part of Shadow Moss as about 2/3 arable, about 1/3 meadow, one field as pasture, and one field as &quot;uncultivated moors&quot;.

Later, the fertile lowland peat soil led to the area being much used for market gardening, with large areas under greenhouses. Of the people who worked there, many lived in Heyhead.

Around 1970, Heyhead was a small settlement at the south end of Woodhouse Lane and the nearby part of Ringway Road. It comprised several terrace houses, a small shop, two or more old cottages, a chapel, and the Ringway Haulage Company. Manchester Airport&#x27;s ground-level car parking has been displaced from other areas and car parks have been formed to the north and south of the runways and under the approach path. The Heyhead area has been progressively replaced by level car parks, and by 2011 all of Heyhead&#x27;s buildings had vanished (see History of Manchester Airport#Expansion).

Some greenhouses remain at the far east of the Shadow Moss area, but are used by private car parking operators. The last market gardener there, who grew tomatoes, closed in 2011 due to competition from highly mechanized greenhouse establishments elsewhere.

==Public services==
Wythenshawe is policed by the city of Manchester Division of Greater Manchester Police. Wythenshawe&#x27;s fire and rescue services are the responsibility of the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, and are based at a fire station on Brownley Road.

==Transport==
The M56 motorway, constructed in the 1970s as a continuation of the A5103 road (Princess Parkway), bisects east and west Wythenshawe. A bypass connecting it to the nearby M60 motorway was built through Sharston and opened in 1974.

The nearest railway station to Wythenshawe was located adjacent to Longley Lane at the edge of Sharston on the Cheshire Lines Railway from Stockport to Liverpool. Named &quot;Northenden for Wythenshawe&quot;, Northenden railway station was closed on 30 November 1964. Wythenshawe did not then have a public railway service for several decades, with the nearest stations being located in the neighbouring areas of Gatley, Heald Green and Altrincham. A station at Manchester Airport was opened in 1993.

The Airport Line branch of the Manchester Metrolink tram service includes twelve stops throughout Wythenshawe. The line opened on 3 November 2014, a year ahead of schedule. In addition to the building of the new Metrolink lines and stations, a new public transport hub was built in Wythenshawe Town Centre which opened in June 2015 and includes a new bus station and tram stop.

==Economy==
Approximately 43,000 people work in Wythenshawe. There are four areas of industrial activity (estates)—Moss Nook, Ringway (Airport Cargo Centre), Roundthorn and Sharston. It is home to Manchester Airport and Wythenshawe Hospital (part of Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust), which are two of the largest employers in the area. Many national and international companies have premises or main offices in Wythenshawe, including Timpson Ltd, HellermannTyton, Virgin Media, Vodafone and F. Duerr &amp; Sons.

In 1934, George Hamer Scholes built the Wylex Works to produce electrical accessories. The company was later acquired by Electrium, which is now under Siemens&#x27; ownership.

Several greenfield and greyfield sites have been opened up to developers and there are several new housing developments within the area.

The town centre, known as the Civic Centre, was originally built in the 1960s. It expanded over the years and was renovated between 1999 and 2002 to include new stores and other new features, when the city council relinquished ownership and transferred it to St. Modwen Properties. The main shopping area now includes gates that are locked at night to prevent the vandalism that was seen in previous years. The Forum centre, which opened in 1971, houses a library, leisure centre, swimming pool, cafe and other amenities, has also been renovated in a more modern style. For thirty years it also housed the Forum Theatre, but this closed in 2002 and a health clinic and an adult education facility now occupy its space.

In 2007, Asda opened a new superstore on the site of the old Co-operative store (originally built by Woolco in the mid-1970s, which also features a multi-storey car park). A walkway going between the multi-storey car park and the large supermarket building now features a wall mosaic depicting various aspects of the town. After the demolition of two 1960s blocks of multi-storey flats in 2007, new buildings were constructed on the site including a new Wilko shop, office premises and a local authority services hub that provides a new frontage for the town centre from its north-facing aspect.

In June 2022, Manchester City Council announced the purchase of Wythenshawe town centre from St. Modwen Properties as part of wider plans to transform the town centre.

==In the media==
Wythenshawe is the outdoor filming location for the Channel 4 series &quot;Shameless&quot;, which shows various shots of the local tower-blocks, housing estates and other architecture unique to this area. Wythenshawe also housed the outdoor sets for the show, which were built on private property. Production moved from West Gorton (in East Manchester) in early 2007, following disruption to filming caused by local youths.

In 2009, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York (former wife of Prince Andrew) went to Wythenshawe to make a television documentary for ITV1 entitled &quot;The Duchess on the Estate&quot;. In it, she visited the Northern Moor area of Wythenshawe to meet locals and discuss their way of life, and to open a new local community centre. Both before and after its transmission, the documentary was criticised for being a self-serving publicity stunt by Ferguson and she was also criticised for her patronising attitude towards the local people.

==Sport== 
Wythenshawe has two football clubs, Wythenshawe Town F.C. and Wythenshawe F.C., who both were promoted from Level 9 of the football pyramid in 2023-24, and currently play in the Northern Premier League Division One West.

Footballers Paul Stewart, Marcus Rashford and Cole Palmer were born and raised in the area. Former heavyweight boxing world champion Tyson Fury also has links to the area, alongside his trainer Jimmy Egan, who owns a boxing club in the west of the area. Former Manchester City players Lukas and Felix Nmecha also grew up on the estate.

<doc id="1273853" wikidata="Q3521982" url="?curid=1273853" title="The National Interest">
<text>The National Interest (TNI) is an American bimonthly international relations magazine edited by American journalist Jacob Heilbrunn and published by the Center for the National Interest, a public policy think tank based in Washington, D.C., that was established by former U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1994 as the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom. The magazine is associated with the realist school of international studies.

== History ==
Founded in 1985 by American columnist and neoconservatism advocate Irving Kristol, the magazine was until 2001 edited by Australian academic Owen Harries.

In 2001, The National Interest was acquired by The Center for the National Interest, a public policy think tank based in Washington, D.C., that was established by former U.S. President Richard Nixon on January 20, 1994, as the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom.

In 2005, ten editors of &quot;The National Interest&quot; resigned due to different viewpoints regarding the magazine&#x27;s acquisition and with the larger editorial board. Those who left founded a separate journal, &quot;The American Interest&quot;.

In 2013, RealClearWorld named &quot;The National Interest&quot; one of the Best World Opinion Websites. 

In January 2023, it shut down its print edition, which had dropped from 10,000 subscribers in the 1990s to around 2,000 subscribers.

== Influence and reception ==
&quot;The National Interest&quot; is credited with introducing ideas like &quot;the West and the rest&quot; and geoeconomics into public discourse. Political scientist Francis Fukuyama formulated his early political and philosophical thoughts on the end of history in the journal in 1989, where he argued that the worldwide spread of liberal democracies and free-market capitalism of the West and its lifestyle may signal the end point of humanity&#x27;s sociocultural evolution and become the final form of human government. In 2005, Fukuyama left to found &quot;The American Interest&quot;, citing what he saw as excessive international relations realism supported by the Nixon Center.

===Composition===
Therapeutic foods are usually made of a mixture of protein, carbohydrate, lipid and vitamins and minerals. Therapeutic foods are usually produced by grinding all ingredients together and mixing them. The mixing process allows for the protein and carbohydrate components of the food to be embedded in the lipid matrix. The size of the particles in the mixture has to be less than 200 μm for the mixture to maintain its consistency. Using this method, the therapeutic food is produced and packaged without using water, which would eliminate the issue of spoilage. Some therapeutic foods require the addition of water before administering, while others can be consumed as-is. Therapeutic foods are designed and manufactured to ensure that they are ready to eat straight from the packaging. Those foods resist bacterial contamination and require no cooking.

A subset of therapeutic foods, ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), are energy-dense, micronutrient-enriched pastes that have a nutritional profile similar to the traditional F-100 milk-based diet used in inpatient therapeutic feeding programs and are often made of peanuts, oil, sugar and milk powder.

RUTFs are a &quot;homogeneous mixture of lipid-rich and water-soluble foods.&quot; The lipids used in formulating RUTFs are in a viscous liquid form. The other ingredients are in small particles and are mixed through the lipid. The other ingredients are protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. The mixture needs to be homogeneous for it to be effectively consumed. To do this, a specific mixing process is needed. The fat/lipid component of the RUTF is heated and stirred first. The heat should be maintained for the lipid to remain in the optimum form for mixing in the other ingredients. The powdered protein, carbohydrate, and vitamins and minerals are then slowly and gradually added to the lipid, while the lipid is being vigorously stirred. After all the ingredients are added and vigorous stirring is maintained, the mixture is then stirred with more speed and for several minutes. If the powdered ingredients have a particle size that is larger than 200 μm, the mixture starts to separate; the particle size needs to be maintained at less than 200 μm.

The most common RUTFs are made of four ingredients: sugar, dried skimmed milk, oil, and vitamin and mineral supplement (CMV). Other qualities that RUTFs should have included a texture that is soft or crushable and a taste that is acceptable and suitable for young children. RUTFs should be ready to eat without needing to be cooked. A very important characteristic is that the RUTFs have a long shelf-life and that they are micro-organism contamination resistant, without the need for expensive packaging. Since the ingredients need to be suspended in liquid, the liquid used in producing RUTFs needs to be fat/lipid. 50% of the protein forming RUTFs should come from dairy products.

UNICEF specifications for RUTFs say that the vitamin and mineral premix must be sourced from one of the following vendors authorized by the World Food Program: DSM Nutrition/Fortitech, Nicholas Piramal Healthcare Ltd (now Piramal Group), Hexagon Nutrition, BASF (SternVitamin), and the GAIN premix facility.

RUTFs are used by UNICEF Kid Power malnutrition program, which employ celebrities to raise awareness about the issue. 

===Dietary method===
The standard treatment of childhood malnutrition is administered in two phases. Phase one usually deals with children who are severely malnourished and very ill as a result. The therapy used in this phase is F-75, a milk-based liquid food containing modest amounts of energy and protein (75 kcal/100 mL and 0.9 g protein/100 mL) and the administration of parenteral antibiotics. When an improvement in the child&#x27;s appetite and clinical condition is observed, the child is entered into phase two of the treatment. This phase uses F-100. F-100 is a &quot;specially formulated, high-energy, high-protein (100 kcal/100 mL, 2.9 g protein/100 mL) milk-based liquid food&quot;. The child is in phase two until he/she is no longer wasted [weight-for-height z score (WHZ) 2]. Phase two starts while the child is at the hospital but is usually completed after the child goes home. The parent is then responsible for feeding the child a flour supplement made of cereal and legumes as a replacement for the milk-based foods used in phases one and two.

The World Health Organization&#x27;s standards for the treatment of malnutrition in children specify the use of two formulas during initial treatment, F-75 and F-100. These formulas contain a mixture of powdered milk, sugar, and other ingredients designed to provide an easily absorbed mix of carbohydrates and essential micronutrients. They are generally provided as powdered mixes which are reconstituted with water. The WHO recommends the use of these formulas, with the gradual introduction of other foods, until the child approaches a normal weight.

===Effectiveness===
Ready to use therapeutic food within the person&#x27;s own home for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children under five years of age may be effective at improving weight gain and recovery when compared to alternative dietary approaches. The effectiveness of ready to use therapeutic food on potential relapses or on overall mortality is not clear.

As of 2013, Plumpy&#x27;Nut had been used to relieve malnutrition in thousands of African children, gaining approval as a therapeutic food from the World Health Organization.

==Examples==

* K-Mix 2, a high energy food, developed by UNICEF in the 1960s
* Citadel spread, a paste of peanuts, oil, sugar and milk powder in use since 1971
* Plumpy&#x27;nut, a solid RUTF, made in France since 1996 for treatment of severe acute malnutrition
* Medika Mamba, an enriched peanut butter therapeutic food produced and distributed by Meds and Food for Kids in Haiti since 2003
* BP-100, a nutrient-fortified wheat-and-oat bar designed to provide a similar nutritional profile to F-100 by the World Health Organization
* Nutribun, a fortified bread product developed by United States Agency for International Development and distributed under the Food for Peace program

<doc id="1273871" wikidata="Q56611" url="?curid=1273871" title="Carib language">
<text>Carib or Kari&#x27;nja is a Cariban language spoken by the Kalina people (Caribs) of South America. It is spoken by around 7,400 mostly in Brazil, The Guianas, and Venezuela. The language is currently classified as highly endangered.

==Names==
The language is known by several names to both its speakers and outsiders. Traditionally it has been known as &quot;Carib&quot; or &quot;Carib proper&quot; in English, after its speakers, called the &quot;Caribs&quot; in English. It is known &quot;Caribe&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Galina&quot; in French, and &quot;Karaïeb&quot; in Dutch. However, the speakers call themselves &quot;Kalina&quot; or &quot;Karìna&quot; (variously spelled), and call their language &quot;Karìna auran&quot; . Other variants include &quot;Kali&#x27;na&quot;, &quot;Kari&#x27;nja, Cariña&quot;, &quot;Kariña&quot;, &quot;Kalihna&quot;, &quot;Kalinya&quot;; other native names include &quot;Maraworno&quot; and &quot;Marworno&quot;.

== Classification ==
Kari&#x27;nja is classified as a Cariban language, in the Guianan Carib branch.

== Geographic distribution ==
Due to contact with Kari&#x27;nja invaders, some languages have Kari&#x27;nja words incorporated into them, despite being Arawakan languages linguistically.
A Carib-based &quot;lengua generale&quot; was once used in the old missions of the Oyapock and surrounding regions, apparently surviving at least along the Uaçá tributary into the 20th century.

In Suriname, there is a village called Konomerume which is located near the Wajambo River. With about 349 people living there, a majority identify as ethnically Kari&#x27;nja and as for who knows the language, the adults are reported to at least have a decent knowledge of it. Those above the age of 65 use the language as a primary language among the members of the community. Speakers between the ages of 45 and 65 tend to use the language only when speaking with older residents or elder members of their family, while for the most part using the official languages: Dutch and Sranan Tongo. Younger adults between the ages of 20 and 40 for the most part understand the language but do not speak it, and children learn bits about Kari&#x27;nja in school.

==Dialects==
Carib dialects (with number of speakers indicated in parentheses):
*Venezuelan Carib (1000)
*Guyanese Carib (2000)
*Western Surinamese Carib (500)
*Eastern Surinamese and French Guianese Carib (3000)
**Suriname has two dialects of Kari&#x27;nja: &quot;Aretyry&quot; which is spoken in the west and central parts of the country, and &quot;Tyrewuju&quot; which is what the majority of Kari&#x27;nja speakers in Suriname use.

==Phonology==
In the Kari&#x27;nja language, there are four syllable patterns: V, CV, VC, CVC; C standing for consonants while V means a vowel. Regarding phonemes, consonants are divided into two groups: obstruents (voiceless stops—p, t, k) and resonants (voiced stops—b, d, g, s).

Kari&#x27;nja has a typical 6 vowel system after *ô merged with *o, being &quot;a e i o u ï.&quot; Compared to past Kari&#x27;nja, the modern day Kari&#x27;nja has replaced the &quot;e&quot; in many words to &quot;o&quot;.


Allophones for /r w t/ include sounds as [ɽ β,v tʃ]. /s/ before /i/ may be pronounced as [ʃ]. /n/ before a consonant may be pronounced as [ŋ] and also [ɲ] elsewhere. Another sound, ranging [h~x], often occurs before a voiced or voiceless consonant, and succeeding a vowel, it can also be an allophone of /ʔ/.

== Alphabet ==
The Carib alphabet consists of 15 letters:

a, e, i, j, k, `, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, w, y.

== Grammar ==
There are 17 particles within Kari&#x27;nja which include the &quot;ky-&quot; prefix and the &quot;-ng&quot; suffix.
== Vocabulary ==
All four dialects of Kari&#x27;nja have loan words from the primary language of the area (Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana). For example, the Kari&#x27;nja spoken in Suriname borrows words from Dutch and Sranantongo.

=== Examples ===
Some of the words show instances in which the &quot;e&quot; has been replaced with &quot;o&quot; in present-day Kari&#x27;nja. The two statements beneath the singular words show examples of two suffixes.

<doc id="1273872" wikidata="Q3847848" url="?curid=1273872" title="Zygmunt Szendzielarz">
<text>Zygmunt Szendzielarz (12 March 1910 – 8 February 1951, nom de guerre &quot;Łupaszka&quot;.) was the commander of the Polish 5th Wilno Brigade of the Home Army (Armia Krajowa) and after the Second World War fought against the Red Army. The unit also committed the Dubingiai massacre, murdering hundreds of Lithuanian civilians on 23 June 1944.

Following the postwar Soviet takeover of Poland he was arrested, accused of numerous crimes, and executed in Warsaw&#x27;s Mokotów Prison as an anti-communist diehard soldier. 

In 1993, after the fall of communism, he was rehabilitated and declared innocent of all charges. In 2007 Polish president Lech Kaczyński posthumously awarded him the order of Polonia Restituta. 
==Early life==
Szendzielarz was born in Stryj (Austrian Partition, now Lviv Oblast, Ukraine), then part of Austria-Hungary and from 1919 to 1939 in Poland, into the family of a railway worker. After graduating from primary school in Lwów, he attended a biological-mathematical gymnasium in Lwów and then Stryj. After graduating, he volunteered for the Polish Army and completed Infantry Non-commissioned officer School in Ostrów Mazowiecka (1932), then Cavalry NCO School in Grudziądz. He was promoted to lieutenant and transferred to Vilnius, where he assumed command of a squadron in the 4th Niemen Uhlan Regiment.

== World War II ==

=== Invasion of Poland (1939) ===
With his unit, he took part in the 1939 September Campaign. His unit was attached to the Wilno Cavalry Brigade under General Władysław Anders, part of the Prussian Army. After retreating from northern Poland, Gen. Anders&#x27; forces fought their way towards the city of Lwów and the Romanian Bridgehead. However, in the area of Lublin Szendzielarz&#x27;s unit was surrounded and suffered heavy losses. Soon afterwards Szendzielarz was taken prisoner of war by the Soviets, but he managed to escape to Lwów, where he lived for a short period under a false name. He tried to cross the Hungarian border to escape from Poland and reach the Polish Army in France, but failed and finally moved with his family to Vilnius.

=== Home Army in the Vilnius Region (1943–1944) ===
In Vilnius, Szendzielarz started working on various posts under false names. In mid-1943 he joined the Home Army under the nom de guerre &quot;Łupaszka&quot;, after Jerzy Dąbrowski, and in August he started organizing his own partisan group in the forests surrounding the city. Soon the unit was joined by local volunteers and the remnants of Antoni Burzyński&#x27;s unit, destroyed by Soviet partisans. By September, the unit was 700 men strong and was officially named the 5th Vilnian Home Army Brigade (&quot;5 Wileńska Brygada Armii Krajowej&quot;).

&quot;Łupaszko&#x27;s&quot; unit fought against the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; units in the Vilnius Region, but it was also frequently attacked by the paradropped Soviet partisans. In April 1944, Zygmunt Szendzielarz was arrested by the Lithuanian police and handed over to the Gestapo. Łupaszko was free in the same month under circumstances that remain unclear. In reprisal actions, his brigade captured several dozen German officials and sent several threatening letters to Gestapo but it remains unknown if and how these contributed to his release.

==== Dubingiai massacre (20 June 1944) ====
On 20 June 1944, the 3rd Company of the 258th Lithuanian Police Battalion murdered 39 Poles in Glinciszki, including women and children. Lithuanian collaborator units also harassed the Polish population in Pawłów, Adamowszczyzna, and Sieńkowszczyzna. In reprisal, on 23 June 1944, a unit of 5th Vilnian Home Army Brigade attacked the fortified village of Dubingiai, capturing a bunker defended by Lithuanian policemen. The order to attack the village was given by Szendzielarz. Dubingiai became the target of the attack due to many of the policemen, and their families, responsible for the Glinciszki crime living there. Having the list of people who collaborated with the occupier, the Poles began action to avenge the death of the residents of Glinciszki. According to historian Paweł Rokicki, the actions in Dubingiai were a war crime, and the deaths of the civilians were intentional. In Dubingiai between 21 and 27 inhabitants of the village died, including women and children.

==== Operation Ostra Brama (7–13 July 1944) ====
In August, the commander of all Home Army units in the Vilnius Region, Gen. Aleksander &quot;Wilk&quot; Krzyżanowski, ordered all six brigades under his command to prepare for Operation Tempest — a planned all-national rising against the German forces occupying Poland. In what became known as Operation Ostra Brama, the 5th Brigade was to attack the Vilnius suburb of Žvėrynas in cooperation with advancing units of the 3rd Belorussian Front. However, Łupaszko, for fear of being arrested with his units by the NKVD and killed on the spot, disobeyed orders and moved his unit to central Poland. Vilnius was occupied by Soviet troops with Polish aid. The Polish commander was then arrested by the Soviets and the majority of his men were sent to Gulags and sites of detention in the Soviet Union.

It is uncertain why Szendzielarz was not court-martialed for desertion. Most likely it was in fact General &quot;Wilk&quot; himself who ordered Łupaszko&#x27;s unit away from the Wilno area, due to Łupaszko long having been involved in fighting with Soviet partisans and Wilk not wanting to provoke the Red Army. Łupaszko&#x27;s unit remained in the forests and he decided to await the outcome of Russo-Polish talks held by the Polish government-in-exile. Meanwhile, the unit was reorganized and captured enough equipment to fully arm 600 men with machine guns and machine pistols.

== After World War II ==

After the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States broke the pacts with Poland and accepted the communist &quot;Polish Committee of National Liberation&quot; as the provisional government of Poland, Łupaszka restarted hostilities—this time against the new oppressor, in the ranks of Freedom and Independence Association. However, after several successful actions against the NKVD units in the area of Białowieża Forest, it became apparent that such actions would result in the total destruction of his unit.

In February 1945 his wife died and the nurse Lidia Lwow-Eberle became his partner.

In September 1945, Zygmunt Szendzielarz moved with a large part of his unit to Gdańsk-Oliwa, where he remained underground while preparing his unit for a new partisan offensive against the Soviet-backed communist authorities of Poland. On 14 April 1946 Szendzielarz finally mobilized his unit and headed for the Tuchola Forest, where he started operations against the forces of the Internal Security Corps, Security Office and the communist authorities. Łupaszko was hoping that in the spring of 1946 the former Western Allies of Poland would start a new war against the Soviet Union and that the Polish underground units could prove useful in liberating Poland. However, when he realized that no such war was planned he decided to disband his unit. He saw the further fight as a waste of blood of his men and decided to retire from the open fight against the communists.

After several years underground, he was arrested by the Security Office on 28 June 1948, in Osielec near Nowy Targ. After more than two years of brutal interrogation and torture in Warsaw&#x27;s Mokotów Prison he was sentenced to death on 2 November 1950 by the Soviet-controlled court-martial in Warsaw. He was executed on 8 February 1951, together with several other Home Army soldiers. Szendzielarz was 40 years old. His body was buried in an undisclosed location. During a 2013 exhumation Szendzielarz&#x27;s remains were recovered and identified as one of roughly 250 bodies buried in a mass grave at the Meadow at Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Military Cemetery.

Szendzielarz&#x27;s unit massacred Lithuanian civilians in 1944. The victims of the 5th AK Brigade were primarily women and children (about 75% of all those killed). They were shot as a result of the deliberate action. During the Dubingiai massacre, there was no fight, in particular with the Lithuanian police, which simply was not there. Findings from the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) leave no doubt that the retaliatory action of the 5th Home Army Brigade was a war crime on civilians.

On 17 April 1945, Zygmunt Sendzielarz&#x27;s unit once more massacred Belarusian civilians in the village of Narewka, Poland.

<doc id="1273886" wikidata="Q62118" url="?curid=1273886" title="Robert Hermann Schomburgk">
<text>Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk (5 June 1804 – 11 March 1865) was a Holy Roman Empire-born explorer for Great Britain who carried out geographical, ethnological and botanical studies in South America and the West Indies, and also fulfilled diplomatic missions for the United Kingdom in the Dominican Republic and Thailand.

==Life and career==
Schomburgk was born at Freyburg, Prussian Saxony, a son of Johann Friedrich Ludwig Schomburgk, a Protestant minister. In 1820, whilst staying with his uncle, he learnt botany from a professor.

===Commercial career===
He entered commercial life and, in 1828, went to the United States, where he worked for a time as a clerk in Boston and Philadelphia.
In 1828, he was requested to supervise a transport of Saxon sheep to the American state of Virginia, where he lived for a time. In the same year, he became a partner in a tobacco factory at Richmond. The factory was burned down, and Schomburgk was ruined. He suffered further setbacks on the Caribbean island of St. Thomas, where he lost all his belongings in a fire. Consequently, he ceased his business activities.
===Geographic and exploration career===
In 1830, he left for Anegada, one of the Virgin Isles, notorious for its shipwrecks. Although he did not possess the special knowledge that is required for such work, he surveyed the island at his own expense and sent to the Royal Geographical Society (London) a report which created such an impression that, in 1835, he was entrusted by that body with conducting an expedition of exploration of British Guiana.

He fulfilled his mission (1835–1839) with great success, incidentally discovering the giant Victoria Regia water lily in 1837 and many new species of orchids, one genus of which, &quot;Schomburgkia&quot;, was named for him. He also laid to rest the persistent myth of Raleigh&#x27;s Lake Parime by proposing that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah had been misidentified as a lake. In 1841, he returned to Guiana, this time as a British Government official to survey the colony and fix its eastern and western boundaries. The result was the provisional boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela, known as the &quot;Schomburgk Line&quot;, and the boundary with the Dutch colony of Surinam.
He also made further geographical and ethnological observations and was joined there by his brother, Moritz Richard. He repeatedly urged fixing the boundary with Brazil, motivated by his encounters with Brazilian enslavement of local Indian tribes, most of which no longer exist. Schomburgk&#x27;s survey later played a role in the arbitration of the southern boundary between British Guiana and Brazil, with arbitration by the King of Italy in 1904.

On the brothers&#x27; return to London in June 1844, Schomburgk presented a report of his journey to the Geographical Society, for which he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1845, and continued in other official capacities. In 1846, he was stationed in Barbados, where he gathered information to compile a geographical and statistical description of the island, later to be published as the &quot;History of Barbados&quot; published in 1848 by Cass as a library series of West Indian studies.

===Diplomatic career===
In 1848, he was appointed British consul to the Dominican Republic. In 1850, he signed an advantageous commercial treaty for Great Britain and also secured a truce from Soulouque on behalf of the Dominican government. During the following years, he contributed valuable papers about the physical geography of the island to the journal of the Royal Geographical Society. For example, he became the first recorded person in history to climb Hispaniola&#x27;s (and the entire Caribbean&#x27;s) highest mountain, Pico Duarte, in 1851, naming it &quot;Monte Tina&quot; and almost measuring its height correctly at . In 1857, he was promoted to the position of British Consul-General of Siam, where Britain exercised extraterritorial jurisdiction through consular courts over British subjects. In a letter to his cousin William, Schomburgk notes, &quot;In order to get an insight into the English summary police court proceedings, I was, before I left London, obliged to attend police courts there for some time, also to acquaint myself with these proceedings by the study of books. Based in Bangkok, he also continued his geographical surveys. The letter gives a short account of his visit to the semi-independent kingdom of Chiang Mai in 1859–60, and thence by elephant across the mountain range to Moulmein on the Bay of Bengal, returning to Bangkok after a trip of 135 days and approximately 1000 English miles.

===Death===
He retired from the public service in 1864, hampered by health problems, and died in Schöneberg in Berlin on 11 March 1865.

=== Recognition ===

Schomburgk was a member of various European, American, and Asiatic learned societies, and was a knight of the Legion of Honour and of the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle.

Schomburgk&#x27;s deer (&quot;Rucervus schomburgki&quot;) was named after him.

The South American fishes &quot;Mylesinus schomburgkii&quot; , &quot;Polycentrus schomburgkii&quot; and &quot;Myloplus schomburgkii&quot; are named after him.

Many special of Neotropical plants are named for him:
*&quot;Harperocallis schomburgkiana&quot; 

His botanical collection is at Kew and his ethnographical collection from Guyana is at the British Museum.

<text>The Swedish Football Association&lt;ref name=&quot;svenskfotboll.se/in-english/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (, SvFF) is the governing and body of football in Sweden. It organises the football leagues – Allsvenskan for men and for women – and the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams. It is based in Solna and is a founding member of both FIFA and UEFA. SvFF is supported by 24 district organisations.

== Background ==

Svenska Fotbollförbundet (SvFF) (English: Swedish Football Association) was founded in Stockholm on 18 December 1904 and is the sports federation responsible for the promotion and administration of organised football in Sweden and also represents the country outside Sweden. SvFF is affiliated to the Swedish Sports Confederation (RF) and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).

In 2009 there were 3,359 clubs affiliated to the Swedish Football Association with a total of more than a million members, of whom about 500,000 were active players. Together, they accounted for almost one third of the total Swedish sports movement activities.

SvFF administers the Swedish men&#x27;s respectively women&#x27;s national football teams, other football teams and leagues including the Allsvenskan and Superettan. The motto of Swedish football – &quot;one club in every village, football for all&quot; – is reflected in the democratic constitution of Swedish football. All football competition in the nation is arranged by the SvFF and its 24 district organisations. The clubs are voting members at the annual meetings of the district organisations. The district organisations and the elite clubs are entitled to vote at the F.A.&#x27;s general meeting.

SvFF was the sole owner of Sweden&#x27;s national stadium, the Råsunda Stadium in Solna, from 1999 until it was replaced in 2012 by Friends Arena, located about 1 kilometer away and also in Solna. SvFF is the lead partner in the consortium that owns the current stadium, and maintains its offices there (as it did at the prior stadium).

The Swedish Football Association Football Gala is held annually in November since 2005. It includes the award for the best male player (Guldbollen) and female players (Diamantbollen).

SvFF had a turnover 2008 of 554 MSEK.

Karl-Erik Nilsson was the President between March 2012 and March 2023. He was replaced by Fredrik Reinfeldt, former Prime Minister of Sweden.

== Early history ==

The first Swedish national football championship was played in 1896 but it was 7 years later in 1903 that the Riksidrottsförbundet was formed which was to be the precursor to the Svenska Fotbollförbundet. The new organisation had a football and hockey section (hockey being the term for bandy at that time and not ice hockey or field hockey). In 1904 Sweden was one of 7 nations that founded FIFA. It also introduced ice hockey to Sweden in 1920, before the 1922 establishment of the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. Before the 1925 establishment of the Swedish Bandy Association, the Swedish Football Association also administered organized bandy in Sweden.

In 1906, the name Svenska Fotbollförbundet (Swedish Football Association) was officially accepted and the following year SvFF was officially voted into FIFA. On 12 July 1908, Sweden&#x27;s first international match was played in which Norway were defeated 11–3 in Gothenburg. However the Olympics were a disappointment for Sweden, losing 1–12 to England and 0–2 to the Netherlands.

== District Football Associations ==
Swedish football is built on a single pyramid league system. While the SvFF administers the top leagues, the 24 district or regional associations administers youth football and the lower-tier leagues from Division 4 (men) and Division 3 (women), respectively, and further below.

The 24 district organisations are as follows:
*Blekinge Fotbollförbund
*Bohusläns Fotbollförbund
*Dalarnas Fotbollförbund
*Dalslands Fotbollförbund
*Gestriklands Fotbollförbund
*Göteborgs Fotbollförbund
*Gotlands Fotbollförbund
*Hallands Fotbollförbund
*Hälsinglands Fotbollförbund
*Jämtland-Härjedalens Fotbollförbund

<doc id="1273889" wikidata="Q3833976" url="?curid=1273889" title="List of F5, EF5, and IF5 tornadoes">
<text>This is a list of tornadoes which have been officially or unofficially labeled as F5, EF5, IF5, T10-T11, the highest possible ratings on the various tornado intensity scales. These scales – the Fujita scale, the Enhanced Fujita scale, the International Fujita scale, and the TORRO tornado intensity scale – attempt to estimate the intensity of a tornado by classifying the damage caused to natural features and man-made structures in the tornado&#x27;s path.

==Background==
Each year, more than 2,000 tornadoes are recorded worldwide, with the vast majority occurring in North America and Europe. In order to assess the intensity of these events, meteorologist Ted Fujita devised a method to estimate maximum wind speeds within tornadic storms based on the damage caused; this became known as the Fujita scale. The scale ranks tornadoes from F0 to F5, with F0 being the least intense and F5 being the most intense. F5 tornadoes were estimated to have had maximum winds between and .
Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999, engineers questioned the reliability of the Fujita scale. Ultimately, a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the Enhanced Fujita scale. The Enhanced Fujita scale is used predominantly in North America. Most of Europe, on the other hand, uses the TORRO tornado intensity scale (or T-Scale), which ranks tornado intensity between T0 and T11; F5/EF5 tornadoes are approximately equivalent to T10 to T11 on the T-Scale.

In the United States, between 1950 and January 31, 2007, a total of 50 tornadoes were officially rated F5, and since February 1, 2007, a total of nine tornadoes have been officially rated EF5. Since 1950, Canada has had one tornado officially rated an F5. Outside the United States and Canada, seven tornadoes have been officially rated F5/EF5/IF5: two each in France and Germany, and one each in Italy, Argentina and Australia.

Several other tornadoes have also been documented as possibly attaining this status, though they are not officially rated as such. The work of tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis revealed the existence of several dozen likely F5 tornadoes between 1880 and 1995. Grazulis also called into question the ratings of several tornadoes currently rated F5 by official sources. Many tornadoes officially rated F4/EF4 or equivalent have been disputed and described as actual F5/EF5/T10+ or equivalent tornadoes, and vice versa; since structures are completely destroyed in both cases, distinguishing between an EF4 tornado and an EF5 tornado is often very difficult. Additionally, because tornado ratings are damage-based, many tornadoes capable of causing F5/EF5/T10+ damage, such as those that move through rural areas, may receive lower ratings because their strongest winds do not strike any suitable damage indicators.

===Research in the 2020s===
In July 2023, the International Fujita scale (IF-scale) was officially published, creating a new scale which improved on issues from the Fujita and Enhanced Fujita scales.

In March 2024, Anthony W. Lyza, Matthew D. Flournoy, and A. Addison Alford, researchers with the National Severe Storms Laboratory, Storm Prediction Center, CIWRO, and the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s School of Meteorology, published a paper stating, &quot;&gt;20% of supercell tornadoes may be capable of producing EF4–EF5 damage&quot;.

In May 2024, researchers with the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s Northern Tornado Project and engineering department conducted a case study on the 2018 Alonsa EF4 tornado, the 2020 Scarth EF3 tornado, and the 2023 Didsbury EF4 tornado. In their case study, the researchers assessed extreme damage caused by the tornado which is ineligible for ratings on the Canadian Enhanced Fujita scale or the American Enhanced Fujita scale (EF-scale). In their analysis, it was determined all three tornadoes caused damage well-beyond their assigned EF-scale ratings, with all three tornadoes having EF5-intensity winds. At the end of the analysis, the researchers stated, &quot;the lofting wind speeds given by this model are much higher than the rating based on the ground survey EF-scale assessment. This may be due to the current tendency to bias strong EF5 tornadoes lower than reality, or limitations in conventional EF-scale assessments&quot;.

==List of events==

The tornadoes on this list have been formally rated F5 by an official government source. Unless otherwise noted, the source of the F5 rating is the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS), as shown in the archives of the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).

Prior to 1950, assessments of F5 tornadoes are based primarily on the work of Thomas P. Grazulis. The NCDC has accepted 38 of his F5 classifications of tornadoes occurring between 1880 and 1950. In addition to the accepted ones, Grazulis rated a further 25 during the same period which were not accepted. Grazulis&#x27; work has identified 16 additional F5 tornadoes between 1950 and 1995, with four later being accepted by the NCDC. From 1950 to 1970, tornadoes were assessed retrospectively, primarily using information recorded in government databases, as well as newspaper photographs and eyewitness accounts. Beginning in 1971, tornadoes were rated by the NWS using on-site damage surveys.

As of February 1, 2007, tornadoes in the United States are rated using the Enhanced Fujita scale, which replaced the Fujita scale in order to more accurately correlate tornadic intensity with damage indicators and to augment and refine damage descriptors. No earlier tornadoes will be reclassified on the Enhanced Fujita scale, and no new tornadoes in the United States will be rated on the original Fujita scale. France and Canada also adopted the EF-Scale in subsequent years. Since the creation of the International Fujita scale in 2018, two tornadoes have been rated IF5.

===Official F5/EF5/IF5 tornadoes===
Worldwide, a total of 67 tornadoes have been officially rated F5/EF5/IF5: 59 in the United States, two each in France and Germany, and one each in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Italy. Of the 59 tornadoes in the United States, 50 are officially rated F5 on the original Fujita scale (with dates of occurrence between May 11, 1953, and May 3, 1999), and nine are officially rated EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale (with dates of occurrence between May 4, 2007, and May 20, 2013).

In total worldwide, 55 of these tornadoes have been rated F5, ten have been rated EF5, and two have been rated IF5.

====F5 tornadoes====
Worldwide, 55 tornadoes have the rating of F5 on the Fujita scale.
====EF5 tornadoes====
Worldwide, ten tornadoes have the rating of EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale.
====IF5 tornadoes====
Worldwide, two tornadoes have the rating of IF5 on the International Fujita scale.
===Possible F5/EF5/IF5 tornadoes===
Because the distinctions between F4/EF4/T9 and F5/EF5/T10 tornadoes are often ambiguous, the official ratings of numerous other tornadoes formally rated below F5/EF5/T10 or equivalent have been disputed, with certain government sources or independent studies contradicting the official record.

====Previously rated F5/EF5/IF5 or rated F5/EF5/IF5 by others====

This list includes tornadoes previously rated F5 or EF5 by the National Weather Service as well as tornadoes rated F5/EF5 by other branches of the United States government, tornado experts (i.e. Thomas P. Grazulis, Ted Fujita), or meteorological research institutions (i.e. European Severe Storms Laboratory).


====Possible F5/EF5/IF5 damage====

This list includes tornadoes with possible F5 or EF5 damage indicated by the National Weather Service as well as tornadoes with possible F5/EF5 damage by other branches of the United States government, tornado experts (i.e. Thomas P. Grazulis, Ted Fujita), or meteorological research institutions (i.e. European Severe Storms Laboratory).


====Possible F5/EF5/IF5 intensity====

This list includes tornadoes believed or confirmed to have been at F5 or EF5 intensity. These indications can come from the United States government, Doppler on Wheels, tornado experts (i.e. Thomas P. Grazulis, Ted Fujita), or meteorological research institutions (i.e. European Severe Storms Laboratory).


====Possible F5/EF5/IF5 tornadoes with no official rating====

Many other tornadoes have never been formally rated by an official government source but have nonetheless been described as F5/EF5/T10+ or equivalent, often by independent studies. Most of these tornadoes occurred prior to 1950, before tornadoes were rated according to standardized damage assessments, and their unofficial classifications as F5/EF5/T10+ or equivalent have been made in retrospect, largely on the basis of photographic analysis and eyewitness accounts. A few, such as the Tri-State Tornado of 1925, are widely accepted as F5/EF5/T10+ tornadoes, despite not being rated as such in official records.

&quot;This is a and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by about tornadoes for this list.&quot;

<text>Peter Warren Rodman (November 24, 1943 – August 2, 2008) was an American attorney, government official, author, and national security adviser.

== Early life and education ==

Born in Boston, he was educated at The Roxbury Latin School. He earned an A.B from Harvard College, a B.A. and M.A. from Worcester College, Oxford, and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School.

== Career ==
Rodman began his career in government as a staff member on the National Security Council, working from 1969 to 1977 and serving as an assistant to Henry Kissinger. From 1977 to 1983, he was a Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. From 1984 to 1986, Rodman served as Director of Policy Planning under Ronald Reagan. He served as Reagan&#x27;s Deputy National Security Advisor from 1986 to 1987. From 1987 to 1990, he served as Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and National Security Council Counselor.

He was one of the signers of the January 26, 1998 Project for the New American Century sent to the U.S. President Bill Clinton. He worked extensively with Henry Kissinger, helping him write his memoirs. He was a member of the board of trustees of Freedom House, Vice President and member of the board of directors of the World Affairs Council and a Fellow of the Foreign Policy Institute of SAIS.

From 1991 to 1999, Rodman was a senior editor at &quot;National Review,&quot; a conservative magazine. He also served as the Director of National Security Programs at the Center for the National Interest, a conservative think-tank founded by Richard Nixon.

Rodman returned to government service as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs in the George W. Bush administration.

In March 2007, he left his position as United States Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs to become a Senior Fellow at Brookings Institution. He was the author of &quot;More Precious Than Peace&quot;, a book on the Cold War in the Third World in which he praises the Reagan administration for warding off communism in Afghanistan, Angola, and Cambodia.

== Personal life ==
Rodman and his wife, Veronique, had two children. Veronique was named a member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors by George W. Bush, serving from 2003 to 2004. Rodman died in Baltimore, Maryland, on August 2, 2008, from leukemia. He was 64.

<doc id="1273897" wikidata="Q338621" url="?curid=1273897" title="Beneventan script">
<text>The Beneventan script was a medieval script that originated in the Duchy of Benevento in southern Italy. In the past it has also been called &quot;Langobarda&quot;, &quot;Longobarda&quot;, &quot;Longobardisca&quot; (signifying its origins in the territories ruled by the Lombards), or sometimes &quot;Gothica&quot;; it was first called &quot;Beneventan&quot; by palaeographer E. A. Lowe.

It is mostly associated with Italy south of Rome, but it was also used in Beneventan-influenced centres across the Adriatic Sea in Dalmatia. The script was used from approximately the mid-8th century until the 13th century, although there are examples from as late as the 16th century. There were two major centres of Beneventan usage: the monastery on Monte Cassino, and Bari. The Bari type developed in the 10th century from the Monte Cassino type; both were based on Roman cursive as written by the Langobards. In general the script is very angular. According to Lowe, the perfected form of the script was used in the 11th century, while Desiderius was abbot of Monte Cassino, declining thereafter.

==Features==
Beneventan features many ligatures and &quot;connecting strokes&quot; – the letters of a word could be joined together by a single line, with forms almost unrecognizable to a modern eye.
Ligatures may be obligatory as: , , , and (two different forms: &quot;ti-dura&quot; where t had kept the t sound and &quot;ti-assibilata&quot; where t had taken the vulgar ts sound). They may be optional: frequent as , and ; or rare as , and .
Ligatures involving the letter resemble late New Latin Cursive as in the Merovingian and Visigothic, exception made for peculiar ligature where is connected to on top influencing later on the German pre-caroline script and all the script from this derived until nowadays. In ligatures can take many forms depending on the letter joined to it. Ligatures with the letters and are also common. In early forms of Beneventan, the letter has an open top, similar to the letter ; later, it resembled &quot;cc&quot; or &quot;oc&quot;, with long tails hanging to the right. In the Bari type, the letter often has a &quot;broken&quot; form, resembling the Beneventan form of the letter . However, itself has a very long middle arm, distinguishing it from . The letter can have a vertical or left-slanting ascender, the letter resembles the uncial form, and the letter is very tall and resembles .

The script has a unique way to signify abbreviations both by omission and contraction – like most other Latin scripts, missing letters can be signified by a macron over the previous letter, although Beneventan often adds a dot to the macron. There is also a symbol resembling the digit , or a sideways , when the letter has been omitted. In other scripts there is often little or no punctuation, but standard punctuation forms were developed for the Beneventan script, including the basis for the modern question mark.

Beneventan shares some features with Visigothic and Merovingian script, probably due to the common late Roman matrix.

<doc id="1273900" wikidata="Q17110363" url="?curid=1273900" title="A Guide for the Perplexed">
<text>A Guide for the Perplexed is a short book by E. F. Schumacher, published in 1977. The title is a reference to Maimonides&#x27;s &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;. Schumacher himself considered &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot; to be his most important achievement, although he was better known for his 1973 environmental economics bestseller &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;, which made him a leading figure within the ecology movement. His daughter wrote that her father handed her the book on his deathbed, five days before he died and he told her &quot;this is what my life has been leading to&quot;. As the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot; is really a statement of the philosophical underpinnings that inform &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;&quot;.

Schumacher describes his book as being concerned with how humans live in the world. It is also a treatise on the nature and organisation of knowledge and is something of an attack on what Schumacher calls &quot;materialistic scientism&quot;. Schumacher argues that the current philosophical &quot;maps&quot; that dominate western thought and science are both overly narrow and based on some false premises. However, this book is only in small part a critique.

== Four Great Truths==
Schumacher put forward what he considers to be the &quot;four great truths&quot; of philosophy:
* The world is a hierarchical structure with at least four &quot;levels of being&quot;.
* The &quot;Principle of Adequateness&quot; determines human ability to accurately perceive the world.
* Human learning relates to four &quot;fields of knowledge&quot;.
* The art of living requires an understanding of two types of problem: &quot;convergent&quot; and &quot;divergent&quot;.

==Critique of materialistic scientism==

Schumacher was very much in favor of the scientific spirit, but felt that the dominant methodology within science, which he called materialistic scientism, was flawed and stood in the way of achieving knowledge in any other arena than inanimate nature. Schumacher believed that this flaw originated in the writings of Descartes and Francis Bacon, when modern science was first established.

He makes a distinction between the descriptive and instructional sciences. According to Schumacher the descriptive sciences are primarily concerned with what can be seen or otherwise experienced, e.g. botany and sociology, while the instructional sciences are concerned with how certain systems work and can be manipulated to produce certain results, e.g. biology and chemistry. Instructional science is primarily based on evidence gained from experimentation.

Materialistic scientism is based on the methodology of the latter, which developed to study and experiment with inanimate matter. According to Schumacher many philosophers of science fail to recognize the difference between descriptive and instructional science, or ascribe this difference to stages in the evolution of a specific science, which for these philosophers means that the instructional sciences are seen as being the most advanced variety of science.

He is particularly offended by the view that instructional science is the most advanced form of science, because for Schumacher, it is the study of the low hanging fruit of inanimate matter, or less metaphorically the study of the lowest and least complex level of being. As Schumacher sees it, knowledge gained about the higher levels of being, while far harder to get and far less certain, is all the more valuable.

He argues that applying the standards and procedures of instructional science to descriptive sciences is erroneous, because in the descriptive fields it is simply not possible to use the experimental techniques of instructional sciences. Experimentation is an appropriate method when dealing with inanimate matter, but applying it to the living world is liable to destroy or damage living things and systems, and is therefore inappropriate.

He uses the term scientism because he argues that many people, including some philosophers of science, have misunderstood the theory behind instructional science and instead believe that it produces truth. But the instructional sciences are based on induction; and as David Hume famously points out induction is not the same as truth. Furthermore, according to Schumacher, instructional sciences are primarily concerned only with the parts of truth that are useful for manipulation, i.e. they focus on those instructions which are necessary to reliably produce certain results. For Schumacher, instructional sciences therefore produce theories which are useful: pragmatic truths. By contrast, Schumacher argues that the descriptive sciences are interested in the truth in the wider sense of the word.

He argues that materialistic scientism follows a policy of leaving something out if it is in doubt. Consequently, the maps of western science fail to show large &#x27;unorthodox&#x27; parts of both theory and practice of science and social science, and reveal a complete disregard for art and many other high level humanistic qualities. Such an approach, Schumacher argues, provides a grey, limited, utilitarian worldview without room for vitally important phenomena like beauty and meaning.

He observes that the mere mention of spirituality and spiritual phenomena in academic discussion is seen among scientists as a sign of &#x27;mental deficiency&#x27; . Schumacher argues that where there is near total agreement a subject becomes effectively dead; it is therefore the subjects where there is doubt that deserve the most intense research. Schumacher believes in contrast to materialistic science that what is in doubt should be shown prominently, not hidden away or ignored.

His biggest complaint against materialistic scientism is that it rejects the validity of certain questions, which for Schumacher are actually the most important questions of all. Materialistic scientism rejects the idea of levels of being, but for Schumacher this leads to a one-sided view of nature. For Schumacher, you can learn much about humanity by studying from the perspective of minerals, plants and animals, because humans contain the lower levels of being. But that is not the full or even the most important part of the story, as he puts &quot;...everything can be learned about him except that which makes us human.&quot;

===Evolutionism===
Schumacher first states that the evolutionist doctrine clearly sits in the descriptive sciences rather than instructive sciences. Schumacher accepts that evolution as a generalization within the descriptive science of biological change has been established beyond any doubt whatsoever. However, he considers the &quot;evolutionist doctrine&quot; to be a very different matter. The evolutionist doctrine purports to prove and explain biological change in the same manner as the proof and explanation offered by the instructional sciences. Schumacher quotes the 1975 Encyclopædia Britannica as an example of this view: &quot;Darwin did two things: he showed that evolution was in fact contradicting scriptural legends of creation and that its cause, natural selection, was automatic leaving no room for divine guidance or design.&quot;

He considers the evolutionist doctrine to be a major philosophical and scientific error. Schumacher argues that the evolutionist doctrine starts with the perfectly reasonable explanation of change in living beings, and then jumps to using it as an explanation for the development of consciousness, self-awareness, language, social institutions and the origin of life itself. Schumacher points out that making this conceptual leap simply does not meet the standards of scientific rigor and the uncritical acceptance of this leap is, for Schumacher, completely unscientific.

==Levels of being==
For Schumacher one of science&#x27;s major mistakes has been rejecting the traditional philosophical and religious view that the universe is a hierarchy of being. Schumacher makes a restatement of the traditional chain of being.

He agrees with the view that there are four kingdoms: Mineral, Plant, Animal, Human. He argues that there are important differences of kind between each level of being. Between mineral and plant is the phenomenon of life. Schumacher says that although scientists say we should not use the phrase &#x27;life energy&#x27;, the difference between inorganic and organic matter still exists and has not been explained by science to the extent of rendering said phrase fully invalid. Schumacher points out that though we can recognize life and destroy it, we can&#x27;t create it. Schumacher notes that the &#x27;life sciences&#x27; are &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; because they hardly ever deal with life as such, and instead content themselves with analyzing the &quot;physico-chemical body which is life&#x27;s carrier.&quot; Schumacher goes on to say there is nothing in physics or chemistry to explain the phenomenon of life.

For Schumacher, a similar jump in level of being takes place between plant and animal, which is differentiated by the phenomenon of consciousness. We can recognize consciousness, not least because we can knock an animal unconscious, but also because animals exhibit at minimum primitive thought and intelligence.

The next level, according to Schumacher, is between Animal and Human, which are differentiated by the phenomenon of self-consciousness or self awareness. Self-consciousness is the reflective awareness of one&#x27;s consciousness and thoughts.

Schumacher realizes that the terms—life, consciousness and self-consciousness—are subject to misinterpretation so he suggests that the differences can best be expressed as an equation which can be written thus:
* &quot;Mineral&quot; = m
* &quot;Plant&quot; = m + x
* &quot;Animal&quot; = m + x + y
* &quot;Human&quot; = m + x + y + z

In his theory, these three factors (x, y and z) represent ontological discontinuities. He argues that the differences can be likened to differences in dimension; and from one perspective it could be argued that only humans have actualized existence insofar as they possess life, consciousness and self-consciousness. Schumacher uses this perspective to contrast with the materialistic scientism view, which argues that what is true is inanimate matter, denying the realness of life, consciousness and self-consciousness, despite the fact each individual can verify those phenomena from their own experience.

He directs our attention to the fact that science has generally avoided seriously discussing these discontinuities, because they present such difficulties for strictly materialistic science, and they largely remain mysteries.

Next he considers the animal model of humanity which has grown popular in science. Schumacher notes that within the humanities the distinction between consciousness and self consciousness is now seldom drawn. Consequently, people have become increasingly uncertain about whether there is any difference between animals and humans. Schumacher notes that a great deal of research about humans has been conducted by studying animals. Schumacher argues that this is analogous to studying physics in the hope of understanding life. Schumacher goes on to say that much can be learned about humanity by studying minerals, plants and animals because humans have inherited those levels of being: all, that is, &quot;except that which makes him [sic] human.&quot;

Schumacher goes on to say that nothing is &quot;more conducive to the brutalisation of the modern world&quot; than calling humans the &quot;naked ape&quot;. Schumacher argues that once people begin viewing humans as &quot;animal machines&quot; they soon begin treating them accordingly.

Schumacher argues that what defines humanity are our greatest achievements, not the common run of the mill things. He argues that human beings are open-ended because of self-awareness, which as distinct from life and consciousness has nothing mechanical or automatic about it. For Schumacher &quot;the powers of self awareness are, essentially, a limitless potentiality rather than an actuality. They have to be developed and &#x27;realized&#x27; by each human individual if one is to become truly human, that is to say, a person.&quot;

===Progressions===
Schumacher points out that there are a number of progressions that take place between the levels. The most striking, he believes, is the movement from passivity to activity; there is a change in the origination of movement between each level:
* Cause (Mineral kingdom)
* Stimulus (Plant kingdom)
* Motive (Animal kingdom)
* Will (Humanity)
One consequence of this progression is that each level of being becomes increasingly unpredictable, and it is in this sense that humans can be said to have free will.

He notes increasing integration is a consequence of levels of being. A mineral can be subdivided and it remains of the same composition. Plants are more integrated; but sometimes parts of a plant can survive independently of the original plant. Animals are physically integrated; and so an appendage of an animal does not make another animal. However, while animals are highly integrated physically, they are not integrated in their consciousness. Humans, meanwhile, are not only physically integrated but have an integrated consciousness; however they are poorly integrated in terms of self-consciousness.

Another interesting progression, for him, is the change in the richness of the world at each level of being. A mineral has no world as such. A plant has some limited awareness of its immediate conditions. An animal, however, has a far more rich and complex world. Finally, humans have the most rich and complicated world of all.

===Implications===
For Schumacher, recognizing these different levels of being is vital, because the governing rules of each level are different, which has clear implications for the practice of science and the acquisition of knowledge. Schumacher denies the democratic principles of science. He argues that all humans can practice the study of the inanimate matter, because they are a higher level of being; but only the spiritually aware can know about self-consciousness and possibly higher levels. Schumacher states that &quot;while the higher comprises and therefore in a sense understands the lower, no being can understand anything higher than themselves.&quot;

Schumacher argues that by removing the vertical dimension from the universe and the qualitative distinctions of &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; qualities which go with it, materialistic scientism can in the societal sphere only lead to moral relativism and utilitarianism. While in the personal sphere, answering the question &quot;What do I do with my life?&quot; leaves us with only two answers: selfishness and utilitarianism.

In contrast, he argues that appreciating the different levels of being provides a simple but clear morality. The traditional view, as Schumacher says, has always been that the proper goal of humanity is &quot;...to move higher, to develop one&#x27;s &quot;highest&quot; faculties, to gain knowledge of the &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;highest&quot; things, and, if possible, to &quot;see God&quot;. If one moves &quot;lower&quot;, develops only one&#x27;s &quot;lower&quot; faculties, which we share with the animals, then one makes oneself deeply unhappy, even to the point of despair.&quot; This is a view, Schumacher says, which is shared by all the major religions. Many things, Schumacher says, while true at a lower level, become absurd at a higher level, and vice versa.

Schumacher does not claim there is any scientific evidence for a level of being above self-consciousness, contenting himself with the observation that this has been the universal conviction of all major religions.

==Adequateness==

Schumacher explains that the bodily senses are adequate for perceiving inanimate matter; but we need &#x27;intellectual&#x27; senses for other levels. Schumacher observes that science has shown that we perceive not only with the senses, but also with the mind. He illustrates this with the example of a complex scientific book; it means quite different things to an animal, illiterate man, educated man and scientist. Each person possesses different internal &#x27;senses&#x27; which means they &#x27;understand&#x27; the book in quite different manners.

He argues that the common view that &quot;...the facts should speak for themselves&quot; is problematic because it is not a simple matter to distinguish fact and theory or perception and interpretation. He quotes R. L. Gregory in &quot;Eye and Brain&quot;, &quot;Perception is not determined simply by the stimulus pattern, rather it is a dynamic searching for the best interpretation of data.&quot; He argues that we &#x27;see&#x27; not just with our eyes; but our mental equipment and &quot;since this mental equipment varies greatly from person to person, there are inevitably many things which some people can &#x27;see&#x27; while others cannot, or, to put it differently, for which some people are &quot;adequate&quot; while others are not.&quot;

For him, higher and more significant perceptive abilities are based on the ability to be critically aware of one&#x27;s presuppositions. Schumacher writes &quot;There is nothing more difficult than to be aware of one&#x27;s thought. Everything can be seen directly except the eye through which we see. Every thought can be scrutinised directly except the thought by which we scrutinise. A special effort, an effort of self-awareness is needed — that almost impossible feat of thought recoiling upon itself: almost impossible but not quite. In fact, this is the power that makes man human and also capable of transcending his humanity.&quot;

He notes that for anyone who views the world through materialistic scientism this talk of higher perception is meaningless. For a scientist who believes in materialistic scientism, higher levels of being &quot;simply do not exist, because his faith excludes the possibility of their existence.&quot;

He points out that materialistic science is principally based on the sense of sight and looks only at the external manifestation of things. Necessarily according to the principle of adequateness, materialistic science cannot know more than a small portion of nature. Schumacher argues that by restricting the modes of observation, a limited &quot;objectivity&quot; can be attained; but this is attained at the expense of knowledge of the object as a whole. Only the &#x27;lowest&#x27; and most superficial aspects are accessible to objective scientific instruments.

He notes that science became &quot;science for manipulation&quot; following Descartes. Descartes promised humanity would become &quot;masters and possessors of nature&quot;, a point of view first popularised by Francis Bacon. For Schumacher this was something of a wrong turn, because it meant the devaluation of &quot;science for understanding&quot; or wisdom. One of Schumacher&#x27;s criticisms is that &quot;science for manipulation&quot; almost inevitably leads from the manipulation of nature to the manipulation of people. Schumacher argues that &#x27;science for manipulation&#x27; is a valuable tool when subordinated for wisdom; but until then &quot;science for manipulation&quot; has become a danger to humanity.

Schumacher argues that if materialistic scientism grows to dominate science even further, then there will be three negative consequences:
# Quality of life will fall, because solutions of quantity are incapable of solving problems of quality.
# &#x27;Science for understanding&#x27; will not develop, because the dominant paradigm will prevent it being treated as a serious subject.
# Problems will become insoluble, because the higher powers of man will atrophy through lack of use.

Schumacher argues that the ideal science would have a proper hierarchy of knowledge from pure knowledge for understanding at the top of the hierarchy to knowledge for manipulation at the bottom. At the level of knowledge for manipulation, the aims of prediction and control are appropriate. But as we deal with higher levels they become increasingly absurd. As he says &quot;Human beings are highly predictable as physico-chemical systems, less predictable as living bodies, much less so as conscious beings and hardly at all as self aware persons.&quot;

The result of materialistic scientism is that humanity has become rich in means and poor in ends. Lacking a sense of higher values Western societies are left with pluralism, moral relativism and utilitarianism, and for Schumacher the inevitable result is chaos.

==Four fields of knowledge==
Schumacher identifies four fields of knowledge for the individual:
# I → inner
# I → other persons (inner)
# other persons → I
# I → the world

These four fields arise from combining two pairs: Myself and the World; and Outer Appearance and Inner Experience. He notes that humans only have direct access to fields one and four.

Field one is being aware of your feelings and thoughts and most closely correlates to self awareness. He argues this is fundamentally the study of attention. He differentiates between when one&#x27;s attention is captured by the item it focusses upon, which is when a human being functions much like a machine; and when a person consciously directs their attention according to their choosing. This for him is the difference between &quot;being lived&quot; and living.

Field two is being aware of what other people are thinking and feeling.

Despite these problems, we do experience a &quot;meeting of minds&quot; with other individuals at certain times. People are even able to ignore the words actually said, and say something like &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with what you are saying; but I do agree with what you mean.&quot; Schumacher argues that one of the reasons we can understand other people is through bodily experience, because so many bodily expressions, gestures and postures are part of our common human heritage.

Schumacher observes that the traditional answer to the study of field two has been &quot;You can understand others to the extent you understand yourself.&quot; Schumacher points out that this is a logical development of the principle of &quot;adequateness&quot;: how can you understand someone&#x27;s pain unless you too have experienced pain?

Field three is understanding oneself as an objective phenomenon. Knowledge in field three requires a person to be aware of what other people think of them. Schumacher suggests that the most fruitful advice in this field can be gained by studying the Fourth Way concept of &quot;external considering&quot;.

Schumacher observes that relying on just field one knowledge makes one feel that they are the centre of the universe; while focusing on field three knowledge makes one feel that they are far more insignificant. Seeking self-knowledge via both fields provides more balanced and accurate self-knowledge.

Field four is the behaviourist study of the outside world. Science is highly active in this area of knowledge, and many people believe it is the only field in which true knowledge can be gained. For Schumacher, applying the scientific approach is highly appropriate in this field.

Schumacher summarises his views about the four fields of knowledge as follows:
* Only when all four fields of knowledge are cultivated can one have true unity of knowledge. Instruments and methodologies of study should only be applied to the appropriate field they are designed for.
* Clarity of knowledge depends on relating the four fields of knowledge to the four levels of being.
* The instructional sciences should confine their remit to field four, because it is only in the field of &quot;appearances&quot; that mathematical precision can be obtained. The descriptive sciences, however, are not behaving appropriately if they focus solely on appearances, and must delve in meaning and purpose or they will produce sterile results.
* Self-knowledge can only be effectively pursued by balanced study of field one and field three.
* Study of field two (understanding other individuals) is dependent on first developing a powerful insight into field one (self awareness).

==Two types of problems==

Schumacher argues that there are two types of problems in the world: convergent and divergent. For him, discerning whether a problem is convergent or divergent is one of the arts of living.

Convergent problems are ones in which attempted solutions gradually converge on one solution or answer. An example of this has been the development of the bicycle. Early attempts at developing human-powered vehicles included three- and four-wheelers and involved wheels of different sizes. Modern bicycles look much the same nowadays.

Divergent problems are ones which do not converge on a single solution. A classic example he provides is that of education. Is discipline or freedom the best way to teach? Education researchers have debated this issue for thousand of years without converging on a solution.

He summarises by saying that convergent problems are those that are concerned with the non-living universe. While divergent problems are concerned with the universe of the living, and so there is always a degree of inner experience and freedom to contend with. According to Schumacher, the only solution to divergent problems is to transcend them, arguing that in education, for instance, that the real solution involves love or caring; love and discipline work effectively, but so does love and freedom.

==Art==
Schumacher, in a digression from his main argument, discusses the nature and importance of art. He notes that there is considerable confusion about the nature and meaning of art; but argues that this confusion dissipates when one considers art with relation to its effect on human beings. Most art fits into two categories. If art is designed to primarily affect our feelings then it is entertainment; while if art is primarily designed to affect our will then it is propaganda.

Great art is a multi-faceted phenomenon, which is not content to be merely propaganda or entertainment; but by appealing to people&#x27;s higher intellectual and emotional faculties, it is designed to communicate truth. When entertainment and propaganda are transcended by, and subordinated to, the communication of truth, art helps develop our higher faculties and that makes it &quot;great&quot;.

==Tasks of humanity==

Schumacher notes that within philosophy there is no field in more disarray than ethics. He argues that this is because most ethical debate sidesteps any &quot;prior clarification of the purpose of human life on the earth.&quot; Schumacher believes that ethics is the study of divergent problems; which require transcendence by the individual, not a new type of ethics to be adopted by all.

He argues that there is an increasing recognition among individuals that many solutions to human problems must be made by individuals, not by society, and cannot be solved by political solutions that rearrange the system. For Schumacher, the &quot;modern attempt to live without religion has failed.&quot;

He says that the tasks of an individual can be summed up as follows:
# Learn from society and tradition.
# Interiorize this knowledge, learn to think for yourself and become self-directed.
# Grow beyond the narrow concerns of the ego.

Humanity, he says, in the larger sense must learn again to subordinate the sciences of manipulation to the sciences of wisdom; a theme he further develops in his book &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;.

<doc id="1273903" wikidata="Q267816" url="?curid=1273903" title="Duchy of Benevento">
<text>The Duchy of Benevento was the southernmost Lombard duchy in the Italian Peninsula that was centered in Benevento, a city in Southern Italy. Lombard dukes ruled Benevento from 571 to 774, when the Kingdom of the Lombards was conquered by the Kingdom of the Franks. Being cut off from the rest of the Lombard possessions by the papal Duchy of Rome, Benevento always had held some degree of independence. Only during the reigns of Grimoald (r. 662–671) and the kings from Liutprand (r. 712–744) on was the duchy closely tied to the Kingdom of the Lombards. After the fall of the kingdom in 774, the duchy became the sole Lombard territory which continued to exist as a rump state, maintaining its &quot;de facto&quot; independence for nearly 300 years as the Principality of Benevento.

Paul the Deacon referred to Benevento as the &quot;Samnite Duchy&quot; (&quot;Ducatum Samnitium&quot;) after the region of Samnium.

==Foundation==
The circumstances surrounding the creation of the duchy are disputed. According to some scholars, Lombards were present in southern Italy well before the complete conquest of the Po Valley: the duchy by these accounts would have been founded in 571. The Lombards may have entered later, around 590. Whatever the case, the first duke was Zotto, a leader of a band of soldiers who descended the coast of Campania. Though at first independent, Zotto was eventually made to submit to the royal authority of the north. His successor was Arechis, his nephew, and the principle of hereditary succession guided the Beneventan duchy to the end.

The Lombard duchies, part of the loosely-knit Lombard kingdom, were essentially independent, in spite of their common roots and language, and law and religion similar to that of the north, and in spite of the Beneventan dukes&#x27; custom of taking to wife women from the royal family. A swathe of territory that owed allegiance to Rome or to Ravenna separated the dukes of Benevento from the kings at Pavia. Cultural autonomy followed naturally: a distinctive liturgical chant, the Beneventan chant, developed in the church of Benevento: it was not entirely superseded by Gregorian chant until the 11th century. A unique Beneventan script was also developed for writing Latin. The 8th-century writer Paul the Deacon arrived in Benevento in the retinue of a princess from Pavia, the duke&#x27;s bride. Settled into the greatest of Beneventan monasteries, Monte Cassino, he wrote first a history of Rome and then a history of the Lombards, the main source for the history of the duchy to that time as well.

==Expansion==

Under Zotto&#x27;s successors, the duchy was expanded against the Byzantine Empire. Arechis, himself from the duchy of Friuli, captured Capua and Crotone, and sacked Byzantine Amalfi, but was unable to capture Naples. After his reign, Byzantine holdings in southern Italy were reduced to Naples, Amalfi, Gaeta, Sorrento, Calabria, and the maritime cities of Apulia (Bari, Brindisi, Otranto, etc.). In 662, Duke Grimoald I (duke since 647), went north to aid the King Godepert against his brother, the co-king Perctarit, and instead killed the former, forced the latter into exile, and captured Pavia. As king of the Lombards, he tried to reinstate Arianism over the Catholicism of the late king Aripert I. However, Arianism was disappearing even in the duchy, as was the distinction between the ethnic Lombard population and the Latin- and Greek-speaking one. In 663, the city itself was besieged by the Byzantines during the failed attempt of Constans II, who had disembarked at Taranto, to recover southern Italy. Duke Romuald I defended the city bravely, however, and the Emperor, also fearing the arrival of Romuald&#x27;s father, King Grimoald, retired to Naples. However, Romuald intercepted part of the Roman army at Forino, between Avellino and Salerno, and destroyed it. A peace between the Duchy and the Eastern Empire was signed in 680.

In the following decades, Benevento conquered some territories from the Byzantines, but the main enemy of the duchy was now the northern Lombard kingdom itself. King Liutprand intervened several times to impose a candidate of his own on the ducal throne. His successor, Ratchis, declared the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento foreign countries where it was forbidden to travel without royal permission.

==Secundum Ticinum==
In 758, king Desiderius briefly captured Spoleto and Benevento, but with Charlemagne&#x27;s conquest of the Lombard kingdom in 774, Arechis II tried to claim the royal dignity and make Benevento a &quot;secundum Ticinum&quot;: a second Pavia (the old Lombard capital). Seeing that this was impractical and would draw Frankish attention to himself, he opted instead for the title of &quot;princeps&quot; (prince). In 787, he was forced by Charlemagne&#x27;s siege of Salerno to submit to Frankish suzerainty.

<text>Salonta (; , colloquially , ; ) is a city in Bihor County, in the geographical region of Crișana, north-western Romania, near the Hungarian border.

==Population==


According to the 2021 census, Salonta has a population of 15,792. At the census from 2011, the city had a population of 17,042, made up of Hungarians (58.1%), Romanians (38.83%), Romani (2.4%), Slovaks (0.4%), and others (0.5%). In terms of religion, at the 2002 census, 51.12% were Reformed (Calvinist), 36.46% Romanian Orthodox, 6.56% Roman Catholic and 5.86% was split between Baptists, Romanian Greek-Catholic, Pentecostals, and other faiths.

==History==
The city, a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, was first documented in 1214 under the name of &quot;Zolonta&quot; and in 1332 a Papal document used the name &quot;Zalanta&quot;. The Hungarian spelling &quot;Szalonta&quot; was used since 1587.

Etymologically, the name is probably related with those of other Romanian localities (slavic names) like Slatina, Zlatna, or Slănic, whose Romanian meaning is &quot;Sărata&quot; (&quot;Saline&quot;). It can also be derived from Hungarian &quot;szalona&quot; (&quot;bacon&quot;), a term having the same etymological meaning, and in regional context – the name of two contiguous villages are probably related with the types of stock growth in the area: Mădăras, from Hungarian &quot;madar&quot; (&quot;bird&quot;), and Tulca from Hungarian &quot;tulok&quot; (&quot;bullock&quot;) – it may refer to the numerous pig growers in its perimeter.

Until the 16th century, it was only a small village of about 300 inhabitants and was on the land of the Toldi family. A bigger city was the fort of Culișer, which was however destroyed by the Ottoman Turks in 1598. Culiser was never rebuilt and Salonta began to have a more important role in the region after 1606, when the prince of Transylvania, Stephan Bocskai settled 300 soldiers here and appropriated land for them. They built their own farms, but had to keep their arms ready to repel an attack by the Turks. 3 June, the day in which the soldiers were settled, is nowadays declared &quot;the day of the city&quot;. However, Ottoman Turks captured the town in 1660 and as , it became the sanjak center of Varat vilayet until 1692.

The 19th century Hungarian poet János Arany was born and lived in Salonta for most of his life. Lajos Zilahy, another noted Hungarian author, was also born in Salonta in 1891. Violist and musicologist Egon Kenton was born there the same year.

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of Salonta in April 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The city officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. During the interwar period, it became the seat of plasa Salonta, in Bihor County. In August 1940, under the auspices of Nazi Germany, which imposed the Second Vienna Award, Hungary retook the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included Salonta) from Romania. Towards the end of World War II, however, the city was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces in October 1944, during the initial stages of the Battle of Debrecen. The territory of Northern Transylvania remained under Soviet military administration until 9 March 1945, after which it became again part of Romania. The Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 reaffirmed the Trianon border. Following the administrative reform of 1950, the town became the seat of Salonta Raion within Bihor Region (renamed Oradea Region in 1952 and Crișana Region in 1960). In 1968, the old territorial division into &quot;județe&quot; was reinstituted, and the city reverted to being part of Bihor County.

<doc id="1273907" wikidata="Q78349" url="?curid=1273907" title="Levin Schücking">
<text>Levin Schücking (full name: &quot;Christoph Bernhard Levin Matthias Schücking&quot;; September 6, 1814 – August 31, 1883) was a German novelist. He was born near Meppen, Kingdom of Prussia, and died in Bad Pyrmont, German Empire. He was the uncle of Levin Ludwig Schücking.

==Biography==
Born into the Westphalian nobility on the estate of Klemenswerth, near Meppen, his mother, Sibilla Katharina &quot;née&quot; Busch (1791–1831) was a poet who occasionally published, whilst his father was Paulus Modestus Schücking. Levin&#x27;s mother became friend of the poet Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, who wrote her son a letter of introduction when he left home for the gymnasium in Münster. Shortly after he left home, his mother died, and Baroness von Droste-Hülshoff did her best to fill this void in his life.

After studying law at Munich, Heidelberg and Göttingen, Schücking wished to enter the government judicial service, but, confronted by serious difficulties, abandoned the legal career, and settling at Münster in 1837, devoted himself to literary work. In 1841 he removed to Schloss Meersburg on the Lake of Constance.

In 1843, Schücking married Baroness Luise von Gall. 
Up to this time, Droste-Hülshoff had been a major inspiration in his life, but she and his wife did not get along. 
Droste-Hülshoff felt he neglected her and that his head was too turned by the revolutionary &quot;Young Germany&quot;. 
And then Schücking published a novel on the Westphalian nobility, which did not depict them favorably, and Droste-Hülshoff&#x27;s friends, sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly, traced many of the depictions back to Droste-Hülshoff. 
This annoyance led to her avoiding Schücking for the rest of her life.

Also in 1843, he joined the editorial staff of the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; in Augsburg, and in 1845, he joined that of the &quot;Kölnische Zeitung&quot; in Cologne as a literary editor and occasional foreign correspondent. In 1852 he left his career in journalism for his estate in Sassenberg near Münster to have more time for writing. He died at Pyrmont on 31 August 1883.

==Works==
His first efforts were descriptive:
*&quot;Das Malerische und romantische Westfalen&quot; (1842)
*&quot;Der Dom zu Köln und seine Vollendung&quot; (1842)

Among his numerous romances, which are distinguished by good taste and patriotic feeling, largely reflecting the sound, sturdy character of the Westphalians, the most noteworthy include:
*&quot;Ein Schloss am Meer&quot; (1843)
*&quot;Ein Sohn des Vosges&quot; (1849)
*&quot;Ein Staatsgeheimnis&quot; (1854)
*&quot;Verschlungene Wege&quot; (1867)
*&quot;Die Herberge der Gerechtigkeit&quot; (1879)
Schucking wrote a number of short stories:
*&quot;Aus den Tagen der grossen Kaiserin&quot; (1858)
*&quot;Neue Novellen&quot; (1877)

In &quot;Annette von Droste-Hülshoff&quot; (1862) he gives a sketch of this poet and acknowledges his indebtedness to her beneficial influence upon his mind. There appeared posthumously, &quot;Lebenserinnerungen&quot; (1886) and &quot;Briefe von Annette von Droste-Hülshoff und Levin Schücking&quot; (1893).

His wife, Luise (1815–1855), daughter of the General Freiherr von Gall, in the Hessian service, published some novels and romances of considerable merit. Among the latter may be mentioned &quot;Gegen den Strom&quot; (1851) and &quot;Der neue Kreuzritter&quot; (1853). She also wrote a successful comedy, &quot;Ein schlechtes Gewissen&quot; (1842).

Schücking&#x27;s &quot;Gesammelte Erzählungen und Novellen&quot; appeared in 6 vols (1859–1866); &quot;Ausgewählte Romane&quot; (12 vols, 1864; 2nd series, also 12 vols, 1874–1876).

Several of Schücking&#x27;s works appeared in the popular German weekly &quot;Die Gartenlaube&quot; (such as &quot;Pulver und Gold&quot; in January 1871).

==Sources==
* Carl Schurz, &quot;Reminiscences&quot; (3 vols.), New York: McClure Publ. Co., 1907, Vol. 1, Ch. 3, p. 65. Schurz recalls how, as an aspiring writer attending a gymnasium in Cologne, he sent a manuscript to Schücking requesting an appointment to get his opinion on the work. Schücking granted the appointment, but told the disappointed boy he should regard the work as a &quot;study.&quot; Schurz later appreciated the wisdom of this advice.

<text>The Romanian Football Federation (; FRF) is the governing body of football in Romania. They are headquartered in the capital city of Bucharest and affiliated with FIFA and UEFA since 1923 and 1955 respectively. The Federation organizes the men&#x27;s national team and the women&#x27;s national team, as well as most of the Romanian football competitions.

== History ==

In 1909, the first governing body for the activity of football players appeared, the Association of Sports Clubs in Romania, which later became the &quot;Association of Football Clubs&quot;, with headquarters in Bucharest and Mario Gebauer as president. Also in 1909, the first national football championship began, which will be won, in the spring of the following year, by &quot;Olimpia&quot; Bucharest, which was the first team established in Romania in 1904.

On December 1, 1912, the &quot;Association of Football Clubs&quot; joined the Central Football Association Commission (president Mario Gebaur, secretary Lazăr Breyer), which in turn was part of the Federation of Romanian Sports Associations (FSSR), also established in 1912.

The &quot;Venus&quot; Bucharest and &quot;Prahova&quot; Ploiesti teams will appear in 1915; &quot;Student Sports&quot; Bucharest, in 1916; CA Oradea and &quot;Chinese&quot; Timisoara in 1910, and AMFA Arad, in 1911, according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Physical Education and Sport in Romania&quot;. The Romanian national team began its activity on June 8, 1922, in a match in Belgrade, against Yugoslavia, winning 2–1.

On May 20, 1923, the Association Football Commission of the FSSR was admitted to the Zurich Congress as a member of FIFA. In this capacity, Romania participated in the Olympic Football Tournament from the 1924 Olympic Games held in Paris. On February 16, 1930, the Central Football Association Commission was transformed into the Romanian Football Association Federation (FRFA), an independent body with legal authority, deciding Romania&#x27;s participation in the World Championship in Uruguay in July of the same year.

The first president of the FRFA was the lawyer Aurel Leucutia (1930–1933), who has the merit of having organized the first unitary championship of the first division (1932–1933), states the website of the Romanian Football Federation, &quot;frf.ro&quot;.

The domestic championship, Division A, began with the 1932-1933 edition, initially being divided into two series. In 1934 Division B appeared; in 1936, Division C; and in 1937, the National Junior Championship. The political events at the end of 1989 determined essential organizational changes, as well as regarding the football activity.

In the competitive year 1990–91, a massive group of the most valuable Romanian players went abroad, being requested by big continental clubs.

On February 23, 1991, the General Assembly of the FRF adopted the new statute, elected the federal council, and by court decision no. 290, of April 12, 1991, FR de Fotbal became a legal entity under private law, equivalent to autonomy and thus having the path open to professionalism, mentions the &quot;Encyclopedia of Physical Education and Sport in Romania&quot;. On August 1, 1991, through a decision of the Government, the transition to professionalism was approved. From 1930 until the current president of the Federation, there were 28 other leaders of the FRF. Among them, the prefect of the Capital in the 30s, Gabriel Marinescu (1936–1940), the engineer, sports journalist and coach Virgil Economu (1946–1947), the politician Corneliu Mănescu (1958–1960), the former great player of the CCA, Gheorghe Popescu (1963–1967), Mircea Angelescu (1969–1975 and 1986–1989), Andrei Rădulescu (1989–1990), Mircea Pascu (Jan. 1990–Aug. 1990), Mircea Sandu, (Aug. 1990–Mar. 2014).

Currently, the Romanian Football Federation is led by Răzvan Burleanu (since March 2014). FRF organized the national football championship year after year until 1997, when it was decided to take over and organize it by the Professional Football League (LPF).

The Romanian Football Federation is a founding member of the European Football Association (UEFA) since 1954.

<doc id="1273909" wikidata="Q2071757" url="?curid=1273909" title="Perry Belmont">
<text>Perry Belmont (December 28, 1851 – May 25, 1947) was an American politician and diplomat. He served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1881 to 1888.

==Early life and education==
Belmont was born on December 28, 1851, in New York City, the son of Caroline Slidell (née Perry) and financier August Belmont. His maternal grandfather was Commodore Matthew C. Perry. His brothers were Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont and August Belmont Jr.

He attended Everest Military Academy in Hamden, Connecticut; and graduated from Harvard College in 1872; attended the law school in the University of Berlin; and graduated from the Columbia Law School in 1876. He was admitted to the bar that same year.

===Ancestry and memberships===
Through his mother, he was a descendant of Captain Christopher Raymond Perry who had served as a privateer during the American Revolution and was also the father of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and Commodore Matthew C. Perry. By virtue of his descent from Captain Perry, Belmont became a member of the Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution. In 1929 he was elected as a hereditary member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati. He was also a member of the Veteran Corps of Artillery.

==Career==
Belmont practiced law in New York City for five years. Partnered with him in the law firm, Vinton, Belmont &amp; Frelinghuysen, were his cousin, the writer Arthur Dudley Vinton, and George Frelinghuysen, future president of the Ballantine Brewing Company. He and his brother, August Belmont Jr., were also founding members of The Jockey Club.

Elected as a Democrat to the 47th Congress and reelected to the next three Congresses, Belmont served as the U.S. representative for the first district of New York from March 4, 1881, until his resignation on December 1, 1888. During his first term, he was a member of the committee on foreign affairs; noted for his cross-examination of James G. Blaine, the former secretary of state. The cross-examination concerned Blaine&#x27;s relations with a syndicate of American capitalists interested in the development of certain guano deposits in Peru. An attempt was made to show that Blaine&#x27;s efforts toward mediation between Chile and Peru were from interested motives. Belmont served from 1885 to 1887 as chairman of the committee on foreign affairs.

He was appointed United States Minister to Spain in November 1888 and served until May 1889.

On October 6, 1890, Belmont was invested as a Commander of the French Legion of Honor.

In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Belmont served for six weeks in the Army as an Inspector General of the First Division, Second Army Corps, United States Volunteers, with the rank of major. 
When the Consolidated National Bank of New York was organized on July 1, 1902, the fourteen directors included individuals such as Belmont, John W. Griggs, Henry C. Brewster, George Crocker, and Mortimer H. Wagar.

In 1906, Belmont became &quot;permanent president&quot; of the National Publicity Bill Organization, which fought for campaign finance disclosure.

During the First World War, despite being 65 years old, Belmont was commissioned as a captain in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps on May 5, 1917. He was assigned to the Remount Division in Washington, D.C., and was discharged on May 21, 1920.

==Personal life==
In 1899, after 17 years of marriage, Jessie Ann Robbins (1858–1935) divorced Henry T. Sloane (son of William Sloane, the founder of W. &amp; J. Sloane) to marry Perry Belmont. The marriage occurred only five hours after the divorce was decreed and, at the time, was considered scandalous.

Belmont died in Newport, Rhode Island, on May 25, 1947 (age 95 years, 148 days). He is interred along with his parents and his brother August Belmont Jr. in the Belmont family plot in the Island Cemetery in Newport. His former home in Washington, D.C., became the International Temple for the Order of the Eastern Star.

Schneider served as Under-Secretary of State in the Reagan administration, and later became a member of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC). He was one of the signers of the January 26, 1998, PNAC Letter sent to President Bill Clinton that encouraged an attack against Iraq. In that same year he served on the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States, which came to the conclusion that Iraq could develop a ballistic missile capable of striking the US in ten years.

In January 2001, as President George W. Bush prepared to take office, Schneider served on a panel for nuclear weapons issues sponsored by the National Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank. Other members of the panel included Stephen Hadley, Stephen Cambone, and Robert Joseph, who later were appointed to senior positions in the Bush administration. This panel advocated using tactical nuclear weapons as a standard part of the United States defense arsenal.

In 2001 he was appointed by the US Senate to the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry.

Schneider was selected by Donald Rumsfeld to chair the Defense Science Board. In this position, Schneider continued to advocate using nuclear weapons in certain limited first-strike situations.

<text>James Schouler (March 20, 1839 – April 16, 1920) was an American lawyer and historian best known for his historical work &quot;History of the United States under the Constitution, 1789–1865&quot;.

==Biography==
Schouler was born in West Cambridge (now Arlington), Massachusetts. He was the son of William Schouler, who from 1847 to 1853 edited the &quot;Boston Atlas&quot;, one of the leading Whig journals of New England. He graduated at Harvard in 1859, after which he taught for a year at St. Paul&#x27;s School. He studied law in Boston and was admitted to the bar there in 1862. In 1869 he removed to Washington, where for three years he published the &quot;United States Jurist&quot;.

After his return to Boston in 1874, he devoted himself to office practice and to literary pursuits. He was a lecturer at Boston University School of Law between 1885 and 1903, a non-resident professor and lecturer in the National University Law School, Washington, DC, in 1887–1909, and a lecturer on American history and constitutional law at Johns Hopkins University in 1908.

Schouler is best known, however, as an historian. In 1896–1897 he was president of the American Historical Association. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1907.

He died in Intervale, New Hampshire on April 16, 1920.

==Works==
His most important work is &quot;History of the United States under the Constitution, 1789–1865&quot; (7 vols, 1880–1917) whose components include:
*v. 1. 1783–1801. Rule of Federalism.
*v. 2. 1801–1817. Jefferson Republicans.
*v. 3. 1817–1831. Era of good feeling.
*v. 4. 1831–1847. Democrats and Whigs.
*v. 5. 1847–1861. Free soil controversy.
*v. 6. 1861–1865. The civil war.
*v. 7. 1865–1877. History of the Reconstruction Period.

Among his other publications are:
*&quot;A Life of Thomas Jefferson&quot; (1893)
*&quot;Historical Briefs&quot; (1896)
*&quot;Constitutional Studies, State and Federal&quot; (1897)
*&quot;Life of Alexander Hamilton&quot; (1901)
*&quot;Americans of 1776&quot; (1906)
*&quot;Ideals of the Republic&quot; (1908)

His legal treatises are:
*&quot;The Law of Domestic Relations&quot; (1870)
*&quot;The Law of Personal Property&quot; (1872–1876; new ed., 1907)
*&quot;The Law of Bailments&quot; (1880)
*&quot;The Law of Executors and Administrators&quot; (1883)

<text>Víctor Fernández Braulio (born 28 November 1960) is a Spanish football manager.

He had four spells with his hometown team Zaragoza, winning the Copa del Rey in 1994 and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup a year later. He also led Tenerife, Celta, Real Betis and Deportivo de La Coruña in La Liga, and won the Intercontinental Cup in a brief spell at Porto in 2004.

==Football career==
===Zaragoza===
Fernández was born in Zaragoza, Aragon. Late into the 1990–91 season, aged only 30, he was promoted to hometown Real Zaragoza&#x27;s first team, eventually leading it to the 17th league position and avoiding La Liga relegation in the playoffs against Real Murcia CF; at the time of his beginnings, he was the second youngest manager to ever coach in the league after Xabier Azkargorta.

In the following years, Fernández helped Zaragoza consolidate in the top division, notably reconverting Gus Poyet from forward to attacking midfielder and winning the Copa del Rey in 1994 and the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup the next season. He was relieved of his duties on 8 November 1996, meeting the same fate the following year with his next club, CD Tenerife.

===Celta===
In May 1998, Fernández was appointed to replace Javier Irureta at RC Celta de Vigo, Profiting from the recent Bosman ruling, his team fielded many European Union players such as Claude Makélélé, as well as those from further afield such as the Israeli Haim Revivo and Russian midfield duo Valeri Karpin and Aleksandr Mostovoi; the Galician team played highly attractive football and were known as &quot;EuroCelta&quot; for their performances in continental competitions.

Fernández led Celta in the UEFA Cup in each of his four seasons, reaching the quarter-finals on all but one occasion; highlights included a 3–1 win over Liverpool in November 1998, a 7–0 rout of S.L. Benfica a year later and a 4–0 victory at Juventus FC in March 2000. His team won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in the summer of 2000, with a 4–3 aggregate defeat of FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. Domestically, he surprisingly lost the 2001 Copa del Rey final 3–1 to Zaragoza, who had barely avoided relegation.

===Betis===
Fernández was appointed at fellow top flight team Real Betis in May 2002, after the exit of Juande Ramos. He finished eighth and ninth respectively in his two years, and his team were eliminated from the third round of the UEFA Cup by AJ Auxerre in his first campaign.

===Porto===
In August 2004, Fernández moved abroad and joined Portuguese club FC Porto; the UEFA Champions League holders had dismissed Luigi Delneri before a single competitive game. He won on his debut on 20 August in the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, with new signing Ricardo Quaresma scoring the only goal of a win against rivals Benfica; on 12 December he added the conquest of the last ever Intercontinental Cup with a penalty shootout victory over Colombia&#x27;s Once Caldas.

Domestically, Fernández&#x27;s team gave up their Primeira Liga lead to Benfica on 20 November 2004 when they lost 1–0 at home to neighbours Boavista FC. Home form was a struggle with three wins from the first seven fixtures, including another single-goal defeat to S.C. Beira-Mar two weeks later. He was abruptly dismissed the following January following a 1–3 defeat to S.C. Braga, again at the Estádio do Dragão.

===Returns to Zaragoza and Betis===
Fernández returned to his beloved Zaragoza for the 2006–07 campaign, qualifying the side for the UEFA Cup in his first year but being sacked midway through his second, as the season eventually ended in relegation.

In another return, Fernández joined Betis in late January 2010, replacing fired Antonio Tapia. During his spell the &quot;Verdiblancos&quot; were the team in the league with the most points, but they missed out on promotion from Segunda División after being beaten to promotion places through head-to-head against Hércules CF and Levante UD, despite beating the latter 4–0 on the final day.

===Later years===
On 9 January 2013, Fernández moved for his second experience abroad, signing a contract with Belgium&#x27;s K.A.A. Gent. He was sacked on 30 September 2013, due to poor results.

Fernández was appointed as the new manager of Deportivo de La Coruña on 10 July 2014, succeeding Fernando Vázquez. He was relieved of his duties on 9 April of the following year, with the team eventually narrowly escaping relegation.

In the summer of 2015, Fernández signed for Real Madrid as youth system coordinator. He left the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in 2017, and on 17 December 2018 he returned to Zaragoza for a third stint as manager replacing the dismissed Lucas Alcaraz.

Fernández resigned on 18 August 2020, after losing the play-off semi-finals to Elche CF. On 11 March 2024, after nearly four years without a club, he returned to Zaragoza for his fourth spell.

On 18 December 2024, Fernández resigned again. He announced his decision while holding a press conference, and in the aftermath of a seven-game winless run.

<doc id="1273955" wikidata="Q6929418" url="?curid=1273955" title="Mr Kipling">
<text>Mr Kipling is a brand of cakes, pies and baked goods made in Carlton, South Yorkshire and Stoke-on-Trent, and marketed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and North America. It was introduced in May 1967 (at a time when cakes were more often bought from local bakers), to sell cakes of a local baker&#x27;s standard to supermarkets, and grew to become the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest cake manufacturer by 1976.

Mr Kipling&#x27;s Cakes were made by the RHM subsidiary known as Manor Bakeries Ltd. which also produced products under the Lyons and Cadbury names. The Cadbury cakes are produced under licence from Cadbury plc, the owners of the brand name.

==Branding==
The brand was created in the 1960s by Rank Hovis McDougall, which wanted to boost cake sales and utilise a new bakery. The brand was launched in 1967 and included 20 products sold in premium boxes. The name, Mr. Kipling, was invented for marketing purposes.

With advertising using the phrase &quot;exceedingly good cakes&quot;, and television adverts which originally featured the voice of actor James Hayter, the brand had become the market leader in the United Kingdom by 1976, a position it still holds over forty years later. Varieties of single-serving and individually wrapped cakes have also been marketed.

Around 2005, the manufacturers briefly experimented with another new logo and a striking pack design: pack-fronts simply consisting of the words &quot;Mr Kipling&quot;, the name of the cake, and the phrase &quot;Exceedingly good cakes&quot; in a more formal, classic typeface; the only image of the cake on each pack-front was a close-up of one part of it, used as a background image for the entire pack. Around the same time, the write-ups on the back of their packaging once again purported to be written by the person of Mr Kipling. Shortly afterwards, however, the pack design and brand image wholeheartedly returned to its roots. The logo introduced at the time was very closely based on the original one, featuring a traditional-style font in a gold-edged shape, the packs feature images of the cake(s), and various product features and write-ups are featured on the pack-front. In 2009, the pack designs were slightly revamped, with more emphasis put on the name of each product; the write-ups on the back of the pack no longer purport to be written by Mr Kipling.

Premier Foods also introduced what it termed &#x27;Snap Pack&#x27; packaging (now renamed &#x27;Snack Pack&#x27;), providing cakes in individually sealed plastic packs to keep them fresh. It quickly became a top-seller for the brand.

In 2018, the brand redesigned their packaging for the North American and Australian markets. The new design aimed for a more contemporary and distinctive look to attract new customers, steering away from Mr. Kipling&#x27;s heritage. However, Mr. Kipling&#x27;s wordmark logo remained the same. Furthermore, the brand&#x27;s UK slogan &quot;exceedingly good cakes&quot; was replaced with &quot;make every day delicious&quot; for the international market.

Mr Kipling French Fancies are small sponge cakes, topped with a hemisphere of vegetable-oil &quot;buttercream&quot;. The cakes are coated with fondant icing, with several varieties drizzled with a second colour. Standard varieties are pink (&quot;vanilla&quot;) with white drizzle, yellow (&quot;lemon&quot;) with brown drizzle, and brown (chocolate) with dark brown drizzle.

While cocoa is cited in the ingredients list, strawberry and lemon are not. The cakes are 30% sugar.

French Fancies were among the 20 varieties of cake that were part of the initial Mr Kipling launch in 1967.

In September 2008, Mr Kipling announced the Big French Fancy, a large cake which can be sliced into portions. A limited edition appeared in 2012, renamed British Fancies, containing cakes in red, white and blue. Supermarket and home-made copies are called Fondant Fancies.

Before the town of Hamina and municipality of Vehkalahti consolidated at the beginning of 2003, Husula was part of Vehkalahti. Together with the neighboring Salmenkylä, it comprises one of the biggest population centers in Hamina, with a population of nearly 2,000.

Husula has played a part in Finnish history. In the 18th century when Sweden and Russia were at war, Swedish King Gustav III and his army rested in Husula before they tried to attack Russian-occupied Hamina.

Husula has two old cemeteries which are separated by the National road 7. Formerly the northern cemetery belonged to the Vehkalahti congregation and the southern one to the Hamina congregation, but now they both belong to the unified Hamina congregation.

<text>Little Big Adventure 2 is a 1997 adventure game developed by Adeline Software International and published by Electronic Arts.

It was later re-released by Activision in July 1997 in North America under the name Twinsen&#x27;s Odyssey. In July 1997, both Electronic Arts and Virgin Interactive Software re-released &quot;LBA 2&quot; - Virgin Interactive Software doing so under the name of &quot;Twinsen&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;. &quot;LBA 2&quot; sold over 300,000 copies worldwide. Versions for Sega Saturn and PlayStation were planned but never released.

The game is a sequel to &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; (also known as &quot;Relentless: Twinsen&#x27;s Adventure&quot;). &quot;LBA 2&quot; was also the third game created under the label of Adeline Software International. The game features three-dimensional environments and full-motion video, and all of its music is in CD-DA quality.

In October 2011 &quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; was re-released digitally on GOG.com and in October 2015 on Steam. In October 2021 both Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 engines source codes were released under the GPL.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; has two viewing modes - for indoor scenes it uses a 3D isometric perspective like its predecessor, but for outdoor scenes a 3D perspective view is used. All characters and vehicles are 3D polygon-based objects, allowing for full rotation and movement abilities. The interior game field is divided in scenes (a small block of the game that is active). After completion of certain tasks the player is presented with a full motion video sequence. All text in the game is spoken by the characters. Essentially every character in the game is interactive and will respond differently when Twinsen speaks to them. Enemies are often performing tasks while the game world is active.

Like its predecessor, &quot;LBA 2&quot; is real-time adventure. It combines several action game/arcade sequences and some elements from the role-playing game genre. The game&#x27;s gameplay is partially free-roaming, allowing the player to travel around the islands once they have been &quot;unlocked&quot; by completing certain objectives; there are also many tasks which are optional or non-linear. Certain locations in the game are initially blocked from the player until they progress to a certain stage.

The world in &quot;LBA 2&quot; is considered extremely large and varied for games of its time. There are three planets to visit, with Twinsun and Zeelich containing their own islands, each with their own unique graphical style. Compared to &quot;LBA&quot; which was based only on Twinsun but covered the entirety of that planet, &quot;LBA 2&quot; only revisits Citadel Island and Desert Island from its predecessor. Emerald Moon serves as a setting for a small part of the game. Rather, the latter part of &quot;LBA 2&quot; is set on Zeelich which is a two-layered planet with numerous points of interest on each layer.

==Plot==
After Twinsen defeated Dr. FunFrock at the end of &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot;, peace had returned to Twinsun. The events of &quot;LBA 2&quot; take place several years later, as a heavy thunderstorm develops over Citadel Island. Twinsen&#x27;s Dino-Fly, a creature encountered in &quot;LBA&quot;, is struck by lightning mid-air and crash-lands in Twinsen and Zoe&#x27;s garden. Twinsen is advised to seek help from Ker&#x27;aooc, a healing wizard who lives on Desert Island, but ferry crossings are cancelled due to inclement weather. He aids Bersimon, the island&#x27;s weather wizard, who then uses magic to calm the storm. Immediately after the sky clears, alien creatures, who call themselves Esmers, land on the planet, under a false diplomatic guise. After hearing of a mass disappearance of the wizards&#x27; children, Twinsen searches for clues as to their whereabouts. The Esmers use their army to secretly capture Twinsun&#x27;s Children and openly invite the Wizards to their home planet, Zeelich (which is revealed later to be a trap to capture them). After graduating as a wizard, Twinsen is informed by his master of the possible plot of the Esmers and is sent to investigate their planet by accepting their invitation to all Wizards. 

Once Twinsen lands on Zeelich (which resembles Venus), he is accidentally identified by another Twinsunian in front of Esmer guards, who proceed to arrest him on the landing port. After tricking one of the guards with the help of another prisoner, Twinsen manages to escape imprisonment and escapes Zeelich in one of the Esmer spaceships. Returning to Twinsun, he crashes the spaceship the mountains of Citadel Island, where he is attacked by an Esmer soldier. After defeating him and making his way into the city, he discovers that the Esmers have taken over Twinsun and have imposed martial law. After going home to check on Zoe he finds out that Baldino has left him a protopack (Prototype Jetpack; it can hover, not fly) in the warehouse, he retrieves it and sets out to find his friend. Once making it to Desert Island he finds out that Baldino has disappeared; he proceeds to investigate his house and discovers that Baldino has built a spacecraft and for some reason went to Emerald Moon (Twinsun&#x27;s moon). Twinsen visits the School of Magic and learns from his master that in order to proceed in his journey and face the Esmers, who prove to be more than he can handle, he must obtain a powerful artifact from beneath Citadel Island. 

Twinsen then discovers the secret Esmer base on Desert Island beneath the Temple of Bù (an important location in the first game), then hijacks an Esmer spaceship to travel to Emerald Moon. At Emerald Moon, Twinsen frees Baldino from imprisonment at a Zeelichian base and they take Baldino&#x27;s spacecraft to Zeelich.

Like Twinsun, Zeelich is home to four native sapient species: Sups, Francos, Wannies, and Mosquibees. Unlike Twinsun, it is a two-layered planet; the upper layer is located above a sea of toxic gas that plagues the planet, while The lower layer is located beneath the gas and is covered in a sea of lava. Its inhabitants await the day when a certain prophecy will be fulfilled, when Dark Monk, their shadow god, will emerge and restore Zeelich to its original hospitable state.

After assistance from Esmer rebels, Twinsen discovers that the Emperor of Zeelich had made a deal with the Dark Monk. In doing Dark Monk&#x27;s bidding, Esmers were sent to take over Twinsun and the Emerald Moon. Twinsen eventually gathers together four fragments of a key which must be placed inside a temple on Celebration Island. Twinsen unmasks Dark Monk, who is really FunFrock, the villain from the first game. FunFrock deceived the Esmers so they could carry out his plan to destroy Twinsun in order for him to steal the powers of Sendell, the goddess of the planet. After overcoming FunFrock and his clone army, Twinsen attempts to stop Emerald Moon from crashing into the Twinsun but is unsuccessful even with Sendell&#x27;s powers. Fortunately, the Esmers, who are freed of Dark Monk&#x27;s deception, intervene and destroy the rocket engine upon Emerald Moon. Afterwards, the Esmers reconcile with the residents of Twinsun, while Twinsen and Zoe&#x27;s baby is born.

==Development==
The music of &quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; is composed by the French composer Philippe Vachey.

==Reception==
&quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; sold above 300,000 units by August 1999. According to &quot;GameSpot&quot;, poor sales of the preceding LBA game meant that Twinsen remained an obscure character in USA and resulted in the commercial failure of LBA2 in that market, in contrast to France where Twinsen was famous as a result of LBA&#x27;s success. Some of the English voice acting was also criticized as corny compared to the original French dialogue.

Robert Coffey of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that the game has unparalleled sense of marvel and imagination, engaging story, and deft mix of action and adventure. GameSpot&#x27;s Ron Dulin gave the game 8.1 out of 10, saying that the fans of adventure games will not miss this title. José Dias of &quot;Adventure Classic Gaming&quot; called &quot;Relentless: Twinsen&#x27;s Adventure&quot; an original and intriguing adventure game and gave it a 4 out of 5.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; rated it four stars out of five, generally praising the gameplay and the story, and recommended to anyone who loves action/adventure games.

&quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1997 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;. The editors called &quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; a &quot;charming&quot; 3D action/adventure hybrid.

<doc id="1273970" wikidata="Q6970199" url="?curid=1273970" title="National Affairs">
<text>National Affairs is a quarterly magazine in the United States about political affairs that was first published in September 2009. Its founding editor, Yuval Levin, and authors are typically considered to be conservative and right-wing. The magazine is published by National Affairs, Inc., which previously published the magazines &quot;The National Interest&quot; (1985–2001) and &quot;The Public Interest&quot; (1965–2005). National Affairs, Inc., was originally run by Irving Kristol, and featured board members such as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick, and author Charles Murray.

== History ==
In the editorial in the inaugural issue, editor Yuval Levin elaborated on the magazine&#x27;s mission: &quot;&quot;National Affairs&quot; will have a point of view, but not a party line. It will begin from confidence and pride in America, from a sense that our challenge is to build on our strengths to address our weaknesses, and from the conviction that chief among those strengths are our democratic capitalism, our ideals of liberty and equality under the law, and our roots in the longstanding traditions of the West. We will seek to cultivate an open-minded empiricism, a decent respect for the awesome complexity of life in society, and a healthy skepticism of the serene technocratic confidence that is too often the dominant flavor of social science and public policy. And we will take politics seriously&quot;. The editorial expresses gratitude to the editors of &quot;The Public Interest&quot;, and notes that &quot;the complete archives of &quot;The Public Interest&quot; are available for the first time&quot; on its website.

On September 7, 2009, David Brooks of the &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewed the first issue. He wrote that &quot;&quot;The Public Interest&quot; closed in 2005&quot;, leaving &quot;a gaping hole. Fortunately, a new quarterly magazine called &quot;National Affairs&quot; is starting up today to continue the work.&quot; Brooks continued by noting that the magazine occupied &quot;the bloody crossroads where social science and public policy meet matters of morality, culture and virtue&quot;. &quot;In a world of fever swamp politics and arid, overly specialized expertise,&quot; Brooks wrote in his closing, &quot;&quot;National Affairs&quot; arrives at just the right time.&quot;

&quot;National Affairs&quot; &quot;makes its home at the American Enterprise Institute.&quot;

<text>Boris Eremeevich Vladimirski, (February 27, 1878 – February 12, 1950), was a Soviet painter of the Socialist Realism school.

==Life and work==
Vladimirski was born in Kiev, Ukraine. He began his artistic studies at age 10, later attending the newly established Kiev Art College (1900-1904) where he studied with Ivan Seleznyov, followed by the Academy of Arts and the Anton Ažbe School in Munich (1904-1908). He exhibited his first painting in 1906.

As an official Soviet artist his work was well received and widely exhibited. His works were aimed at exemplifying the work ethic of the Soviet people; they were displayed in many homes and federal buildings. He is also known for his paintings of prominent public officials.

His work &quot;Roses for Stalin&quot; is often considered a classic example of Socialist realism and Soviet propaganda.
”Black Ravens”, which depicts Soviet secret police (NKVD) that came at night to disappear people, is regarded as a piece that transcended the values of Socialist Realism. &quot;It is still unknown how this work passed censorship.&quot;

<text>Samuel Lawrence (April 24, 1754 – April 17, 1827) was an American revolutionary from Groton, Massachusetts.

==Career==
Lawrence fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill under Henry Farwell. Lawrence served in the army for 3 and half years from 1775 to 1778, and rose within the U.S. Army to the rank of major. While in the army he married Susanna Parker on July 22, 1777. He was adjutant under General John Sullivan in the Battle of Rhode Island and served there until he retired from service in 1778. After the war, Lawrence returned to Groton, where he settled as a farmer.

In 1793, he helped to found Groton Academy (now Lawrence Academy at Groton).

<doc id="1274010" wikidata="Q2378457" url="?curid=1274010" title="Islam in South Africa">
<text>South Africa is a Christian majority nation with Islam being a minority religion, practised by roughly 1.6% of the total population. Islam in South Africa has grown in three different phases. The first phase brought the earliest Muslims as part of the involuntary migration of slaves, artisans, political prisoners, and political exiles from the Dutch East Indies to the Cape Colony from 1652 to 1800. The second phase was the arrival of indentured labourers from British India to work in the sugar-cane fields in Natal from 1860 to 1911. Of the approximately 176,000 Indians of all faiths who were transported to the Natal province, almost 7–10% of the first shipment were Muslims.

The third phase has been marked by a wave of African Muslims following the end of apartheid in 1994. Recent figures put the number of these immigrants at approximately between 75,000 and 100,000. In addition, a considerable number of Muslims from South Asia have also arrived as economic migrants. Although the majority of Muslims are Sunni, smaller numbers are Shia, particularly in Cape Town.

==History==
===The VOC period===

In the 17th century, the Dutch controlled East Indies and the Cape. Free Muslim labourers (&quot;Mardyckers&quot;), banished rebels and slaves were taken to the Cape from Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) as free workers, and as slaves. A significant number of slaves from India were also Muslims.

The first recorded arrival of free Muslims known as Mardyckers is in 1658. Mardycka or Maredhika implies freedom. The Mardyckers were people from Amboyna in the southern Moluccas and were brought to the Cape to defend the newly established settlement against the indigenous people, and also to provide labour in the same way that they had been employed at home, first by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch, in Amboyna. Jan Van Riebeeck had requested that the Mardyckers be sent to the Cape as a labour force. The Mardyckers were prohibited from openly practising their religion: Islam. This was in accordance with the Statute of India (drafted by Van Dieman in 1642) which stated in one of its : &quot;No one shall trouble the Amboinese about their religion or annoy them; so long as they do not practise in public or venture to propagate it amongst Christians and heathens. Offenders to be punished with death, but should there be amongst them those who had been drawn to God to become Christians, they were not to be prevented from joining Christian churches.&quot; The same was re-issued on 23 August 1657 by Governor John Maetsuycker probably in anticipation of the advent of the Mardyckers to the Cape of Good Hope. The applied to the Cape as part of the Dutch Colonial Empire.

During the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century the Dutch continued to exile Muslim leaders from Dutch East Indies to the Cape. Many &quot;Indiaanen&quot; and &quot;Mohammedaanen&quot; Muslim political prisoners brought from East Asia were imprisoned on Robben Island. 1667 saw the arrival of first Muslim political exiles banished by the Dutch to the Cape. These political exiles or &quot;Orang Cayen&quot; were Muslim men of wealth and influence who were banished to the Cape from their homeland in the East because the Dutch feared them as a threat to their political and economic hegemony. The first political exiles were the rulers of Sumatra. They were Sheikh Abdurahman Matabe Shah and Sheikh Mahmood. Both were buried in Constantia. From the very outset the Cape authorities accommodated the exiles away from Cape Town as they feared the exiles would escape. A tomb for these political exiles has been erected on &quot;Islam Hill&quot; in Constantia in the Cape. Sheikh Abdurahman Matebe Shah used his exile to consolidate the teaching of Islam among slaves in the Cape.

The next &quot;Orang Cayen&quot; was Sheikh Yusuf of Bantam who arrived on board &#x27;De Voetboog&#x27; on 2 April 1694 along with his family and followers. They were housed on a farm in Zandvleit, near the mouth of the Eerste River in the Cape, far from Cape Town, on 14 June 1694. The company&#x27;s attempt to isolate Shaykh Yusuf at Zandvleit did not succeed. On the contrary, Zandvleit turned out to be the rallying point for &#x27;fugitive&#x27; slaves and other exiles from the East. It was here that the first cohesive Muslim community in South Africa was established. Since the Sheikh and his followers hailed from Macassar, the district around Zandvliet is still known today as Macassar.

Among the political exiles were Tuan Guru, first chief imam in South Africa, and Sheikh Madura, who was exiled in the 1740s and died on Robben Island; his kramat (shrine) is still there today. Sa&#x27;id Alowie (Sayyid &#x27;Alawi), popularly known as Tuan Sa&#x27;id, of Mocca in Yemen, Arabia, arrived at the Cape in 1744 with Hadjie Matarim. They were banished to the Cape by the Dutch and were incarcerated on Robben Island. On his release from Robben Island Tuan Sa&#x27;id settled at the Cape where he worked as a police constable – an occupation which gave him ample opportunities for visiting slave quarters at night to teach. Tuan Sa&#x27;id is known for his active Da&#x27;wah (missionary endeavour) amongst the slaves in the Slave Lodge. He is generally regarded as the first official imam of the Cape Muslims.

In 1767 Prince Abdullah Kadi Abu Salaam of Tidore, Indonesia, was exiled to the Cape. He wrote a copy of the Quran from memory during his incarceration, and the volume is still preserved in Cape Town. He was released from jail in 1793 and establish a madrasah or Islamic school the same year. It is the first madrasah in the country and extremely popular among the slaves and the Free Black community. It played an important role in converting many slaves to Islam. It was also at this madrasah that the literary teaching of Arabic-Afrikaans emerged. It was through his work at the madrasah that he gained the appellation &quot;Tuan Guru&quot;, meaning mister teacher.

In 1793 the growth of the community encouraged Cape Town&#x27;s Muslims to petition the VOC for permission to build a mosque. Tuan Guru became the first imam of the first mosque established at the Cape, the Auwal Mosque. Islam was a popular religion among the slaves – its tradition of teaching enabled literate slaves to gain better positions in their masters&#x27; households, and the religion taught its followers to treat their own slaves well.
===Arrival of Indian Muslims===

In the 1800s there were two groups of Muslims that emigrated to South Africa from South Asia. The first began with a wave of immigration by indentured labourers from South India in the 1860s. These labourers were brought to South Africa by the British. 7–10% of these labourers were Muslim. The second group of immigrants were merchants or traders (&quot;Passenger Indians&quot;) that arrived from North India and settled in Natal, the Transvaal and the Cape. The first mosque in Natal, Jumuah Musjid, was built in Grey Street in Durban in 1881. By 1911, 152,641 Indians had come to Natal.

==== Deobandis ====
Darul Uloom Deoband was established in 1866 in the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, India, as part of the anti-British movement. It gave rise to a traditional conservative Sunni movement known as the Deobandi movement. The Deobandi Movement has an international presence today, with its full-fledged manifestation in South Africa, a country where the movement was initiated through the Indian Gujarati merchant class. The Islamic education system of the Deobandi movement, as well as the necessary components of social and political organizations such as Tablighi Jamaat, Sufism and Jamiat, are fully functioning effectively in South Africa, as they do in India. Madrasas in South Africa provide Islamic higher education and are now centers for Islamic education for foreigners who are interested in receiving a Deobandi-style education. Many of their graduates, especially from Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, are Western students. Some of South African madrasas are recognized globally, providing fatwa services. South Africa is now known for producing exceptional Islamic literature through translation and compilation. Similarly, the Tabligh Jamaat is a hub in South Africa that spreads throughout South and East Africa. Graduates of South African madrassas spend their time in the path of the Tabligh Jamaat. Through the work of several spiritual personalities of the Deobandis, the tradition of Deoband&#x27;s Tasawwuf (Sufism) has taken root in South Africa. Among them are Muhammad Zakariyya al-Kandhlawi, Masihullah Khan, Mahmood Hasan Gangohi and Asad Madni. South African Deobandi Muslims have many important and influential educational and socio-political organizations that educate the people and play an important role in religious and social activities. Among them are Jamiatul Ulama South Africa and the Muslim Judicial Council.

===After apartheid===

After South Africa became a democracy in 1994, there has been a growing number of Muslim migrants from South Asia and North Africa; however, their numbers are fairly low. Most of the non-South African Muslims are urban dwellers and thus live in or near Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London, Kimberley, Pretoria or Johannesburg.

===New rise in conversions===

Even though organisations such as Discover Islam, IPCI, the Islamic Dawah Movement of South Africa, and the Africa Muslim Agency have been eager to proselytise in the region, there have been other civic organisations such as the MYMSA and the Call of Islam who considered other approaches to weave Islam into the social fabric of South Africa as a more significant way of making the Muslims&#x27; presence conspicuous.

According to Michael Mumisa, a researcher and writer on African Islam, there has been an increase in the number of black South Africans converting to Islam particularly among the women and the youth. He believes that for some of the youth and women who were schooled in the politics of South African resistance and confrontation with the security forces of the former Apartheid state, the acceptance of Islam has become part of a radical rejection of a society based on Christian principles which are seen as having been responsible for establishing and promoting the Apartheid doctrine through the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa. The influence of the radical ideas espoused by Malcolm X is very evident among South African Muslims of all races. Branches of the Nation of Islam are already established in South Africa. Louis Farrakhan paid a visit to South Africa and was received by President Nelson Mandela and African Muslim communities.

Another reason has been the presence of a growing Number of Sufi Orders and Groups. Amongst these is the Murabitun, a group that has a strong following in Spain.

==Organisations==
Organisations such as the Jamiat ul-Ulama of the Transvaal (est. 1923), The Muslim Judicial Council (est. 1945), The Cape Town Ulama Board and Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa (est. 1970) enjoyed a fair amount of moral and financial support from the Muslim community for their social welfare activities. The once strong Muslim Students Association of South Africa (est. 1974), which had branches on many tertiary campuses, became less vocal and thus lost its grip on student activities; the MSA was thus replaced by Islamic societies that were either independent or affiliates of other Muslim organisations outside these institutions. There is also a Turkish school Nizamiye Muslim School which was established in 2011. There is also a community of the Chisti way of Tasawwuf.

Salmaan AlFaarsi was founded in 2020 with the vision of educating primarily the indigenous but not restricted to, about Islam and empowering them with financial literacy in order to stop them from being dependent on organizations. Their aim is not that of radicals and extremism but also not lax in upholding the pristine teachings of Islam.

There is emerging black Muslim movement in the township around Gauteng in particular. Gauteng Muslim Shurah Council (GMSC) this is as results of a lot of dissatisfaction with the above organisations who are predominantly Indian and coloured and are viewed as colonising the black thought into indopak version of Islam. The GMSC is now resourced in all Gauteng townships with regional shurah&#x27;s with Amir&#x27;s. Amir Mohammed Gadimang is the leader of this group. With prominent other regional Amir&#x27;s Zaid Langa (Soweto) and Abdul Qadir Mandla Nkosi (Tshwane) who are the biggest regions.

=== Regulatory and Advisory Bodies ===
Besides political parties, a number of Islamic organisations operate in South Africa, looking after various aspects of Muslim life.

Major organisations include the Muslim Judicial Council, whose activities include the provision of Halaal certification of food. The Cape Town Ulama Board (CTUB), a progressive voice whose activities deal with Government dialogue and religious verdicts. The South African Hajj and Umrah Council (SAHUC) looks after the needs of South Africa&#x27;s pilgrims and is responsible for the issuing of Hajj permits. There are many other local organisations that exist to look after the interests of the Muslim communities.

=== Relief Organisations ===
There are many Muslim relief organisations in South Africa serving both Muslim and Non-Muslim causes:
* Jamiatul Ulama Kwa Zulu Natal
* AWQAF SA
* Africa Muslims Agency / Direct Aid International
* Al Imdaad Foundation
* Gift of the Givers led by Imtiaz Sooliman 
* Islamic Relief SA
* Islamic Dawah Movement of South Africa (IDM)
* Muslim Hands SA
* Muslim Refugees Association of South Africa
* Mustadafin Foundation
* CTIEC Ziyaee Welfare
* South African National Zak&#x27;ah Fund
Some of these organisations have their roots in South Africa, while others form part of a larger international organisation.
=== Activism ===
Organisations such as PAGAD have received attention for their fight against gangsterism and drugs. PAGAD consisted of mainly Muslim people, but were joined by people from various religions. PAGAD, as the name suggests, was ostensibly formed to combat the rising trends of gangsterism and drug use. It became known more prominently, however, as proponents of urban terror. They were implicated in over 300 acts of violence, the majority of which involved explosives. PAGAD&#x27;s operations largely ceased after the arrest and prosecution of its leaders in 2000.

===Islamic political parties===
When the first democratic elections took place in April 1994 two Muslim parties emerged, the Africa Muslim Party and the Islamic Party. The AMP contested the National Assembly as well as the provincial legislature and the IP contested only the Western Cape provincial legislature. Neither party was able to secure seats in either legislature.

No Islamic party contested the 1999 elections.

The 2004 elections were contested by the AMP and the Peace and Justice Congress, again without success.

Al Jama-ah was formed in 2007, and won its first seat in 2019, becoming the first Islam-affiliated party to do so.
==Theology==

Most South African Muslims are members of the Sunni branch of Islam; there are also large numbers of Shi&#x27;a and other smaller sects throughout South Africa.

===Sects===
Sunnis make up the majority of South African Muslims followed by Shia Muslims.

====Madhab====
Most of the Indian community follow the Hanafi Madhab, while the Malay, Kokni Indian &amp; East African Communities usually follow the Sha&#x27;afi madhab, which predominates in the Western Cape. There is also an increasingly large number of adherents to the Maliki madhab, composed mostly of recent West African and Maghribi Migrants.

====Scholarship====
The Dominant traditions of scholarship are the rival South Asian Deobandi/Barelvi schools within the Indian Community.

The Malay Community has a much more varied tradition with graduates of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Umm-al Qurra in Mecca &amp; other universities in Saudi Arabia &amp; South Asia. Most of the Indian scholars are graduates from Deobandi affiliated Madrassahs or Sunni Zia Ul Ulooms Like Jamia Razvia Zia Ul Uloom (Rawalpindi – Pakistan).

==Community and interfaith relations==

This religious cohesion is most obvious in the Indian and Coloured residential areas where Muslims live amongst, work with and attend school with fellow South Africans of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, atheist and agnostic beliefs. South African Muslims generally do not segregate themselves from people of other faiths. As per the culture in South Africa, it is not uncommon for South African Muslims, just like their fellow non-Muslims, to shake hands, hug or even kiss (in the case of close friends and distant or close family) as a greeting – even with non-mahrams.
The National Interfaith Leadership Council, which advises President Zuma, includes former Western Cape premiere, Erahim Rasool.

The Muslim community has been affected by a rise in drug abuse, particularly in Cape Town of the drug &quot;Tik&quot; (crystal meth Crime and gangsterism are also visible in the poorer Muslim communities.

Qur&#x27;ans are available in libraries including the National Library.
During the month of Ramadan, many Muslim retail stores, radio stations (public and private), publications and organisations send messages of goodwill to the local Muslim community. Many Muslim stores are closed on Eid-ul-Fitr.

Financial services providers such as First National Bank, ABSA bank, Standard Bank and Nedbank offer Sharia compliant financial solutions and banking products. South Africa also has several branches of Albaraka Bank (of Saudi Arabia), Habib Overseas Bank Ltd and HBZ Bank Ltd, which offers only Shari&#x27;a compliant banking. Oasis Crescent Management Group is also a financial service provider to Muslims in South Africa.Halal food products, butcheries, restaurants are widely available in South Africa although gender segregation is not common within South African society.

==Sharia law in South Africa==

===Marriage===
South Africa is one of the few Muslim minority countries in the world which is considering the implementation of Muslim Personal Law or Muslim Family Law. In 2003, a draft Muslim Marriages Bill was submitted to the Department of Justice. This would allow courts to enforce the marital regulations of sharia law, with the assistance of a Muslim judge and assessors familiar with Islamic law, to protect the rights of Muslim women.

Proponents of the bill believe it would protect the rights of Muslim women as decisions made by legal scholars are not legally binding regarding financial settlements following a divorce.

Questions have been raised about the need for a separate marriage bill for Muslims, and there is lack of consensus in the Muslim community itself on the need for, and structure of the bill.

In May 2023, Al Jamah political party, under the leadership of Ganief Hendricks, made an attempt to have Muslim marriages officially recognized by presenting a private members&#x27; bill to the Minister of Home Affairs. The party received support from the Cape Town Ulama Board, who were present during the proceedings. As of now, discussions on this matter are ongoing.

In 2009, an unsuccessful application was brought before the Constitutional Court of South Africa by a Muslim women&#x27;s organisation, to compel the government to enact the Muslim Marriages bill. During the hearing, Judge Kate O&#x27;Regan stated that, &quot;the question is whether it is acceptable for the state to take over the management of a particular religion&quot;. Judge Albie Sachs commented that &quot;it&#x27;s asking the courts to intrude, in a very profound way, on a very sensitive issue&quot;.
===Halaal certification===
There are a number of Halaal certification authorities, who certify food, retail edible items and restaurants as Halal. There is some disagreement between these organisations. The certifications carry considerable weight amongst South African Muslims.

The most prominent Halaal certification authorities in South Africa are:
* Muslim Judicial Council (MJC)
* South African National Halaal Authority (SANHA)
* National Independent Halaal Trust (NIHT)
* Islamic Council of South Africa (ICSA)

==Education==
The majority of South African Muslims attend mixed gender public schools, while some attend private (mostly Catholic or Anglican) schools, where they are exempt from prayer sessions and Biblical curriculum. Islamic schools also exist under the control of the Association of Muslim Schools (AMS) as well as Madrasahs. The Islamic Schools under AMS offer a syllabus combining secular and Islamic studies. The secular syllabus is taken from the CAPS syllabus issued by the Department of Basic Education while the Islamic studies syllabus is taken from the Taalimi Board affiliated to the Jamiatul Ulama South Africa. Some institutions offer short courses on Islamic teaching, while Islamic Law and Islamic finance studies are also available.

Qu&#x27;ran Study groups are common and Arabic studies are available through private tutoring, or universities such as Wits University and University of the Western Cape.

South Africa has a number of Darul Ulooms around the country. These institutes have students from around the world, including a large number of African students. Some of these institutions include:

* Darul Uloom Pretoria
* Darul Uloom Azaadville
* CTIEC Zia ul Uloom 
* Darul Uloom Qariyya Gharib Nawaaz, Ladysmith, South Africa
* Darul Uloom Newcastle, Newcastle, South Africa
* Darul Uloom Zakariyya
* Darul Taaleemuddeen

==Prominent Muslims in South Africa==

In addition to Cabinet ministers, there are a number of members of parliament as well as councillors in the various provinces. The former Western Cape premier, Ebrahim Rasool, is Muslim (Rasool is currently serving as South Africa&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States of America). Imam Hassan Solomon (Raham) was a member of parliament from 1994 until his death in 2009. He joined the United Democratic Front, seen by many as a front for the banned African National Congress (ANC). During his years in exile in Saudi Arabia, Imam Solomon furthered his Islamic education. Imam Solomon returned to South Africa in 1992, and took up a seat in the National Assembly in Parliament following the first democratic elections in 1994. He served in Parliament until his death in 2009. Naledi Pandor is the minister of Science and Technology, Pandor is the granddaughter of Z.K. Mathews an anti apartheid teacher and a prominent member of the ANC. Naledi converted to Islam after her marriage to Sharif Josef Pandor.

Sheikh Ahmed Badsha Peer was a highly respected Sufi. He arrived in South Africa in 1860 as an indentured labourer and was given an honourable discharge by the colonial British authorities when he was discovered to be mystic. His tomb is at the Badsha Peer Square/Brook Street Cemetery in Durban.

Abu Bakr Effendi was an Ottoman &quot;qadi&quot; of Kurdish descent who was sent in 1862 by the Ottoman sultan Abdulaziz at the request of the British Queen Victoria to the Cape of Good Hope, to teach and assist the Muslim community of the Cape Malays. During his stay at the Cape he produced one of the first works in Afrikaans literature with his work in Arabic Afrikaans, &quot;Uiteensetting van die godsdiens&quot; (&quot;Exposition of the Religion&quot;).

==Media==

===Television===
In South Africa there are three TV channels dedicated to the broadcast of Islamic content: Hilal TV, which is aired on paid satellite platform DSTV; Hijazi Channel, and INX Prime, All these channels broadcast a combination of local and international Islamic content. The once famous ITV on DSTV has shut its doors after lengthy court battles.

Every weekday public TV channel SABC 1 broadcasts short religious programmes before the Siswati/Ndebele news at 17h30. Each day a different religion is represented, with &quot;Reflections on Faith&quot; being the Islamic edition, broadcast on Fridays 17H00-17H02. An &quot;Nur-The Light&quot; is a Muslim religious programme that airs on SABC 1 on Sunday mornings and interfaith programme. &quot;Spirit Sundae&quot; features Muslim event coverage, personal profiles and discusses issues pertaining to the community. &quot;Religions of South Africa&quot; also broadcasts information about Islam. Islam Channel is also available on DSTV to South African Muslims as well as other Muslim programmes on the DSTV Indian Bouqet.

Regional community TV station Cape Town TV (CTV) has weekly broadcasts of pre-recorded Jumuah (Friday) prayer sessions. During the month of Ramadan, CTV also brings viewers lectures from the days of fasting, which broadcasts every night between 21H30-22H30.

===Radio===
Muslim stations in South Africa are limited to regional, or community based coverage. These include &quot;Radio 786 (Cape Town)&quot;, &quot;Radio Islam (Johannesburg)&quot;, &quot;The Voice of the Cape (Cape Town)&quot;, &quot;Channel Islam International (Johannesburg)&quot; and &quot;Radio Al Ansaar (Durban).&quot;&quot;IFM Radio 88.3Fm (Port Elizabeth).

===Print Publications===
Newspapers include Muslim Views, and Al Qalam Newspaper.

==Extremism==
Generally, the local Muslim population are known to be peaceful, tolerant and moderate. However, the US state department listed two South African organisations that it claims were international terrorist organisations: People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) and Qibla.

While Qibla and Pagad were active in violent activity in 2001, since then they have been involved in peaceful marches and protest actions, speaking out against war&#x27;s in Iraq, Gaza, Darfur and other regions across the world.

Critics claim widespread corruption among police and officials, including the black market sale of South African passports, had undermined counter-terrorism efforts.

It was feared prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup that extremists may have carried out attacks during the tournament and there were reports of Somali al-Qaeda, al-Shabab and militant run camps in neighbouring Mozambique. Despite this, no direct threats or attacks materialised.

The Muslim community in the country had organised a campaign to welcome guests into their country and homes, actively dispelling any perceived terrorism threats.

The campaign, labelled &#x27;SA Muslims 2010&#x27;, showcased Islam and Muslims in South Africa through various exhibitions, reflecting some of the community&#x27;s 300-year history.

==Controversies==
===Muhammad cartoons===
In May 2010, the local &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; published a cartoon depicting Muhammad by Jonathan Shapiro (a.k.a. Zapiro) which sparked some uproar from the Muslim community. Death threats were made to Mr. Shapiro and the editor of the newspaper. An emergency court interdict was sought by The Council of Muslim Theologians (Jamiatul Ulama) to prevent the publishing of the cartoon, however the petition was denied by the presiding judge – who is herself a Muslim. The judge earlier chose not to recuse herself saying that her religious beliefs would not influence her. Zapiro created the cartoon in response to international outrage over the &quot;Everybody Draw Muhammad Day&quot; campaign of Facebook. Zapiro depicts the prophet Muhammad on a psychologist&#x27;s couch moaning that, &quot;other prophets have followers with a sense of humour!&quot;. The council stated that they feared violence in response and that the drawing may put the security of the 2010 FIFA World Cup at risk from extremists. It said that though it does not advocate violence, it would not be able to ensure that there would not be any. The editor of the paper said that, &quot;&quot;My view is no cartoon is as insulting to Islam as the assumption Muslims will react with violence,&quot; and said that the cartoon would not have been published if it was intended to be racist or Islamophobic. Zapiro stated that his cartoon was mild and not offensive and in no way similar to the Danish cartoon depicting Muhammad in a negative light. The following week, Zapiro published a cartoon of himself on a psychologists couch off-loading about the difficult week prior, and also saying, &quot;The issue is depicting the prophet... it&#x27;s that simple&quot;, and, &quot;That&#x27;s for adherents of Islam! Why should non-believers be censored? And there&#x27;s the contradiction of all those ancient Iranian and Turkish Muhammad drawings... drawn by devout Muslims!&quot;. Further, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m being linked to that juvenile Islamophobic Facebook campaign. And I&#x27;m sorry if anyone&#x27;s linked me to the Islamophobia of the U.S. &#x27;war on terror&#x27;! ... Or the Burqa and minaret bans in Western Europe!&quot;, and that &quot;making exceptions for religious censorship is hard for a cartoonist&quot;. An editorial piece opposite the cartoon stated that the paper &quot;clearly underestimated the depth of anger ignited by the cartoon, and sincerely regret the sense of injury it caused many Muslims&quot;. Zapiro also noted the irony of being so harshly condemned by Muslims who often supported his pro-Palestinian drawing which angered his fellow Jews. Local clerics stated in a meeting with Zapiro that week that while they support freedom of expression, they do not support drawings of Muhammad.
No violence or protests ensued after the cartoon was published and most local Muslims found it to be mild and some did not find it to be offensive and found the reaction of the council to have been exaggerated.

The Council of Muslim Theologians (Jamiatul Ulama) succeeded in 2006 in preventing the Sunday Times from publishing a controversial cartoon of Muhammad by a Danish cartoonist.

<text>Wickliffe Preston Draper (August 9, 1891 – March 11, 1972) was an American political activist. He was an ardent eugenicist and lifelong advocate of strict racial segregation. In 1937, he founded the Pioneer Fund for eugenics and heredity research; he later became its principal benefactor.

==Early life and education==
Draper was born on August 9, 1891, in Hopedale, Massachusetts. He was the son and heir of Jessie Fremont Preston Draper, daughter of Confederate Brigadier General William Preston III, who had served as the United States Ambassador to Spain, until the American Civil War and George A. Draper, owner of Draper Looms textile and textile machinery manufacturers, who descended from generations of prominent Americans. He attended St. Mark&#x27;s School in Southborough, Massachusetts.

Draper graduated from Harvard University in 1913. When the United States was slow to enter World War I, he enlisted in the British Army. When the U.S. eventually declared war, he transferred to the U.S. Army.

==Postwar==
In 1924, Draper established the Draper Armor Leadership Award, as a means to competitively test the leadership of small Cavalry units in the US Army. The test was oriented to the platoon level of Horse Cavalry. The first Cavalry Leadership Test for small units was held at Fort Riley, Kansas, then home of the Cavalry School. In 1928, Lieutenant Commander Draper established a trust fund of $35,000 to perpetuate the award.

In 1927, he participated in the French mission of Captain Marcel Augiéras to the southern Sahara that discovered the remains of &quot;Asselar man&quot;, an extinct human believed to belong to the Holocene, or Recent Epoch. Some scholars consider it the oldest known skeleton of a black African. The French Société de Géographie subsequently awarded him its 1932 gold medal, the Grande Médaille d&#x27;Or des Explorations, and in Britain, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. After the war, he traveled and went on numerous safaris. His large New York City apartment was reportedly filled with mounted trophies.

==Eugenics and Pioneer Fund==

During this time, Draper became interested in eugenics, which had been a popular movement in the United States during the first three decades of the 20th century. However, by the early 1930s, interest had begun to fade as the underlying science came under question. Groups like the American Eugenics Society (AES) faced declining membership and dwindling treasuries. Draper had helped ease the funding shortfall, making a special gift to the AES of several thousand dollars to support the society prior to 1932.

In August 1935, Draper traveled to Berlin to attend the International Congress for the Scientific Investigation of Population Problems. Presiding over the conference was Wilhelm Frick, the German Minister of the Interior. At the conference, Draper&#x27;s travel companion, Dr. Clarence Campbell delivered an oration that concluded:
&quot;The difference between the Jew and the Aryan is as unsurmountable [sic] as that between black and white... Germany has set a pattern which other nations must follow... To that great leader, Adolf Hitler!&quot;

Three years later, when Draper paid to print and disseminate the book &quot;White America&quot; by Earnest Sevier Cox, an advocate of white supremacy and racial segregation, a personal copy was delivered to Frick.

In 1937, Draper established the Pioneer Fund, a foundation intended to give scholarships to descendants of White American colonial-era families and to support research into &quot;race betterment&quot; through eugenics. The scholarships were never given, but the first project of the fund was to distribute two documentary films from Nazi Germany depicting its claimed success with eugenics. The Pioneer Fund was headed by the sociologist and eugenicist Harry H. Laughlin, an advocate for restrictive immigration laws and national programs of compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and intellectually disabled.

At age 50, Draper again volunteered for military service and was assigned a post with British military intelligence in India during World War II. After the war, he returned to eugenicist and segregationist activism, and The Pioneer Fund supported the work of a number of noted and controversial researchers of race and intelligence, such as the Nobel Laureate William Shockley, the American differential psychologist Arthur Jensen, the Canadian evolutionary psychologist J. Philippe Rushton, and the British anthropologist Roger Pearson. Though he never served as the Pioneer Fund&#x27;s president, Draper remained on its board until his death and left his estate to the Fund. He also donated considerable funds to right-wing political organizations and candidates, including the World Anti-Communist League (WACL), which was later headed by Pearson, who had received extensive funding from The Pioneer Fund and Draper during his career at University of Southern Mississippi.

In addition to the Pioneer Fund, Draper financed the Back to Africa repatriation movement, particularly the work of Earnest Sevier Cox, whose book &quot;White America&quot; he also funded. During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, he secretly sent $255,000 to the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission in 1963 and 1964 to support racial segregation. He also promoted opposition to the desegregation of public schools mandated by the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 decision, Brown v. Board of Education. Those financial contributions came to light in the 1990s, when the Sovereignty Commission&#x27;s records were made public. Doug A. Blackmon of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and Prof. William H. Tucker of Rutgers University discovered the incriminating documents.

==Funding of Mississippi Sovereignty Commission==
Draper was one of the primary out-of-state benefactors of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission (MSC), during 1963 and 1964. MSC attorney John Satterfield identified Draper&#x27;s contributions, totaling over $250,000 as originating from &quot;The Wall Street Gang&quot; from the North. Doug Blackmon of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; uncovered evidence of these contributions via Draper&#x27;s J. P. Morgan trust account and published his results on June 11, 1999 in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

The Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith also received $1,000,000 in the Spring of 1964 to build his &quot;Christ of the Ozarks&quot; shrine and tourist attraction in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Cross and the Flag&quot; periodical advanced and promulgated Draper&#x27;s positions and attitudes for three decades, from 1942 to 1972 when Smith died.

Draper opposed FDR&#x27;s efforts to implement the Social Security Act, expanded child labor laws, and early attempts to pass the equivalent of OSHA-styled regulations. He disliked JFK for currying favor with labor unions, promoting civil rights advances, and failing to pass tariff barriers to prevent the import of foreign textiles and cotton. Draper blamed the actions of both presidents for the demise of the domestic textile industry that eventually caused the Draper Company to be dissolved by Rockwell International as an insolvent entity. Draper converted his equity in The Draper Company into a $100,000,000 windfall investment in Rockwell International preferred stock, when Rockwell expanded because of the Vietnam War.

==Later life==

Considered reclusive, Draper maintained a low profile throughout his life, as did the Pioneer Fund. When Draper died in 1972 from prostate cancer, he bequeathed $1.4 million to the Pioneer Fund.

Draper&#x27;s work has become more controversial since the publication of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994), because the Pioneer Fund financially sponsored much of the research reported in the book. The publication of &quot;The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism&quot; (1994) by Stefan Kühl resulted in further publicity for Draper and the Fund.

<doc id="1274031" wikidata="Q636673" url="?curid=1274031" title="Merovingian script">
<text>Merovingian script or Gallo-Roman script () was a medieval variant of the Latin script so called because it was developed in Gaul during the Merovingian dynasty. It was used in the 7th and 8th centuries before the Carolingian dynasty and the development of Carolingian minuscule.

==Script types==
There were four major centres of Merovingian script: the monasteries of Luxeuil, Laon, Corbie, and Chelles. Each script developed from uncial, half-uncial, and the Merovingian charter scripts.

===Luxeuil===
The Luxeuil type uses distinctive long, slim capital letters as a display script. These capitals have wedge-shaped finials, and the crossbar of ⟨a⟩ resembles a small letter ⟨v⟩ while that of ⟨h⟩ is a wavy line. The letter ⟨o⟩ is often written as a diamond shape, with a smaller ⟨o⟩ written inside. The letter ⟨a⟩ resembles two ⟨c⟩s (&quot;cc&quot;), and because of this distinctive feature the Luxeuil type is sometimes called &quot;a type&quot;. The letter ⟨b⟩ often has an open bowl and an arm connecting it to the following letter, the letter ⟨d⟩ can have either a vertical ascender or an ascender slanted to the left; ⟨i⟩ is often very tall, resembling l; ⟨n⟩ can be written with an uncial form (similar to a capital ⟨N⟩); ⟨o⟩ is often drop-shaped and has a line connecting it to the next letter; and ⟨t⟩ has a loop extending to the left of its top stroke. The letter ⟨t⟩ is also used in numerous ligatures where it has many other forms. The letters ⟨e⟩ and ⟨r⟩ are also quite often found in ligature.

===Laon===
The Laon type has thicker display capitals than the Luxeuil type. Capital initial letters are often decorated with animals, and there are many ligatures with the letter ⟨i⟩. Like Visigothic script, there are two different ⟨ti⟩ ligatures, representing two different sounds (&quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot;). The letters ⟨d⟩ and ⟨q⟩ often have open bowls. The letter a is unique, resembling two sharp points (&quot;«&quot;), and the letter ⟨z⟩, uncommon in Latin, is nevertheless very distinctive in the Laon type, with a flourish projecting upwards to the left, above the line. Because of these features, Laon type is sometimes called &quot;a-z type&quot;.

===Corbie===
The Corbie type as used in the 8th century, was based on uncial and the Luxeuil type, but was also similar to half-uncial and insular script, with elements of Roman cursive. It is sometimes called &quot;eN-type&quot;, as the letter ⟨e⟩ has a high, open upper loop, and the uncial form of the letter ⟨n⟩ (resembling majuscule ⟨N⟩) is very frequently used. After the mid-8th century, the letter (a) also has an open loop and resembles the letter ⟨u⟩; this type is referred to as &quot;eNa-type&quot;. A more distinctive type was developed at Corbie in the 9th century, the &quot;a-b type&quot;. The letter ⟨b⟩ is similar to Luxeuil type, but the letter ⟨a⟩ has a straight first stroke, resembling a combination of ⟨i⟩ and ⟨c⟩. This type was used from the end of the 8th century until the mid-9th century. The Liber glossarum, a major medieval reference work, was written in the &quot;a-b type&quot; script of Corbie.

===Chelles===
The Chelles type was similar to the Luxeuil a-b type. Other features include the uncial ⟨N⟩, with strokes leaning to the left; the letter d with an ascender leaning to the left; the letter ⟨g⟩ with a descender resembling the letter ⟨s⟩; the letter ⟨s⟩ with a very small top loop; and the letter ⟨x⟩ with the two strokes crossing near the top of the line rather than the middle.

==Development==
There was also a Merovingian cursive script, used in charters and non-religious writings. All of these types were later influenced by Carolingian script, which eventually replaced it entirely. Along with resemblances to Carolingian and Visigothic, Merovingian shares some features with Beneventan script.

<doc id="1274033" wikidata="Q3471224" url="?curid=1274033" title="Samuel Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys">
<text>Samuel Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys (10 August 1695 – 21 April 1770) was an English Whig politician and peer who represented Worcester in the British House of Commons from 1718 until 1743 when he was created Baron Sandys. He held numerous posts in the government of the United Kingdom, namely Chancellor of the Exchequer, Leader of the House of Commons, Cofferer of the Household and First Lord of Trade. He was also a justice in eyre.

==Early life==
Sandys was the eldest son of Edwin Sandys (himself a descendant of Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York), and his wife Alice, daughter of Sir James Rushout .

He was educated at New College, Oxford, matriculating in 1711 aged 16. He left Oxford in 1715 without graduating, and embarked on a Grand Tour of Continental Europe.

==Opposition==
In 1718, at the age of 22, Sandys was elected MP for Worcester, as a Whig. He represented the seat for 25 years.

Initially a supporter of Robert Walpole&#x27;s government, in 1725 Sandys and his uncle Sir John Rushout went into opposition with William Pulteney. Sandys was seen as second-in-command to Pulteney, the leader of the Patriot Whigs.

In February 1730 Sandys introduced the Pension Bill, to bar from sitting in the House of Commons anyone with any pensions or offices held in trust for them from the Crown. The bill passed through the House of Commons but was rejected by the House of Lords; he reintroduced the bill several times in subsequent sessions, with the same result. Sandys opposed the government&#x27;s economic policy: in 1733 he opposed both the motion to take £500,000 from the sinking fund and the Excise Bill to tax tobacco and wine imports; in February 1736 he called attention to the increase of the national debt.

On 13 February 1741, Sandys moved a motion to call upon King George II to dismiss Walpole. The Tories did not support the motion, which was defeated by 290 votes to 106; the Tory Jacobite William Shippen commented of Walpole and the opposition Whigs that &quot;Robin and I are two honest men: he is for King George and I for King James, but those men in long cravats only desire places under either one or the other&quot;.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer==
This impression that senior opposition Whigs were motivated by self-advancement rather than by opposition to the government gained substance when Walpole fell in February 1742. Pulteney (created Earl of Bath that year) brokered a deal with the Court, without consulting opposition parties. The new ministry led by Lord Wilmington was a continuation of Walpole&#x27;s ministry with few personnel changes, but with Sandys appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir John Rushout and Phillips Gybbon appointed Lords of the Treasury.

Pulteney and Sandys supported the appointment of a secret committee to investigate Walpole&#x27;s conduct in office; Sandys was elected a member of the committee. They opposed the repeal of the Septennial Act 1716, and objected to the rejection by the Lords of the Indemnification Bill to recompense witnesses against Walpole. In December 1742 Sandys opposed a Place Bill (to limit the capacity of parliamentarians to hold other paid positions, especially in the military), although he had proposed several such bills when in opposition.

Wilmington died in July 1743, succeeded as First Lord of the Treasury by Henry Pelham. On 12 December 1743, Pelham took the Chancellorship himself.

==Later career==
Sandys was compensated with a peerage, being created Baron Sandys on 20 December 1743, and appointed as Cofferer of the Household. He later held office as Speaker of the House of Lords in the Pitt–Devonshire ministry (November 1756 – July 1757), and as First Lord of Trade under Lords Newcastle and Bute (March 1761 – February 1763).

Sandys died on 21 April 1770, from injuries sustained when his post chaise overturned on Highgate Hill.

==Family==

On 9 June 1725 Sandys married Letitia, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Sir Thomas Tipping and his wife Anne Cheke. They had seven sons and three daughters:

* Edwin Sandys (28 April 1726 – 11 March 1797), MP, succeeded as the 2nd Baron Sandys in 1770
* Cheek Sandys (1727–1737)
* Thomas Sandys (born 30 September 1728, London, died in infancy)
* Martin Sandys (baptised 24 November 1729, Ombersley – 26 December 1768), Colonel, Equerry to the Duke of Cumberland
** Martin&#x27;s daughter Mary (wife of Arthur Hill, 2nd Marquess of Downshire) inherited the Ombersley estates upon the 2nd Baron&#x27;s death in 1797, and was granted a new Sandys barony in 1802.
* Letitia Sandys (baptised 25 August 1731, Ombersley – 10 January 1784)
* William Sandys (baptised 5 August 1732, Ombersley – 31 October 1749)
* Anne Sandys (born 10 January 1734 – 1797) married Christopher Bethell
* John Sandys (baptised 31 October 1735, Ombersley – 1758), soldier, died in Germany
* Katherine Sandys (baptised 25 September 1736, died in infancy)
* Henry Sandys (baptised 4 July 1737, Ombersley, died in infancy)

<text>James King (May 22, 1925November 20, 2005) was an American operatic tenor who had an active international singing career in operas and concerts from the 1950s through 2000. Widely regarded as one of the finest American heldentenors of the post-war period, he excelled in performances of the works of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss.

King made several recordings during his career, most notably singing the role of Siegmund in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; for Sir Georg Solti&#x27;s famous recording of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring Cycle&quot;. He was a member of the voice faculties at the University of Missouri–Kansas City and the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University.

==Biography==
King was born in Dodge City, Kansas, to an Irish father and a mother of German lineage. In his youth he actively sang in church choirs and studied the violin. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music from Louisiana State University in 1949, where he trained to be a baritone with Dallas Draper. He then pursued a master&#x27;s degree in vocal performance from the University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC). He then joined the voice faculty of UMKC, where he taught for nine years and began performing in concerts and operas as a baritone.

In 1956 King came to the personal realization that he was in fact a tenor and not a baritone. He began retraining his voice with French baritone Martial Singher and later German tenor Max Lorenz in order to achieve this goal. In 1960 he began his career as a tenor as a resident artist with the Saint Louis Municipal Opera. His last performance of a baritone role was for his debut with the San Francisco Opera as Escamillo in &quot;Carmen&quot; with Marilyn Horne in the title role in May 1961.

In 1961 King won the American Opera Auditions in Cincinnati, whose prize enabled him to pursue further studies in Italy and make his European opera debut in his first tenor role, Cavaradossi in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; at the Teatro della Pergola. He was soon offered contracts with major European opera houses, including the Deutsche Oper Berlin (1962), the Salzburg Festival (1962), the Vienna State Opera (1963), the Bayreuth Festival (1965), and La Scala (1968).

King made his Metropolitan Opera (Met) debut on January 8, 1966, as Florestan in Fidelio. Over the next 30 years, he sang 113 performances there. His other Met roles included the Emperor in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;; Aegisthus in &quot;Elektra&quot;; Calaf in &quot;Turandot&quot;; Lohengrin; Don Jose in &quot;Carmen&quot;; Erik in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;; Siegmund in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;; Bacchus in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;; Cavaradossi in &quot;Tosca&quot;; Walther in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;; Captain Vere in &quot;Billy Budd&quot;; and the Drum Major in &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. His final appearance was on April 27, 1996, singing Walther in the finale of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; to conclude the James Levine Gala.

Later in life, King was a music and voice professor at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University (IU) from 1984 until his retirement from teaching in 2002. His last performance was in 2000 as Siegmund at IU.

King died on November 20, 2005, of a heart attack in Naples, Florida.

<text>George Edward Kruger Gray (25 December 1880 – 2 May 1943) was an English artist, best remembered for his designs of coinage and stained glass windows.

==Personal life==
Kruger was born in 1880 at 126 Kensington Park Road, London, the son of a Jersey merchant, and was christened George Edward Kruger in Kensington.

He attended Merchant Taylors&#x27; Boys&#x27; School, Crosby and in July 1893 was dramatically rescued from Crosby Beach by Eyton Owen, a schoolmaster of another school, during a tragic incident in which his older brother and their friend, all day boys at Merchant Taylors&#x27;, were drowned.

He received his tertiary education at the Bath School of Art (today Bath School of Art and Design a department of Bath Spa University). There he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London, from which he graduated with a Diploma in Design in his birth name George Edward Kruger. From 1905 he exhibited water colours at the Royal Academy, specialising in landscapes, flower studies and portraits.

During the First World War, Kruger served with the Artists Rifles, and a camouflage unit of the Royal Engineers which specialised in hiding military items and making dummy objects to confuse enemy forces.

In 1918, following his marriage to (Frances) Audrey Gordon Gray, he changed his name to George Kruger Gray. They had a son, Douglas, in October 1920.

After the war, he continued his career as an artist. In 1923, he exhibited his numismatic works at the Royal Academy of Arts, winning a considerable reputation in that area, and become a &#x27;preferred contractor&#x27; for the Royal Mint, designing coins for Great Britain, as well as other parts of the Empire.

In 1938, he became a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE)

Although best known for the design of numismatic items, he also designed and made stained glass windows for churches, universities and the like. As well, he illustrated books, and made posters and cartoons.

Kruger Gray died in Chichester, West Sussex, on 2 May 1943. He is buried in St Mary Churchyard, Fittleworth, Chichester.

==Coinage==
*Kruger Gray designed the Reverse (&quot;Tails&quot;) of most of Australia&#x27;s second set of currency, used from 1937 until the changeover to decimal currency in 1966. This included the halfpenny, penny, threepence, shilling, florin and crown. (The sixpence did not change design.) Additionally, he designed the reverses of the commemorative florins for 1927 and 1935.
*In Canada, he designed the reverse of the one cent (penny) in use from 1937-2012, five cents (nickel) in use from 1937 to the present day, and 50-cent coins in use from 1937 to 1958.
*For Cyprus, he designed the reverse of the 1938–1940 9 piastres and 18 piastres, 1928 45 and 4½ piastres, and 1947–1949 florin.
*For Great Britain he designed the reverse for the 1927–1945 silver threepence, 1927–1948 sixpence, 1927–1936 shilling, both the Scottish and English motifs for the 1937–1948 shilling, 1927–1948 florin, 1927–1948 half crown, 1927–1936 crown (except for the 1935 Jubilee crown), and 1937 crown. The 1927 date was issued only as proof specimens. His designs for the shilling (both designs), florin and half crown were continued from 1949-1952, though do not bear his initials &#x27;KG&#x27; because the inscription had been modified by the omission of &#x27;IND:IMP&#x27; and the layout was therefore modified by another hand.
*For Jersey, he designed the reverse for the 1927–1952 1/12th shilling (the penny) and the 1/24th shilling (the halfpenny).
*For Mauritius, he designed the reverse for the 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents and 10 cents for 1937 to 1978, and the 1/4, 1/2 and 1 rupee of 1934–1978, though some of his designs are still being used in the 21st century.
*For New Guinea, he designed the reverse for the 1936–1944 penny, threepence, sixpence and shilling.
*For New Zealand, he designed the reverse for the threepence (depicting crossed patu), the sixpence (depicting a huia bird), the shilling (depicting a Maori warrior holding a Taiaha), the florin (depicting a kiwi), and the half crown reverse 1933–1965.
*For South Africa, he designed the reverse for the ¼d (farthing), ½d (halfpenny), 1d (penny), threepence, sixpence, shilling, florin, and half crown 1923–1960. Reverse 1961–1964 half, two and half, five, ten and twenty cents.
*For Southern Rhodesia, he designed the reverse side of the 1932–1952 threepence, the 1932–1952 sixpence, the 1932–1952 shilling, the 1932–1954 two shillings, and the 1932–1952 half crown.

==Other works==

Kruger Gray was a well known artisan of his time, and produced a number of coats of arms, including the version used by The University of Western Australia from 1929 to 1963. He also designed the Flag of the Colony of Aden.

He was involved in designing the new Badge for Baronets authorised by Royal Warrant of 10 May 1929.

He designed what became an important distinction given to the Royal Naval Patrol Service in the form of an exclusive silver badge. Officers and men of the Patrol Service were awarded this badge after a total of six months service at sea. It could also be awarded beforehand to those showing worthy conduct while engaged in action. 
Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, 1939 wrote in the following minute:

FIRST LORD to FORTH SEA LORD&lt;br&gt;
I am told that the Minesweepers men have no badge. If this is so it must be remedied at once. I am asking Mr. Bracken to call for designs from Sir Kenneth Clark within one week, after which production must begin with the greatest speed, and distribution as the deliveries come to hand.
The design of the badge measured roughly the size of an old shilling. The design had to symbolise the work of both the minesweeping and the anti-submarine personnel. The finished design took the form of a shield upon which a sinking shark, speared by a marline spike, was set against a background made up of a fishing net with two trapped enemy mines. This was flanked by two examples of the nautical knot and at the top the naval crown. Beneath the badge was a scroll bearing the letters M/S-A/S (Minesweeping Anti-Submarine). A larger version (about 12&quot; high and 7&quot; wide) was also produced, as a painted cast-iron plaque with three screwholes to mount it at an appropriate location on a qualifying vessel.

The shark symbolised a U-boat and the marline spike the tool of the Merchant navy. The net and the mines were both symbols of the fishermen who now found themselves at war seeking a new deadly catch. Never before had one section of the Royal Navy been similarly honoured.

His design for an insignia to denote the award of a &quot;King&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct&quot; was accepted and used for a period from 1943.

In 1940 Gray designed the new George Medal for gallantry based on a bookplate for the Royal Library at Windsor Castle by Stephen Gooden. One of his final works was a very personal piece. His brother Kenneth, a civilian, had died in unknown circumstances in Yokohama Japan in 1942, probably during internment. Gray painted a memorial to him in the format of a stained glass window. If there was a hope to recreate the design in glass, it apparently never happened.

<text>The Tolt River is located in the western foothills of the Cascade Mountains in north central King County in the U.S. state of Washington. The river begins at the confluence of the North Fork Tolt and South Fork Tolt rivers. It flows southwest joining the Snoqualmie River near Carnation, Washington. The Tolt River watershed is part of the larger Snohomish River and Puget Sound drainage basin.

The South Fork Tolt watershed provides ~30% of the drinking water for Seattle area residents.

<text>Henry Crookshank (13 February 1893 – 10 August 1972) was an Irish geologist who worked in the Geological Survey of India serving as its superintendent in 1944-45.

Crookshank was born in Dublin, the second son of Elizabeth née Stokes (1867–1945) and Charles Henry Crookshank (1859-1927). His mother was related to the bacteriologist Adrian Stokes and archaeologist Margaret McNair Stokes. He was educated at St. Columba&#x27;s College and then Trinity College, Dublin where he studied mathematics but World War I interrupted his studies. He joined the Dublin Fusiliers in 1914 and served in the Middle East and France, while his brother Arthur who also served in the war died at Gallipoli. He returned in 1918 to study engineering and joined the Geological Survey of India in 1929. He geological work began with oil surveys near Karachi and later studied sapphires in the Vizag area, and studies in the Satpura Gondwana Basin.

Crookshank served in the Northwest Frontier in the early 1940s but was shot in both legs and flown back to Rawalpindi. After recovering he was posted in charge of mica production in Rajputana.

Crookshank married Eileen &quot;Kitty&quot; Mary Somerville-Lodge in 1921 at Calcutta and they had three daughters including Anne (January 3, 1927 – October 18, 2016) who became a professor of art.

<text>The 1970 Bhola cyclone (also known as the Great Cyclone of 1970) was a catastrophic and extremely deadly tropical cyclone that struck East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) and India&#x27;s West Bengal on 12 November 1970. It remains the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded and one of the world&#x27;s deadliest humanitarian disasters. At least 300,000 people died in the storm, possibly as many as 450,000, primarily as a result of the storm surge that flooded much of the low-lying islands of the Ganges Delta. Bhola was the sixth and strongest cyclonic storm of the 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season.

The cyclone formed over the central Bay of Bengal on 8 November and traveled northward, intensifying as it did so. It reached its peak with winds of on 10 November, and made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan on the following afternoon. The storm surge devastated many of the offshore islands, wiping out villages and destroying crops throughout the region. In the most severely affected upazila Tazumuddin, over 45% of the population of 167,000 were killed by the storm.

The Pakistani government, led by junta leader General Yahya Khan, was criticized for its delayed handling of relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and by the international media. The poor and discriminating response from the West Pakistan government led to the increasingly widespread disillusionment from the East Pakistani people, allowing the opposition Awami League to gain a landslide victory in the province during the election that took place a month later as well as the Bangladesh Liberation War 7 months later.

== Meteorological history ==

On 1 November, Tropical Storm Nora developed over the South China Sea, in the West Pacific Ocean. The system lasted for four days, before degenerating into a remnant low over the Gulf of Thailand on 4 November, and subsequently moved west over the Malay Peninsula the next day. The remnants of this system contributed to the development of a new depression in the central Bay of Bengal on the morning of 8 November. The depression intensified as it moved slowly northward, and the India Meteorological Department upgraded it to a cyclonic storm the next day. No country in the region had ever named tropical cyclones during this time, so no new identity was given. The storm became nearly stationary that evening near 14.5° N, 87° E, but began to accelerate toward the north on 10 November.

The storm further intensified into a severe cyclonic storm on 11 November and began to turn towards the northeast, as it approached the head of the bay. It developed a clear eye and reached its peak intensity later that day, with three-minute sustained winds of , one-minute sustained winds of , and a central pressure of 960 hPa. The cyclone made landfall on the East Pakistan coastline during the evening of 12 November, around the same time as the local high tide. Once over land, the system began to weaken; the storm degraded to a cyclonic storm on 13 November, when it was about south-southeast of Agartala. The storm then rapidly weakened into a remnant low over southern Assam that evening.

== Preparations ==
There is question as to how much of the information about the cyclone said to have been received by Indian weather authorities was transmitted to East Pakistan authorities. This is because the Indian and East Pakistani weather services may not have shared information given the Indo-Pakistani friction at the time. A large part of the population was reportedly taken by surprise by the storm. There were indications that East Pakistan&#x27;s storm warning system was not used properly. The Pakistan Meteorological Department issued a report calling for &quot;danger preparedness&quot; in the vulnerable coastal regions during the day on 12 November. As the storm neared the coast, a &quot;great danger signal&quot; was broadcast on Radio Pakistan. Survivors later said that this meant little to them, but that they had recognised a No. 1 warning signal as representing the greatest possible threat.

Following two previously destructive cyclones in October 1960 which killed at least 16,000 people in East Pakistan, the Pakistani central government contacted the American government for assistance in developing a system to avert future disasters. Gordon Dunn, the director of the National Hurricane Center at the time, carried out a detailed study and submitted his report in 1961. However, the central government did not carry out all of the recommendations Dunn had listed.

== Impact ==
Although the North Indian Ocean is the least active of the tropical cyclone basins, the coast of the Bay of Bengal is particularly vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones. The exact death toll from the Bhola cyclone will never be known, but at least 300,000 fatalities were associated with the storm, possibly as many as 500,000. The cyclone was not, however, the most powerful of these; the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone was significantly stronger when it made landfall in the same general area, as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone with winds.

The Bhola cyclone is the deadliest tropical cyclone on record and also one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history. A comparable number of people died as a result of the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake, but because of uncertainty in the number of deaths in all four disasters, it may never be known which one was the deadliest.

=== Bangladesh ===

The meteorological station in Chittagong, to the east of where the storm made landfall, recorded winds of before its anemometer was blown off at about 2200 UTC on 12 November. A ship anchored in the port in the same area recorded a peak gust of about 45 minutes later. As the storm made landfall, it caused a high storm surge at the Ganges Delta. In the port at Chittagong, the storm tide peaked at about above the average sea level, of which was the storm surge.

Radio Pakistan reported that there were no survivors on the thirteen islands near Chittagong. A flight over the area showed the devastation was complete throughout the southern half of Bhola Island, and the rice crops of Bhola Island, Hatia Island and the nearby mainland coastline were destroyed. Several seagoing vessels in the ports of Chittagong and Mongla were reported damaged, and the airports at Chittagong and Cox&#x27;s Bazar were under of water for several hours.

Over 3.6 million people were directly affected by the cyclone, and the total damage from the storm was estimated at US$86.4 million (US$701 million in 2024). The survivors claimed that approximately 85% of homes in the area were destroyed or severely damaged, with the greatest destruction occurring along the coast. Ninety percent of marine fishermen in the region suffered heavy losses, including the destruction of 9,000 offshore fishing boats. Of the 77,000 onshore fishermen, 46,000 were killed by the cyclone, and 40% of the survivors were affected severely. In total, approximately 65% of the fishing capacity of the coastal region was destroyed by the storm, in a region where about 80% of the protein consumed comes from fish. Agricultural damage was similarly severe with the loss of US$63 million worth of crops and 280,000 cattle. Three months after the storm, 75% of the population was receiving food from relief workers, and over 150,000 relied upon aid for half of their food.

The Bhola Cyclone would also lead to increased cholera and typhoid cases in the region due to the contamination of the water supply in the storm. Many attempts of sending aid to the region were impeded by the prevalent cholera, and as a result, medical aid was delayed.

=== India ===
The cyclone brought widespread rain to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, with very heavy rain falling in places on 89 November. Port Blair recorded of rain on 8 November, and there were a number of floods on the islands. MV &quot;Mahajagmitra&quot;, a 5,500-ton freighter en route from Calcutta to Kuwait, was sunk by the storm on 12 November with the loss of all fifty people on board. The ship sent out a distress signal and reported experiencing hurricane-force winds before it sank. There was also widespread rain in West Bengal and southern Assam. The rain caused damage to housing and crops in both Indian states, with the worst damage occurring in the southernmost districts.

=== Death toll ===
Two medical relief surveys were carried out by the Pakistan-SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory: the first in November and the second in February and March. The purpose of the first survey was to establish the immediate medical needs in the affected regions, and the second, more detailed, survey was designed as the basis for long-term relief and recovery planning. In the second survey, approximately 1.4% of the area&#x27;s population was studied.

The first survey concluded that the surface water in most of the affected regions had a comparable salt content to that drawn from wells, except in Sudharam, where the water was almost undrinkable with a salt content of up to 0.5%. The mortality was estimated at 14.2%—equivalent to a death toll of 240,000. Cyclone-related morbidity was generally restricted to minor injuries, but a phenomenon dubbed &quot;cyclone syndrome&quot; was observed. This consisted of severe abrasions on the limbs and chest caused by survivors clinging to trees to withstand the storm surge. Initially, there were fears of an outbreak of cholera and typhoid fever in the weeks following the storm, but the survey found no evidence of an epidemic of cholera, smallpox, or any other disease in the region affected by the storm.

The totals from the second survey were likely a considerable underestimate as several groups were not included— 100,000 migrant workers who were collecting the rice harvest, families who were completely wiped out by the storm, and those who had migrated out of the region in the intervening three months. Excluding these groups reduced the risk of hearsay and exaggeration. The survey concluded that the overall death toll was, at minimum, 224,000. The worst effects were felt in Tazumuddin, where the mortality was 46.3%, corresponding to approximately 80,000 deaths in the thana alone. The mean mortality throughout the affected region was 16.5%.

The results showed that the highest survival rate was for adult males aged 15–49, while more than half the deaths were children under age 10, who only formed a third of the pre-cyclone population. This suggests that the young, old, and sick were at the highest risk of perishing in the cyclone and its storm surge. In the months after the storm, the mortality of the middle-aged was lower in the cyclone area than in the control region, near Dhaka. This reflected the storm&#x27;s toll on the less healthy individuals.

== Aftermath ==
=== Government response ===
The days after the storm struck the coast, three Pakistanis gunboat and a hospital ship carrying medical personnel and supplies left Chittagong for the islands of Hatiya, Sandwip and Kutubdia. Teams from the Pakistani Army reached many of the stricken areas in the two days following the landfall of the cyclone. President Khan visited East Pakistan on the way back from a trip to China. In a press conference in Dhaka, Khan accepted the government had made &quot;slips&quot; and &quot;mistakes&quot; in their relief effort for the cyclone victims of then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) but he insisted that &quot;everything was done within the limits of the Government.&quot; He then returned to Rawalpindi. No West Pakistani political leaders visited the East.

In the ten and a half days following the cyclone, one military transport aircraft and three crop-dusting aircraft were assigned to relief work by the Pakistani central government. The central government said it was unable to transfer military helicopters from West Pakistan as the Indian government did not grant clearance to cross the intervening Indian territory, a charge the Indian government denied. By 24 November, the central government had allocated a further US$116 million to finance relief operations in the disaster area. Khan arrived in Dhaka to take charge of the relief operations on 24 November. The governor of East Pakistan, Vice Admiral S. M. Ahsan, denied charges that the armed forces had not acted quickly enough and said supplies were reaching all parts of the disaster area except for some small pockets.

Khan said there was a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the disaster. He also said that the 1970 general election slated for 7 December would take place on time, although eight or nine of the worst affected districts might experience delays, denying rumours that the election would be postponed.

As the conflict between East and West Pakistan developed in March 1971, the Dhaka offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed for at least two weeks, first by a general strike and then by a ban on government work in East Pakistan by the Awami League. Relief work continued in the field, but the long-term planning was curtailed.

=== Criticism of government response ===

Political leaders in East Pakistan were deeply critical of the central government&#x27;s initial response to the disaster. A statement released by eleven East Pakistan politicians ten days after the storm charged the government with &quot;gross neglect, callous indifference and utter indifference&quot;. They also accused President Khan of playing down the news coverage. On November 19, students held a march in Dhaka in protest of the speed of the government response, and Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani addressed a rally of 50,000 people on 24 November, when he accused the president of inefficiency and demanded his resignation. Khan&#x27;s political opponents in West Pakistan accused him of bungling the efforts and some demanded his resignation. Awami League leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman described the destruction caused by the cyclone akin to a &quot;Holocaust&quot; and condemned the military junta&#x27;s response as &quot;criminal negligence&quot;.

The Pakistan Red Crescent began to operate independently of the central government as the result of a dispute that arose after the Red Crescent took possession of twenty rafts donated by the British Red Cross. A pesticide company had to wait two days before it received permission for two of its crop dusters, which were already in the country, to carry out supply drops in the affected regions. The central government only deployed a single helicopter to relief operations, with Khan later stating that there was no point deploying any helicopters from West Pakistan as they were unable to carry supplies.

A reporter for the &quot;Pakistan Observer&quot; spent a week in the worst hit areas in early January 1971 and saw none of the tents supplied by relief agencies being used to house survivors and commented that the grants for building new houses were insufficient. The &quot;Observer&quot; regularly carried front-page stories with headlines like, &quot;No Relief Coordination&quot;, while publishing government statements saying, &quot;Relief operations are going smoothly.&quot; In January, the coldest period of the year in East Pakistan, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, headed by the editor of &quot;Ittefaq&quot;, said thousands of survivors from the storm were &quot;passing their days under [the] open sky&quot;. A spokesman said families who were made homeless by the cyclone were receiving up to 250 rupees (US$55 in 1971; ) to rebuild, but that resources were scarce and he feared the survivors would &quot;eat the cash&quot;.

=== Political consequences ===
Due to the poor handling and the destructive aftermath of the Bhola Cyclone, leftist parties in both East and West Pakistan boycotted the 1970 Pakistani general election. This allowed the Awami League, headed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to win in a landslide victory. The elections for nine national assembly and eighteen provincial assembly seats had to be postponed until January 18 as a result of the storm.

The central government&#x27;s handling of the relief efforts helped exacerbate the bitterness felt in East Pakistan, swelling the resistance movement there. Funds only slowly got through, and transport was slow in bringing supplies to the devastated regions. As tensions increased in March 1971, foreign personnel evacuated because of fears of violence. The situation deteriorated further and evolved into the subsequent genocide.

=== International response ===
India became one of the first nations to offer aid to Pakistan, despite the generally poor relations between the two countries, and by the end of November had pledged US$1.3 million (US$8.7 million in 2020 dollars) of assistance for the relief efforts. The Pakistani central government refused to allow the Indians to send supplies into East Pakistan by air, forcing them to be transported slowly by road instead. The Indian government also said that the Pakistanis refused an offer of military aircraft, helicopters and boats from West Bengal to assist in the relief operation.

U.S. President Richard Nixon allocated a $10 million ($ million in ) grant to provide food and other essential relief to the survivors of the storm, and the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan pledged that he would &quot;assist the East Pakistan government in every way feasible.&quot; The U.S. sent a number of blankets, tents and other supplies to East Pakistan. Six helicopters two helicopters at an aid mission in Nepal and four from the U.S. were also sent. Some 200,000 tons of wheat were shipped from the U.S. to the stricken region. By the end of November, there were 38 helicopters operating in the disaster area, ten of which were British and ten American. The Americans had provided about fifty small boats and the British seventy for supply distribution.

CARE halted aid shipments to East Pakistan the week after the cyclone hit because of unwillingness to let the Pakistani central government handle distribution. However, by January 1971, they had reached an agreement to construct 24,000 cement brick houses at a cost of about $1.2 million ($ million in ). American concerns about delays by the central government in determining how the relief should be used meant that US$7.5 million ($ million in ) of relief granted by the United States Congress had not been handed over in March. Much of the money was earmarked to be spent on constructing cyclone shelters and rebuilding housing. The American Peace Corps offered to send volunteers but were rebuffed by the central government.

A Royal Navy task force, centred on and , left Singapore for the Bay of Bengal to assist with the relief efforts. They carried eight helicopters and eight landing craft, as well as rescue teams and supplies. Fifty soldiers and two helicopters were flown in ahead of the ships to survey the disaster area and bring relief work. The task force arrived off the East Pakistan coast on 24 November, and the 650 troops aboard the ships immediately began using landing craft to deliver supplies to offshore islands. An appeal by the British Disasters Emergency Committee raised about £1.5 million (£ million in ) for disaster relief in East Pakistan.

The Canadian government pledged C$2 million of assistance. France and West Germany both sent helicopters and various supplies worth US$1.3 million. Pope Paul VI announced that he would visit Dhaka during a visit to the Far East and urged people to pray for the victims of the disaster. The Vatican later contributed US$100,000 to the relief efforts. By the start of 1971, four Soviet helicopters were still operating in the region transporting essential supplies to hard-hit areas. The Soviet aircraft, which had drawn criticism from Bengalis, replaced the British and American helicopters that had operated immediately after the cyclone.

The government of Singapore sent a military medical mission to East Pakistan which arrived at Chittagong on 1 December. They were then deployed to Sandwip where they treated nearly 27,000 people and carried out a smallpox vaccination effort. The mission returned to Singapore on 22 December, after bringing about $50,000 worth of medical supplies and fifteen tons of food for the victims of the storm. The Japanese cabinet approved a total of US$1.65 million of relief funds in December. The Japanese government had previously drawn criticism for only donating a small amount to relief work. The first shipment of Chinese supplies was a planeload of 500,000 doses of cholera vaccine, which was not necessary as the country had adequate stocks. The Chinese government sent US$1.2 million in cash to Pakistan. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi declared that the disaster was also an Iranian one and responded by sending two planeloads of supplies within a few days of the cyclone striking. Many smaller, poorer Asian nations sent nominal amounts of aid.

The United Nations donated US$2.1 million in food and cash, while UNICEF began a drive to raise a further million. UNICEF helped to re-establish water supplies in the wake of the storm, repairing over 11,000 wells in the months following the storm. UN Secretary-General U Thant made appeals for aid for the victims of the cyclone and the civil war in August, in two separate relief programs. He said only about $4 million had been contributed towards immediate needs, well short of the target of US$29.2 million. By the end of November, the League of Red Cross Societies had collected US$3.5 million to supply aid to the victims of the disaster.

The World Bank estimated that it would cost US$185 million to reconstruct the area devastated by the storm. The bank drew up a comprehensive recovery plan for the Pakistani government. The plan included restoring housing, water supplies and infrastructure to their pre-storm state. It was designed to combine with a much larger ongoing flood-control and development program. The bank provided US$25 million of credit to help rebuild the East Pakistan economy and to construct protective shelters in the region. This was the first time that the IDA had provided credit for reconstruction. By the start of December, nearly US$40 million had been raised for the relief efforts by the governments of 41 countries, organizations and private groups.

==== The Concert for Bangladesh ====
In 1971, ex-Beatle George Harrison and musician Ravi Shankar were inspired to organize The Concert for Bangladesh, in part from the Bhola cyclone, and from the civil war and genocide. Although it was the first benefit concert of its type, it was extremely successful in raising money, aid and awareness for the region&#x27;s plight.

=== Post-disaster ===
In December 1970, the League of Red Cross Societies drafted a plan for immediate use should a comparable event to the cyclone hit other &quot;disaster prone countries&quot;. A Red Cross official stated some of the relief workers sent to East Pakistan were poorly trained, and the organisation would compile a list of specialists. The UN General Assembly adopted a proposal to improve its ability to provide aid to disaster-stricken countries.

In 1966, the Red Crescent had begun to support the development of a cyclone warning system, which developed into a Cyclone Preparedness Programme in 1972, today run by the government of Bangladesh and the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society. The programme&#x27;s objectives are to raise public awareness of the risks of cyclones and to provide training to emergency personnel in the coastal regions of Bangladesh.

In the thirty years after the 1970 cyclone, over 200 cyclone shelters were constructed in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. When the next destructive cyclone approached the country in 1991, volunteers from the Cyclone Preparedness Programme warned people of the cyclone two to three days before it struck land. Over 350,000 people fled their homes to shelters and other brick structures, while others sought high ground. While the 1991 cyclone killed over 138,000 people, this was significantly less than the 1970 storm, partly because of the warnings sent out by the Cyclone Preparedness Programme. However, the 1991 storm was significantly more destructive, causing billion (equivalent to $billion in ) compared to the 1970 storm&#x27;s $0.086billion (equivalent to $billion in ).

Footage of the incident appeared in the film &quot;Days of Fury&quot; (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price.
