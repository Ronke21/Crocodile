<text>Diego José Pedro Víctor Portales y Palazuelos (; June 16, 1793 – June 6, 1837) was a Chilean statesman and entrepreneur. As a minister of president José Joaquín Prieto&#x27;s government, he played a pivotal role in shaping the state and politics in the 19th century, delivering with the Constitution of 1833 the framework of the Chilean state for almost a century. Portales&#x27; influential political policies included unitarianism, presidentialism and conservatism which led to the consolidation of Chile as a constitutional, authoritarian and aristocratic republic with the franchise restricted to upper class men from the gentry.

While deeply unpopular during his lifetime, his murder in 1837, during a mutiny, has been judged a decisive factor during the War of the Confederation. Chilean public opinion shifted to support the war against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. Many Chileans and historians view him as the power behind the throne of the early republic era, particularly in his shaping the Constitution of 1833. While he never assumed the presidency, his influence permitted him to serve simultaneously as the Minister of War, Minister of the Interior and Minister of Foreign Relations. He was an early proponent of Chilean expansionism.

==Early life==
Diego Portales was born in Santiago, the son of María Encarnación Fernández de Palazuelos y Martínez de Aldunate and José Santiago Portales y Larraín, a superintendent of the royal mint. He did his primary studies at the Colegio de Santiago, and in 1813, attended law classes at the National Institute. As the men of his family had all become successful merchants, Portales also eventually assumed the position of a merchant, taking part in his prosperous and distinguished family&#x27;s occupation.

On August 15, 1819 he married his cousin, Josefa Portales y Larraín. He had two daughters with her, both of whom died within days of their birth. His wife also died soon after in 1821. He never remarried, but took Constanza Nordenflicht as his mistress, with whom he had three children.

In July 1821, he resigned from his job at the Mint and went into business. He opened a trading house, &quot;Portales, Cea and Co.&quot;, based in Valparaiso with a branch in Lima, Peru. He bid and obtained management of the government monopoly on tobacco, tea, and liquor (known in Spanish as &quot;estanco&quot;). In exchange for the monopoly, he offered to service in full Chile&#x27;s foreign debt. Nonetheless, in the anarchy that was regnant in Chile at the time, there was no means of enforcing a monopoly as the government could not regulate sales of tobacco, tea, and liquor, and the company eventually went bankrupt. His contract with the government was voided and the Chilean government was found to owe Portales 87,000 pesos. Out of this unsuccessful business venture, the only remnant was the name eventually applied to his political followers, who in time came to be known as the &quot;estanqueros&quot; (monopolists).

==Political career==
Soon after, he aligned with the conservatives in the political fights that were wracking Chile at the time. As aforementioned, in 1824, Portales’ business firm acquired control over the government&#x27;s monopoly of tobacco, tea, and liquor; however, the country&#x27;s troubled conditions soon thwarted his profitable business. For these reasons, Portales finally entered into the political sphere, and very soon he would become the intellectual leader of the conservative side. He helped to reorganize the conservative party, and, in 1827, founded El Hambriento (or The Starveling), a journal attacking liberal idealists known as the pipiolos (“white beaks”) from Portales&#x27; party&#x27;s (a.k.a. the pelucones or &quot;big wigs&quot;) perspective. Portales was an effective satirist, contributing several popular articles to The Starveling. Portales&#x27; articles placed him in the limelight and paved the way for his political career.
After the triumph of the conservatives in the Revolution of 1829, President José Tomás Ovalle y Bezanilla named him Minister of the Interior and Foreign Affairs on April 6, 1830 remaining until May 1831. He was named again to that position by President Fernando Errázuriz Aldunate on July 9, 1831 and remained until August 31, 1831 and named once again by President José Joaquín Prieto from November 9, 1835 to January 1837. Something similar happened with his nomination as minister of war and navy from April 6, 1830 until May 1831; then from July 9, 1831 until December 1832 and from September 21, 1835 to September 1836.

Though Portales was never president officially (and in fact he deliberately avoided this position for fear of being tied up by factional promises), he became a dictator and with this powerful position, he quelled anarchy. Portales set up a civil militia (which ended one of the worst stages of militarism in Chile&#x27;s history); supported an oligarchic control for landowners, miners, and merchants; and made Catholicism the state religion. As a result of his campaign for peace, order, and thus progress, business also improved.

===Political philosophy===

In 1822, before his rise to power Portales wrote to a friend:Politics doesn&#x27;t interest me, but as a good citizen I feel free to express my opinions and to censure the government. Democracy, which is so loudly proclaimed by the deluded is an absurdity in our countries, flooded as they are with vices and with their citizens lacking all sense of civic virtue, the prerequisite to establishing a real Republic. But monarchy is not the American ideal either; if we get out of one terrible government just to jump headlong into another, what will we have gained? The Republican system is the one which we must adopt, but do you know how I interpret it for our countries? A strong central government whose representatives will be men of true virtue and patriotism, and who thus can direct the citizens along the path of order and progress. These words are demonstrative of the skepticism in pure democracies that the recently failed French revolution impressed upon many. Portales believed that to avoid disaster it was most important to create a stable and functioning government, rather than one ruled by lofty but ultimately impractical ideals. He believed in a peaceful but strong central government, and that in order to successfully run a state or country, citizens must be virtuous and patriotic

==Assassination==

In order to bolster its standing, the Chilean government immediately imposed martial law and asked for (and obtained) extraordinary legislative powers from Congress. Early in 1837 a Court Martial Law was approved and given jurisdiction over all citizens for the duration of the war. The opposition to the Prieto Vial administration immediately accused Portales of tyranny, and started a heated press campaign against him personally and the unpopular war in general.

Political and public opposition to war immediately affected the army, fresh from the purges of the civil war of 1830. On June 3, 1837, Colonel José Antonio Vidaurre, commander of the &quot;Maipo&quot; regiment, captured and imprisoned Portales while he was reviewing troops at the army barracks in Quillota. Vidaurre immediately proceeded to attack Valparaíso on the mistaken belief that public opinion opposed to the war would support him and topple the government. Rear Admiral Manuel Blanco Encalada, in charge of the defense, defeated him right outside the port at the Battle of Barón. Captain Santiago Florín, who was in charge of Portales, had him shot when he heard of the news, on June 6, 1837. Most of the conspirators were subsequently captured and executed.

This murder turned the tide of Chilean public opinion. The government derogated Martial law and the country rallied behind the government. The war became a holy cause, and Portales a martyr.

==Legacy==
Portales&#x27; reign helped to pick up business and accelerate the growth of the economy. Those who particularly benefited from his conservative rule were the already rich. Additionally, Portales helped Chile maintain a good deal of stability relative to many of the other Latin American nations. This was accomplished by Portales&#x27; improvement and renewal of the administration of the State, his strategic vision of Chile as an independent sovereign nation, and his influence upon the Chilean Constitution of 1833, which is considered the most important milestone of Chilean institutionality during the 19th century. His ideals and principles served as a foundation towards the Chilean governments of the future. His work was especially influential during the years of political learning of the post-independence turmoil and during the governments of the Conservative Republic (1830–1861) and to a lesser degree the governments of the Liberal Republic (1861–1891).


The figure and legacy of Portales has been praised by some historians like and Alberto Edwards. Other historians, including Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna, Sergio Villalobos and Gabriel Salazar, have a negative view of Portales.

==Remains==

Portales&#x27; remains, missing since his assassination, were found in March 2005 in Santiago&#x27;s Metropolitan Cathedral during renovation projects, and were identified after forensic examination. On June 20, 2006, the remains were taken to the civic crypt of the Cathedral for a civic-religious re-burial ceremony attended by then-President Michelle Bachelet, along with several civil and military authorities.

<text>Before the 1980s, the Maldives received limited assistance from UN specialized agencies. Much of the external help came from Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE, for use on an ad hoc basis rather than as part of comprehensive development plan. However, with the developmental commitment of President Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom, who assumed office in 1978, Maldives received an annual average of US$15.5 million in external assistance in the form of grants and loans from SAARC to Maldives. 

In 1992, Maldives received approximately US$11.6 million in foreign aid from international agencies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and individual countries, particularly Japan. Other than humanitarian aid, loans and grants went for such purposes as education, health, transport, fisheries, and harbour development. The Maldives currently owes more than 35% of its debt to Chinese investors. The challenge with the Maldives&#x27; outlook is that it is developing too much too quickly, and the small island nation is vulnerable to China&#x27;s formidable financial power. There is lack of economic capacity to compete.

The United Nations Development Programme is providing support to the Maldives for environmental projects.

<text>Jean Auguste Ulric Scheler (1819–1890), also styled Auguste Scheler was a Belgian philologist.

==Biography==
He was born at Ebnat, Switzerland. His father, a German, was chaplain to King Leopold I of Belgium, and Jean Scheler, after studying at Bonn and Munich, became King&#x27;s librarian, and professor at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles. His investigations in Romance philology earned him a wide reputation. He died at Ixelles, Belgium, in 1890.

==Works==
The most important of his numerous philological works are:
*&quot;Mémoire sur la conjugaison française considérée sous le rapport étymologique&quot; (Brussels, 1847)
*&quot;Dictionnaire d&#x27;étymologie française d&#x27;après les résultats de la science moderne&quot; (Brussels, 1862)
*&quot;Étude sur la transformation française des mots latins&quot; (Ghent, 1869)
He also edited the fourth edition of Diez&#x27;s &quot;Etymologisches Wörterbuch der romanischen Sprachen&quot; (Bonn, 1878), and completed Grandgagnage&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue wallonne&quot; (Louvain, 1880). He also published several critical editions of Middle Ages texts, including one of &quot;Les Poésies de Froissart&quot; (Brussels, 1870–1872), and a monograph &quot;Sur le séjour de l&#x27;apôtre saint Pierre a Rome&quot; (Brussels, 1845), which was translated into German and English.
He contributed to the 1876 &quot;Annales de L’Académie d’Archéologie de Belgique&quot; with an article titled &quot;Deux Redactions Diverses de la Legende de Sainte Marguerite en vers Français&quot;.

<doc id="1267175" wikidata="Q518553" url="?curid=1267175" title="Eurodistrict">
<text>A eurodistrict is a European administrative entity that contains urban agglomerations which lie across the border between two or more states. A eurodistrict offers a program for cooperation and integration of the towns or communes which it comprises: for example, improving transport links for people who live and work on different sides of the border.

The first Eurodistricts created or currently undergoing creation are:
* Strasbourg-Ortenau
* Freiburg im Breisgau-Centre et Sud Alsace (i.e. Haut-Rhin)
* Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai (Eurometropolis)
* Saar-Moselle
* Trinational Eurodistrict of Basel
* Øresund Region also known as &quot;Greater Copenhagen and Skåne Region&quot;

They may be established:
* by a simple agreement about common projects in the area;
* in a more institutionalised manner by a local association for transfrontier or cross-border cooperation (in French: &quot;groupement local de coopération transfrontalière&quot; or &quot;GLCT&quot;), which can draw up plans for transfrontier cooperation between towns or communes; or
* with an even greater degree of institutionalisation, perhaps including structures allowing a transfer of power and elected by all district citizens. This has constitutional implications for the individual countries involved, which have to be taken into account when drawing up agreements.

Note that transfrontier cooperation methods between regions known as euroregions exist in parallel to eurodistricts, which are generally urban. Furthermore, a eurodistrict can be located within a euroregion and even have certain connections with it.

The term &quot;eurodistrict&quot; is quite new (text written 2006) and has not been defined by organisations like the Council of Europe or the European Union.

An important reason to introduce the Schengen Agreement is to simplify work commuting within such border crossing built-up areas.

<text>The [[Mazda]] 767/767B are prototype racing cars that were built by Mazdaspeed for the 24 Hours of Le Mans running under the IMSA-spec GTP class. The 767 replaced the 757 in 1988, upgrading to a newer and larger 4-rotor &quot;13J&quot; Wankel engine which produced nearly .

Two 767s were entered at 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing 17th and 19th overall, however they finished behind a sole 757 which was able to finish 15th. In the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, Mazda managed 4th in the constructors&#x27; championship. For 1989, Mazda upgraded the 767 into the 767B, and initially tested it in the IMSA 24 Hours of Daytona, where it was successful in finishing 5th overall. Later in the year, Mazda returned to Le Mans with two 767Bs as well as an older 767. The 767Bs were able to finish 7th and 9th overall, while the lone 767 was able to finish 12th. However, in JSPC, the results were not as promising, as Mazda finished a mere 5th in the championship. For 1990, a single 767B was entered alongside two newer 787s, and was the only car of the three to finish, although in 20th overall.

<text>Vicky Pope is a scientist and the former head of the climate predictions programme at the Hadley Centre. 

== Biography ==
Pope attended North London Collegiate School. She joined the Met Office in the 1980s and went on to complete a PhD in Meteorology at the University of Reading. 

She spent 6 years as manager of atmospheric climate model development and evaluation. She became a senior manager of the climate research programme for a number of UK Government departments in 2002. Since October 2004 she was Head of the Climate Prediction Programme which provides independent scientific advice on climate change. Her research interests include developing and validating climate models.

She is a professor at Gresham College, and an honorary professor at University College London.

In an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, she wrote:&quot; &quot;Having to rein in extraordinary claims that the latest extreme event is all due to climate change is at best hugely frustrating and at worse enormously distracting. Overplaying natural variations in the weather as climate change is just as much a distortion of science as underplaying them to claim that climate change has stopped or is not happening.&quot;&quot;

She added: &quot;Both undermine the basic facts that the implications of climate change are profound and will be severe if greenhouse gas emissions are not cut drastically.&quot;

<text>The [[Mazda]] 757 is a prototype racing car built by Mazdaspeed for the 24 Hours of Le Mans running under the IMSA-spec GTP class. It replaced the previous lineage of Group C2 class cars which ended with the 737C and was the first chassis built entirely by Mazdaspeed and designed by Nigel Stroud. The 747 designation was skipped to avoid confusion with the second generation Mazda RX-7, which was developed under the codename P747. The 757 used a new 3-rotor &quot;13G&quot; Wankel engine.

Two 757s entered the 1986 24 Hours of Le Mans, but both failed to finish the race due to gearbox problems, marking the first time Mazdaspeed had failed to finish at Le Mans. In the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship season, Mazda was able to come home 3rd in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship. For 1987, two 757s were again entered, with one finishing 7th overall while the other suffered engine failure. Along with a good result at the joint World Sportscar Championship and All Japan Sports Prototype Championship event at Fuji, Mazdaspeed was able to achieve 10th in the teams championship for WSC and 3rd in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship for JSPC. A lone 757 was brought out again for 1988 alongside two newer 767s and was able to beat both 767s to place 15th overall.

<text>Coat is the nature and quality of a mammal&#x27;s fur. In the animal fancy, coat is an attribute that reflects the quality of a specimen&#x27;s breeding as well as the level of the animal&#x27;s care, conditioning, and management. Coat is an integral aspect of the judging at competitions such as a conformation dog show, a cat show, a horse show (especially showmanship classes), or a rabbit show.

The pelage of a show animal may be divided into different types of hair, fur or wool with a texture ranging from downy to spiky. In addition, the animal may be single-coated or may have a number of coats, such as an undercoat and a topcoat (also called an &quot;outer coat&quot; or, sometimes, &quot;overcoat&quot;), which is made up of guard hair. The state of the coat is considered an indication of the animal&#x27;s breeding and health.

Animals might have different coat quality for different seasons. Normally, animals with fur or hair body coats may develop a thicker and/or longer winter coat in colder times of the year, which will shed out to a shorter, sleeker, summer coat as the days lengthen into spring and summer. This process may not occur in a noticeable fashion in climates that are warm year-round, though animals may nonetheless shed their coats periodically. The process may also be minimized by artificially keeping the animal blanketed, or, in the case of small animals, housed indoors.

Pinnipeds and polar bears have longer guard hairs forming the most visible fur; polar bears&#x27; guard hairs are hollow.

Some considerations in judging the quality of an animal&#x27;s coat:

*Colour (coat colour other than those allowed in the breed standard results in disqualification)
*Markings (distribution of colour, spots, and patches; for example the spotted coat of a Dalmatian and the merle coat of an Australian Shepherd are distinctive; the markings of a terrier vary.)
*Pattern (specific, predictable markings; tabby, for example is a common pattern in cats)
*Texture of hair (smooth, rough, curly, straight, broken)
*Length of hair
*Health of hair coat (shiny or dull, brittle or flexible, etc.)

<doc id="1267216" wikidata="Q1077480" url="?curid=1267216" title="Hypervisor">
<text>A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) or virtualizer, is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a &quot;host machine&quot;, and each virtual machine is called a &quot;guest machine&quot;. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Unlike an emulator, the guest executes most instructions on the native hardware. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-system–level virtualization, where all instances (usually called &quot;containers&quot;) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel.

The term &quot;hypervisor&quot; is a variant of &quot;supervisor&quot;, a traditional term for the kernel of an operating system: the hypervisor is the supervisor of the supervisors, with &quot;&quot; used as a stronger variant of &quot;&quot;. The term dates to circa 1970; IBM coined it for software that ran OS/360 and the 7090 emulator concurrently on the 360/65 and later used it for the DIAG handler of CP-67. In the earlier CP/CMS (1967) system, the term &quot;Control Program&quot; was used instead.

Some literature, especially in microkernel contexts, makes a distinction between &quot;hypervisor&quot; and &quot;virtual machine monitor&quot; (VMM). There, both components form the overall &quot;virtualization stack&quot; of a certain system. &quot;Hypervisor&quot; refers to kernel-space functionality and VMM to user-space functionality. Specifically in these contexts, a &quot;hypervisor&quot; is a microkernel implementing virtualization infrastructure that must run in kernel-space for technical reasons, such as Intel VMX. Microkernels implementing virtualization mechanisms are also referred to as &quot;microhypervisor&quot;. Applying this terminology to Linux, KVM is a &quot;hypervisor&quot; and QEMU or Cloud Hypervisor are VMMs utilizing KVM as hypervisor. 

== Classification ==
In his 1973 thesis, &quot;Architectural Principles for Virtual Computer Systems,&quot; Robert P. Goldberg classified two types of hypervisor:

; Type-1, native or bare-metal hypervisors
: These hypervisors run directly on the host&#x27;s hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest operating systems. For this reason, they are sometimes called bare-metal hypervisors. The first hypervisors, which IBM developed in the 1960s, were native hypervisors. These included the test software SIMMON and the CP/CMS operating system, the predecessor of IBM&#x27;s VM family of virtual machine operating systems. Examples of Type-1 hypervisor include Hyper-V, Xen and VMware ESXi. 
; Type-2 or hosted hypervisors
: These hypervisors run on a conventional operating system (OS) just as other computer programs do. A virtual machine monitor runs as a process on the host, such as VirtualBox. Type-2 hypervisors abstract guest operating systems from the host operating system, effectively creating an isolated system that can be interacted with by the host. Examples of Type-2 hypervisor include VirtualBox and VMware Workstation.

The distinction between these two types is not always clear. For instance, KVM and bhyve are kernel modules that effectively convert the host operating system to a type-1 hypervisor.

==Mainframe origins==
The first hypervisors providing full virtualization were the test tool SIMMON and the one-off IBM CP-40 research system, which began production use in January 1967 and became the first version of the IBM CP/CMS operating system. CP-40 ran on a S/360-40 modified at the Cambridge Scientific Center to support dynamic address translation, a feature that enabled virtualization. Prior to this time, computer hardware had only been virtualized to the extent to allow multiple user applications to run concurrently, such as in CTSS and IBM M44/44X. With CP-40, the hardware&#x27;s &quot;supervisor state&quot; was virtualized as well, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently in separate virtual machine contexts.

Programmers soon implemented CP-40 (as CP-67) for the IBM System/360-67, the first production computer system capable of full virtualization. IBM shipped this machine in 1966; it included page-translation-table hardware for virtual memory and other techniques that allowed a full virtualization of all kernel tasks, including I/O and interrupt handling. (The &quot;official&quot; operating system, the ill-fated TSS/360, did not employ full virtualization.) Both CP-40 and CP-67 began production use in 1967. CP/CMS was available to IBM customers from 1968 to early 1970s, in source code form without support.

CP/CMS formed part of IBM&#x27;s attempt to build robust time-sharing systems for its mainframe computers. By running multiple operating systems concurrently, the hypervisor increased system robustness and stability: Even if one operating system crashed, the others would continue working without interruption. Indeed, this even allowed beta or experimental versions of operating systemsor even of new hardwareto be deployed and debugged, without jeopardizing the stable main production system, and without requiring costly additional development systems.

IBM announced its System/370 series in 1970 without the virtual memory feature needed for virtualization, but added it in the August 1972 Advanced Function announcement. Virtualization has been featured in all successor systems, such that all modern-day IBM mainframes, including the zSeries line, retain backward compatibility with the 1960s-era IBM S/360 line. The 1972 announcement also included VM/370, a reimplementation of CP/CMS for the S/370. Unlike CP/CMS, IBM provided support for this version (though it was still distributed in source code form for several releases). &quot;VM&quot; stands for &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, emphasizing that all, not just some, of the hardware interfaces are virtualized. Both VM and CP/CMS enjoyed early acceptance and rapid development by universities, corporate users, and time-sharing vendors, as well as within IBM. Users played an active role in ongoing development, anticipating trends seen in modern open source projects. However, in a series of disputed and bitter battles, time-sharing lost out to batch processing through IBM political infighting, and VM remained IBM&#x27;s &quot;other&quot; mainframe operating system for decades, losing to MVS. It enjoyed a resurgence of popularity and support from 2000 as the z/VM product, for example as the platform for Linux on IBM Z.

As mentioned above, the VM control program includes a &quot;hypervisor-call&quot; handler that intercepts DIAG (&quot;Diagnose&quot;, opcode x&#x27;83&#x27;) instructions used within a virtual machine. This provides fast-path non-virtualized execution of file-system access and other operations (DIAG is a model-dependent privileged instruction, not used in normal programming, and thus is not virtualized. It is therefore available for use as a signal to the &quot;host&quot; operating system). When first implemented in CP/CMS release 3.1, this use of DIAG provided an operating system interface that was analogous to the System/360 Supervisor Call instruction (SVC), but that did not require altering or extending the system&#x27;s virtualization of SVC.

In 1985 IBM introduced the PR/SM hypervisor to manage logical partitions (LPAR).

==Operating system support==

Several factors led to a resurgence around 2005 in the use of virtualization technology among Unix, Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems:
* Expanding hardware capabilities, allowing each single machine to do more simultaneous work
* Efforts to control costs and to simplify management through consolidation of servers
* The need to control large multiprocessor and cluster installations, for example in server farms and render farms
* The improved security, reliability, and device independence possible from hypervisor architectures
* The ability to run complex, OS-dependent applications in different hardware or OS environments
* The ability to overprovision resources, fitting more applications onto a host

Major Unix vendors, including HP, IBM, SGI, and Sun Microsystems, have been selling virtualized hardware since before 2000. These have generally been large, expensive systems (in the multimillion-dollar range at the high end), although virtualization has also been available on some low- and mid-range systems, such as IBM pSeries servers, HP Superdome series machines, and Sun/Oracle T-series CoolThreads servers.

Although Solaris has always been the only guest domain OS officially supported by Sun/Oracle on their Logical Domains hypervisor, , Linux (Ubuntu and Gentoo), and FreeBSD have been ported to run on top of the hypervisor (and can all run simultaneously on the same processor, as fully virtualized independent guest OSes). Wind River &quot;Carrier Grade Linux&quot; also runs on Sun&#x27;s Hypervisor. Full virtualization on SPARC processors proved straightforward: since its inception in the mid-1980s Sun deliberately kept the SPARC architecture clean of artifacts that would have impeded virtualization. (Compare with virtualization on x86 processors below.)

HPE provides HP Integrity Virtual Machines (Integrity VM) to host multiple operating systems on their Itanium powered Integrity systems. Itanium can run HP-UX, Linux, Windows and OpenVMS, and these environments are also supported as virtual servers on HP&#x27;s Integrity VM platform. The HP-UX operating system hosts the Integrity VM hypervisor layer that allows for multiple features of HP-UX to be taken advantage of and provides major differentiation between this platform and other commodity platforms - such as processor hotswap, memory hotswap, and dynamic kernel updates without system reboot. While it heavily leverages HP-UX, the Integrity VM hypervisor is really a hybrid that runs on bare-metal while guests are executing. Running normal HP-UX applications on an Integrity VM host is heavily discouraged, because Integrity VM implements its own memory management, scheduling and I/O policies that are tuned for virtual machines and are not as effective for normal applications. HPE also provides more rigid partitioning of their Integrity and HP9000 systems by way of VPAR and nPar technology, the former offering shared resource partitioning and the latter offering complete I/O and processing isolation. The flexibility of virtual server environment (VSE) has given way to its use more frequently in newer deployments.

IBM provides virtualization partition technology known as logical partitioning (LPAR) on System/390, zSeries, pSeries and IBM AS/400 systems. For IBM&#x27;s Power Systems, the POWER Hypervisor (PHYP) is a native (bare-metal) hypervisor in firmware and provides isolation between LPARs. Processor capacity is provided to LPARs in either a dedicated fashion or on an entitlement basis where unused capacity is harvested and can be re-allocated to busy workloads. Groups of LPARs can have their processor capacity managed as if they were in a &quot;pool&quot; - IBM refers to this capability as Multiple Shared-Processor Pools (MSPPs) and implements it in servers with the POWER6 processor. LPAR and MSPP capacity allocations can be dynamically changed. Memory is allocated to each LPAR (at LPAR initiation or dynamically) and is address-controlled by the POWER Hypervisor. For real-mode addressing by operating systems (AIX, Linux, IBM i), the Power processors (POWER4 onwards) have designed virtualization capabilities where a hardware address-offset is evaluated with the OS address-offset to arrive at the physical memory address. Input/Output (I/O) adapters can be exclusively &quot;owned&quot; by LPARs or shared by LPARs through an appliance partition known as the Virtual I/O Server (VIOS). The Power Hypervisor provides for high levels of reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) by facilitating hot add/replace of multiple parts (model dependent: processors, memory, I/O adapters, blowers, power units, disks, system controllers, etc.)

Similar trends have occurred with x86/x86-64 server platforms, where open-source projects such as Xen have led virtualization efforts. These include hypervisors built on Linux and Solaris kernels as well as custom kernels. Since these technologies span from large systems down to desktops, they are described in the next section.

==x86 systems==

X86 virtualization was introduced in the 1990s, with its emulation being included in Bochs. Intel and AMD released their first x86 processors with hardware virtualisation in 2005 with Intel VT-x (code-named Vanderpool) and AMD-V (code-named Pacifica).

An alternative approach requires modifying the guest operating system to make a system call to the underlying hypervisor, rather than executing machine I/O instructions that the hypervisor simulates. This is called paravirtualization in Xen, a &quot;hypercall&quot; in Parallels Workstation, and a &quot;DIAGNOSE code&quot; in IBM VM. Some microkernels, such as Mach and L4, are flexible enough to allow paravirtualization of guest operating systems.

==Embedded systems==
Embedded hypervisors, targeting embedded systems and certain real-time operating system (RTOS) environments, are designed with different requirements when compared to desktop and enterprise systems, including robustness, security and real-time capabilities. The resource-constrained nature of multiple embedded systems, especially battery-powered mobile systems, imposes a further requirement for small memory-size and low overhead. Finally, in contrast to the ubiquity of the x86 architecture in the PC world, the embedded world uses a wider variety of architectures and less standardized environments. Support for virtualization requires memory protection (in the form of a memory management unit or at least a memory protection unit) and a distinction between user mode and privileged mode, which rules out most microcontrollers. This still leaves x86, MIPS, ARM and PowerPC as widely deployed architectures on medium- to high-end embedded systems.

As manufacturers of embedded systems usually have the source code to their operating systems, they have less need for full virtualization in this space. Instead, the performance advantages of paravirtualization make this usually the virtualization technology of choice. Nevertheless, ARM and MIPS have recently added full virtualization support as an IP option and has included it in their latest high-end processors and architecture versions, such as ARM Cortex-A15 MPCore and ARMv8 EL2.

Other differences between virtualization in server/desktop and embedded environments include requirements for efficient sharing of resources across virtual machines, high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-VM communication, a global view of scheduling and power management, and fine-grained control of information flows.

==Security implications==

The use of hypervisor technology by malware and rootkits installing themselves as a hypervisor below the operating system, known as &quot;hyperjacking&quot;, can make them more difficult to detect because the malware could intercept any operations of the operating system (such as someone entering a password) without the anti-malware software necessarily detecting it (since the malware runs below the entire operating system). Implementation of the concept has allegedly occurred in the SubVirt laboratory rootkit (developed jointly by Microsoft and University of Michigan researchers) as well as in the Blue Pill malware package. However, such assertions have been disputed by others who claim that it would be possible to detect the presence of a hypervisor-based rootkit.

In 2009, researchers from Microsoft and North Carolina State University demonstrated a hypervisor-layer anti-rootkit called Hooksafe that can provide generic protection against kernel-mode rootkits.

<text>Habib Yunich (also russified as Yunichev; 1906–1945) was a Chinese Tatar educator, journalist, and politician. He served as the Second East Turkestan Republic&#x27;s first education minister, from the state&#x27;s establishment in 1944 until his sudden death from typhus in 1945. He was succeeded by his deputy Saifuddin Azizi.

A highly educated polyglot, Yunich was concerned primarily with improving the cultural and educational institutions of his hometown Ghulja (Yining). He founded the city&#x27;s first public library and Uyghur-language newspaper.

== Early life and education ==
Habib Yunich was born in 1906, in the Uyghur-majority city of Ghulja. His father was Faziljan, an ethnic Tatar from Russia who became a respected &quot;aqsaqal&quot; (local elder) of Ghulja. A tsarist, Faziljan chose not to return to Russia following the February Revolution of 1917 and successfully applied for Chinese citizenship.

Yunich studied in Turkey and the Soviet Union as a young adult, learning a plethora of Turkic languages in addition to his native Tatar. By the time he returned to Ghulja from Turkey in 1934, he had become fluent in Turkish, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Uzbek. He was also fluent in Chinese, English, and Russian.

Shortly after returning to Ghulja, Yunich organized the first Uyghur-language newspaper in the city, and more broadly in Ili District. He was the newspaper&#x27;s editor from 1934 to 1944. He also established Ghulja&#x27;s first public library and taught at a Tatar school in the city during the 1940s.

== Political career ==
The Second East Turkestan Republic (ETR) was proclaimed in Ghulja on 12 November 1944 by Soviet-backed Turkic revolutionaries, among them Yunich. On 18 November 1944, the ETR government appointed Yunich as Minister of Education, citing his rich cultural and linguistic education. Saifuddin Azizi, a Soviet-educated Uyghur, was appointed his deputy.

Yunich was the editor of the ETR government&#x27;s official newspaper, &quot;Free East Turkestan&quot; (later &quot;Revolutionary East Turkestan&quot;). It was published in four languagesUyghur, Russian, Kazakh, and Chineseand began circulation on 17 November 1944.

== Death ==
Yunich contracted typhus from one of his students amid an outbreak of the disease in Ghulja in the winter of 1944–45. He died in January 1945; Azizi succeeded him as the ETR&#x27;s education minister on 13 March 1945.

<doc id="1267220" wikidata="Q1246431" url="?curid=1267220" title="Sympatry">
<text>In biology, two closely related species or populations are considered sympatric when they exist in the same geographic area and thus frequently encounter each other. An initially interbreeding population that splits into two or more distinct species sharing a common range exemplifies sympatric speciation. Such speciation may be a product of reproductive isolation – which prevents hybrid offspring from being viable or able to reproduce, thereby reducing gene flow – that results in genetic divergence. Sympatric speciation may, but need not, arise through secondary contact, which refers to speciation or divergence in allopatry followed by range expansions leading to an area of sympatry. Sympatric species or taxa in secondary contact may or may not interbreed.

==Types of populations==
Four main types of population pairs exist in nature. Sympatric populations (or species) contrast with parapatric populations, which contact one another in adjacent but not shared ranges and do not interbreed; peripatric species, which are separated only by areas in which neither organism occurs; and allopatric species, which occur in entirely distinct ranges that are neither adjacent nor overlapping. Allopatric populations isolated from one another by geographical factors (e.g., mountain ranges or bodies of water) may experience genetic—and, ultimately, phenotypic—changes in response to their varying environments. These may drive allopatric speciation, which is arguably the dominant mode of speciation.

==Evolving definitions and controversy==
The lack of geographic isolation as a definitive barrier between sympatric species has yielded controversy among ecologists, biologists, botanists, and zoologists regarding the validity of the term. As such, researchers have long debated the conditions under which sympatry truly applies, especially with respect to parasitism. Because parasitic organisms often inhabit multiple hosts during a life cycle, evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr stated that internal parasites existing within different hosts demonstrate allopatry, not sympatry. Today, however, many biologists consider parasites and their hosts to be sympatric (see examples below). Conversely, zoologist Michael J. D. White considered two populations sympatric if genetic interbreeding was viable within the habitat overlap. This may be further specified as sympatry occurring within one deme; that is, reproductive individuals must be able to locate one another in the same population in order to be sympatric.

Others question the ability of sympatry to result in complete speciation: until recently, many researchers considered it nonexistent, doubting that selection alone could create disparate, but not geographically separated, species. In 2003, biologist Karen McCoy suggested that sympatry can act as a mode of speciation only when &quot;the probability of mating between two individuals depend[s] [solely] on their genotypes, [and the genes are] dispersed throughout the range of the population during the period of reproduction&quot;. In essence, sympatric speciation does require very strong forces of natural selection to be acting on heritable traits, as there is no geographic isolation to aid in the splitting process. Yet, recent research has begun to indicate that sympatric speciation is not as uncommon as was once assumed.

==Syntopy==

Syntopy is a special case of sympatry. It means the joint occurrence of two species in the same habitat at the same time. Just as the broader term sympatry, &quot;syntopy&quot; is used especially for close species that might hybridise or even be sister species. &quot;Sympatric&quot; species occur together in the same region, but do not necessarily share the same localities as &quot;syntopic&quot; species do. Areas of syntopy are of interest because they allow to study how similar species may coexist without outcompeting each other.

As an example, the two bat species &quot;Myotis auriculus&quot; and &quot;M. evotis&quot; were found to be syntopic in North America. In contrast, the marbled newt and the northern crested newt have a large sympatric range in western France, but differ in their habitat preferences and only rarely occur syntopically in the same breeding ponds.

==Sympatric speciation==
The lack of geographic constraint in isolating sympatric populations implies that the emerging species avoid interbreeding via other mechanisms. Before speciation is complete, two diverging populations may still produce viable offspring. As speciation progresses, isolating mechanisms – such as gametic incompatibility that renders fertilization of the egg impossible – are selected for in order to increase the reproductive divide between the two populations.

===Species discrimination===
Sympatric groups frequently show a greater ability to discriminate between their own species and other closely related species than do allopatric groups. This is shown in the study of hybrid zones. It is also apparent in the differences in levels of prezygotic isolation (by factors that prevent formation of a viable zygote) in both sympatric and allopatric populations. There are two main theories regarding this process: 1) differential fusion, which suggests that only populations with a keen ability to discriminate between species will persist in sympatry; and 2) character displacement, which implies that distinguishing characteristics will be heightened in areas where the species co-occur in order to facilitate discrimination.

====Reinforcement====
Reinforcement is the process by which natural selection reinforces reproductive isolation. In sympatry, reinforcement increases species discrimination and sexual adaptation in order to avoid maladaptive hybridization and encourage speciation. If hybrid offspring are either sterile or less-fit than non-hybrid offspring, mating between members of two different species will be selected against. Natural selection decreases the probability of such hybridization by selecting for the ability to identify mates of one&#x27;s own species from those of another species.

====Reproductive character displacement====
Reproductive character displacement strengthens the reproductive barriers between sympatric species by encouraging the divergence of traits that are crucial to reproduction. Divergence is frequently distinguished by assortative mating between individuals of the two species. For example, divergence in the mating signals of two species will limit hybridization by reducing one&#x27;s ability to identify an individual of the second species as a potential mate. Support for the reproductive character displacement hypothesis comes from observations of sympatric species in overlapping habitats in nature. Increased prezygotic isolation, which is associated with reproductive character displacement, has been observed in cicadas of genus &quot;Magicicada&quot;, stickleback fish, and the flowering plants of the genus &quot;Phlox&quot;.

====Differential fusion====
An alternative explanation for species discrimination in sympatry is differential fusion. This hypothesis states that of the many species have historically come into contact with one another, the only ones that persist in sympatry (and thus are seen today) are species with strong mating discrimination. On the other hand, species lacking strong mating discrimination are assumed to have fused while in contact, forming one distinct species.

Differential fusion is less widely recognized than character displacement, and several of its implications are refuted by experimental evidence. For example, differential fusion implies greater postzygotic isolation among sympatric species, as this functions to prevent fusion between the species. However, Coyne and Orr found equal levels of postzygotic isolation among sympatric and allopatric species pairs in closely related &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Nevertheless, differential fusion remains a possible, though not complete, contributor to species discrimination.

==Examples==
Sympatry has been increasingly evidenced in current research. Because of this, sympatric speciation – which was once highly debated among researchers – is progressively gaining credibility as a viable form of speciation.

===Orca: partial sympatry===
Several distinct types of killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), which are characterized by an array of morphological and behavioral differences, live in sympatry throughout the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Antarctic oceans. In the North Pacific, three whale populations – called &quot;transient&quot;, &quot;resident&quot;, and &quot;offshore&quot; – demonstrate partial sympatry, crossing paths with relative frequency. The results of recent genetic analyses using mtDNA indicate that this is due to secondary contact, in which the three types encountered one another following the bidirectional migration of &quot;offshore&quot; and &quot;resident&quot; whales between the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Partial sympatry in these whales is, therefore, not the result of speciation. Furthermore, killer whale populations that consist of all three types have been documented in the Atlantic, evidencing that interbreeding occurs among them. Thus, secondary contact does not always result in total reproductive isolation, as has often been predicted.

===Great spotted cuckoo and magpie: brood parasitism===

The parasitic great spotted cuckoo (&quot;Clamator glandarius&quot;) and its magpie host, both native to Southern Europe, are completely sympatric species. However, the duration of their sympatry varies with location. For example, great spotted cuckoos and their magpie hosts in Hoya de Gaudix, southern Spain, have lived in sympatry since the early 1960s, while species in other locations have more recently become sympatric. Great spotted cuckoos, when in South Africa, are sympatric with at least 8 species of starling and 2 crows, pied crow and Cape crow.

The great spotted cuckoo exhibits brood parasitism by laying a mimicked version of the magpie egg in the magpie&#x27;s nest. Since cuckoo eggs hatch before magpie eggs, magpie hatchlings must compete with cuckoo hatchlings for resources provided by the magpie mother. This relationship between the cuckoo and the magpie in various locations can be characterized as either recently sympatric or anciently sympatric. The results of an experiment by Soler and Moller (1990) showed that in areas of ancient sympatry (species in cohabitation for many generations), magpies were more likely to reject most of the cuckoo eggs, as these magpies had developed counter-adaptations that aid in identification of egg type. In areas of recent sympatry, magpies rejected comparatively fewer cuckoo eggs. Thus, sympatry can cause coevolution, by which both species undergo genetic changes due to the selective pressures that one species exerts on the other.

===&quot;Acromyrmex&quot; ant: isolation of fungal gardens===
Leafcutter ants protect and nourish various species of fungus as a source of food in a system known as ant-fungus mutualism. Leafcutter ants belonging to the genus &quot;Acromyrmex&quot; are known for their mutualistic relationship with Basidiomycete fungi. Ant colonies are closely associated with their fungus colonies, and may have co-evolved with a consistent vertical lineage of fungi in individual colonies. Ant populations defend against the horizontal transmission of foreign fungi to their fungal colony, as this transmission may lead to competitive stress on the local fungal garden. Invaders are identified and removed by the ant colony, inhibiting competition and fungal interbreeding. This active isolation of individual populations helps maintain the genetic purity of the fungal colony, and this mechanism may lead to sympatric speciation within a shared habitat.

<text>The Weißkirchen radio transmitter was a medium-wave broadcasting facility located near Weißkirchen, Oberursel, Germany. It was the most powerful European AM transmitter of the American Forces Network and transmitted on 873 kHz with a power of 150 kilowatts. It started operation in May 1951 on 872 kHz and moved its frequency to 873 kHz in 1978 according to the regulations of Waveplan of Geneva. The transmitter ceased broadcasting on 31 May 2013, and was decommissioned in September 2014. Its aerial consisted of three guyed lattice steel masts built in 1954–55. These masts, each eighty-six metres tall and insulated against ground, were arranged in a row with a distance of 140 metres between each mast. On 23 April 2015 the aerial was dismantled.

As the numbers of American forces stationed in Europe has waxed and waned over the years, in response to developments in politics such as the end of the Cold War, this transmitter remained operational, though its observed signal strength appeared far less able to compete with other medium-wave broadcasters compared to reception reports made in the early to mid-1970s. For many European listeners in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, its relays of United States domestic networks provided the only American radio receivable in Germany, apart from stations specifically intended for overseas reception, such as the Voice of America.

<text>Claude François Geoffroy (1729 – 18 June 1753) was a French chemist. In 1753 he proved the chemical element bismuth to be distinct from lead, becoming the official discoverer of the element. Before this time, bismuth-containing minerals were frequently misidentified as either lead, tin, or antimony ores. His observations on the matter were published in the &quot;Mémoires de l’académie française&quot; in 1753.

He became a master apothecary in 1748, and in 1752 he was admitted to the Académie des sciences as a supernumerary adjoint chemist. He died on 18 June 1753, (age 23 or 24).

He is known as Claude Geoffroy the Younger to distinguish him from his father Claude Joseph Geoffroy (1685–1752), also a French chemist and apothecary, member of the Académie des sciences.

<doc id="1267228" wikidata="Q1812130" url="?curid=1267228" title="Mandaic alphabet">
<text>The Mandaic alphabet is a writing system primarily used to write the Mandaic language. It is thought to have evolved between the second and seventh century CE from either a cursive form of Aramaic (as did Syriac) or from Inscriptional Parthian. The exact roots of the script are difficult to determine.
It was developed by members of the Mandaean faith of Lower Mesopotamia to write the Mandaic language for liturgical purposes. Classical Mandaic and its descendant Neo-Mandaic are still in limited use. The script has changed very little over centuries of use.

The Mandaic name for the script is &quot;Abagada&quot; or &quot;Abaga&quot;, after the first letters of the alphabet. Rather than the traditional Semitic letter names (&quot;aleph&quot;, &quot;beth&quot;, &quot;gimel&quot;), they are known as &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;ga&quot; and so on.

It is written from right to left in horizontal lines. It is a cursive script, but not all letters connect within a word. Spaces separate individual words.

During the past few decades, Majid Fandi Al-Mubaraki, a Mandaean living in Australia, has digitized many Mandaean texts using typeset Mandaic script.

==Letters==
The Mandaic alphabet contains 22 letters (in the same order as the Aramaic alphabet) and the digraph &quot;adu&quot;. The alphabet is formally closed by repeating the first letter, &quot;a&quot;, so that it has a symbolic count of 24 letters:

===Vowels===
Unlike most other Semitic alphabets, vowels are usually written out in full. The first letter, &quot;a&quot; (corresponding to &quot;alaph&quot;), is used to represent a range of open vowels. The sixth letter, &quot;wa&quot;, is used for close back vowels (&quot;u&quot; and &quot;o&quot;), and the tenth letter, &quot;ya&quot; is used for close front vowels (&quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot;). These last two can also serve as the consonants &quot;w/v&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. The eighth letter corresponds to the Semitic &quot;heth&quot;, and is called &quot;eh&quot;; it is pronounced as a long &quot;i&quot;-vowel but is used only as a suffix for the third person singular. The sixteenth letter, &quot;e&quot; (Aramaic &quot;ayn&quot;), usually represents &quot;e&quot; at the beginning of a word or, when followed by &quot;wa&quot; or &quot;ya&quot;, represents initial &quot;u&quot; or &quot;i&quot; respectively.

A mark similar to an underscore () can be used to distinguish vowel quality for three Mandaic vowels. It is used in teaching materials but may be omitted from ordinary text. It is only used with vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;wa&quot;, and &quot;ya&quot;. Using the letter &quot;ba&quot; as an example:

* /bā/ becomes /ba/
* /bu/ becomes /bo/
* /bi/ becomes /be/

===Gemination mark===
A dot under a consonant () can be used to note gemination, indicating what native writers call a &quot;hard&quot; pronunciation.
Sample words include (ekka) &#x27;there is&#x27;, (šenna) &#x27;tooth&#x27;, (lebba) &#x27;heart&#x27;, and (rabba) &#x27;great&#x27;.

===Ligatures===
The 23rd letter of the alphabet is the digraph &quot;adu&quot; (&quot;da&quot; + &quot;ya&quot;), the relative particle (cf. Arabic tāʾ marbūṭah, Coptic letter &quot;ti&quot;, and English ampersand).

In addition to normal joining behavior, some Mandaic letters can combine to form various ligatures:
* /kd/, /kḏ/, /ki/, /kl/, /kr/, /kt/, and /ku/
* /nd/, /ni/, /nm/, /nq/, /nt/, and /nu/
* /pl/, /pr/, and /pu/
* /sˤl/, /sˤr/, and /sˤu/
* /ut/

Both &quot;adu&quot; () and the old ligature kḏ () are treated as single characters in Unicode.

===Similar characters===
Due to their similar shapes, certain Mandaic characters are sometimes confused with each other by both historical Mandaean scribes and modern scholars, particularly in handwritten manuscripts. These include the following.
* /d/, /r/, /e/, /q/
* /u/, /i/
* /m/, /t/
* /k/, /n/, /p/
* /pa/, /ana/, /ʃ/
* /sˤ/, /hn/

==Extensions==
===Affrication mark===

Postclassical and modern Mandaic use many Persian words. Various Mandaic letters can be re-purposed by placing two horizontally-aligned dots underneath (). This idea is comparable to the four novel letters in the Persian alphabet, allowing the alphabet to be used to represent foreign sounds (whether affrication, lenition, or another sound):
* /g/ becomes /ɣ/
* /d/ becomes /ð/
* /h/ becomes /ħ/
* /tˤ/ becomes /ðˤ/
* /k/ becomes /x/
* /p/ becomes /f/
* /ṣ/ becomes /ʒ/
* /ʃ/ becomes /tʃ/, /dʒ/
* /t/ becomes /θ/

===Ayin===

Mandaic ayin () is borrowed from Arabic ayin (). Unlike in Arabic, Mandaic ayin does not join with other letters.

==Punctuation and other marks==

Punctuation is sparsely used in Mandaic text. A break in text can be indicated by two concentric circles ().

A horizontal low line () can be used to justify text.

==Religious use==

Each letter of the Mandaic alphabet is said to represent a power of life and light.
Mandaeans view their alphabet as magical and sacred.

Acrostic hymns can be found in Mandaic literature, for example in Book 12 of the &quot;Right Ginza&quot;.

The Semitic alphabet contains 22 letters. In order to bring this number to 24, the number of hours in a day, &quot;adu&quot; was added and &quot;a&quot; was repeated as the last letter of the Mandaic alphabet. Without this repetition, the alphabet would be considered incomplete for magical purposes.

==Unicode==

The Mandaic alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0.

The Unicode block for Mandaic is U+0840–U+085F:

<text>&quot;David Michaels&quot; is a pseudonym for the authors of novels in the &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;, &quot;EndWar&quot;, &quot;H.A.W.X&quot;, and &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; series, all of which were created by Ubisoft and developed under Ubisoft&#x27;s Tom Clancy license. The novel series began as video games for various console systems as well as the PC. As of February 2011, &quot;Michaels&quot; has released six &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; novels, two &quot;EndWar&quot; novels, two &quot;Ghost Recon&quot; novels, and one &quot;H.A.W.X&quot; novel.

The first two &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; novels were written by Raymond Benson. However, in 2006, Benson announced he was finished with &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; and that the next novel would be written by a different author under the same pseudonym. The last known author is Grant Blackwood. The current author is unknown, but he uses the David Michaels pseudonym. With the publication of &quot;Splinter Cell: Blacklist Aftermath&quot; in 2013, Peter Telep assumed the role of writer for the series. Unlike the previous &quot;David Michaels&quot; novels, Telep is credited on &quot;Blacklist Aftermath&quot; by name.

<text>Thymallus yaluensis, also known as Yalu grayling, is a putative species of freshwater ray-finned fish in the genus &quot;Thymallus&quot; (graylings) of the family Salmonidae. It is endemic to the upper Yalu River on the China-North Korea border.

== Description ==
&quot;Thymallus yaluensis&quot; is a small fish, with a maximum recorded length of . It is renowned in Korea for having &quot;the most beautiful form and fins of a freshwater fish&quot;.

== Taxonomy dispute ==
Some confusion exists regarding the identity of &quot;T. yaluensis&quot;, as it closely resembles the Arctic grayling (&quot;Thymallus arcticus)&quot; in form and has often been treated as a subspecies (&quot;T. a. yaluensis)&quot;. However, FishBase recognizes it as an independent species. According to mitochondrial DNA, &quot;T. yaluensis&quot; is, however, inseparable from the Amur grayling (&quot;Thymallus grubii&quot;), and was suggested to be a junior synonym of that. Confusingly, it has also been reported from widely separate regions including Siberia, the Alps in Europe, and the northern Mississippi River drainage in North America.

<text>The Mazda 727C is a prototype racing car that was built for Mazdaspeed for the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the Group C2 class. It replaced the 717C in 1984 as an evolution of the Mooncraft-built design, and used the same 2-rotor &quot;13B&quot; Wankel engine as the previous model.

Two 727Cs were entered in the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing 4th and 6th in the C2 class. However, a pair of Lola T616s run by B.F. Goodrich Company used the same Mazda engine and were successful in beating both 727Cs, claiming 1st and 3rd.

The 727C was used a few more times in the 1984 World Sportscar Championship season, managing a mere 10th place in the C2 manufacturer&#x27;s championship, behind two separate teams of privateers. The 727C was then replaced by the 737C in 1985.</text><links>

<text>Edmond Henri Adolphe Schérer (April 8, 1815March 16, 1889) was a French theologian, critic and politician.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris. After a course of legal studies, he spent several years in theological study at Strasbourg, where he graduated in theology in 1843, and was ordained. In 1843, he was appointed professor of exegesis in the École Évangélique at Geneva (popularly known as L&#x27;Oratoire). The development of his opinions in favour of the Liberal movement in Protestant theology led to his resigning the post six years later. He founded the &quot;Anti-Jesuite&quot;, afterwards the &quot;Réformation au XIXe siècle&quot;, in which he advocated the separation of the Church from the State; but he gradually abandoned Protestant doctrine.

In thought he became a pronounced Hegelian. Eventually he settled in Paris, where he at once attracted attention by brilliant literary criticisms, at first chiefly on great foreign writers, contributed to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;. He was elected municipal councillor at Versailles in 1870, deputy to the National Assembly for the department Seine-et-Oise in 1871 and senator for life in 1875. He supported the Republican party.

Towards the end of his life, he devoted self mainly to literary and general criticism, and was for many years one of the ablest contributors to &quot;Le Temps&quot;. He was a frequent visitor to England, and took a lively interest in English politics and literature. He died at Versailles.

<text>Martin Glover (born 27 December 1960), better known by his stage name Youth, is a British musician and record producer, best known as a founding member and bassist of the rock band Killing Joke. He is also a member of the Fireman, along with Paul McCartney.

== Early career ==
Martin Glover was born on 27 December 1960 in Slough, at that point part of Buckinghamshire, England. He attended private boarding school Kingham Hill School in Oxfordshire, where he met Alex Paterson, who would become a roadie for Glover&#x27;s band Killing Joke, and later founder of the Orb. Naming himself Youth after the roots reggae chanter Big Youth, in 1977 he joined punk rock band the Rage, who toured with the Adverts. Later he joined &quot;4 Be 2&quot;, a band formed by John Lydon&#x27;s brother Jimmy Lydon, and recorded the &quot;One of the Lads&quot; single with them.

Youth was the original bass player in Killing Joke but left the band in 1982 and soon after founded his own band Brilliant with future the KLF member Jimmy Cauty. The act recorded one album with producers Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) in 1985 before disbanding.

Youth also played bass on the Bollock Brothers&#x27; disco-mix 12-inch, &quot;The Slow Removal of Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s Left Ear&quot; (1982). 

In 1989, Youth and Alex Paterson started the WAU! Mr. Modo label.

Youth was asked by Adrian Sherwood to remix some of Bim Sherman&#x27;s tracks for a reworking of the &quot;Miracle&quot; album. He also appeared on a Ted Parsons/NIC dub album, contributing a remix which opens with a sample from Glen Brown&#x27;s &quot;Version &#x27;78&quot;, a track originally released on the South East label.

In the early nineties, Youth formed techno and house music duo Blue Pearl together with American singer Durga McBroom. They scored a handful of hit singles including their blue vinyl debut &quot;Naked in the Rain&quot;, which reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart and was also a No. 5 dance hit in the U.S. in 1990. It was followed by &quot;Little Brother&quot; and &quot;(Can You) Feel the Passion&quot;. An album, &quot;Naked&quot;, was also released.

In 1994, Youth rejoined Killing Joke and their album &quot;Pandemonium&quot; was released on his Butterfly Recordings label, as was the 1996 follow-up, &quot;Democracy&quot;.

He is credited with founding the first psychedelic trance record label, Dragonfly Records, as well as the Liquid Sound Design and Kamaflage Records labels. He is well known in the psychedelic trance scene, collaborating with Simon Posford and Saul Davies as Celtic Cross, with Greg Hunter and Simon Posford as Dub Trees, and on the project Zodiac Youth. He has performed both full-on trance as well as chill-out DJ sets at several Return to the Source parties, and released the Ambient Meditations 3 mix album on their label in 2000. His Butterfly Studios were also home of the Return to the Source offices circa 1999–2002.

== Later career ==

Youth&#x27;s Butterfly Records label has produced artists such as Take That, Wet Wet Wet, Tom Jones, the Orb, System 7, Maria McKee and Heather Nova. Youth was the co-producer of the Verve&#x27;s &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; and Dolores O&#x27;Riordan&#x27;s &quot;Are You Listening?&quot;. He has also worked, produced and remixed for artists including Kate Bush, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Primal Scream, Embrace, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Gaudi, Art of Noise, Crowded House, Zoe, P.M. Dawn, Pop Will Eat Itself, Yazoo, Erasure, U2, Bananarama, INXS, James and Suns of Arqa.

Youth had also made plans to work with Duran Duran in the later stages of their lost album &quot;Reportage&quot;, before it was shelved later in 2006.

In 2008, Youth produced the Delays album &quot;Everything&#x27;s the Rush&quot;, the Futureheads&#x27; &quot;This Is Not The World&quot; and worked on the debut album of American band The Daylights. In 2013, Glover produced the debut album &quot;Collective&quot; by the DIY indie rock band Echotape, followed by &quot;Meteorites&quot; by Echo and the Bunnymen and &quot;Lion&quot; by Peter Murphy. The following year, Glover produced Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;Tribes&quot; album.

Youth is a member of the band Transmission, together with Simon Tong of the Verve, Paul Ferguson of Killing Joke and Tim Bran of Dreadzone. He also played guitar on several tracks on the 2007 Client album &quot;Heartland&quot;.

In mid-2010, he teamed up with Alex Paterson (of the Orb) to compile a retrospective compilation album of tracks from the WAU! Mr Modo label. The album titled &quot;Impossible Oddities&quot; was released on CD and double vinyl on 25 October 2010 via Year Zero Records.

In 2011, he recorded &quot;Generation Indigo&quot;, a fusion of punk, dub, ambient and techno with Poly Styrene of early punk rock band X-Ray Spex.

On 27 October 2012, during the International Festival of Music Producers and Sound Designers SOUNDEDIT, Youth was awarded The Man with the Golden Ear Award.

In 2016, he received the PPL Music Producers Guild Lifetime Achievement award and released the album &quot;Create Christ, Sailor Boy&quot; with David Tibet as Hypnopazūzu.

In 2017, he teamed with Gaudi for two collaborative releases as &#x27;YOUTH &amp; GAUDI&#x27;: the vinyl 10in &#x27;2063: A Dub Odyssey&#x27; (printed on a limited edition green vinyl) and their debut album &#x27;Astronaut Alchemists&#x27;, both on Liquid Sound Design.
Subsequently, the duo released the double album &#x27;Astronaut Alchemists – Remixes&#x27; featuring Banco de Gaia, The Orb, Kaya Project, Bombay Dub Orchestra, Kuba, Gabriel Le Mar, Pitch Black, BUS/Gus Till, Vlastur, Deep Fried Dub, The Egg, Jef Stott/Aslan Dub, Onium, Living Light, Sadhu Sensi, DM-Theory and Uncle Fester On Acid.

In 2018, he recorded a collaborative album with Nik Turner. &quot;Pharaohs from Outer Space&quot; was released by Painted Word on 17 August 2018.

In 2019 he teamed with Italian musician Emilio Sorridente and created The Dream Symposium. They recorded the space rock album &quot;Green Electric Muse&quot;, produced by Youth and released in 2020 by Youthsounds Records. In the same year, he worked with Public Image Ltd&#x27;s Keith Levene and Richard Dudanski on a single about the Brexit revolt with Mark Stewart of the Pop Group on vocals. 

In 2021, he received the Grammy Award in the category Best Reggae Album as a producer of &quot;Got to Be Tough&quot; by Toots and the Maytals.

<text>The [[Mazda]] 717C is a prototype racing car built for Mazdaspeed for the 24 Hours of Le Mans under the Group C Junior formula. It was the first race car built by Mazda since the ending of their running in GT with the RX-7 in 1982. It used a 2-rotor &quot;13B&quot; Wankel engine, similar to the production engine in the Mazda RX-7.

The bodywork and chassis were actually built by Mooncraft racing with assistance from Mazda.

Two 717Cs were entered at 1983 24 Hours of Le Mans, being the only finishers in the C Junior class, and finishing 12th and 18th overall.

The following year the car would be replaced by the 727C. The Yamaha OX99-11 is said to have a similar design from the 717C.

<doc id="1267251" wikidata="Q7833202" url="?curid=1267251" title="Trampolining terms">
<text>Trampolining terms are used to describe various positions and types of skill performed in the sport of trampolining.

==Basic skills==
* Straight Jump – A vertical jump with the body held straight and arms in a straight line above the body at take-off.
* Tuck Jump – From a straight jump start, the knees are pulled up to the chest and the hands must at least briefly grasp the legs between the knees and ankle. 
* Pike Jump – Again from a straight jump start, the legs are straight, held together and lifted parallel to the trampoline and the arms and body reach forwards towards the pointed toes.
* Straddle Jump – Similar to the pike jump except that the legs are spread sideways approximately 90° apart and the arms reach forward towards the pointed toes.
* Seat Drop or Seat Landing – Landing in a seated position with the legs straight. The hands support the body one either side and very slightly behind the posterior, palms down with fingers pointed towards the pointed toes.
* Seat Landing Half Twist to Seat Landing or Swivel Hips – Performing a seat landing, bounce up to a straight position (without landing) and then perform a half twist and land in the second seat landing facing in the opposite direction. 
* Half Twist and Full Twist – While in a straight jump position rotating the body until facing the opposite direction for a half twist or a complete 360° rotation for a full twist.
* Stomach Drop, Front Drop or Front Landing – Landing horizontally on the bed, face down, with the arms bent to form a diamond shape with the hands overlapping slightly in front of the face. The legs should be bent slightly at the knee keeping the feet off the trampoline bed. But otherwise held in tension for a good landing.
* Back Drop or Back Landing – Landing on the bed on the back. The legs are bent up at about 90° on landing with legs held straight and the head is held in line with the body flat on the bed (to avoid whiplash injury).
* Hands and Knees 3/4 turnover – Bouncing on hands and knees then making a forward rotation to land in either Back Drop, to your feet or Seat Drop.
* Turntable – from front drop, bouncing, staying horizontal, performing a half twist around, then landing in front drop.
* Back drop half twist to back drop or Cradle – From back drop, bouncing up and rotating forwards, then performing a half twist, landing in back drop.

==Intermediate skills==
* Front Somersault – One complete forward rotation; the body can be in any of the tucked, piked or straight (rarely seen other than to develop straight barani) positions. 
* Back Somersault – One complete backward rotation; the body can be in any of the tucked, piked or straight positions.
* Side Somersault – One complete left or right rotation; this is usually performed tucked, but advanced variations include piked: straight legs (bent body). The straight position is impossible as the asymmetry will develop severe twisting and transform the side somersault into a back somersault.

==Advanced skills==
* Barani – A front somersault with a half twist before landing; also known as a front-half.
* 3/4 front (Crash Dive) – Three-quarter straight front somersault that lands in the back drop position. 
* 1 and 3/4 front (1 and 3, 217) – One and three quarter front somersault (performed in tucked or pike shape) that lands in the back drop position.
* 2 and 3/4 front (2 and 3, 317) – Two and three quarter front somersault that lands in the back drop position.
* 1 and 1/4 front – One and one quarter front somersault (performed in tucked or pike shape) that lands in the front drop position.

This is to make it easier for the performer to &#x27;spot&#x27; the bed prior to landing.
* Somersaults may be performed in one of four positions: tuck, pike, straight (or layout), and puck. The tuck position is considered the least difficult. Somersaults done in pike or straight position are more difficult, and each complete rotation is awarded a 0.1 bonus to Degree of Difficulty. Puck position is a body position intermediate between tuck and pike, and is used in multiple twisting somersaults.
* Skiing tricks - these next tricks are usually done off axis, not allowed in traditional trampoline competitions and usually performed with a special tuck - a grab. They have a simple naming rule: first the trick and then how many degrees you’re rotating. For example, let’s say you’re doing a cork 720. Since it is a single flip (it would otherwise be a &quot;double&quot; or &quot;triple&quot; cork), 360 degrees are used for the flip rotation. Now there’s 360 degrees left for a twist. That means that a cork 720 is an off axis back full. Let’s say the trick is a double cork 1080. 720 degrees are used for the two flip rotations, since it is a double, and the remaining 360 are used for a twist. You are allowed to put the twist anywhere you want in the double flip, which means in trampoline terms a double cork 1080 could be an off axis full in, full out or half half. Now for the tricks.
* Cork - an off axis backflip/ twist. It does not need to be rotated over the head. When you add a lot of twists the cork tends to look like it isn’t a flip, but that’s not true
* Misty - an off axis frontflip/twist. This is the same as a cork but forward. 
* Flatspin - an off axis combined sideflip/backflip. This is more of a flip than a cork 360.
* Shant - another name for the cork 360. This is more of a twist than a flatspin.
* Rodéo - 
* Pistol flip - a double sideflip with a full twist in the middle. You have to let go of the tuck to do the twist and then you tuck again to do another sideflip.

==Competition Terms==
* Degree of Difficulty (DD) or Tariff – A score added to the execution score which reflects the difficulty of the skills included in the routine.
* Voluntary or Optional Routine (Vol) – A routine comprising skills chosen by the athlete or coach to reflect their best performance. Usually the routine must have a minimum (and sometimes at lower skill levels, a maximum) degree of difficulty.
* Compulsory Routine (Set) – A routine which has a set list of skills and a set order which must be followed by all athletes in a competition. No degree of difficulty marks are given for this routine; the marks are purely for execution.
* Time of flight (ToF) – A score added to the execution score which reflects the time the gymnast spends in the air when performing the routine.
* Horizontal Displacement (HD score) – A score added to the total score. The score is calculated by how much the athlete is out of the &quot;box&quot; during the routine.

<text>John Christian Schetky (11 August 1778 – 29 January 1874) was a Scottish painter who specialised in marine art.
==Early life==
Schetky was descended from an old Hungarian-Transylvanian family, which, for political reasons, had emigrated to Leipzig at the beginning of the 16th century. His father was Johann Georg Christoff Schetky, a celebrated composer and cellist, who had settled in Edinburgh in 1773, and had married Maria Anna Theresa Reinagle, also of Hungarian descent, in 1774. John Christian was the couple&#x27;s fourth son. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, where he formed a lifelong friendship with his near-contemporary, Walter Scott.

==Career==
Schetky studied art under Alexander Nasmyth. After travelling on the continent, he settled in Oxford, where he taught for six years as a drawing-master. In 1808 he obtained a post in the Royal Military College at Great Marlow; and three years later he was appointed professor of drawing in the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, where he had ample opportunities for the study of his favourite marine subjects. Following the abolition of the Naval College, he held a similar professorship from 1836 to 1855 at the East India Company&#x27;s Military Seminary at Addiscombe, Surrey, where the cadets nicknamed him &quot;Sepia Jack&quot;.

From 1805 to 1872 he contributed periodically to the Royal Academy summer exhibitions, and he was represented at the Westminster Hall competition of 1847 by a large oil painting of the Battle of La Hogue. He was marine painter to George IV, William IV and Queen Victoria.

Among his published works were the illustrations to Lord John Manners&#x27;s &quot;Sketches and Notes of a Cruise in Scotch Waters&quot; (1850); and a volume entitled &quot;Reminiscences of the Veterans of the Sea&quot; (1867), which containing photographs of twenty of his paintings and drawings of the great wooden fighting vessels of the Royal Navy.

One of his best-known works, the &quot;Loss of the Royal George&quot;, painted in 1840, is now in Tate Britain. The United Service Club formerly possessed another important marine painting, showing HMS &quot;Endymion&quot;, under the command of Sir Charles Paget, rescuing a French man-of-war from extreme danger of shipwreck.

Schetky died in London on 28 January 1874.

==Personal life==
Schetky married Charlotte Trevenen in 1828. She died in 1867.

His brother John Alexander Schetky was also a painter.

==Biography==
A memoir by his daughter, entitled &quot;Ninety Years of Work and Play&quot;, was published in 1877.

<doc id="1267260" wikidata="Q5444961" url="?curid=1267260" title="Fernando Viña">
<text>Fernando Viña ; born April 16, 1969) is a Cuban-American former Major League Baseball second baseman and former MLB analyst for ESPN. His parents Andres and Olga emigrated from Cuba in 1968. From through , Viña played for the Seattle Mariners (1993), New York Mets (), Milwaukee Brewers (-), St. Louis Cardinals (-), and Detroit Tigers ().

==Career==
Viña was acquired by the Brewers on December 22, 1994, to complete a transaction that began three weeks earlier on November 30 when Doug Henry was traded to the Mets and also included minor-league catcher Javier Gonzalez being sent to Milwaukee on December 6.

On May 31, 1996, while attempting to tag the runner and make a throw to first to complete a double play, Viña was caught off guard and knocked down by Albert Belle, an incident which led to Belle receiving a 5-game suspension from the American League. In a 2018 interview, Viña good-naturedly laughed about the incident, claiming &quot;that put me on the map,&quot; meaning that the play was regularly featured in highlight footage on television.

Viña was a two-time Gold Glove winner (-), and a National League All-Star in , becoming the first ever NL representative from the Brewers, who had moved to the league that year.

In 2004, he was limited to 29 games for the Tigers—a serious leg injury ended his first season with Detroit, and Viña missed the entire 2005 season because of a strained right hamstring and patellar tendinitis in his left knee, but his signing was the first of several major acquisitions that led to the Tigers&#x27; resurrection to a playoff contender.

In 2006, Viña was invited to spring training by the Seattle Mariners but was cut before the start of the season due to a labrum tear in his right hip, in effect bringing an end to his 12-year career. Viña retired with a .282 batting average, 40 home runs and 343 RBI in 1148 games played. In 2007, Viña joined ESPN as an analyst for &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; to do about 60 shows during the 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons. He was inducted into the Arizona State Hall of Fame in 2011 and Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor in 2014. He hit the first inside-the-park home run ever in both AT&amp;T Park and Miller Park.

==Mitchell Report==
On December 13, 2007, Viña was mentioned in the Mitchell Report in connection with steroid use. The report cited an interview with former Mets clubhouse attendant Derek Sprang, who claimed Viña purchased anabolic steroids from him six to eight times between 2000 and 2005. The two first met in 1993 when Viña was in the Mets minor league system, and Viña&#x27;s personal contact information was listed in Radomski&#x27;s address book seized by federal agents investigating Radomski. Three checks from Viña to Kirk Radomski for purchases of HGH and steroids were included in the Mitchell Report itself as further evidence of Viña&#x27;s steroid use. Viña later confirmed during an airing of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; that he used HGH in 2003 to recover from injuries, but denied ever using steroids or purchasing them from Radomski.

==Popular culture==
Viña was featured in the music video for Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s Welcome To Atlanta (Coast to Coast Remix) with Nelly, Murphy Lee and the St. Lunatics.

<text>Wacław Piotr Rzewuski (1706–1779) was a Polish dramatist and poet as well as a military commander and a Grand Crown Hetman. As a notable nobleman and magnate, Rzewuski held a number of important posts in the administration of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

== Biography ==
He was a Field Clerk of the Crown since 1732, voivode of Podole Voivodship between 1736 and 1762 (with a gap between 1750 and 1756). In 1735 he received the prestigious Order of the White Eagle.

A Castellan of several notable towns, he was an important politician at the Royal Court in Warsaw and was one of the main supporters of the liberum veto during the Diet of 1764, when he became known for his dispute with Szymon Konarski. During the Diet of 1767 (Repnin Sejm) he opposed Prince Nikolai Repnin&#x27;s - Russia&#x27;s ambassador to the Commonwealth - interfering in Poland&#x27;s domestic affairs. In response, he was kidnapped along with his son Seweryn and two other prominent Polish politicians by Russian agents and imprisoned in Kaluga. Upon his release in April 1773 he was promoted for his merits to the rank of Grand Crown Hetman, but resigned the post in November of that year.

Since 1778 he was the Castellan of Kraków and the Voivode of Kraków Voivodship. At the end of his life he was also the Starost of Chełm, Ułany, Romanów, Dolina, Drohobycz and Kruszwica.

As a writer, Rzewuski authored a number of classicist comedies (including the 1759 play &quot;Natręt&quot;) and several historical tragedies, including a biography of Stanisław Żółkiewski (1758). He also published a number of poems and a poetic handbook &quot;On the Science of Poetry&quot; (1762). All of his works were published in 1962.

He was the great-grandfather of Ewelina Hańska, wife of French author Honoré de Balzac.

Rzewuski owned Pidhirtsi Castle and also the nearby Olesko Castle.

She married Rzewuski in 1732.

On September 14, 1748, while she stayed in Vienna, she was received the Order of the Starry Cross, which was the highest Austrian state badge for women at the time.

<doc id="1267274" wikidata="Q1971747" url="?curid=1267274" title="Saltimbanco">
<text>Saltimbanco was a touring show by Cirque du Soleil. &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; ran from 1992 to 2006 in its original form, performed under a large circus tent called the Grand Chapiteau; its last performance in that form was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on December 10, 2006. A new adaptation of the show started touring North America on July 31, 2007, with its first stop in London, Ontario, Canada. The new version was staged in arenas with fewer performances in each city it visited. The new version closed at the end of 2012.

The show was described by Cirque du Soleil as a celebration of life. Its creators say they developed it as an antidote to the violence and despair prevalent in the 20th century.

==Etymology==
English has lost the word &quot;saltimbank&quot; from current usage; but it is still familiar in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian as &quot;saltimbanco&quot;, and in French as &quot;saltimbanque&quot;, meaning &quot;street acrobat&quot; or &quot;entertainer&quot;. According to the company&#x27;s site, the word &quot;saltimbanco&quot; comes from the Italian &quot;saltare in banco&quot;, which means &quot;to jump on a bench.&quot; The etymology of the word reflects its acrobatic associations. A &quot;salto&quot; means a &quot;jump&quot; in Italian; &quot;banco&quot; in this connection is a trestle holding a board, set up as a temporary stage for open-air performers. &#x27;Saltimbanchi&#x27; were thus those who performed somersaults on a temporary platform—wandering acrobats, performing as buskers in the open air, the platform giving their audience a better view.

==History==
&quot;Saltimbanco&quot; was Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s longest running production when it closed at the end of 2012. In 2011 it was the first show by Cirque du Soleil to be presented in Turkey, and Ukraine, in 2012 the first show in Slovakia and in Amman, Jordan. 
&quot;Saltimbanco&quot;&#x27;s last performance took place in Montreal on December 30, 2012 after 6,000 big top and arena appearances before 14 million spectators in 200 cities worldwide.

==Set and technical information==
&quot;Saltimbanco&quot;&#x27;s set played on opposites and contradictions located within a cityscape. A rosace made of metal rings suspended over the stage allowed light to filter through like leaves on a tree. The lighting was cinematic in effect due to the usage of different colored gels. The facts listed below applied to the arena format of &quot;Saltimbanco&quot;, although some of these were also applicable to the grand chapiteau tour as well.
* The stage was in length and in width.
* The Chinese poles were in height.
* The equipment for the show weighed a total of and was transported and configured by 26 specialty technicians and 12 truck drivers.
* Approximately 140 people were hired locally in each city to set up and load out the show for the arena.

==Cast==
The 51-member performance troupe included multiple musicians, singers, acrobats, and characters. Characters mentioned in the show&#x27;s promotional literature included:

* The Urban Worms
* The Multicolored Worms
* The Cavaliers
* The Baroques
* The Death
* The Ringmaster
* The Baron
* The Dreamer
* The Punks
* The Songbird (La Belle)
* The Blue Gypsy
* The Child
* Eddie
* The Angels

Numerous performers had portrayed the Baron and Eddie over the years, including René Bazinet (1992–1996, 2006), Gordon White (1993–1994), Julien Cottereau (1994–1997, 1998, 2000, 2004-2005), Frédéric Volovitch (1995-1997), Lee Ross (1999–2001), Jesko von den Steinen (2002–2005, 2006), Amo Gulinello (2005–2011), and Martin Pons (2011–2012).

The 1993 Costa Mesa cast of 36 included;

With Miguel Arias, Dimitrii Arnaoutov, Rene Bazinet, Alain Berge, Pawel Biegaj , Witek Biegaj, Martin Boisvert, Jean-Paul Boun, Jenny Clement, Andrea Conway, Vincent Cotnoir, Nicolas Dupere, Joscelyn Drainville, Alain Gauthier, Nui Guishan, Sun Hongli, Miguel Herrera, Galina Karableva, Guy Kaye, Brigitt Larochelle, Isabelle Larose, Jean-Francois Lemieux, Marco Lorador, Paulo Lorador, Daniel Olivier, Francois Dumais, Francine Poitras, Mathieu Roy, Karyne Steben, Sarah Steben, Sonia St-Martin, Zhang Shengli, Anton Tchelnokov, Nikolai Tchelnokov, Neomi Tamelio, Guennadi Tchijov, Huang Zhen.

== Acts ==
The acts in &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; were a mix of traditional circus acts with more modern acts.
*Adagio trio: Three acrobats performed in an adagio that drew inspiration from acrosport.
*Chinese poles: Up to 26 performers performed in this act using four poles in the middle of the stage. They climbed up, dropped down, jumped between, hung from, and even spun on these poles.
* Balancing on canes: A handbalance artist performed feats of strength and various contortion poses, including the Marinelli bend, while balancing on high handstand supports.
*Juggling: A juggler used multiple balls in a display of increasing dexterity.
*Boleadoras: Two performers twirled boleadoras in this unique act. The bolas are a percussion instrument that is hit against the ground to produce a loud popping sound. The act later included the use of the Taiko by one of the performers while the other used the bolas to play a complementary beat.
*Russian swing: Multiple artists jumped off a large swing, performing twists, spins, and flips, before landing on human pyramids, a mat, and other props.
*Solo trapeze: A young artist swung a trapeze incredibly high, whenever the trapeze was swung high the artist would spin up multiple times, and would catch the bar of the trapeze with her legs.
*Hand-to-hand: A duo used an incredible amount of body strength in this act as one would balance in a handstand on the other.
*Bungee: Four aerialists suspended from bungees flipped, swung, and bounced in synchronization with each other.

===Rotational acts===
* Aerial straps: A performer swung on these straps and would use upper body strength to create many dangerous poses.

===Retired acts===
*Tight rope (double wire): An acrobat ascended a wire as two more tightropes, one three feet higher than the other, were revealed. She performed various tricks including flips, spins, and splits. She even backflipped from one rope to the other, and then jumped back. This act was removed from the arena version due to rigging issues.
*Contortion: This act featured four female contortionists from a previous Cirque du Soleil show, &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot;. It replaced the Boleadoras act for several years, but did not continue after the 1998 revival.
*Diabolo: This was a solo diabolo act using Western-style diabolo tricks.
*Vertical rope: This was one of the original &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; acts, a Spanish web act originally performed by the adagio troupe. This act was not seen outside of the North America/Japan tour.
*Manipulation: This act featured three women manipulating ribbons and hoops. It replaced the boleadoras act.
*Artistic bicycle: A bicycle artist wheeled around the stage, all the while playing the guitar, hand balancing, swinging and dancing on wheels.
*Duo trapeze: This act featured two female artists who would swing on a trapeze, one would leap off and would be caught at the last minute by the other performer and be brought back onto the trapeze for the next trick.

==Costumes==
The costumes in &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; were bright and vivid in color to accentuate the dynamism of the urban city. The colors used in the costumes were all primary colors: cyan, yellow, magenta, and green. The Baron, clad in black, red, and white, wore a cape, length-arm gloves, and tights. The Multi-Colored Worms wore jumpsuits that covered everything but their faces. The Urban Worms&#x27;s masks were made of a polyester resin base which was both hypoallergenic and permeable to air.

==Music==

The &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; score was written and composed by René Dupéré, and was released as a studio album on October 9, 1992. The music has a range of musical influences from the classical to the modern.

The original soundtrack features the vocal work of Canadian vocalist Francine Poitras. In 2005, Cirque du Soleil re-recorded and released the soundtrack to update its music. Some songs were completely re-recorded, while others had new instrumentation added and included Poitras&#x27;s original vocal track. Additional and new vocals were provided by Laurence Janot, a French singer who was touring with the show at the time. Every track was slightly edited in some form from the original CD.

Several other limited editions of the album have been released. In 2001 Cirque du Soleil Musique released a limited edition of the original 1992 soundtrack featuring two additional tracks, &quot;Arlequin&quot; and &quot;Adagio&quot; (performed by Laur Fugere). Another limited edition of the CD, &quot;Saltimbanco Live in Amsterdam&quot;, was created and distributed exclusively to staff members of &quot;Saltimbanco&quot;. The employee special edition features a live, in-house recording of an entire performance and is considered a collector&#x27;s item.

Below is the list of tracks featured in the 2005 re-release of the album and alongside are the acts during which each song was performed.

==Filmography==

===Saltimbanco&#x27;s Diary===

===Cirque du Soleil Presents: Saltimbanco===
The show was filmed and released as a 78-minute VHS in 1994, though the show&#x27;s acts continued to change significantly after it was filmed.

===Saltimbanco 20 ans Pour Toujours / Forever 20===
In 2012, just before the show&#x27;s retirement, a behind-the-scenes documentary was filmed, titled &quot;Saltimbanco Forever 20&quot; (directed by Eric Chaussé; director of photography: Miguel Henriques; editor: Julie Bouffard). This documentary has thus far remained unreleased, although a short clip was leaked in October 2013. In 2014 another excerpt was leaked featuring an interview with boleadoras performer Adriana Pegueroles; another clip, about the show&#x27;s music, was published in 2019.

==Tour==
&quot;Saltimbanco&quot; toured around the world several times during its original 14-year tour under the Grand Chapiteau. It played its final show in the Royal Albert Hall in London on 1 February 1997. &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; was revived the following year on 14 October 1998, and went on to tour the Asia-Pacific region. The show played for another nine years, becoming the first Cirque du Soleil show to tour South America, with visits to Santiago, Chile (March 2006); Buenos Aires, Argentina (May 2006); and São Paulo (August 2006) and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (October 2006). That tour&#x27;s final performance took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 10 December 2006.

Following its closure in December 2006, &quot;Saltimbanco&quot; was configured into an arena show format, and re-launched in July 2007 to commence an extensive North American tour, visiting cities and areas that Cirque du Soleil had previously been unable to visit. The tour started in London, Ontario and subsequently toured Canada and the United States. &quot;Saltimbanco&quot;’s three-year tour of North America ended in Columbus, Ohio. In 2009 the show embarked on its third tour of Europe. Between 2011 and 2012, it visited over 50 cities in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Eastern Europe, and North America.

&quot;Saltimbanco&quot;&#x27;s final performance took place in Montreal on 30 December 2012.

<text>Adam Heinrich Müller (30 June 1779 – 17 January 1829; after 1827 [[Ritter]] von Nitterdorf) was a German-Austrian conservative philosopher, literary critic, and political economist, working within the romantic tradition.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Müller was born in Berlin. It was intended that he should study Protestant theology, but from 1798 he devoted himself in Göttingen to the study of law, philosophy, and natural science. He was a student of Gustav Hugo. Returning to Berlin, he was persuaded by his friend Friedrich von Gentz to take up political science. He had early formed a close intimacy with Gentz, his elder by 15 years; and this connection exercised an important influence both on his material circumstances and his mental development in after life. The two men differed widely in character and in their fundamental principles, but agreed, at least in their later period, in their practical political aims, and the friendship was only terminated by death.

Müller worked for some time as referendary in the &quot;Kurmärkische Kammer&quot; in Berlin. Müller&#x27;s relations with the Junker party and his co-operation with them in their opposition to Hardenberg&#x27;s reforms made any public employment in Prussia impossible for him. He travelled in Sweden and Denmark, spent about two years in Poland, and then went to Vienna, where he was converted to the Catholic faith on 30 April 1805. Through Gentz he became acquainted with Metternich, to whom he was useful in the preparation of state papers.

Via Poland, Müller traveled to Dresden, where he held lectures on German science and literature (1806), in which he showed himself to be a follower of Schlegel&#x27;s romanticism.

===Career===
From 1806 to 1809, he lived at Dresden occupied in the political education of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and lecturer on German literature, dramatic art, and political science. In 1808 he edited with Heinrich von Kleist the periodical &quot;Phoebus&quot;. In 1809, he returned to Berlin, and in 1811 to Vienna, where he lived in the house of Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este and became the friend of Clemens Maria Hofbauer.

He developed his central political ideas in his 1808/09 lectures, which he published in 1809 under the title &quot;The Elements of Statecraft&quot;. In accordance with his motto that the &quot;state scholar&quot; must stand by the statesman, Müller propagated the basic ideas of political romanticism, of which the elements are to be regarded as the main work: he opposed the modern contract theory to the idea of the organically grown monarchical corporate state, combining tradition and the present; against the modern economic theory of Adam Smith (whom Müller hated throughout his life), he propagated the idea of a strict social bond of property. Even later he repeatedly criticized modern economic life. His admired as well as hostile definition of the state is: The state is not a &quot;manufactory ... or mercantile society, it is the most intimate connection of all physical and spiritual needs, all physical and spiritual wealth, all inner and outer life nation, into a great, energetic, infinitely moving and living whole.&quot;

In 1809, after marrying Sophie von Haza-Radlitz, Müller went to Berlin, where he gave further historical-political lectures and published articles in the &quot;Berliner Abendblatt&quot; newspaper (1810/11) edited by Heinrich von Kleist. Müller, now back in the Prussian civil service, rejected the reform efforts of Karl August von Hardenberg, the state chancellor who had been in office since 1810, and tried to trigger a public discussion about the reform policy with his articles critical of the government. In 1811 he also acted as a close political adviser to the leader of the Prussian nobility opposition, Friedrich August Ludwig von der Marwitz. But Hardenberg smashed the opposition: Marwitz was imprisoned, the “Abendblatt” had to cease publication and Müller was deported to Vienna as a diplomatic reporter.

Driven back to Berlin by the war, Müller drafted a bill of indictment against the state chancellor von Hardenberg on behalf of the Kurbrandenburgische Ritterschaft after the latter had refused Müller&#x27;s request for employment in the civil service. In this indictment, intended for the king, he accused the chancellor of revolutionary principles.

In 1813, he entered the Austrian service, and was appointed imperial commissioner and major of the rifle corps in Tyrol. He took part in the wars for liberation, and later on, as counsellor of the government, in the reorganization of the country. In 1815 he was called to Vienna, and went to Paris with the imperial staff.

On the conclusion of peace, he became Austrian consul-general for Saxony at Leipzig, and agent for Anhalt and Schwarzburg. He edited here the periodicals &quot;Deutscher Staatsanzeiger&quot; (1816–1818) and &quot;Unparteiischer Literatur- und Kirchenkorrespondent&quot;. He attended the ministerial conferences at Carlsbad and Vienna (1819–1820), where, being one of the principal literary instruments of the reaction, he took part in framing the Carlsbad resolutions. In 1826, at the instance of Prince von Metternich, he was ennobled as Ritter von Nittersdorf, was recalled to Vienna (1827), appointed imperial counsellor, and employed in the service of the chancellery. He died in Vienna in 1829, aged 49.

==Positions and theories==
Müller was distinguished as a writer not only on politics and economics, but on literature and aesthetics.

His chief work is the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Elements of Statecraft&quot;), originating in lectures delivered before Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and an assembly of politicians and diplomats at Dresden in the winter, 1808–09. It treats in six books of the state, of right, of the spirit of legislation in antiquity and in the Middle Ages, of money and national wealth, of the economical factors of the state and trade, of the relation between the state and religion.

Müller was a conservative writer whose vision of the state was one of an absolute power, in contrast to theorists who emphasized the rights of man such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Müller endeavoured to comprehend the connection between political and social science, and, while using the historical method, to base them upon philosophy and religion. With Edmund Burke, Friedrich von Gentz, Joseph de Maistre, and Karl Ludwig von Haller, he must be reckoned among the chief opponents of revolutionary ideas in politics.

In his work, &#x27; (&quot;On the necessity of a comprehensive theological foundation for political science&quot;, 1820), Müller rejects, like Haller (&#x27;, 1816), the distinction between constitutional and civil law (common law), which rests entirely on the idea of the state&#x27;s omnipotence. His ideal is medieval feudalism, on which the reorganization of modern political institutions should be modelled.

===Romanticism===
In the field of literature and aesthetics, Müller belongs to the Romantic school. He is a Romanticist even in his specialty, politics and political economy. As Eichendorff says in his &quot;Geschichte der poetischen Literatur Deutschlands&quot; (new ed., by W. Kosch, Kempten, 1906, p. 352), Müller &quot;mapped out a domain of his own, the application of Romanticism to the social and political conditions of life.&quot; Carl Schmitt presented the view that &quot;it is impossible to judge Müller&#x27;s theory of the state as anything but a matter of aesthetics and style.&quot; Müller himself declares: &quot;The reconciliation of science and art and of their noblest ideas with serious political life was the purpose of my larger works&quot; (&quot;Vermischte Schriften&quot;, I, p. iii).

===Economics===
His position in political economy is defined by his strong opposition to Adam Smith&#x27;s system of materialistic-liberal (so-called classical) political economy, or the so-called industry system. He censures Smith as presenting a one-sidedly material and individualistic conception of society, and as being too exclusively English in his views. Müller opposed free trade and strongly supported autarky. In contrast with the economical individualism of Adam Smith, he emphasizes the ethical element in national economy, the duty of the state toward the individual, and the religious basis which is also necessary in this field. Müller&#x27;s importance in the history of political economy is acknowledged even by the opponents of his religious and political point of view. His reaction against Adam Smith, says Roscher (&quot;Geschichte der National-Ökonomik&quot;, p. 763), &quot;is not blind or hostile, but is important, and often truly helpful.&quot; Some of his ideas, freed from much of their alloy, are reproduced in the writings of the historical school of German economists.

One of Müller&#x27;s main contributions to economic theory was his book &quot;Versuch einer neuen Theorie des Geldes&quot; (Attempt at a New Theory of Money), published in 1816. In this book, Müller defended paper money over metallic money, on the grounds that the &quot;word&quot; or stamp is what gives something a status as money, not the value of the material of which it is composed. Müller called this legitimating word or stamp &quot;ideal money&quot;, and believed it to be the &quot;&#x27;condition of possibility&#x27; of money as such&quot;.

The reactionary and feudalistic thought in Müller&#x27;s writings, which agreed so little with the spirit of the times, prevented his political ideas from exerting a more notable and lasting influence on his age, while their religious character prevented them from being justly appreciated. However, Müller&#x27;s teachings had long-term effects in that they were taken up again by 20th century theorists of corporatism and the corporate state, for example Othmar Spann (&quot;Der wahre Staat. Vorlesungen über Abbruch und Neubau der Gesellschaft&quot;, Vienna, 1921).

==Writings==
Müller is the main representative of political romanticism. His work is predominantly characterized by an enlightened-romantic mixed style, which proves to be particularly fruitful in his economic-theoretical writing &quot;Elements of Statecraft .&quot; In it, he examines the intellectual foundations of economically developed nations, how they can use their wealth to benefit all classes of society and create a just world order. Central to this is his criticism of liberalism and the writings of Adam Smith. Philosophically, Müller starts from his theory of opposites - a kind of early dialectic view that revolves around the idea of mediation and balance.

Müller was a man of great and versatile talents, an excellent orator, and a suggestive writer. Several of his works were based upon his own lectures; the most important (besides the above-mentioned periodicals) are:

*&quot;Die Lehre vom Gegensatz&quot; (&quot;The Doctrine of Contrasts,&quot; Berlin, 1804)
*&quot;Vorlesungen über die deutsche Wissenschaft und Literatur&quot; (&quot;Lectures on German science and literature,&quot; Dresden, 1806, 2nd ed., 1807)
*&quot;Von der Idee der Schönheit&quot; (&quot;On the idea of beauty,&quot; lectures; Berlin, 1809)
*&quot;Die Elemente der Staatskunst&quot; (&quot;The Elements of Statecraft,&quot; lectures; 3 parts, Berlin, 1809)
*&quot;Über König Friedrich II. und die Natur, Würde und Bestimmung der preußischen Monarchie&quot; (lectures; Berlin, 1810)
*&quot;Die Theorie der Staatshaushaltung und ihre Forschritte in Deutschland und England seit Adam Smith&quot; (&quot;The theory of state budgeting,&quot; 2 vols., Vienna, 1812)
*&quot;Vermischte Schriften über Staat, Philosophie und Kunst&quot; (2 vols., Vienna, 1812; 2nd ed., 1817)
*&quot;Versuch einer neuen Theorie des Geldes, mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Großbritannien&quot; (&quot;Attempt at a new theory of money,&quot; Leipzig, 1816)
*&quot;Zwölf Reden über die Beredsamkeit und deren Verfall in Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Twelve speeches on eloquence and its decline in Germany,&quot; Leipzig, 1817)
*&quot;Die Fortschritte der nationalökonomischen Wissenschaft in England&quot; (Leipzig, 1817)
*&quot;Von der Notwendigkeit einer theologischen Grundlage der gesamten Staatswissenschaften und der Staatswirtschaft insbesondere&quot; (&quot;Of the need for a theological basis for all political science,&quot; Leipzig, 1820; new ed., Vienna, 1898)
*&quot;Die Gewerbe-Polizei in Beziehung auf den Landbau&quot; (Leipzig, 1824)
*&quot;Vorschlag zu einem historischen Ferien-Cursus&quot; (Vienna, 1829)

A critical pamphlet, which was written in 1817 on the occasion of the Protestant jubilee of the Reformation and entitled, &quot;Etwas, das Goethe gesagt hat. Beleuchtet von Adam Müller. Leipzig, den 31 Oktober 1817&quot;, was printed but not published (reprinted in Vienna, 1910). Nevertheless, Traugott Krug&#x27;s reply, entitled &quot;Etwas, das Herr Adam Müller gesagt hat über etwas, das Goethe gesagt hat, und noch etwas, das Luther gesagt hat&quot; (Leipzig, 1817), appeared in two editions.

<doc id="1267281" wikidata="Q2193185" url="?curid=1267281" title="Alegría (Cirque du Soleil)">
<text>Alegría is a Cirque du Soleil touring production, created in 1994 by director Franco Dragone and director of creation Gilles Ste-Croix. It takes its name from the Spanish word for &quot;joy&quot;.

Since April 1994 the show has been performed over 5000 times, and has been seen by over 14 million spectators in more than 250 cities around the world.


==Set and technical information==
The stage of &quot;Alegría&quot; is topped by a giant dome and decorated with stylistic columns and balustrades. The dome gives the sense of an impressive, powerful structure, similar to how churches and government buildings utilize similar architectural constructs. The stage has spiral ramps on opposing sides which lead down, symbolizing the unknown. The floor of the stage has the head of a salamander, used for the four elements in which it lives. The 17th-century-ballroom stylistic lighting design reflects a nostalgic atmosphere. Finally, an autumnal color palette creates the luminous obscurity of the show.

==Characters==
The characters in &quot;Alegría&quot; comprise people of two separate generations: the New Order and the Old Order.

*Fleur: An unpredictable and dangerous madman who believes he is king. He is the guide to the world of &quot;Alegría&quot;.
*Nostalgic Old Birds: The Nostalgic Old Birds have lived in the palace for as long as it has existed. They are empty-shelled courtiers who admire their reflections in mirrorless frames. They include Gracieuse, Blanche, Valentin, Wilfrid, Georges-Etienne and more.
*Fire Bird: He appears for a brief dance before fire knife act and is present in the background while the fire knife dancer is performing.
*Tamir and Little Tamir: Appears when needed, only to disappear once he has fulfilled his mission.
*The Musicians: They provide the show&#x27;s live music, dressed entirely in white. In the first run of the show, they were sometimes referred to as &quot;Les Hiboux&quot; (&quot;the Owls&quot;).
*Nymphs: Exuberant characters who celebrate life.
*Bronx: The young and tough, who are the next generation in &quot;Alegría&quot;. They perform on the power track and aerial high bar.
*The Angels: The guardians who are the youth of tomorrow. They perform on the Russian bars.
*White Singer: One of the singers. She is the storyteller who sings about everything she sees around her. She is often desired by the male characters of the show.
*Black Singer: One of the singers. She has a wickedness about her and is the White Singer&#x27;s opposite. She always avoids approaching the front of the stage.
*Clowns: Reflecting the eternal spirit of mankind, the clowns are witnesses to the passing of centuries, the social commentators of the world of Alegría. Grounded in real life, they tell little stories of everyday existence where everyone is a hero, and where anyone can fall in love and suffer a broken heart. The clowns are visionaries - philosophers of absurdity. Endearing, comical and childlike, they turn the world into a circus.

==Costumes==

&quot;Alegría&#x27;s&quot; costumes have a dichotomy relating to the Old Order and the New Order. The Old Order has costumes which are reminiscent of New York&#x27;s Gilded Age as they are finely decorated with feathers, lace, and other adornments. The New Order, on the other hand, representing the youth of tomorrow, have the same rich hues as the old order, while the fabrics used are lighter and softer, helping to emphasize the agility of youth.

==Music==

<text>Gerard Thurston Warren (born July 25, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for eleven seasons. He played college football for the University of Florida. He was selected by the Cleveland Browns third overall in the 2001 NFL draft, and also played professionally for the Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots of the NFL.

== Early life ==

Warren was born in Lake City, Florida. He attended Union County High School in Lake Butler, Florida, where he played for the Union County Tigers high school football team. He finished his high school career with 36 sacks, and was ranked among the top ten defensive linemen nationally. During his four years in high school, the Union County High School Tigers had an overall win–loss record of 49–4 and won three consecutive Florida Class 3A state championships in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Warren was named to the Prep Stars and &quot;USA Today&quot; high school All-America teams. In 2007, ten years after he graduated from high school, the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) recognized Warren as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Players of the First 100 Years&quot; of Florida high school football.

== College career ==

Warren attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier&#x27;s Florida Gators football team from 1998 to 2000. As a junior team captain in 2000, Warren posted 76 tackles and 4.5 quarterback sacks at defensive tackle and was a second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection and a second-team All-American. He finished his three-season career as a Gator with 159 tackles, 9.5 sacks, and 30 tackles for a loss in 35 games and 22 starts.

== Professional career ==

=== Cleveland Browns ===

Warren was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the third overall selection in the 2001 NFL draft. He played in 15 games as a rookie in 2001, all starts, and finished with 61 tackles and five sacks. In 2002, Warren started all 16 games, recording 40 tackles, two sacks, and two forced fumbles. He started 15 games for the Browns in 2003, picking up 32 tackles and a career-high 5.5 sacks. In his final season in Cleveland, 2004, Warren played in and started 13 games, missing three to injury, and finished with 19 tackles and four sacks.

=== Denver Broncos ===

In March 2005, Warren was traded to the Denver Broncos for a fourth-round pick in the 2005 NFL draft. In addition to Warren, the Broncos also acquired defensive linemen Michael Myers, Ebenezer Ekuban, and Courtney Brown from the Browns, leading some to dub the new Broncos defensive line the &quot;Browncos.&quot; Warren finished the 2005 season with 42 tackles and three sacks in 16 starts. In 2006, Warren started 15 games and recorded 30 tackles and 2.5 sacks on the season.

=== Oakland Raiders ===

In August 2007, during the preseason, Warren was traded by the Broncos to the Oakland Raiders in exchange for a conditional fifth-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft. In 2007, Warren played in 12 games (five starts) for the Raiders, posting 22 tackles, four sacks, and one forced fumble. Warren started all 16 games in the 2008 season, finishing with 39 tackles, four sacks, and one forced fumble. In his final season with the Raiders, 2009, Warren again started all 16 games and finished the year with 35 tackles and two sacks. He was released by the Raiders on March 11, 2010.

=== New England Patriots ===

On April 24, 2010, during the final day of the 2010 NFL draft, Warren signed with the New England Patriots. Despite being a late free agent signing, Warren made the Patriots&#x27; roster and began the season as a starter at defensive end before moving to nose tackle in Week 6. After two games at nose tackle, Warren moved back to defensive end but did not start the team&#x27;s Week 8 game against the Minnesota Vikings. He returned to the starting lineup in Week 12 against the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving Day, and went on to start four of the team&#x27;s final five games after Thanksgiving. Warren finished the regular season with 28 tackles and 3.5 sacks in 16 games (10 starts). The Patriots re-signed him on August 8, 2011, after he had been a free agent for most of the offseason. During the 2011 season, he played in eleven games, all off the bench, and compiled a sack and 15 tackles. Afterward, he again became a free agent, but he re-signed with the Patriots on April 30, 2012. He was again released on August 26, 2012.

<doc id="1267288" wikidata="Q1305766" url="?curid=1267288" title="Poincaré–Hopf theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Poincaré–Hopf theorem (also known as the Poincaré–Hopf index formula, Poincaré–Hopf index theorem, or Hopf index theorem) is an important theorem that is used in differential topology. It is named after Henri Poincaré and Heinz Hopf.

The Poincaré–Hopf theorem is often 
illustrated by the special case of the hairy ball theorem, which simply states that there is no smooth vector field on an even-dimensional n-sphere having no sources or sinks.

==Formal statement==

Let formula_1 be a differentiable manifold, of dimension formula_2, and formula_3 a vector field on formula_1. Suppose that formula_5 is an isolated zero of formula_3, and fix some local coordinates near formula_5. Pick a closed ball formula_8 centered at formula_5, so that formula_5 is the only zero of formula_3 in formula_8. Then the index of formula_3 at formula_5, formula_15, can be defined as the degree of the map formula_16 from the boundary of formula_8 to the formula_18-sphere given by formula_19.

Theorem. Let formula_1 be a compact differentiable manifold. Let formula_3 be a vector field on formula_1 with isolated zeroes. If formula_1 has boundary, then we insist that formula_3 be pointing in the outward normal direction along the boundary. Then we have the formula

:formula_25

where the sum of the indices is over all the isolated zeroes of formula_3 and formula_27 is the Euler characteristic of formula_1. A particularly useful corollary is when there is a non-vanishing vector field implying Euler characteristic 0.

The theorem was proven for two dimensions by Henri Poincaré and later generalized to higher dimensions by Heinz Hopf. 

==Significance==
The Euler characteristic of a closed surface is a purely topological concept, whereas the index of a vector field is purely analytic. Thus, this theorem establishes a deep link between two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics. It is perhaps as interesting that the proof of this theorem relies heavily on integration, and, in particular, Stokes&#x27; theorem, which states that the integral of the exterior derivative of a differential form is equal to the integral of that form over the boundary. In the special case of a manifold without boundary, this amounts to saying that the integral is 0. But by examining vector fields in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a source or sink, we see that sources and sinks contribute integer amounts (known as the index) to the total, and they must all sum to 0. This result may be considered one of the earliest of a whole series of theorems (e.g. Atiyah–Singer index theorem, De Rham&#x27;s theorem, Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem) establishing deep relationships between geometric and analytical or physical concepts. They play an important role in the modern study of both fields.

==Sketch of proof==
# Embed &quot;M&quot; in some high-dimensional Euclidean space. (Use the Whitney embedding theorem.)
# Take a small neighborhood of &quot;M&quot; in that Euclidean space, &quot;N&quot;ε. Extend the vector field to this neighborhood so that it still has the same zeroes and the zeroes have the same indices. In addition, make sure that the extended vector field at the boundary of &quot;N&quot;ε is directed outwards.
# The sum of indices of the zeroes of the old (and new) vector field is equal to the degree of the Gauss map from the boundary of &quot;N&quot;ε to the sphere. Thus, the sum of the indices is independent of the actual vector field, and depends only on the manifold &quot;M&quot;. Technique: cut away all zeroes of the vector field with small neighborhoods. Then use the fact that the degree of a map from the boundary of an n-dimensional manifold to an sphere, that can be extended to the whole n-dimensional manifold, is zero.
# Finally, identify this sum of indices as the Euler characteristic of &quot;M&quot;. To do that, construct a very specific vector field on &quot;M&quot; using a triangulation of &quot;M&quot; for which it is clear that the sum of indices is equal to the Euler characteristic.

== Generalization ==
It is still possible to define the index for a vector field with nonisolated zeroes. A construction of this index and the extension of Poincaré–Hopf theorem for vector fields with nonisolated zeroes is outlined in Section 1.1.2 of .

Another generalization that use only compact triangulable space and continuous mappings with finitely many fixed points is Lefschetz-Hopf theorem.
Since every vector field induce flow on manifold and fixed points of small flows corresponds to zeroes of vector field (and indices of zeroes equals indices of fixed points), then Poincare-Hopf theorem follows immediately from it.

<doc id="1267289" wikidata="Q2058860" url="?curid=1267289" title="Dralion">
<text>Dralion (pronounced Drah-lee-on) was a touring production by the Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil. The show combined elements of traditional Chinese circus with Western contemporary circus, complementing the &quot;East-meets-West&quot; theme implied in the title—the name is a portmanteau of &quot;dragon&quot; (representing the East) and &quot;lion&quot; (representing the West). It is Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s twelfth touring production and the first Cirque show since 1985 not to be directed by Franco Dragone. &quot;Dralion&quot; performed its final show at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, Alaska on January 18, 2015, bringing its fifteen-year world tour to a close.

== Set and technical information ==
The backdrop for &quot;Dralion&quot; was a metallic structure in width and in height. It was covered in perforated aluminum tiles, giving it the appearance of medieval armor or a futuristic Chinese temple. Sitting atop the structure were six giant claws which allow performers to climb the wall and suspend in mid-air. Above the stage itself were three large concentric aluminum rings. The first was utilized as a catwalk; the second was used to support acrobatic equipment; and the third is used by performers to move up and down and suspend in the air.

Portions of the Dralion stage were redesigned and incorporated into the Ovo arena tour in early 2016.

==Characters==
&quot;Dralion&quot; featured 50 members in its performance troupe, of which about 5 or 6 play principal characters.
*Azala (air): The goddess of air who is dressed in blue, keeper of the sun and the guardian of immortality.
*Gaya (earth): The goddess of earth, dressed in ochre.
*Océane (water): The goddess of water, dressed in green.
*Yao (fire): The god of fire, dressed in red, who is both good and evil.
*L&#x27;Âme Force: The show&#x27;s singers who symbolize harmony between the four elements.
*Kala: Represents the heart of the wheel of time, making time evolve.
*King Bamboo: Represents the force of Fire.
*Hibana: A Fire Princess.
*Little Buddha: The chosen child who possesses powers that will eventually allow him to become an Âme-Force, but dreams of being a regular child.
*Shine: The lover of the air goddess Azala.
*Dralions: Mythical creatures inspired by the imagery of the Chinese lion dance and dragon dance. (performed by members of Chinese house troupe) 
*Water Nymphs: A group of young girls dress in green, they follow the order of Océane.
*Giovanni: A small but nimble man.
*Giovanna: A female version of Giovanni portrayed by Jessica Green. (2003)
*The Clowns: The original clowns of Dralion consisting of Robert Jetté, Ben Amar-Djalal, Aline Muheim, and Philippe Delaitre. (1999)
*Les Voila: A duo of bizarre clowns consisting of Johnny Filion and Soizick Hebert. (1999-2001)
*The Mad Italian Waiters: Two clowns consisting of the obese and pompous Vincenti, and the absent minded Alberti. (2001-2015)

==Acts==
The acts of &quot;Dralion&quot; combine unique western and eastern acrobatic skills.

*Dance of the Elements: The show began with the goddesses and god of the four elements dancing.
*Single Handbalancing: A single woman balances on one hand and accomplishes a variety of poses.
*Bamboo Poles: Five acrobats twirl and throw bamboo poles while Yao waves a flag as the acrobats jump over it.
*Juggling: An artist performs juggling infused with breakdancing and modern dance. This act was performed by Viktor Kee but now is performed by Vladik Myagkostoupov.
*Trampoline: Surrounding Océane, a group of acrobats perform on trampolines using the set&#x27;s futuristic backdrop both as a diving board and landing pad.
*Crossed Cyr Wheel: A cyr wheel that is infused with another cyr wheel forming a globe. The performer spins and twists this apparatus in an act that represents the circle of life and the passing of time.
*Dralions: Three acrobats and three Dralions perform tumbling feats and Chinese lion dance-like dance.
*Medusa: A group of artists execute graceful and lithe movements, in the style of acrosport.
*Aerial Hoop: A single artist performs choreography using a hoop suspended in mid-air.
*Diabolo: Artists perform tricks with diabolos trying to outperform each other.

*Hoop Diving: Acrobats jump through a tower of hoops, which is sometimes spinning.
*Skipping Ropes: A group of acrobats perform jump rope alone or together in pyramids and in towers.

===Rotation acts===
*Contortion: A solo act featuring a very flexible performer who stays in handstands with their legs over their head.
*Aerial Straps: Used commonly in place of Aerial Pas de Deux.

===Retired acts===
*Contortion with Bowls: This was a contortion act made even more precarious with the added difficulty of balancing a stack of bowls on the artists head.
*Teeterboard: An original Dralion act, it featured an all female troupe. The flyer would stand at one end of the trapeze as two performers jumped onto the opposite end, shooting the flyer up and onto a high tower of other performers.
*Ballet on Lightbulbs: An original Dralion act that was unlike anything else. A group of female artists wore ballet pointe shoes and balanced while other performers climbed onto their shoulders creating high towers of people all on a platform of light bulbs.
*Double Duplex Trapeze: An original Dralion act, two trapezes that had one bar at the bottom and another bar about a metre above it, the artists would jump or flip from the higher bar into the hands of another performer at the bottom bar.
*Foot Juggling: An original Dralion act, this foot juggling act featured a female artist who manipulated and spun an open Chinese parasol on her feet, at one moment she would have a parasol on each foot and each hand, all spinning simultaneously. 
*Balancing on Chairs: This act had an artist stack a pile if chairs, at the top of the pile the artist performed a hand-balancing act.
*Spirits: Four couples perform a gravity-defying ballet.

==Costumes==
&quot;Dralion&quot;&#x27;s costumes are vibrant in color; inspired by clothing from India, China, and Africa; and are shaped according to the movements of each performer&#x27;s choreography. In total there are around 1500 wardrobe pieces for the show, taking into account that some artists have up to four costume changes during a single performance.

* Yao: As the symbol of fire, Yao is clad in red and inspired by Chinese.
* Océane: As the goddess of water, Océane&#x27;s costume is Indian inspired and green in color.
* Azala: As the goddess of air, Azala&#x27;s primary color is blue. Her dress is fashioned with Asian crystal beads.
* Gaya: As the goddess of earth, Gaya&#x27;s color is Ochre. Her costume is inspired by African designs.
* L&#x27;Âme Force: The texture on the front of their golden costumes is made by moulding small plastic soldiers.
* Dralions: The dralions are constructed from a mélange of items both natural and synthetic: lycra, leather, silk, mosquito netting, polystyrene foam, springs, raffia, horse hair, emu feathers, and other fabrics and decorations.

==Music==
With the company&#x27;s departure from its longtime creative team, &quot;Dralion&quot; features the work of a new Cirque composer, French-Canadian composer Violaine Corradi. The music of &quot;Dralion&quot; aims to be a fusion of sounds from East and West by the use of acoustic and electric instruments. Featuring rhythmic and lyrical motifs, the influences range from Indian melodies to sounds from Andalusia, Africa, Central Europe, and the West. Instruments used in the CD are drums, violin, winds, keyboards, guitar and percussion instructions. Released on November 9, 1999, &quot;Dralion&quot;’s soundtrack features the vocals of Basque counter-tenor Erik Karol, and Canadian female vocalist Agnès Sohier.

<text>Lee Ernest Suggs Jr. (born August 11, 1980) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Virginia Tech Hokies before playing in the NFL for the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins.

==Early life==
Suggs attended high school at William Fleming High School. During his 1998 senior year in high school, he rushed for 2,918 yards and 30 touchdowns, capping a prolific high school career and helping boost his ranking among running backs to fourth in the state and 19th in the nation, according to the SuperPrep scouting organization.

==College career==
While at Virginia Tech he set, and still holds the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) records for most games scoring a touchdown in a single season (14 games in 2002), and for most consecutive games scoring a touchdown (27 consecutive games, from September 2, 2000, through December 31, 2002; 54 touchdowns). Suggs also holds school records for rushing touchdowns in a season (27) and rushing touchdowns in a career (53). His accomplishments at the university earned him a spot in the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
===Cleveland Browns===
Suggs was selected by the Cleveland Browns with the 18th pick in the fourth round and 115th overall of the 2003 NFL draft. In Week 17 of the 2003 season, Suggs rushed for 186 yards on 26 carries for two touchdowns against the Cincinnati Bengals to help the Browns finish with a 22–14 victory. One of his touchdown runs that day went 78 yards long. In 2004, Suggs had his best year as a pro, gaining 922 yards from scrimmage in only 10 games. He was unable to play a full season due to several injuries as well as the acquisition of Reuben Droughns. On August 14, 2006, Suggs was traded to the New York Jets for defensive back Derrick Strait, but the trade was voided when Suggs failed his physical, and returned to the Browns. He was subsequently cut by the Browns.

===Miami Dolphins===
Suggs was claimed off waivers by the Miami Dolphins on September 3, 2006. He was released by the Dolphins on October 10, 2006.

==Coaching career==
Suggs is currently the running back coach at the Catholic University of America. He began his coaching career at Oberlin College as running backs coach in 2008.

<doc id="1267292" wikidata="Q1474715" url="?curid=1267292" title="Funky Monks">
<text>Funky Monks is a 1991 documentary (also the title of a song from the 1991 album &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;) about the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers and the recording of their highly successful 1991 Warner Bros. debut &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. The album was produced by Rick Rubin and recorded in The Mansion, a supposedly haunted house which Rubin now owns. The 60-minute documentary, which was filmed in black-and-white, features footage of the band recording many of the tracks that made the album, and tracks that didn&#x27;t make the album although would be released as singles and b-sides (such as &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot;, &quot;Sikamikanico&quot; and an Iggy &amp; the Stooges cover &quot;Search And Destroy&quot;). It also features interviews from each member of the band, as well as Rick Rubin and the band&#x27;s former and longtime manager, Lindy Goetz. Footage from the documentary was compiled for use in the &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot; music video, which was released in 1992. &quot;Funky Monks&quot; was originally released on VHS but was re-released on DVD. It was filmed and directed by Gavin Bowden.

On July 16, 2011, &quot;NME&quot; voted &quot;Funky Monks&quot; the 14th must see rock documentary on their 20 must see rock documentaries list.

The release was certified gold by the RIAA.

==Unreleased version, bonus footage==
In 2013, a first edit cut of the documentary containing over 18 minutes of footage not included in the released version was released onto YouTube. The newly released footage includes scenes of the band recording &quot;They&#x27;re Red Hot&quot;, &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;, &quot;Sikamikanico&quot; and &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot;. Some of the footage is extended from the released version.

It has been widely believed for years a 3-hour cut of the documentary exists. Footage not from the released documentary has been used in other forms of media such as television interviews and documentaries on the band. Rare color footage was also used at the time for various interviews including ones with MTV. 
A VH-1 documentary contained unseen footage featuring an unreleased song from the &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; recording sessions that has yet to be identified.

<doc id="1267297" wikidata="Q468351" url="?curid=1267297" title="Axel Fredrik Cronstedt">
<text>Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (&quot;/kroonstet/&quot; 23 December 1722 – 19 August 1765) was a Swedish mineralogist and chemist who discovered the element nickel in 1751 as a mining expert with the Bureau of Mines. 
Cronstedt is considered a founder of modern mineralogy, for introducing the blowpipe as a tool for mineralogists, and for proposing that the mineral kingdom be organized on the basis of chemical analysis in his book &quot;Försök til mineralogie, eller mineral-rikets upställning&quot; (“An attempt at mineralogy or arrangement of the Mineral Kingdom”, 1758).

==Life==
Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was born on 23 December 1722 on the estate of Ströpsta, in Sudermania.
His father, Gabriel Olderman Cronstedt (1670–1757), was a military engineer.
His mother, Maria Elizabeth Adlersberg, was Gabriel Cronstedt&#x27;s second wife.

Beginning in 1738, Axel Cronstedt was an unregistered student at the University of Uppsala, hearing lectures with Johan Gottschalk Wallerius (1709–1785), professor of chemistry, and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744). At Uppsala, he became a friend of Sven Rinman, discoverer of Rinman&#x27;s green. 
In 1743, during an unstable period politically, Cronstedt left Uppsala to act as his father&#x27;s secretary on a military tour of inspection. This tour strengthened his interest in mines and mineralogy.

Cronstedt entered the School of Mines where his instructors included geologist Daniel Tilas (1712-1772). On Tilas&#x27; recommendation, Cronstedt went on mining tours in the summers of 1744 and 1745. In 1746, he surveyed copper mines.
From 1746 to 1748 Cronstedt took classes with George Brandt, the discoverer of cobalt, at the royal mining laboratory in Stockholm, the Laboratorium Chemicum. There he studied chemical analysis and smelting.

Between 1748, when he completed his studies, and 1758, Cronstedt held a variety of positions. In 1756, he was disappointed to be passed over for a position at the Bureau of Mines, but in 1758, he became a superintendent of mining operations for the mining districts of Öster and Västerbergslagen.

In 1760 Cronstedt married Gertrud Charlotta Söderhielm (1728–1769). In 1761, he moved to the estate of Nisshyttan, close to Säter. He died there on 19 August 1765.

==Research==

Cronstedt initiated the use of the blowpipe for the analysis of minerals. Originally a goldsmith&#x27;s tool, it became widely used for the identification of small ore samples, particularly in Sweden where his contemporaries had seen Cronstedt use it. Use of the blowpipe enabled mineralogists to discover eleven new elements, beginning with Cronstedt&#x27;s discovery of nickel.
John Joseph Griffin credits Cronstedt as &quot;the first person of eminence who used the blowpipe&quot; and &quot;the founder of Mineralogy&quot; in &quot;A Practical Treatise on the Use of the Blowpipe&quot; (1827).
Cronstedt discovered the mineral now known as scheelite in 1751 at Bispberg Klack, later obtaining samples from the Kuhschacht mine in Freiberg, Germany. He gave it the name tungsten, meaning &quot;heavy stone&quot; in Swedish. Thirty years later, Carl Wilhelm Scheele determined that scheelite was in fact an ore, and that a new metal could be extracted from it. This element then became known by Cronstedt&#x27;s name, tungsten.

Cronstedt also extracted the element nickel from ores in the cobalt mines of Los, Sweden. The ore was described by miners as &quot;kupfernickel&quot; because it had a similar appearance to copper (kupfer) and a mischievous sprite (nickel) was supposed by miners to be the cause of their failure to extract copper from it. Cronstedt presented his research on nickel to the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1751 and 1754. Decades later, some scientists still argued that it was a mixture, and not a new metal, but its nature was eventually accepted.

In 1756, Cronstedt coined the term zeolite after heating the mineral stilbite with a blowpipe flame. He was the first to describe its distinctive properties, having observed the &quot;frothing&quot; when heated with a blowpipe.
Cronstedt&#x27;s book &quot;Försök til mineralogie, eller mineral-rikets upställning&quot; (“An attempt at mineralogy or arrangement of the Mineral Kingdom”, 1758) was originally published anonymously. In it, Cronstedt proposed that minerals be classified on the basis of chemical analysis of their composition. He was surprised that others supported his ideas and put them into practice. It was translated into English by Gustav Von Engeström (1738-1813) as &quot;An essay towards a system of mineralogy&quot; (1770). Engeström added an appendix, &quot;Description and Use of a Mineralogical Pocket Laboratory; and especially the Use of the Blow-pipe in Mineralogy&quot;, which brought considerable attention to Cronstedt&#x27;s use of the blowpipe.

Cronstedt noted in &quot;Försök til mineralogie, eller mineral-rikets upställning&quot; that he had observed an “unidentified earth” in a heavy red stone from the Bastnäs mine in Riddarhyttan. Forty-five years later, Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger isolated the first element of the lanthanide series of the rare earth elements, cerium, in ore from the mine.

==Awards and honors==
In 1753, Cronstedt was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="1267299" wikidata="Q7225532" url="?curid=1267299" title="Poll tax riots">
<text>The poll tax riots were a series of riots in British towns and cities during protests against the Community Charge (commonly known as the &quot;poll tax&quot;), introduced by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The largest protest occurred in central London on Saturday 31 March 1990, shortly before the tax was due to come into force in England and Wales.

==Background==
The advent of the poll tax was due to an effort to alter the way the tax system was used to fund local government in the UK. The system in place until this time was called &quot;rates&quot; and had been in place in some form from the beginning of the 17th century. The rates system has been described as &quot;a levy on property, which in modern times saw each taxpayer paying a rate based on the estimated rental value of their home&quot;.

The Thatcher government had long promised to replace domestic rates, which were unpopular, especially among Conservative voters. They were seen by many as an unfair way of raising revenue for local councils. It was levied on houses rather than people.

The proposed replacement was a flat-rate per capita Community Charge—&quot;a head tax that saw every adult pay a fixed rate amount set by their local authority&quot;. The new Charge was widely called a &quot;poll tax&quot; and was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales a year later. The Charge proved extremely unpopular; while students and the registered unemployed had to pay 20%, some large families occupying relatively small houses saw their charges go up considerably, and the tax was thus accused of saving the rich money and moving the expenses onto the poor.
In November 1989 the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation was set up by the Militant tendency. Other groups such as the 3D () network provided national coordination for anti-poll tax unions who were not aligned to particular political factions. After the leadership of the Labour Party refused to back any demonstration against the poll tax, the All Britain Federation called a demonstration in London for 31 March 1990, the day before the tax was due to be launched. 

During the early months of 1990, over 6,000 anti-poll tax actions were held nationwide, with demonstrations in cities around England and Wales drawing together thousands of protestors, in a wave of protests which attracted notably large numbers in the South West. On 6 March, a 5,000-strong demonstration in Bristol escalated into clashes, leading to mounted police charging the crowd and arresting 26 demonstrators, with injuries being sustained by both sides. The following day, police baton charged demonstrators in Hackney, escalating the demonstration into a riot, during which 50 high street shop windows were smashed and 56 rioters were arrested. Demonstrations were routinely called in places where councils discussed the poll tax, some resolving peacefully and others escalating into riots, with numerous cases of protestors storming council chambers and forcing meetings to be called off - although none prevented the tax from being implemented. Both Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and opposition leader Neil Kinnock responded by blaming the demonstrations on outside agitators, respectively calling them &quot;rent a mob extremists&quot; and &quot;Toy Town revolutionaries&quot;.

As coaches bound for London were booked all around the country, it soon became clear that the planned demonstration was going to be larger than the 20,000 expected by Militant, who were more focused on the non-payment campaign than political demonstrations. When campaigners met with Metropolitan Police and gave them an expected number of 30,000, the chief police officer responded with laughter, as their own intelligence indicated far fewer numbers. In acknowledgement of the square&#x27;s capacity, the organisers asked to divert the march to Hyde Park but were denied.

==Protest in Trafalgar Square==

By 2:30p.m. on 31 March 1990, Trafalgar Square was nearing its capacity. Unable to continue moving easily into Trafalgar Square, at about 3p.m. a march stopped in Whitehall. The police, worried about a surge towards the new security gates of Downing Street, blocked the top and bottom of Whitehall, and lined the pavement refusing to let people leave the road. Additional police units were dispatched to reinforce the officers manning the barrier blocking the Downing Street side of Whitehall. The section of the march which stopped opposite Downing Street reportedly contained veteran anarchists and a group called &quot;Bikers Against The Poll Tax&quot;, some of whom became aggravated by reportedly heavy-handed arrests, including one of a man in a wheelchair.

From 4pm, with the rally nearly officially over, contradictory reports began to arise. According to some sources, mounted riot police (officially used in an attempt to clear Whitehall of protesters) charged out of a side street into the crowd in Trafalgar Square. Whether intentional or not, this was interpreted by the crowd as a provocation, fueling anger in the Square where the police had already been pushing sections of crowd back into corners, leaving no way out except through the police. At 4:30pm, four shielded police riot vans drove into the crowd (a tactic in dealing with mass demonstrations at the time) outside the South African Embassy, attempting to force through to the entrance to Whitehall where police were re-grouping. The crowd attacked the vans with wooden staves and scaffolding poles. Soon after, rioting began to escalate.

The demonstrators mixed in with the general public. By midnight, released figures claimed 113 were injured, mostly members of the public, but also police officers, and 339 people had been arrested. Scuffles between rioters and police continued until 3am. Rioters attacked numerous shops, most notably Stringfellow&#x27;s nightclub, and car showrooms, and Covent Garden cafés and wine bars were set ablaze, along with motor vehicles.

==Responses==
The response of the Metropolitan Police, the Government, the Labour Party and the labour movement and some of the Marxist and Trotskyist left, notably the Militant tendency, was to condemn the riot as senseless and to blame anarchists. Tommy Sheridan of Scottish Militant Labour condemned the protesters. The next day, Steve Nally, also a Socialist Party member and Secretary of the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, said that they would &quot;hold an enquiry and name names&quot;. Many others denounced the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation position and defended those who fought back against the police attacks. Danny Burns (secretary of the Avon Federation of anti-Poll Tax Unions) for example said: &quot;Often attack is the only effective form of defence and, as a movement, we should not be ashamed or defensive about these actions; we should be proud of those who did fight back.&quot;

The Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (SWP), which was blamed for the violence by some in the media and by Labour MP George Galloway, refused to condemn protesters, calling the events a &quot;police riot&quot;. Pat Stack, then a member of the SWP&#x27;s Central Committee, told &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;We did not go on the demonstration with any intention of fighting with the police, but we understand why people are angry and we will not condemn that anger.&quot;

A 1991 police report concluded there was &quot;no evidence that the trouble was orchestrated by left-wing anarchist groups&quot;. Afterwards, the non-aligned Trafalgar Square Defendants Campaign was set up, committed to unconditional support for the defendants, and to accountability to the defendants. The Campaign acquired more than 50 hours of police videos. Use of these was influential in acquitting many of the 491 defendants, suggesting the police had fabricated or inflated charges.

In March 1991, the police report suggested additional contributing internal police factors: squeezed overtime budgets which led to the initial deployment of 2,000 men, insufficient given the number of demonstrators, a lack of riot shields (400 &quot;short&quot; riot shields were available), and erratic or poor-quality radio, with a lag of up to five minutes in the computerised switching of radio messages during the evening West End rioting. Prime Minister Thatcher was at a conference of the Conservative Party Council in Cheltenham; the poll tax was the focus of the conference. As coverage of the demonstrations unfolded, speculation developed for the first time about Thatcher&#x27;s position as leader. In November 1990, Thatcher would face a Party leadership challenge, and would lose to John Major in the subsequent leadership election.

==Abolition of the tax==
Vehement national opposition to the poll tax (which was especially strong in the north of England and Scotland) was the most important factor in its abolition. An opinion poll conducted in 1990 indicated that 78% of those polled and who expressed an opinion gave preference to alternative means of taxation.

John Major, initially in his first Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, only said his government would &quot;look at&quot; the Community Charge, and if necessary &quot;ensure it is accepted throughout the country&quot;, though it is a common misconception that he instantly scrapped it. In 1991, he then announced in a parliamentary speech as Prime Minister that the poll tax was to be replaced by Council Tax. The council tax came into effect in 1993. Similar to the previous system of rates, the new system set tax levels on property value. Although it was not directly linked to income, the council tax took ability to pay into consideration, unlike the poll tax.

<text>Franz Anton Schiefner (June 18, 1817 – November 16, 1879) was a Baltic German linguist and tibetologist.

Schiefner was born to a German-speaking family in Reval (Tallinn), Estonia, then part of Russian Empire. His father was a merchant who had emigrated from Bohemia. He was educated first at the Reval grammar school, matriculated at St Petersburg as a law student in 1836, and subsequently at Berlin, from 1840 to 1842, where he devoted himself exclusively to studies of Eastern languages. On his return to St Petersburg in 1843 he taught classics in the First Grammar School, and soon afterwards received a post in the Imperial Academy, where in 1852 the cultivation of the Tibetan language and literature was assigned to him as a special function. From 1860 to 1873 he simultaneously held the professorship of classical languages in the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. From 1854 until his death he was an extraordinary member of the Imperial Academy. He visited England three times for purposes of research in 1863, 1865 and 1878.

Schiefner made his mark in literary research in three directions. First, he contributed to the &quot;Memoirs and Bulletin of the St Petersburg Academy&quot;, and brought out independently a number of valuable articles and larger publications on the language and literature of Tibet. He possessed also a remarkable acquaintance with the Mongolian language, and when death overtook him had just finished a revision of the New Testament in that language with which the British and Foreign Bible Society had entrusted him.

Further, he was one of the greatest authorities on the philology and ethnology of the Finnic languages. He edited and translated the great Finnish epic &quot;Kalevala&quot; into German; he arranged, completed and brought out in twelve volumes the literary remains of Matthias Alexander Castrén, bearing on the languages of the Samoyedic tribes, the Koibal, Karagas, Tungusic, Buryat, Ostyak and Kottic tongues, and prepared several valuable papers on Finnic mythology for the Imperial Academy.

In the third place, he investigated the languages of the Caucasus, which his lucid analyses placed within reach of European philologists. Thus he gave a full analysis of the Tush language, and in quick succession, from Baron Peter von Uslar&#x27;s investigations, comprehensive papers on the Avar, Udi, Abkhaz, Chechen, Kasi-Kumuk, and Hyrcanian languages. He had also mastered Ossetic, and brought out a number of translations from that language, several of them accompanied by the original text.

He died in Saint Petersburg.

<text>Mystère (, , &quot;mystery&quot;) is a resident Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Held in a custom theatre at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, the show was first performed on 25 December 1993, making it the company&#x27;s longest running show. As with many Cirque du Soleil productions, &quot;Mystère&quot; features a mixture of circus skills, dance, elaborate sets, opera, worldbeat music, and street theatre-style comedy. Featuring a musical score composed by René Dupéré and Benoît Jutras, the show was created under the direction of Franco Dragone.

==History==
The idea for &quot;Mystère&quot; started around 1990. It was originally planned for Caesars Palace with a theme based on Greek and Roman mythology. The plan, however, was scrapped by the casino executives, who thought the project would be too financially risky. &quot;Mystère&quot; was very different from the typical material they were used to in a Las Vegas show. According to &quot;Mystère&quot; set designer Michel Crête, &quot;Vegas... was still very influenced by Folies Bergère, with the scarves, feather boas, etc. There was a European culture already in place, oddly enough, not an American one. The people who opened the door for something new were Siegfried and Roy. They were the first to move away from the Folies Bergère thing.&quot;

Treasure Island picked up the show three years later. &quot;Mystère&quot; was the first Cirque du Soleil show that would have its own theater, rather than touring with a circus tent. &quot;Mystère&quot; would have a permanent base in Las Vegas. They worked with The Mirage hotel to produce a show.

Recent milestones &quot;Mystère&quot; has achieved include:
* &quot;Mystère&quot; celebrated their 20th anniversary on 25 December 2013 
* &quot;Mystère&quot; celebrated their 10,000th show on 27 December 2014.
* &quot;Mystère&quot; celebrated their 11,111th show on 17 May 2017.
* &quot;Mystére&quot; celebrated their 30th anniversary on 25 December 2023

==Set and technical information==
The theater is a unique theater built in the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino specifically for the show. The design of the theater was created by Michel Crête and that of Montreal-based team of Scéno Plus. This theater seats 1,541 audience members. The stage measures 120 feet by 70 feet deep and covers approximately 10,032 square feet. The stage floor is made of a layer of Base Mat, which is rubber made from recycled old tires and sneakers. This helps give the stage some bounce for tumbling. This is held together by polyurethane adhesive and covered with thousands of gallons of liquid that dries onto the surface. The Downstage D Lift is 36 feet in diameter and includes a 28-foot revolving stage. The revolving stage rotates up to 10 revolutions per minute. Props, equipment, and performers are elevated to stage level from the basement or trap by four moving lifts. These moving lifts were constructed in Montreal and then assembled in Las Vegas, NV.

The snail seen growing larger throughout the show is called Alice. By the end of the show, she is a giant inflatable puppet controlled by four puppeteers from the inside. The puppeteers move her around by following markings on the floor, since they can not see outside the puppet. They also control her eyes, torso, and tail.

The taiko drums in &quot;Mystère&quot; are created by the Japanese company Asano Taiko, located in Mattō, Ishikawa Prefecture. The largest drum in &quot;Mystère&quot; is the ōdaiko, which is in diameter and in length, and weighs half a ton. Due to the large size of the drum, it had to be brought into the theatre during construction. Since the completion of the theatre the drum can not be removed, as no door is large enough to accommodate it.

==Characters==
The cast of &quot;Mystère&quot; comprises a myriad of fantastic and mysterious characters. All this information was confirmed by Mystère&#x27;s artistic director from 1995 to 2001: Pavel Brun.
* Inti X &amp; Y (Spermatos/Spermatites): A comic chorus representing the seeds of life.
* Red Bird: Convinced he can fly. According to Pavel Brun, he is the main character in the entire narrative of Mystère&#x27;s universe. 
* Les Laquais: The &quot;lackeys&quot; of &quot;Mystère&quot; who serve and support others. They perform in the Korean plank act.

==Costumes==
Dominique Lemieux took inspiration from nature to create the colorful costumes of &quot;Mystère&quot;. One such costume is the Firebird, which has red feathers and accents that give the impression of embers flying through the air. The odd-looking Spermatos and Spermatites are dressed in elongated costumes which bulge in the center and have a tendril-like feature on the head. To give the characters an organic nature, spandex/lycra was used in conjunction with fringes and borders.

==Music==
The original score of &quot;Mystère&quot; was composed by René Dupéré, who had composed all of Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s earlier shows, including &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot; and &quot;Saltimbanco&quot;. In 1994 the show&#x27;s music was released as a studio album featuring the vocals of Canadian singers Élise Gouin (now known as Élise Velle) and Nathalie Gauvin.

In 1995 the show underwent an artistic overhaul, including changes in the lineup of acts. The &quot;Manipulation&quot; act was replaced by the &quot;Aerial Cube&quot;, the Flying Trapeze act by the Aerial High Bars (the Flying Trapeze returned in 2012), and the Acro Net setup dance act was excluded from the show. At the same time the musical score was renovated with assistance from Benoît Jutras, a longtime music director and arranger for Cirque who later went on to compose for &quot;Quidam&quot; and other Cirque shows. The result, captured in the album &quot;Mystère: Live in Las Vegas&quot;, was a score that reflects the diverse compositional styles of both composers. &quot;Mystère: Live in Las Vegas&quot; is a live, in-house recording of the new score, featuring Nathalie Gauvin and Wendy Talley on vocals; the album was released on November 12, 1996. After the release of the live album, the music was rearranged and altered once again. While the album resembles the current live music closely, it is not identical. For the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the show in 2018, a vinyl album specifically dedicated to the employees was created in limited quantities, just as it was done for the show Alegria in 1994 and Saltimbanco in 1997.

<text>The Douglas Skystreak (D-558-1 or D-558-I) is an American single-engine jet research aircraft of the 1940s. It was designed in 1945 by the Douglas Aircraft Company for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, in conjunction with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The Skystreak was a turbojet-powered aircraft that took off from the ground under its own power and had unswept flying surfaces.

==Development==
The D558 program was conceived as a joint NACA/U.S. Navy research program for transonic and supersonic flight. As originally envisioned, there would be three phases to the D558 program: a jet-powered airplane, a mixed rocket/jet-powered configuration, and a design and mockup of a combat aircraft. A contract for design and construction of six D558-1 aircraft for the first phase was issued on 22 June 1945. The original plan had been for six aircraft with a mixture of nose and side air inlets and varying wing airfoil sections. That plan was quickly reduced to three aircraft of a single configuration with a nose inlet. Plans for the second phase with mixed rocket/jet propulsion were also dropped. Instead, a new aircraft, the D558-2, was designed with mixed rocket and jet propulsion for supersonic flight.

Construction of the first 558-1 began in 1946 and was completed in January 1947. The fuselage used lightweight, high strength HK31 magnesium alloy extensively, while the wings were fabricated from more conventional aluminum alloys. The airframe was designed to withstand unusually high loads of up to 18 times gravity due to the uncertainties of transonic flight. The forward fuselage, including the cockpit, could be jettisoned from the aircraft in an emergency. The aircraft was configured to carry more than of test equipment, including sensors (such as strain gauges and accelerometers) in 400 locations throughout the aircraft. One wing was pierced by 400 small holes for the pressure measurements required for calculating airloads.

The Skystreaks were powered by one Allison J-35-A-11 engine (developed by General Electric as the TG-180) — one of the first axial-flow turbojets of American origin — and carried 230 US gallons (871 L) of jet fuel (kerosene).

==Operational history==
All the Skystreaks were initially painted scarlet, which led to the nickname &quot;crimson test tube.&quot; NACA later had the color of the Skystreaks changed to white to improve optical tracking and photography. The first of three D-558-1 Skystreaks, BuNo &quot;37970&quot;, made its maiden flight on 14 April 1947, at Muroc Army Air Field (later named Edwards AFB). Less than 4 months later, on August 20, this aircraft with Commander Turner Caldwell, USN, reached flying D-558-1 #1. This was recognised as an official world air speed record, as the World War II German Me 163B V18 &quot;Komet&quot; rocket fighter prototype that was claimed to have reached in July 1944 did so in secrecy and not under the strict conditions that regulate official records (presence of FIA officials as observers, timed runs in two directions to cancel out wind speed, etc). The D-558-1 #1 Skystreak&#x27;s record lasted 5 days, and was broken by then-Lieutenant Colonel Marion Carl, USMC, going faster in D-558-1 #2, BuNo &quot;37971&quot;. This aircraft was delivered to the NACA Muroc Flight Test Unit in April 1949 after 101 flights had been completed by the Navy, Air Force, and Douglas. This aircraft was never flown by the NACA. The D-558-1 #1 is located at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

Following 27 flights by the Navy and Douglas the second D-558-1 aircraft was delivered to the NACA in November 1947. The D-558-1 #2 underwent extensive instrumentation by the NACA Muroc instrumentation section. The number 2 Skystreak made a total of 19 flights with the NACA before it crashed on takeoff due to compressor disintegration on May 3, 1948, killing NACA pilot Howard C. Lilly. The third D-558-I, BuNo &quot;37972&quot;, aircraft was delivered to the NACA Muroc Flight Test Unit in 1949 after three Douglas test pilots and Howard Lilly had flown it. The number three aircraft took over the planned flight program of the D-558-1 #2. From the first flight in 1949 through 1953 the third Skystreak was flown in an intensive flight-research program by seven NACA test pilots, with a great deal of useful data collected on high-subsonic handling. The D-558-1 #3 made a total of 78 research flights with the NACA before being retired on June 10, 1953. The third Skystreak is on display at Carolinas Aviation Museum located at the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Skystreak reached Mach 0.99 in level flight, but only flew supersonic in a dive. In the public mind, much of the research performed by the D-558-1 Skystreaks was quickly overshadowed by Chuck Yeager and the supersonic Bell X-1 rocket plane. However, the Skystreak performed an important role in aeronautical research by flying for extended periods of time at transonic speeds, which freed the X-1 to fly for limited periods at supersonic speeds.

<text>Mitzpe Ramon (, Ramon Lookout; ) is a local council in the Negev desert of southern Israel. It is situated on the northern ridge at an elevation of 860 meters (2,800 feet) overlooking the world&#x27;s largest erosion cirque, known as the Makhtesh Ramon. In it had a population of .

==History==

Mitzpe Ramon was founded in 1951 as a camp for the workers building Highway 40. The town&#x27;s first permanent residents, several young families from Kibbutz Re&#x27;im and other parts of Israel began settling there in 1956. After five years, the town was home to 370 residents including 160 children, most of them veteran Israelis. There were also 180 housing units to absorb new immigrants They were joined by immigrants from North Africa, Romania, and India in the 1960s, and it became the southernmost of the Negev&#x27;s development towns.

Conditions in the early years were harsh, with limited food supplies and practically no modern-day amenities. Ice blocks and provisions were delivered once a week by a supply truck. There was a single school with one classroom for all ages. The homes of the first settlers were prefabricated asbestos barracks. Later, rows of small attached stone houses were built and after that, apartment buildings, beginning in the early 1960s.

On April 29, 1964, a Nord 2501D Noratlas (4X-FAD/044) of the IAF crashed into a mountain near Mitzpe Ramon, killing all nine on board, including pilots Hagay Gilboa and Shlomo Tzlil. The crash is currently Israel&#x27;s deadliest.

In 1972, Mitzpe Ramon had a population of about 1,400 people living in 300 households. The town further grew after Ramon Airbase was completed in 1982. In 1988, the town had a population of about 3,000, and it experienced more significant population growth when it absorbed Soviet immigrants during the 1990s post-Soviet aliyah.

== Geology and climate ==
Ramon Crater, known as a &quot;makhtesh&quot; Ramon, is 38 km long, 6 km wide and 450 meters deep.

Mitzpe Ramon&#x27;s climate borders between hot desert climate and cold desert climate (Köppen climate classification: BWh/BWk), characterized by hot, dry summers and cold winters. There are moderate to strong winds all year long, caused by its location above the crater, which make Mitzpe Ramon feel much colder than it really is. Precipitation is scarce, concentrated around the winter months, with an annual precipitation amount of roughly . Snowfall occurs on average once in a couple of years. Night frost occurs almost every winter.

== Economy ==

The development of Mitzpe Ramon was adversely affected by the opening of Route 90 in the late 1960s. After the inauguration of this highway, traffic to and from Eilat bypassed Mitzpe Ramon almost entirely. However, growing interest in ecotourism, Jeep trekking (access to Nabatean ruins), mountain biking and hiking, stargazing and the upgrading of Route 40, which is considered a more scenic route to Eilat, have improved the economy.

Jerusalem Marble, one of a few major suppliers and overseas exporters of Jerusalem stone (established in 1923), inaugurated a state-of-the-art factory in Mitzpe Ramon in January 2000. Jerusalem Stone is exported globally.

Mitzpe Ramon has six hotels and dozens of bed and breakfast establishments. In 2011, the Isrotel hotel chain opened a luxury hotel, the Beresheet Hotel, in Mitzpe Ramon.

The Tourism Ministry allocated NIS 9.5 million for infrastructure development in Mitzpe Ramon, and the Ministry for the Development of the Negev and Galilee financed the construction of a landing strip for light aircraft. In December 2013, a Las Vegas-style Casino was planned for the town.

== Local government ==
The previous mayor, Flora Shoshan, sister of former Israeli defense minister Amir Peretz and wife of the former mayor, Sami Shoshan, was voted out on October 23, 2013, and replaced by Roni Marom, in a landslide victory for Marom.

== Music and culture ==
The Mitzpe Ramon Jazz Club hosts musical ensembles on the weekend. On weekdays, it operates as a music school. &#x27;Me&#x27;ever&#x27;, a hostel and event space, is in the artist quarter of Mitzpe Ramon.

<text>Johan Gottlieb Gahn (19 August 1745 – 8 December 1818) was a Swedish chemist and metallurgist who isolated manganese in 1774.

Gahn studied in Uppsala from 1762 to 1770 and became acquainted with chemists Torbern Bergman and Carl Wilhelm Scheele. 1770 he settled in Falun, where he introduced improvements in copper smelting, and participated in building up several factories, including those for vitriol, sulfur and red paint.

He was the chemist for the Swedish Board of Mines from 1773 to 1817. He was very reluctant to publish his scientific findings himself, but freely communicated them to Bergman and Scheele. One of Gahn&#x27;s discoveries was that manganese dioxide could be reduced to manganese metal using carbon, becoming the first to isolate this element in its metal form.

In 1784, Gahn was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He also had a managerial career in Swedish mining.

<text>La Nouba was a Cirque du Soleil show that ran for 19 years in a custom-built, freestanding theater at Disney Springs&#x27; West Side at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. It was a contemporary circus performance featuring acrobats, gymnasts, and other skilled performers. The show&#x27;s creation was directed by Franco Dragone, who also directed many of Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s earlier shows. Its title derives from the French phrase &quot;faire la nouba&quot;, meaning &quot;to party&quot; or &quot;to live it up&quot;.

The show was succeeded by &quot;Drawn to Life&quot;, which premiered on November 18, 2021.

==History==
On December 23, 1998, the entertainment company Cirque du Soleil premiered a contemporary circus production, &quot;La Nouba&quot;, in a new theater custom-designed and built for Cirque du Soleil in Downtown Disney (later renamed Disney Springs) at the Walt Disney World Resort. With an international cast of 67 artists, the show welcomed more than 1,650 spectators ten times a week. The show was Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s third resident (non-touring) show created after &quot;Mystère&quot; and &quot;O&quot; in Las Vegas.

In 2007, 12 members of the power track act performed a routine during the pre-game show of Super Bowl XLI.

&quot;La Nouba&quot; reached a major milestone on July 10, 2009, during its 9pm showing—this was their 5000th performance. On August 13, 2011, during the 6pm showing, the show celebrated its 6000th performance. The show&#x27;s 7000th performance was celebrated on September 12, 2013, at the 6pm showing. &quot;La Nouba&quot; celebrated its 15th anniversary on December 18, 2013, with a special appearance from Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse. This was the first time any Disney characters had appeared in the show.

&quot;La Nouba&quot; ended its 19-year run on December 31, 2017, to be replaced by a new Cirque du Soleil show. The show, &quot;Drawn to Life&quot;, premiered on 18 November 2021.

==Set and technical information==
The theater housing &quot;La Nouba&quot; was the first freestanding permanent structure built for Cirque du Soleil. The theater was designed by Michel Crête, Michel Aubé of Scéno Plus, Walt Disney Imagineering, and the architects of the Rockwell Group of New York. It could seat a total of 1,671 people per show. The building incorporated elements of fabric and tension reminiscent of the form of a circus tent.
The backdrop of the stage was a trellis measuring and made of PVC panels and scrim. The stage floor itself had five elevator lifts, each with a load capacity. These lifts could move at a rate of and rise to a maximum height of . The center stage lift, in addition to elevating, could also descend below the stage on a second axis. Other movable set elements included the two téléphériques installed along the back wall which could transport acrobatic equipment, props, and scenery at a pace of .

Four retractable power track floors were housed in the stage. Each floor weighed over and could move up to . The trampoline bed was tighter and used the second generation of springs, allowing the performers to jump higher and faster down the track, which measured in length. The trampolines consisted of two overlapping tracks, as seen in &quot;Alegría&quot;. The entire stage deck was layered with impact-resilient Mondo Sport Floor over wood in order to avoid injury.

The theater&#x27;s immense height (ground level to fly height was ; ground level to top of the masts was ) allowed the scenic and acrobatic equipment to be stored in the ceiling. As another first for Cirque du Soleil, the trapeze net was installed mechanically during the show with no visible stagehands as it was lowered into place from the ceiling.

==Characters==
In &quot;La Nouba&quot; there were two main character categories: the &quot;Cirques&quot;, or circus people, sporting bright, fluorescent colors; and the &quot;Urbains&quot;, or urbanites, who wore dark, muted colors or monochromatic costumes. As in every Cirque du Soleil show, in addition to the performances, there were several distinctive characters that participated in the show, sometimes as performers and sometimes as spectators. In &quot;La Nouba&quot;, these included:
* L&#x27;Oiseau (The Green Bird): Out of her cage, this bird wants to fly, and is very marionettesque in her actions.
* Les Cons (The Nuts): Dressed in all-white, these mischievous characters are the ever-present fools of the show.
* Le Titan (The Titan): The show&#x27;s resident &quot;strong man&quot; who confronts everyone on stage while contorting his body in unusual poses.
* Le Promeneur (The Walker): Dressed in grey pinstripes with a small bowler hat, he sees the world through happiness.
* Liama: A princess in the world of &quot;La Nouba&quot; who sings her joy and passion.
* The Peacock Singer: A ambiguous character, dangerous and protective at the same time. He lives in height, perched at the top of the mountain, on the wall at the End of the World, where he sings the tale of all the action he sees from the sky, like a bird.
* The Devil: Far away at the End of the World lives the Devil, who creates desire and fears into the hearth of lovers.
* The Pierrot Acrobat: Agile and nimble, he appears as a red acrobat. He is the adversary of the Titan until he joins him in mutual admiration at the end of the show. He is part of the Red Pierrot family, themselves part of a larger group of individuals known as Les Cirques. He appears up on the mountain, on the wall at the End of the World, on the Rocks, at the heart of the action.
* Les Danseurs (The Dancers): The Romeo and Juliet of the show. One is a Lost Ballerina, who looking for a purpose to her existence. She will find love and join the Cirques. The second is the Pierrot Clown, a lost soul in the dark city, who will find a purpose and motivation to evolve through his love for the Lost Ballerina.
* Clowns:
** Balto and Sergey (1998–2013): An unexpected clown duo directing people to their seats. Balthazar was originally created by Michel Deschamps in the 1970s and joined Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s 1989-1990 American and European tours and &quot;Fascination&quot; in Japan in 1992. He also made occasional appearances in &quot;Alegría&quot; during its first European tour. Sergei Shashalev also previously appeared in the latter.
** The Pablos (2014–2017): Former &quot;Alegría&quot; clowns who joined this show in 2014.
* The Prince: A noble prince transformed into a frog.
* The Rag Doll: A rag doll left in the attic that will fly away for a while with The Walker through the door of her imagination.
* The Jester: A Circus equilibrist performing during the birthday dinner scene.
* Virginia, the Cleaning Lady: Also referred to as &quot;La Femme de Ménage&quot;, she is shocked to be in this world and astonished by what goes on around her. She sweeps and dusts nonetheless until her dream becomes a reality.
*The Automatons: Futuristic puppet-like creatures, originally part of the German Wheel and Skipping Rope act, no longer in the show.

==Acts==
The show contained the following acts:

* Breakdancing: Josh Ortiz (&quot;The Incredible Josh&quot;), Jean Carlos Lloret (&quot;Bebo&quot;), and Dmytro Li (&quot;Flying Buddha&quot;) performed routines that straddled the line between dance and acrobatics, with spins, flips and other tricks.
* Aerial bamboo: Alexander and Ekaterina Abramov did a variety of tricks while hanging from a pole-shaped apparatus suspended from the ceiling. This act originated in China using bamboo poles, hence its name.
* Diabolos: A children&#x27;s toy with a circus twist, four young and very talented girls threw hourglass-shaped, giant yoyos in the air with help of a long line of string connected to two sticks that they held in each hand. The children flipped, rolled, and even skipped with the string while the spinning diabolo plummeted to the stage to be caught at the last second. Up to two diabolos were manipulated by each performer in this game of dexterity.
* Cycles: Included one BMX cyclist and a mountain biker performing tricks on bicycles.
* Aerial cradle: The aerial cradle looked like a door and was the setting for a demonstration of equal-opportunity strength and agility. This display featured elements of traditional circus aerial cradle but added a unique twist: the male and female artists took turns supporting one another, above the stage.
* Aerial ballet in silk: A solo male performer dangled above the stage using incredible strength to create multiple poses, while four female artists wrapped themselves in the long column of silk and then unwrapped themselves by spinning and flipping in this sky high ballet. This was the most dangerous act in &quot;La Nouba&quot; as it used no wires or support, only the artists&#x27; concentration.
* Rola bola: A colorful performer built a tower of cylinders and pipes, all the while balancing on a board on top of it all. As his tower grew higher and higher, so did the risk and excitement; the acrobat juggled while on top of the shaky tower.
* Flying trapeze: Four pendulum-like swings, on two different levels, carried a team of perfectly synchronized aerialists above the stage.
* Power track and trampoline: This high-energy spectacle had performers literally bouncing off the walls and through the windows and roof of a three-dimensional building. This seven-and-a-half minute act included athletes performing 394 flips and 62 twists.

===Acts in rotation===
* Cyr wheel: This act was a backup act for aerial bamboo and was not commonly performed in the show.

===Retired acts===
* Balancing on chairs: Featured a solo performer who hand-balanced on eight chairs stacked on a table. The chair stack rose in the air. The area below the chairs and table rose via a platform raising the performer a full above the stage. This act was originally created and performed by Vasily Demenchukov, who had previously performed a similar act in the Nouvelle Expérience. The act was then taken over by Rokardy Rodriguez in 2002, who kept performing until the entire act was replaced with Anthony Gatto&#x27;s juggling act in 2010.
* German wheel: Featured two performers inside of large double-hoops, manipulated by shifting their center of gravity. The performers would roll around obstacles, fall over spinning until they were almost flat on the ground then stand back up, and perform tricks with both performers in one wheel. This act was replaced by the jump rope act in 2010.
* Juggling: Anthony Gatto juggled clubs, rings and balls. This act was replaced by the rola bola act in 2014.
* Jump rope: A rebooted version of the young children&#x27;s game, two expert skipping soloists were the centre of attention in this speedy act. In 2015, this act made way for the B-boys.
* High wire: The entire act took place on a -long high wire. Wire walkers ascended to a height of above the stage, supported by a half-inch steel wire. This act was replaced by the aerial bamboo act in 2015.

== Costumes ==
Costume designer Dominique Lemieux created thirty different costume concepts and drew up at least ten different designs for each concept. Lemieux mixed historical and traditional circus ideas with contemporary fashions in her designs, and ten special technicians were employed in order to custom dye fabrics, real and synthetic hair, feathers, horsehair, and leather materials used on the various costumes. In the eight weeks, she was given to design the costumes (October 24 to December 23, 1998), she created two drastically different styles to separate the urban people from the circus people. The circus people donned bright, neon colors while the urbanites were represented by black, gray, and muted tones. Lemieux used natural, textured fabrics such as hemp to epitomize the urbanites.

Many of the performers underwent a metamorphosis indicated by often dramatic costume changes; for instance, the urbanites&#x27; outfits began in dark, muted blues, reds, and greens and ended in white, fairy-like outfits. In the German wheel costumes, Lemieux accented dark colors with fluorescent fabrics to provide a high contrast with the black lights used during this act. The performers were designed to appear as marionettes and to emphasize human anatomy. The costumes designed for the flying trapeze act were tribal and androgynous. They were elaborated with complex collars, head ornaments and tutu skirts for the males. Les Cons were inspired by the Pierrot, with simple, white outfits to depict their innocence.

For all Cirque du Soleil productions, plaster head molds were created to make certain that all wigs, masks, and headpieces fit perfectly. Four different wig designs were created for the show and each wig took one person approximately seventy hours to complete.

==Music==
The music of &quot;La Nouba&quot;, composed by Benoît Jutras, was performed live by six musicians and two singers. A CD album of the music of &quot;La Nouba&quot; was originally released in 1999 and re-released in 2005. It features most of the music played during the show.

<text>August Wilhelm Ferdinand Schirmer (born 6 May 1802 in Berlin; died 8 June 1866 in Nyon) was a German landscape artist.

==Biography==
Schirmer was born in Berlin. As a youth Schirmer painted flowers in the royal porcelain factory; afterwards he became a pupil of Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow in the Berlin Academy, but his art owed most to Italy. In 1827 he went to Italy, where his sojourn extended over three years. He became a disciple of his countryman Joseph Koch, who built historic landscape on the Poussins, and is said to have caught inspiration from J. M. W. Turner. In 1831 Schirmer established himself in Berlin in a studio with scholars. From 1839 to 1865 he was professor of landscape in the academy.

Schirmer&#x27;s place in the history of art is distinctive. His sketches in Italy were more than transcripts of the spots; he studied nature with the purpose of composing historic and poetic landscapes. On the completion of the Berlin Museum of Antiquities came his opportunity. Upon the walls he painted classic sites and temples, and elucidated the collections by the landscape scenery with which they were historically associated.

Schirmer&#x27;s goal was to make his art the poetic interpretation of nature and he deemed technique secondary to conception.

<doc id="1267327" wikidata="Q2270152" url="?curid=1267327" title="Mediumwave transmitter Bremen">
<text>The Mediumwave Transmitter Bremen was the mediumwave broadcasting facility of Radio Bremen situated at Bremen-Oberneuland, Germany. It operated at 936 kHz, with a transmitter output power of 50 kW. The transmitter at Bremen-Oberneuland was built in 1999 as a replacement for the old transmission facility of Radio Bremen at Leher Feld, which was demolished to make room for an industrial area.

== History ==
The transmitter station was built when Radio Bremen was established in 1950. Founded by an US-American donation on October 15, 1951, the 20 kW of Radio Bremen Radio Bremen at Leher Feld got on air. To avoid of interferences with a transmitter in Tirana on the same frequency the direction to manteld to south-east was manteled. In 1999 the new, but smaller transmitter close to the Wümme bog grassland was built.

The mediumwave transmitter Bremen was the only transmitter owned by Radio Bremen — all other transmitters now used by Radio Bremen are the property of Deutsche Telekom — used a cage aerial, mounted on a 45-metre (146 feet) high, grounded, guyed lattice steel mast. This aerial had a high gain of 4.5 dB, which means that the 50 kW transmitter feeding it produced the same effect as a 140 kW transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1 dB.

The broadcasts from this transmitter reached all northern Germany during daylight, except the most eastern areas. At night it covered all of Europe, although a transmitter operating at the same frequency in Lviv, Ukraine often interfered with it. In 2006 the aerial mast got a new coat of paint.

Due to financial difficulties, Radio Bremen switched off the transmitter in March 2010 &quot;temporarily&quot; and dismantled it in 2014 after only 200 people voiced their protest.

<text>Franz-Joseph Müller, Freiherr von Reichenstein or Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein (1 July 1740 or 4 October 1742 – 12 October 1825 or 1826) was an Austrian mineralogist and mining engineer. Müller held several positions in the Habsburg monarchy administration of mines and coinage in the Banat, Transylvania, and Tyrol. During his time in Transylvania he discovered tellurium in 1782. In his later career he became a member of the imperial council in Vienna and was knighted and elevated to the rank Freiherr in 1820.

==Place and date of birth==
Müller was born in 1740 or 1742 in the Habsburg Empire. While the &quot;Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie&quot; gives 1 July 1740 and Vienna as date and place of birth, the &quot;Neue Deutsche Biographie&quot; prefers 4 October 1742 and the small town of Poysdorf in Lower Austria. The much older works &quot;Neuer Nekrolog der Deutschen&quot; and &quot;Oesterreichische National-Encyklopädie&quot; do not give a place of birth and only the year 1740 for his birth. Even articles by Mary Elvira Weeks on the discovery of tellurium, published in the Journal of Chemical Education in 1932, and 1935 quote two different locations of his birth: one in Vienna, Archduchy of Austria and the other Hermannstadt, Principality of Transylvania (present-day Sibiu, Romania). A newer biography on the topic makes clear that date and place of birth are not definitely known.

==Education and career==
He studied philosophy and law in Vienna. After finishing his studies he started further studies at the Bergakademie (Mining Academy) in Schemnitz (Selmecbánya), Lower Hungary (today Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia) in 1763. He studied mining, mechanics, mineralogy and chemistry and after graduating he became a Markscheider (official mine surveyor) in 1768. In 1770 he joined the Hofcommission für die Regulierung der Banater Berg und Hüttenwerke (royal commission for mining in the Banat) where he gained a lot of knowledge on mining in the Banat. He was promoted to the rank of an Oberbergmeister (senior mining official) and became a mine manager in the same year.

In 1775 he became Oberbergmeister in the Tyrol town of Schwaz. Schwaz was one of the largest centres of silver and copper mining in Austria-Hungary in that time. In 1778 he discovered an occurrence of tourmaline in the Zillertal.

Müller became one of seven Thesaurariats councillor in Transylvania responsible for the supervision of all mining and coinage activities in Transylvania in 1778. After the dissolution of the Thesaurariat Müller became Oberinspector (chief surveyor) of all mining, smelting and salt production in Transylvania.

===Discovery of tellurium===
Müller as the Austrian chief surveyor of mines in Transylvania was responsible for the analysis of ore samples. He analyzed gold ore from Kleinschlatten (today Zlatna, Romania). This ore was known as &quot;Faczebajer weißes blättriges Golderz&quot; (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja) or &quot;antimonalischer Goldkies&quot; (antimonic gold pyrite), and, according to Anton von Rupprecht, was &quot;Spießglaskönig&quot; (&quot;argent molybdique&quot;), containing native antimony. Müller concluded that the ore did not contain antimony, but that it was bismuth sulfide. The following year, he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony. After a thorough investigation which lasted for three years and consisted of more than fifty tests, Müller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted the radish-like odor of the white smoke which passed off when the new metal was heated, the red color which the metal imparts to sulfuric acid, and the black precipitate which this solution gives when diluted with water. Nevertheless, he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names and , as it did not show the properties predicted for the expected antimony.

In 1798, the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth isolated the new element from a sample sent by Müller. After a thorough examination of the material he concluded that a new metal was present in the sample. He called it tellurium, but gave the credit of the discovery to Müller.

===Later life===
In 1788 he was once more promoted and as Gubernialrath he held a powerful position in the administration of Transylvania. Müller was knighted by Leopold II to the lowest title of nobility, Edler, in the same year. From that point on he carried the name Franz-Joseph Müller Edler von Reichenstein. He was elected as a member of the Berlin Society of Friends of Natural Science.

In 1798 Müller became court counsellor and was appointed to the court in Vienna, where he was part of the imperial council. In 1818 Müller retired from his duties but held his position in the council until his death. He became Knight of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary in 1818 and became a noble by receiving the title of a Freiherr in 1820. Both honours were granted by the Emperor Franz I (II). Müller died in his 80s in 1825 or 1826 in Vienna.

<text>Grace Dalrymple Elliott (c. 1754 – 16 May 1823) was a Scottish courtesan, writer and spy resident in Paris during the French Revolution. She was an eyewitness to events detailed in her memoirs, &quot;Journal of my life during the French Revolution (Ma Vie sous la Révolution)&quot; published posthumously in 1859. She was mistress, first to the future George IV, by whom she is said to have borne an illegitimate daughter, and then to the Duke of Orléans. Elliott trafficked correspondence and helped condemned Royalists and members of the French nobility escape from the First French Republic during the Reign of Terror. She was arrested several times but managed to avoid the guillotine, and was released following the military coup that ended the Terror and resulted in the execution of Robespierre.

In the acclaimed but widely controversial 2001 film adaptation of her memoirs by French New Wave director Éric Rohmer as &quot;The Lady and the Duke&quot;, Grace Elliot was played by English actress Lucy Russell.

==Early life==
Elliott was born probably in Edinburgh about 1754, the youngest daughter of Grissel Brown (died 30 September 1767) and Hew Dalrymple (died 1774), an Edinburgh advocate concerned in the great Douglas case. Her parents separated around the time of her birth, and she was most likely brought up at her grandparents&#x27; house.

She was educated in a French convent, and on her return to Scotland, was introduced by her father into Edinburgh society. Her beauty made such an impression on John Eliot, a prominent and wealthy physician, that he made her an offer of marriage in 1771. She accepted, although Eliot was about 18 years her senior. They were married on 19 October 1771 in London, when she was 17. The couple entered fashionable society, but eventually grew apart due to their difference in age and interests. In 1774 Elliott met and fell in love with Lord Valentia, with whom she entered into an affair. Convinced of his wife&#x27;s infidelity, John Eliot had the couple followed and eventually sued Valentia for criminal conversation (adultery). He received £12,000 in damages before successfully obtaining a divorce.

With her social reputation destroyed, Elliott became recognised as a member of the demimonde and forced to earn her living as a professional mistress or courtesan. She was then taken by her brother to a French convent, but she seems to have been brought back almost immediately by Lord Cholmondeley, who became her lover and remained one of her principal protectors throughout her life.

==Life in England==
Having met Lord Cholmondeley at the Pantheon in 1776, she began a liaison with him that lasted three years. Their friends included the courtesans Gertrude Mahon and Kitty Frederick. Thomas Gainsborough painted two portraits of her in 1778, which are in the Frick Collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1782, she had a short, concealed intrigue with the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV) and gave birth to a daughter on 30 March 1782, who was baptised at St Marylebone as Georgiana Augusta Frederica Seymour (d. 1813) but used the name Georgina Seymour.

Elliott declared that the Prince was the father of her child and &quot;The Morning Post&quot; stated in January 1782 that he admitted responsibility. However, the child was dark in complexion, and when she was first shown to the Prince, he is said to have remarked, &quot;To convince me that this is my girl they must first prove that black is white.&quot;

The Prince and many others regarded Lord Cholmondeley as the father of the girl, although the Prince&#x27;s friends said that Charles William Wyndham (brother of Lord Egremont), whom she was thought to resemble, claimed paternity. Yet others thought she might have been fathered by George Selwyn. Lord Cholmondeley brought up the girl, and after her early death in 1813, looked after her only child.

==Life in France: French Revolution==

George, Prince of Wales, introduced her to the French Duke of Orleans in 1784 and by 1786, she had permanently set up residence in Paris and become one of Orleans&#x27; recognised mistresses. In exchange for her companionship, the Duke granted her a home on the Rue Miromesnil and a property in Meudon, to the south of Paris. During this period Elliott also pursued liaisons with the Duke de Fitz-James and the Prince of Conde.

Much of what is known about Elliott&#x27;s life in France is recorded in her memoirs, &quot;Journal of my life during the French Revolution&quot; (Richard Bentley, 1859). Although there are a number of inconsistencies in her account, her work has become one of the best-known English-language accounts of The Terror, documenting the movements of the Duke of Orleans and those within his aristocratic Jacobin circle at the Palais-Royal. During her life in Paris, Elliott witnessed the horror of the September massacres and the body of the Princess de Lamballe carried through the streets. Although Elliott was an associate of the Duke of Orleans (who later took the name Philippe Égalité), her royalist sympathies soon became widely known throughout her district, and her home was frequently searched. It has been recently shown that Elliott was trafficking correspondence on behalf of the British government and assisting in the transportation of messages between Paris and members of the exiled French court in Coblenz and in Belgium.

Elliott risked her life several times to assist and hide aristocrats pursued by the Revolutionary government. Shortly after the Assault on the Tuileries Palace, on 10 August 1792, Elliott hid the injured Marquis de Champcentz by physically carrying him to her house on the Rue Miromesnil at great risk. During a search of her home, she placed him between the mattresses of her bed and feigned illness. On another occasion, Elliott agreed to take in and hide at her home in Meudon Madame de Perigord and her two children, who were attempting to flee to England. She helped to arrange false travel documents for several people wishing to escape the Revolution. After hiding Champcentz in the attic of her home in Meudon, she managed to fix his passage out of France. In the spring of 1793, however, she was arrested and imprisoned and spent the rest of the Terror in prisons, including the Recollets and the Carmes, where she claims to have met Joséphine de Beauharnais, although this has been questioned by historians. Her writings detail her harrowing prison experiences, the violent coercion she experienced, and the illness and deprivation endured by her fellow prisoners.

==Later life==
Although many of her friends met their deaths, including Madame du Barry, Elliott did not. She narrowly avoided death and was released after the Reign of Terror came to an end, not before she had been confined in a total of four different prisons by the Republican government. In later years, there were rumours that she had an attachment with Napoleon Bonaparte, but had rejected his offer of marriage. She died a wealthy woman at Ville d&#x27;Avray, in present-day Hauts-de-Seine, in May 1823, while a lodger with the commune&#x27;s mayor.

She was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Works==

==Depictions in film and literature==
A dramatic portrayal of part of her life is contained in Eric Rohmer&#x27;s 2001 historical drama and dystopian film &quot;The Lady and the Duke&quot;. English actress Lucy Russell played Elliott and Jean-Claude Dreyfus played the Duke of Orleans. The film received praise for its use of digital technology to recreate 18th-century Paris, but was also attacked in France for its graphic violence and harsh criticism of revolutionary terror and some even accused the film of being aristocratic propaganda. When asked about the controversy, lead actress Lucy Russell replied: &quot;There does seem to be a great problem, not just in France, but every country has problems facing up to the nasty parts of its history. But there&#x27;s a reason it was called the Terror.&quot;

Grace Elliott also appears as a major character in Hallie Rubenhold&#x27;s novel &quot;The French Lesson&quot; (Doubleday, 2016).

<text>Phi Delta Theta (), commonly known as Phi Delt, is an international secret and social fraternity founded in 1848, and currently headquartered, at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Phi Delta Theta, along with Beta Theta Pi and Sigma Chi form the Miami Triad. 

The fraternity has over 200 active chapters and colonies in over 44 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces and has initiated more than 310,000 men between 1848 and 2024. There are over 180,000 living alumni. Phi Delta Theta chartered house corporations own over 135 houses valued at over $141 million as of summer 2015. There are nearly 100 recognized alumni clubs across the U.S. and Canada.

Among the best-known members of the fraternity are Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd President of the United States, Vice President Adlai Stevenson I, chief justice of the United States Fred M. Vinson, Baseball Hall of Fame member Lou Gehrig, actor Burt Reynolds, architect Frank Lloyd Wright, astronaut Neil Armstrong, and John S. McCain Sr., U.S. Navy Admiral and grandfather of John McCain.

==History==
===Founding===
In 1839, Beta Theta Pi was founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In protest against the university&#x27;s president, members of Beta Theta Pi and another fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi, blocked the entrances of the main educational and administrative building in what became known as the &quot;Great Snowball Rebellion&quot; of 1848.

After the president expelled most of the students involved in the uprising, Phi Delta Theta was formed by six men staying in a dormitory the day after Christmas. Robert Morrison, a senior, proposed to classmate John McMillan Wilson that they form a secret society together; the two subsequently invited juniors Robert Thompson Drake and John Wolfe Lindley and sophomores Ardivan Walker Rodgers and Andrew Watts Rogers to join them. These men are known today as &quot;The Immortal Six.&quot; The first meeting was held in Wilson&#x27;s room at Old North Hall, now called Elliott Hall.

Phi Delta Theta was created under three principal objectives: &quot;the cultivation of friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high standard of morality&quot;. These cardinal principles are contained in &quot;The Bond&quot; of Phi Delta Theta, the document to which each member pledges on his initiation into the fraternity.

===19th century===
During the early meetings, the Founders wrote The Bond of Phi Delta Theta, which is the fundamental law of the fraternity. It has remained unchanged ever since, and it is believed to be the only document of any fraternity of such a nature. Morrison designed the shield form of the badge, with the eye as an emblem, while Wilson suggested the scroll with the Greek letters on it. The first branch of Phi Delta Theta was founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1848. Fearing punishment from the university, the activities of the fraternity were &quot;sub rosa&quot; for its first three years of existence. Phi Delta Theta also took an unusual step, unique among all fraternities, of splitting into two chapters at both Miami and Centre College, so their meetings would be smaller and attract less attention. Eventually, as the organization attracted new individuals into their membership including prominent university officials, members began to openly wear their badges indicating their affiliation.

Phi Delta Theta held its first convention in 1851 in Cincinnati when the organization had only four chapters. The event was attended by seven members. Despite the limited number, positive steps were taken for the establishment of new chapters by forming an expansion committee. It was also during the first convention that the chapter at Miami University was designated as the Grand Chapter whose duties were to oversee the overall fraternity operations. Subsequent conventions were held again in Cincinnati five years later; Bloomington, Indiana in 1858; and Danville, Kentucky in 1860. Another convention was held in 1864 in Bloomington during the American Civil War. The Civil War was difficult for all fraternities. Battles put fraternity brother against fraternity brother. Fifty Phis fought on the side of the Confederacy while 231 Phis fought for the Union Army.

At its convention in Indianapolis in 1868, the first steps were taken to create an overall administrative plan for the fraternity. The convention was regarded as the first &quot;National Convention&quot; as permanent convention rules were adopted during this time. Twelve years later, the most important of all Phi Delta Theta conventions took place. The Indianapolis Convention of 1880 established new rituals, insignia, and customs that are still used today. Moreover, the convention saw the creation of the General Council, the governing body of the fraternity, with Walter B. Palmer, &quot;Emory-Vanderbilt 1877&quot;, and George Banta, &quot;Franklin-Indiana 1876&quot;, becoming the president and historian, respectively. The convention also called for the organization of groups of chapters into provinces, which were to be headed by province presidents.

A housing movement began to form during this time. The movement arose out of necessity because it was pointed out that chapter meetings were being conducted in rented halls. Even though the housing movement had been gaining momentum, it was not until the 1892 convention that a resolution was passed that advocated that all chapters rent or own at least one house. In the last two decades of the 19th century, over fifty chapter houses were acquired.

For a brief period, a resolution was set forth to allow chapters to initiate women. First proposed in 1869, this was considered a radical idea both from a fraternal standpoint and social one as well since women were not allowed to vote until 1920. Although it was met with strong opposition, the issue would not be settled for several years.

During the two decades from 1870 to 1890, the growth of the fraternity was rapid, due principally to the efforts of Palmer and Banta. The two were given the title &quot;Second Founders&quot; for their work. In the 1870s alone, 34 new chapters were established, but this was also a period of uncertainty because of the anti-fraternity sentiment held by many faculty in schools where Phi Delta Theta had chapters. Several chapters became dormant because of this. Still, the fraternity was aided by the absorption of local fraternities that sought national membership, including a merger that absorbed five chapters of Kappa Sigma Kappa in . The fraternity continued steady growth, and by 1889, there were 66 chapters in 27 states.

===20th century===
With constant expansion into the Western United States, Phi Delta Theta became an international fraternity when the organization&#x27;s first chapter in Canada, the &quot;Quebec Alpha&quot;, was installed at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec on April 5, 1902. Phi Delta Theta was being a founding member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, in 1910. By 1918, there were 78 chapters with a membership of 77,000.

At the outbreak of World War I, college administrators urged its undergraduate members to stay in school. However, many were eager to enlist. The first Phis to fight in the war were members of the chapters at the University of Toronto and McGill University, the fraternity&#x27;s only Canadian chapters during that period. By the time the United States entered the war in 1917, over 5000 Phis served in the conflict with 155 of them losing their lives. Because many of the undergraduate Phis put their studies on hold, many chapter houses either had limited occupants or none at all. To prevent losing houses pending the return of Phis from the war, many housing corporations consented to have the houses used as barracks or for YMCA programs.

During the 1920s and 1930s, expansion was carefully controlled. Focus was placed on re-activating chapters whose charters were revoked years earlier.

World War II exacted a heavy toll on the membership and operations of the fraternity. Many undergraduate members joined the military, and 13 chapters were closed. As active membership declined, most of the Phi Delt houses were used as women&#x27;s residence halls or became makeshift military quarters. A newsletter, &quot;The Fighting Phi News&quot;, was sent to members whose contact information was known to the fraternity. 

Fifty Phi generals and admirals served in the United States and Canada during the conflict, the most for any fraternity. Prominent among them were General Edward P. King, leader of the U.S. and Filipino forces in Bataan, Philippines; Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the Guadalcanal campaign; and Admiral John S. McCain Sr., commander of carrier task forces in the Pacific. Members of Phi Delta Theta also received every major military decoration in both the United States and British Commonwealth forces, including the Medal of Honor (MOH) awarded to Leon Vance of the Army Air Corps and the Victoria Cross (VC) to Robert Hampton Gray, a Canadian naval aviator. Vance&#x27;s MOH was the last to be awarded before the D-Day landings, and Gray was both the last military personnel to receive the VC in the war and the last Canadian to lose his life during the war.
Members of the fraternity also played a crucial role on the home front. Among those were Elmer Davis, the head of the Office of War Information; Byron Price, the head of the Office of Censorship; and Ted Gamble, the National Director of the War Finance Division.

When World War II ended, the fraternity experienced a surge in membership as many veterans attended college under the GI Bill. On December 15, 1945, the groundbreaking of the present-day General Headquarters building took place. One of the features of the headquarters was a permanent war memorial honoring all Phis who lost their lives during WWII and previous wars.

After the end of World War II, the fraternity was confronted with the social changes sweeping college campuses in the United States. Like many fraternities, Phi Delta Theta had a restrictive clause barring membership to African-Americans, Asians, Jews, and Muslims. Specifically the term &quot;white persons of full Aryan blood&quot; was the subject of strong opposition among many members in light of Nazi ideology in the recently fought war, although there had been dissenting voices regarding this long before the clause became controversial among its members. This clause was added to the Code of Phi Delta Theta in 1910. However, by the 1946 convention, there was an open discussion regarding this topic. Impassioned sentiment from many alumni as well as undergraduates coupled with the changing demographic of the college scene caused Phi Delta Theta to re-examine its membership. Years of debate followed; however, by 1954, Phi Delta Theta eliminated the clause and became one of the first fraternities to eliminate any restriction based on race, color, or creed. Only a year earlier, Phi Delta Theta had suspended its chapters at Amherst and Williams College for pledging minorities.

The 1950s saw a period of rapid growth and an expansion of the internal operations of the fraternity. Twelve new schools were granted chapter status. An important change in leadership also occurred during this time. In 1955, Paul Beam, the executive vice president of the fraternity (the head of the fraternity&#x27;s daily operations) unexpectedly died. He had succeeded the position of Arthur R. Priest who had served 1923–1937. Beam guided the fraternity through eight conventions and the trials of World War II. Bob Miller, who was Beam&#x27;s assistant, was eventually chosen to take over by the General Council and assumed the office almost immediately. He would go on to serve for 36 years, which is currently the longest term served in that office.

Two important programs were developed during this period that would profoundly affect the fraternity&#x27;s services. Before Beam died, he and several province presidents proposed a leadership convention for undergraduate members. These conventions would cover topics ranging from chapter organization to effective leadership. The first such convention was set up in 1956. At the time, it only involved 16 chapters. From 1956 until 1987, these sessions were held on a regional basis. The gatherings would form the basis of the Leadership College founded in 1987. 1958 was an important year for the fraternity because an educational foundation was created, the main purpose of which was to provide scholarships to deserving students.

During the turbulent 1960s, Phi Delta Theta along with other social fraternities dealt with a strong anti-fraternity sentiment from people who saw the Greek-lettered communities as old-world-established institutions. This sentiment was not without reason. Although Phi Delta Theta attempted to revise its restrictive membership codes in the wake of World War II, as late as 1961 the national office made headlines by rejecting the pledge of a Jewish student at Lake Forest College. Later that same year the University of Wisconsin banned Phi Delta Theta from campus for barring Jews, African-Americans, and other minorities from membership.

Despite an overall decline in fraternity membership during the late 1960s, Phi Delta Theta continued to expand through a carefully controlled process known as &quot;colonization.&quot; In 1968, a historic initiation took place when Robert Wise, Academy Award winning director of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;, was initiated in the Franklin College chapter. Wise had completed all membership requirements in 1932 but was forced to withdraw from college due to a lack of funds. Roger D. Branigin, the Governor of Indiana at the time and Phi Delt member, presided over the ceremonies. 1969 was an eventful year for the fraternity as Neil Armstrong, a graduate from the Purdue University chapter, became the first man to walk on the Moon. During the Moon landing, Armstrong carried with him a fraternity badge, which he subsequently donated to the General Headquarters of the fraternity. He also donated a small silk flag of the fraternity, which he carried with him on his Gemini flight in 1966.

As war raged in Vietnam, Phis again served in the armed forces. With the emergence of new technology, a significant percentage opted to become fighter pilots. The Vietnam War saw a small dip in the Fraternity&#x27;s membership; however, by 1972, the fraternity had 140 active chapters with over 128,000 initiates. An important change was made during the 1970s that gave more autonomy to chapters in terms of membership selection. An amendment was passed wherein the unanimous vote rule to allow a college man to become a pledge was changed to allow individual chapters to decide on their own which method best suited their respective chapters. In 1973, the fraternity celebrated its 125th anniversary. The special occasion was marked by the construction of the university gates at Miami University. To date, nine buildings on the campus were either constructed by Phi Delta Theta or named after members.

The 1980s saw the fraternity deal with issues such as hazing, rising insurance costs, and maintenance of individual chapter operations. The unofficial theme of the 1980 convention was &quot;Eliminate Hazing.&quot; The decade was marked by an increase in lawsuits dealing with hazing and alcohol abuse among many fraternities. To deal with this issue, Phi Delta Theta instituted a comprehensive insurance policy to protect its chapters. During the 1980s, an important aspect of the fraternity was created: Leadership consultants. The consultants, who are recent college graduates, travel to assigned provinces and assist various chapters in many aspects of fraternity life and chapter operations. They also report the status of each visited chapter to the general headquarters.

An important leadership change occurred at the beginning of the 1990s when Robert Biggs became the fourth executive vice president of the fraternity after Robert Miller stepped down. During the decade, Phi Delta Theta and many other fraternities experienced a decline in membership. The most important policy to be implemented by the fraternity during the decade was the decision made in 1997 to have all chapter facilities alcohol free by 2000. It was an initiative that was strongly pursued by the 1996–1998 General Council. The policy was in response to the growing insurance claims against the fraternity, 53% of which were alcohol-related, and a return to the core values of the organization.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002, Phi Delta Theta, along with Kappa Sigma and Phi Sigma Kappa left the North American Interfraternity Conference due to ideological differences. Fraternity officials had been concerned of the direction of the conference for six years before leaving. Phi Delta Theta officials believed that the conference had been placing too much emphasis on individual undergraduates through specific programs such as leadership conferences rather than focusing on the fraternity movement as a whole. Phi Sigma Kappa has since re-joined the NIC.

In 2005, the fraternity issued a progress report. Significant improvements have occurred in many areas of fraternity life and operations. Since the implementation of the alcohol-free housing policy, the undergraduate grade point average rose from 2.77 in 2000 to nearly 3.00 in 2005. The insurance premiums of individual members have also gone down as risk management violations have decreased. Perhaps the most telling area is in membership, where Phi Delta Theta showed an increase in new members. In 2004, Phi Delta Theta had 3,102 new members while other fraternities averaged 2,415. In 1990, chapters of Phi Delta Theta were 18% larger than the typical fraternity chapter. In 2004, they were 30% larger. Also, in 2004, Phi Delta Theta was one of only 13 national/international fraternities to show an increase in total undergraduates from the previous year with an increase of 4.2%. The significance of this is highlighted by the fact that Phi Delta Theta had fewer chapters than other fraternities. Competitively, Phi Delta Theta has remained a constant among others. In terms of new members, it ranked ninth in 1990, eighth in 2000, and ninth in 2004. Many alumni members have credited the alcohol-free housing policy with continuing this trend.

== Publications ==
&quot;The Scroll&quot; of Phi Delta Theta is the official magazine for members of the fraternity. The award-winning magazine has been published continuously since 1875. It is the second oldest continuously published fraternity magazine behind the official magazine of Beta Theta Pi, which was first published three years before. Members receive lifetime subscriptions to &quot;The Scroll&quot;. The magazine covers topical issues relating to Phi Delta Theta and the wider fraternity world, news of prominent alumni, alumni club meeting reports, and undergraduate chapter reports. While its focus is Phi Delta Theta, readership is open to non-members. Since its inception, issues have been published 2–4 times a year.

The &quot;Palladium&quot; was a private magazine specifically for members of Phi Delta Theta. Unlike&quot; The Scroll&quot;, the &quot;Palladium&quot; was intended to be read by Phis only. The magazine covered topics such as fraternity policy, reports, and minutes to conventions. It was published only once a year and was a supplement to the winter edition of &quot;The Scroll&quot;. The first issue was printed in 1894 and the last issue was released in the mid-1960s.

The first three pledge manuals of the fraternity were written by Walter B. Palmer. The idea for the manual was conceived by J. Marshall Mayer (City College of New York, 1884), who at the time was the managing editor of the &quot;Scroll&quot;. The first pledge manual was printed in 1886 and contained only 56 pages. Since few copies were published and it is the first membership manual of any fraternity, it is regarded as one of the most rare and valuable books of its kind. The 4th–6th editions were authored by Arthur R. Priest. Much of the present-day material is derived from these editions.

== Membership ==
Membership in Phi Delta Theta is open to all qualified men without concern for race, religion, or ethnicity. Initial membership to the fraternity is contingent upon receiving an invitation to an interested individual from members of an active chapter. A pledge of Phi Delta Theta is called a &quot;Phikeia&quot;. The typical pledge period lasts a minimum of eight weeks, although occasionally it is shortened or lengthened to fit university requirements or by approval of the General Council. The pledge period is a time where the prospective member learns about the fraternity history, structure, traditions, organization as well as social etiquette. Phi Delta Theta has a strict policy against hazing and does not tolerate chapters that violate the policy. Once initiated, a brother is entitled to all rights and privileges of fraternity membership unless he formally resigns or is expelled.

== Governance ==
All powers of the fraternity, both legislative and supreme, rest within the General Convention. The convention is a biennial event attended by representatives of undergraduate chapters, alumni chapters, and various foundations. The purpose of the convention is to discuss and vote on a wide range of issues affecting the fraternity. The convention is held in various cities across North America. It is also during the convention where the General Council is elected.

The General Council is the governing body of Phi Delta Theta. Its all-volunteer members are elected every two years during the fraternity&#x27;s convention. Their chief responsibility is to act as the executive and administrative board of the fraternity. Their duties include the granting and suspending of charters.

The General Headquarters (GHQ) is responsible for the daily operations of the fraternity. Among its many duties, GHQ collects dues, distributes supplies, and tries to maintain up-to-date information about all its members. Unlike other entities within the fraternity, the staff of GHQ are paid for their services. While the main offices of GHQ are held by members of the fraternity, support staff need not be members. The head of GHQ is the executive vice president, who acts as the secretary to the General Council.

==Educational foundation and programs==
Phi Delta Theta and many other fraternities have an educational foundation fund. Part of the Phi Delta Theta Foundation&#x27;s aim is to award scholarships to deserving undergraduate members and those pursuing advanced degrees in various graduate schools. Each year, it provides over $150,000 in scholarships. The foundation is also essential in supporting programs such as the Emerging Leaders Institute, the Leadership Consultant Program, and portions of the General Convention as well as &quot;The Scroll&quot;, the official magazine of the fraternity. The foundation, which was established in 1962 with only $4,708, has since grown to over $14 million.

===Kleberg Emerging Leaders Institute===
The Kleberg Emerging Leaders Institute (Kleberg) is an annual event held at the Fraternity&#x27;s headquarters during the summer where newly initiated undergraduates are instructed leadership classes, as well as participating in programs that help to improve their respective chapters. It is attended by selected undergraduates from every chapter. It is mainly geared toward newly initiated members. The institute was established after the Leadership College was dissolved. The event was renamed in honor of Tio Kleberg, &quot;Texas Tech &#x27;69&quot; after a one-million-dollar donation in 2012.

===Philanthropy===
For many years, Phi Delta Theta had no &quot;official&quot; philanthropy. The fraternity, however, was long associated with the ALS Association (ALSA) because of Lou Gehrig, an alumnus who died of the disease. Amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating neuro-muscular disease and has since become known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. Although there had always existed a relationship between ALSA and Phi Delta Theta, it was not until November 2002 that the General Council made the partnership official. Undergraduate and alumni chapters from all across North America regularly organize events to raise money for research. In August 2017, Phi Delta Theta terminated its partnership with ALSA and elected to proceed with creating its ALS-related charity. But now they have elected to work closely with the LiveLikeLou Foundation to succeed in leaving ALS better than they found it.

== Affiliations ==
Phi Delta Theta has the distinction of having close connections with two sororities: Delta Gamma and Delta Zeta. George Banta Sr., a Phi Delt from Franklin-Indiana, was instrumental in expanding the Delta Gamma sorority. For his efforts, he was the only man ever initiated into Delta Gamma. Banta would later perform initiation ceremonies for new members of the sorority, including Lillian Vawter, his fiancée. Guy Potter Benton, a graduate of the Phi Delt chapter at Ohio Wesleyan University, was president of Miami University in 1902 when he helped with the founding of Delta Zeta. Dr. Benton aided in the preparation of a ritual, badge, and colors. He was a great assistance to Delta Zeta and at one point chased down a man who stole the newly formed ritual of the sorority. For his work, Delta Zeta named him the Grand Patron of the sorority and is the only man to ever wear the Delta Zeta badge. To this day, an amiable friendship exists between Phi Delta Theta and these two sororities.

== Famous firsts ==
Phi Delta Theta instituted several policies and traditions that are not only still used by the fraternity today, but have also become standard among almost all fraternities, as well as sororities.

* First fraternity to adopt a pledge pin – 
* First fraternity to adopt an alumnus pin – 
* First fraternity to adopt a pledge manual – 
* First fraternity to adopt a National Day of Celebration – 
* First fraternity to adopt life subscriptions to the fraternity magazine – 
* First national fraternity to expand west of the Mississippi River – 
* First fraternity to have a member walk on the Moon – 

==Controversies==
===19th century===
* In 1852, the Kappa chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) was formed at Miami University after a disagreement among Phi Delta Theta members over prohibiting alcohol. In 1854, two years later, another disagreement in this group led to another break-away. A schism over who would become a Poet for the Erodelphian Literary Society led to the founding of Sigma Chi in 1855.

===20th century===
* In 1924, Charles Lamkin, a former international president of Phi Delta Theta, was instrumental in the formation of a new national fraternity called Theta Kappa Nu, and in recruiting some 30 local fraternities to become chapters of Theta Kappa Nu during its first two years. No mention was made in print of his work at the time (obviously a sensitive issue); but he was listed, along with the Four Founders of Theta Kappa Nu, as one of the first five to have a lifetime subscription to the fraternity&#x27;s magazine. Having chartered 55 chapters, Theta Kappa Nu merged with Lambda Chi Alpha in 1939.

===21st century===
*In June 2000, when Phi Delta Theta announced the inception of an alcohol-free housing policy, the announcement was met both with hope and skepticism. While some saw the banning of alcohol in housing facilities as a welcome return to the principles on which the fraternity was founded, others felt the drastic cultural shift would hurt social dynamics. The General Council and GHQ had expected resistance from both alumni and undergraduate members when it was first proposed. Among the most vocal chapters against the policy were the University of Virginia chapter, where a faction split off from Phi Delta Theta and chose to form a separate local fraternity known as the Phi Society, and the University of the South chapter, which formed the Phi Society of 1883 rather than adopt the policy. Phi Delta Theta returned to the University of Virginia one year later and formed a new chapter that operates alongside the still active Phi Society Chapter. Phi Delta Theta has not returned to the University of the South.

* In 2012, a new member at Northwestern University was hospitalized with a broken nose fractured in four places as a result of being forced by the fraternity to participate in a fight as hazing. After an investigation of this and other hazing incidents, the fraternity chapter was placed on deferred suspension until June 17, 2016.
* In 2013, Emory University voted to ban the fraternity from the campus for four years due to repeated hazing violations and misconduct. New members were forced to participate in &quot;fight club&quot;, and &quot;successfully&quot; consume high amounts of alcohol to prove their masculinity and sleep on the floor in the fraternity house&#x27;s basement in only their underwear.
* In 2016, the chapter at the University of Chicago was sued by a former new member who alleged hazing.
* In 2016, the chapter at Baylor University was suspended after its president, Jacob Walter Anderson, was charged with sexual assault and rape of a woman who was unconscious at a party the fraternity hosted. The fraternity was cited for providing alcohol to underage students.
* In 2017, the chapter at Louisiana State University was suspended, along with all Greek life at LSU (per university president), after a new member was rushed to the hospital where he later succumbed to alcohol poisoning and died. Suspected hazing; alcohol abuse in addition to THC was found in his urine. Later, ten people were arrested and charged with hazing, and one was charged with negligent homicide in the death.
* In 2018, the chapter at Washington University in St. Louis was permanently suspended after an AR-15 semi-automatic weapon was found in the house. They had previously been temporarily suspended because of a hazing incident and had repeatedly violated this suspension by hosting unsanctioned social events.
* In 2022, the chapter at University of Kansas was suspended for several years due to extreme verbal, emotional, and physical abuse of pledges. One of several disturbing incidents reported included a pledge being strong-armed into watching a video with a gruesome scene of a dolphin&#x27;s slaughter. That pledge&#x27;s name, from then on, became “Dolphin.”

== Notable members ==
: &quot;See List of Phi Delta Theta members&quot;

Members of Phi Delta Theta have held numerous political positions in the United States, including the presidency, vice presidency, and speakership of the House of Representatives. In Canada, fraternity members have served in many levels of government. Members have won major awards in science and entertainment, and have also gained prominence in areas such as architecture, medicine, and sports. Throughout the years, many prominent members have kept a vested interest in the events and operations of Phi Delta Theta. President Harrison, for example, participated in three Phi Delt banquets during his presidency while Medal of Honor recipient General Frederick Funston was the guest speaker at certain chapter installations.

===By the numbers===
The number of members who have either been involved in armed conflict or have achieved prominence in their respective professions has been documented throughout the years. As of November 2014, the following statistics are the involvement of its members in various fields:

===Sports awards named after members===
* Grantland Rice Trophy – presented by the Football Writers Association of America to the National Champions of college football
* Doak Walker Trophy – presented to College Football&#x27;s top Running Back by The Southern Methodist University Forum.
* John Outland Trophy – first presented in 1946 by the Football Writers Association of America, honoring the nation&#x27;s outstanding interior lineman
* Lou Gehrig Memorial Award – presented to the Major League Baseball player best exemplifying the giving characteristic of Lou Gehrig both on and off the field
* The Davis Cup – named after Dwight F. Davis; the largest annual international team competition in tennis; one of the cornerstones of the tennis year, this prestigious event gives players the chance to represent their country in an otherwise individual sport

==Chapters==
===Undergraduate chapters===

: &quot;See List of Phi Delta Theta chapters&quot;

Since 1848, Phi Delta Theta has granted more than 285 charters across the United States and Canada. Today, there are over 191 active chapters and colonies. To be granted a charter, a colony must complete certain requirements set forth by the General Council. Chief among these are recruiting a certain number of members and achieving a respectable cumulative grade point average among its members. Phi Delta Theta also has the longest continuous chapter of any fraternity in the United States, that chapter being the &quot;Kentucky Alpha Delta chapter&quot; at Centre College, which was established in 1850 and is still active today. The largest chapter of Phi Delta Theta is at Indiana University with, on average, 160 active brothers and has been active since 1849.

===Alumni chapters===
Currently, Phi Delta Theta has over 100 active alumni clubs. Although all the clubs are currently in North America, alumni clubs have been found all over the world throughout its history. At one point, there were over 165 alumni chapters, some as far away as China. The most Phis to ever assemble on foreign land for an alumni club meeting, before the fraternity became international in 1902, was in Manila, Philippines when 30 Phis gathered in 1899. The alumni club in the Philippines lasted for nearly 40 years.

<doc id="1267348" wikidata="Q16151850" url="?curid=1267348" title="James Mason (neo-Nazi)">
<text>James Nolan Mason (born July 25, 1952) is an American neo-Nazi. Mason is an ideologue for the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi terrorist organization. After growing disillusioned with the mass movement approach of neo-Nazi movements, he began advocating for a white supremacist revolution through terrorism. He was referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Fascist Terrorism&quot; in the &quot;Fair Observer&quot;. He has been convicted of assault and weapons charges, as well as charged with sexual exploitation and possession of pornographic images of a minor. In 2021, Mason was one of only two individuals sanctioned by the Canadian Government on its list of terror-related entities.

==Early life and activism==

Mason grew up in Chillicothe, Ohio. In &quot;Siege&quot;, Mason recounted having been interested in politics at a young age, describing how his father once took him to a Richard Nixon rally in 1960. He would continue to support mainstream conservative politicians like Barry Goldwater and eventually populist ones like George Wallace. Mason described this as the last instance of himself supporting mainstream political parties. In 1966, when he was 14 years old, he joined the youth movement of George Lincoln Rockwell&#x27;s American Nazi Party (ANP). In 1968, when he was 16, Mason planned to murder the principal and other staff members at his high school. Instead, following the advice of William Luther Pierce, he quit school and began working at the ANP headquarters in Virginia.

After the assassination of Rockwell in 1967, Mason aligned himself with the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party (NSWPP) and Joseph Tommasi&#x27;s National Socialist Liberation Front (NSLF). Mason was one of the younger members of the American Nazi Party in 1966, taking inspiration from George Lincoln Rockwell&#x27;s leadership. In 1970, at the age of 18, Mason became a full-fledged member of the NSWPP and returned to Chillicothe.

In the early 1980s, Mason began corresponding with Sandra Good and Lynette Fromme, two followers of Charles Manson. In 1982, along with Manson, Mason founded Universal Order, an organization that encouraged terror with notoriety, similar to that achieved by the Manson Family. In this correspondence with Manson&#x27;s associates, Mason began to venerate the work of Charles Manson. This obsession was inspired by &quot;the Manson Family&#x27;s attempt to start a race war which they would wait out in the desert; their leader&#x27;s racism, antisemitism, and female following; and his popularity among rebellious young people, whom Mason hoped to recruit.&quot; Manson also designed the logo of the Universal Order.

==Criminal charges and convictions==
In 1973, Mason and fellow neo-Nazi Greg Hurles deployed tear gas against several black teenagers in the parking lot of a Dairy Queen. Mason was convicted of assault and sentenced to six months in a Cincinnati workhouse.

In 1988 and 1991, police raided Mason&#x27;s home in Ohio and seized pornographic photos of a 15-year-old girl. In 1992, he pleaded guilty to two counts of &quot;illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material&quot;, for which he was sentenced to a $500 fine and a suspended sentence.

In May 1994, Mason was arrested and charged with two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. His relationship with the 15-year-old girl began after his book release in 1993. He was connected to this girl in December of 1993, having met her father through his neo-Nazi affiliations in 1977. The relationship ended with Mason&#x27;s arrest in March of 1994. Mason threatened his ex-girlfriend, who was then 16 years old, and a Latino man whom she had been dating, with a firearm. Mason struck a plea bargain and was convicted of weapons charges, for which he was sentenced to three years of incarceration before being released in August 1999.

== Time in prison ==
While in prison, his neo-Nazi writings continued, now centering on what can be described as &quot;racist UFO-Christian spiritual beliefs&quot; until 2004. Mason was published by the &quot;Resistance&quot; in spring of 1995 while in prison. He subsequently wrote 24 articles for &quot;WAR&quot; from 1995 to 1997, a neo-Nazi organization founded by Tom Metzger. One of Mason&#x27;s supporters ultimately created a website &quot;Universal Order&quot; to consolidate his writings and display them on the internet in 1997.

Mason recounted his time in prison as follows: &quot;Basically I had a good time because the Colorado prison system is one of the most advanced in the country. You can meet quite a few interesting people.&quot;

==Atomwaffen Division==
Mason&#x27;s writings in the &quot;Siege&quot; newsletter, which have been compiled into a book of the same name, have been credited with forming a large part of the Atomwaffen Division&#x27;s ideological foundation. In an interview with Frontline, Mason claimed he was approached by members of the Atomwaffen Division who wished to recruit him as an ideological advisor to which he obliged. He asserts that he has no role in orchestrating plots connected to the group, but simultaneously refuses to condemn attacks linked to them. Mason would later mention in a separate interview with MSNBC that members have often disclosed to him their intentions to commit acts of violence, including Sam Woodward, who was later charged with the murder of Blaze Bernstein. 

On March 14, 2020, Mason claimed that the Atomwaffen Division had disbanded. However, the group was believed to be on the cusp of being designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department, and the Anti-Defamation League concluded &quot;the move is designed to give members breathing room rather than actually end their militant activities&quot;. According to SITE Intelligence Group, Atomwaffen and its offshoots remain clandestinely active.

Mason has also been known to receive foreign admirers in his Denver home, including members of the Nordic Resistance Movement, a proscribed Finnish terrorist organization, and affiliated neo-Nazi music collective &quot;Bolt of Ukko&quot;.

==Political views==

Mason believes that the neo-Nazis cannot take power as long as the existing U.S. government remains in place, and has advocated murder and violence to create chaos, thereby destabilizing the government. In his publication &quot;Siege&quot;, Mason argued the death of American Nazi Leader, George Lincoln Rockwell was crucial in the adoption of terror tactics. He claimed that without Rockwell&#x27;s leadership, National Socialism could no longer function as a legitimate political party, making what he describes as &quot;revolutionary tactics&quot; the only viable option.

Mason considers the terrorists Timothy McVeigh and James Fields Jr. to be &quot;heroes&quot; and promulgates anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. He expressed that the election of Donald Trump gave him hope, commenting that &quot;in order to Make America Great Again, you have to make it White again&quot;.

== Writing ==
Mason&#x27;s writings are considered influential among radical right-wing and neo-Nazi movements. Between 1978 and 1980, he worked with the NSWPP and edited &quot;The Stormer&quot;, their newsletter.

In 1980, Mason took over writing &quot;Siege&quot;, the newsletter of the NSLF. He continued publishing until 1986. In the newsletter, Mason paid tribute to Adolf Hitler, Joseph Tommasi, Charles Manson, and Savitri Devi, and advocated random attacks and murders in order to destabilize society. In 1992, the newsletters were edited and published in book form as &quot;Siege: The Collected Writings of James Mason&quot; by Michael Jenkins Moynihan. The book acquired a neo-Nazi following and is now required reading for initiates of the Atomwaffen Division. Since August 2023, &quot;Siege&quot; is banned in the Russian Federation as extremist material.&quot;&quot;

In 2000, he published &quot;The Theocrat&quot;, a comparison of Bible passages and passages in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

== Designation as a terrorist ==
On June 25, 2021, Mason was added to the entities designated as terrorist by Canada. Mason is only the second individual to be specifically added to the list.

<text>Johann (Hans) Schiltberger (1380) was a German traveller and writer. He was born of a noble family, probably at Hollern near Lohhof halfway between Munich and Freising.

== Travels==

Schiltberger joined the suite of Lienhart Richartinger in 1394, and he then went to fight under Sigismund, King of Hungary (afterwards emperor), against the Ottoman Empire on the Hungarian frontier. At the Battle of Nicopolis on 28 September 1396, he was wounded and taken prisoner; when Schiltberger had recovered the use of his feet, Sultan Bayezid I (Yıldırım) took him into his service as a runner (1396–1402). He was factually a military slave for over twenty years. During this time of enslavement he seems to have accompanied Ottoman troops to certain parts of Asia Minor and to Egypt.

On Bayezid&#x27;s overthrow at the Battle of Ankara (20 July 1402), Schiltberger passed into the service of Bayezid&#x27;s conqueror Timur: he now appears to have followed Timur to Samarkand, Armenia and Georgia. After Timur&#x27;s death (17 February 1405) his German runner first became a slave of Shah Rukh, the ablest of Timur&#x27;s sons; then of Miran Shah, a brother of Shah Rukh; then of Abu Bekr, a son of Miran Shah, whose camp roamed up and down Armenia.

Schiltberger next accompanied Chekre, a Tatar prince living in Abu Bekr&#x27;s horde, on an excursion to Siberia, of which name Schiltberger gives us the first clear mention in west European literature. He also probably followed his new master in his attack on the Old Bulgaria of the middle Volga, answering to the modern Kazan and its neighborhood. Wanderings in the steppe lands of south-east Russia; visits to Sarai, the old capital of the Kipchak Khanate on the lower Volga and to Azov or Tana, still a trading centre for Venetian and Genoese merchants; a fresh change of servitude on Chekre&#x27;s ruin; travels in the Crimea, Circassia, Abkhazia and Mingrelia; and finally escape (from the neighborhood of Batum) followed.

Arriving at Constantinople, Schiltberger stayed in hiding there for a time; he then returned to his Bavarian home (1427) by way of Kilia, Akkerman, Lemberg, Kraków, Breslau and Meissen. After his return he became a chamberlain of Duke Albert III, probably receiving this appointment in the first instance before the duke&#x27;s accession in 1438. The date of his death is unknown, but sources give tentatively suggest he died around 1440.

== Writings ==
Schiltberger&#x27;s &quot;Reisebuch&quot; contains not only a record of his own experiences and a sketch of various chapters of contemporary Eastern history, but also an account of countries and their manners and customs, especially of those countries which he had himself visited. First come the lands &quot;this side&quot; of the Danube, where he had travelled; next follow those between the Danube and the sea, which had now fallen under the Turk; after this, the Ottoman dominions in Asia; last come the more distant regions of Schiltberger&#x27;s world, from Trebizond to Russia and from Egypt to India. In this regional geography the descriptions of Brusa; of various west Caucasian and Armenian regions; of the regions around the Caspian, and the habits of their peoples (especially the Red Tatars); of Siberia; of the Crimea with its great Genoese colony at Kaffa (where he once spent five months); and of Egypt and Arabia, are particularly worth notice. His allusions to the Catholic missions still persisting in Armenia and in other regions beyond the Black Sea, and to (non-Roman ?) Christian communities even in the Great Tatary of the steppes are also remarkable.

Schiltberger is perhaps the first writer of Western Christendom to give the true burial place of Muhammad at Medina: his sketches of Islam and of Eastern Christendom, with all their shortcomings, are of remarkable merit for their time: and he may fairly be reckoned among the authors who contributed to fix Prester John, at the close of the Middle Ages, in Abyssinia. Schiltberger also recorded one of the first European sightings of Przewalski horses. (Manuscript in the Munich Municipal Library, Sign. 1603, Bl. 210). His work, however, contains many inaccuracies; thus in reckoning the years of his service both with Bayezid and with Timur he is off unaccountably in multiples of two.

His account of Timur and his campaigns is misty, often incorrect, and sometimes fabulous: nor can von Hammer&#x27;s parallel between Marco Polo and Schiltberger be sustained without large reservations. Four manuscripts of the &quot;Reisebuch&quot; exist: (i) at Donaueschingen in the Fürstenberg Library, No. 481; (2) at Heidelberg, University Library, 216; (3) at Nuremberg, City Library, 34; (4) at St Gall, Monast. Library, 628 (all of fifteenth century, the last fragmentary).

The work was first edited at Augsburg, about 1460; four other editions appeared in the 15th century, and six in the 16th; in the 19th the best were K. F. Neumann&#x27;s (Munich, 1859), P. Bruun&#x27;s (Odessa, 1866, with Russian commentary, in the Records of the Imperial University of New Russia, vol. i.), and V. Langmantel&#x27;s (Tübingen, 1885); &quot;Hans Schiltbergers Reisebuch,&quot; in the 172nd volume of the &quot;Bibliothek des literarischen Vereins&quot; in Stuttgart.

<doc id="1267357" wikidata="Q1306424" url="?curid=1267357" title="A Wedding (1978 film)">
<text>A Wedding is a 1978 American satirical comedy-drama film directed by Robert Altman, with an ensemble cast that includes Desi Arnaz, Jr., Carol Burnett, Paul Dooley, Vittorio Gassman, Mia Farrow, Lillian Gish, Geraldine Chaplin, Howard Duff, Nina Van Pallandt, Amy Stryker, and Pat McCormick. The story is told in typical Altman style, with multiple plots and overlapping humorous dialogue.

The story takes place in a single day during a lavish wedding that merges a nouveau riche Southern family with an established wealthy Chicago family having possible ties to organized crime.

==Plot==
Dino Corelli marries Muffin Brenner and attends the reception at the Corelli mansion. Bedridden matriarch Nettie Sloan, mother of Dino&#x27;s mother Regina Sloan Corelli, is being tended by disreputable Dr. Jules Meecham. While speaking with wedding planner Rita Billingsley, Nettie suddenly dies. Meecham informs Dino&#x27;s father, Luigi Corelli, but Luigi is unable to tell his wife Regina because she is mentally unstable. Nettie&#x27;s corpse remains in bed throughout the reception, while various attendees visit her room without realizing she&#x27;s dead. By the time bossy daughter Toni finds out and plans a dramatic announcement, other family members are mostly unsurprised or not even too upset.

The Brenners are a nouveau riche family from Louisville, Kentucky, where Muffin&#x27;s father, &quot;Snooks&quot;, made millions in the trucking industry. The Corellis are an old money family from North Shore Chicago. Because of rumors that Luigi has mob connections, virtually every invitee sent regrets. Only one guest (other than family members) attends. Nevertheless, Rita is determined to run the reception by the book, setting up a receiving line for the one guest and asking family members and staff to go down the line so it will not look empty.

A series of disasters unfolds, including the display of an embarrassing nude portrait of the bride; caterer Ingrid Hellstrom becoming ill, then getting high and causing a disturbance after Meecham gives her a pill; and a tornado when the cake is to be cut, forcing everyone to find shelter in the cellar. Two guests arrive late: the groom and bride&#x27;s disgruntled exes, Tracy Farrell and Wilson Briggs, who bond over their shared anger.

Unsavory family drama unfolds. Regina is a drug addict. Her marriage was arranged by Nettie after Luigi met Regina while working as a waiter in Italy. Luigi was forced to change his name and be estranged from his Italian family for 22 years. His Italian-speaking brother unexpectedly shows up, and when Meecham reminds Luigi that Nettie is dead and can no longer impose the marriage conditions, Luigi is thrilled to see his long-lost brother. Regina&#x27;s sister Clarice has a romance with her African-American butler, Randolph; her other sister, Toni, is married to Mack Goddard, who falls in love at first sight with Tulip Brenner, mother of the bride, and tries to woo her.

Snooks has a borderline incestuous attachment to his nearly mute daughter Buffy, the maid of honor, who speaks at the reception only once, to tell Dino she is pregnant and he is the father. Not wanting to be upstaged by the bride, Buffy disrobes in front of Muffin&#x27;s nude portrait. Dino confides to Wilson about Buffy&#x27;s pregnancy; Wilson tells Tracy, who vindictively spreads the news. Snooks confronts Dino, who admits to sleeping with Buffy but says she also slept with nearly every member of his military-school barracks. Snooks&#x27;s sister from New Jersey, Marge Spar, starts romancing the Corellis&#x27; gardener, while bridesmaid Rosie Bean is unaware her shy friend Shelby Munker is having an affair with Rosie&#x27;s husband Russell.

Muffin and Dino prepare to leave for their honeymoon in a new car, the Corellis&#x27; wedding gift. Muffin is rattled when Rita makes an unexpected pass at her. She then finds Dino in the shower with his groomsman, Reedley Roots, seemingly engaged in a gay sexual encounter. Actually, Dino has passed out drunk and Reedly is just holding him up straight while trying to sober him up. The newlyweds&#x27; car is seen driving away, and the families assume Dino and Muffin left without saying goodbye. Snooks drives his family back to their hotel. They see Dino&#x27;s car wrecked and in flames, and rush back to the mansion to share the awful news. The families are grieving when Muffin and Dino appear from upstairs, having never left because of Dino&#x27;s passing out. When Luigi remembers that the car keys were last seen in Wilson&#x27;s possession, it becomes clear that Wilson (presumably accompanied by Tracy, since she is nowhere to be found), out for revenge, stole the car and died in the crash. Tulip privately declares the incident was God punishing her for sinful thoughts of having an affair with Mack.

Luigi pays his respects to Nettie. He tells her corpse he kept his bargain for 22 years, and no one there knows who he really is. Now he will take his leave. He finds his brother in the bushes, making love with Buffy. Luigi and his brother happily drive away as a half-dressed Buffy waves goodbye.

==Production==
The film was inspired by a remark Altman made while doing publicity for &quot;3 Women&quot;. Upon being asked what his next movie would be, Altman jokingly replied that he was going to shoot a wedding next. Later, Altman and his production assistant decided to follow through on the idea and began planning the film.

The film was shot almost exclusively over an 8-week period at the Lester Armor House in Lake Bluff, Illinois.

The role of Bishop Martin was the final film appearance by longtime actor and director John Cromwell, who died on September 26, 1979, at age 91. Cromwell&#x27;s wife of 33 years, Ruth Nelson, appeared as Aunt Beatrice Sloan Cory.

&quot;A Wedding&quot; was the 100th film in which Lillian Gish appeared.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert gave &quot;A Wedding&quot; 3 1/2 out of 4 stars, writing &quot;It begins in comedy, it moves into realms of social observation, it descends into personal revelations that are sometimes tragic, sometimes comic, and then it ends in a way that turns everything back upon itself. The more you think about what Altman&#x27;s done, the more impressive his accomplishment becomes&quot;. Gene Siskel gave it one-and-a-half stars out of four, writing &quot;Altman mistreats us to one boob after another. He appears not to care for any one of the people involved here. He creates pompous straw men and women and then he ridicules them. It&#x27;s a particularly mean-spirited movie likely to please no one&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Altman&#x27;s loose, seemingly unstructured style backfires in this comedy drama. Even the innovative director-producer&#x27;s legion of fans will be disappointed. Those already not a member of his cult will find this work tedious&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;Altman in &quot;A Wedding&quot;, for all his undifferentiated sport with the upper reaches of the middle class, remains the entertaining satirist rather more than the angry scold. Still we have all come a long way from &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;, and &quot;A Wedding&quot; is an original and funny piece of work&quot;. Jack Kroll of &quot;Newsweek&quot; called it &quot;one of Altman&#x27;s best films, at once one of his funniest and one of his darkest visions of a crazy, contradictory America&quot;. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;Musically and pictorially, Altman can&#x27;t hide his condescension. He has invented a wedding party, ostensibly a misalliance between old but tarnished Midwestern aristocracy and new, uncouth Southern wealth, but that seems to inspire him to nothing but stale jokes and complacent contempt&quot;. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote &quot;There&#x27;s no way to get &quot;into&quot; the movie; it&#x27;s like a busted bag of marbles—people are running every way at once&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69%, based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.

==Awards and nominations==

Burnett won the Best Actress Award at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, Spain&#x27;s equivalent of France&#x27;s Cannes Film Festival.

Burnett won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite All-Around Female Entertainer Film and Television.

Burnett was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture.

<text>In tort law, detinue () is an action to recover for the wrongful taking of personal property. It is initiated by an individual who claims to have a greater right to their immediate possession than the current possessor. For an action in detinue to succeed, a claimant must first prove that he had better right to possession of the chattel than the defendant, and second, that the defendant refused to return the chattel once demanded by the claimant.

Detinue allows for a remedy of damages for the value of the chattel, but unlike most other interference torts, detinue also allows for the recovery of the specific chattel being withheld.

== History ==
Historically, detinue came in two forms: &quot;detinue sur bailment&quot; and &quot;detinue sur trover&quot;.
*In detinue sur bailment, the defendant is in a bailment relationship with the claimant and either refuses to return the chattel or else has negligently or intentionally lost or destroyed it. The onus is on the bailee to prove that the loss of the chattel was not his or her fault.
*In detinue sur trover, the defendant can be any individual in possession of the chattel who refuses to return it to the claimant. A defendant could be a finder or a thief or any innocent third party, and the claimant need only have a better right to possession.

Early writs and forms of action were exceptionally narrow in scope. This is reflective of the basic conservatism of the common law courts in the middle and late medieval period. This was in contrast with the courts of equity, which were creative in producing novel writs for many new fact situations. Compensation in those days was usually not in money, which was rare, but in land, livestock, or furnishings, as these were the typical measures of wealth. What the plaintiff wanted back was the land, cattle or even coins lent. Maitland suggests that in the earliest time the writ of debt seems almost to have been designed to recover identical coins.

The early writ of detinue was specifically designed for recovery of a chattel wrongfully detained, but not an action to recover loss due to a chattel being harmed while the defendant had it.

Two facts marked the early common law actions. They were defective because of the wide field which was excluded. They were also defective because the plaintiff might well think himself entitled to a remedy, but by reason of the procedure find that he went away empty. The defendant to a writ of debt or detinue might bring others with him who would swear that his denial of the claim was true. This was technically called his &quot;wage of law&quot; or &quot;wager of law&quot;. It was enough to dispose of the plaintiff&#x27;s claim. A common way to escape all writs, even the writ of right, as well as debt and detinue was to claim sickness. If the jury found him in bed with his boots off, the custom was to delay the writ for a year and a day.

==Relation to replevin==

One of the oldest actions in the royal courts was replevin which had its roots in the law of customary courts. Strictly speaking, replevin in its original form was a provisional remedy. Its provision was to procure for the plaintiff the return of chattels taken out of his possession until the right to their possession could be decided by a court of law. No doubt, it was designed to avoid quarrels likely to cause a breach of the peace pending a settlement of the dispute about the right to possession. In other words, the rule of law was beginning to replace that of local force of arms and personal conflict as the resolution of disputes over chattels. The action was in direct succession to the efforts made to regulate self-help, which were the origin of the law of tort. The form of legal recourse was in connection of distress (distractio). This was the practice of taking some chattel from the peasant or underling until some action was performed. In the medieval era the services for which distress could be levied were numerous, since the incidents of tenure were then very numerous. Distress was also leviable as damage feasant. When animals strayed and did damage to a neighbor, they could be retained until the damage was made good. Whether or not the distress was levied for rent or for livestock &quot;damage feasant&quot;, the owner of the animals could obtain their release by giving &quot;gage and pledge&quot; – a form of security that the damage would be made good. One peculiarity of distraint lay in the fact that the distrainor did not get any form of legal possession. The goods and chattels were considered to be in the custody of the law. As a result, there was no taking of possession by the distrainor that was unlawful, since no possession was technically inferred.

The action in replevin began to appear in the thirteenth century. It seems clear that originally the action of replevin lay simply where the question to be determined was that of wrongful distress. Excess and abuse of distress was punished.

The mere claim by the distrainor that he had a right to the chattels distrained was a technicality that ended the action in replevin. It was then necessary to re-file using a new writ invented in the early fourteenth century, called the writ de proprietate probanda – a writ &quot;concerning the proof of ownership&quot;.

== Alternatives to replevin==

Since the distrainor did not get possession he was not originally liable in trespass, and the spheres of the two forms of action remained distinct. During the fourteenth century, after some vacillation by judges, it was held that the plaintiff could elect which remedy he chose when the chattels had been distrained. It was also held that replevin could be used in place of the writ of trespass de bonis aspotatis (trespass by the asportation of goods). In reality, there is little evidence this substitution ever occurred with any frequency, if at all. The rule involved interference with the possession of a chattel by the rightful owner. The 1856 case of Mennie v. Blake gives what Harold Potter calls an admirable survey of the law of replevin. There it was stated:

&quot;It seems clear that replevin is not maintainable unless in a case in which there has been first a taking out of the possession of the owner. This stands upon authority and the reason of the thing.&quot; In the Law of Torts, John Fleming wrote: &quot;From medieval times, there has also come down to us a summary process, known as replevin, by which a man out of whose possession goods have been taken may obtain their return until the right to the goods can be determined by a court of law. Replevin arose out of the need of a turbulent society to discourage resort to self help and although for a long time primarily used in disputes about distress between landlord and tenant, it was gradually expanded to cover all cases of allegedly wrongful dispossession. If the plaintiff wanted return of his chattel &quot;in specie&quot;, replevin was a more appropriate remedy than either trespass or trover in which only damages could be recovered. Restoration of the property is, of course, only provisional, pending determination of title.&quot;

It depended upon an original unlawful taking by the way of distraint. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the action of trover largely replaced trespass for wrongful distress. Replevin and trover never completely coincided, because there was a limitation on replevin.

Replevin remains the modern action, albeit defined by statute, for recovery of chattels pending a decision of the right of possession. It lies only where the possession was taken from the plaintiff, whether under colour of legal process or otherwise, by an act having the nature of a trespass.

==Canadian cases distinguishing replevin from detinue ==
&quot;Manitoba Agricultural Credit Corp. v Heaman&quot;, a 1990 Canadian case, the Manitoba Court of Appeal adopted the words of the 1875 Manitoba Administration of Justice Act as having &quot;codified, but not changed, at least in substance the action of replevin&quot; by saying,

In the 1899 case &quot;McGregor v McGregor&quot;, British Columbia Supreme Court justice Irving wrote:

==Medieval detinue==

Detinue was an old form of action which slowly branched off from the action of debt. The action lay for the unlawful detention of ascertained chattels at the instance of a person who was entitled to have possession. The writ was a command to the defendant that he should deliver up to the plaintiff the chattels &quot;quae ei injuste detinet&quot; – &quot;which he unlawfully withholds from him&quot;. The gist of the action was the unlawful detention by the defendant. An example is seen when a borrower might be sued for unlawfully refusing to return a borrowed article.
Ames regarded the action of detinue as essentially an action based upon contract, having its foundation in bailment. Ames&#x27; point is that the action was a means of enforcing an agreement which was recognized by the law. This argument represents the realization of a theory of contract in detinue. Detinue also replaced the more ancient action of res adiratae. According to Bracton the plaintiff could drop the words felony and merely claim that his chattels were in the possession of the defendant. Holdsworth is of the opinion that the gist of this action was unlawful detention. Holdsworth bases this on a case from Bracton&#x27;s notebook in which the plaintiff alleges that &quot;William Nutach in the peace of God and of our Lord the King and of his bailiffs unjustly detains (&quot;injuste detinuit&quot;) from her three pigs which were lost to her.&quot; The action depended upon loss of the chattel, which had come to the hands of a defendant who had refused on demand to give it up. Holdsworth deduces this case was the forerunner of the action in detinue, which also lay to recover a lost chattel. Ames is of the opinion that this case represents not so much an action, but a formal demand made in court for the return of the chattel, which, if denied, could be followed by an appeal. It is certain that an appeal could be substituted after an allegation of &quot;res adiratae&quot; had been made. It is disputed whether proceedings in &quot;res adiratae&quot; could not be brought in royal courts. Holdsworth cites a case from 1292 which seems to fulfill all the requirements of &quot;res adiratae&quot;. &quot;Note that where a thing belonging to a man is lost, he may count that he (the finder) tortiously detains it. Etc. and tortiously for this that whereas he lost the said thing on such a day, etc. he (the loser) on such a day etc., found it in the house of such a one and prayed him to restore the thing but he would not restore it, etc., to his damage, etc.; and if he etc. In this case the demandant must prove by his law (his own hand the twelfth; i.e. wager of law) that he lost the thing.&quot;

Ames said of detinue &quot;In the first place, the count must allege a bailment, and a traverse of this allegation was an answer to the action.&quot; However, there are many instances where allegation of bailment was not necessary for an action in detinue. Holdsworth cites a 1313 case in which the counsel. Toudeby for the defendant pleaded no allegation of bailment, but Scrope, the counsel for the demandant (plaintiff), replied that, if the defendant carried off the chattels and a writ was brought to recover them, it was no answer to say that the chattels had not been bailed to the plaintiff. Still the case turned on the question of bailment. In 1343, the defendant was driven to a traverse in these terms: &quot;We tell you that the horse did not come into our keeping, nor do we detain the horse, as he counts.&quot; In 1410, both counsel agreed that an action of detinue lay whether the chattel was bailed or whether the defendant found it in the road. The plea simply amounted to an assumption that the chattels had come into the hands of the defendant (devenerunt ad manus), and were wrongfully withheld from the plaintiff.

==Detinue sur trover==

During the fifteenth century, this plea gave rise to a special form of the action of detinue known as &quot;detinue sur trover&quot; which should be distinguished from the action of &quot;trespass on the case sur trover&quot;. The latter would be shortened into simple trover. Littleton remarked that the count or plea of &quot;&quot;per interventionem (sur trover)&quot; was a newfound halliday.&quot; The action probably represents the development of a simpler form of pleading in which it was unnecessary to allege by what means the chattel had come into the defendant&#x27;s hands. Nevertheless, the counts &quot;sur bailment&quot; and &quot;sur trover&quot; seem to have had the effect of drawing a distinction between two forms of action, detinue sur trover and detinue sur bailment. This distinction represented the recognition of the two forms of wrongful detention: one based on a purely tortious wrong and the other connected with an agreement between the parties. &quot;Detinue sur trover&quot; is of greater interest in tort because it covers a more general field. It was distinguished from trespass since it did not involve any interference with the physical possession of the plaintiff. It did not depend on a failure to fulfill a condition to return the chattel which had been delivered to the defendant. There was no necessity for an agreement between the parties.

There were certain defects in detinue sur trover. Wager of law was a possible defense in certain kinds of cases. Wager of law involved the use by a defendant of witnesses, some of whom may have had no knowledge of the case to testify. If a large number of these &quot;witnesses&quot; testified, the defendant would prevail. It was a form of sanctioned perjury. The courts began to severely limit wager of law by the middle of the fourteenth century. No action lay where the chattel was returned but in a damaged or impaired condition. In 1478, Catesby said, &quot;And in the same manner I deliver my robes to you to keep for me and you wear them so that they perish, I shall have an action of detinue for in all these cases the property is not altered, and afterwards an action on the case and recover damages for the loss sustained by your using the clothes.&quot; the same opinion was reiterated in 1510 by Serjeant Moore, although an action would lie for trespass on the case. In the cases of a chattel damaged or destroyed, the plaintiff must choose some remedy other than detinue. This was also true if the bailee dealt with the property in an improper manner as noted by Littleton in 1462: &quot;I bail to you my cloak and you burn it, I will have a writ of trespass on the case against you (and not detinue).&quot; It was doubtful whether detinue lay where, after bailment, a third party had destroyed the chattel bailed. The action lay against a bailee who had himself been responsible for the loss, as where a charter had been found by the jury to have been burned. It was disputed whether this remedy applied to the action of a third party. Judge Brian said, &quot;If I bail my horse to a smith to shoe and he bails it to another smith who damages the horse an action will not lie against him.&quot; The second party was a stranger to the bailment, but the other justices were opposed to this opinion of Brian.

By the time of Bracton, the old preference for an action in trespass exclusively was seen to have softened somewhat, with certain actions allowed against a third party in detinue. This began to make wager of law ineffective as a defense. The judges of the time were growing wary of wager of law as a legitimate defense, anyway. This attitude allowing detinue was not universally held, as can be seen from the cases noted in this section.

== Bracton on third party liability ==
In the opinion of Bracton, if goods were unlawfully taken from the possession of the bailee, it was he who had the action against the wrongdoer, not the original bailor. The action was appeal of larceny or trespass. Even in the time of Bracton, there was pressure to change this arrangement and allow the bailor to bring an action directly against the third party. Under the old rules, the bailee had an absolute responsibility to the bailor for safe keeping of the goods. A case from 1200 directed the verdict for lost goods against the bailee who claimed they had been lost and stolen during a fire at his property. Glanvill also held this opinion. Glanvill held that the bailee was absolutely bound to restore the lost chattel or its value. Bracton appeared to mitigate the old rule. If the bailee had shown &quot;due diligence&quot;, there was room for mitigation of damages. However, it was never clear how Bracton would decide to proportion damages. Bracton&#x27;s description has been called &quot;Romanesque&quot;, and premature. Even by Bracton&#x27;s time, lawyers were becoming accustomed to the notion that bailees did not have an absolute liability for chattels bailed to their tending, assuming they used &quot;reasonable care&quot; or &quot;diligence&quot; in handling them. In Bracton&#x27;s text, there was the beginning of the notion that bailee had an action for loss, assuming he had some interest in the chattel beyond mere possession. That must be some kind of responsibility for its care and safety. It had not developed very far. Bracton more than once seems to require that the appellor shall complain of a theft of his own goods or of goods for which he has been made responsible, namely, &quot;intravit in solutionem erga dominum suum&quot;. The time between conveyance and possession was ill-defined. The time of bailee possession was called the &quot;custodia&quot; or &quot;custody&quot;. The bailee had three courses of action: (1) the appeal of larceny; (2) the action of trespass; (3) the action of detinue. Bracton wrote of detinue:

== The question of ownership and possession ==
From a case in 1292, the following was reported:

The question of what was the nature of the action of detinue remained open till the present time.

This case illustrates two points. Ownership was key to determining the kind of action to be brought for remedy. Ownership was unclear, and difficult to define at the end of the thirteenth century.

==Detinue separated from debt ==

Glanvill described one action which had features of both debt and detinue. They were the same. In his time, the form of the writ was a demand for a sum of money which could be issued for various reasons. &quot;Debt&quot; or detinue could be demanded for return of the loan of money, the price of sale, the loan of a chattel, letting to hire, or a deposit. The writ was available for a creditor against a surety on the default of the principal debtor. Glanvill speaks of debt and its writ as being a retrieval of &quot;debt that is due&quot;, or &quot;detinue&quot;. Later, and by the time of Bracton, detinue had been more or less separated from primary actions in debt, Detinue had come to be restricted to actions against bailees. After Bracton, the special situation of &quot;de bonis asportatis&quot;, the taking of chattels by a bailee or theft of these from a bailee gave rise to the special situation of trover. Trover became fully formed in the reign of Elizabeth I. By the end of Bracton&#x27;s life and into the reign of Edward I, debt was confined to contract law, while detinue was concerned with the developing issues of personal property.

==Breaking the bulk ==

Occasionally, the issue of a transporting agent, a bailee who was charged with moving chattels would open the wrapped packages and misappropriate the contents. This was called &quot;breaking the bulk&quot;. In 1315, an action in detinue was allowed for &quot;breaking the bulk&quot;. Later, in 1473, breaking the bulk was determined to be a felony, and not an action in pure detinue.

==Detinue in United States law ==

In the United States, detinue is a possessory action having for its object the recovery of specific personal property and damages for its detention. At common law an action of detinue would lie for the recovery of specific personal property unlawfully detained, or its value, and for damages for its detention. Detinue differs from replevin in that possession of the chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in detinue, whereas in replevin possession is changed at the beginning of the proceeding. The gist of an action in detinue is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession of personal property which belongs to the plaintiff, whereas replevin lies only where there has been a wrongful taking or seizure of the property. Detinue is distinguished from common-law trover which is for the recovery of damages for the wrongful conversion of personal property. In modern practice, detinue has been superseded almost entirely by statutory actions for the recovery of personal property.

== England and Wales ==
In England and Wales, detinue was abolished from 1 January 1978 by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. However, the tort of conversion was extended at the same time to cover circumstances that had previously been covered only by detinue.

<text>In computer networking, Teredo is a Microsoft transition technology that gives full IPv6 connectivity for IPv6-capable hosts that are on the IPv4 Internet but have no native connection to an IPv6 network. Unlike similar protocols such as 6to4, it can perform its function even from behind network address translation (NAT) devices such as home routers. 

Teredo operates using a platform independent tunneling protocol that provides IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) connectivity by encapsulating IPv6 datagram packets within IPv4 User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. Teredo routes these datagrams on the IPv4 Internet and through NAT devices. Teredo nodes elsewhere on the IPv6 network (called Teredo relays) receive the packets, un-encapsulate them, and pass them on.

Teredo is a temporary measure. In the long term, all IPv6 hosts should use native IPv6 connectivity. Teredo should be disabled when native IPv6 connectivity becomes available. Christian Huitema developed Teredo at Microsoft, and the IETF standardized it as RFC 4380. The Teredo server listens on UDP port 3544.

For 6to4, the most common IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling protocol, requires that the tunnel endpoint have a public IPv4 address. However, many hosts currently attach to the IPv4 Internet through one or several NAT devices, usually because of IPv4 address shortage. In such a situation, the only available public IPv4 address is assigned to the NAT device, and the 6to4 tunnel endpoint must be implemented on the NAT device itself. The problem is that many NAT devices currently deployed cannot be upgraded to implement 6to4, for technical or economic reasons.

Teredo alleviates this problem by encapsulating IPv6 packets within UDP/IPv4 datagrams, which most NATs can forward properly. Thus, IPv6-aware hosts behind NATs can serve as Teredo tunnel endpoints even when they don&#x27;t have a dedicated public IPv4 address. In effect, a host that implements Teredo can gain IPv6 connectivity with no cooperation from the local network environment.

In the long term, all IPv6 hosts should use native IPv6 connectivity. The temporary Teredo protocol includes provisions for a &quot;sunset procedure&quot;: Teredo implementation should provide a way to stop using Teredo connectivity when IPv6 matures and connectivity becomes available using a less brittle mechanism. As of IETF89, Microsoft plans to deactivate their Teredo servers for Windows clients in the first half of 2014 (exact date TBD), and encourage the deactivation of publicly operated Teredo relays.

== Overview ==
The Teredo protocol performs several functions:
# Diagnoses UDP over IPv4 (UDPv4) connectivity and discovers the kind of NAT present (using a simplified replacement to the STUN protocol)
# Assigns a globally routable unique IPv6 address to each host using it
# Encapsulates IPv6 packets inside UDPv4 datagrams for transmission over an IPv4 network (this includes NAT traversal)
# Routes traffic between Teredo hosts and native (or otherwise non-Teredo) IPv6 hosts

=== Node types ===
Teredo defines several different kinds of nodes:

; Teredo client: A host that has IPv4 connectivity to the Internet from behind a NAT and uses the Teredo tunneling protocol to access the IPv6 Internet. Teredo clients are assigned an IPv6 address that starts with the Teredo prefix (codice_1).

; Teredo server: A well-known host used for initial configuration of a Teredo tunnel. A Teredo server never forwards any traffic for the client (apart from IPv6 pings), and has therefore modest bandwidth requirements (a few hundred bits per second per client at most), which means a single server can support many clients. Additionally, a Teredo server can be implemented in a fully stateless manner, thus using the same amount of memory regardless of how many clients it supports.

; Teredo relay: The remote end of a Teredo tunnel. A Teredo relay must forward all of the data on behalf of the Teredo clients it serves, with the exception of direct Teredo client to Teredo client exchanges. Therefore, a relay requires a lot of bandwidth and can only support a limited number of simultaneous clients. Each Teredo relay serves a range of IPv6 hosts (e.g. a single campus or company, an ISP or a whole operator network, or even the whole IPv6 Internet); it forwards traffic between any Teredo clients and any host within said range.

; Teredo host-specific relay: A Teredo relay whose range of service is limited to the very host it runs on. As such, it has no particular bandwidth or routing requirements. A computer with a host-specific relay uses Teredo to communicate with Teredo clients, but sticks to its main IPv6 connectivity provider to reach the rest of the IPv6 Internet.

=== IPv6 addressing ===
Each Teredo client is assigned a public IPv6 address, which is constructed as follows (the higher order bit is numbered 0):
* Bits 0 to 31 hold the Teredo prefix (2001::/32).
* Bits 32 to 63 embed the primary IPv4 address of the Teredo server that is used.
* Bits 64 to 79 hold some flags and other bits; the format for these 16 bits, MSB first, is &quot;CRAAAAUG AAAAAAAA&quot;. The &quot;C&quot; bit was set to 1 if the Teredo client is located behind a cone NAT, 0 otherwise, but RFC 5991 changed it to always be 0 to avoid revealing this fact to strangers. The &quot;R&quot; bit is currently unassigned and should be sent as 0. The &quot;U&quot; and &quot;G&quot; bits are set to 0 to emulate the &quot;Universal/local&quot; and &quot;Group/individual&quot; bits in MAC addresses. The 12 &quot;A&quot; bits were 0 in the original RFC 4380 specification, but were changed to random bits chosen by the Teredo client in RFC 5991 to provide the Teredo node with additional protection against IPv6-based scanning attacks.
* Bits 80 to 95 contain the &quot;obfuscated&quot; UDP port number. This is the port number that the NAT maps to the Teredo client, with all bits inverted.
* Bits 96 to 127 contain the &quot;obfuscated&quot; IPv4 address. This is the public IPv4 address of the NAT with all bits inverted.


As an example, the IPv6 address 2001:0000:4136:e378:8000:63bf:3fff:fdd2 refers to a Teredo client that:
* Uses Teredo server at address 65.54.227.120 (4136e378 in hexadecimal)
* Is behind a cone NAT and client is not fully compliant with RFC 5991 (bit 64 is set)
* Is probably (99.98%) not compliant with RFC 5991 (the 12 random bits are all 0, which happens less than 0.025% of the time)
* Uses UDP mapped port 40000 on its NAT (in hexadecimal not 63bf equals 9c40, or decimal number 40000)
* Has a NAT public IPv4 address of 192.0.2.45 (not 3ffffdd2 equals c000022d, which is to say, 192.0.2.45)


=== Servers ===
Teredo clients use Teredo servers to autodetect the kind of NAT they are behind (if any), through a simplified STUN-like &quot;qualification procedure&quot;. Teredo clients also maintain a binding on their NAT toward their Teredo server by sending a UDP packet at regular intervals. That ensures that the server can always contact any of its clients—which is required for NAT hole punching to work properly.

If a Teredo relay (or another Teredo client) must send an IPv6 packet to a Teredo client, it first sends a &quot;Teredo bubble&quot; packet to the client&#x27;s Teredo server, whose IP address it infers from the Teredo IPv6 address of the Teredo client. The server then forwards the &quot;bubble&quot; to the client, so the Teredo client software knows it must do hole punching toward the Teredo relay.

Teredo servers can also transmit ICMPv6 packet from Teredo clients toward the IPv6 Internet. In practice, when a Teredo client wants to contact a native IPv6 node, it must locate the corresponding Teredo relay, &quot;i.e.&quot;, to which public IPv4 and UDP port number to send encapsulated IPv6 packets. To do that, the client crafts an ICMPv6 Echo Request (&quot;ping&quot;) toward the IPv6 node, and sends it through its configured Teredo server. The Teredo server de-capsulates the ping onto the IPv6 Internet, so that the ping should eventually reach the IPv6 node. The IPv6 node should then reply with an ICMPv6 Echo Reply, as mandated by RFC 2460. This reply packet is routed to the &quot;closest&quot; Teredo relay, which — finally — tries to contact the Teredo client.

Maintaining a Teredo server requires little bandwidth, because they are not involved in actual transmission and reception of IPv6 traffic packets. Also, it does not involve any access to the Internet routing protocols. The only requirements for a Teredo server are:
* The ability to emit ICMPv6 packets with a source address belonging to the Teredo prefix
* Two distinct public IPv4 addresses. Though not written down in the official specification, Microsoft Windows clients expect both addresses to be consecutive — the second IPv4 address is for NAT detection

Public Teredo servers:
* teredo.trex.fi (Finland)

Former public Teredo servers:
* teredo.remlab.net / teredo-debian.remlab.net (Germany), now redirects to teredo.trex.fi

=== Relays ===
A Teredo relay potentially requires much network bandwidth. Also, it must export (&quot;advertise&quot;) a route toward the Teredo IPv6 prefix (2001::/32) to other IPv6 hosts. That way, the Teredo relay receives traffic from the IPv6 hosts addressed to any Teredo client, and forwards it over UDP/IPv4. Symmetrically, it receives packets from Teredo clients addressed to native IPv6 hosts over UDP/IPv4 and injects those into the native IPv6 network.

In practice, network administrators can set up a private Teredo relay for their company or campus. This provides a short path between their IPv6 network and any Teredo client. However, setting up a Teredo relay on a scale beyond that of a single network requires the ability to export BGP IPv6 routes to the other autonomous systems (AS&#x27;s).

Unlike 6to4, where the two halves of a connection can use different relays, traffic between a native IPv6 host and a Teredo client uses the same Teredo relay, namely the one closest to the native IPv6 host network-wise. The Teredo client cannot localize a relay by itself (since it cannot send IPv6 packets by itself). If it needs to initiate a connection to a native IPv6 host, it sends the first packet through the Teredo server, which sends a packet to the native IPv6 host using the client&#x27;s Teredo IPv6 address. The native IPv6 host then responds as usual to the client&#x27;s Teredo IPv6 address, which eventually causes the packet to find a Teredo relay, which initiates a connection to the client (possibly using the Teredo server for NAT piercing). The Teredo Client and native IPv6 host then use the relay for communication as long as they need to. This design means that neither the Teredo server nor client needs to know the IPv4 address of any Teredo relays. They find a suitable one automatically via the global IPv6 routing table, since all Teredo relays advertise the network 2001::/32.

On March 30, 2006, Italian ISP ITGate was the first AS to start advertising a route toward 2001::/32 on the IPv6 Internet, so that RFC 4380-compliant Teredo implementations would be fully usable. As of 16 February 2007, it is no longer functional.

In Q1 2009, IPv6 backbone Hurricane Electric enabled 14 Teredo relays in an anycast implementation and advertising 2001::/32 globally. The relays were located in Seattle, Fremont, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Toronto, New York, Ashburn, Miami, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Hong Kong.

It is expected that large network operators will maintain Teredo relays. As with 6to4, it remains unclear how well the Teredo service will scale up if a large proportion of Internet hosts start using IPv6 through Teredo in addition to IPv4. While Microsoft has operated a set of Teredo servers since they released the first Teredo pseudo-tunnel for Windows XP, they have never provided a Teredo relay service for the IPv6 Internet as a whole.

===Clients===
Officially, this mechanism was created for Microsoft Windows XP and onwards PCs to provide IPv6 connectivity to IPv4 clients by connecting to ipv6.microsoft.com and works in conjunction with IP Helper service and Teredo Tunneling Adapter Interface driver. The service also opens a UPNP port on the router for relaying.
== Limitations ==

Teredo is not compatible with all NAT devices. Using the terminology of RFC 3489, it supports full cone, restricted, and port-restricted NAT devices, but does not support symmetric NATs. The Shipworm specification original that led to the final Teredo protocol also supported symmetric NATs, but dropped that due to security concerns.

People at the National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan later proposed SymTeredo, which enhanced the original Teredo protocol to support symmetric NATs, and the Microsoft and Miredo implementations implement certain unspecified non-standard extensions to improve support for symmetric NATs. However, connectivity between a Teredo client behind a symmetric NAT, and a Teredo client behind a port-restricted or symmetric NAT remains seemingly impossible.

Indeed, Teredo assumes that when two clients exchange encapsulated IPv6 packets, the mapped/external UDP port numbers used will be the same as those that were used to contact the Teredo server (and building the Teredo IPv6 address). Without this assumption, it would not be possible to establish a direct communication between the two clients, and a costly relay would have to be used to perform triangle routing. A Teredo implementation tries to detect the type of NAT at startup, and will refuse to operate if the NAT appears to be symmetric. (This limitation can sometimes be worked around by manually configuring a port forwarding rule on the NAT box, which requires administrative access to the device).

Teredo can only provide a single IPv6 address per tunnel endpoint. As such, it is not possible to use a single Teredo tunnel to connect multiple hosts, unlike 6to4 and some point-to-point IPv6 tunnels. The bandwidth available to all Teredo clients toward the IPv6 Internet is limited by the availability of Teredo relays, which are no different than 6to4 relays in that respect.

== Alternatives ==
6to4 requires a public IPv4 address, but provides a large 48-bit IPv6 prefix for each tunnel endpoint, and has a lower encapsulation overhead. Point-to-point tunnels can be more reliable and are more accountable than Teredo, and typically provide permanent IPv6 addresses that do not depend on the IPv4 address of the tunnel endpoint. Some point-to-point tunnel brokers also support UDP encapsulation to traverse NATs (for instance, the AYIYA protocol can do this). On the other hand, point-to-point tunnels normally require registration. Automated tools (for instance AICCU) make it easy to use Point-to-Point tunnels.

== Security considerations ==

=== Exposure ===
Teredo increases the &quot;attack surface&quot; by assigning globally routable IPv6 addresses to network hosts behind NAT devices, which would otherwise be unreachable from the Internet. By doing so, Teredo potentially exposes any IPv6-enabled application with an open port to the outside. Teredo tunnel encapsulation can also cause the contents of the IPv6 data traffic to become invisible to packet inspection software, facilitating the spread of malware. Finally, Teredo exposes the IPv6 stack and the tunneling software to attacks should they have any remotely exploitable vulnerability.

In order to reduce the attack surface, the Microsoft IPv6 stack has a &quot;protection level&quot; socket option. This allows applications to specify from which sources they are willing to accept IPv6 traffic: from the Teredo tunnel, from anywhere except Teredo (the default), or only from the local intranet.

The Teredo protocol also encapsulates detailed information about the tunnel&#x27;s endpoint in its data packets. This information can help potential attackers by increasing the feasibility of an attack, and/or by reducing the effort required.

=== Firewalling, filtering, and blocking ===

For a Teredo pseudo-tunnel to operate properly, outgoing UDP packets to port 3544 must be unfiltered. Moreover, replies to these packets (i.e., &quot;solicited traffic&quot;) must also be unfiltered. This corresponds to the typical setup of a NAT and its stateful firewall functionality. Teredo tunneling software reports a fatal error and stops if outgoing IPv4 UDP traffic is blocked.

=== DoS via routing loops ===
In 2010, new methods to create denial of service attacks via routing loops that use Teredo tunnels were uncovered. They are relatively easy to prevent.

=== Default use in MS-Windows ===

Microsoft Windows as of Windows 10, version 1803 and later disable Teredo by default. If needed, this transitional technology can be enabled via a CLI command or Group Policy.

== Implementations ==
Several implementations of Teredo are currently available:

* Windows XP SP2 includes a client and &quot;host-specific&quot; relay (also in the Advanced Networking Pack for Service Pack 1).
* Windows Server 2003 has a relay and server provided under the Microsoft Beta program.
* Windows Vista and Windows 7 have built-in support for Teredo with an unspecified extension for symmetric NAT traversal. However, if only a link-local and Teredo address are present, these operating systems don&#x27;t try to resolve IPv6 DNS AAAA records if a DNS A record is present, in which case they use IPv4. Therefore, only literal IPv6 URLs typically use Teredo. This behavior can be modified in the registry.
* Windows 10 version 1803 and later disable Teredo by default. If needed, this transitional technology can be enabled via a CLI command or Group Policy.
* Miredo is a client, relay, and server for Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X,
* ng_teredo is a relay and server based on netgraph for FreeBSD from the LIP6 University and 6WIND.
* NICI-Teredo is a relay for the Linux kernel and a userland Teredo server, developed at the National Chiao Tung University.

== Choice of the name ==

The initial nickname of the Teredo tunneling protocol was &quot;Shipworm&quot;. The idea was that the protocol would pierce through NAT devices, much as the shipworm (a kind of marine wood-boring clam) bores tunnels through wood. Shipworms have been responsible for the loss of many wooden hulls. Christian Huitema, in the original draft, noted that the shipworm &quot;only survives in relatively clean and unpolluted water; its recent comeback in several Northern American harbors is a testimony to their newly retrieved cleanliness. The Shipworm service should, in turn, contributes to a newly retrieved transparency of the Internet.&quot;

To avoid confusion with computer worms, Huitema later changed the protocol&#x27;s name from &quot;Shipworm&quot; to &quot;Teredo&quot;, after the genus name of the shipworm &quot;Teredo navalis&quot;.

<text>Otto Nuschke (23 February 1883 – 27 December 1957) was a German politician. Nuschke was born in Frohburg in the Kingdom of Saxony. In 1910 he was elected secretary general of the liberal Progressive People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Fortschrittliche Volkspartei&quot;) of Kassel. In the same year he became chief editor of the Berliner Tageblatt and in 1915 co-editor of the &quot;Berliner Volkszeitung&quot;. Nuschke soon joined the Liberal Union (Freisinnige Vereinigung), left-wing liberal organisation, and became its secretary general of Kassel in 1906. As this group fused with other left-liberal organisations (in 1910) to form the Progressive People&#x27;s Party, Nuschke became the secretary general of the new party in Kassel.

In 1918, Nuschke took part in establishing the German Democratic Party. In 1919 he was a delegate to the National Congress of Weimar and from 1921 to 1933 he was a member of the Reichstag. In 1920s Nuschke was at times the deputy chairman of the German Democratic Party. Nuschke was one of the founders of the republican Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold and became the secretary general of the German State Party in 1931 (i.e., a successor to the German Democratic Party). After the Nazis gained power in 1933 Nuschke joined the opposition. After the 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life, he went into hiding.

After World War II, Nuschke became involved in the politics of the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ)--what became East Germany. Unlike most of the former German Democratic Party members, Nuschke did not take part in forming the LDPD/FDP, but became one of the co-founders of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in June 1945, along with Ferdinand Friedensburg, Ernst Lemmer and Walther Schreiber. In 1946 Nuschke was elected in the party&#x27;s executive committee. From 1946 to 1952 he was a member of the Landtag of Brandenburg. In 1947, after the deposition of party chairmen Jakob Kaiser and Ernst Lemmer by the Soviet military authorities, Nuschke became acting chairman and after the party congress of 1948, party chairman.

In March 1948, Nuschke—alongside Wilhelm Pieck (SED) and Wilhelm Külz (LDPD)—was chairman of the German People&#x27;s Council (&quot;Deutscher Volksrat&quot;) that drafted the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic. In 1949 Nuschke became a member of the Provisional People&#x27;s Chamber of the GDR. He remained a member of parliament until his death. After the formal establishment of the German Democratic Republic, Nuschke became Deputy Prime Minister and chief of the Church Office.

Nuschke was a loyal supporter of the SED regime, and gradually pushed out those CDU members not willing to do the Communists&#x27; bidding. This culminated in the party&#x27;s 1952 conference, at which the CDU formally declared itself a socialist party. On 17 June 1953, during the East German uprising, Nuschke and his driver were kidnapped and brought to West Berlin. Some American military recognised him and saved him from the angry masses. He and his driver were brought to a police station, but released on 19 June. After that Nuschke and his driver returned to East Berlin. In a spontaneous interview given to RIAS reporter Peter Schultze, Nuschke claimed that the East German government had popular support and that the demonstrators included West Berliners.

In 1954 he received the Patriotic Order of the GDR and in 1955 he received an honorary degree.

<doc id="1267387" wikidata="Q16207849" url="?curid=1267387" title="Brian Deer">
<text>Brian Deer is a British investigative journalist, best known for inquiries into the drug industry, medicine, and social issues for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Deer&#x27;s investigative nonfiction book &quot;The Doctor Who Fooled the World,&quot; an exposé on disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield and the 1998 Lancet MMR autism fraud, was published in September 2020 by Johns Hopkins University Press.

==Career ==
After graduating in philosophy from the University of Warwick, he became editor and press officer for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and was a member of &quot;The Leveller&quot; magazine collective. Subsequently, he joined &quot;The Times&quot;, then &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, first as a business news subeditor and then as a staff news reporter and feature writer. In the 1980s, under then &quot;Sunday Times&quot; editor Andrew Neil, Deer was the UK&#x27;s first social affairs correspondent.

Deer has also reported for other newspapers, including &quot;The Guardian&quot;, The Daily Telegraph, and The New York Times

=== Investigations ===
In 1986, one of Deer&#x27;s early investigations exposed research by British scientist Michael Briggs at Deakin University, Australia into the safety of the contraceptive pill. Deer&#x27;s reports revealed that several of Briggs&#x27;s studies were fabricated so as to give a positive profile for the products&#x27; cardiovascular safety. The research was largely financed by the German drug company Schering AG.

In 1994, his investigation of the Wellcome Trust led to the withdrawal in the UK of the antibiotic, Septrin (also sold under the name Bactrim) and the sale by the Wellcome Trust of its drug company subsidiary. In 2005, the withdrawal of the painkiller Vioxx was followed by an investigation by Deer into the people responsible for the drug&#x27;s introduction.

In 2006, Deer&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot; documentary, &quot;The drug trial that went wrong&quot;, investigated the experimental monoclonal antibody TGN1412. It was nominated for a Royal Television Society journalism award. In 2008, the media psychiatrist Raj Persaud was suspended from practicing medicine and resigned his academic position after being found guilty of plagiarism following an investigation by Deer.

== MMR vaccine controversy ==

In a series of reports between 2004 and 2010, for &quot;The Sunday Times,&quot; Deer investigated and helped debunk controversial claims linking the MMR vaccine to autism that had first emerged with the publication in 1998 of a fraudulent research paper in the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; written by Andrew Wakefield, and his colleagues. Deer revealed that Wakefield had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest, had manipulated evidence, and was responsible for what the &quot;BMJ&quot; later called &quot;an elaborate fraud&quot;.

Deer&#x27;s investigation led to the longest-ever inquiry by the UK General Medical Council (GMC), lasting 217 days. In January 2010, the GMC judged Wakefield to be &quot;dishonest&quot;, &quot;unethical&quot; and &quot;callous&quot;, and on 24 May 2010, Wakefield was removed (&quot;struck off&quot;) from the UK medical register. Responding to Deer&#x27;s findings, &quot;The Lancet&quot; partially retracted Wakefield&#x27;s research in February 2004, and fully retracted it in February 2010 following the GMC findings. In January 2011, Deer published his findings in the &quot;BMJ&quot; which in a signed editorial stated of the journalist, &quot;It has taken the diligent scepticism of one man, standing outside medicine and science, to show that the paper was in fact an elaborate fraud.&quot;

On 18 November 2004, UK Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot; series broadcast Deer&#x27;s television documentary: &quot;MMR: What they didn&#x27;t tell you&quot;. Television critic Nancy Banks-Smith wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;After a year of rebuffs, Deer ran Dr Wakefield to ground at an Indianapolis conference on autism. The camera took a bit of a buffet and Dr Wakefield left with Deer following, shouting: &#x27;We have very important questions to ask you about your research and your commercial ambitions, sir! Will you stand your ground and answer?&#x27; If this was hounding, and it was, Dr Wakefield had only himself to blame for running away&quot;. In response to the documentary, Wakefield initiated a libel suit against Deer. The case was later dropped and Wakefield became liable for the costs incurred by Deer and the other defendants.

In January 2012, Wakefield sued Deer and the &quot;BMJ&quot;, this time in Texas, but the case was thrown out in both district and appeals courts, with Wakefield again ordered to pay costs.

In October 2014, in an article published in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Deer reported on a ruling from the Court of Protection, then recently made public but with the identities of the parties redacted. In the ruling, Justice Baker wrote, &quot;The critical facts established in this case can be summarised as follows. M has autistic disorder. There is no evidence that his autism was caused by the MMR vaccination. His parents&#x27; account of an adverse reaction to that vaccination is fabricated.&quot;

In July 2015, Deer gave a lecture at The Amazing Meeting titled &quot;Vaccines: The Vanishing Victims&quot;.

=== &quot;The Doctor Who Fooled the World&quot; ===
In September 2020 Johns Hopkins University Press published in North America Deer&#x27;s investigation of Andrew Wakefield and the origins of the anti-vaccine movement in his book, &quot;The Doctor Who Fooled the World: Science, Deception, and the War on Vaccines&quot;. This was simultaneously published in the United Kingdom and Australasia by Scribe. Reviews included &quot;The Times&quot; Book of the Week where columnist David Aaronovitch wrote, &quot;This is a remarkable story and this is a remarkable book… helping to explain the political and social predicament that now afflicts so many of us — the crisis in truth and its exploitation by people without scruple.&quot; Reviewing for the leading science journal &quot;Nature&quot;, Saad Omer praised the book as &quot;riveting… a compelling portrait of hubris and the terrible dark shadow it can cast.&quot;

Among other reviews, Michael Shermer in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Exposing researchers who lie, cheat and fake their data often requires the work of courageous whistleblowers or tenacious investigative journalists. Enter Brian Deer, an award-winning reporter for The Sunday Times of London.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; also described the book as &quot;riveting&quot;, and the Big Think website said, &quot;Every chapter drops your jaw&quot;. According to &quot;Foreword Reviews&quot;, &quot;This stunning work sounds an urgent message and demonstrates the essential role of investigative journalism in uncovering the truth.&quot;

== Honours ==
Working for &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Deer received several awards, including two British Press Awards for his &quot;Sunday Times&quot; investigations. Following his first British Press Award in 1999, in February 2011 he was nominated for two more, in the categories of news reporter of the year and specialist journalist of the year, the latter of which he won on 5 April 2011.

In October 2011, Deer won the annual HealthWatch award, previously awarded to Sir Iain Chalmers, Professor David Colquhoun, and other prominent British medical campaigners. Deer was the 2009 Susan B. Meister lecturer in child health policy at the University of Michigan, and the 2012 Distinguished Lecturer in Life Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse.

On 17 November 2016, Deer was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (D Litt Hon) by York St John University.

In May 2021, Deer&#x27;s book, &quot;The Doctor Who Fooled the World&quot;, won the Eric Hoffer Award for nonfiction, and a gold medal in the Independent Publisher Book Awards (IPPYs).

<doc id="1267388" wikidata="Q475073" url="?curid=1267388" title="Aranyaprathet district">
<text>Aranyaprathet (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) in Sa Kaeo province in Thailand. It borders Cambodia to the east and the busiest border crossing between Cambodia and Thailand is located in this district.

The largest town in the district is also called Aranyaprathet.

==History==
Aranyaprathet was originally a district in the Kabin Buri Province. On 1 April 1926 the province was abolished and the two districts Mueang Kabin Buri and Aranyapathet became districts of Prachinburi province. In 1993 it was one of the districts that formed the new Sa Kaeo province.

==Economy==
Until the Khmer Rouge disrupted neighbouring Cambodia in 1975, Aranyaprathet was a stop on the railroad connecting Bangkok with the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. Aranyaprathet maintains its rail link with Bangkok but Poipet, the neighbouring Cambodian town, has still yet to see any rail activity since the Khmer Rouge destroyed the track.

Six kilometres southeast of Aranyaprathet town, at Ban Klong Luk (also spelled Ban Khlong Luek), is the busiest border crossing between Cambodia and Thailand. In addition to being on a major trade route, the border sees much tourist activity as it is on the road between Bangkok and Siem Reap, the town nearest Angkor Wat.

Aran, as the town is known in Thailand, has been affected by the growth of the gambling industry in Poipet. Despite gambling being illegal in both Thailand and Cambodia, the Cambodian government has granted concessions for casinos to be built at many of its land crossings. Cambodians are not permitted to gamble in the casinos. Poipet&#x27;s proximity to Bangkok (3-5 hrs by road) has made it the most popular of these border casino areas. It now hosts seven casinos.

== Administration ==
Aranyaprathet is divided into 13 sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 114 administrative villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

==Stadium==
Aranyaprathet District Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium used mostly for football matches and was the home stadium of Sa Kaeo F.C.

<text>Franz Roubaud (; ; 15 June 1856 – 13 March 1928) was a Russian painter of French origin who created some of the largest and best known panoramic paintings. He created circular paintings, exposed on a cylindrical surface and viewed from the inside at a lookout point. His paintings were often believed to reproduce the original scene with high fidelity.

== Biography ==

Franz (François) Roubaud was born on 15 June 1856 in Odessa to Honoré Fortuné Alexis Roubaud and his wife Magdeleine (née Sénèque). Franz was the fourth of five children in a Catholic family; his father was a bookseller and stationer, originally from Marseille. He studied at the Odessa Drawing School. In 1877 Roubaud went to Munich and studied at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts.

He then settled in Saint Petersburg, working in the Imperial Academy of Arts and painting huge panoramas of historical battles. In 1904-12 Roubaud taught at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts as a professor. During this time he painted the Siege of Sevastopol, a panoramic painting. In the mid-19th century, the various panoramic paintings became a fashionable way to depict landscapes and historical events. The &quot;panorama&quot; was a 360-degree visual medium patented by the artist Robert Barker in 1787. This was a new thing for the time and for the audiences in Europe of this period these paintings were a sensation. The paintings created a new illusion, transporting the viewer into a virtual reality, creating the perception of being physically present in the middle of the events. When standing in the middle of the 360 degree panorama this created the impression of standing in a new environment.

He became renowned thanks to the giant panoramic paintings he executed during his lifetime. Roubaud&#x27;s works were so large that they required specially built pavilions to exhibit them. These paintings are one of the few panoramas still extant of a popular 19th-century genre. The viewer stands in the centre of the circular panorama, and observes the various scenes whilst walking around and observing the panorama from different viewing angles.

In 1913 Roubaud left Russia for Germany, settling in Munich. After the outbreak of World War I, the German authorities recognized him as a French citizen, but did not intern him, and on 19 December 1914 they granted him German citizenship. He lived in Munich for the rest of his life and died on 13 March 1928.

=== Sevastopol Panorama===
The &quot;Sevastopol Panorama&quot; is a giant painting depicting the siege of Sevastopol of 1854–55. The painting was exhibited in a rotunda, a special building constructed in a circular shape. The size of the painting is enormous, but it was a necessity for the realistic depiction of military scenes because of the huge number of participants and the wide sweep of the scenery. Roubaud worked on this painting for almost three years, starting in 1901. He researched the historical events by traveling to Sevastopol, reading about the battle itself as well as by reading historical documents that described the different scenes and incidents during the war. He also talked to surviving participants. Roubaud made his first sketches in Saint Petersburg. He kept working on the painting later at the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts where he decided to use a canvas 14 m high by 115 m long. When he finished the painting, it was displayed in Sevastopol in the summer of 1904, on the fiftieth anniversary of the defence of the city.

<text>The University of Salzburg (), also known as the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg (&quot;Paris-Lodron-Universität Salzburg&quot;, PLUS), is an Austrian public university in Salzburg municipality, Salzburg State, named after its founder, Prince-Archbishop Paris Lodron.

Established in 1622, the university was closed in 1810 and re-established in 1962. Nowadays, it has around 18,000 students and 2,800 employees; it is the largest educational institution in Salzburg State. It is divided into six faculties: Catholic Theology, Law and Economics, Cultural Sciences, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Analytical and Life Sciences.

== Benedictine University ==
On 23 July 1622, Archbishop Paris Lodron appointed the scholar Albert Keuslin first rector of the Benedictine university. Keuslin, a graduate of the Jesuit University of Dillingen, had established the &quot;Akademisches Gymnasium&quot;, a secondary school, at Salzburg five years earlier. By resolution of Emperor Ferdinand II, issued on October 8, the Gymnasium was raised to a university. While the Thirty Years&#x27; War raged outside the Archbishopric of Salzburg, the university was built up and maintained by a federation of Benedictine abbeys from Salzburg, Switzerland, Bavaria and Austria. In its early years, courses taught were theology, divinity, philosophy, law, and medicine.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Prince-Archbishopric was secularized as the Electorate of Salzburg in 1803. It was ruled by Archduke Ferdinand III of Austria, a brother of Emperor Francis I, who established a Faculty of Medicine. After Salzburg was annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810, however, the university was closed on 24 December and replaced by a &quot;Lyzeum&quot; college with sections for divinity and philosophy, as well as a school for medicine and surgery. After the Napoleonic Wars, Salzburg became part of the Austrian Empire.

The divinity section was again converted to a faculty in 1850. In World War I, plans were evolved to relocate the Francis Joseph University from Czernowitz to Salzburg, though never carried out.

== University of Salzburg ==

The University of Salzburg was not re-established until 1962, with a faculty of Catholic theology and a faculty of philosophy. Classes resumed in 1964, with a faculty of law added the following year. In 1975, a new federal law regulated the organisation of all Austrian universities. The University of Salzburg created four academic divisions: the Faculty of Catholic Theology, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Humanities, and the Faculty of Natural Sciences. A fifth division, the Faculty of Medicine, was not realized.

In 1995, the organisation of Austrian universities was further restructured with more faculty autonomy. The university gradually incorporated new academic programs through 2004 into 32 &quot;Fachbereiche&quot; or “departments”, and again, decided not to create a Faculty of Medicine.

==Locations==
The University of Salzburg has no central campus, occupying several buildings in Salzburg&#x27;s historic centre: parts of the Salzburg Residenz building (&quot;Toskanatrakt&quot;) and on Kapitelgasse south of Salzburg Cathedral. The university library is located between the Kollegienkirche (the University Church) and the Großes Festspielhaus; attached to it is the &quot;Große Aula&quot;, or ceremonial hall.

The traditional faculty building of Humanities (Communication Studies, Sociology and Political Science) is located by the Rudolfskai. The Faculty of Sciences is located just further south.

Completed in 2011, the &quot;Unipark Nonntal&quot; campus (replacing the old location at the Akademiestraße) is home to the departments of modern languages, and cultural and social sciences. The building is 17,000 square metres in size, with 5,500 students and 300 academic staff. There is a library and an &quot;Auditorium Maximum&quot;. Financing for the construction of the Unipark Nonntal was enabled by successful negotiations between Salzburg’s state governor Franz Schausberger and the Federal Ministry of Education. Originally designed in 2002 by architects Storch Ehlers Partners, it was constructed in three years.

Smaller university offices and institutes are scattered throughout the city, with arts and music being taught at the Mozarteum University Salzburg.

<text>John Alexander Davis (born October 26, 1961) is an American film director, writer, animator, voice actor and composer known for his work both in stop-motion animation as well as computer animation, live action and live-action/CGI hybrids. Davis is best known for creating Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; franchise, which enjoyed popularity in the early to mid 2000s.

==Early life==
Davis began animating as a child using his parents&#x27; 8 mm camera to film action figures in stop motion. His interest in animation began when he watched a stop motion film called &quot;Icharus&quot; at a film festival. He worked on the stop motion film &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot; in 1981 while still attending Southern Methodist University, where he graduated in 1984.

==Career==
Soon after his graduation Davis joined the animation company K&amp;H Productions, working with 2-D animator Keith Alcorn. Soon, Davis made the transition from claymation to 2-D animation with Alcorn&#x27;s help. K&amp;H did production work for commercials, public-access television cable TV animation, and film festivals. K&amp;H Productions declared bankruptcy in early 1987; that same year DNA Productions was founded.

Davis came up with the idea for &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; (originally named Johnny Quasar) sometime during the 1980s and wrote a script titled &quot;Runaway Rocketboy&quot; (later the name of the second pilot) which was later abandoned. While moving to a new house in the early 1990s, he stumbled upon the script and re-worked it as a short film titled &quot;Johnny Quasar&quot; and presented it in SIGGRAPH where he met Steve Oedekerk and worked on a television series as well as the film.

In 2006, he directed the film &quot;The Ant Bully&quot; after being approached by Tom Hanks to direct the film. Production on the film made Davis resign from production of &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; in January 2003. He gave his position away as executive in charge of production to Steve Oedekerk. He also directed the film&#x27;s video game.

Davis was set to direct an upcoming feature film based on &quot;Neopets&quot; with Warner Bros., together with producer Dylan Sellers and writer Rob Lieber. It was originally set to release on April 20, 2009, but was changed to 2011 and later changed to winter of 2012, before finally being cancelled with no other projects announced.

==Nominations==
In 2000, Davis was up for an Emmy along with 8 others in the category Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming More Than One Hour) for &quot;Olive, the Other Reindeer&quot;, but lost to Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;.

In 2002, Davis was nominated for an Academy Award along with Steve Oedekerk in the category of Best Animated Feature for &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;.

==Filmography==
===Internet===
==Astrophotography==
Since about 2007, Davis has become a recognized astrophotographer, publishing high-resolution, generally wide-field images in astronomy magazines, and in NASA&#x27;s Astronomy Picture of the Day.

In 2009, Davis largely founded and continues to lead APSIG, the Astrophotography Special Interest Group, associated with the Texas Astronomical Society of Dallas.

<text>The ClueFinders Math Adventures Ages 9–12: Mystery in the Himalayas is a computer game in The Learning Company&#x27;s &quot;ClueFinders&quot; series, where the ClueFinders try to recover stolen treasures in a small Himalayan village.

==Plot==
In a village high in the Himalayas, twenty-four priceless treasures have been stolen. An elder of the village calls the ClueFinders to help uncover the treasures and the thief&#x27;s identity. Many, including the elder&#x27;s pessimistic apprentice, believe the Yeti is behind the theft, but the clues all point in different directions and it appears a different person is responsible for the theft of each item.

==Gameplay==
The game is set up similar to Clue in that the central goal of each round is to identify three variables - who stole the treasure, which treasure they stole and where they hid it - based on clues. Clues are acquired from playing games and helping the villagers with their work. Once the user has enough clues he/she can limit down the number of possibilities until only one remains. When twenty-four treasures are restored, the game is won.

The game has nine different activities, purely focused on the subject of Mathematics including Arithmetic, Decimals, Fractions, Geometrics, Graphs and Logic.

==Reception==

A review by gracepub for ReviewStream.com was generally positive. The review noted that the game was developed cleverly, and stated that the children can solve the math concepts without the parent&#x27;s help when playing the game. The game was given a rating of 9 out of 10.

<text>Fausto de Elhuyar (11 October 1755 – 6 February 1833) was a Spanish chemist, and the first to isolate tungsten with his brother Juan José Elhuyar in 1783. He was in charge, under a King of Spain commission, of organizing the School of Mines in México City and so was responsible for building the Palacio de Minería, a structure that would house the school. Elhuyar left Mexico after the Mexican War of Independence, when most of the Spanish residents in Mexico were expelled.

==Life==
He was born in Logroño, La Rioja, Spain son of Basque-French parents from Hasparren, France.

Between 1773 and 1777, Elhúyar studied medicine, surgery and chemistry, as well as mathematics, physics and natural history with his brother Juan José Elhuyar in Paris. After graduating, he returned to Spain, where he exercised himself in the study of mineralogy, specially that of the Basque Country and Navarre, where he resided. In 1781, he was appointed a member of the &quot;Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País&quot; (&quot;Royal Basque Society of Friends to the Country&quot;), an enlightened institution thanks to which he started teaching as professor of mineralogy and metallurgy in Bergara, the seat of both the &quot;Vascongada Society&quot; and the University of Vergara (nowadays merged with the University of the Basque Country). During those years, he published numerous articles and dossiers about minerals, ways to extract and purify them, etc., which made him famous throughout Europe as one of the top experts on the subject. In 1780, he started working in the &quot;Laboratorium Chemicum&quot; of Vergara along with François Chavaneau, with whom he was the first to purify platinum. After several months, he was the first person to discover and isolate tungsten, of which he&#x27;s credited, along with his brother Juan José, as its discoverer. He also collaborated with Joseph-Louis Proust, the famous French chemist at the service of king Charles IV of Spain, who directed the &quot;National Laboratory&quot; in Segovia.

In 1783, he visited several European universities, such as the School of Mines of Freiberg, at which he lectured on metallurgy and mine machinery; the University of Uppsala, where he collaborated with Torbern Olof Bergman; and Köping, where he visited Carl Wilhelm Scheele, the one who announced Elhúyar&#x27;s discovery of tungsten, and for some reason is credited for having made the discovery himself.

After his return to Spain, in 1785 he renounced his professorship and, in July 1786, was appointed General Director of Mines in Mexico. Before departing to his new office, he toured Europe again from 1786 to 1788 in order to study &quot;Born&#x27;s method&quot; on refining silver. During this trip, he married Joan Raab in Vienna, in 1787. For the next thirty three years, he resided in Mexico City, where the crown founded the capital&#x27;s School of Mines (January 1, 1792), with Elhuyar as its first director. During his tenure, he commissioned and directed the construction of that institution&#x27;s seat, the &quot;Palacio de Minería&quot;, which was finished in 1813 and is considered one of the jewels of the Spanish American neoclassicism. He also visited and improved several of the existing Royal Mines of Mexico, dramatically increasing their productivity due to the introduction of new methods of exploitation. He aided Alexander von Humboldt during his time in New Spain, along with other mining experts then in Mexico, allowing Humboldt&#x27;s section on mining in his &quot;Political essay on the Kingdom of New Spain&quot; to be replete with statistics and insights.

After Mexican Independence, he returned to Spain, where, due to his wide experience in modern minery methods, he was appointed Minister of Minery in 1822, and supervised the modern mining of the mines in Almadén, Guadalcanal, and Río Tinto. After falling from his ministry, he was appointed yet again General Director of Mines, and resumed his research activities in chemistry from this quieter office till his death in Madrid on January 6, 1833.

<doc id="1267423" wikidata="Q5165737" url="?curid=1267423" title="Contrarian investing">
<text>Contrarian investing is an investment strategy that is characterized by purchasing and selling in contrast to the prevailing sentiment of the time.

A contrarian believes that certain crowd behavior among investors can lead to exploitable mispricings in securities markets. For example, widespread pessimism about a stock can drive a price so low that it overstates the company&#x27;s risks, and understates its prospects for returning to profitability. Identifying and purchasing such distressed stocks, and selling them after the company recovers, can lead to above-average gains. Conversely, widespread optimism can result in unjustifiably high valuations that will eventually lead to drops, when those high expectations do not pan out. Avoiding investments in over-hyped investments reduces the risk of such drops. These general principles can apply whether the investment in question is an individual stock, an industry sector, or an entire market or any other asset class.

Some contrarians have a permanent bear market view, while the majority of investors bet on the market going up. However, a contrarian does not necessarily have a negative view of the overall stock market, nor do they have to believe that it is always overvalued, or that the conventional wisdom is always wrong. Rather, a contrarian seeks opportunities to buy or sell specific investments when the majority of investors appear to be doing the opposite, to the point where that investment has become mispriced. While more &quot;buy&quot; candidates are likely to be identified during market declines (and vice versa), these opportunities can occur during periods when the overall market is generally rising or falling.

==Similarity to value investing==
Contrarian investing is related to value investing in that the contrarian is also looking for mispriced investments and buying those that appear to be undervalued by the market. In &quot;The Art of Contrary Thinking&quot; (1954) by Humphrey B. Neill; considered influential by some in contrarian thinking, he notes it is easy to find something to go contrary to, but difficult to discover when everybody believes it. He concludes &quot;when everybody thinks alike, everybody is likely to be wrong.&quot; Some well-known value investors such as John Neff have questioned whether there is a such thing as a &quot;contrarian&quot;, seeing it as essentially synonymous with value investing. One possible distinction is that a value stock, in finance theory, can be identified by financial metrics such as the book value or P/E ratio. A contrarian investor may look at those metrics, but is also interested in measures of &quot;sentiment&quot; regarding the stock among other investors, such as sell-side analyst coverage and earnings forecasts, trading volume, and media commentary about the company and its business prospects.

In the example of a stock that has dropped because of excessive pessimism, one can see similarities to the &quot;margin of safety&quot; that value investor Benjamin Graham sought when purchasing stocks—essentially, being able to buy shares at a discount to their intrinsic value with an additional margin to adjust for possible errors in one&#x27;s calculations. Arguably, that margin of safety is more likely to exist when a stock has fallen a great deal, and that type of drop is usually accompanied by negative news and general pessimism.

==Notable contrarian investors==
*Bill Ackman is a contrarian investor who twice reinvested heavily in beaten-down Valeant Pharmaceuticals against prevailing market sentiments. Later, he short-sold Herbalife, but was forced to take a large loss after the stock failed to fall as predicted.
*Warren Buffett is a famous contrarian, who believes the best time to invest in a stock is when shortsightedness of the market has beaten down the price.
*Dodge &amp; Cox is an American investing firm whose approach has been characterized as contrarian.

*Jim Rogers is an investor and author who is bullish on contrarian investing in Asian markets.
*Marc Faber is a contrarian investor who publishes the &quot;Gloom Boom &amp; Doom Report&quot;.
*David Dreman is a money manager often associated with contrarian investing. He has authored several books on the topic and writes the &quot;Contrarian&quot; column in &quot;Forbes magazine&quot;. 
*John Maynard Keynes was an early contrarian investor. 
*John Neff, who managed the Vanguard Windsor fund for many years, is also considered a contrarian, though he has described himself as a value investor (and questioned the distinction).
*Mark Ripple is a money manager often described as a contrarian. He has authored a book covering the topic in detail.

*Allan Gray was a noted South African contrarian investor that believed the best value was typically to be had when the market was down.
*George Soros is often described as a visionary contrarian investor by analysts who cite his famous shorting of the yen and pound, an act that netted him $2 billion in profits.

==Examples==
Economist John Maynard Keynes was an early contrarian investor when he managed the endowment for King&#x27;s College, Cambridge from the 1920s to &#x27;40s. While most university endowments of the time invested almost exclusively in land and fixed income assets, Keynes was perhaps the first institutional investor to invest heavily in common stocks and international stocks. On average, Keynes&#x27;s investments out-performed the U.K. market by more than 6% with a strategy similar to, but developed independently of, the value investing paradigm of Benjamin Graham and Charles Dodd.

Commonly used contrarian indicators for investor sentiment are Volatility Indexes (informally also referred to as &quot;Fear indexes&quot;), like VIX, which by tracking the prices of financial options, gives a numeric measure of how pessimistic or optimistic market actors at large are. A low number in this index indicates a prevailing optimistic or confident investor outlook for the future, while a high number indicates a pessimistic outlook. By comparing the VIX to the major stock-indexes over longer periods of time, it is evident that peaks in this index generally present good buying opportunities.

Another example of a simple contrarian strategy is Dogs of the Dow. When purchasing the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that have the highest relative dividend yield, an investor is often buying many of the &quot;distressed&quot; companies among those 30 stocks. These &quot;Dogs&quot; have high yields not because dividends were raised, but rather because their share prices fell. The company is experiencing difficulties, or simply is at a low point in their business cycle. By repeatedly buying such stocks, and selling them when they no longer meet the criteria, the &quot;Dogs&quot; investor is systematically buying the least-loved of the Dow 30, and selling them when they become loved again eventually.

When the Dot com bubble started to deflate, an investor would have profited by avoiding the technology stocks that were the subject of most investors&#x27; attention. Asset classes such as value stocks and real estate investment trusts were largely ignored by the financial press at the time, despite their historically low valuations, and many mutual funds in those categories lost assets. These investments experienced strong gains amidst the large drops in the overall US stock market when the bubble unwound.

The Fidelity Contrafund was founded in 1967 &quot;to take a contrarian view, investing in out-of-favor stocks or sectors&quot;, but over time has abandoned this strategy to become a large cap growth fund.

==Relationship to behavioral finance==
Contrarians are attempting to exploit some of the principles of behavioral finance, and there is significant overlap between these fields. For example, studies in behavioral finance have demonstrated that investors as a group tend to overweight recent trends when predicting the future; a poorly performing stock will remain bad, and a strong performer will remain strong. This lends credence to the contrarian&#x27;s belief that investments may drop &quot;too low&quot; during periods of negative news, due to incorrect assumptions by other investors, regarding the long-term prospects for the company. Furthermore, Foye and Mramor (2016) find that country-specific factors have a strong influence on measures of value (such as the book-to-market ratio). This leads them to conclude that the reasons why value stocks outperform are both country-specific and behavioral.

<doc id="1267427" wikidata="Q693956" url="?curid=1267427" title="Hamburg S-Bahn">
<text>The Hamburg S-Bahn is a rapid transit railway system in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Together, the S-Bahn, the Hamburg U-Bahn, the AKN railway and the regional railway form the backbone of railway public transport in the city and the surrounding area. The network has operated since 1907 as a commuter rail system, under the direction of the state railway, and is a member of the Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (HVV; Hamburg Transport Association). There are four lines, serving 68 stations, on of route. On an average working day the S-Bahn transports about 590,000 passengers; in 2010 about 221 million people used the S-Bahn.

The S-Bahn is the only railway in Germany that uses both 1,200 V DC supplied by a third rail and supplied by overhead lines. Most of the tracks are separated from other rail services. The S-Bahn is operated by S-Bahn Hamburg GmbH, a subsidiary of DB Regio.

Similarly to Berlin but unlike Hanover, the S-Bahn is an important part of public transport within the city due to its dense schedule and good coverage of the metropolitan region. Unlike both Berlin and Hanover, the S-Bahn is of little importance for regional traffic since the network lies mostly within the city, though in 2007 the southwestern S3 line was extended about into the state of Lower Saxony (the &quot;Neugraben - Stade&quot; portion, which included seven new stations).
== History ==
=== 1906: Opening ===
On 5 December 1906, under the description , the Prussian &quot;Eisenbahndirektion&quot; (railway division) of Altona opened with steam trains between Blankenese, Altona (Elbe) and Hamburg.

The Stadt- und Vorortbahn (City and Suburban railway) included the Altona-Blankenese line (&quot;Altona-Blankeneser Bahn&quot;, opened in 1867), the local tracks of the Hamburg-Altona link line (&quot;Verbindungsbahn&quot;, opened in 1866) and a new section to Ohlsdorf.

The &quot;Verbindungsbahn&quot; had been extended from one track to four and level crossings eliminated between 1893 and 1903. The new double-track line adjoining it was completed in the summer of 1906 after an eight-year construction period. It ran alongside the Lübeck–Hamburg line of the Lübeck-Büchen Railway Company as far as Hasselbrook and then on its own tracks as far as the new Ohlsdorf cemetery. A new main cemetery with good transit connections was necessary in part due to the extension of the central railway lines, which had reduced the area of the existing already strained cemeteries near the city&#x27;s medieval fortifications.

=== 1907/08: First electric operation ===

The line was electrified with overhead lines supplying 6,600 V alternating current at 25 Hz. The electricity came from a coal-fired power station in &quot;Leverkusenstraße&quot; in Bahrenfeld, which also provided power to the Altona harbour railway.

The first electric trains ran on 1 October 1907, and from 29 January 1908 the line from Blankenese to Ohlsdorf was served exclusively by electric trains. These dates are considered the birthdates of the S-Bahn.

The basic unit of an AC train consisted of two articulated compartment carriages on six axles with motorised two-axle bogies under each cab end and a Jacobs bogie in the middle. The carriages, with doors on each side of the compartments, took their design and functionality from Prussian compartment carriages.

=== 1924: Network expansion along the Alster valley railway ===

A railway line constructed and operated by a local company in 1914 and taken over by the district of Stormarn after bankruptcy, led from Ohlsdorf to Poppenbüttel in Prussia, with the goal of connecting neighbouring settlements along the Alster river. It was known as the Alster Valley Railway. It opened in 1918 with petrol-powered trains. The district of Stormarn gave the line to the German Imperial railway company, which electrified it and provided the extension of the Hamburg-Altona City and Suburban railway to Poppenbüttel in 1924.

=== 1934: Designation as an S-Bahn ===

The term S-Bahn was first coined and used in Berlin from 1930, where a similar system on the &quot;City, Ring and Suburban lines&quot; had been operated since 1924; it was first used by the German Imperial railway with reference to its &quot;Hamburg-Altona City and Suburban railway&quot; in 1934. The term was also used to describe non-electric services on lines within the local suburban tariff: the steam-powered lines from Blankenese to Wedel, from Altona to Elmshorn, from Hamburg to Friedrichsruh and to Harburg. Since 2002, lines not served by S-Bahn have been designated &quot;Regional railway lines&quot;.

=== 1939/40: Moving to the DC system ===

In the 1930s, after almost 30 years of service, the necessity to renew the trains and infrastructure had become apparent. Since the DC system had proved itself over more than a decade with the Berlin S-Bahn, where the 750 volt DC power was supplied by a third rail, the German Imperial Railway decided to adopt the same system for Hamburg in 1937 and to abandon overhead AC. In order to allow improved acceleration, the S-Bahn uses 1200 volts: as a consequence, Berlin and Hamburg rolling stock are not compatible with each other. The first DC trains, of the type ET 171, were delivered in 1939; daily service began in July 1940 alongside the AC trains. Due to the Second World War and the post-war years with their shortages, mixed usage lasted until 1955.

The basic DC train unit consisted of three four-axle carriages, each with four sliding double doors per side. The middle carriages had upholstered seats for second class, while the motorised end carriages had third-class wooden seats.

=== Network extensions from 1950 to 1965 ===

The DC S-Bahn was extended along the single-track suburban line from Blankenese to Sülldorf in 1950 and to Wedel in 1954. A section of the mainline railway between Hamburg and Berlin, which, due to the division of Germany, had very little traffic, between Haupbahnhof and Bergedorf was added to the network in 1959 by the addition of the third rail. This was the first section where S-Bahn and mainline trains (the number of the latter remained small until 1990) shared tracks. It was the second S-Bahn line, from Bergedorf via &quot;Berliner Tor&quot; to &quot;Altona&quot;. 
In 1962 a connecting curve was constructed from the Verbindungsbahn at &quot;Holstenstraße&quot; to the Altona-Kaltenkirchen railway, whose terminus was relocated to &quot;Langenfelde&quot;. The S-Bahn was extended in 1965 along the AKN to Eidelstedt and from there along the mainline tracks towards Kiel as far as &quot;Elbgaustraße&quot;.

=== HVV and a line numbering system ===

In 1965, the German Railway, along with two local transport companies, founded the Hamburger Verkehrsverbund, a common tariff system for U-Bahn and bus lines. The S-Bahn joined in December 1966. From January 1967, the S-Bahn lines were designated &quot;S1&quot;−&quot;S6&quot; (see &quot;Network&quot;). Line designations with a leading letter &quot;S&quot; have since been adopted for other S-Bahn systems in the German-speaking world. Analogically, U-Bahn lines got the leading letter &quot;U&quot;.

=== Network extension after 1967 ===
Extensions were made in 1967 on separate tracks from Elbgaustraße to Pinneberg, and in 1969 on existing mainline tracks from Bergedorf to Aumühle.

To ease the strain on the central Verbindungsbahn (&quot;connection railway&quot;), a second main connection was constructed, the City S-Bahn, which traverses the city centre in a tunnel. The first section was opened in 1975 between Hauptbahnhof and Landungsbrücken, the extension to Altona in 1979 and was completed in 1981 with the connection above ground to &quot;Diebsteich&quot;. 1983 saw the opening of the line via Wilhelmsburg to &quot;Harburg Rathaus&quot;, a long stretch of which runs along the existing mainline. Through Hammerbrook the trains run on a concrete viaduct and in a tunnel under the centre of Harburg. The line was extended in 1984 along the Niederelbebahn to Neugraben.

The line to Bergedorf was placed on separate tracks due to increased traffic on the main line during the 1990s as a result of German reunification. For the same reason, S-Bahn service between Bergedorf and Aumühle was suspended in 1994. The section to Reinbek was reopened in 1997; completion to Aumühle was delayed until 2002 due to court challenges from local residents. In 1999, Allermöhe station (between Mittlerer Landweg and Nettelnburg) opened in the new housing development of Neuallermöhe-West.

Since December 2007, the S3 has served stations between Neugraben and Stade.

The groundbreaking for a long line from Ohlsdorf to the airport took place in 1991, and again in 2001; the line was opened on 11 December 2008 and has been fully operational since 12 December 2008. Northbound S1 trains split at Ohlsdorf, the front section to the airport, the rear section continues to Poppenbüttel. 
== Operating company ==
The S-Bahn is operated by &quot;S-Bahn Hamburg GmbH&quot;, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG. The company is answerable to DB Regio Nord and was formed in 1997.

The S-Bahn is represented in German cities with a logo consisting of a white &quot;S&quot; in a green circle. In Hamburg the same logo with a red background was used for a few years before November 2007.

The company currently employs approximately 1200 personnel in the driving, maintenance, train departure and resource management divisions. Another 300 employees are responsible for security and cleaning, through subsidiaries.

== Lines ==

The network covers about , and serves 68 stations. It consists of two trunk routes crossing the city in an east-west direction – the northern &quot;Hamburg-Altona link line&quot; and the southern &quot;City S-Bahn&quot; – and six connecting routes (two in the western part of the city and four in the eastern part). The trunk routes connect at Altona and Hauptbahnhof. are separated from other rail services, are shared with regional and cargo traffic. About is in tunnel, are single track.

There are four main lines (S1, S2, S3, S5) Lines S1 and S3 use the &quot;City-S-Bahn&quot; via &quot;Jungfernstieg&quot;, S2 and S5 use the &quot;Verbindungsbahn&quot; via Dammtor.

Until 2002, some Regionalbahn services were given S-Bahn numbers. Locomotive-hauled service between Hauptbahnhof and Ahrensburg was S4 (now RB 81); between Altona and Elmshorn was S5 (now RE 6 and RB 71); and, before the extension of electric services to Aumühle in 1969, the service between Bergedorf and Friedrichsruh was S6 (now RB 11 and RE 1). S3 was used for Regionalbahn services between Hauptbahnhof and Maschen and Neugraben (now RB 31 and RE 5) until the opening of the Harburg S-Bahn in 1983/1984.

(Stations with names bold in the following table offer a turning option)

== Projected extensions ==
Plans, currently shelved, would have the S-Bahn network dramatically increased. S-Bahn trains would go as far as Kaltenkirchen (the private AKN Eisenbahn currently connects to Kaltenkirchen from Eidelstedt).

=== S4 Hamburg - Bad Oldesloe ===
An expansion plan which is in proposal, is the opening (or reopening) of a line S4. Plans for this have been around since the 1960s. 
Whilst planning the City S-Bahn and network extensions of the 1960s, the German railway thought of building an S-Bahn line S4. This line will Altona in a north westerly direction towards Itzehoe via Elmshorn, being an Express line until Pinneberg. To the east of the city, the new line should have travelled with the current S1 and S11 to Hasselbrook and from there further to the northeast direction via Wandsbek to Ahrensburg along the existing regional train line.

Only the eastern part of the line from Hauptbahnhof was implemented, as a regional railway line, which was designated a S-Bahn line, since the HVV did not offer travel with regional railways at the time, but wanted its fare system to be valid on the line.

Since September 2000, a popular initiative in Stormarn has been working for the improvement of the S4, today the RB 81. The initiative is currently basing their arguments on a feasibility study which was ordered by S-Bahn Hamburg GmbH in the year 2002, and in principle dusted off the plans from the 1960s. According to the study, the extension involves upgrading the line to proper S-Bahn standards, served by EMUs and the addition of extra stations. The first step would be the improvement of the line as far as Ahrensburg, with a further intended step being the continuation to Bad Oldesloe. Dual-system trains would be necessary for the new line like those used on the extension to Stade. A third rail would be built as far as Ahrensburg, from where the trains would use the existing tracks with overhead lines.

As of November 2019, those plans are already approved, with the construction of the line scheduled for 2020.

==== Route and Stations ====

The route will be removed from the existing network at the &quot;Hasselbrook&quot; S and regional train stop and along the Lübeck – Hamburg route via Rahlstedt to Ahrensburg and Bad Oldesloe run. The route corresponds to the course of the regional train line RB81, which between 1966 and 2002 was already tariffed as an S-Bahn to &quot;Ahrensburg&quot; and operated under the name S4, but served by locomotive-hauled push-pull trains.
For the expansion of the line, a double-track S-Bahn line will be created between &quot;Hasselbrook&quot; and &quot;Ahrensburg&quot;, and a single-track S-Bahn line to &quot;Gartenholz &quot;, then the S-Bahn trains will switch to the long-distance network and cross over this &quot;Bad Oldesloe &quot;. The new line has a length of around , the total length of the route between &quot;Hasselbrook&quot; and Bad Oldesloe is . The route is planning divided into the four sections `` Hasselbrook - Luetkensallee &quot;, `` Luetkensallee - state border Hamburg / Schleswig-Holstein &quot;, `` state border - Gartenholz &quot;and ``Gartenholz - Bad Oldesloe &quot;. The first three are also the sections that have been or will be individually plan approval. No separate approval procedure is required for the fourth section, as no construction work is planned for it.

In the Hamburg area, the four new stops &quot;Wandsbek Rathaus &quot;, &quot;Bovestraße &quot;, &quot;Holstenhofweg&quot; and &quot;Am Pulverhof&quot; are being built, the existing regional train station &quot;Wandsbek&quot; will be replaced by &quot;Wandsbek Rathaus&quot; and &quot;Bovestrasse&quot; replaced. In Schleswig-Holstein, the establishment of an additional stopping point near the existing U-Bahn station &quot;Ahrensburg West&quot; is planned. The platforms of the existing stations will be adjusted in height and length for S-Bahn operations; In &quot;Tonndorf &quot;, &quot;Ahrensburg &quot;, &quot;Kupfermühle&quot; and &quot;Bad Oldesloe&quot; the existing systems can be raised to the height of 96 cm customary in the S-Bahn network, in &quot;Rahlstedt &quot;, &quot;Gartenholz&quot; and &quot;Bargteheide&quot; this requires a completely new building. In the first step, all platforms will be built with a length of at least 140 m, a later expansion to serve the route with long trains was taken into account in the planning. Furthermore, the existing level crossings with other types of traffic along the Route eliminated. For nature conservation reasons, complex structures are sometimes required, such as a wide-span new bridge in the nature reserve &quot;Stellmoor-Ahrensburger Tunneltal&quot;, which in the context of the planning process leads to delays and More costs resulted.

=== New S-Bahn Network (from the end of 2023) ===
In June 2022, The S-Bahn Hamburg announced a new network system which will be in effect starting December 2023 on the nationwide schedule switch. The new network also introduced the 5- minute interval waiting times, replacing its original 10 minute intervals on majority of train lines. 

The S1 travels from its original line track of Airport/Poppenbüttel to Blankenese/Wedel and vice versa with the addition of Ottensen S-Bahn Station in between Altona and Bahrenfeld.

The S2, however replaces all trains such as S11, S21, and S31 that passes by „Verbindungsbahn“ (via Dammtor, Sternschanze and Holstenstrasse) since the track runs from Aumühle to Altona via Dammtor and back.

The S3 still runs up from Pinneberg, however only ends until Neugraben and vice versa via the Citytunnel. In light of the track shorting for the S3, 

the S5 is introduced and runs between Elbgaustraße and Stade vice versa via the Verbindungsbahn, without stop in Altona. The S6 is still being planned but is rumored to extend from Kaltenkirchen to Neugraben via the Citytunnel.


== Rolling stock ==

The S-Bahn uses three-car electrical multiple units (EMUs), 447 vehicles of the following types: 
* Type 470, built from 1959 until 1970, in service until 2002 (central carriage of type 870)
* Type 471, built from 1939 until 1958, in service until 2001 (central carriage of type 871)
* Type 472, built from 1974 until 1984, in service until 2022 (central carriage of type 473)
* Type 474, built from 1996 until 2007 (central carriage of type 874)
* Type 490, built from 2013

Single three-carriage trains are designated &quot;short trains&quot;. Units can be combined to form a &quot;full train&quot; with six carriages or a &quot;long train&quot; with nine carriages.

Until 2001, the S-Bahn was one of very few suburban railway systems to offer two classes of service. A quieter and more comfortable first class was available for a 50% supplement.

Only type 474 and type 490 trains are in regular service. The last remaining type 470 and type 471 trains were removed from service in 2002 and 2001 respectively and the 472 trains in 2022. The type 474 trains primarily serve lines S1, S2 and S5, type 490 lines S3, S2 and S5.

With the extension of the S-Bahn to Stade, new dual-system trains have been deployed. These are identical to the type 474 units but with a pantograph on the central carriage to collect 15 kV alternate current from overhead lines.

With the introduction of type 474, the colour scheme of ivory and teal was replaced by a colour called &quot;Traffic Red&quot; (RAL 3020). External advertising covering the entire bodies of trains was abandoned at this time.

The implementation of a consistent corporate design led to type 472 trains being updated with the new colour scheme. This has left the Berlin S-Bahn as the only German S-Bahn train types with an individual design.

Type 474 trains were initially in the same colour scheme as the type DT4 trains of the Hamburg U-Bahn (white, grey, red). This early experiment was quickly given up.

In 2013, 60 trains are ordered from Bombardier for 327 million euros. The trains are being delivered since 2016. These trains were at first, and to a lesser extent still are, notorious for their sensitive doors, making them more prone to delays.

There are three preserved trains, number 170 082 known as a &#x27;museum train&#x27; and numbers 470 128 with 471 082 known as &#x27;traditional trains&#x27;. These trains are used for different events throughout the year and in particular in the lead up to Christmas.

== Stations ==

The S-Bahn has 68 stations, of which ten are fully underground. These are the five stations along the City-S-Bahn (&quot;Jungfernstieg&quot;, &quot;Stadthausbrücke&quot;, &quot;Landungsbrücken&quot;, &quot;Reeperbahn&quot; and &quot;Königstraße&quot;), the S-Bahn area of &quot;Altona&quot; station, the three stations in the centre of Harburg (&quot;Harburg&quot;, &quot;Harburg Rathaus&quot; and &quot;Heimfeld&quot;) and at Hamburg Airport. At the Hauptbahnhof, the westbound platforms are also in tunnel.

Most stations consist of a single island platform. At the interchange stations &quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot; and &quot;Altona&quot; there are two island platforms, one for trains to the city centre and one for the other direction. At &quot;Neugraben&quot; and &quot;Pinneberg&quot; termini the two S-Bahn tracks are between a side platform and an island platform, on the other side of which regional rail trains stop. Side platforms are at the triple-track stations at &quot;Bergedorf&quot;, &quot;Berliner Tor (lower level)&quot;, &quot;Blankenese&quot; and &quot;Harburg Rathaus&quot;, the twin-track station at &quot;Billwerder-Moorfleet&quot; and at the only single-track station, &quot;Iserbrook&quot;.

All stations have electronic passenger information systems showing information about the line, destination, route, length and stopping position of the next train, missed connections and temporary disturbances to service.

Some stations, for example &quot;Landungsbrücken&quot; and &quot;Harburg Rathaus&quot;, are designed as civilian shelters. The heavy protective entrance doors are the only sign of this dual use.

== Service time and intervals ==
Trains run daily from about 04:30 to 01:00. There is an all-night service within the Hamburg section on the nights before Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays in Germany. 

The base frequency for lines S1, S21, S3 and S31 during the day is 10 minutes; before 06:00, after 23:00 and during weekend night service, the frequency is 20 minutes. Multiple lines running on the same tracks, mainly through the city centre but also along the routes served by the S2/S21 and the S3/S31, have shorter intervals. Peak-time lines S2 and S11 decrease intervals in the morning and afternoon.

<doc id="1267430" wikidata="Q4317446" url="?curid=1267430" title="Rib (aeronautics)">
<text>In an aircraft, ribs are forming elements of the airframe structure of a wing, especially in traditional construction.

By analogy with the anatomical definition of &quot;rib&quot;, the ribs attach to the main spar, and by being repeated at frequent intervals, form a skeletal shape for the wing. Usually ribs incorporate the airfoil shape of the wing, and the skin adopts this shape when stretched over the ribs.

==Type of ribs==

There are several types of ribs. Form-ribs, plate-type ribs, truss ribs, closed-ribs, forged ribs and milled ribs, where form-ribs are used for light to medium loading and milled ribs offer the greatest strength.
* Form-ribs are made from a sheet of metal bent into shape, such as a U-profile. This profile is placed on the skin, just like a stringer, but then in the other direction.
* Plate-type ribs consist of sheet-metal, which has upturned edges and (often has) weight-saving holes cut into it.
* Truss ribs are built up out of profiles that are joined together. These joints require great attention during design and manufacture. The ribs may be light or heavy in design which make them suitable for a wide range of loads.
* Closed-ribs are constructed from profiles and sheet metal and are suitable for closing off sections of the wing (e.g.: the fuel tank). Here too, particular care must be taken with the joints and this type of rib is also suitable for application in a variety of loading conditions.
* Forged ribs are manufactured using heavy press-machinery. The result is fairly rough; for more refined parts, high-pressure presses are required, which are very expensive. Forged pieces (usually) have to undergo further treatment (for smoother edges and holes). Forged ribs are used for sections where very high loads apply - near the undercarriage for example.
* Milled ribs are solid structures. They are manufactured by milling away excess material from a solid block of metal (usually using computer-controlled milling machines). The shape of these ribs is always accurately defined. Such ribs are used under similar conditions as those for forged ribs.

Ribs are made out of wood, metal, plastic, composites, foam. The wings of kites, hang gliders, paragliders, powered kites, powered hang gliders, ultralights, windmills are aircraft that have versions that use ribs to form the wing shape.

For full size and flying model aircraft wing structures that are usually made of wood, ribs can either be in one piece (forming the airfoil at that rib&#x27;s &quot;station&quot; in the wing), or be in a three-piece format, with the &quot;rib web&quot; being the part that the one-piece rib consisted of, with &quot;capstrips&quot; for the upper and lower edging of the rib, running from the leading edge to the trailing edge, being the other two component parts.

<doc id="1267433" wikidata="Q955224" url="?curid=1267433" title="Bridge convention">
<text>A bridge convention is an agreement about an artificial or a set of related artificial calls. Calls made during the auction phase of a contract bridge game convey information about the player&#x27;s card holdings. Calls may be &quot;natural&quot; (that is, are based on a holding of the suit bid, or a balanced distribution in the case of a notrump bid) or &quot;&quot; (show a feature unrelated to the named denomination).

== Purpose ==
Contract bridge is a trick-taking card game played by four players in two competing partnerships in which a sequence of , also known as the auction, precedes the play of the cards. The purpose of this bidding is for players to inform their partners of the content of their hand and to arrive at a suitable contract at which to play the hand (or to prevent the opponents from arriving at a suitable contract). Although bidding is often &quot;natural&quot; (describing a hand by simple reference to possession, shape, and strength of the named suit), players may also bid using conventions, which assign more specific information to certain calls, particularly at the more advanced levels of competitive play. Bill Root defines &quot;convention&quot; as, &quot;A specific agreement between partners to give an unusual meaning to a bid&quot;. However, some conventions, for example, Stayman, are very widely used and cannot be said to be unusual.

Conventions are often named after their ostensive author (the Drury convention), their promulgator (the Stayman convention), or the methodology itself (the strong two clubs convention).

The term &quot;conventional&quot; is also used to describe certain opening leads, discards and signals that have specific agreed meanings.

Conventions to be played must be agreed by partners before play begins and must be disclosed to their opponents, either in advance by the use of or by alerts, announcements, and answers to questions about one&#x27;s partner&#x27;s bids once bidding has begun. Generally, this disclosure also must include the negative implications of choosing the bid over another alternative. Failure to reveal fully the existence and meaning of a convention generally constitutes an illegal communication of information between partners.

Perhaps the most widely known and used conventions are Blackwood, which asks for and gives information about the number of aces and kings held, Stayman convention, used to discover a 4-4 fit in a major suit following an opening no trump bid, Jacoby transfers, used to find a 5-3 fit in a major suit, and strong two clubs to show a very strong hand (usually at least 22 HCP). It could be argued that takeout doubles are conventional but their usage is so widespread that they may be considered a natural call.

==Classification==

Bridge conventions can be classified according to their purpose:

*Opening bid conventions
**Strong opening bids are used for hands stronger than the &quot;normal&quot; opening bid range (12-20 points in natural systems, 12-15/17 points in artificial systems)
***Strong two clubs in natural systems denote hands of 22+ high card points
***Benjamin Twos in natural systems 
***Strong one club in strong club systems denotes hands of 16-17+ points
**Weak opening bids are used for hands weaker than the normal opening bid range, but with preemptive value:
***Standard preemptive bids, including &quot;weak two&quot; Bids
***Kamikaze 1NT
***Ekren
***Muiderberg
**Other opening bid conventions:
***Flannery
***Multi 2 diamonds
***Namyats
*Fit-seeking conventions are used in constructive bidding, in order to find a fit—a suit suitable to be a trump suit
**Baron
**Checkback Stayman
**Forcing notrump
**Jacoby transfers
**New minor forcing
**Stayman
**Bergen raises
**LTC
**Jacoby 2NT (also known as Stenberg 2NT)
*Slam-seeking conventions are used in constructive bidding to investigate the possibility of a slam contract
**Asking bids
**Blackwood
**Cue bids
**Gerber
**Grand slam force
**Last Train
**Quantitative notrump bids
**Relay bids
**Splinter bid
**Serious 3NT
*Defensive conventions or interventions are used to show a specific type of hand after the opponents have opened the bidding
**Takeout double
**Unassuming Cue Bid in reply to overcalls
**Lebensohl over weak two bids
**Defenses over 1 NT, including two- and multi-suited overcalls:
*** Astro, Aspro, Asptro
*** Cappelletti
*** CoCa
*** CRASH
*** DONT
*** Hamilton
*** Landy
*** Lionel
*** Meckwell
*** Multi-defense
*** Multi-Landy
*** Suction
**Two-suited overcalls over suit openings, like
***Copenhagen convention
***CRO
***Ghestem
***Leaping Michaels
***Michaels cuebid
***Raptor convention
***Roman two-suiters
***Unusual notrump
*Counter-interventions present a countermeasure after opponents&#x27; conventional and natural interventions:
**Lebensohl
**Negative double
**Negative free bid
**Rubensohl
**Unusual vs. unusual
*Other:
**Game trial bids
**Lightner double
**Texas transfer

==Regulations==
Under the rules of the sponsoring organization (for example national federations such as American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) and the English Bridge Union (EBU), zonal organizations, and the World Bridge Federation (WBF)), certain conventions are &quot;alertable&quot;, the partner of the player making the conventional call must say &quot;alert&quot; (or show an alert card from the bidding box) before the right-hand opponent calls. The right-hand opponent may ask the alerter about the meaning of the convention, or may proceed as usual. If the right-hand opponent does not ask about the convention, their partner may do so when it is their turn. Under ACBL and EBU rules, some conventions are also &quot;announced&quot;, for example Jacoby transfers. When a player makes a transfer bid, his or her partner must say, &quot;transfer&quot; (or, under EBU rules, state the suit in question).

Sponsoring organizations can require players at all or some levels of competition to have a convention card which is a form completed by the partnership, containing general notes of the system, together with the definition of conventional bids, leads, discards and signals. In ACBL-sanctioned games, all pairs are obliged to have such a card, which must be identical for both members of the partnership. On the ACBL convention card, alertable conventions are shown in red and announceable ones in blue.

Sponsoring organizations may also ban the usage of certain conventions or restrict their use to certain levels of competition; examples are the use of &quot;ambiguous&quot; suits to disrupt opponent&#x27;s bidding. WBF classifies most &quot;strong pass&quot; and &quot;either-or&quot; methods into so-called HUM (highly unusual methods) and brown sticker conventions, and restricts their usage on WBF-sponsored events. Other zonal and national organizations often do the same. In general, ACBL tends to be more restrictive in allowed usage of conventions than European organizations.

<doc id="1267434" wikidata="Q7178778" url="?curid=1267434" title="Petri Walli">
<text>Petri Ilari Walli (February 25, 1969 – June 28, 1995) was the founder, vocalist, guitar-player, songwriter and producer of the Finnish psychedelic rock-band Kingston Wall.

Petri was born in Finland, his brother is Aki Walli. He also has a half-brother Hasse Walli who is a Finnish guitarist.

Petri (aka Pete) founded the band called Kingston Wall in 1987, and he was the spirit behind the whole band. They came out with three albums in 1992, 1993 and 1994, and broke up in December the same year as the last album was released. The break-up was Walli&#x27;s idea, as he wanted Kingston Wall to be on a hiatus for an unspecified time. After the break-up Petri travelled to Goa, India, where he had been multiple times before with his friend Ior Bock. (There is not much written text about Petri&#x27;s and Ior&#x27;s friendship, so nobody knows exactly how good friends they were). Petri ended his life by jumping off the balcony of the Töölö Church in Töölö, Helsinki the following summer. Walli was later buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery, only about one kilometer away from his place of death.

Petri loved the eastern culture, philosophy, Scandinavian mythologies and most of all, playing guitar.
There have been numerous rumours and speculation about the reasons of his suicide. Some say that he committed suicide because of his failed relationship with a Finnish girl called Tanja or Tanya, others say that he was in a spiritual turmoil which reflected on the lyrics and themes on Kingston Wall&#x27;s last album, &quot;Tri-Logy&quot;. The song &quot;For All Mankind&quot; from &quot;Tri-Logy&quot; is considered by many to be Walli&#x27;s suicide note.

Petri&#x27;s co-musicians in Kingston Wall were Jukka Jylli (bass) and Sami Kuoppamäki (drums). Sometimes they had guest musicians performing on their albums and live shows, such as Sakari Kukko (saxophone) and Kimmo Kajasto (synth). Drummers Petteri Ståhl and Timo &quot;Tinde&quot; Joutsimäki played drums in Kingston Wall before Kuoppamäki joined the group.

<doc id="1267440" wikidata="Q910396" url="?curid=1267440" title="Sandiás">
<text>Sandiás is a municipality of Galicia, Spain, next to Xinzo de Limia in the province of Ourense. Its estimated population is 1,585, distributed among 3 parishes (Couso de Limia, Piñeira de Arcos, Sandiás). Its area is 53 km2, a great part of which is drained fields from the Antela lagoon. This is an agricultural area. Potatoes and cereals are the most important crop. Sand extractions are also important for local development.

== History ==
The first sign of inhabitants are the remains of lake dwellings (lake dwelling) in the Antela lagoon. Due to Roman milestone findings, it is known that a Roman road (Roman road XVIII or Via Nova) passed through the area; there is also a Roman mansion in the village of Sandiás.

In the Middle Ages, its castle witnessed the struggle for the secession of Portugal, fights among the nobles, and peasant riots. Portuguese and Southern Spanish pilgrims (Via the “Silver road”) went through Sandiás on their way to Santiago de Compostela (Way of St James).

== Important landmarks ==
The council has an interesting and rich historical artistic heritage.
As for the religious architecture, we must highlight the Gothic church of Santo Estevo de Sandiás, work made by Bartolomé de Nosendo, around 1520.

The hermitage of San Bieito da Uceira has an only nave and it has a front crowned with a bulrush and a bell tower with two pyramids on the sides. Inside it, there is a baroque or neo classical altarpiece with the images of San Ramón, Santa Lucía and San Bieito.
Other churches are Santa María in Couso de Limia, the chapel of Arcos, the chapel of Coalloso, the chapel in Zadagós...
As for the civil constructions we can highlight the medieval tower of the Castro. Other interesting constructions are the three stately homes and a house that belonged to the nobility. The Casona in Santa Ana with L shape floor, with a big door and an interesting shield, has a chapel. The stately home of Espido presents a rectangular floor, a curious chimney and, on the main door, several shields. Its chapel with wooden baroque altarpiece is beside the building. Another stately home is the one of Penedo, risen in two stages. The first part is from the 16th century (1552) and the newest one from the 18th century (1758). This last one has rectangular floor. The chapel of the stately home dates from 1542. The third stately home is the one of Telleiro. Its U shape stands out, two shields and the wall that closes this building. It is thought to be from the late 17th century but it had important modifications in the following century. It also has a circular dovecote but it is not inside the wall. It used to have a chapel.

===St. Stephen&#x27;s church===
An example of Galician renaissance art. Built before 1520. The front piece belongs to the ¨manuelino¨ style (Portuguese style, rare in Galicia). The altarpiece was built in 1603 by the famous Galician sculptor Bartolome de Moure. It has a nave and a rectangular apse, arches over columns with capitals with Renaissant motives.

===The tower of the old castle===

Probably built in the first half of the 12th century (although some legends say it was built in the 9th century), it was located over a castrum (Celtic settlement). It participated in the Portugal secession wars (XII). In 1386 it was assaulted by the duke of Lancaster, pretender to the Castile crown. In the 15th century it was demolished by a popular riot, and rebuilt later. It was a meeting point for troops in the wars with Portugal in the 18th century. There are many legends about this castle.

<doc id="1267442" wikidata="Q1327664" url="?curid=1267442" title="Electrotonic potential">
<text>In physiology, electrotonus refers to the passive spread of charge inside a neuron and between cardiac muscle cells or smooth muscle cells. &quot;Passive&quot; means that voltage-dependent changes in membrane conductance do not contribute. Neurons and other excitable cells produce two types of electrical potential:
* &quot;Electrotonic&quot; potential (or graded potential), a non-propagated local potential, resulting from a local change in ionic conductance (e.g. synaptic or sensory that engenders a local current). When it spreads along a stretch of membrane, it becomes exponentially smaller (decrement).
* &quot;Action&quot; potential, a propagated impulse.

Electrotonic potentials represent changes to the neuron&#x27;s membrane potential that do not lead to the generation of new current by action potentials. However, all action potentials are begun by electrotonic potentials depolarizing the membrane above the threshold potential which converts the electrotonic potential into an action potential. Neurons which are small in relation to their length, such as some neurons in the brain, have only electrotonic potentials (starburst amacrine cells in the retina are believed to have these properties); longer neurons utilize electrotonic potentials to trigger the action potential.

Electrotonic potentials have an amplitude that is usually 5-20 mV and they can last from 1 ms up to several seconds long. In order to quantify the behavior of electrotonic potentials there are two constants that are commonly used: the membrane time constant τ, and the membrane length constant λ. The membrane time constant measures the amount of time for an electrotonic potential to passively fall to 1/e or 37% of its maximum. A typical value for neurons can be from 1 to 20 ms. The membrane length constant measures how far it takes for an electrotonic potential to fall to 1/e or 37% of its amplitude at the place where it began. Common values for the length constant of dendrites are from .1 to 1 mm. Electrotonic potentials are conducted faster than action potentials, but attenuate rapidly so are unsuitable for long-distance signaling. The phenomenon was first discovered by Eduard Pflüger.

== Summation ==
The electrotonic potential travels via electrotonic spread, which amounts to attraction of opposite and repulsion of like-charged ions within the cell. Electrotonic potentials can sum spatially or temporally. Spatial summation is the combination of multiple sources of ion influx (multiple channels within a dendrite, or channels within multiple dendrites), whereas temporal summation is a gradual increase in overall charge due to repeated influxes in the same location. Because the ionic charge enters in one location and dissipates to others, losing intensity as it spreads, electrotonic spread is a graded response. It is important to contrast this with the all-or-none law propagation of the action potential down the axon of the neuron.

== EPSPs ==
Electrotonic potential can either increase the membrane potential with positive charge or decrease it with negative charge. Electrotonic potentials that increase the membrane potential are called excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). This is because they depolarize the membrane, increasing the likelihood of an action potential. As they sum together they can depolarize the membrane sufficiently to push it above the threshold potential, which will then cause an action potential to occur. EPSPs are often caused by either Na+ or Ca2+ coming into the cell.

== IPSPs ==
Electrotonic potentials which decrease the membrane potential are called inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). They hyperpolarize the membrane and make it harder for a cell to have an action potential. IPSPs are associated with Cl− entering the cell or K+ leaving the cell. IPSPs can interact with EPSPs to &quot;cancel out&quot; their effect.

== Information Transfer ==
Because of the continuously varying nature of the electrotonic potential versus the binary response of the action potential, this creates implications for how much information can be encoded by each respective potential. Electrotonic potentials are able to transfer more information within a given time period than action potentials. This difference in information rates can be up to almost an order of magnitude greater for electrotonic potentials.

== Cable theory ==

Cable theory can be useful for understanding how currents flow through the axons of a neuron. In 1855, Lord Kelvin devised this theory as a way to describe electrical properties of transatlantic telegraph cables. Almost a century later in 1946, Hodgkin and Rushton discovered cable theory could be applied to neurons as well. This theory has the neuron approximated as a cable whose radius does not change, and allows it to be represented with the partial differential equation

: formula_1

where &quot;V&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) is the voltage across the membrane at a time &quot;t&quot; and a position &quot;x&quot; along the length of the neuron, and where λ and τ are the characteristic length and time scales on which those voltages decay in response to a stimulus. Referring to the circuit diagram on the right, these scales can be determined from the resistances and capacitances per unit length.

:formula_2
:formula_3

From these equations one can understand how properties of a neuron affect the current passing through it. The length constant λ, increases as membrane resistance becomes larger and as the internal resistance becomes smaller, allowing current to travel farther down the neuron. The time constant τ, increases as the resistance and capacitance of the membrane increase, which causes current to travel more slowly through the neuron.

== Ribbon synapses ==
Ribbon synapses are a type of synapse often found in sensory neurons and are of a unique structure that specially equips them to respond dynamically to inputs from electrotonic potentials. They are so named for an organelle they contain, the synaptic ribbon. This organelle can hold thousands of synaptic vesicles close to the presynaptic membrane, enabling neurotransmitter release that can quickly react to a wide range of changes in the membrane potential.

<doc id="1267453" wikidata="Q2357696" url="?curid=1267453" title="Rail fence cipher">
<text>The rail fence cipher (also called a zigzag cipher) is a classical type of transposition cipher. It derives its name from the manner in which encryption is performed, in analogy to a fence built with horizontal rails.

==Encryption==
In the rail fence cipher, the plaintext is written downwards diagonally on successive &quot;rails&quot; of an imaginary fence, then moving up when the bottom rail is reached, down again when the top rail is reached, and so on until the whole plaintext is written out. The ciphertext is then read off in rows. 

For example, to encrypt the message &#x27;WE ARE DISCOVERED. RUN AT ONCE.&#x27; with 3 &quot;rails&quot;, write the text as:

 W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . U . . . O . . . 
 . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . R . N . T . N . E 
 . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . A . . . C . 

(Spaces and punctuation are omitted.) Then read off the text horizontally to get the ciphertext:

 WECRUO ERDSOEERNTNE AIVDAC

==Decryption==
Let formula_1 be the number of rails used during encryption. Observe that as the plaintext is written, the sequence of each letter&#x27;s vertical position on the rails varies up and down in a repeating cycle. In the above example (where formula_2) the vertical position repeats with a period of 4. In general the sequence repeats with a period of formula_3.

Let formula_4 be the length of the string to be decrypted. Suppose for a moment that formula_4 is a multiple of formula_3 and let formula_7. One begins by splitting the ciphertext into strings such that the length of the first and last string is formula_8 and the length of each intermediate string is formula_9. For the above example with formula_10, we have formula_11, so we split the ciphertext as follows:

 WECRUO ERDSOEERNTNE AIVDAC

Write each string on a separate line with spaces after each letter in the first and last line:

 W E C R U O
 E R D S O E E R N T N E
 A I V D A C

Then one can read off the plaintext down the first column, diagonally up, down the next column, and so on.

If formula_4 is not a multiple of formula_3, the determination of how to split up the ciphertext is slightly more complicated than as described above, but the basic approach is the same. Alternatively, for simplicity in decrypting, one can pad the plaintext with extra letters to make its length a multiple of formula_3.
If the ciphertext has not been padded, but you either know or are willing to brute-force the number of rails used, you can decrypt it using the following steps.

As above, let formula_4 be the length of the string to be decrypted and let formula_1 be the number of rails used during encryption. We will add two variables, formula_17 and formula_18, where formula_19 = the number of diagonals in the decrypted Rail Fence, and formula_18 = the number of empty spaces in the last diagonal.

formula_21 

Next solve for formula_17 and formula_18 algebraically, where both values are the smallest number possible. This is easily done by incrementing formula_17 by 1 until the denominator is larger than formula_4, and then simply solving for formula_18. Consider the example cipher, modified to use 6 rails instead of 3.

 W...V...O
 .E...O.E...T.N
 ..A...C...R...A...C
 ...R...S...E...N...E
 ...E.I...D.U...
 ...D...R...
The resulting cipher text is:
 WVO EOETN ACRAC RSENE EIDU DR
We know that formula_10, and if we use formula_28 we can solve the equation above.

formula_29

formula_30 Simplify the fraction.

formula_31 Solve for formula_17

formula_33 Solve for formula_18

We now have formula_28, formula_36, and formula_37. Or, 6 rails, 5 diagonals (4+1), and 2 empty spaces at the end. By blocking out the empty spaces at the end of the last diagonal, we can simply fill in the Rail Fence line by line using the ciphertext.

==Cryptanalysis==
The cipher&#x27;s key is formula_1, the number of rails. If formula_1 is known, the ciphertext can be decrypted by using the above algorithm. Values of formula_1 equal to or greater than formula_4, the length of the ciphertext, are not usable, since then the ciphertext is the same as the plaintext. Therefore the number of usable keys is low, allowing the brute-force attack of trying all possible keys. As a result, the rail-fence cipher is considered weak.

==Zigzag cipher==
The term &quot;zigzag cipher&quot; may refer to the rail fence cipher as described above. However, it may also refer to a different type of cipher described by Fletcher Pratt in &quot;Secret and Urgent&quot;. It is &quot;written by ruling a sheet of paper in vertical columns, with a letter at the head of each column. A dot is made for each letter of the message in the proper column, reading from top to bottom of the sheet. The letters at the head of the columns are then cut off, the ruling erased and the message of dots sent along to the recipient, who, knowing the width of the columns and the arrangement of the letters at the top, reconstitutes the diagram and reads what it has to say.&quot;

<text>Webster Vienna Private University is a private American university in Vienna, Austria. While affiliated to the Webster University in St. Louis, USA, it remains a distinct and separate institution.

==History==
 Webster University was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, USA in 1915. After being impressed by a visit to the Webster Geneva campus, Vienna mayor Leopold Gratz invited Webster University to open a campus in Vienna as the country’s first and only American university beginning in 1981.

Originally located on the Schubertring in Vienna’s first district, the campus soon moved to Marokkanergasse, occupying a full three-story building. During this time in 1985, Webster Vienna became the first institution to offer an accredited MBA program in Austria. The university also became the first university in Austria to be run by a woman; Elisabeth Chopin served as Webster Vienna’s director from 1988 to 1999.

Due to a growing student population, in 1996, the campus relocated a second time to the 22nd district, Donaustadt. In the same year, Webster Vienna granted honorary doctorates to Kardinal König and former Austrian-Jewish Holocaust survivor, Simon Wiesenthal. Later, in 2007, the university also granted an honorary degree to acclaimed social psychologist Philip Zimbardo (of Stanford University near Palo Alto, California).

In 2001, Webster Vienna became the first and only American university to receive the Austrian private university accreditation.

In fall 2014, Webster Vienna moved to its current, modern campus in the historic Palais Wenkheim close to the city center. The newly renovated building provides technical equipment on more than 5,000 m² (or 55,000 sq ft).
On 15 October 2015 until the end of June 2016 Bernd Marin took over the director&#x27;s chair from Arthur Hirsh, who had served for 15 years. Johannes Pollak took over as new director as of July 2016.

<doc id="1267456" wikidata="Q38132" url="?curid=1267456" title="King Charles Spaniel">
<text>The King Charles Spaniel (also known as the English Toy Spaniel) is a small dog breed of the spaniel type. In 1903, The Kennel Club combined four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title. The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels, each of which contributed one of the four coat colours now seen in the breed.

Thought to have originated in East Asia, and possibly acquired by European traders via the Spice Road, early toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century. They became linked with English royalty during the rule of Queen Mary I (from 1553-1558), eventually earning their name after being made famous by their association with King Charles II. Ruling from 1660-1685, Charles II owned many small dogs which accompanied him and his entourage about their daily business. Members of the breed were also owned by Queen Victoria (Dash) and her great-granddaughter Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia.

The modern King Charles Spaniel, and the other types of toy spaniels, are likely the result of crossbreeding historic spaniels with other East Asian breeds (such as the Japanese Chin, Pekingese, and the Pug) in the early 19th century. This was done mainly to reduce the size of the nose and snout, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II&#x27;s time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.

Historically the breeds that were merged into the King Charles Spaniel were used for hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, including cardiac conditions and a range of eye problems.

== History ==
The King Charles Spaniel may share a common ancestry with the Pekingese and Japanese Chin.

The red and white variety of toy spaniel was first seen in paintings by Titian, including the &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot; (1538), where a small dog is used as a symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.

The earliest recorded appearance of a toy spaniel in England was in a painting of Queen Mary I and King Philip. Mary, Queen of Scots, was also fond of small toy dogs, including spaniels, showing the fondness of the British royalty for these types of dogs before Charles II.

King Henry III of France owned a number of small spaniels, which were called Damarets. Although one of the translations of John Caius&#x27; 1570 Latin work &quot;De Canibus Britannicis&quot; talks of &quot;a new type of Spaniel brought out of France, rare, strange, and hard to get&quot;, this was an addition in a later translation, and was not in the original text. Caius did discuss the &quot;Spainel-gentle, or Comforter&quot; though, which he classified as a delicate thoroughbred. This spaniel was thought to originate from Malta and was sought out only as a lapdog for &quot;daintie dames&quot;.

Captain John Saris may have brought back examples of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613, a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan on behalf of the United States in the mid-19th century. He noted that dogs were a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England.

===17th century and Charles II===

In the 17th century, toy spaniels began to feature in paintings by Dutch artists such as Caspar Netscher and Peter Paul Rubens. Spanish artists, including Juan de Valdés Leal and Diego Velázquez, also depicted them; in the Spanish works, the dogs were tricolour, black and white or entirely white. French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon would later describe these types of dogs as crosses between spaniels and Pugs.

King Charles II of England was very fond of the toy spaniel, which is why the dogs now carry his name, although there is no evidence that the modern breeds are descended from his particular dogs. He is credited with causing an increase in popularity of the breed during this period. Samuel Pepys&#x27; diary describes how the spaniels were allowed to roam anywhere in Whitehall Palace, including during state occasions. In an entry dated 4 September 1667, describing a council meeting, Pepys wrote, &quot;All I observed there was the silliness of the King, playing with his dog all the while and not minding the business.&quot; Charles&#x27; sister Princess Henrietta was painted by Pierre Mignard holding a small red and white toy-sized spaniel. Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, writing in her 1911 work &quot;Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors&quot;, theorised that after Henrietta&#x27;s death at the age of 26 in 1670, Charles took her dogs for himself.

===After Charles II===

Toy spaniels continued to be popular in the British court during the reign of King James II, through that of Queen Anne. Popular types included those of the white and red variety. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, the Pug was introduced into Britain which would eventually lead to drastic physical changes to the King Charles Spaniel. Comparisons between needlework pictures of English toy spaniels and the continental variety show that changes had already begun to take place in the English types by 1736, with a shorter nose being featured and the breed overall moving away from the one seen in earlier works by Anthony van Dyck during the 17th century.

English toy spaniels remained popular enough during the 18th century to be featured frequently in literature and in art. &quot;On Rover, a Lady&#x27;s Spaniel&quot;, Jonathan Swift&#x27;s satire of Ambrose Philips&#x27;s poem to the daughter of the Lord Lieutenant, describes the features of an English toy, specifying a &quot;forehead large and high&quot; among other physical characteristics of the breeds. Toy spaniels and Pugs were featured in both group portraits and satirical works by William Hogarth. Toy spaniels were still popular with the upper classes as ladies&#x27; dogs, despite the introduction of the Pug; both Thomas Gainsborough&#x27;s portrait of Queen Charlotte from 1781 and George Romney&#x27;s 1782 &quot;Lady Hamilton as Nature&quot; feature toy spaniels with their mistresses. The toy spaniels of this century weighed as little as , although they were thought to be the dog breed most prone to becoming overweight, or &quot;fattened&quot;.

===19th century and the Blenheim Spaniel===

The varieties of toy spaniel were occasionally used in hunting, as the &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s Repository&quot; reported in 1830 of the Blenheim Spaniel: &quot;Twenty years ago, His Grace the Duke of Marlborough was reputed to possess the smallest and best breed of cockers in Britain; they were invariably red–and–white, with very long ears, short noses, and black eyes.&quot; During this period, the term &quot;cocker&quot; was not used to describe a Cocker Spaniel, but rather a type of small spaniel used to hunt woodcock. The Duke&#x27;s residence, Blenheim Palace, gave its name to the Blenheim Spaniel. The &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s Repository&quot; explains that toy spaniels are able to hunt, albeit not for a full day or in difficult terrain: &quot;The very delicate and small, or &#x27;carpet spaniels,&#x27; have exquisite nose, and will hunt truly and pleasantly, but are neither fit for a long day or thorny covert.&quot; This idea was supported by Vero Shaw in his 1881 work &quot;The Illustrated Book of the Dog&quot;, and by Thomas Brown in 1829 who wrote, &quot;He is seldom used for field–sports, from his diminutive size, being easily tired, and is too short in the legs to get through swampy ground.&quot; During the 19th century, the Maltese was still considered to be a type of spaniel, and thought to be the parent breed of toy spaniels, including both the King Charles and Blenheim varieties.

The breeds of toy spaniel often rivalled the Pug in popularity as lapdogs for ladies. The disadvantage of the breeds of toy spaniel was that their long coats required constant grooming. By 1830, the toy spaniel had changed somewhat from the dogs of Charles II&#x27;s day. William Youatt in his 1845 study, &quot;The Dog&quot;, was not enamoured of the changes: &quot;The King Charles&#x27;s breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead as ugly and prominent as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its former size, and has an expression of stupidity with which the character of the dog too accurately corresponds.&quot; Youatt did concede that the breed&#x27;s long ears, coat and colouring were attractive. Due to the fashion of the period, the toy spaniels were crossed with Pugs to reduce the size of their noses and then selectively bred to reduce it further. By doing this, the dog&#x27;s sense of smell was impaired, and according to 19th century writers, this caused the varieties of toy spaniel to be removed from participation in field sports. Blunt-Lytton proposed that the red and white Blenheim Spaniels always had the shorter nose now seen in the modern King Charles.

From the 16th century, it was the fashion for ladies to carry small toy-sized spaniels as they travelled around town. These dogs were called &quot;Comforters&quot; and given the species biological classification of &quot;Canis consolator&quot; by 19th-century dog writers. By the 1830s, this practice was no longer in vogue, and these types of spaniels were becoming rarer. &quot;Comforter&quot; was given as a generic term to lapdogs, including the Maltese, the English Toy and Continental Toy Spaniels, the latter of which was similar to the modern Phalène. It was once believed that the dogs possessed some power of healing: in 1607 Edward Topsell repeated Caius&#x27; observation that &quot;these little dogs are good to asswage the sickness of stomach, being oftentimes thereunto applied as a plaister preservative, or bourne in the bosum of the diseased and weak person, which effect is performed by their moderate heat.&quot; By the 1840s, &quot;Comforter&quot; had dropped out of use, and the breed had returned to being called Toy Spaniels. The first written occurrence of a ruby coloured toy spaniel was a dog named Dandy, owned by a Mr Garwood in 1875.

The dogs continued to be popular with royalty. In 1896, Otto von Bismarck purchased a King Charles Spaniel from an American kennel for $1,000. The dog weighed less than , and had been disqualified from the Westminster Kennel Club the previous year on account of its weight. The average price was lower than that paid by Bismarck. In 1899, the price ranged between $50 and $200 for a King Charles or Blenheim, with the Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniel ranging between $50 and $150.

Anne Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Flossy&quot;, given to her by the Robinson children when she left her governorship of them, was a King Charles Spaniel.

===Conformation showing and the 20th century===

In 1903, the Kennel Club attempted to amalgamate the King James (black and tan), Prince Charles (tricolour), Blenheim and Ruby spaniels into a single breed called the Toy Spaniel. The Toy Spaniel Club, which oversaw those separate breeds, strongly objected, and the argument was only resolved following the intervention of King Edward VII, who made it clear that he preferred the name &quot;King Charles Spaniel&quot;. In 1904, the American Kennel Club followed suit, combining the four breeds into a single breed known as the English Toy Spaniel. The Japanese Spaniel was also considered a type of toy spaniel, but was not merged into the new breed and was recognised as a breed in its own right.

Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia owned a King Charles Spaniel at the time of the shooting of the Romanov family on 17 July 1918. Eight days later, Nicholas Sokolov of the White Forces found a clearing where he believed the bodies of the Romanov family had been burnt, and discovered the corpse of a King Charles Spaniel at the site. In 1920s, the Duchess of Marlborough bred so many King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace that her husband moved out and later evicted the Duchess herself.

Blunt-Lytton documented her attempts in the early 20th century to re-breed the 18th-century type of King Charles Spaniel as seen in the portraits of King Charles II. She used the Toy Trawler Spaniel, a curly haired, mostly black, small to medium-sized spaniel, and cross-bred these dogs with a variety of other breeds, including Blenheim Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels, in unsuccessful attempts to reproduce the earlier style.

The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel originated from a competition held by American Roswell Eldridge in 1926. He offered a prize fund for the best male and female dogs of &quot;Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England&#x27;s time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull.&quot; Breeders entered what they considered to be sub-par King Charles Spaniels. Although Eldridge did not live to see the new breed created, several breeders banded together and created the first breed club for the new Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in 1928, with the Kennel Club initially listing the new breed as &quot;King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type&quot;. In 1945, the Kennel Club recognised the new breed in its own right. The American Kennel Club did not recognise the Cavalier until 1997.

Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, continued the connection between royalty and the King Charles Spaniel, attending Princess Anne&#x27;s tenth birthday party with her dog Rolly in 1960. Elizabeth II has also owned King Charles Spaniels in addition to the dogs most frequently associated with her, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi.

In 2008, the BBC documentary &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; was critical of the breeding of a variety of pedigree breeds including the King Charles Spaniel. The show highlighted issues involving syringomyelia in both the King Charles and Cavalier breeds. Mark Evans, the chief veterinary advisor for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), said, &quot;Dog shows using current breed standards as the main judging criteria actively encourage both the intentional breeding of deformed and disabled dogs and the inbreeding of closely related animals&quot;; this opinion was seconded by the Scottish SPCA. Following the programme, the RSPCA ended its sponsorship of the annual Crufts dog show, and the BBC declined to broadcast the event.

The King Charles Spaniel is less popular than the Cavalier in both the UK and the US. In 2010, the Cavalier was the 23rd most popular breed, according to registration figures collected by the American Kennel Club, while the English Toy Spaniel was the 126th. In the UK, according to the Kennel Club, the Cavalier is the most popular breed in the Toy Group, with 8,154 puppies registered in 2010, compared to 199 registrations for King Charles Spaniels. Due to the low number of registrations, the King Charles was identified as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club in 2003 in an effort to help promote the breed.
== Description ==
The King Charles has large dark eyes, a short nose, a high domed head and a line of black skin around the mouth. On average, it stands at the withers, with a small but compact body. The breed has a traditionally docked tail, except in the UK and some other European Countries where docking and cropping has been illegal since 2006. Cropping of ears has been illegal in the UK for over 100 years. It has the long pendulous ears typical of a spaniel and its coat comes in four varieties, trait it shares with its offshoot, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

The four sets of markings reflect the four former breeds from which the modern breed was derived. Black and tan markings are known as &quot;King Charles&quot;, while &quot;Prince Charles&quot; is tricoloured, &quot;Blenheim&quot; is red and white, and &quot;Ruby&quot; is a single-coloured solid rich red. The &quot;King Charles&quot; black and tan markings typically consist of a black coat with mahogany/tan markings on the face, legs and chest and under the tail. The tricoloured &quot;Prince Charles&quot; is mostly white with black patches and mahogany/tan markings in similar locations to the &quot;King Charles&quot;. The &quot;Blenheim&quot; has a white coat with red patches, and should have a distinctive red spot in the center of the skull.

King Charles Spaniels are often mistaken for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. There are several significant differences between the two breeds, the principal being the size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between , the King Charles is smaller at . In addition, their facial features, while similar, are distinguishable: the Cavalier&#x27;s ears are set higher and its skull is flat, while the King Charles&#x27; is domed. Finally, the muzzle length of the King Charles tends to be shorter than the typical muzzle on a Cavalier.

The American Kennel Club has two classes, English Toy Spaniel (B/PC) (Blenheim and Prince Charles) and English Toy Spaniel (R/KC), while in the UK, the Kennel Club places the breed in a single class. Under the Fédération Cynologique Internationale groups, the King Charles is placed in the English Toy Spaniel section within the Companion and Toy Dog Group, along with the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

== Temperament ==

The King Charles is a friendly breed, to the extent that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.

The breed can tolerate other pets well, although the King Charles still has the hunting instincts of its ancestors and may not always be friendly towards smaller animals. It is intelligent enough to be used for obedience work and, due to its stable temperament, it can be a successful therapy dog for hospitals and nursing homes.

==Health==
A natural bobtail can be found in some members of the breed, which is not a mutation of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.

===Eye and heart conditions===
The eye problems associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy.

Heart conditions related to the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers of the heart and eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.

===Other common issues===
Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be sensitive to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs&#x27; narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs&#x27; ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which may be associated with cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.

There are several breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull issues such as an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A complication from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where two or more of the dog&#x27;s toes are fused together, may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.

== Urban myth ==
An urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK, overriding &quot;no dog except guide dogs&quot; rules. A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament. This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

The UK Parliament website states: &quot;Contrary to popular rumour, there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster. We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it.&quot; Similarly, there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK. A spokesman for the Kennel Club said: &quot;This law has been quoted from time to time. It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn&#x27;t tracked it down.&quot;

<text>Loch of Skene is a large lowland, freshwater loch in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It lies approximately to the west of the village of Kirkton of Skene and west of Aberdeen.

The loch is partially man-made, being dammed at its outflow on the southern shore to form a reservoir. Before 1905, water from the loch was used in the making of tweed and to turn the mill wheel at the Garlogie Mills. The mills closed in 1905. From 1923, the water was used to generate electricity. The loch is about 6 foot deep at its deepest.

==Flora and fauna==
The loch is designated as a Special Protection Area, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Ramsar site for wildlife conservation purposes.

The loch supports concentrations of wildfowl in autumn and winter in particular greylag geese, goldeneye ducks and pink-footed geese. Common gulls are also found on the loch.
Reedbed and a birch and willow carr fringe the loch perimeter.

Pike are found in the loch and a permit is required for fishing.

==Recreation==
The &quot;Aberdeen and Stonehaven Yacht Club&quot; is based at the loch. 

==Survey==
The loch was surveyed on 17 July 1905 by T.N. Johnston and L.W. Collett and later charted as part of the Sir John Murray&#x27;s &quot;Bathymetrical Survey of Fresh-Water Lochs of Scotland 1897-1909&quot;.

<text>Andrés Manuel del Río y Fernández (10 November 1764 – 23 March 1849) was a Spanish scientist, naturalist and engineer who discovered compounds of &quot;vanadium&quot; in 1801. He proposed that the element be given the name &quot;panchromium&quot;, or later, &quot;erythronium&quot;, but his discovery was not credited at the time, and his names were not used.

== Education ==
Andrés del Río studied analytical chemistry and metallurgy in Spain, where he was born. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Alcalá de Henares in 1780 at the age of fifteen. The government gave him a scholarship to enter the Royal Academy of Mines in Almadén, Spain, as of June 1782. He showed great aptitude. In 1783 he was given a travel grant by the Spanish Ministry of Mines. He used it to study in Paris, with the chemist Jean Darcet at the Collège de France.

Del Río continued his studies at the Mining Academy in Freiberg, Germany, under the direction of Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1789. In Freiberg he got to know Baron Alexander von Humboldt. Del Río went on to study at the Austrian Imperial-Royal Mining Academy at Schemnitz, Hungary, with Anton von Rupprecht, as well as in England.

Del Rio returned to Paris in 1791 where he was a colleague (&quot;asociado&quot;) of Antoine Lavoisier, who is considered the founder of modern chemistry, and Abbé René Just Haüy, who is considered the founder of crystallography. As a result of the French Revolution, a warrant for Lavoisier&#x27;s arrest was issued on 4 November 1793. Lavoisier was executed on the guillotine on 8 May 1794. After Lavoisier&#x27;s arrest, Del Río escaped to England.

== Mining in New Spain ==
In 1792, the Real Seminario de Minería (College of Mines) was founded in New Spain by a decree of King Charles III of Spain, with the object of reforming the study of mining and metallurgy in the colony. The institution was initially headed by Fausto Elhúyar (1755–1833), the discoverer of tungsten.
In 1793, Elhúyar offered Del Río a position as chair at the newly organized college. Del Rio refused the chair of chemistry, but accepted that of mineralogy.
Del Río arrived at the port of Veracruz on 20 October 1794, on the ship &quot;San Francisco de Alcántara&quot; out of Cádiz.

Once in his new position, del Río dedicated himself to teaching and scientific investigation. On 27 April 1795 he opened the first course in mineralogy ever presented in New Spain. He made important studies of minerals and developed innovative methods in mining. He also wrote the first textbook of mineralogy to be published anywhere in America, &quot;Elementos de Orictognosía&quot;, and the first in Spanish rather than German or English. Volume I appeared in 1795, and volume II in 1805. Santiago Ramírez, his student and later his biographer, described it as &quot;a monumental work, which... will be an object of veneration and consultation&quot;.

German naturalist, Alexander von Humboldt, making a survey of resources in Spanish-held colonies for Spain, reported favorably that it was in Mexico where the best work of mineralogy in Spanish had been published, the &quot;Elementos de Orictognosia&quot; of Señor Del Rio.
Humboldt spent the period from March 1803 to March 1804 in Mexico City, renewing his friendship with del Rio and actively participating in the investigations of the College of Mining. He organized excursions to Chapultepec, to the basaltic zone of Pedregal de San Ángel, the lava fields of the Xitle volcano, and to the hot springs of Peñón de los Baños, a rocky outcrop close to the modern Mexico City International Airport, accumulating data and samples of minerals and rocks that were then submitted to chemical tests for identification.

In 1820 del Río was named a deputy to the Spanish Cortes. He was a liberal who argued for the independence of New Spain. He was in Madrid when Mexico gained its independence. Invited to remain in Spain, he nevertheless returned to Mexico (in 1821), which he considered his homeland.

In 1829, amidst the Spanish attempts to reconquer Mexico, the government of independent Mexico expelled the Spaniards resident in the country, with some notable exceptions. Del Río was one of the exceptions. The expulsion had a major impact on the work of the College of Mining. The director, Fausto Elhúyar, was forced to resign and leave the country.

Indignant over the expulsion of his colleagues, del Río showed solidarity by himself entering voluntary exile in Philadelphia for four years. There he was highly honored. He took part in the scientific activities of the American Philosophical Society (elected 1830) and was elected president of the Geological Society of Philadelphia. John Hurtel of Philadelphia published a new edition of del Rio&#x27;s book in 1832. Del Rio returned to Mexico in 1834 and again occupied the chair of mineralogy at the college. He was also given the chair of geology.

== The discovery of vanadium ==

In 1801, while examining mineral samples sent to him by the Purísima del Cardenal mine in Zimapán in the State of Hidalgo, del Río arrived at the conclusion that he had found a new metallic element. He prepared various compounds of the element, and observing their diverse colors, he named the element &quot;panchromium&quot; (Greek: παγχρώμιο &quot;all colors&quot;). Later, on observing that the compounds changed color to red on heating, he substituted the name &quot;erythronium&quot; (Greek: ερυθρός &quot;red&quot;).

The following year he gave samples containing the new element to Alexander von Humboldt, who sent them on to Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils in París for his analysis. Collet-Descotils&#x27;s analysis found (mistakenly) that the samples contained only chromium. Humboldt, in turn, rejected del Río&#x27;s claim of the discovery of a new element, and del Río himself concluded his discovery had been an error.

In 1830, 27 years after its initial discovery, Professor Nils Gabriel Sefström of Sweden rediscovered the element in a sample of iron of Taberg. He gave it its current name, &quot;vanadium&quot;, in honor of the Scandinavian goddess of love and beauty, Vanadis.
In the same year, Friedrich Wöhler, the German chemist who had synthesized urea, analyzed some of del Río&#x27;s samples of brown lead ore of Zimapán and demonstrated that Sefström&#x27;s vanadium and del Rio&#x27;s erythronium were the same.

In 1831 the U.S. geologist George William Featherstonhaugh proposed without success that the element should be named &quot;rionium&quot;, in honor of its original discoverer. An extensive analysis of the publication history of papers relating to the discovery of the element suggests that the intervention of J. J. Berzelius on behalf of his students Sefström and Wöhler, was highly instrumental in influencing the element&#x27;s attribution and naming, reflecting patterns of scientific prestige and control of discourse in the first half of the nineteenth century.

In 1867 the English chemist Henry Enfield Roscoe isolated the pure metal for the first time. He used hydrogen to get rid of the chloride around the pure vanadium.

== Later life ==
In 1805 del Río established an ironworks at Coalcomán. After overcoming numerous obstacles, he produced the first iron in Mexico, on 29 April 1807. Four years later, during the Mexican War of Independence, the royalists destroyed the ironworks. The iron he produced was superior to the celebrated imported iron from Biscay (Vizcaya), Spain.

Del Rio was bitter about Humboldt&#x27;s mistake in not confirming the discovery of vanadium, and strongly reproached him.
He continued to teach at the College of Mines until his death, a course that &quot;could well have been taught at the Polytechnic school in Paris&quot;, according to Michel Chevalier, who visited del Río shortly before the latter&#x27;s death.

== Death and recognition ==
Andrés Manuel del Río died at 84 in 1849, after a long and productive academic career. His work and his liberal politics were important to the building of an independent Mexican nation. He was the founding professor of mineralogy at the College of Mines, which laid the base for the current Institute of Geology of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

He was a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid, the Wernerian Natural History Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Academy of Sciences of France, the Economic Society of Leipzig, the Linnean Society of Leipzig, the Royal Academy of Saxony and the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. He was also president of the Geological Society of Philadelphia and the Lyceum of Natural History of New York.
His extensive scientific work, besides the first identification of vanadium, included the discovery and description of various minerals and the invention of methods of extraction of minerals for use in the mining industry. After his death, the important mining district that includes Batopilas in Chihuahua was named in his honor.

The Chemical Society of Mexico instituted the prestigious National Chemistry Prize &quot;Andrés Manuel Del Río&quot; in 1964, with the object of giving public recognition to the work done by chemical professionals who have made extraordinary contributions to raise the level and prestige of the profession. It is awarded with a medal containing the likeness of del Río and a commemorative plaque. Andrés Manuel Del Río, Luis E. Miramontes, inventor of the first oral contraceptive, and Mario J. Molina, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995, are the three Mexican chemists of outstanding world significance. Miramontes won the &quot;Andrés Manuel Del Río&quot; Prize in 1986.

<text>Lida (, ; , ; ; ; , ; ) is a city in Grodno Region, western Belarus, located west of Minsk. It serves as the administrative center of Lida District. As of 2024, it has a population of 103,916.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Lida&quot; arises from its Lithuanian name &quot;Lyda&quot;, which derives from &quot;lydimas&quot;, meaning &quot;slash-and-burn&quot; agricultural method or a plot of land prepared in this way. Names in other languages are spelled as and .

== History ==
=== Early history, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ===

There are passing mentions of Lida in chronicles from 1180. Until the early 14th century, the settlement at Lida was a wooden fortress in Lithuania proper. In 1323, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas built a brick fortress there. The generally considered founding year of Lida is 1380. The fortress withstood Crusader attacks from Prussia in 1392 and 1394 but was burned to the ground in 1710. Following the death of Gediminas, when Lithuania was divided into principalities, Lida became the capital of one of them, the seat of Algirdas.

Lida was in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the Union of Krewo (1385), when the Polish–Lithuanian Union was established, and the subsequent Christianization of Lithuania, the Catholic parish was established in the former Lithuanian pagan lands, and a church, whose ruins still exist, was built by King Władysław II Jagiełło, who visited Lida two times, in 1415 and 1422. In the 15th century, the town became a centre of production by craftsmen and trade. Lida was connected with Vilnius, Navahrudak and Minsk. The town had a market square and four streets: Wileńska, Zamkowa, Kamieńska and Krivaya. In 1506, a Sejm was held in Lida, convened by King Aleksander Jagiellon and the Polish-Lithuanian army gathered here before the Battle of Kletsk, in which it defeated the invading Tatars.

In 1588, Lida became the seat of Lida District in Vilnius Voivodeship. Polish King Sigismund III Vasa granted Lida Magdeburg town rights in 1590, which were later confirmed in Warsaw by Kings Władysław IV Vasa in 1640 and Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki in 1670 and by the Polish Sejm in 1776. They let Lida hold two annual fairs of little import to the local economy. It was a royal city. The population was between 2000 and 5000 people.

The second half of the 17th century was a difficult time for Lida. During the Russo-Polish War the city was destroyed by the Cossacks in 1655 and the Russians in 1659. As a result of the war in 1656 famine occurred and in 1657 an epidemic. To revive Lida, King Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki exempted the city from taxes with a privilege of 1676. In 1679 it suffered a fire. In 1702, Lida was plundered by the Swedes.

In 1759, a high school was founded in Lida. By 1786, only 514 inhabitants were left in Lida, in 1792, 1243 people lived here. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, it was annexed by the Russian Empire as a powiat centre of the Slonim Governorate (1795).

=== Imperial Russia ===
Lida was then part of the Lithuania Governorate in 1797 and then Grodno Governorate in 1801.

The town was mostly destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars in 1812. In 1817, the population was 1366 people. In 1831, during the November Uprising, a battle was fought nearby between the Polish insurgents commanded by Dezydery Chłapowski and the Russians. After the uprising, as part of anti-Polish repressions the Piarist church was taken away from Catholics by the Russian administration and transformed into an Orthodox church. It was restored to Catholics after Poland regained independence. In 1842, Lida became the centre of Vilna Governorate. In 1863 and 1873, two beer factories were built in Lida. In 1884, the railway from Vilnius to Lunenets was finished. In 1907, the railway from Molodechno to Mosty was opened. In 1897, the town had 8626 people.

After a two-year school opened, so did a parish school with a department for girls and a Jewish school. In 1899, a hospital opened which consisted of 25 beds. In 1901, a cast-iron plant began to operate. In 1903, a sawmill started operating.

At the end of 19th century and the beginning of 20th century, two brick plants were built. In 1904, there were 1000 houses, of which 275 were brick, 14 small enterprises, four hospitals with beds for 115 patients and six elementary schools for 700 pupils. In 1904, the Russian Social Democratic Party was formed near Minsk. During the revolutions of 1905 to 1907, workers&#x27; uprisings took place, complete with political slogans. In 1914, there were almost 40 factories.

=== Interwar Poland ===

During World War I Lida was occupied by German troops. In 1919, the Red Army established Bolshevik power.

Polish troops, under General Józef Adam Lasocki, reached the outskirts of Lida in early March 1919. On April 15, they resumed their advance, and on April 17 they captured Lida, a screening operation to the taking of Vilnius. On 17 July 1920, the Red Army returned, but it was forced to retreat in August after their defeat at Warsaw.
On 30 September 1920, Polish and Russian troops fought in and around Lida during the Battle of the Niemen River, as the Soviet 21st Rifle Division tried to assault Polish positions but was repulsed by the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. The Poles took about 10,000 prisoners from the Soviet 3rd Army.

By the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920, Lida was ceded by the Soviets to Lithuania, but the treaty was not recognized by Poland. In accordance with 1921 Riga Peace Treaty, the town was awarded to Poland and was a powiat centre in the Nowogródek Voivodeship. According to the 1921 Polish census, the population was 65.8% Polish, 32.4% Jewish and 0.98% Belarusian.

In 1927 were 24 factories in Lida, whose production grew rapidly in 1928. A new rubber goods factory started, employing almost 800 people. Lida was also an important garrison of the Polish Army, with one infantry division and the 5th Corps of the Polish Air Force stationed there. In the 1930s, Lida was extensively expanded, dozens of new streets were built.

=== World War II and recent history ===

In 1939, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, Lida became part of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In January 1940, Lida became the centre of Lida Raion, in Baranavichy Region. From June 1941 to July 1944, it was occupied by German troops, who killed almost 25,149 people. On September 18, 1943, the Jewish Community of Lida was rounded up and taken to Majdanek, where they were murdered. Only about 200 Lida Jews survived the Holocaust. From mid-1944 Lida was occupied by the Soviets again. After the war, in 1945, in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement it was taken from Poland and annexed by the Soviet Union. Administratively, Lida became part of Grodno Region.

From the Cold War to 1993, Lida was home to the 1st Guards Bomber Aviation Division of the Soviet Air Force.

In the 2010s, Ivan Kulesh murdered a number of women in the city. He was later executed.

== Jewish Community ==

Jews first settled in Lida in the middle of the 16th century, and permission to construct a synagogue was granted by King Stefan Batory in 1579. The temple was decimated and rebuilt with the permission of King Wladyslaw Vasa in 1630, among the city&#x27;s notable rabbis at the time were Rabbi David ben Aryeh Leib and his son Pethahiah ben David. By 1817, the Jewish Community numbered 567, nearly three-quarters of the total population of the city. Lida had a particularly-sightly brick synagogue.
During the First World War, the German army captured Lida on 26 September 1915, and both Jews and Gentiles were forced into labour. Soon after the German Occupation ceased in winter 1918, Bolsheviks entered the city and created a strong sense of the Revolution. On 17 April 1919, Polish soldiers entered Lida and committed a pogrom, killing 39 Jews. Lida was captured by the Red Army on 17 July 1920 but was retaken by Polish troops on 29 September 1920. After the Peace of Riga, it was passed to Poland and became powiat (county) centre in Nowogródek Voivodeship.

The interwar period was a short period of economic growth for the Jewish community. All aspects flourished, and there were 12 fully functioning synagogues. In 1931, the Jewish population grew to 6,335, and at the dawn of the Holocaust, refugees increased the number to nearly 8,500. In the fall of 1939, the Red Army moved in and annexed Lida to the Baranavichy Region of Byelorussian SSR, part of the Soviet Union on 19 September 1939. Once again, the Jews were oppressed, and all cultural aspects of the community were diminished. The Soviets imprisoned surrounding Jews in Lida.

On 27 June 1941, the Germans severely damaged the city, and by December, a ghetto was created on the suburbs of Lida in which several families ended up crowding into a single home. On 7 May 1942, the ghetto was sealed, and the next day, nearly 6,000 were taken to a military firing range, where they were shot and piled in ready-made grave pits. About 1,500 educated Jews remained in the ghetto, and the population was added to by incoming refugees.

A few groups secretly escaped the city and hid in the forests until the city was liberated on 9 July 1944, but the rest of the community was murdered on 18 September 1943. It was passed to the new Grodno Region in 1944.

== Monuments and attractions ==

*Lida Castle was built by the order of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas for protection against assaults by the Teutonic Knights. The stone foundations were laid in 1323. Parts of the trapezium-shaped fortress were added on up through the 15th century. In the mid-17th century, an army of 30,000 was sent by Prince Nikita Khovansky of Moscow to destroy it, and in the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Swedes came and blew up the castle&#x27;s towers, permanently diminishing its military purpose. It has since been restored, and tourists come to view its crimson walls.
*The Roman Catholic Church of the Exaltation of the Cross, a fine example of local late Baroque architecture.
*The Piarist Church of St. Joseph in Lida was built in 1794 to 1825. Built in the Late Classicism Style, the round stone church has an attractive dome and front. In 1842, it was destroyed by a fire but was soon rebuilt. It is now an Eastern Orthodox Church.

<doc id="1267466" wikidata="Q7533240" url="?curid=1267466" title="Sixtoo">
<text>Sixtoo was the main project of Canadian underground hip hop DJ, producer and rapper Vaughn Robert Squire between 1996 and 2007. He has since retired the Sixtoo name, and is pursuing other directions in electronic music, with a large genre shift from experimental hip hop to deeper club sounds of various tempos. He has also released music as Speakerbruiser Rob, and Prison Garde.

==History==
Sixtoo rose to prominence in the mid-1990s underground hip hop scene, initially as half of Halifax, Nova Scotia hip hop duo Sebutones, along with Buck 65. During that time, he worked with Sage Francis, Moka Only, Mr. Dibbs and other members of Anticon.

In 2000, Sixtoo moved to Montreal where he signed on with UK-based record label Vertical Form. Soon after came the release of &quot;Antagonist Survival Kit&quot;, a synth-based sample album that showcased both sides of his skills: on the mic and on the sampler.

In 2003, Sixtoo signed to Ninja Tune. His debut album on the label, &quot;Chewing on Glass &amp; Other Miracle Cures&quot;, has won acclaim in the international electronic beats community in 2004.

Since silencing the Sixtoo project, he has had a string of visible live P.A. projects including Megasoid along with Hadji Bakara, a former member of Wolf Parade. He has also collaborated with Ango (born Andrew Gordon Macpherson) and Lunice (born Lunice Pierre Fermin) on the electronic music project Nouveau Palais. The trio released &quot;Avant Gang&quot; in 2012.

Sixtoo entirely produced Isaiah Toothtaker&#x27;s &quot;Sea Punk Funk&quot; in 2012.

<text>Walter David &quot;Wattie&quot; Buchan (born 24 July 1957) is a Scottish punk rock musician, best known as the lead vocalist for the Exploited.

==Early life==
Buchan was born in Edinburgh on 24 July 1957. He served in the British Army as a soldier prior to joining the Exploited. He became interested in punk rock in the 1970s after hearing music by bands such as Sex Pistols.

==Career==
The Exploited are a Scottish punk rock band from the second wave of UK punk, formed in 1978. Originally playing styles such as street punk and oi!, the band played styles such as crossover thrash later on. Formed in Edinburgh by Wattie&#x27;s younger brother Terry, they signed to Secret Records in March 1981 and released their debut EP &quot;Army Life&quot;. The album &quot;Punks Not Dead&quot; followed in the same year. Despite many lineup changes, the band continued into the 2000s, and has developed a worldwide following.

==Personal life==
Buchan is married to Gena Buchan.

===Health===
In February 2014, Buchan suffered a heart attack on stage in Lisbon, Portugal. The Exploited had been touring with Hatebreed and Napalm Death. He was admitted to S. José Hospital in Lisbon after the show and later moved to S. Marta Hospital to recover and undergo heart surgery. The Exploited cancelled the remaining of the Tour Of Chaos 2014 due to Buchan&#x27;s condition. On 29 June 2014, the Exploited&#x27;s Facebook page provided an update on Buchan&#x27;s condition, saying that after a successful heart operation, the band was practising new material.

In an interview with Rock Hard Magazine in May 2016, he said that he had suffered from depression, which was affecting his ability to write new lyrics.

===Views and beliefs===
Buchan openly hates politics. He also hates religion. When asked about religion, Buchan said, &quot;I fuckin&#x27; hate religion. For me everyone&#x27;s free to believe in something. Just because you believe in some of it, doesn&#x27;t mean that you…but I can&#x27;t understand people that care about religion more than anything else. I am like &#x27;What? What the fuck?!?&#x27; I just hate religion.&quot; Buchan is an anarchist. Buchan has condemned several politicians, including George W. Bush, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair. Buchan said about Thatcher: &quot;She was a bit of a cunt, but at least she was honest&quot;. The Exploited&#x27;s song &quot;Maggie&quot; is about Thatcher. In the song &quot;Maggie&quot; lyrics, Buchan calls Thatcher a &quot;cunt&quot;. Buchan has said that Blair &quot;is a total fucking, lying fanny wank.&quot; Buchan has criticized George W. Bush for the Iraq war that began in 2003. Buchan said: &quot;It&#x27;s unbelievable, these people have got so much power, and they start all these wars. Everybody sees that, but nobody does anything to stop that.&quot;

Buchan is pro-Palestine and has condemned Israel&#x27;s treatment of the Palestinians. In an interview with &quot;I Probably Hate Your Band&quot;, Buchan expressed his pro-Palestinian views, saying: &quot;even with Israel and Palestine, the Palestinian people are like prisoners and the world does nothing about it because America&#x27;s behind them, backing them because they want bases for their airplanes in that area.&quot; One of the songs The Exploited has worked on during the 2010s is a song called &quot;My TV&quot;, which Buchan says &quot;is about watching the news with Israel bombing Palestine and politicians being greedy cunts.&quot; Buchan has also criticized the foreign policy of both the United States and Britain. Buchan said: 

==Feuds and criticism towards other musicians==
Buchan is known for criticizing other musicians and starting feuds with other musicians. The Exploited&#x27;s &quot;Punks Not Dead&quot; album&#x27;s title is a reaction to anarcho punk contemporaries Crass&#x27; song &quot;Punk is Dead&quot;. Buchan has been open about disliking Crass, saying: &quot;People listen to bands and believe what they sing about. Crass was just words.&quot; He stated &quot;they were full of shit. They said they believed in this and that, but bought record companies under other people&#x27;s names so it couldn&#x27;t be traced back to them. It was all about money with them.&quot; Other than Crass, Buchan has criticized multiple other bands and musicians including Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra, Green Day, Bad Religion, Linkin Park, The Offspring, and Descendents. Buchan has also criticized the emo genre, saying &quot;Emo&#x27;s shit! They can stick it up their ass!&quot; Buchan accused the punk rock band the Buzzcocks of selling out. Buchan said about the Buzzcocks: &quot;They used to be good but they really sold out. A lot of the bands here used to be good until they turned to more pop rock. Like when I was a punk (when I was young), I used to see the Buzzcocks live. It was great.&quot; When the Exploited were at Amnesia Rockfest, Buchan, during an interview, criticized the other bands at the music festival, saying: &quot;Well, here at Rockfest, you got a lot of bands that define themselves as punk bands but they&#x27;re shit. They are so pop-oriented that they don&#x27;t even stand for any values; they do not deserve the status of being defined as punk bands.&quot;

Buchan has been known for openly disliking former Dead Kennedys member Jello Biafra. The Exploited&#x27;s song &quot;I Hate You&quot; is about Jello Biafra. On the album &quot;Live at the White House&quot;, he introduces the song with an insult to Biafra and claims that he slept with his wife. On the same album, he dedicates the song &quot;Wankers&quot; to the artist Pushead, who claimed that he was neither paid nor credited for his work with the band, and the song &quot;Daily News&quot; to &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot;. When asked in a documentary why he disliked Biafra, Buchan said that he could not remember. In May 2016, Buchan also criticised Slayer for refusing to allow the Exploited to appear on stage with them after the Exploited had allowed Slayer to cover [collaborating with Ice-T] three of their songs for the &quot;Judgment Night&quot; soundtrack for only a small payment. Buchan was asked which bands he liked after he criticised several other acts appearing at Amnesia Rockfest. Buchan responded by mentioning Charged GBH, Carcass, No Fun at All, Skinny Puppy, and Ministry. He also said of Slayer: &quot;Slayer&#x27;s okay. I mean, only some of their stuff is okay. I&#x27;ll restrain myself from saying anything more about them.&quot; Buchan said about Real McKenzies: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel any special political bond with them – my brother, the drummer of the band, is a lot more conscious of Scottish politics. However, I&#x27;ve played with them a few times; they&#x27;re total alcoholics. Good people: their gigs are always excitin&#x27;.&quot;

===Feud with Conflict===
After the appearance by the Exploited on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to perform &quot;Dead Cities&quot; in 1981, the hardcore punk band Conflict criticized the decision to appear on the programme with the song &quot;Exploitation&quot;. This began a long-standing feud between the Exploited and Conflict, which divided the punk community and caused occasional clashes between the bands&#x27; fans (known as &quot;The Barmy Army&quot; for the Exploited and &quot;the Conflict Crew&quot;).

===Feud with Green Day===
At an awards ceremony for a music magazine, Buchan was presenting an award that was won by Green Day, a band that Buchan hates. Buchan had to present the award to Green Day. Buchan alleged that during the after-party Green Day member Billie Joe Armstrong confronted him and said &quot;when you die, I&#x27;m going to be standing over your grave, laughing at ya.&quot; Buchan said he then responded to Armstrong, saying to Armstrong: &quot;I&#x27;ve got something you&#x27;ll never have, mate. You could have a big record company and loads of money but I&#x27;ve got something you&#x27;ll never have, and that&#x27;s respect from the punks. You can not buy that, you have to earn it.&quot; The two then had to be separated by onlookers.

<text>Anders Gustaf Ekeberg (16 January 1767 in Stockholm, Sweden – 11 February 1813 in Uppsala, Sweden) was a Swedish analytical chemist who discovered tantalum in 1802.
He was notably deaf.

==Education==
Anders Gustav Ekeberg was a Swedish scientist, mathematician and expert in Greek literature. 
His father, Joseph Erik Ekeberg, was a shipbuilder. His uncle was Carl Gustaf Ekeberg.

Anders Gustav Ekeberg attended school at Kalmar, Söderåkra, Vestervik, and Karlskrona. 
He was a gifted student and enrolled at Uppsala University in 1784, graduating in 1788. His thesis addressed the extraction of oils from seeds. In 1789 and 1790, he traveled and studied in Germany, hearing Martin Heinrich Klaproth lecture in Berlin as well as Christian Ehrenfried Weigel in Greifswald.

==Career==
In 1794, Anders Gustav Ekeberg began teaching at Uppsala. He was a supporter of Antoine Lavoisier&#x27;s proposals for systematizing chemical nomenclature. In 1795 he and Pehr von Afzelius published the first article to introduce the modern names for chemical elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen into the Swedish language, &quot;On the Present State of Chemical Sciences&quot;.

He was made docent in chemistry in 1794 and experimentator (&quot;laborator&quot;) in 1799, working as a demonstrator in the laboratory of Torbern Bergman. In 1798 he lectured on the theory of combustion.
In 1799, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Ekeberg had poor health throughout his life. During his childhood a severe cold had impaired his hearing, which was further weakened over the years, so that it hindered his teaching activities. Subsequently, a gas explosion blinded him in one eye.

Ekeberg was portrayed by his friends and students as a kind and gentle man. He died, unmarried, at the age of 46.

==Research==
Ekeberg analyzed a number of the minerals found at Ytterby and Falun. In 1802 he analyzed specimens of tantalite from Kimito, Finland, and of yttrotantalite from Ytterby, Sweden. He is credited with finding the element tantalum in both.

Ekeberg named the new element after the mythical Ancient Greek demigod Tantalus. According to legend, he was condemned to eternal frustration when he had to stand in water up to his neck, but the water receded as he attempted to drink.

==The Anders Gustaf Ekeberg Tantalum Prize==
In 2018 the Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center established The Anders Gustaf Ekeberg Tantalum Prize (&quot;Ekeberg Prize&quot;), an annual award to recognize excellence in tantalum research. The Prize will increase awareness of the many unique properties of tantalum products and the applications in which they excel. 
The inaugural winner of the Ekeberg Prize was Yuri Freeman, for his book &quot;Tantalum and Niobium-Based Capacitors&quot; (Springer, 2018).
