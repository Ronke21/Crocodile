<doc id="1296075" wikidata="Q1348785" url="?curid=1296075" title="Basuto Gun War">
<text>The Basuto Gun War, also known as the Basutoland Rebellion, was a conflict between the Basuto and the British Cape Colony. It lasted from 13 September 1880 to 29 April 1881 and ended in a Basuto victory.

Following Basutoland&#x27;s transformation into a British royal dominion on 12 March 1868, it became the target of rapid westernization efforts by the Cape Colony administration. In 1879, the Cape Parliament extended the Peace Preservation Act to Basutoland, with the aim of disarming the Basuto people. The immense significance of guns in Basuto society, compounded with past grievances, resulted in a rebellion led by chiefs Lerotholi and Masopha, which erupted on 13 September 1880. Heavily outnumbered and stretched thin by the simultaneous outbreak of other revolts, the Cape Colonial Forces failed to achieve a decisive military victory.

The ensuing military stalemate and the high cost of conducting the war in made it increasingly unpopular among Cape politicians. On 29 April 1881, High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Hercules Robinson announced the peaceful settlement of the conflict. The Cape&#x27;s subsequent efforts to enforce disarmament and re-establish the rule of law in Basutoland met with stiff resistance from Masopha and his supporters. Unable to control the Basuto, the Cape Parliament passed the Disannexation Act in September 1883. The Basuto Gun War represents a rare example of an African nation&#x27;s military victory against a colonial power, whereby the Basuto were able to retain their guns. Under the terms of the Disannexation Act, Basutoland was transformed into a British High Commission Territory, and thus not later incorporated into the Union of South Africa.

==Background==
During the early 19th century, a diverse group of Sotho-, Nguni- and Tswana-speaking tribes settled in the Caledon River region. The latter two, which formed the minority of the population, were gradually assimilated by the culturally dominant Sotho. King Moshoeshoe I united the various Sotho-speaking chieftainships into a single nation during a period of political turbulence known as &quot;Lifaqane&quot;. He transformed the denigratory exonym of Sotho into the name of the nascent Basuto nation. In 1833, missionaries from the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society began setting their outposts in Basuto lands following Moshoeshoe&#x27;s invitation. They promoted a combination of Christianity, Western civilization, and commerce. They saw Basuto customs linked to obligatory labor and the dependence of the population on their chiefs as evil. They sought to undermine them by promoting private property, the commodization of production and closer economic ties with European settlers.

In the 1820s, the Basuto faced cattle raids from the Koranna and first encountered horses and guns in a combat setting. They obtained horses and guns of their own, and began stockpiling gunpowder. By 1843, Moshoeshoe had accumulated more horses and guns than any other chieftain in South Africa, but the guns were outdated flintlocks, which had flooded the South African market after the introduction of percussion lock muskets. In 1852, the British signed the Sand River Convention with the Boers, banning the sale of guns to Africans, while continuing to trade between themselves under the terms of the 1854 Bloemfontein Convention. The Boer Orange Free State was able to procure modern breech-loading rifles and a small amount of artillery. The Basuto were forced to rely on smuggled and locally-produced gunpowder, which was of inferior quality.

In 1858, hostilities broke out between the Basuto and the Orange Free State. Inferior in both marksmanship and materiel, the Basuto suffered a series of defeats in wars that lasted until 1868. In 1866, the two sides signed the Treaty of Thaba Bosiu, whereby Moshoeshoe ceded most of his kingdom&#x27;s arable land to the Boers. Hostilities resumed soon afterwards, and the Boers began employing a scorched earth policy, leading to starvation among the Basuto. The Basuto appealed to British High Commissioner for Southern Africa Sir Philip Wodehouse and the Colony of Natal for protection. Although, initially reluctant to intervene, on 12 March 1868 Wodehouse proclaimed Basutoland to be a royal dominion.

The Basuto, who became part of the British Empire out of necessity, viewed any kind of colonial administration as &quot;a snake in the house&quot;. While the British, saw it as their responsibility to westernize their new subjects. Wodehouse therefore supported a gradual introduction of colonial laws, so as not to provoke backlash from the Basuto. Basutoland&#x27;s legal status remained unclear, with the Colonial Office at various times calling it a crown colony and a protectorate. Letsie I, who succeeded Moshoeshoe in 1870, viewed the annexation as merely a treaty of alliance and protection. Basuto chiefs therefore actively challenged the efforts of British authorities to enact major reforms without prior consultations. On 31 December 1870, Sir Henry Barkly was appointed as the new High Commissioner for Southern Africa. The British had long entertained the idea of incorporating Basutoland into the Cape Colony, and Barkly immediately pushed for annexation on the premise of the financial costs incurred by the colony&#x27;s policing of Basutoland. The bill confirming the annexation was approved by the Cape Parliament on 11 August 1871.

==Prelude==
===Morosi&#x27;s Revolt===
The Cape government immediately began to undermine the traditional power structures of the Basuto. Under the terms of the Mercantile Law of 1871, trade was restricted to those in possession of a government license. In 1872, it implemented the responsible government system, under which the governor&#x27;s legislative powers were transferred to the Cape Parliament. The Basuto were neither consulted nor formally informed. They were also barred from participating in the parliament unless they accepted to completely abandon their traditional laws and customs, a condition they deemed unacceptable. From that point on, Letsie I and the Governor&#x27;s Agent in Basutoland, Colonel Griffith, became embroiled in a power struggle. The Cape-appointed magistrates were given autonomy in enforcing colonial legislation as they saw fit. The magistrates interfered with land disputes, when the Basuto previously held exclusive rights on land allocation. Authority over marriage disputes and disputes between the Basuto and white residents were likewise transferred to magistrates&#x27; courts. Basuto prophetesses claimed to have communicated in their dreams with the spirit of Moshoeshoe, who had become increasingly angry with the white man&#x27;s interference in Basuto affairs.

The southern corner of Basutoland was settled by the Baphuthi people. Their chief Morosi was once a tributary ruler of Moshoeshoe who had reluctantly merged his territory with British Basutoland in 1869. In 1877, the colonial authorities created the Quthing District and appointed Hamilton Hope as the magistrate to oversee the Baputhi, a move opposed by Morosi. In April 1878, the colonial authorities dispatched 80 African policemen and 700 Basuto warriors to apprehend Morosi&#x27;s son Doda; the dispute was resolved peacefully. Hope was replaced by the more experienced John Austen, who was likewise distrusted by Morosi. Doda was finally imprisoned after being implicated in horse theft, his subsequent escape from captivity and Morosi&#x27;s refusal to hand him over impelled Cape Colony prime minister Sir Gordon Sprigg to authorize the forced disarmament of the Baphuthi. Austen ordered Letsie I to assist the Cape in the campaign, threatening to hand over parts of Quthing to white settlers and establish garrisons of colonial troops in Basutoland. Letsie I reluctantly agreed. The fighting lasted for several months, as the Baphuthi had entrenched themselves in the isolated Mount Moorosi. On 28 November 1879, the colonial troops managed to reach the summit with ladders, killing Morosi in the final confrontation. Morosi&#x27;s severed head was paraded in King William&#x27;s Town, an act that shocked Letsie I.

===Opposition to the Peace Preservation Act===
In 1878, the Cape Parliament had passed the Peace Preservation Act, which allowed for the confiscation of the firearms of the African population in exchange for a monetary compensation. Sprigg decided that its implementation should extend to the Basuto, after witnessing 7,000 Basuto cavalrymen perform maneuvers during the course of Morosi&#x27;s uprising. This was announced during a &quot;pitso&quot; (formal assembly) attended by some 6,000 to 10,000 Basuto. Soon afterwards he also declared that the Quthing region would be confiscated by the Cape for white settlement. At the time almost half of all Basuto men owned a firearm. Many had worked in railway construction and the diamond mines in Griqualand West with the express purpose of purchasing modern breech-loading and smoothbore rifles. As a result, the Basuto became the best-armed tribe in southern Africa. For the Basuto gun confiscation was unacceptable, not only due to their high value, but also due to the necessity to defend their land and cattle in an environment where there was no guarantee of protection from the colonial authorities. For the Basuto, guns were a symbol of manhood, and to be disarmed was seen as being reduced to the status of a child. In April 1879, the Cape Colony doubled the hut tax in Basutoland to one £ per hut.

In June 1880, Letsie I dispatched a three-man delegation to the Cape Parliament as it was deliberating the annexation of Quthing and the question of Basuto disarmament. The delegation argued that the annexation was a violation of prior agreements between Moshoeshoe and Wodehouse, while disarmament was unnecessary since the Basuto remained loyal to the Cape. The delegation was not allowed to present its case in the parliament. Petitions from the Basuto and their sympathizers from among the Paris Evangelical Society missionaries followed, all of which failed to produce a favorable result. Letsie I, now old and in declining health, was unwilling to lead an armed revolt, believing it to be futile. Cape Governor Sir Henry Bartle Frere became impatient at the deliberations and ordered Letsie I to enact disarmament immediately, even before the Basuto delegation had returned from Cape Town.

Few Basuto complied with the order and handed over their arms. This catalyzed the Cape Parliament to vote in favor of disarmament. The delegation announced their failure to prevent the enactment of the Peace Preservation Act at a &quot;pitso&quot; convened on 3 July. The heir to the Basuto throne, Lerotholi, spoke against disarmament, while Letsie&#x27;s brother chief Masopha and his nephew chief Joel Molapo openly challenged the order and advocated for armed resistance. Masopha began to fortify the stronghold of Thaba Bosiu, while the supporters of the rebel chiefs began ignoring orders from the local magistrates. White traders abandoned Basutoland, and Basuto loyalists fled to the magistracies for protection as armed bands roamed freely in the region.

Sprigg urged Letsie I to negotiate Masopha&#x27;s unconditional surrender, until a force of Cape Mounted Riflemen (CMR) could arrive to assist him. Letsie I replied that this was unrealistic, as most of the Basuto, including his sons, had rallied behind Masopha. Letsie and his armed retinue, returned to their village on 19 August after several days of negotiations, fearing that they would be ambushed if they remained outside Thaba Bosiu any longer. In a last ditch effort to prevent an uprising, Sprigg visited Letsie I in person. Letsie I then held another &quot;pitso&quot;—under Sprigg&#x27;s new terms the rebel chiefs were to appear in court where they would receive a token fine, pledge to compensate those whose property they had seized, and comply with the gun regulations. Masopha remained defiant and held an assembly of his own, where he and Lerotholi began to prepare for war. Masopha believed that the Cape&#x27;s troops had proved themselves to be incompetent during the suppression of Morosi&#x27;s revolt. He was further encouraged by rumors that the British would refuse to reinforce the Cape, and by the British defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana a year prior.

==Conflict==
===September 1880===

On 13 September 1880, a 212-man unit of Cape Mounted Riflemen under Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Carrington crossed into Basutoland in the vicinity of Wepener in order to reinforce the isolated magistracy at Mafeteng. Upon hearing of Carrington&#x27;s advance, the Mafeteng District magistrate Arthur Barkly set off with 20 policemen to scout ahead. Some from the magistracy, he encountered 300 Basuto warriors commanded by Lerotholi on a hill range overlooking the road. The two parleyed, and Barkly informed Lerotholi of the column&#x27;s imminent approach and advised him to surrender his arms and withdraw. Lerotholi refused and rode back to his men, after seeing the CMR appear on the rear of the police force. The Basuto then charged down from the hill, and a short skirmish ensued whereby the Basuto suffered light casualties. Carrington&#x27;s troops then garrisoned Mafeteng, where they were besieged by Lerotholi. On 17 September, a CMR unit was attacked by 700 Basuto outside Mafeteng. Following this attack Sprigg ordered the mobilization of the Cape&#x27;s armed forces.

The army mustered by the Cape government for the conflict, consisting entirely of Cape Colonial Forces troops, was commanded by Brigadier General Charles Clarke, who visited the frontlines only twice during the war, relegating his responsibilities to Adjutant General Major W. F. D. Cochrane and Carrington. Carrington was appointed as the Commandant of the Mafeteng Region and entrusted with a force of approximately 2,000 men. Its cavalry included 400 men from the Cape Mounted Riflemen, 600 men from the Cape Mounted Yeomanry (CMY), 200 riders from Kimberley Horse, as well as small units of scouts and African levies. Its infantry consisted of the Prince Alfred Volunteer Guards, Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Volunteer Guards and First City Volunteer Rifles, each numbering 100 to 200 soldiers. The force also included three RML 7-pounder mountain guns and two 5.5-inch mortars. A total of 3,000 white and 1,000 African troops were involved in the campaign.

The Basuto vastly outnumbered their adversaries, Lerotholi commanded 23,000 cavalry, of which 9,000 were concentrated in the Mafeteng District where most of the fighting took place. A part of the Basuto army was tasked with guarding Letsie&#x27;s ancestral village of Morija. Masopha blockaded the garrison of 200 CMR soldiers at Maseru. He burned Maseru&#x27;s main buildings in his first assault on the town, but further attacks proved less successful. In the north, Joel Molapo&#x27;s attack on Hlotse was likewise repulsed and he initiated a siege. The magistracies at Mohale&#x27;s Hoek and Quthing were abandoned by the Cape troops. The rebellion continued to spread across Basutoland, with clashes taking place across seven different fronts. The heavy casualties suffered by the Basuto during their frontal assaults caused them to increasingly adopt the tactics of the Boer Commando; employing ambushes and defending fortified positions. Their high mobility allowed them to engage their opponents only when they believed that conditions favored them and to quickly withdraw after firing. While the Basuto remained inferior marksmen in comparison to their opponents, the quality and the quantity of the arms at their disposal had increased considerably since the Boer wars.

===October 1880===
The outbreak of the Gun War (also known as Basutoland Rebellion) prompted other tribes to rise up in revolt. In Griqualand East, Charles Brownlee reported that the Basuto clans residing south of Drakensberg had been incited to revolt by the rebels in Basutoland on 4 October. Brownlee initially attempted to quell the uprising through negotiations, however this plan had to be abandoned when the learnt that the rebels were planning to assassinate him and the members of his administration. He then evacuated his district&#x27;s white population to Kokstad, while the rebels massacred members of the loyalist Hlubi and Bhaca tribes. Members of the Griqua and Mpondomise tribes rose up in the Qumbu and Tsolo Districts. The Qwati and some of the Thembu clans launched their own revolts in Thembuland. While Basuto incitement did play a role, the causes of those rebellions varied. Some tribes feared disarmament, others opposed the continuous erosion of traditional power structures, while others believed that merely by killing the local white population, colonial rule would disappear. The revolts in Transkei lasted until February 1881 and forced the already outnumbered Cape army to divert troops to other fronts.

Frere was recalled to Britain and Major General Henry Hugh Clifford, who had temporarily succeeded him, opposed both the war and Sprigg&#x27;s policies. Under the terms of the responsible government system, the Cape was responsible for its own internal security, with two British regiments being stationed in the region for the War Office&#x27;s own purposes. Clifford insisted that no British troops should be committed for the suppression of the rebellion. In October, Clarke arrived at Wepener at the head of a force of 1,000 cavalry, 600 infantry, five artillery pieces, and 40 wagons. Clarke was aiming to relieve Mafeteng, whose garrison was forced to exchange messages written in Greek, since some Basuto chiefs spoke both English and French. Clarke&#x27;s advance was slowed by deep mud, and the Basuto cavalry regularly harried the column with rifle fire before withdrawing. On 19 October, the Cape army reached Qalabane, an isolated kop halfway between Wepener and Mafeteng. Lerotholi had positioned 3,000 of his warriors behind a ridge that overlooked a nearby road. The advanced guard of the Cape Mounted Yeomanry came under rifle fire from the kop. Clarke ordered the artillery to fire upon the kop and dispatched 200 men from the 1st Cape Mounted Yeomanry to flank the kop from the left. CMY commander Captain Dalgety ordered his soldiers to dismount and assume an open order formation. Chief Seiso&#x27;s led a charge of 300 axe-wielding Basuto cavalrymen on Dalgety&#x27;s unit before the latter was able to reach the crest. The 2nd CMY reinforced Dalgety soon afterwards and captured a nearby village. The Cape army lost 32 killed and seven injured, while the Basuto lost 40 killed. The yeomanry was almost defenseless in hand-to-hand combat, as it was not yet issued bayonets or swords. The battle at Qalabane demoralized the Cape Mounted Yeomanry, which had previously successfully repulsed much larger bodies of enemy troops, but the Basuto hailed the clash as a great victory. Clarke reached Mafeteng, engaging in counter-insurgency operations in its vicinity until the end of the month before returning to the Cape.

===November 1880 – January 1881===

In November, Carrington destroyed villages adjacent to his line of communication and advanced towards Morija. In early December, he set up camp at Tsita&#x27;s Nek, engaging in multiple clashes with the Basuto on the road to Morija. On 14 January 1881, Colonel Brabant led a force of 380 cavalry, 180 infantry, 400 armed burghers, and two 7-pounder guns towards Thaba Tsueu. Brabant sent the burghers ahead to capture the Radiamari village. After burning Radiamari, the burghers disregarded their orders and pushed further into Sepechele village, which was held by 8,000 men under Lerotholi. Chief Maama charged the burghers with 3,000 of his warriors, and the latter began to withdraw towards the rest of the Cape force. The Basuto managed to close in on the burghers but were eventually beaten off with carbine and artillery fire. As Maama retired, Lerotholi&#x27;s warriors opened heavy fire from the surrounding ridges. Surgeon John Frederick McCrea of the 1st CMY won the Victoria Cross for attending injured burghers while being wounded himself. Brabant sent 140 riders from the Yeomanry in pursuit of Maama. The initial counter-attack failed after it was outflanked from the right. The Cape troops then dismounted and cleared the plateau and surrounding ridges. The Basuto suffered heavy casualties, while the Cape lost 16 killed and 21 wounded. Brabant then returned to his camp at Tsita&#x27;s Nek.

For most of the war the Cape&#x27;s troops and administration remained isolated in the Hlotse, Maseru, and Mafeteng Districts. The lack of offensive action reduced the Cape troops&#x27; morale still further. Letsie I officially remained loyal to the Cape, while tacitly supporting the rebellion by confiscating land from Basuto loyalists and accepting Austen&#x27;s severed head as a peace offering from Transkeian chief Tlokwa. According to Basuto oral tradition, Letsie I purposefully cultivated the image of a weak and unintelligent leader, while covertly communicating with the rebel leaders and encouraging the continuation of the rebellion. Basuto loyalist leaders like Jonathan Molapo surrendered their weapons on Letsie&#x27;s orders so as to maintain control of the country in case the rebels were defeated. During the course of the war, Griffith continued to believe in Letsie&#x27;s loyalty, blaming his inability to control his chiefs for the war.

In January the outbreak of the First Boer War put further pressure on the Cape&#x27;s already limited resources. By that time, the Cape war expenditure had reached £3 million. Fearing that Free State burghers might defect to the South African Republic, Cape authorities refused to allow new Boer volunteers to join the Basutoland campaign. The same month, the Basuto sued for peace with the assistance of opposition parliamentarian Jacobus Wilhelmus Sauer. As the maize harvest season neared, the Basuto began to fear that further fighting would lead to starvation in the following year. Under the terms put forward by the Basuto, they would retain their guns and autonomous rule. The deal was rejected by the Cape government, which demanded the surrender of all guns, the submission of the Basuto to Cape laws, and the leaders of the rebellion to stand trial with the guarantee that they would not be sentenced to death. Negotiations broke down, but the seven-day armistice allowed the Basuto to harvest their crops. The newly appointed High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Hercules Robinson, continued to insist on a peaceful settlement of the conflict.

===February–April 1881===
On 14 February Carrington captured Ramakhoatsi, which overlooked the main road to Morija. The following day, a force of 370 cavalry, 100 infantry, 50 native levies, and three artillery pieces under Brabant was sent out in search of a new camping ground. Upon crossing a spruit in the Ramibidikwa area, a CMR scout reported a massed formation of Basuto horsemen. Brabant ordered his soldiers to form a square; soon afterwards the Basuto commenced an attack on its front and two flanks. A combination of rifle and case shot fire kept the Basuto at bay in the center and the right flank. On the left, the Basuto managed to almost reach melee range before being likewise driven off. The artillery continued to fire on the retreating Basuto, who suffered 138 casualties in the engagement. One month later Clarke assumed personal command of the force, moving the camp to Ramibidikwa, from Morija. On 22 March, Carrington was heavily wounded in the vicinity of the new camp. 

By early April, Sprigg&#x27;s conduct of the war was being heavily criticized in the Cape Parliament, whose opposition members were pushing for a vote of no confidence. Using Letsie as an intermediary, Robinson organized a meeting between Griffith and Lerotholi outside Maseru on 17 April. The two sides signed an armistice, although Lerotholi was unwilling to surrender his weapons, as the motion would be too unpopular among his tribesmen. On 29 April, Robinson announced the peace settlement, known as the Award. Under its terms the Basuto would be allowed to keep their guns, provided they officially register them and pay an annual fee of one pound per weapon. The Cape pledged to provide an amnesty for the rebels and allow for Quthing to remain a part of Basutoland. The Basuto agreed to pay a collective fine of 5,000 cattle and compensate Basuto loyalists and white traders. The Award marked the end of the conflict. The Cape&#x27;s casualties during the war totaled 94 killed and 112 wounded.

==Aftermath==
===Opposition to the Award===
Basuto chiefs—including Lerotholi—welcomed the Award, and 3,000 heads of cattle were paid almost immediately as a gesture of goodwill. On 9 May 1881, Thomas Charles Scanlen replaced Sprigg as prime minister, while Basutophile Jacobus Wilhelmus Sauer was appointed as the new Secretary for Native Affairs. Scanlen encountered challenges in fully enforcing the Award, such as the erosion of the colonial administration&#x27;s prestige. Masopha demanded to be granted almost arbitrary power, refusing to pay his share of the hut tax and forbidding the return of the local magistrate. Joseph Orpen, who replaced Griffith, was seen as too sympathetic to the former rebels. His handling of cattle and land compensation led to the alienation of Basuto loyalists and the departure of nearly all pre-war magistrates from Basutoland. In January 1882, Letsie I assembled an army in order to enforce the Award on Masopha, yet the expedition was cancelled as it was judged that Masopha retained considerable popular support. The Colonial Office refused to allow the Cape to abandon Basutoland and cancel the Award. Robinson then set 15 March as the new deadline for the enforcement of the Award, threatening to confiscate land from the chiefs failing to abide to it and to redistribute Quthing District to white volunteers who fought in the war. Following pleas by Letsie I and Orpen, Robinson cancelled the Award on 15 March and pledged not to confiscate land. This was followed by the repeal of the Peace Preservation Act on 6 April.

The Basuto&#x27;s lack of cooperation gave rise to calls for Basutoland&#x27;s disannexation within the Cape Parliament. Eager to restore pre-war order, Scanlen invited Major General Charles George Gordon to Basutoland. Gordon had built a reputation as a capable administrator and an expert negotiator. He proposed replacing the magisterial system, granting the Basuto chiefs &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous rule. The proposal was rejected by John X. Merriman as unenforceable, citing the absence of unity among the Basuto. Merriman persuaded Gordon to stay in the Cape for an additional year. Sauer and Gordon then traveled to Basutoland in September 1882, Gordon was convinced that he could resolve the conflict if he were to enter negotiations with Masopha. On 16 September, Sauer held a private meeting with Letsie I and Lerotholi, and consented to the Basuto chiefs&#x27; proposal to assemble a force against Masopha. On 25 September, Gordon departed for a meeting with Masopha at Thaba Bosiu, at the same time Lerotholi had completed preparations to launch an assault on the stronghold. During his meeting with Masopha, Gordon disobeyed written instructions given to him by Sauer. Furthermore, Masopha intentionally prolonged the negotiations, thus thwarting Lerotholi&#x27;s assault on the mountain. Gordon departed Thaba Bosiu without having achieved his objective and resigned soon afterwards. Lerotholi felt humiliated by the incident, which developed into a long-lasting rivalry between him and his uncle.

===Disannexation===
In the northern Leribe District, rebel chief Joel Molapo and loyalist chief Jonathan Molapo continued to clash sporadically over the Leribe chieftaincy. Joel continuously attacked local loyalists in an effort to seize power, complicating the settlement of the Gun War. The fighting resulted in a wave of refugees fleeing towards the Orange Free State. A month later, a number of Basuto chiefs including Masopha, failed to appear at a &quot;pitso&quot; called by Orpen&#x27;s successor Matt Blyth, thus rejecting Scanlen&#x27;s new proposal for semi-autonomous rule. Aided by Masopha, Joel Molapo continued to massacre and destroy the properties of his opponents. During one of his raids, his warriors burnt the stone house of his deceased father, which shifted popular opinion against him. In May, Letsie I officially granted Jonathan the Leribe chieftaincy, but despite Letsie&#x27;s declaration, violence in Leribe did not subside until the end of the year. Facing continued diplomatic protests from the Free State and unable to enforce the law in Basutoland, the Cape Parliament passed the Disannexation Act in September 1883.

A &quot;pitso&quot; held at Maseru on 29 November resulted in most chiefs voting in favor of remaining British subjects. Masopha did not attend the Maseru &quot;pitso&quot;, holding one of his own; where he demanded complete independence. The British Secretary of State issued an Order-in-Council granting the queen&#x27;s support to the Disannexation Act, which came into force on 18 March 1884. Under its terms the newly created High Commission Territory of Basutoland was to be indirectly ruled by the Basutoland High Commissioner Marshal Clarke. The Basuto retained their guns, prevented the alienation of their land to white settlement and thwarted the absorption of their country by the Free State, which would have inevitably occurred had they gained complete independence. The Basuto chiefs retained most of their past authority, while unrest in Masopha&#x27;s district was only brought to an end after his defeat in the 1898 Basuto Civil War. The Basuto Gun War represents a rare example of an African nation&#x27;s military victory against a colonial power in the 19th century. Its status as a High Commission Territory meant that Basutoland was not incorporated into the Union of South Africa in 1910.

<text>Cam Lyman (born Camilla Lowell Lyman; September 4, 1932 – ) was a multimillionaire breeder of champion Clumber spaniels and Bernese mountain dogs, who notably died under mysterious circumstances. Lyman&#x27;s father was Arthur T. Lyman, a prominent Bostonian and scion of the wealthy Lyman family who made their money in the China trade and later in cotton mills and the cotton trade.

Lyman was a trans man. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that, as a middle-aged adult, Lyman was &quot;known to acquaintances as a man&quot; and cultivated &quot;a male identity&quot;. He disappeared in 1987 and was declared dead in 1995.

==Biography==

Lyman bred and trained Clumber spaniels and Bernese mountain dogs, and was well known for being talented but rather reclusive. After the death of his father from lung cancer in 1968, Lyman began to withdraw from his remaining family, moving from the family estate &quot;Ricefields&quot; on Thacher Street in Westwood, Massachusetts, to a home in Rhode Island, wearing men&#x27;s clothing, and reportedly taking steroids prescribed for his dogs to grow a mustache, as well as wearing his hair in a traditionally masculine hairstyle. By 1985, he had the typical appearance of a male (according to some, he looked startlingly similar to his deceased father by this time) and went by the name Cam. It was during this time that Lyman began to associate with a man named George O&#x27;Neil. O&#x27;Neil became caretaker of Lyman&#x27;s estate, and fed, showed, and took care of his dogs.

In 1987, Lyman&#x27;s relatives failed to receive the customary Christmas card from him. They investigated his disappearance and discovered that no one had seen or heard from Lyman in months. Police questioned O&#x27;Neil, who claimed that in the summer of 1987, he and Lyman had a fight over the phone about the dogs, and Lyman hung up on him. The next day, O&#x27;Neil went over to Lyman&#x27;s house and found the phone ripped out of the wall and the doors wide open. O&#x27;Neil claimed that he believed Lyman had gone to Europe to undergo sexual reassignment surgery. However, O&#x27;Neil failed to provide police any proof that Lyman had gone to Europe. O&#x27;Neil also failed to explain why he had not informed anyone of Lyman&#x27;s disappearance for nearly six months.

On September 24, 1997, Lyman&#x27;s body was found in a septic tank on his estate in Hopkinton, Rhode Island, by owners who had recently purchased the house. His final will named the American Kennel Club&#x27;s Museum of the Dog as the sole beneficiary. The story was featured on &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, but as of 2011, no one has ever been charged in the case.

In 2003, George O&#x27;Neil was indicted for embezzling $15,000 from Lyman&#x27;s estate. O&#x27;Neil was sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to pay $450 in court costs. He died in 2011 without giving any more information on Cam Lyman&#x27;s death.

<doc id="1296085" wikidata="Q2528011" url="?curid=1296085" title="Virtual finite-state machine">
<text>A virtual finite-state machine (VFSM) is a finite-state machine (FSM) defined in a virtual environment. The VFSM concept provides a software specification method to describe the behaviour of a control system using assigned names of input control properties and output actions.

The VFSM method introduces an execution model and facilitates the idea of an executable specification. This technology is mainly used in complex machine control, instrumentation, and telecommunication applications.

== Why ==
Implementing a state machine necessitates the generation of logical conditions (state transition conditions and action conditions). In the hardware environment, where state machines found their original use, this is trivial: all signals are Boolean. In contrast state machines specified and implemented in software require logical conditions that are per se multivalued:
* Temperature could be Low, OK, High
* Commands may have several values: Init, Start, Stop, Break, Continue
* In a hierarchical control system the subordinate state machines can have many states that are used as conditions of the superior state machine

In addition input signals can be unknown due to errors or malfunctions, meaning even digital input signals (considered as classical Boolean values) are in fact 3 values: Low, High, Unknown.

A Positive Logical Algebra solves this problem via virtualization, by creating a Virtual Environment which allows specification of state machines for software using multivalued variables.

== Control properties ==
A state variable in the VFSM environment may have one or more values which are relevant for the Control—in such a case it is an input variable. Those values are the control properties of this variable. Control properties are not necessarily specific data values but are rather certain states of the variable. For instance, a digital variable could provide three control properties: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN according to its possible boolean values. A numerical (analog) input variable has control properties such as: LOW, HIGH, OK, BAD, UNKNOWN according to its range of desired values. A timer can have its OVER state (time-out occurred) as its most significant control value; other values could be STOPPED or RUNNING.

== Actions ==
Other state variables in the VFSM environment may be activated by actions—in such a case it is an output variable. For instance, a digital output has two actions: True and False. A numerical (analog) output variable has an action: Set. A timer which is both: an input and output variable can be triggered by actions like: Start, Stop or Reset.

== Virtual environment ==

The virtual environment characterises the runtime environment in which a virtual machine operates. It is defined by three sets of names:
*input names represent the control properties of all available variables
*output names represent the available actions on the variables
*state names, as defined for each of the states of the FSM.
The input names build virtual conditions to perform state transitions or input actions. The virtual conditions are built using the positive logic algebra. The output names trigger actions; entry actions, exit actions, input actions or transition actions.

== Positive logic algebra ==
The rules to build a virtual condition are as follows:

=== Input names and virtual input ===
A state of an input is described by Input Names which create a set:
* input A: codice_1
* input B: codice_2
* input C: codice_3
etc.

Virtual input codice_4 is a set of mutually exclusive elements of input names. A codice_4 always contains the element codice_6:
 VI = {&quot;always&quot;}
 VI = {&quot;always&quot;, &quot;A1&quot;}
 VI = {&quot;always&quot;, &quot;A1&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;, &quot;C4&quot;}

=== Logical operations on input names ===
codice_7 (AND) operation is a set of input names:

&quot;A1&quot; &amp; &quot;B3&quot; &amp; &quot;C2&quot; =&gt; codice_8
codice_9 (OR) operation is a table of sets of input names:

&quot;A1&quot; | &quot;B3&quot; | &quot;C2&quot; =&gt; formula_1

codice_10 (Complement) is a complement of a set of input names:

~&quot;A2&quot; = codice_11

=== Logical expression ===
A logical expression is an OR-table of AND-sets (a disjunctive normal form):

&quot;A1&quot; &amp; &quot;B3&quot; | &quot;A1&quot; &amp; &quot;B2&quot; &amp; &quot;C4&quot; | &quot;C2&quot; =&gt; formula_2

Logical expressions are used to express any logical function.

=== Evaluation of a logical expression ===
The logical value (true, false) of a logical expression is calculated by testing whether any of the AND-sets in the OR-table is a subset of codice_4.

=== Output names and virtual output ===
A state of an output is described by Output Names which create a set:
* output X: codice_13
* output Y: codice_14
Virtual output codice_15 is a set of mutually exclusive elements of output names.

=== Virtual environment===
The Virtual Name and Virtual Output completed by State Names create the Virtual Environment codice_16 where the behaviour is specified.

== VFSM execution model ==

A subset of all defined input names, which can exist only in a certain situation, is called virtual input or codice_4. For instance temperature can be either &quot;too low&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;too high&quot;. Although there are three input names defined, only one of them can exist in a real situation. This one builds the codice_4.

A subset of all defined output names, which can exist only in a certain situation is called virtual output or codice_15. This is built by the current action(s) of the VFSM.

The behavior specification is built by a state table which describes all details of all states of the VFSM.

The VFSM executor is triggered by codice_4 and the current state of the VFSM. In consideration of the behavior specification of the current state, the codice_15 is set.

Figure 2 shows one possible implementation of a VFSM executor. Based on this implementation a typical behavior characteristics must be considered.

== State table ==

A &quot;state table&quot; defines all details of the behavior of a state of a VFSM. It consists of three columns; the first column names the state, the second lists virtual conditions built out of input names using the positive logic algebra, and the third column contains the output names:

Read the table as following: the first two lines define the entry and exit actions of the current state. The following lines which do not provide the next state represent the input actions. Finally the lines providing the next state represent the state transition conditions and transition actions. All fields are optional. A pure combinatorial VFSM is possible in cases only where input actions are used, but no state transitions are defined. The transition action can be replaced by the proper use of other actions.

<text>Nicholas F. Oppenheimer (born 8 June 1945) is a South African billionaire businessman. He was formerly the chairman of De Beers diamond mining company and of its subsidiary, the Diamond Trading Company, and former deputy chairman of Anglo American. He is the third richest man in Africa with an estimated net worth of US$12.3 Billion as of 2025 according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

==Early life==
Born on 8 June 1945 in Johannesburg, Oppenheimer is the son of Bridget (née McCall) and Harry Oppenheimer, and grandson of Anglo American founder Ernest Oppenheimer (the first generation to chair De Beers, from 1929). His father was of German Jewish descent. He was educated at Ludgrove School, Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, earning an Oxford MA.

==Business career==
Oppenheimer joined Anglo American in 1968, was appointed a director in 1974, then became deputy chairman in 1983. He resigned in 2001, remaining a non-executive director until 2011.

He was appointed deputy chairman of the then Central Selling Organisation (now Diamond Trading Company) in 1984, and deputy chairman of De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1985. He was also appointed chairman of the Diamond Trading Company in 1985. Chairman of the De Beers Group from 1998 to 2012, he retired when the family stake was sold to Anglo American.

Oppenheimer appeared on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2018 as the 23rd richest person in the United Kingdom, with a reported fortune of £5.5 billion. He was ranked as the richest person in South Africa on &quot;Forbes&quot; list of The World&#x27;s Billionaires for 2019, with a fortune reported as US$7.3 billion and, again, on its 2020 list, with a reported fortune of US$7.6 billion in August 2020.

==Philanthropy==
The Oppenheimer family has directed much of its philanthropic efforts towards preserving the heritage and cultural importance of the Southern African region, as well as to broader community upliftment in the areas of education, health, nature conservation and the arts. Nicky Oppenheimer and his son Jonathan Oppenheimer established the Brenthurst Foundation in 2005 as a way to contribute to the debate around strategies and policies for strengthening Africa&#x27;s economic performance and enabling inclusive and sustainable development.

The family has also long been involved in environmental and conservation issues. The Oppenheimer family partnered with De Beers to establish the Diamond Route in 2006 to maximise the potential of their properties for conservation, research and environmental awareness purposes. The Diamond Route links 8 sites across northern South Africa, stretching from Namaqualand on the west coast, to Kimberley, north to Tswalu in the Kalahari, and to the Brenthurst Gardens in Johannesburg, eastwards to Ezemvelo Nature Reserve and northwards to the Venetia Limpopo Nature Reserve in Limpopo Province. Since 2015 Oppenheimer is also a Rhodes Trustee.

==Awards==
In 2003, the Technikon Witwatersrand awarded Oppenheimer an honorary doctorate. He received the Presidential Order of Honour (2004) from the former President of Botswana, Festus Mogae, and an honorary fellowship (2009) from the London Business School.

==Personal life==
In 1968, he married Orcillia &quot;Strilli&quot; Lasch, daughter of industrial tycoon Helli Lasch; both are Anglican. His father was born Jewish and converted to Anglicanism.

<text>Armenian rock describes a wide variety of forms of rock music made in Armenia or by artists of Armenian descent.

Among the most recognized groups of Soviet era were Arthur Meschian&#x27;s &quot;Arakyalner&quot;, &quot;1+2&quot;, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, and &quot;Bliki&quot;. Following the loosening of state control in the early 1980s, a number of Armenian rock bands gained followers in Western Europe, such as Asparez and Ayas. Asparez was the only Armenian rock act to release an LP on the iconic Soviet label Melodiya. The bands Tarerk, Tessilk, 36.6 and Maximum had strong followings at home.

==History==

===Soviet Era===
Rock was greatly restricted for most of the period Armenia was under Soviet rule, being viewed by the CPSU as a Western anti-socialist influence. Yet, by the early 1970s, there were a range of popular bands in the capital city of Yerevan strong enough to compete with their Soviet counterparts - Arthur Meschian&#x27;s &quot;Arakyalner&quot;, &quot;1+2&quot;, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; and &quot;Bliki&quot;.

By the eighties, combining Armenian folk music with rock, the Armenian folk-rock groups were founded with notable, and popular even in 2000&#x27;s, representatives - Bambir, founded 1978 in Leninakan and Vostan Hayots, founded in 1986 in Yerevan. In 1982 Bambir won the &quot;Folk Music Award&quot; at the International Festival in Lida, Belarus. Other more obscure groups were also founded in the same time period like Zartong a short-lived Armenian folk group from France.

As the Soviet rock scene grew larger in the late 1980s, bands like Asparez and Ayas attracted international audiences due to the new popularity of oriental rock these two bands were among original contributors, that was described first time in Melodie und Rhythmus magazine. Ayas was formed in 1986 by a conservatory graduate Artur Mitinyan, and a year later won &quot;Best Song of the Year&quot; award at Yerevan&#x27;s &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock Festival&quot;. Later they won the &quot;Sisian Rock Festival&quot; award as well. Elips was another important band of the era formed in 1986. In summer 1986 “Elips” went on tour to Latvia, where they played together with a Riga-based group “Pilligrim”. Simultaneously with the fame, the group gained the hatred of the Soviet Communist party nomenclature and was prohibited as an anti-Soviet group. Their most popular song - &quot;Patkeratsrek&quot; (Imagine) remains as one of the hymns of Armenian rock.

===Post-Soviet Era===
In the early 1990s, an Armenian progressive rock scene developed. Dumbarton Oaks was one of the first bands trying to combine rock with classical music, an example of this is &quot;Once Upon a Time There Lived a Cadence&quot;. The psychedelic side of prog-rock was represented in the much heavier works of MDP. Though only in the 2000s Artsruni and Oaksenham released their albums with the leading French label, Musea, being the pioneers among local bands releasing albums beyond sentimental market. Both bands boast presence of their albums on iTunes and Allmusic.com. Other popular Armenian rock bands of this era included &quot;Breeze&quot;, Ambehr, &quot;The Kings&#x27; Cross&quot;, &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, &quot;IF&quot; by Hayk F. Gyolchanyan, Lav Eli and Empyray. Beerdingungs Lauten was the only representative of grindcore style. Former &quot;Lav Eli&quot; guitarist Gor Mkhitarian is currently involved with the folk rock scene in the United States regularly releasing his albums there.

A notable example is Deti Picaso a Russia-based folk prog-band consisted of mostly Armenians was noticed and appreciated in Armenia and revived interest towards folk music. 

In the same early 1990s the Armenian rock bands got to have a fanzine - &quot;Mark&#x27;s Gazette&quot;,
self-published by Arman Padaryan (aka Mark) for the next 10 years.

===Expatriate Armenian rock===
Expatriate Armenian rock musicians in the US during the 1990s were few, with fewer venues for them to perform. Tigran Mousoian, president of The Armenian Musicians &amp; Artists Center, had organized two festivals in Yerevan, and then planned Armenian Rock Festival in Glendale, California.

==Audience in Armenia==
The audience in Armenia remains exceedingly small for local rock groups, playing in local clubs in Yerevan and Gyumri. Although &quot;SARD&quot;, &quot;Bambir 2&quot;, &quot;Vordan Karmir&quot;, &quot;Reincarnation&quot; and speed-metal band Aramazd started to receive media attention, especially after their videos were televised nationally. &quot;Roxygeen&quot; was heading the scene of cover-bands, while STRYFE and Sworn are prog-metal bands. The revived MDP and Oaksenham in addition to Bambir 2, Blood Covenant, STRYFE, Sworn and Empyray led the vanguard of quality made native rock in the new millennium.
Arthur Meschian had sold-out concerts in Yerevan Opera Theatre and Complex Sports and Concerts Complex.
Also the most popular alternative rock band in the world from Armenia is The Beautified Project. The band has played concerts in Armenia, UK, Austria, Germany, France, Russia and Georgia.

==Music awards==
Since 2004 International Armenian Music Award announces winners in various rock categories. Among laureates and nominees there were Bambir 2, Empyray, Oaksenham, Hexen, Gor Mkhitaryan, Red Snow and others. In 2009 Lebanese Armenian, Eileen Khatchadourian&#x27;s album &quot;Midan&quot; received the award of the Best Rock Album of the year. 
Another ceremony is Armenia&#x27;s National Music Awards showcase of the Armenian Television 1st Channel, which claims best performers of the year in Armenia. At the 6th ceremony, which took place on March 27, 2010, the best rock group was announced Dorians, a group featuring a singer Gor Sujyan.

Unfortunately both awards has not gained authority, and are often boycotted by more intransigent Armenian rock musicians.

==Rock festivals==
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, festivals organized by the ACCEA (Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art) signaled a rebirth of the Armenian rock music scene, with many new bands and musicians coming from the heartland region of Vanadzor. Among the most popular bands at that time there were &quot;Vostan Hayots&quot;, &quot;Angels&quot;, and punk rockers &quot;Ass Kissers&quot;. There was a splash of interest in very heavy acts such as &quot;Beerdigungs Läuten&quot; playing quality grindcore metal.

In September 2007 Rock4Peace festival concerts organized with participation of Germans from Kultur Aktiv e.V. and Vibrographus were held in Yerevan, Gyumri and Stepanakert.
The reunion of Ayas took place after the meeting of the band&#x27;s core musicians in Moscow,
whilst Vostan Hayots continued irregularly appear with club concerts in Yerevan. Armenian rock started to live another wave of revival and yet local rock music does not have an industrial sense, though Armenian rock musicians started to participate in the commercially and politically biased projects such as two &quot;Rock-and-Dram&quot; festivals were held, on April 13 and November 23, 2007.

Tigran Mousoian, president of The Armenian Musicians &amp; Artists Center, organized two festivals in Yerevan, and planned Armenian Rock Festival in Glendale, California.

==Concerts by outside groups==
A range of top-class concerts featuring legendary rock groups has been organized in Armenia by Vibrgraphus in 2009 and 2010 including visits of Jethro Tull, Uriah Heep, John McLaughlin and Deep Purple.

==Other activity==
Harutyun Ayvazyan (Artyom) was the first Armenian journalist, who published a rock encyclopedia in St. Petersburg in Russian language at Avgust Publishing House. The rock group Vara features an Armenian lead singer.

<text>Rada is the term for &quot;parliament&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot; or some other &quot;council&quot; in several Slavic languages. Normally it is translated as &quot;council&quot;. Sometimes it corresponds to &quot;parliament&quot;, or in Soviet Union contexts, to &quot;soviet&quot;. It also carries a meaning of advice, as in the English word &quot;counsel&quot;.

== Etymology ==

Old High German &quot;rāt&quot; (from Proto-Germanic &quot;*rēdaz&quot;) passed (possibly through Polish) into the Czech, Slovak, Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages. Although some researches like K. P. Stanley et al. argued that contrary to the above stated hypothesis that the Germanic languages borrowed the words for council and related terms from Slavic languages.

Alternately the source was the Gothic language &quot;radan - 𐍂𐌰𐌳𐌰𐌽&quot; - to council, to deliberate, that passed to West Slavic in the Iron Age during the Wielbark and Chernyakhov cultures presence along Vistula river and in Western Ukraine, as the term &quot;rada&quot; may be present in such first millennium CE names as Slavic Radogoszcz, Radgoszcz, Radhošť, Radegost, Radagast, Ardagast - Radogost, and Gothic Radagaisus. The dispersal to East Slavic Languages, could have happened later, possibly through Polish.

&quot;Råd&quot; in Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, &quot;Rat&quot; in German, &quot;neuvosto&quot; or &quot;raati&quot; in Finnish and &quot;nõukogu&quot; or &quot;raad&quot; in Estonia/Dutch mean &quot;council&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot;, but also &quot;advice&quot;, as it does in East Slavic (except Russian) and West Slavic, but not South Slavic, languages.

In Swedish the verb &quot;råda&quot; (to counsel) is based on the substantive &quot;råd&quot;. This is similar to Danish &quot;råd&quot; (noun) and &quot;råde&quot; (verb).

<text>The Sich Council (, &quot;Sichova Rada&quot;) was the highest branch of government of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, and based at their center, the Zaporizhian Sich. It was also called Viyskova Rada (Military Council). The Rada, a type of governing committee but with participation from the cossack members, was involved in legislative, executive and judicial matters.

==Functions==

As an institution, the Sich Rada was a form of direct democracy where rights of individual cossacks were preserved through participation in the Rada.

It was able to decide when to go to war and when to conclude a peace treaty. It elected the officer staff (starshyna), with the Kosh otaman at its head. It received foreign diplomats and determined the course of diplomatic relations.

The Sich Rada also fulfilled certain economic functions, such as the distribution of the communal agricultural and fishing districts among the kurins of the Sich.

<text>The &#x27; or &#x27; (Latin, &#x27;Secret of secrets&#x27;), also known as the (), is a treatise which purports to be a letter from Aristotle to his student Alexander the Great on an encyclopedic range of topics, including statecraft, ethics, physiognomy, astrology, alchemy, magic, and medicine. The earliest extant editions claim to be based on a 9th-century Arabic translation of a Syriac translation of the lost Greek original. It is a pseudo-Aristotelian work. Modern scholarship finds it likely to have been written in the 10th century in Arabic. Translated into Latin in the mid-12th century, it was influential among European intellectuals during the High Middle Ages.

==Origin==
The origin of the treatise remains uncertain. The Arabic edition claims to be a translation from Greek by 9th-century scholar Abu Yahya ibn al-Batriq (died 806 CE), and one of the main translators of Greek-language philosophical works for al-Ma&#x27;mun, working from a Syriac edition which was itself translated from a Greek original. It contains supposed letters from Aristotle to his pupil Alexander the Great. No such texts have been discovered and it appears the work was actually composed in Arabic. The letters may thus derive from the Islamic and Persian legends surrounding Alexander. The Arabic treatise is preserved in two versions: a longer 10-book version and a shorter version of 7 or 8 books, the latter is preserved in about 50 copies.

Modern scholarship considers that the text must date to after the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot; and before the work of Ibn Juljul in the late 10th century. The section on physiognomy may have been circulating as early as AD 940. The Arabic version was translated into Persian (at least twice), Ottoman Turkish (twice), Hebrew, Spanish, and twice into Latin. (The Hebrew edition was also the basis for a translation into Russian.) The first Latin translation of a part of the work was made for the Portuguese queen by the &quot;converso&quot; John of Seville; it is now preserved in about 150 copies under the title &quot;Epistola Aristotelis ad Alexandrum de regimine sanitatis&quot; (&quot;Aristotle&#x27;s letter to Alexander on good health&quot;). The second translation, this time of the whole work, was done at Antioch by the canon Philip of Tripoli for Bishop Guy of Tripoli; it is preserved in more than 350 copies. Some 13th-century editions include additional sections.

==Contents==
The &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot; claims to be a treatise written by Aristotle to Alexander during his conquest of Achaemenid Persia. Its topics range from ethical questions that face a ruler to astrology to the medical and magical properties of plants, gems, and numbers to an account of a unified science that is accessible only to a scholar with the proper moral and intellectual background. Copland&#x27;s English translation is divided into sections on the work&#x27;s introduction, the Manner of Kings, Health, the Four Seasons of the Year, Natural Heat, Food, Justice, Physiognomy, and Comportment.

The enlarged 13th-century edition includes alchemical references and an early version of the Emerald Tablet.

==Legacy==
It was one of the most widely read texts of the High Middle Ages or even &quot;the&quot; most-read. Amid the 12th-century Renaissance&#x27;s Recovery of Aristotle, medieval readers took the ascription to Aristotle at face value and treated this work among Aristotle&#x27;s genuine works. It is particularly connected with the 13th-century English scholar Roger Bacon, who cited it more often than his contemporaries and even produced an edited manuscript with his own introduction and notes, an unusual honor. This led mid-20th century scholars like Steele to claim that Bacon&#x27;s contact with the &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot; was the key event pushing him towards experimental science; more recent scholarship is less sweeping in its claims but still accords it an important place in the research of his later works.

The Latin &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot; was eventually translated into Czech, Russian, Croatian, Dutch, German, Icelandic, English, Aragonese, Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, and Welsh. The 1528 English translation by Robert Copland was based on Philip of Tripoli&#x27;s Latin edition.

Scholarly attention to the &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot; waned around 1550 but lay interest has continued to this day among students of the occult. Scholars today see it as a window onto medieval intellectual life: it was used in a variety of scholarly contexts and had some part to play in the scholarly controversies of the day.

<doc id="1296129" wikidata="Q7182619" url="?curid=1296129" title="Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists">
<text>The Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists (PABJ) is an organization formed in June 1974 to advocate for a fair representation of Black journalists in the city’s mainstream media. It was composed of journalists and television and radio stations.

== Formation ==
Black journalists formed the Association of Black Journalists (ABJ), as it was originally named, several months before publicizing its existence in a press release in October 1974. A spokesman told the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; that it was founded in June 1974 and its stated purpose was to “encourage more Blacks to enter the media, sensitize the white media for more balanced coverage of Black events and develop closer ties with other Black professional groups.”

The organization had identified 76 Black newspeople in the Greater Philadelphia area, and it had about 50 members. ABJ met monthly at the Institute of Black Ministries in North Philadelphia.

The press release named the officers and executive board:

* Chuck Stone (&quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;), president
* Pam Haynes (&quot;Philadelphia Tribune&quot;), vice president
* Sam Pressley (&quot;Philadelphia Evening Bulletin&quot;), secretary
* George Strait (WPVI-TV), treasurer
* James C. Johnson (&quot;Philadelphia Evening Bulletin&quot;), assistant treasurer

The Executive Board:

* Claude Lewis (&quot;Philadelphia Evening Bulletin&quot;), chairman of the Executive Board
* Francine Cheeks (WCAU-TV)
* Joe Donovan (KYW radio)
* Artis Hall (WCAU-TV)
* Carole Norris (WHYY-TV)

On December 15, 1975, member J. Whyatt “Jerry” Mondesire of the Philadelphia Inquirer filed Articles of Incorporation papers for the ABJ as a non-profit, three days after the founding of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). The request was approved by the state of Pennsylvania in January 1976. The document changed its name to the Association of Black Journalists of Philadelphia.

Its early membership was restricted to working journalists, photographers and students, and was eventually expanded to include media professionals. Prior to the founding of the ABJ, an organization of media professionals was organized as Black Communicators Inc. in 1971.

== NABJ ==
Several PABJ members were among the 44 Black journalists from across the country who met in Washington, DC, to form NABJ on December 12, 1975. They included Reginald &quot;Reggie&quot; Bryant, Chuck Stone, Acel Moore, Claude Lewis, Joe Davidson, Sandra Dawson (Long Weaver). Stone was elected president, and he served a dual presidency of both the NABJ and ABJ. In a news story in 1995, Stone described the NABJ as a “direct descendant” of ABJ and ABJ’s constitution and bylaws as a model for the NABJ’s.

Three of PABJ’s 25 presidents have become presidents of NABJ: Stone, Vanessa Williams and Sarah Glover.

== First project ==
ABJ held a meeting in September 1974 between PABJ member Moore and representatives of the Temple University School of Communications and Theater to discuss the hiring of Black newspeople. Temple accepted ABJ’s assistance. ABJ offered to visit nearby colleges, including Lincoln University and Cheyney State College, and local high schools.

According to Stone, the ABJ group decided to approach Temple for its 20 percent Black student population. Stone accused the university of having no Black faculty members, but a former Temple journalism department dean pushed back.

In 1970, a professor in Temple’s communications school found in two surveys of newspapers across the country that the number of Blacks was under two percent.

== Early programming ==
ABJ and Temple cooperated in a journalism-training session for high school students in 1977. The organization held annual awards banquets to raise money for scholarships and operations. Another of its programs was &quot;Artists Among Us,&quot; begun in 2002, which brought together journalists to show off their talents beyond journalism. Among the presenters was cartoonist Robb Armstrong, who created the Black comic strip &quot;Jump Start.&quot; The organization later offered candidate forums and other events.

The first awards banquet was held on February 28, 1976, with Benjamin C. Hooks, commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, as speaker. Then Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey dropped by and gave a short speech. The ABJ logo designed by member Earl E. Davis and a banner sewn by Violet B. Johnson, wife of member Tyree Johnson (who would become the third president), were unveiled.

ABJ presented the Orrin Evans/Art Peters Journalism Award to Black New York photographer James Van Der Zee and the ABJ Award for Continuing Excellence to attorney Charles W. Bowser. During the 1930s and 1940s, Evans was one of the first Black reporters to work for white-owned newspapers and was considered the dean of Black journalists. In the early 1970s, Peters wrote a column in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;.

The second banquet was held on February 26, 1977, and Vernon Jordan, president of the National Urban League, was the guest speaker.

ABJ presented awards to CBS correspondent Ed Bradley and the Rev. Paul Washington, an activist rector at the Church of the Advocate.

Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson was the speaker at the February 25, 1978, banquet. Operation Push leader Jesse Jackson, Congressman Walter Fauntroy and actor Oscar Brown Jr. made an appearance. Percy Qoboza, an anti-apartheid editor at South Africa’s largest Black newspaper, received the Orrin Evans-Art Peters Journalism Award. Housing advocate Shirley Dennis was presented the ABJ Award for Continuing Excellence.

The organization held its first career conference in 1979.

== “Black Perspective on the News” ==
In 1973, Moore and Bryant began hosting and co-producing “Black Perspective on the News” on WHYY-TV as a local news-analysis program. In August 1974, it went national on PBS. ABJ members were among those who participated in the interviews.The fact that there are two societies, two lifestyles,… Black and white, and the unique position of the Black journalist as participant in both, is probably the most exciting concept behind the program,” Moore said in a newspaper article in 1973. “This program affords the journalists on the panel the opportunity to ask questions from their own unique positions, from ‘two sides’ as it were, and this broad basis is what makes the program important to Black and white audiences.The program was created as a local show in 1968 by Lionel J. Monagas, who was the first Black professional hired at WHYY-TV. In the early 1970s, it was hosted by Jimmy McDonald, who was among the 1961 Freedom Riders. The show was seen in 32 cities.

Before becoming a part of “Black Perspective,” Moore and Lewis, along with Haynes, had appeared as contributing reporters on a local-news analysis program at KYW-TV in 1971 called “Black Edition.” Its hosts were Malcolm Poindexter, Jesse Brown and Trudy Haynes.

<doc id="1296131" wikidata="Q5031245" url="?curid=1296131" title="Canberra Cannons">
<text>The Canberra Cannons are a defunct professional men&#x27;s basketball team that competed in Australia&#x27;s National Basketball League (NBL). They went into financial administration in 2003 and were relocated to Newcastle, where they became the Hunter Pirates. After this venture also folded the team was relocated to Singapore and played as the Singapore Slingers for the 2006–07 season.

The Cannons were runners-up in the inaugural 1979 competition and then won three championships in 1983, 1984 and 1988. They were also runners-up in 1989.

==History==
The Cannons were one of the original ten NBL clubs, competing in the league&#x27;s very first season in 1979. They reached the championship game with a 13–5 record, but fell at the final hurdle, losing to the St Kilda Saints 94–93 in the final.

Canberra failed to make the playoffs over the next few seasons, but in 1983 they won their first NBL championship, downing the defending champions the West Adelaide Bearcats 75–73 in the Grand Final. Adelaide born Guard Phil Smyth joined the team in 1983 and led the NBL in steals and assists as well as being selected at Point guard in the All-NBL Team.

In 1983, the Cannons&#x27; trio of Wade Kirchmeyer, Dave Nelson and Garry Ball were dubbed the &quot;Bruise Brothers&quot;. Following the league&#x27;s import reduction from three to two, Kirchmeyer was not re-signed for 1984.

The Cannons repeated as champions in 1984, this time beating the Brisbane Bullets 84–82 in the big game. Smyth again had a big season, being named to the All-NBL Team.

Canberra made the playoffs for the next three seasons but would fall to the Bullets in the semi-finals each time. Championship glory eluded the Cannons until 1988, when swept the minor premiers the Adelaide 36ers in the semi-finals then beat the North Melbourne Giants 2–1 in a best-of-three championship series. Smyth again was named to the All-NBL Team after leading the league in three-point percentage, free-throw percentage and steals, and was also named Best Defensive Player. Smyth also won the Grand Final MVP after averaging 23.3 points, 3.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists over the series. 7&#x27;0&quot; (213 cm) import centre Willie Simmons also led the league in blocks, averaging 3.6 per game.

North Melbourne exacted their revenge in 1989, beating the Cannons 2–0 in the championship series. It would prove to be the last time the Cannons played in the NBL Grand Final.

The Cannons failed to make the playoffs again until 1992, when they were eliminated in the first round by the eventual champions, the South East Melbourne Magic. They reached the playoffs in 1996 making the semi-finals before being eliminated by the Melbourne Tigers 2–1. They again made the finals in 1997 but were eliminated in the first round 2-1 by North Melbourne.

Financial problems dogged the club in the late 1990s, and the team finally succumbed to its money woes in December 2002. The club managed to play all its remaining games from the 2002–03 NBL season, but were unable to hold on to their star players, including C. J. Bruton, the son of then-coach Cal Bruton, or any imports. Canberra finished with an 11–19 record, and the team was bought by a consortium that moved the team to Newcastle.

During the 2002 off-season, the Cannons embarked on a short tour of the United States playing various college teams. On one occasion they played against the Michigan State Spartans at the Breslin Center in Lansing. For that game, the Cannons featured former Michigan State player, NBA legend with the Los Angeles Lakers and one of the most decorated players in basketball history, Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson. The game, a celebration of Johnson&#x27;s induction into the Hall of Fame in 2002, saw the Cannons defeat the Spartans (who featured future NBL player Adam Ballinger) 104–85 with Magic contributing 12 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds.

In April 2022, NBL owner Larry Kestelman flagged Canberra as a potential 11th team. Kestelman says &quot;Canberra could be next in line for a league license, following the same model as the Tasmania JackJumpers&quot;.

<text>Salvatore Accardo (; born 26 September 1941 in Turin, northern Italy) is an Italian violinist and conductor, who is known for his interpretations of the works of Niccolò Paganini.

Accardo owns one Stradivarius violin, the &quot;Hart ex Francescatti&quot; (1727) and had the &quot;Firebird ex Saint-Exupéry&quot; (1718).
==Biography==
Accardo studied violin in the southern Italian city of Naples in the 1950s. He gave his first professional recital at the age of 13 performing Paganini&#x27;s &quot;Capricci&quot;. In 1958 Accardo became the first prize winner of the Paganini Competition in Genoa.

In the 1970s he was a leader of the celebrated Italian chamber orchestra &quot;I Musici&quot; (1972-1977).

After studying in Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, he taught there from 1973 to 1980.

Accardo founded the Accardo Quartet in 1992 and he was one of the founders of the Walter Stauffer Academy in 1986.

He founded the Settimane Musicali Internazionali in Naples and the Cremona String Festival in 1971, and in 1996, he re-founded the Orchestra da Camera Italiana (O.C.I.), whose members are the best pupils of the Walter Stauffer Academy. The most famous pupils are Alessio Bidoli, Franco Mezzena and Anastasiya Petryshak.

He performed the music of Paganini for the soundtrack of the 1989 film &quot;Kinski Paganini&quot;.

In 2004, he came back to Siena, and now he teaches in Accademia Musicale Chigiana.

<doc id="1296149" wikidata="Q4200400" url="?curid=1296149" title="Impeachment of Bill Clinton">
<text>Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States, was impeached by the United States House of Representatives of the 105th United States Congress on December 19, 1998. The House adopted two articles of impeachment against Clinton, with the specific charges against Clinton being lying under oath and obstruction of justice. Two other articles had been considered but were rejected by the House vote.

Clinton&#x27;s impeachment came after a formal House inquiry, which had been launched on October 8, 1998. The charges for which Clinton was impeached stemmed from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones. During pre-trial discovery in the lawsuit, Clinton gave testimony denying that he had engaged in a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The catalyst for the president&#x27;s impeachment was the Starr Report, a September 1998 report prepared by Ken Starr, Independent Counsel, for the House Judiciary Committee. The Starr Report included details outlining a sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky. Clinton was the second American president to be impeached, the first being Andrew Johnson, who was impeached in 1868.

The approved articles of impeachment would be submitted to the United States Senate on January 7, 1999. A trial in the Senate then began, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding. On February 12, Clinton was acquitted on both counts as neither received the necessary two-thirds majority vote of the senators present for conviction and removal from office—in this instance 67 votes were needed. On Article One, 45 senators voted to convict while 55 voted for acquittal. On Article Two, 50 senators voted to convict while 50 voted for acquittal. Clinton remained in office for the remainder of his second term.

== Background ==
In 1994, Paula Jones filed a lawsuit accusing Clinton of sexual harassment when he was governor of Arkansas. Clinton attempted to delay a trial until after he left office, but in May 1997 the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Clinton&#x27;s claim that the Constitution immunized him from civil lawsuits, and shortly thereafter the pre-trial discovery process commenced.

Separate from this, in January 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert B. Fiske as an Independent counsel to investigate the Whitewater controversy. In August of that year, Ken Starr was appointed to replace Fiske in this role.

In 1997, the first effort in Congress to start an impeachment against Clinton was launched by Republican Congressman Bob Barr.

In a January 17, 1998, sworn deposition, Clinton denied having a &quot;sexual relationship&quot;, &quot;sexual affair&quot;, or &quot;sexual relations&quot; with Lewinsky. His lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, stated with Clinton present that Lewinsky&#x27;s affidavit showed there was no sex in any manner, shape or form between Clinton and Lewinsky. The &quot;Starr Report&quot; states that the following day, Clinton &quot;coached&quot; his secretary Betty Currie into repeating his denials should she be called to testify.

After rumors of the scandal reached the news, Clinton publicly said, &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.&quot; But months later, Clinton admitted his relationship with Lewinsky was &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;not appropriate&quot;. Lewinsky engaged in oral sex with Clinton several times.

One of Clinton&#x27;s defenses against the charges was claiming his testimony have been dismissed in the Jones case because the judge had ruled it immaterial to her lawsuit. The media and other defenders pickup on this and reported this as fact. However, as noted in Hofstra Law Review citing Judge Wrights contempt ruling and referral to the Arkansas Bar for disbarment:

&quot;Effectively taking judicial notice of the &quot;immateriality&quot; spin which
Clinton defenders had put on that ruling, Judge Wright later expressly
held that &quot;contrary to numerous assertions, this Court did not rule that
evidence of the Lewinsky matter was irrelevant or immaterial to the issues
in plaintiff&#x27;s case.&quot;&#x27; Judge Wright repeated &quot;that such evidence
might have been relevant to plaintiff&#x27;s case,&quot; probative to &quot;&#x27;establish,
among other things, intent, absence of mistake, motive, and habit on the
part of the President.&quot;

Jones vs Clinton 993 F. Supp. 1217, 1222 (E.D. Ark. 1998)
Judge Wright ruling
The &quot;Starr Report&quot; was released to Congress on September 9, 1998, and to the public on September 11. In the report, Starr argued that there were eleven possible grounds for impeachment of Clinton, including perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and abuse of power. The report also detailed explicit and graphic details of the sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky.

== Independent counsel investigation ==

The charges arose from an investigation by Ken Starr, an Independent Counsel. With the approval of United States Attorney General Janet Reno, Starr conducted a wide-ranging investigation of alleged abuses, including the Whitewater controversy, the firing of White House travel agents, and the alleged misuse of FBI files. On January 12, 1998, Linda Tripp, who had been working with Jones&#x27;s lawyers, informed Starr that Lewinsky was preparing to commit perjury in the Jones case and had asked Tripp to do the same. She also said Clinton&#x27;s friend Vernon Jordan was assisting Lewinsky. Based on the connection to Jordan, who was under scrutiny in the Whitewater probe, Starr obtained approval from Reno to expand his investigation into whether Lewinsky and others were breaking the law.

A much-quoted statement from Clinton&#x27;s grand jury testimony showed him questioning the precise use of the word &quot;is&quot;. Contending his statement that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing going on between us&quot; had been truthful because he had no ongoing relationship with Lewinsky at the time he was questioned, Clinton said, &quot;It depends on what the meaning of the word &#x27;is&#x27; is. If the—if he—if &#x27;is&#x27; means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement.&quot; Starr obtained further evidence of inappropriate behavior by seizing the computer hard drive and email records of Monica Lewinsky. Based on the president&#x27;s conflicting testimony, Starr concluded that Clinton had committed perjury. Starr submitted his findings to Congress in a lengthy document, the &quot;Starr Report&quot;, which was released to the public via the Internet a few days later and included descriptions of encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky. Starr was criticized by Democrats for spending $70 million on the investigation. Critics of Starr also contend that his investigation was highly politicized because it regularly leaked tidbits of information to the press in violation of legal ethics, and because his report included lengthy descriptions which were humiliating and irrelevant to the legal case.

== Impeachment inquiry by the House Committee on the Judiciary ==
On October 8, 1998, the United States House of Representatives voted to authorize a broad impeachment inquiry, thereby initiating the impeachment process. The Republican controlled House of Representatives had decided this with a bipartisan vote of 258–176, with 31 Democrats joining Republicans. Since Ken Starr had already completed an extensive investigation, the House Judiciary Committee conducted no investigations of its own into Clinton&#x27;s alleged wrongdoing and held no serious impeachment-related hearings before the 1998 midterm elections. Impeachment was one of the major issues in those elections.

In the November 1998 House elections, the Democrats picked up five seats in the House, but the Republicans still maintained majority control. The results went against what House Speaker Newt Gingrich predicted, who, before the election, had been reassured by private polling that Clinton&#x27;s scandal would result in Republican gains of up to thirty House seats. Shortly after the elections, Gingrich, who had been one of the leading advocates for impeachment, announced he would resign from Congress as soon as he was able to find somebody to fill his vacant seat; Gingrich fulfilled this pledge, and officially resigned from Congress on January 3, 1999.

Impeachment proceedings were held during the post-election, &quot;lame duck&quot; session of the outgoing 105th United States Congress. Unlike the case of the 1974 impeachment process against Richard Nixon, the committee hearings were perfunctory but the floor debate in the whole House was spirited on both sides. The Speaker-designate, Representative Bob Livingston, chosen by the Republican Party Conference to replace Gingrich as House Speaker, announced the end of his candidacy for Speaker and his resignation from Congress from the floor of the House after his own marital infidelity came to light.
In the same speech, Livingston also encouraged Clinton to resign. Clinton chose to remain in office and urged Livingston to reconsider his resignation.
Many other prominent Republican members of Congress (including Dan Burton, Helen Chenoweth, and Henry Hyde, the chief House manager of Clinton&#x27;s trial in the Senate) had infidelities exposed about this time, all of whom voted for impeachment. Publisher Larry Flynt offered a reward for such information, and many supporters of Clinton accused Republicans of hypocrisy.

== Impeachment by House of Representatives ==
On December 11, 1998, the House Judiciary Committee agreed to send four articles of impeachment to the full House for consideration. The vote on two articles, grand jury perjury and obstruction of justice, was 21–17, both along party lines. On the other, perjury in the Paula Jones case, the committee voted 20–18, with Republican Lindsey Graham joining with Democrats, in order to give President Clinton &quot;the legal benefit of the doubt&quot;. The next day, December 12, the committee agreed to send a fourth and final article, for abuse of power, to the full House by a 21–17 vote, again, along party lines.

Although proceedings were delayed due to the bombing of Iraq, on the passage of H. Res. 611, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 19, 1998, on grounds of perjury to a grand jury (first article, 228–206) and obstruction of justice (third article, 221–212). The two other articles were rejected, the count of perjury in the Jones case (second article, 205–229) and abuse of power (fourth article, 148–285). Clinton thus became the second U.S. president to be impeached; the first, Andrew Johnson, was impeached in 1868. The only other previous U.S. president to be the subject of formal House impeachment proceedings was Richard Nixon in 1973–74. The Judiciary Committee agreed to a resolution containing three articles of impeachment in July 1974, but Nixon resigned from office soon thereafter, before the House took up the resolution.

Five Democrats (Virgil Goode, Ralph Hall, Paul McHale, Charles Stenholm and Gene Taylor) voted for the first three articles of impeachment, but only Taylor voted for the abuse of power charge. Five Republicans (Amo Houghton, Peter King, Connie Morella, Chris Shays and Mark Souder) voted against the first perjury charge. Eight more Republicans (Sherwood Boehlert, Michael Castle, Phil English, Nancy Johnson, Jay Kim, Jim Leach, John McHugh and Ralph Regula), but not Souder, voted against the obstruction charge. Twenty-eight Republicans voted against the second perjury charge, sending it to defeat, and eighty-one voted against the abuse of power charge.

== Senate trial ==

=== Preparation ===
Between December 20 and January 5, Republican and Democratic Senate leaders negotiated about the pending trial. There was some discussion about the possibility of censuring Clinton instead of holding a trial. Disagreement arose as to whether to call witnesses. This decision would ultimately not be made until after the opening arguments from the House impeachment managers and the White House defense team. On January 5, the Republican Majority Leader Trent Lott, announced that the trial would start on January 7.

===Officers===
Thirteen House Republicans from the Judiciary Committee served as &quot;managers&quot;, the equivalent of prosecutors: Henry Hyde (chairman), Jim Sensenbrenner, Bill McCollum, George Gekas, Charles Canady, Steve Buyer, Ed Bryant, Steve Chabot, Bob Barr, Asa Hutchinson, Chris Cannon, James E. Rogan and Lindsey Graham.

Clinton was defended by Cheryl Mills. Clinton&#x27;s counsel staff included Charles Ruff, David E. Kendall, Dale Bumpers, Bruce Lindsey, Nicole Seligman, Lanny A. Breuer and Gregory B. Craig.

===Process and schedule===
The Senate trial began on January 7, 1999, with Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist presiding. The first day consisted of formal presentation of the charges against Clinton, and of Rehnquist swearing in all senators.

A resolution on rules and procedure for the trial was adopted unanimously on the following day; however, senators tabled the question of whether to call witnesses in the trial. The trial remained in recess while briefs were filed by the House (January 11) and Clinton (January 13).

The managers presented their case over three days, from January 14 to 16, arguing for removal of the President from office by virtue of what they characterized as Clinton&#x27;s &quot;willful, premeditated, deliberate corruption of the nation&#x27;s system of justice through perjury and obstruction of justice&quot;. The defense presentation took place January 19–21. Clinton&#x27;s defense counsel argued that the case made against Clinton was, &quot;an unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that does not meet the constitutional standard to remove the President from office&quot;. January 22 and 23 were devoted to questions from members of the Senate to the House managers and Clinton&#x27;s defense counsel. Under the rules, all questions (over 150) were to be written down and given to Rehnquist to read to the party being questioned.

On January 25, Senator Robert Byrd moved for dismissals of both articles of impeachment. On the following day, Representative Bryant moved to call witnesses to the trial, a question the Senate had scrupulously avoided to that point. In both cases, the Senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session, rather than public, televised procedure. On January 27, the Senate voted on both motions in public session; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56–44, while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin. A day later, the Senate voted down motions to move directly to a vote on the articles of impeachment and to suppress videotaped depositions of the witnesses from public release, Senator Russ Feingold again voting with the Republicans.

Over three days, February 1–3, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton&#x27;s friend Vernon Jordan, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70–30 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6, featuring 30 excerpts of Lewinsky discussing her affidavit in the Paula Jones case, the hiding of small gifts Clinton had given her, and his involvement in procurement of a job for Lewinsky.

On February 8, closing arguments were presented with each side allotted a three-hour time slot. On the President&#x27;s behalf, White House Counsel Charles Ruff declared:
Chief Prosecutor Henry Hyde countered:
=== Acquittal ===

On February 9, 1999, after voting against a public deliberation on the verdict, the Senate began closed-door deliberations instead. On February 12, 1999, the Senate emerged from its closed deliberations and voted on the articles of impeachment. A two-thirds vote, equal to 67 votes if all Senators voted, would have been necessary to convict on either charge and remove the President from office. The perjury charge was defeated with 45 votes for conviction and 55 against, and the obstruction of justice charge was defeated with 50 for conviction and 50 against. Senator Arlen Specter voted &quot;not proved&quot; for both charges, which was considered by Chief Justice Rehnquist to constitute a vote of &quot;not guilty&quot;. All 45 Democrats in the Senate voted &quot;not guilty&quot; on both charges, as did five Republicans; they were joined by five additional Republicans in voting &quot;not guilty&quot; on the perjury charge.


== Subsequent events ==
=== Contempt of court citation ===

In April 1999, about two months after being acquitted by the Senate, Clinton was cited by federal District Judge Susan Webber Wright for civil contempt of court for his &quot;willful failure&quot; to obey her orders to testify truthfully in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. For this, Clinton was assessed a $90,000 fine and the matter was referred to the Arkansas Supreme Court to see if disciplinary action would be appropriate.

Regarding Clinton&#x27;s January 17, 1998, deposition where he was placed under oath, Webber Wright wrote:
On the day before leaving office on January 20, 2001, Clinton, in what amounted to a plea bargain, agreed to a five-year suspension of his Arkansas law license and to pay a $25,000 fine as part of an agreement with independent counsel Robert Ray to end the investigation without the filing of any criminal charges for perjury or obstruction of justice. On October 1, 2001, Clinton was accordingly suspended from the practice of law in the United States Supreme Court who also issued an order to show cause in 40 days &quot;why he should not be disbarred from the practice of law in this Court.&quot; Clinton resigned from the Supreme Court bar during the show-cause period, and the Supreme Court accordingly ordered his name &quot;stricken from the roll of attorneys admitted to the practice of law before this Court.&quot;

=== Civil settlement with Paula Jones ===

Eventually, the court dismissed the Paula Jones harassment lawsuit, before trial, on the grounds that Jones failed to demonstrate any damages. However, while the dismissal was on appeal, Clinton entered into an out-of-court settlement by agreeing to pay Jones $850,000.

McCullam and Bryant later lost bids for the Senate while Rogan lost his seat to future lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff who led then President Donald Trump&#x27;s impeachment in 2020. Graham successfully ran for the Senate in 2002 where he&#x27;s currently serving.

=== Political ramifications ===

Polls conducted during 1998 and early 1999 showed that only about one-third of Americans supported Clinton&#x27;s impeachment or conviction. However, one year later, when it was clear that impeachment would not lead to the ousting of the President, half of Americans said in a CNN/&quot;USA Today&quot;/Gallup poll that they supported impeachment, 57% approved of the Senate&#x27;s decision to keep him in office, and two-thirds of those polled said the impeachment was harmful to the country.

While Clinton&#x27;s job approval rating rose during the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and subsequent impeachment, his poll numbers with regard to questions of honesty, integrity and moral character declined. As a result, &quot;moral character&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot; weighed heavily in the next presidential election. According to &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, after the 2000 presidential election, &quot;post-election polls found that, in the wake of Clinton-era scandals, the single most significant reason people voted for Bush was for his moral character.&quot;
According to an analysis of the election by Stanford University:
The Stanford analysis, however, presented different theories and mainly argued that Gore had lost because he decided to distance himself from Clinton during the campaign. The writers of it concluded:
According to the America&#x27;s Future Foundation:
Political commentators have argued that Gore&#x27;s refusal to have Clinton campaign with him was a bigger liability to Gore than Clinton&#x27;s scandals. The 2000 U.S. Congressional election also saw the Democrats gain more seats in Congress. As a result of this gain, control of the Senate was split 50–50 between both parties, and Democrats would gain control over the Senate after Republican Senator Jim Jeffords defected from his party in early 2001 and agreed to caucus with the Democrats.

Al Gore reportedly confronted Clinton after the election, and &quot;tried to explain that keeping Clinton under wraps [during the campaign] was a rational response to polls showing swing voters were still mad as hell over the Year of Monica&quot;. According to the AP, &quot;during the one-on-one meeting at the White House, which lasted more than an hour, Gore used uncommonly blunt language to tell Clinton that his sex scandal and low personal approval ratings were a hurdle he could not surmount in his campaign... [with] the core of the dispute was Clinton&#x27;s lies to Gore and the nation about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;;/x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton, however, was unconvinced by Gore&#x27;s argument and insisted to Gore that he would have won the election if he had embraced the administration and its good economic record.

===Partial retraction from Starr===

In January 2020, while testifying as a defense lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump during his first Senate impeachment trial, Starr himself would retract some of the allegations he made to justify Clinton&#x27;s impeachment. Slate journalist Jeremy Stahl pointed out that as he was urging the Senate not to remove Trump as president, Starr contradicted various arguments he used in 1998 to justify Clinton&#x27;s impeachment. In defending Trump, Starr also claimed he was wrong to have called for impeachment against Clinton for abuse of executive privilege and efforts to obstruct Congress, and stated that the House Judiciary Committee was right in 1998 to have rejected one of the planks for impeachment he had advocated for. He also invoked a 1999 &quot;Hofstra Law Review&quot; article by Yale law professor Akhil Amar, who argued that the Clinton impeachment proved just how impeachment and removal causes &quot;grave disruption&quot; to a national election.

<doc id="1296151" wikidata="Q16016463" url="?curid=1296151" title="Habibullah (Bagram detainee)">
<text>Mullah Habibullah was an Afghan who died on December 4, 2002 while in US custody at the Bagram Collection Point, a US military detention center in Afghanistan.
His death was one of those classed as a homicide, though the initial military statement described his death as due to natural causes.

Habibullah&#x27;s brother was a Taliban commander.
Carlotta Gall, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter in Afghanistan, was the first to discover the story in 2003.
Captain Carolyn Wood, commander of Alpha Company of the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion, and
Captain Christopher Beiring, commander of the 377th Military Police Company, directed their troops at the Bagram Collection Point to confine their captives with their arms handcuffed above their heads in order to deprive them of sleep.
Lt. Gen. Daniel K. McNeill was later quoted in the press denying that Bagram prisoners had been chained to the ceiling or held in chains attached to the ceiling.
Their troops routinely kneed their captives in the side of their thighs. They called these &quot;compliance blows&quot;. During a Criminal Investigation Division inquiry their troops claimed they had been told—incorrectly—that this kind of blow was a legal, authorized use of force.

==Causes of death==
Habibullah&#x27;s autopsy was performed two days after his death, and classed his death as a homicide.
Dr. Ingwerson said the cause of death was &quot;Pulmonary embolism due to blunt force injury to the legs.&quot;
But this did not prevent the GIs staffing the prison from continuing to use these &quot;compliance blows&quot;, and a second Afghan, Dilawar, died four days later, on December 10, 2002, under practically identical circumstances. Dr. Elizabeth Rouse, the coroner for Dilawar, said she had seen similar damage to a man whose legs had been run over by a bus.

==Prosecutions==
By 2005, at least 15 American soldiers had been recommended for prosecution by Army investigators for abuse of detainees at Bagram. At least five of the soldiers were charged with crimes involving Habibullah&#x27;s treatment. Captain Christopher Beiring was charged with dereliction of duty and making false statements; the charges were dropped, but he was reprimanded. Sgt. Christopher Greatorex was tried on charges of abuse, maltreatment, and making false statements; he was acquitted on September 7, 2005. Sgt. Darin Broady was tried on charges of abuse and acquitted on September 9, 2005. Specialist Brian Cammack pleaded guilty to charges of assault and making false statements; he was sentenced to three months in jail, a fine, reduced in rank to private, and given a bad conduct discharge. Pfc. Willie Brand was convicted of other charges, but acquitted of charges relating to abuse of Habibullah.

<doc id="1296167" wikidata="Q5419884" url="?curid=1296167" title="Executive Order 13224">
<text>Executive Order 13224 is an executive order issued by U.S. president George W. Bush on September 23, 2001, as a response to the attacks on September 11, 2001. It has been renewed every year since.

==History==
In general terms, the Order provides a means by which to disrupt the financial support network for terrorists and terrorist organizations by authorizing the U.S. Department of State, in consultation with the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and Justice, to designate and block the assets of foreign individuals and entities that commit, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism. The Order also authorizes the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the U.S. Departments of State and Justice, to designate and block the assets of individuals and entities that provide support, services, or assistance to, or otherwise associate with, terrorists and terrorist organizations designated under the Order, as well as their subsidiaries, front organizations, agents, and associates. In addition, it invokes a law that allows the President to bar transactions involving donations, food, clothing, and medicine and other articles &quot;intended to be used to relieve human suffering&quot;, when the President finds donations would &quot;seriously impair his ability to deal with any national emergency&quot;, are coerced or would endanger U.S. armed forces.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It maintains a list of individuals and organizations identified by Executive Order 13224, from the U.S. Department of State website.

One of the first organisations that Executive Order 13224 was used on was the Palestinian-American charity the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development. It was raided and closed on 4 December 2001. The HLF was the largest Muslim charity in the United States at the time.

==Provisions==
* Except to the extent required by section 203(b) of International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (), or provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all property and interests in property of the following persons that are in the United States or that hereafter come within the United States, or that hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons are blocked.
* Except to the extent required by section 203(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)), or provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date.
* Definitions
** Determination: the making of donations of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by United States persons to persons determined to be subject to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and would endanger Armed Forces of the United States that are in a situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. Furthermore, I hereby determine that the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (title IX, Public Law 106– 387) shall not affect the imposition or the continuation of the imposition of any unilateral agricultural sanction or unilateral medical sanction on any person determined to be subject to this order because imminent involvement of the Armed Forces of the United States in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.
** Effective date and publication: This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 24, 2001. This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register.

<doc id="1296171" wikidata="Q516537" url="?curid=1296171" title="Big Boi and Dre Present... Outkast">
<text>Big Boi and Dre Present… Outkast is the only compilation album by the American Southern hip hop duo Outkast. It was released December 4, 2001 through LaFace/Arista Records. The compilation is composed of four new tracks, including three new songs—&quot;Funkin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;The Whole World&quot; and &quot;Movin&#x27; Cool (The After Party)&quot;, as well as five songs from &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot;, one from &quot;ATLiens&quot;, and three each from &quot;Aquemini&quot; and &quot;Stankonia&quot;.

Recording sessions took place at Stankonia Recording and DARP Studios in Atlanta. Production was handled by Earthtone III and Organized Noize. It features guest appearances from Goodie Mob, Joi, Killer Mike and Sleepy Brown.

The album peaked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 4 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums in the United States. On March 6, 2002, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for 1,000,000 copies sold in the US. It also made it to No. 25 in New Zealand and No. 78 in Germany. In 2021, the album received Silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry for selling 60,000 units in the UK. Its lead single, &quot;The Whole World&quot;, was charted in several countries and won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 2003.

==Background==
Although the compilation encompasses several hit songs from the duo, Big Boi and André 3000 don&#x27;t consider it to be a &quot;greatest hits&quot; or &quot;best-of&quot; release. Big Boi described the album as &quot;more like a refresher course… summer school on Outkast 101&quot;, and stated &quot;[we&#x27;re] just letting all the fans that went and got &quot;Stankonia&quot; know that there were three albums that came out before that. We picked some of the favourite songs from all the albums [for the compilation].&quot; André added &quot;after the &quot;Stankonia&quot; album, we gained a lot of new fans. They didn&#x27;t know about &quot;Southernplayalistic&quot;, &quot;ATLiens&quot;, &quot;Aquemini&quot;. We had to give them the beginning to let them know where we&#x27;re at right now&quot;.

The title track from &quot;ATLiens&quot; is mentioned as being included on the compilation in the essay contained in the booklet, but is not actually featured (it is assumed it was dropped at a late stage of the album&#x27;s production).

<text>Elliniko (, before 1927: Μουλάτσι - &quot;Moulatsi&quot;) is a mountain village in western Arcadia, Greece (the original village name of “Moulatsi” was referenced in Ottoman Empire documents as far back as 1515).

It is part of the municipal unit of Trikolonoi. It is situated on a mountain slope on the left bank of the river Lousios. It is 4 km south of Stemnitsa, 4 km east of Atsicholos, 5 km northeast of Karytaina and 14 km northwest of Megalopoli.

The ruins of the ancient city Gortys are on the right bank of the river Lousios, near the road from Elliniko to Atsicholos.

Greek politician Dimitris Avramopoulos hails from Elliniko as well as prominent “multi generational” companies owned by the Fourlis and Kourouniotis Families.

<doc id="1296213" wikidata="Q722956" url="?curid=1296213" title="Phil Housley">
<text>Phillip Francis Housley (born March 9, 1964) is an American professional ice hockey coach and former player who is currently an associate coach for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously served as assistant coach for the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 2019 to 2022. Housley was the head coach of the NHL&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres from 2017 until 2019.

Playing as a defenseman, Housley was drafted by the Sabres in the first round of the 1982 NHL Entry Draft and had a long and illustrious career playing for the Sabres, Winnipeg Jets, St. Louis Blues, Calgary Flames, New Jersey Devils, Washington Capitals, Chicago Blackhawks, and Toronto Maple Leafs. As a player, Housley was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2012, and the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Playing career==
Housley is the second leading scorer amongst American-born players, with 1,232 points (338–894). He held the record for most points by an American-born NHL player until Mike Modano surpassed it on November 7, 2007.

Housley never won the Stanley Cup, coming closest with the Capitals in 1998, where they were swept in the Stanley Cup Finals by the Detroit Red Wings. At the time of retirement, Housley had played more NHL games without winning the Stanley Cup than any other player in NHL history until the retirement of Shane Doan in 2017, Jarome Iginla in 2018 and Patrick Marleau in 2022.

On January 21, 2000, Housley played in his 1,257th NHL game, the most ever at the time by an American, breaking the record held by Craig Ludwig. Housley went on to play in 1,495 NHL games. He held the record for games played by an American-born player for nearly seven years, until it was broken, on November 24, 2006, by Chris Chelios.

Housley was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 9, 2015. On February 7, 2007, he was inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame, commemorated in a pre-game ceremony with former head coach Scotty Bowman on hand.

==Coaching career==
From 2004 to 2013, Housley coached high school hockey at Stillwater Area High School in Stillwater, Minnesota, helping to rebuild the program to respectability. From 2013 to 2017, Housley was an assistant coach for the Nashville Predators, working primarily with defensemen.

On January 5, 2013, Housley coached Team USA to the gold medal at the 2013 IIHF World U20 Championship in Ufa, Russia. He had served as an assistant coach on Team USA&#x27;s 2007 and 2011 appearances in the World Juniors.

On June 15, 2017, it was announced that Housley was hired by the Buffalo Sabres as their new head coach. He led the Sabres to a 31st-place finish in his first season and saw the Sabres attain a 10-game winning streak early in his second season before the team collapsed down the stretch. Housley was fired by the Sabres after the 2018–19 season on April 7, 2019.

On June 26, 2019, it was announced that Housley signed a multi-year contract as assistant coach for the Arizona Coyotes. For the Coyotes, Housley served as defensive coordinator and power play coach.

With his contract set to expire, Housley and the Coyotes agreed to part ways on May 1, 2022. He joined the New York Rangers as an associate coach in June 2023.

==Personal life==
Housley grew up in South St. Paul, Minnesota. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Karin Housley, a Minnesota state senator. The Housleys have four grown children and reside in St. Marys Point, Minnesota.

== History ==
For a detailed history of the monastery, see the article about Salem Abbey.

The area has been populated since at least the Bronze Age. Beginning in the 3rd century, the Alemanni and, later, the Franks established several villages, including the small settlement of Salemanneswilare (later Salmannsweiler). Salem Abbey, founded by the Order of Cistercians, was established here in 1134. It quickly achieved the rank of an imperial abbey.

From about 1285 to 1425, the High Gothic Salem Münster (Minster) was built, and it has been preserved until the current day. During the 17th century, the monastery had to cope with serious setbacks, including the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which brought death and destruction to many areas.

In 1697, a fire destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also numerous art treasures owned by the abbey. Subsequently, under the master builder Franz Beer of Vorarlberg, the Baroque buildings currently standing on the site were built.

Among other things, Abbot Anselm II Schwab founded an Orphans&#x27; Fund in 1749 that is considered the first savings bank in Germany. Anselm also had the pilgrimage church Birnau built on the shores of Lake Constance.

The heyday of the monastery ended with the German mediatization in 1803. It was secularized, and the territory fell to the Margraviate of Baden.

== Culture and sights ==

The Cistercian monastery of Salem Abbey was founded in 1134, when the knight Guntram von Adelsreute donated land for its establishment. The abbey already had its own scriptorium in the 12th century and formed one of the most important monastery libraries in Europe.
Currently, the grounds are home to the middle school campus of Schule Schloss Salem, a boarding school founded in 1920 by Kurt Hahn and Prince Max of Baden. The abbey complex covers a total of 17 hectares.

Other sights are the Gothic-style Salem Minster (the former church of the abbey complex) and the Baroque chapel.

== Sports ==
In summer, the Schlosssee (castle lake) attracts swimmers from all over the region. There are also tennis courts, a football and athletics stadium, sports grounds, sports halls and rehearsal rooms for teams.

== Teams ==

== Regular events ==
The Schloss Seefest Salem, one of the largest open-air events in the Lake Constance region, is held every first summer holiday weekend. International artists perform large outdoor concerts on the castle grounds in the lakeside park.

<doc id="1296241" wikidata="Q15514985" url="?curid=1296241" title="Lewis Ginter">
<text>Lewis Ginter (April 4, 1824 – October 2, 1897) was a prominent businessman, financier, military officer, real estate developer, and philanthropist centered in Richmond, Virginia. A native of New York City, Ginter accumulated a considerable fortune throughout his numerous business ventures and became one of Richmond&#x27;s wealthiest citizens despite his exceptionally modest demeanor. While the Jefferson Hotel and Ginter Park embody some of Ginter&#x27;s major urban contributions to Richmond, many of his philanthropic gifts were given anonymously to charitable organizations and individuals in need. Ginter served in the Confederacy, attaining the rank of major and played a major role in bringing Richmond back from the ravages of the Civil War. His continued devotion to the city is captured in his famous remark, &quot;I am for Richmond, first and last.&quot;

==Early life==
Lewis Ginter was born to John and Elizabeth Ginter on April 4, 1824, in New York City. His father owned a grocery store, but died soon after Ginter was born. Several years later, Ginter&#x27;s mother died, leaving him to be raised by his married sister, Jane Ginter Arents.

==Richmond==
===Early business===
In 1842, at the age of eighteen, Ginter relocated to Richmond, Virginia, to open up a shop selling notions and toys. He had visited the city at least once before with an uncle. Ginter soon moved up to the &quot;house furnishings&quot; business. Then, in 1853, he began marketing wholesale notions and imported fancy goods to village and country merchants, and in early 1860 his nephew, George Arents, joined the partnership of Ginter, Alvey &amp; Arents. It was known as &quot;the largest wholesale notion house and handlers of white goods and Irish linen in the South.&quot; Ginter traveled throughout the United States and Europe in search of quality merchandise, and amassed a considerable fortune before the beginning of the American Civil War. Preparing for unpredictable times, Ginter invested in large quantities of tobacco, sugar, and cotton that were stored in Richmond warehouses in order to protect his wealth.

===Military office===
Although he was originally from the North, Ginter supported his adopted home in the Confederacy by buying Confederate bonds and waiving outstanding debts. Shortly after the war broke out, he volunteered in the Confederate Quartermaster Department in Richmond, amassing supplies for the troops. He joined the Confederate Army as a commissary with the rank of Major in 1862 and received praise from his superiors for his heroic deeds on and off the battlefield, which earned him the nickname &quot;The Fighting Commissary.&quot; Major Ginter served under Generals Robert E. Lee, Joseph R. Anderson, Stonewall Jackson, A.P. Hill and Edward Lloyd Thomas, and retained this title from affectionate Southerners long after the war ended. As fate would have it, Major Ginter was in the Confederate capital on official business during the Evacuation and capture of Richmond and retreated to Amelia Court House, Virginia, to meet up with the remnants of his brigade. He was present during Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House, and returned to Richmond several days later.

==New York==
Upon his return to Richmond, Ginter found the city in a state of ruin. His warehouse stores of tobacco and sugar were destroyed in a fire that consumed much of the business district, though his cotton remained unscathed. With little economic opportunity in Richmond, he sold his cotton and returned to New York City to pursue a career in banking. First joining the firm of Harrison &amp; Company, he experienced great financial success. But his renewed fortune was short-lived. The Black Friday gold panic in 1869 forced Ginter to use his personal fortune to settle heavy debts his firm incurred. Having lost all of his wealth once again, Ginter sold tobacco on consignment in New York for Richmond tobacconist John F. Allen. In 1872, Ginter decided to return to affordable Richmond.

==Return to Richmond==
===Tobacco===

In 1872, Ginter joined John F. Allen to form John F. Allen &amp; Company, which manufactured chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco and a small line of cigars. Shortly after, at Ginter&#x27;s urging, the firm was the first to manufacture cigarettes with mild, 100% domestic bright leaf tobacco, grown in the Virginia and North Carolina piedmont, rather than with strong &quot;Turkish&quot; tobaccos. When the firm released its first cigarettes in 1875, it was the first in the South to manufacture cigarettes as its primary branded product. Early production began in a factory with twenty young, white women, who hand-rolled the cigarettes. Initially, the cigarettes weren&#x27;t successful in the South, where men overwhelmingly preferred chewing tobacco. Around 1880, the firm was renamed Allen &amp; Ginter. Ginter&#x27;s &quot;Richmond Gem&quot; cigarettes were first a hit in London where, with help from his agent, John Morgan Richards, they were marketed as a foreign novelty. Allen &amp; Ginter also manufactured cigarettes with &quot;Turkish&quot; tobacco or blends. Their brands included &quot;Richmond Straight-Cut No. 1,&quot; &quot;The Pet,&quot; &quot;Dubec,&quot; &quot;Opera Puffs,&quot; and &quot;Our Little Beauties.&quot; In 1881, with growing competition in the tobacco industry, Ginter began leasing James Bonsack&#x27;s newly-invented cigarette rolling machine. By 1888, Allen &amp; Ginter employed over 1,000 workers and cigarette production increased from 100,000 per month to 2,000,000 per day. The firm eventually opened offices in London, Paris, and Berlin in order to meet foreign demand for their products. Allen &amp; Ginter continued to prosper until they merged with J. B. Duke, Kinney Brothers Tobacco Company, Goodwin &amp; Company and W.S. Kimball &amp; Company to form the American Tobacco Company in January 1890. Ginter was offered the presidency, but declined and remained a director until his death.

===Real estate===

Although Ginter had lived in Richmond for several decades, he did not purchase his first home until 1876. He invited his sister, Jane Arents, and three of her daughters, Grace, Joanna, and Minnie, to live with him at 405 East Cary Street. In 1891, he completed construction of a freestyle, Richardsonian Romanesque mansion in an elite neighborhood at 901 West Franklin Street. In modern times, the structure became property of Virginia Commonwealth University and it was known as the &quot;Ginter House.&quot; In September 2020, the University’s Board of Visitors voted to &quot;de-commemorate&quot; several buildings on campus named for members of the Confederacy including Ginter&#x27;s home.
The house is now simply known as the &quot;VCU Administration Building&quot;.

Ginter was inspired by the suburban developments in Melbourne and Sydney that he visited on one of many business trips marketing for Allen &amp; Ginter. Beginning in 1888, Ginter and John Pope began assembling large tracts of land just north of Richmond in Henrico County, with the intention of developing an upscale streetcar suburb. Their purchases included part of the original Westbrook Plantation, which they developed into their own country estate. Ginter&#x27;s renovated and enlarged Westbrook house included a private barbershop. An outbuilding featured an automated, one-lane bowling alley.&quot; Ginter and Pope divided the large swaths of land into residential plots and provided many extravagant amenities, such as fresh artesian wells, tile sewer lines, roads covered with crushed stone, and the extension of the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, the nation&#x27;s first large-scale electric streetcar system. The neighborhood, known as Ginter Park, attracted the Union Theological Seminary and was eventually annexed to the City of Richmond. Ginter also laid the groundwork for several adjoining neighborhoods, including Bellevue Park and Sherwood Park. He established the Lakeside Wheel Club in 1895, and Lakeside Park in 1896.

Always eager to improve Richmond, Ginter hired famed architects Carrère and Hastings in 1892 to design a world-class hotel known as the Jefferson. An estimated 5 to 10 million dollars was invested in the realization of the hotel before it opened on October 31, 1895. It was immediately praised as one of the finest hotels in the country. Ginter commissioned Edward V. Valentine to create a life-size sculpture of Thomas Jefferson from Carrara marble to be displayed as the centerpiece of the upper lobby. Additional novelties included exotic palm trees from Central and South America, numerous antiques, Turkish and Russian baths, electric elevators, and for a brief period, alligators in the lobby fountain. Not only did the Jefferson become an icon of Ginter&#x27;s immeasurable dedication to his adopted city, it symbolized Richmond&#x27;s growing post-war prosperity.

== John Pope ==
While working in New York City after the war, Ginter met John Pope, a messenger boy who delivered packages to his firm. Pope was born in New York City in 1856 to a German immigrant family. His father was a shoemaker, and Pope acquired the delivery job at the age of 14 to help his family make ends meet. Ginter eventually hired Pope to work in the New York tobacco depot. When Ginter relocated back to Richmond, he brought Pope along with him as his apprentice.

The two began an enduring business partnership that would last for the remainder of their lives. Pope grew to become Ginter&#x27;s trusted business partner and assumed a number of executive roles, including Vice President of Allen &amp; Ginter in 1888, and President of the Crystal Ice Company, James River Marl and Bone Phosphate Company, and Powhatan Clay Manufacturing Company. When the American Tobacco Company was formed in 1890, Pope served as vice-president and managed the centralized cigarette operations in Richmond. Like Ginter, Pope was involved in a number of philanthropic activities, and strove to avoid the public eye.

Ginter and Pope remained lifelong bachelors, both living in Ginter&#x27;s home, until Pope&#x27;s premature death in 1896. Pope was buried in a plot in Hollywood Cemetery that Ginter had reserved for himself. While the intimate details of their relationship are unknown, Pope&#x27;s obituary said he &quot;lived quietly with Major Ginter, for whom he possessed the most ardent affection.&quot; And Ginter&#x27;s obituary said he &quot;never pointedly sought&quot; the company of women.

==Death==
The death of Ginter&#x27;s close companion John Pope left him noticeably distraught. Ginter also suffered from diabetes, and his health quickly declined before being bedridden at his Westbrook estate. After two months of severe debilitation, Ginter died on October 2, 1897. His funeral was regarded as one of the largest in Richmond&#x27;s history, and about a year later his remains were placed in a private mausoleum in Hollywood Cemetery, overlooking the James River.

==Legacy==
At the time of his death, Ginter had amassed one of the largest personal fortunes in the South. His enduring commitment to Richmond is evidenced in his significant investments in real estate, business, and most notably, his philanthropic activity. Even while Ginter was traveling abroad, he reportedly ordered items from Richmond to support local merchants. His will included gifts to almost every charity and public institution in the city. The remainder of his wealth was left to his relatives, including his niece, Grace Arents, who continued in her uncle&#x27;s charitable footsteps. Arents converted the Lakeside Wheel Club into a progressive farm known as Bloemendaal, which she later arranged to become Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. She also developed St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal Church and St. Andrew&#x27;s School, built playgrounds, and funded numerous schools and medical institutions. In 1897, the &quot;Richmond Dispatch&quot; praised Ginter as &quot;one whose public spirit and broad charity have made his name familiar and honored throughout this city, which he loved so well, did so much to build up and beautify.&quot;

<doc id="1296253" wikidata="Q528393" url="?curid=1296253" title="Geoffroi Jacques Flach">
<text>Geoffroi Jacques Flach (February 16, 1846 – December 4, 1919) was a French jurist and historian born at Strasbourg, Alsace, of a family known at least as early as the 16th century, when Sigismond Flach was the first professor of law at University of Strasbourg.

G.J. Flach studied classics and law at Strasbourg, and in 1869 took his degree of doctor of law. In his theses as well as in his early writings such as &quot;De la subrogation réelle, La Bonorum possessio&quot;, and &quot;Sur la durée des effets de la minorité&quot; (1870) he endeavored to explain the problems of laws by means of history, an idea which was new to France at that time. The Franco-Prussian War engaged Flach&#x27;s activities in other directions, and he spent two years (described in his &quot;Strasbourg après le bombardment&quot;, 1873) at work on the rebuilding of the library and the museum, which had been destroyed by Prussian shells.

When the time came for him to choose between Germany and France, he settled definitely in Paris, where he completed his scientific training at the École des Chartes and the École des Hautes Études. Having acted for some time as secretary to Jules Sénard, ex-president of the Constituent Assembly, he published an original paper on artistic copyright, but as soon as possible resumed the history of law. In 1879 he became assistant to the jurist Édouard René de Laboulaye at the Collège de France, and succeeded him in 1884 in the chair of comparative legislation.

Since 1877 he had been professor of comparative law at the free school of the political sciences. To qualify himself for these two positions he had to study the most diverse civilizations, including those of the East and Far East (e.g. Hungary, Russia and Japan) and even the antiquities of Babylonia and other Asiatic countries. Some of his lectures have been published, particularly those concerning Ireland: &quot;Histoire du régime agraire de l&#x27;Irlande&quot; (1883); &quot;Considérations sur l&#x27;histoire politique de l&#x27;Irlande&quot; (1885); and &quot;Jonathan Swift, son action politique en Irlande&quot; (1886).

His chief efforts, however, were concentrated on the history of ancient French law. A celebrated lawsuit in Alsace, pleaded by his friend and compatriot Ignace Chauffour, aroused his interest by reviving the question of the origin of the feudal laws, and gradually led him to study the formation of those laws and the early growth of the feudal system. His great work, &quot;Les Origines de l&#x27;ancienne France&quot;, was produced slowly. In the first volume, &quot;Le Régime seigneurial&quot; (1886), he depicts the triumph of individualism and anarchy, showing how, after Charlemagne&#x27;s great but sterile efforts to restore the Roman principle of sovereignty, the great landowners gradually monopolized the various functions in the state; how society modelled on antiquity disappeared; and how the only living organisms were vassalage and clientship.

The second volume, &quot;Les Origines communales, et féodalité et la chevalerie&quot; (1893), deals with the reconstruction of society on new bases which took place in the 10th and 11th centuries. It explains how the Gallo-Roman villa gave place to the village, with its fortified castle, the residence of the lord; how new towns were formed by the side of old, some of which disappeared; how the townspeople united in corporations; and how the communal bond proved to be a powerful instrument of cohesion. At the same time it traces the birth of feudalism from the germs of the Gallo-Roman personal comitalus; and shows how the bond that united the different parties was the contract of the fief; and how, after a slow growth of three centuries, feudalism was definitely organized in the 12th century.

In 1904 appeared the third volume, &quot;La Renaissance de l&#x27;État&quot;, in which the author describes the efforts of the Direct Capetian kings to reconstruct the power of the Frankish kings over the whole of Gaul; and goes on to show how the clergy, the heirs of the imperial tradition, encouraged this ambition; how the great lords of the kingdom (the &quot;princes&quot;, as Flach calls them), whether as allies or foes, pursued the same end; and how, before the close of the 12th century, the Capetian kings were in possession of the organs and the means of action which were to render them so powerful and bring about the early downfall of feudalism.

In these three volumes, which appeared at long intervals, the author&#x27;s theories are not always in complete harmony, nor are they always presented in a very luminous or coherent manner, but they are marked by originality and vigour. Flach gave them a solid basis by the wide range of his researches, utilizing charters and cartularies (published and unpublished), chronicles, lives of saints, and even those dangerous guides, the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;.

He owed little to the historians of feudalism, who knew what feudalism was, but not how it came about. He pursued the same method in his &quot;L&#x27;Origine de l&#x27;habitation et des lieux habités en France&quot; (1899), in which he discusses some of the theories circulated by A Meitzen in Germany and by Arbois de Jubainville in France. Following in the footsteps of the jurist F. K. von Savigny, Flach studied the teaching of law in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and produced &quot;Cujas les glossateurs et les Bartolistes&quot; (1883), and &quot;Études critiques sur l&#x27;histoire du droit romain au moyen âge, avec textes inédits&quot; (1890).

Flach&#x27;s library was purchased by the University of Missouri in 1920 and is preserved at the University of Missouri Libraries.

<text>Muhu (also called Muhumaa in Estonian) is an island in the West Estonian archipelago of the Baltic Sea. With an area of , it is the third largest island belonging to Estonia, after Saaremaa and Hiiumaa.

Together with neighbouring smaller islands of Kesselaid, Viirelaid, Võilaid and Suurlaid, it forms Muhu Parish (), the rural municipality within Saare County. The municipality has a population of 1,968 (as of 2010) and covers an area of . The population density is .

==History and geography==
The German names for the island are Mohn and Moon. Moon is also the Swedish name for the island.

The most important villages in Muhu are Kuivastu, Liiva (where the school can be found) and Koguva. In Pädaste, an internationally renowned luxury hotel and spa operates in the restored manor house.

The island is divided from mainland Estonia by the Suur Strait (&quot;Moonsund&quot;) and from Saaremaa by the Väike Strait. It is linked by ferry to Virtsu on the mainland, and to Saaremaa by a causeway, the Väinatamm. In winter an ice road connects the island to the mainland.

In January 1227, an army of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword with Letts, Germans of Riga and native Livonians (20,000 men commanded by William of Modena) crossed on sea ice from the mainland and attacked the island of Saaremaa to reduce the last holdout of pagan Estonians. The Estonians surrendered on Muhu at a circular stronghold called Mona, the earthworks of which are still preserved near the causeway between the islands. This ended the Estonian Crusade.

The Battle of Karuse or Battle on the Ice was fought on 16 February 1270 between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Livonian Order on the frozen Baltic Sea between Muhu and the mainland. The Lithuanians achieved a decisive victory. The battle, named after the village of Karuse, was the fifth-largest defeat of the Livonian or Teutonic Orders in the 13th century.

The same waters saw the Battle of Moon Sound in September–October 1917 between Russian and German naval forces.

Muhu is the home of Estonia&#x27;s first wine tourism farm – Luscher &amp; Matiesen Muhu Winehouse.

==Culture==
Muhu is known for having the only traditional windmills in Estonia that are still operational. Muhu is also known for its traditional knitted stockings.

<text>Viktoria Yurievna Mullova (; born 27 November 1959) is a Russian-born British violinist. She is best known for her performances and recordings of a number of violin concerti, compositions by J.S. Bach, and her innovative interpretations of popular and jazz compositions by Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, The Beatles, and others.

==Biography and early career==
Mullova was born in Zhukovsky, 45 km from Moscow, in Soviet Russia. At the age of four, she was encouraged to start her violin training by her father Yuri Mullov, a Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute physicist and engineer. After studying at the and at the Moscow Conservatory under Leonid Kogan, she won first prize at the 1980 International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition in Helsinki and the gold medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1982. She remembered the whole experience of the Soviet quasi-religious state-sponsored musical education as an overly stressful nightmare full of hypocrisy: &quot;Naturally, I have never believed in communism. But everything was a play. I knew I wanted to leave, and I was pretending to be a naive girl&quot;.

==Defection==
During a tour of Finland in 1983, Mullova and her lover, Vakhtang Jordania, who posed as her accompanist so they could defect together, left the hotel in Kuusamo, after Jordania told the KGB officer who was watching them that Mullova was too sick from drinking to attend the afterparty. The Stradivari violin owned by the Soviet Union was left behind on the hotel bed. YLE journalist Jyrki Koulumies, accompanied by photographer Caj Sundman, drove them in a rented car across the border via Haparanda to Luleå, Sweden where they flew to Stockholm.

At that time, the Swedish police treated the young, on-the-run musicians just like any other political defectors from the Eastern Bloc: they suggested that the couple stay in a safehouse over the weekend until the American Embassy opened so they could apply for political asylum upon relocation. So for two days they sat under pseudonyms in a safehouse not even daring to go outside, because their photographs were on the front page of every Swedish and international newspaper. Two days later they arrived in Washington, D.C., with American visas in their pockets.

==Life in the West==
Mullova has made many recordings including her debut release of the Tchaikovsky and Jean Sibelius violin concertos which was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque.

She formed the Mullova Chamber Ensemble in the mid-1990s. The ensemble has toured Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and has recorded the Bach violin concertos on Philips Classics. She was nominated for a 1995 Grammy Award for her recording of the Bach Partitas, and she won a 1995 Echo Klassik award, a Japanese Record Academy Award and a Deutsche Schallplattenkritik prize for her recording of the Brahms violin concerto. Her recording of the Brahms B major Trio (no. 1) and Beethoven&#x27;s Archduke Trio with André Previn and Heinrich Schiff was released in 1995, receiving a further Diapason d&#x27;Or.

Mullova&#x27;s international career as a soloist has included performances with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Philharmonia, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Symphony, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. She has also performed as soloist and director with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.

Mullova plays the Jules Falk Stradivarius from 1723 and a violin made in 1750 by Giovanni Battista Guadagnini. Her bows include a Baroque style bow by a Walter Barbiero, one of the finest makers of modern bows, a Dodd and a Voirin.

==Personal life==
Mullova currently lives in Holland Park, London, England, with her husband, cellist Matthew Barley, and three children: the jazz bassist Misha Mullov-Abbado, from her relationship with conductor and pianist Claudio Abbado; Katia, from her relationship with violinist Alan Brind; and Nadia, who is a dancer in the Royal Ballet, from her marriage to Barley.

<text>Don Host Oblast was a province (&quot;oblast&quot;) of the Russian Empire which consisted of the territory of the Don Cossacks, coinciding approximately with present-day Rostov Oblast in Russia. Its administrative center was Cherkassk, and later Novocherkassk.

It comprised the areas where the Don Cossack Host settled in the Russian Empire. From 1786, the territory was officially named Don Host Land (), renamed Don Host Oblast in 1870.

During 1914, the oblast, with an area of 164,000 km², had about 3.9 million inhabitants. Of these, 55% (2.1 million) were Cossacks in possession of all the land; the remaining 45% of the population being townsfolk and agricultural guest labourers from other parts of Russia.

It was abolished in 1920; from the major part of it the Don Oblast of the RSFSR was created, which was incorporated into the North Caucasus Krai in 1924.

== Administrative divisions ==
The districts (&quot;okrugs&quot;) of the Don Host Oblast in 1897 were as follows:

A high school drama centered on character Momo Adachi, her love life, friendships and rivalries, it was published in Japan by Kodansha in &quot;Bessatsu Friend&quot; from 1998 to 2003 and collected in 18 volumes. The series was adapted as a Taiwanese drama in 2002 and a Japanese animated television series in 2005. A manga sequel set 10 years after the original manga, titled &quot;Peach Girl Next&quot;, began its serialization on &quot;Be Love&quot; on August 12, 2016. It ended with a total of eight volumes, the last of which was released in January 2020. On mid-March 2016, the live-action film adaptation was announced. The film was released in Japan on May 20, 2017.

The North American version of the manga is published by Kodansha USA, with all 18 volumes under the same title. It was previously published in two parts by Tokyopop: &quot;Peach Girl&quot;, covering the first eight volumes of the Japanese release; and &quot;Peach Girl: Change of Heart&quot;, comprising the final ten books. The animated TV series is distributed by Funimation Entertainment, currently known as Crunchyroll in North America.

==Plot==
Momo Adachi is a former member of the high school swim team. She tans easily and her hair is bleached out; unfortunately, she is stereotyped by her ignorant classmates and is forced to endure rumors about being an &quot;easy girl&quot; who has had many sexual relationships. Her only friend is Sae, who is actually responsible for spreading the nasty gossip due to her jealousy of Momo. Momo is in love with Toji, a taciturn baseball player, but the scheming Sae also has her sights set on the boy. Momo&#x27;s life is further complicated with the introduction of Kairi Okayasu, a wise-cracking playboy who is determined to make her his. He reveals to Momo that she had saved him from drowning the summer before high school started.

Things become even more complicated when Sae, in an attempt to make Momo miserable, spreads rumors about Momo and Kairi making out. The rumor about the kiss between the two is true, but it was Kairi who initiated it while Momo remained stunned by the interaction. When Toji is hospitalized, Sae convinces Toji to break up with Momo. Thanks to Kairi, he finds out about all the lies and rumors Sae has made up. Toji saves Momo from being bullied (thanks to Sae&#x27;s lies again) and tells the truth about him and Momo, resulting in the students apologizing to Momo and hating Sae. Toji and Momo get back together, but Sae later tries to complicate their relationship again by threatening to discredit Momo with her newly acquired access to the mass media. Though Toji is initially defiant, he reluctantly breaks up with Momo to protect her. Momo is heartbroken at first, particularly due to not knowing that it is part of Sae&#x27;s schemes. However, she eventually begins dating Kairi, whom she had previously considered annoying, and soon begins to fall in love with him. When it is revealed to Momo why Toji broke up with her, Momo is left to choose between Toji and Kairi. More problems arise and the love triangle intensifies.

In &quot;Sae&#x27;s Story&quot;, Sae is left back a year, for she was always skipping classes. She is too stubborn so she goes to Momo&#x27;s and Kairi&#x27;s university every day. Toji goes to a good university by himself. Sae then meets one of her childhood sweethearts, Kanji (or Monkey Boy), who left for Malaysia when they were young, and promised to marry Sae when he was back. In love with Sae, Kanji follows her around, trying to win her over. He takes care of Sae&#x27;s dog, Sora, when her parents would no longer let her keep it. The dog walks with a little limp; one day when Sora tried to follow Sae, she threw a rock at its paw and injured it. Sae starts modeling and pretends she goes to college with Momo, when she is really still in high school. She meets Honda and works for CC as a model. She meets a guy named Takuma, and he later turns her down. Sae meets another guy named Shinji but realizes he never really liked her. All these ups and downs make Sae realize that Momo, Kairi, and Kanji are the only people who care for her.

==Characters==
:
:Played by: Mizuki Yamamoto (Live Action 2017)
: The main protagonist. Her given name means &#x27;peach&#x27; in Japanese. She has tanned skin and light hair (derived from her constant swimming in chlorinated pools while on the swim team), mistakenly giving others the impression that she is a &quot;beach bunny&quot;, lover of the Ganguro style, or sexually promiscuous. On the contrary, Momo is a shy, insecure girl. She has loved Toji for many years, although later on she finds herself falling in love with Kairi. When she found out Toji disliked girls with tan skin, she started to avoid swimming pools and wore a lot of sunblock to get her skin to its original color (presumed to be fair). Later on, Momo finds out that Toji never said he disliked girls with tan skin. Her friend (Ryoko) from junior high had made that up because she had liked him too. She is often confused later on when she likes both Toji and Kairi at the same time, causing several disputes between the two boys.
:
:Played by: Mei Nagano (Live Action 2017)
: The main antagonist who does everything to ruin Momo&#x27;s life. Sae&#x27;s fair features such as her pale skin and dark hair serve as a contrast for Momo; her &quot;innocent&quot; appearance belies her scheming, mischievous, trouble making nature. She is the one who spreads malicious gossip about Momo; something Momo knows, but has trouble dealing with, as people are more apt to believe in Sae than the &#x27;airheaded ganguro girl&#x27; to the point that Toji believed Sae over Momo (who was currently his girlfriend). She often uses the gossip to make people dislike Momo, as a result of her own jealousy and insecurity. She spreads rumors that she is dating Toji, and that Momo is trying to steal him from her when it is actually the other way around. She really is mean and doesn&#x27;t care for Momo and isn&#x27;t her &quot;real&quot; friend. All she wants is popularity in school, to humiliate Momo, and to get Toji all for herself. She will stop at nothing to complete this task. Later, she dates a male model named Jigoro and in the end exploits him to help break up Toji and Momo, the nastiest scheme she has ever plotted. She begins to repent after she falls in love with Ryo and understands the hurtful feeling that she caused Momo, when Ryo seemingly gets her pregnant (it later turns out to be a medical condition that simulates pregnancy) and subsequently abandons her.
:The entire reason Sae ruins Momo&#x27;s life by lying, is that fact she can&#x27;t accept someone doesn&#x27;t have secrets and is genuinely kind; due to suffering betrayal of that kind in her childhood.
:
:Played by: Kei Inoo (Live Action 2017)
: A popular and carefree classmate of Momo&#x27;s. Sae goes after him after Momo lies that she likes him to protect her and Toji&#x27;s relationship, but he is the only boy to see straight through Sae for what she really is. He has the reputation of being a playboy, something he is not exactly proud of. He thought that Momo was the one who once gave him CPR when he had nearly drowned at the beach when they were younger; only to later find out he had been saved by the local male lifeguard. His interest in her is renewed when Sae spreads rumors about them being a couple; he adds to this by claiming he has kissed Momo. When Momo is upset by his rumor, he tries to make the rumor true by kissing her unexpectedly in the beginning of the series.

: After the two start dating, his insecurities about relationships are revealed to stem from his unrequited love for Misao, the school nurse and Kairi&#x27;s former tutor. However, after he confesses and is shot down by her, he actually feels relieved and confident to pursue his relationship with Momo. He begins fighting over her with Toji and in the end they get back together.

The English-language manga uses the non standard romanization &quot;Kiley Okayasu&quot;. Other groups, such as FUNimation, Kodansha Japan, and non-English language publishers, use &quot;Kairi&quot;. The English version of &quot;Peach Girl NEXT&quot; uses Kairi.
:
:Played by: Mackenyu (Live Action 2017)
A boy who has been Momo&#x27;s crush since junior high school although she never then confessed to him due to a friend saying he &quot;doesn&#x27;t like girls with tan skin&quot;. He overhears Momo confess her love for him to Kairi and then eventually dates Momo but Sae wants him for herself. He has a good heart, but tends to be hard headed and oblivious to what is in front of him, believing what Sae says over what Momo says, much to the frustration of Momo. Sae later blackmails Toji into dating her using pictures of Momo and Jigoro in a hotel bed together. He then breaks up with Momo. After this Momo starts dating Kairi.

The Tokyopop manga renders his family name as &quot;Toujikamori&quot;.
:
:Played by: Yuika Motokariya (Live Action 2017)

The school nurse and a big sister figure for Momo. Misao was once Kairi&#x27;s tutor and crush, and an old flame of Ryo&#x27;s. Although she dated and broke up with him, she still loves him.
:
:Played by: Kensei Mikami (Live Action 2017)
: Kairi&#x27;s older brother who works in the video game industry. He serves as a male counterpart to Sae, only he is significantly more dangerous. Ryo is in love with Misao, and dated her briefly, but Misao broke up with him because of his cold and manipulating attitude which is revealed when he smacks Sae after hurting Misao.

: Sae meets him and quickly falls for him because of their obvious similarities, though Ryo barely takes the relationship seriously and treats Sae poorly. When Sae tells him she is pregnant with his child he gives her money. Ryo is quite touched by Sae when she tells him she wants to make a family with him that will love him. After they find out Sae had a false pregnancy, the two split. However, Ryo stills feels happy about what Sae told him, and seems to be interested in having kids.
:
:Played by: Daisuke Kikuta (Live Action 2017)
: He is called and is a male model who is smitten with Sae and unaware of her true personality. She uses him in her schemes against Momo.
:
: A young woman who once dated both Okayasu brothers, Morika has a grudge against Ryo and tries to use Kairi against him. Morika hires some thugs to beat up Ryo as revenge for using her.

Dee died on June 11, 2014, at her home in New Rochelle, New York, from natural causes at the age of 91. In a statement, Gil Robertson IV of the African-American Film Critics Association said, &quot;the members of the African American Film Critics Association are deeply saddened at the loss of actress and humanitarian Ruby Dee. Throughout her seven-decade career, Dee embraced different creative platforms with her various interpretations of black womanhood and also used her gifts to champion for Human Rights.&quot;

&quot;She very peacefully surrendered&quot;, said her daughter Nora Day. &quot;We hugged her, we kissed her, we gave her our permission to go. She opened her eyes. She looked at us. She closed her eyes, and she set sail.&quot; Following her death, the marquee on the Apollo Theater read: &quot;A TRUE APOLLO LEGEND RUBY DEE 1922–2014&quot;.

Dee was cremated, and her ashes are held in the same urn as that of Davis, with the inscription &quot;In this thing together&quot;. A public memorial celebration honoring Dee was held on September 20, 2014, at the Riverside Church in Upper Manhattan. Their shared urn was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

<doc id="1296308" wikidata="Q4731490" url="?curid=1296308" title="Allen &amp; Ginter">
<text>Allen &amp; Ginter was a Richmond, Virginia, tobacco manufacturing company formed by John F. Allen and Lewis Ginter around 1880. The firm created and marketed the first cigarette cards for collecting and trading in the United States. Some of the notable cards in the series include baseball players Charles Comiskey, Cap Anson, and Jack Glasscock, as well as non-athletes like Buffalo Bill Cody.

The company merged with four other tobacco manufacturers to form the American Tobacco Company in 1890. Since 2006, a revived version of the brand has been issued by Topps for a line of baseball cards.

==History==
===Tobacco manufacturing===
The firm of Allen &amp; Ginter, born around 1880, was the rebranding of John F. Allen &amp; Company, a partnership formed about eight years earlier by John F. Allen and Lewis Ginter. When Allen retired in 1882, Ginter took on John Pope as his new partner but kept Allen&#x27;s name. The first tobacco company to employ female labor, by 1886 they had 1,100 employees, predominantly girls, who rolled the cigarettes.

Around 1876, the company offered a prize for the invention of a machine able to roll cigarettes (which until then had been hand-rolled). In 1880, James Albert Bonsack of Virginia invented a cigarette rolling machine. Because it was not completely reliable, all but one of the large tobacco manufacturers declined to buy the machine. James Buchanan Duke did buy this cigarette rolling machine in 1885 and used it to great success; by 1890 he had consolidated his four major competitors, including Allen &amp; Ginter, and formed the American Tobacco Company. The &quot;Allen &amp; Ginter Company&quot; was no more, but Lewis Ginter sat on the board of the American Tobacco Company.

The cigarette brands of Allen &amp; Ginter included Richmond Gems, Virginia Brights, Perfection, Dandies and Little Beauties.

In 1890, Allen &amp; Ginter, along with other companies of the United States (W. Duke &amp; Sons, W.S. Kimball &amp; Company, Kinney Tobacco, and Goodwin &amp; Company) formed the American Tobacco Company, in an attempt to compete against British tobacco companies.

===Collectible cards===
In late 1880s, Allen &amp; Ginter began to release cigarette card sets as stiffeners for the tobacco package and promotional items for its cigarette brands. The most part of the collection consisted of illustrated cards, but there were a few collections of photographs. Topics varied from birds and wild animals to American Indian chiefs or flags of the world. Allen &amp; Ginter&#x27;s baseball cards were the first of the tobacco era baseball cards ever produced for distribution on a national level. The most popular and highly sought after of these sets is the N28 and N29 &quot;World&#x27;s Champions&quot; series, released in 1887.

In 1887, Allen &amp; Ginter released its iconic &quot;World&#x27;s Champions&quot; set, featuring not only baseball players but also athletes from various sports and notable public figures. These cards were illustrated, featuring vibrant chromolithographic printing.

Players like Cap Anson and King Kelly became some of the earliest sports celebrities, immortalized through Allen &amp; Ginter’s cards. Allen &amp; Ginter&#x27;s influence extended beyond just baseball, inspiring future tobacco companies and card manufacturers to produce similar sets. Today, Allen &amp; Ginter&#x27;s cards are highly valued among collectors for their historical significance and artistry.

===Modern era===

In 2006, Topps, a leading producer of confectionery and trading cards, resurrected the Allen &amp; Ginter brand name to produce a series of illustrated trading cards, mostly focused on baseball sets. Nevertheless, the first couple of years of the product&#x27;s inception saw the inclusion of several other sports figures such as Jennie Finch (softball), Brandi Chastain and Mia Hamm (soccer), Hulk Hogan (wrestling), Danica Patrick (auto racing), Leon Spinks (boxing), Randy Couture (mixed martial arts), Misty May-Treanor (beach volleyball) and Dennis Rodman (basketball).

Allen &amp; Ginter cards began to feature hand-painted cards of current baseball players as well as various insert sets featuring standout athletes in other sports, pop culture icons, and historical figures ranging from Wee-Man to Davy Crockett and everything in between.

Non-sports trading cards issued by Topps included personalities such as Robert E. Lee, Thomas Edison, Billy the Kid and Andrew Carnegie, Davy Crockett, among others.

From 2006 to 2009, artist Dick Perez was commissioned to hand paint special one of one insert cards in the style of Allen &amp; Ginter. Perez created 30 art cards each of those years featuring the prominent stars of the game.

As of 2012 the Allen &amp; Ginter series remains one of Topps&#x27; most popular, highest selling brands in their product lineup.

The best known of the Allen &amp; Ginter insert sets however, are the DNA Hair Relic cards. These highly lauded cards feature strands of hair from famous historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, King George III, George Washington and many others.

Another popular feature of the Allen &amp; Ginter product is the Rip Card. Invented by hobby shop owner and Topps consultant Alan Narz, Rip Cards have been a part of every Allen &amp; Ginter product since 2006. These cards allow collectors to keep the card intact or to rip the outer card to reveal an exclusive mini card available only inside of a Rip Card. These mini cards may be short prints, autographs, or cards made from metal or wood. Beginning in 2013, Topps began including a Double Rip Card, which had two inner cavities with mini cards inside. In 2019, Topps introduced a jumbo Box Topper Rip Card, with 3 mini cards inside.

==Trading cards series==
There were various cigarette card sets released as promotional items for these products. The most popular and highly sought after of these sets is the N28 and N29 &quot;World&#x27;s Champions&quot; series, released in 1887.

<doc id="1296312" wikidata="Q2041604" url="?curid=1296312" title="Torpex">
<text>Torpex (&quot;Torpedo explosive&quot;) is a secondary explosive, 50% more powerful than TNT by mass. Torpex comprises 42% RDX, 40% TNT and 18% powdered aluminium. It was used in the Second World War from late 1942, at which time some used the names Torpex and RDX interchangeably, much to the confusion of today&#x27;s historical researchers. Torpex proved to be particularly useful in underwater munitions because the aluminium component made the explosive pulse last longer, which increased the destructive power. Besides torpedoes, naval mines, and depth charges, Torpex was only used in the Upkeep, Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs as well as the drones employed in Operation Aphrodite. Torpex has long been superseded by H6 and Polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) compositions. It is regarded as obsolete and Torpex is unlikely to be encountered except in old munitions or unexploded ordnance, although a notable exception to this is the Sting Ray lightweight torpedo, which as of October 2020 remains in service with the Royal Navy and several foreign militaries. The German equivalent of Torpex was Trialen.

==Development==
Torpex was developed at the Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey, in the United Kingdom as a more powerful military alternative to TNT. RDX was developed in 1899. Though very stable and serving as the reference point by which the sensitivity of other explosives are judged, it was too expensive for most military applications and reserved for use in the most important products, such as torpedoes. Aluminium powder was also added to the mix to further enhance the effect. Although both RDX and TNT have a negative oxygen balance, the superheated aluminium component tends to contribute primarily by extending the expansion time of the explosive product gases. Beeswax was also added as a phlegmatizing agent, to reduce sensitivity to shock and impact. Later, beeswax was replaced with paraffin wax, and calcium chloride was added as a moisture absorber to reduce the production of hydrogen gas under high humidity.

The production of RDX in the USA skyrocketed following the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. In April 1942, 100 tons of Composition C (88% RDX and oil desensitizer), also known as C4, was ordered by the Office of Strategic Services. By 8 May 1945 (Victory in Europe Day) the Holston Ordnance Works had been in full production of RDX with no end in sight. In July of that year government officials informed the plant to not exceed production quotas (as had been the practice to that point) since they knew that the atomic bomb was near completion.

<text>Ginter Park is a suburban neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia built on land owned and developed by Lewis Ginter. The neighborhood&#x27;s first well known resident was newspaperman Joseph Bryan, who lived in Laburnum, first built in 1883 and later rebuilt. In 1895, many acres of land north of Richmond were purchased by Ginter in order to develop into neighborhoods. Ginter Park and other neighborhoods were developed from this initial land purchase. In Ginter Park are Union Presbyterian Seminary and as well as Pollard Park.

Nearby are the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Richmond and John Marshall High School.

While the borders of North Side are not exact, nearby North Side neighborhoods include Barton Heights, Highland Park, Laburnum Park, Sherwood Park and Bellevue.

The Ginter Park Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It encompasses 291 contributing buildings and 179 contributing structures.

<text>Karl Eduard von Holtei (24 January 1798 – 12 February 1880) was a German poet and actor.

==Life and career==

Karl Eduard von Holtei was born at Breslau, the son of an officer of Hussars. Having served in the Prussian army as a volunteer in 1815, he shortly afterwards entered the University of Breslau as a student of law; but, attracted by the stage, he soon forsook academic life and made his debut in the Breslau theatre as Mortimer in Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuart&quot;. He led a wandering life for the next two years, appearing less on the stage as an actor than as a reciter of his own poems. In 1821 he married the actress Luise Roge (1800-1825), and was appointed theatre-poet to the Breslau stage. He next removed to Berlin, where his wife fulfilled an engagement at the Court theatre. During his sojourn here he produced the vaudevilles &quot;Die Wiener in Berlin&quot; (1824), and &quot;Die Berliner in Wien&quot; (1825), pieces which enjoyed at the time great popular favour.

In 1825 his wife died; but soon after her death he accepted an engagement at the Königsstädter theatre in Berlin, when he wrote a number of plays, notably &quot;Lenore&quot; (1828), based on Gottfried August Bürger&#x27;s ballad, and &quot;Der alte Feldherr&quot; (1825). In 1830 he married Julie Holzbecher (1809-1839), an actress engaged at the same theatre, and with her played in Darmstadt. Returning to Berlin in 1831 he wrote for the composer Franz Gläser (1798-1861) the text of the opera &quot;Des Adlers Horst&quot; (1832), and for Ludwig Devrient the drama, &quot;Der dumme Peter&quot; (1837).

In 1833 Holtei again went on the stage and toured with his wife to various important cities, Hamburg, Leipzig, Dresden, Munich and Vienna. In the last his declamatory powers as a reciter, particularly of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, made a furore, and the poet-actor was given the appointment of manager of the Josefstädter theatre in the last-named city. Though proud of his successes both as actor and reciter, Holtei left Vienna in 1836, and from 1837 to 1839 conducted the theatre in Riga. Here his second wife died, and after wandering through Germany reciting and accepting a short engagement at Breslau, he settled in 1847 at Graz, where he devoted himself to a literary life and produced the novels &quot;Die Vagabunden&quot; (1851), &quot;Christian Lammfell&quot; (1853) and &quot;Der letzte Komödiant&quot; (1863). The last years of his life were spent at Breslau, where being in poor circumstances he found a home in the Kloster der Barmherzigen Brüder, and here he died.
As a dramatist Holtei may be said to have introduced the vaudeville into Germany; as an actor, although remaining behind the greater artists of his time, he contrived to fascinate his audience by the dramatic force of his exposition of character as a reciter, especially of Shakespeare, he knew no rival. August Lewald said of Holtei that by the energy of his poetic conception and plastic force he brought his audience round to his own ideas; and he added, &quot;an eloquence such as his I have never met with in any other German.&quot;

Holtei was not only a stage-poet but, a lyric-writer of great charm. Notable among such productions are &quot;Schlesische Gedichte&quot; (1830; 20th edition, 1893), &quot;Gedichte&quot; (5th edition, 1861), &quot;Stimmen des Waldes&quot; (2nd edition, 1854). Mention ought also to be made of Holtei&#x27;s interesting autobiography, &quot;Vierzig Jahre&quot; (8 vols., 1843-1850; 3rd edition, 1862) with the supplementary volume &quot;Noch ein Jahr in Schlesien&quot; (1864).

Holtei&#x27;s &quot;Theater&quot; appeared in 6 volumes (1867); his &quot;Erzählende Schriften&quot;, 39 volumes (1861-1866).

<text>&quot;Only You (And You Alone)&quot; (often shortened to &quot;Only You&quot;) is a doo wop song composed by Buck Ram, the manager of the Platters, the group that made the song famous in the US, the UK and Belgium. The Platters&#x27;s lead vocals are by Tony Williams. 

Other well-known versions have been recorded by the Hilltoppers, Franck Pourcel and Ringo Starr. American country music versions were released by Travis Tritt, Reba McEntire, Bobby Hatfield and the Statler Brothers. In the UK, the most widely heard versions are the ones by the Platters, Ringo Starr, the band Child and the actor John Alford. In Norway, a version by Stein Ingebrigtsen charted in the Norwegian language. American singer Brenda Lee scored a hit in Belgium with her version.

==The Platters versions==
The Platters first recorded the song for Federal Records on May 20, 1954, but the recording was not released. In 1955, after moving to Mercury Records, the band re-recorded the song (on April 26) and it scored a major hit when it was released in May. In November that year, Federal Records released the original recording as a single (B-side - &quot;You Made Me Cry&quot;) which sold poorly.

Platters bass singer Herb Reed recalled how the group hit upon its successful version: &quot;We tried it so many times, and it was terrible. One time we were rehearsing in the car... and the car jerked. Tony went &#x27;O-oHHHH-nly you.&#x27; We laughed at first, but when he sang that song—that was the sign we had hit on something.&quot; According to Buck Ram, Tony Williams&#x27; voice &quot;broke&quot; in rehearsal, but they decided to keep this effect in the recording. This was the only Platters recording on which songwriter and manager Ram played the piano.

The song held strong in the number 1 position on the U.S. R &amp; B charts for seven weeks, and hit number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart. It remained on the charts for 30 weeks, beating out a rival cover version by the Hilltoppers. When the Platters track, &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; (which eventually surpassed the success of &quot;Only You&quot;), was released in the UK as Europe&#x27;s first introduction to the group, &quot;Only You&quot; was included on the B-side. In the 1956 film &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, the Platters participated with both songs.

The Platters re-recorded a slightly longer version of the song for Musicor Records in 1966, which features on the album &quot;I Love You 1,000 Times&quot; (MM 2091).

In 1999, the 1955 recording on Mercury Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

=== Charts ===
==The Hilltoppers version==
The Hilltoppers released their version of the song as a Dot Records single in 1955. It reached number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 3 in the UK.

==Franck Pourcel version==
An instrumental version by Franck Pourcel was a hit single in 1959, and sold more than 5 million copies. Pourcel&#x27;s version spent 16 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number 9, while reaching number 3 on Canada&#x27;s CHUM Hit Parade, and number 18 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B Sides.

==Ringo Starr version==
In 1974, Ringo Starr covered this song for his album &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot; at the suggestion of John Lennon. This version was released as a single (b/w &quot;Call Me&quot;) on 11 November in the US, and it became a number six hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; best seller chart and reached number one on the Easy Listening chart in early 1975. In Canada, the song also reached number one on the &quot;RPM&quot; middle-of-the-road chart and number 17 on the top singles chart within the same period. It was released in the UK on 15 November. Lennon plays acoustic guitar on the track, and recorded a guide vocal which was kept by producer Richard Perry. Harry Nilsson sings harmony vocals and appears with Starr in the amusing music video filmed on top of the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles. Lennon&#x27;s vocal version appears on his &quot;Anthology&quot; box set, in 1998.

<doc id="1296349" wikidata="Q12071401" url="?curid=1296349" title="Transport in Bucharest">
<text>Bucharest has the largest transport network in Romania, and one of the largest in Europe. The Bucharest transport network is made up of a metro network and a surface transport network. Although there are multiple connection points, the two systems operate independently of each other, and are run by different organisations (the metro is run by Metrorex and the surface transport network by Bucharest-Ilfov Intercommunity Development Association for Public Transport. The two companies used separate ticketing systems until 2021, when a new smartcard was introduced alongside the old tickets, which allows travel on both the TPBI and the Underground.

==Bucharest Metro==

Bucharest has a fairly extensive metro system consisting of five lines (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5) ran by Metrorex. In total, the network is long and has 64 stations, with average distance between stops. It is one of the fastest ways to get around the city. The oldest metro line is M1, which was opened in 1979. The newest metro line is M5, which was opened in 2020. A sixth metro line, M6 line, is currently under construction.

==Surface transport==
Surface transport in Bucharest is run by Bucharest-Ilfov Intercommunity Development Association for Public Transport (TPBI) and it is operated by Societatea de Transport București (STB), Societatea de Transport Voluntari (STV), a.o..

TPBI consists of an extensive network of buses, trolleybuses, trams and light rail. The TPBI network is one of the densest in Europe, and the fourth largest on the continent, carrying about 1.7 million passengers daily on 85 bus lines, 23 tram lines, 2 light rail lines and 15 trolleybus lines. At times, however, it suffers from severe overcrowding.

TPBI is a reasonably efficient and a very frequently-used way of getting around Bucharest. As with the metro, the system is undergoing a period of renewal. Some new features are the upgrade of tram/trolleybus infrastructure and the replacement of old rolling stock.

===Buses===

With a total route length of , the TPBI urban bus network is the densest of all the transport types in Bucharest. There are 85 bus lines (plus 25 night routes) operating mostly in the municipality of Bucharest, as well as over 39 bus lines serving commuters from surrounding towns and villages in Ilfov County. In mid-2005, the lines that linked the city to the peripheral area were licensed out to independent transportation providers, but in early 2006, they were returned to STB control due to a wide range customer complaints about the private operators. Sometime in 2010, all the STB lines of the peripheral network were removed, leading to an increase in minivans owned by private transport companies, and so far only a few of these lines have been put back.

In 2017 was founded Bucharest-Ilfov Intercommunity Development Association for Public Transport, and with that STV took over most of the peripheral bus routes.

====Fleet====
The main public transport operator in Bucharest ( STB ) has a bus fleet made up of 1,143 vehicles (2018), which are all wheelchair-accessible (low floor) and around 55% are air-conditioned. The fleet utilisation rate during workdays stood at 78.1% in 2018.

Between 2005 and 2009, the fleet underwent its most substantial renewal since 1989, and is now among the most modern in Europe. In December 2005, STB signed a contract for 500 Mercedes Citaro low-floor, wheelchair-accessible buses. The buses were delivered between June 2006 and April 2007. In January 2008, the first of a further series of 500 Citaro low-floor buses were put into service.

The fleet makeup, as of 2019, is as follows, with years of delivery shown in brackets:
Central Lines are usually populated by Electric and Hybrid buses, while lines connecting residential areas tend to use the Otokar and Mercedes Citaro buses.

===Trolleybuses===
Trolleybuses supplement buses on the TPBI system network, which operates 15 trolleybus lines (mainly on high-usage routes), measuring of routes on network. During the 1990s, the fleet was updated with modern trolleybuses manufactured by Ikarus, in light blue and yellow livery, which have acoustic station announcements and digital display screens. 

In early 2007, 100 wheelchair-accessible Irisbus Citelis trolleybuses were introduced on routes 61, 62, 69, 70, 86, 90, 91, and 92.

Two distinct, non-interconnected networks exist in Bucharest, the main network (comprising the two main east–west lines as well as a spur in the northern part of town) and a relatively small southern network in Berceni. Each of the networks has its own, separate trolleybus depots (including separate fleets) and is not connected to the other in any way, in 1987 being separated after the opening of M2 metro line. The trolleybus network is currently being overhauled or expanded — a goal is to eventually unite the two networks.

The newer fleet of Solaris Trollino 12 trolleybuses is used to convert diesel bus routes to trolleybus routes (Eg.: Bus route 133 became part of Trolleybus route 97).

====Fleet====
In 2022, the STB had a fleet of 265 trolleybuses spread across 3 depots and 1 mixed tram-trolleybus depot. Most of them were Astra-Ikarus 415T (163 trolleybuses). The fleet utilisation rate during workdays stood at 67.66% in 2022.
In 2024, the STB started receiving 100 Solaris Trollino 12 trolleybuses.
===Trams and light rail===
STB operates a complex system of trams measuring of routes on of lines throughout Bucharest. In addition to 23 tram lines, there are two converted light rail lines called &quot;metrou uşor&quot; (&quot;light metro&quot;), numbered 41 , which serve the western and south-western parts of Bucharest. This line has upgraded trams running on separate designated corridors for faster travel times.

67% of the city&#x27;s tram infrastructure had been modernised by 2018. The light rail service is expected to be expanded by upgrading existing tram lines to light rail status.

Most trams operated by STB (all V3A, Bucur 1 and Bucur LF models) are manufactured internally by STB at their subsidiary URAC Bucharest (the same subsidiary also handles tramway repairs and is in charge of scrapping vehicles reaching the end of their useful life). Currently, URAC produces three models for STB – two three-section, partially low-floor, wheelchair-accessible models (V3A-CH-PPC/CA-PPC derived from the earlier V3A-93 model and the all-new Bucur-LF model) as well as a two-section, non-wheelchair-accessible model (Bucur 1), made from scrapped Tatra axles with new equipment. It is uncertain if their production will continue, because as of now their production has been halted for the past 7 years.

Routes 1, 7, 10, 11, 21, 25, 32, 41 are wheelchair-accessible, using new Astra Imperio Metropolitan, V3A-93-PPC, V3A-CH-PPC/V3A-CA-PPC or Bucur LF trams. Lines 14, 16/17 (17 is an off-days variant of line 16), 19, 23, 27, 40, 42, 44, 47, 53 and 55 are also wheel chair accessible when V3A-93-PPC (number is limited to 8 vehicles at this moment, 008, 164, 169, 181, 206, 227, 303 and 343 can be seen on these routes occasionally, or CA/CH-PPC are sent on these routes. Other routes (if most) will become wheelchair-accessible as soon as more V3A-PPC will undergo reparations or modernisations, or even buy more new tramsets (is it planned an acquisition of 250 trams, of different lengths).

The maximum speed of trams in Bucharest is .

====Fleet====
In 2018, the STB had a fleet of 486 trams, most of which were the V3A-M type (323 trams). The fleet is spread across 7 tram depots and 1 mixed tram-trolleybus depot. The fleet utilisation rate during workdays stood at 55.6% in 2018. In December 2022, the first 15 Astra Imperio Metropolitan trams (out of a total order of 100 units) were put into circulation.
== Tickets ==
Surface transportation, operated by STB uses a different ticketing system from the metro network, operated by Metrorex, a separate entity. Their tickets and prices can be found on their website, available in English as well. http://www.stb.ro/

They include subscriptions, rechargeable cards as well as single use cards. A simple metropolitan ticket valid on all surface lines for 90 minutes costs 3 RON and can be activated by tapping either a STB transit card or a contactless bank card on the ticket machines present inside all vehicles. Tickets can also be bought through SMS by sending a message to 7458, with the message &quot;C&quot;, you will be charged 0.65 EUR + VAT. You can also purchase a 24-hour pass for 8 RON at any kiosk or by sending the message &quot;AB&quot; to the same number, costing you 1.5 EUR + VAT.

This method of SMS-based payment is also available through the app, InfoTB. The app can also plan routes using all types of transportation in the city, and show the GPS location of vehicles. Approximately 85% of vehicles are equipped with a GPS positioning system.

A separate app, 24Pay, can be used to pay for fares using a credit card.

An online account can also be created on the website, that allows clients to add credit to their STB cards.

BCR (Romanian Commercial Bank) ATMs also allow clients to recharge their physical cards with money.

Metrorex and STB have integrated tickets and passes, information which is available on their websites, but also on the Bucharest Metro page. An integrated fare costs 5 RON and can be used simultaneously on both surface lines and the metro, with a time limit of 120 minutes.

The Bucharest Metro uses a per-entry constant fare system, every entry costing 3 RON, regardless of stations travelled, time spent or zones used, changing lines doesn&#x27;t require additional pay and is free, the only exception is Gara De Nord, where the 2 corresponding stations are separate and thus you are required to exit the system and pay again at the other station to transfer lines, tho free transfers from the M1 to the M4 can be done at the neighbouring Basarb station.

Passengers can purchase paper tickets loaded with 1, 2 or 10 fares or simply tap their contactless bank cards at the turnstiles, which will charge them 3 RON. Rechargeable contactless metro cards can also be issued and loaded with passes available for either a day, a week, a month or a year. The most commonly used pass is the 1 month pass priced at 80 RON.

===Personal cars===
At the end of 2008, in Bucharest there were 1.24 million vehicles, of which 985.000 were personal cars. In 2007 there were 150.000 fewer vehicles, which means the number of vehicles increased by 13.76% in one year.

With so many cars and a very high population density (50% higher than Tokyo and 4 times bigger than Rome for example), parking is a problem in Bucharest.
==CFR Trains==

In 2011, Bucharest had 99 km of railway lines, 79 of which were electric.

Bucharest has several train stations throughout and around the city, the main one being Gara de Nord where trains depart to all destinations. Other main stations include Baneasa, Obor and Basarab.

Gara de Nord is a relatively modern station. It was opened in 1872 and has undergone modernization and refurbishment several times. From here, trains leave to every destination in Romania and to other European cities. The other stations only see around five trains a day and are not considered &quot;important&quot; stations by CFR.

Bucharest was once home to a vast system of industrial railways that sprawled all over the city, linking factories to the surrounding neighbourhoods and towns. However most of these are now gone and what remains has fallen into disrepair. Therefore, Bucharest doesn&#x27;t have an RER/S-Bahn type of commuter network. Attempts have been made in the past to introduce such a system, but so far not much has been achieved. It is true that there are trains operated by CFR from Bucharest to neighbouring towns, however due to long journey times and poor rolling stock most people tend to use personal cars to get into the city.

==Road network==

The city&#x27;s municipal road network is centred on a series of high-capacity boulevards (6 to 10 lanes), which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts and are arranged in geographical axes (principally north–south, east–west and northwest–southeast). The principal and thus most congested boulevards are Calea Victoriei, Bulevardul Unirii and Șoseaua Mihai Bravu, which is the longest in Bucharest and forms a sort of semicircle around the northeastern part of the old district. The city also has two ring roads, one internal (Mihai Bravu is part of it) and one external, which are mainly used for cars that bypass the city as well as trucks, which aren&#x27;t allowed in the city centre, Works on a third ring road (the A0), which would be mainly used for transit and freight traffic around the city, began in 2020 on some segments. Aside from the main roads, the city also has a number of secondary roads, which connect the main boulevards. In the historical city centre, particularly the Lipscani area, many streets are cobbled and are classified as pedestrian zones.

The city&#x27;s roads are usually very crowded during rush hours, due to an increase in car ownership in recent years. Every day, there are more than one million vehicles travelling within the city limits. This has resulted in wearing of the upper layer of tarmac on many of roads in Bucharest, particularly secondary roads which are now used in an equal amount, this being identified as one of Bucharest&#x27;s main infrastructural problems. The pothole problem is notorious enough to have inspired a song by the band Taxi with a chorus &quot;Cratere ca-n București, nici pe luna nu gaseşti!&quot; (&quot;Craters like in Bucharest you won&#x27;t even find on the moon&quot;). However, in recent years, there has been a comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost improvement of road infrastructure, mainly by resurfacing and widening roads, and repairing footpaths. Faulty urban planning will likely lead to an increase in traffic and parking problems, since new housing areas are built with houses and apartment buildings literally squeezed into existing small grid roads, a problem commonly identified in the &quot;suburbs&quot; of the city.

Bucharest is one of the principal junctions of Romania&#x27;s national road network, which links the city to all of Romania&#x27;s major cities as well as to neighbouring countries such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine. Furthermore, the city is the starting point of the A1 motorway, towards Pitești, the A2, linking the capital with the country&#x27;s ports and seaside resorts on the Black Sea and the A3, towards Ploiești.

==Airports==

Bucharest has one international airport: 
* Henri Coandă International Airport, located north of the Bucharest metropolitan area, in the town of Otopeni, Ilfov. Currently the airport has one terminal divided into three inter-connected buildings (International Departures Hall, International Arrivals Hall and the Domestic Flights Hall – at the ground level of the Arrivals Hall). The International Departures Hall consists of 36 check-in desks, one finger with 10 gates (5 equipped with jetways), while the Domestic Hall has an extra four gates. Today&#x27;s International Arrivals Hall is the old Otopeni terminal, while the new Departures Hall, including the finger and the airbridges was built and inaugurated in 1997. A second finger with 7 jetways is under construction and a new building terminal on the east side is in project phase. The airport received 8,317,168 passengers in 2015. It is accessible by STB buses 100 and the future M6 underground line, which will link the airport with the main train station of Bucharest.
Until 2012 there was also another airport which is no longer used, except for charter/private flights:
*Aurel Vlaicu International Airport is situated only 8 km north of the Bucharest city centre and is accessible by STB buses 100, 131, 330, 335, tram line 5 (temporarily closed, replaced by 605) and taxi.

==Water transport==

Although it is situated on the banks of a river, Bucharest has never functioned as a port city, with other Romanian cities such as Constanţa and Brăila acting as the country&#x27;s main ports. However, the Danube-Bucharest Canal, which is 73 km long, was under construction until 1990 and is not being worked on as of 2015. When eventually finished, the canal will link Bucharest to the Danube River and, via the Danube-Black Sea Canal, to the Black Sea. This transport corridor is expected to be a significant component of the city&#x27;s transport infrastructure and increase sea traffic by a large margin.

<text>Senshu Ikeda Bank, Ltd. (&quot;Senshu Ikeda Ginkō&quot;; 池田泉州銀行) is a Japanese regional bank. Headquartered in Kishiwada, Osaka, it has 139 branches. On May 1, 2010, Senshu Bank merged with the Ikeda Bank to become the Senshu Ikeda Bank.

== History ==
Senshu Bank was founded in January 1951 and was involved in loaning, credit cards, leasing, and the development and sale of computer software. It was traded on the Osaka Securities Exchange under symbol 8372. Its primary shareholders were Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

Ikeda Bank was established in September 1951, with its headquarters in Ikeda. It was the &quot;surviving&quot; institution in the merger.

<doc id="1296373" wikidata="Q4272860" url="?curid=1296373" title="USS Sterett (DD-27)">
<text>USS &quot;Sterett&quot; (DD-27) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first ship named for Andrew Sterett.

&quot;Sterett&quot; was laid down on 22 March 1909 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company. Sponsored by Miss Dorothy Rosalie Sterett Gittings, the destroyer was launched on 12 May 1910 and commissioned on 15 December 1910 at Boston, Massachusetts.

==Pre-World War I==
Each year until 1913, &quot;Sterett&quot; operated along the east coast out of Boston from April to December and, from January to April, participated in training and battle exercises out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Though placed in reserve on 5 November 1913, she continued duty with the torpedo fleet. On 20 January 1914, she sailed from Charleston, South Carolina, and reached New Orleans, Louisiana, on 2 March, after stops at Cape Canaveral, Miami, Key West, Florida, and at Mobile, Alabama. The following day, she joined the newly created Reserve Torpedo Flotilla, operating in the Gulf of Mexico out of Galveston, Texas. In June, she returned to the Atlantic seaboard, this time based at Norfolk, Virginia, and resumed coastal patrols and Caribbean exercises. &quot;Sterett&quot;″s complement was reduced on 5 January 1916 and, throughout that spring; she operated almost exclusively in the Caribbean.

On 1 June, she was a part of the fleet which landed and supported the Marines at Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic, and marched to Santiago to restore order and to protect lives and property. Soon thereafter, &quot;Sterett&quot; returned to Norfolk and resumed operations along the east coast. On 1 January 1917, she entered the Mississippi, stopped at New Orleans, and steamed up river to Vicksburg, Mississippi. She reentered the gulf and patrolled the Texas coast until she was shifted to Key West on 18 March. From there, the destroyer ranged as far as the Cuban coast.

==World War I==
In April 1917, the United States entered World War I, and by 9 June, &quot;Sterett&quot; was in Queenstown, Ireland. Throughout the remainder of the war, she operated from Queenstown to meet convoys and conduct them to either Berehaven, Ireland, or to Devonport, England. At these points, British and French destroyers assumed responsibility for the last leg of the voyage. A little less than a year after her arrival at Queenstown, on 31 May 1918, &quot;Sterett&quot; was herding a convoy toward the rendezvous point when she came upon a surfaced U-boat. As &quot;Sterett&quot; closed, the submarine rapidly submerged. &quot;Sterett&quot; began dropping depth charges furiously, and air bubbles and oil soon appeared on the surface, indicating damage to the German raider.

After exhausting her supply of depth charges, &quot;Sterett&quot; pursued the enemy by the U-boat&#x27;s wake of bubbles and trail of oil, hoping to force her to exhaust her batteries and air supply. She continued the pursuit through the night, guided in the darkness only by the fumes of the sub&#x27;s leaking oil. Finally, at dawn, the destroyer&#x27;s persistence was rewarded. She sighted the U-boat on the surface about ahead. &quot;Sterett&quot; sliced through the waves at top speed seeking to ram the submarine, but the U-boat countered by swinging hard to port. &quot;Sterett&quot; passed within of the submarine and, as the U-boat attempted to dive, brought her guns to bear. However, without sufficient time to bracket their adversary, &quot;Sterett&quot;″s gunners watched helplessly as the submarine slid beneath the surface and escaped. For their dogged determination, the officers and men of &quot;Sterett&quot; received the commendation of the Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland.

The year 1918 brought with it an all-out effort on the part of the Central Powers to bring the war to a successful conclusion. The German Navy increased the intensity of its submarine operations in order to free Germany from the Allies&#x27; ever-tightening blockade. In response to this thrust, &quot;Sterett&quot; maintained a grueling schedule of convoy duty-a week or more at sea followed by a day or two in port. One of her new techniques, the use of airborne surveillance, presaged modern hunter-killer antisubmarine warfare.

==Inter-war period==
The Allies prevailed, however, and the Armistice, signed on 11 November, brought an end to &quot;Sterett&quot;″s strenuous duty; and, by 3 January 1919, she was back in the United States at Charleston. From there, she moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she was decommissioned on 9 December. On 9 March 1935, after a little more than 15 years of inactivity, &quot;Sterett&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. On 28 June, she was sold for scrapping to M. Black and Company of Norfolk, Virginia.

<doc id="1296378" wikidata="Q13582269" url="?curid=1296378" title="Dumb (Nirvana song)">
<text>&quot;Dumb&quot; is a song by the American rock band, Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist, Kurt Cobain. It is the sixth song on the band&#x27;s third and final studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;, released in September 1993.

In a 1993 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview, Cobain explained that the song was about people who lacked the intelligence to be unhappy, which he admitted he was &quot;at times&quot; envious of.

The &quot;In Utero&quot; version features a cello part, written and performed by Chicago musician Kera Schaley, a friend of the album&#x27;s producer, Steve Albini. Schaley never toured with the band, but all live versions of the song during the &quot;In Utero&quot; tour featured cello, performed by Lori Goldston during the American leg of the tour, and Melora Creager during the European leg.

Despite never being released as a single, &quot;Dumb&quot; reached number 37 on the US Alternative National Airplay chart, which was published by the &quot;Billboard&quot; sister publication, &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;. In October 2023, an animated music video for the song by RuffMercy was released on Nirvana&#x27;s official YouTube channel, to promote the 30th anniversary of &quot;In Utero&quot;.

==Early history==

&quot;Dumb&quot; was written by Cobain in the summer of 1990, as the band began to move away from the heavier grunge sound of their debut album, &quot;Bleach&quot;, towards more openly melodic, pop-influenced material. Two lyrics sheets for the song were published posthumously in &quot;Journals&quot; in November 2002, one under the working title of &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Dumb,&quot; with a note that the lyrics were &quot;Not Finished,&quot; and the titles of two songs by Scottish rock band the Vaselines, &quot;Molly&#x27;s Lips&quot; and &quot;Slushy,&quot; written under the title with no explanation. In a 2023 interview, Courtney Love stated that Cobain had written the song in just 20 minutes, during a trip to Amsterdam.

&quot;Dumb&quot; was debuted live on September 25, 1990, when Cobain performed a solo acoustic version on the &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; show, hosted by Calvin Johnson of the American rock band Beat Happening, on KAOS (FM) in Olympia, Washington. The first live version featuring the full band was at the Off Ramp Café in Seattle, Washington on November 25, 1990.

On September 3, 1991, the band recorded a version of the song, already featuring finished lyrics, during their second John Peel session for the BBC at Maida Vale Studios in London. The full session, which also featured versions of &quot;Drain You&quot; and &quot;Endless Nameless&quot; from their then-latest release, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, was produced by Dale Griffin, and first broadcast on November 3, 1991. &quot;Dumb&quot; and &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot; from this session were posthumously released on the Nirvana rarities box set, &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, in November 2004.

Three studio versions of &quot;Dumb&quot; were recorded by Jack Endino on October 26, 1992, at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington, but all were instrumental, as were all the other songs recorded during this session, except for one take of the eventual &quot;In Utero&quot; single, &quot;Rape Me&quot;. One of these instrumental takes was released on the 20th anniversary &quot;Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; editions of &quot;In Utero&quot; in September 2013.

==&quot;In Utero&quot;==

The final studio version of &quot;Dumb&quot; was recorded by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studios in Cannon Falls, Minnesota in February 1993, during the recording sessions for &quot;In Utero&quot;. The song&#x27;s guitar, bass and drums were recorded on February 15, the third day of the sessions. All vocals for the album were recorded by Cobain during a single session the following day. 

In a 2013 interview for the audio series &quot;Spotify Landmark&quot;, Albini recalled replacing drummer Dave Grohl&#x27;s bass drum on &quot;Dumb&quot; and &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; with a small one &quot;with a full-front head on it, so that it had a very sort of bouncy, jazzy sound, as opposed to the sort of more percussive, more hard rock sound on the rest of the record.&quot;

===Cello===

The &quot;In Utero&quot; recording of &quot;Dumb&quot; features cello by Kera Schaley, a friend of Albini&#x27;s who also played on the album&#x27;s second single and closing track, &quot;All Apologies,&quot; as well as an unreleased take of the eventual b-side, &quot;Marigold.&quot; As Schaley recalled in a 2010 interview with &quot;Swan Fungus&quot;, &quot;I went to the studio...and Steve played the song &#x27;Dumb&#x27; for me. I wrote a part for it and then Kurt came in and listened, told me what to leave out and what to keep. Then he asked me to play around with &#x27;All Apologies.&#x27;&quot; In 2023, she shared her recollection of hearing the song for the first time, telling &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; Brian Hiatt, &quot;I remember I heard &#x27;Dumb&#x27; and then when Kurt came in, I looked at him and I said, &#x27;This is a really beautiful song.&#x27; And I think he might’ve thought that was funny, but he was like, &#x27;Thank you.&#x27;&quot; According to Schaley, the final cello line for the song was recorded in about three takes.

==Post-&quot;In Utero&quot;==

Nirvana performed an acoustic version of the song during their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance on November 18, 1993 at Sony Music Studios in New York City. This version featured Pat Smear on second guitar and Lori Goldston on cello.

It was performed, alongside the &quot;In Utero&quot; song, &quot;Serve the Servants,&quot; at Nirvana&#x27;s final television appearance, on February 23, 1994 in Rome, Italy for the &quot;RAI&quot; television show, &quot;Tunnel&quot;. This version of the song featured Melora Creager on cello.

&quot;Dumb&quot; was performed for the final time live at Nirvana&#x27;s last concert, at Terminal Einz in Munich, Germany on March 1, 1994.

==Composition and lyrics==

===Music===
Journalist Gillian G. Gaar noted that &quot;Dumb&quot; was one of the few Nirvana songs to remain &quot;low-key from beginning to end,&quot; comparing it to the &quot;Bleach&quot; song, &quot;About a Girl.&quot; Like &quot;About a Girl,&quot; the song has been described as &quot;Beatlesesque.&quot; Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic called it &quot;a beautiful song. That&#x27;s a really good one. I like the BBC version of the song. It&#x27;s real raw, but still the beauty is strong. A sweet pop song.&quot;

Describing the &quot;In Utero&quot; version, John Mulvey of the &quot;NME&quot; wrote that the song &quot;broods and circles, with the aid of a cello, like a baroque parody of &#x27;Lithium&#x27;. Again and again it builds up and up, primed to explode into a moshing sweatfest of a chorus, and again and again it ducks away from that commercially lucrative macho bonding rite.&quot; Likewise, Jim Bevigilia of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; wrote that &quot;the recording of the song on &quot;In Utero&quot; is all coiled tension. Even though you expect Cobain’s guitar to come crashing through to break it, it never quite does. Instead, a cello runs counterpoint to the steady rhythm section of Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl and to the protagonist’s insistence that maybe he’s happy after all.&quot;

===Lyrics===

In a 1993 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Cobain explained that the song was &quot;just about people who&#x27;re easily amused, people who not only aren&#x27;t capable of progressing their intelligence but are totally happy watching 10 hours of television and really enjoy it. I&#x27;ve met a lot of dumb people. They have a shitty job, they may be totally lonely, they don&#x27;t have a girlfriend, they don&#x27;t have much of a social life, and yet, for some reason, they&#x27;re happy.&quot;

Though written before Cobain&#x27;s addiction to heroin, &quot;Dumb&quot; is also one of the few Nirvana songs to directly reference drug use, specifically inhalants. In Cobain&#x27;s unused liner notes for the song, he blamed &quot;all that supposedly unaddictive, harmless&quot; marijuana for harming his nerves and damaging his memory, saying it &quot;wasn&#x27;t ever strong enough&quot; which led him to &quot;climb the ladder&quot; to heroin.

In 2015, Kurt&#x27;s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, offered her own interpretation of the song in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying, &quot;I cry every time I hear that song. It&#x27;s a stripped-down version of Kurt&#x27;s perception of himself – of himself on drugs, off drugs, feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation.&quot;

==Release and reception==

Though never released as a single, &quot;Dumb&quot; has become a popular song on American alternative rock radio, and was played on European radio.
It was ranked at number 39 on WHFS&#x27;s top 100 played songs of 1994, number 41 on KROQ-FM’s top 100 played songs of 1994, number 56 on Q101&#x27;s top 100 played songs of 1994, and number 82 on 91X&#x27;s top 100 played songs of 1994. &quot;Dumb&quot; was also ranked at number 381 on Live 105&#x27;s Top 500 songs in 1994, as well as at number 266 on Live 105&#x27;s Top 300 Revolutionary songs in 1995, and also at number 220 on WHFS&#x27;s Top 500 songs of the 90s in 1999. The combined airplay in 1994 allowed the song to chart at number 37 on the US Alternative National Airplay chart which was published by &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;, a sister publication to &quot;Billboard&quot;.

In a 1993 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Cobain told journalist David Fricke that he wished he had put more songs like &quot;Dumb&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot; on previous Nirvana albums, saying that Nirvana had so far &quot;failed in showing the lighter, more dynamic side of our band.&quot;

===Critical reception===

In his review of &quot;In Utero&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Fricke cited &quot;Dumb,&quot; along with &quot;Heart-Shaped Box,&quot; as evidence that if Generation X &quot;is ever going to have its own Lennon — someone who genuinely believes in rock &amp; roll salvation but doesn&#x27;t confuse mere catharsis with true deliverance — Cobain is damn near it.&quot; Reviewing the album for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Phil Alexander wrote that &quot;Kurt kickstarts Rape Me with a familiar and doubtlessly intended ...Teen Spirit shuffle, while Dumb has an infectious Come As You Are feel. Both ripple with Kurt&#x27;s poignant observations, allowing fleeting glimpses at his anger and frustration without ever resorting to the trite and obvious.&quot;

===Legacy===

Reviewing the band&#x27;s first greatest hits album, &quot;Nirvana&quot;, in 2002, Will Bryant of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;Dumb&quot; was &quot;one of Cobain&#x27;s most underrated efforts, a populist revision of &quot;Lithium&quot; that replaces &quot;Nevermind&#x27;s&quot; misanthropy with earnest self-deprecation.&quot; Bryant praised Kera Schaley&#x27;s cello playing as the song&#x27;s &quot;secret weapon,&quot; and the bridge as &quot;hands down, Cobain&#x27;s best.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;Dumb&quot; was ranked number seven in &quot;Q&#x27;s&quot; list of the &quot;10 Greatest Nirvana Songs Ever&quot;. In 2011, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it sixth on their list of the Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;10 Best Tracks&quot;. In 2015, it was listed at number 20 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it ninth on their list of &quot;Nirvana&#x27;s 20 greatest songs&quot;. In 2023, Stephen Thomas Erlewine ranked it the 24th best Nirvana song on &quot;the A.V. Club&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Essential Nirvana: Their 30 greatest songs, ranked&quot; list.

&quot;Dumb&quot; was re-released on the band&#x27;s second greatest hits collection, &quot;Icon&quot;, in August 2010.

<text>National Association Grounds was a baseball grounds in Cleveland, Ohio, located at Central Avenue and East 55th Street. It was home to the Cleveland Forest Citys of the National Association in 1871 and 1872, with Cleveland winning five of its sixteen home games. It is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the National Association as a major league.

After many years of use as an amateur baseball field, a new team dubbed Cleveland Forest City moved to the NA Grounds, as members of the short-lived United States Baseball League in 1912. The USBL lasted barely a month before disbanding.

<text>The San Pedro Mountains mummy (known informally as &quot;Pedro&quot;) is a mummy discovered in Wyoming in the 1930s and since lost. Scientific analyses have concluded that it is the mummy of a Native American infant that was born with anencephaly, but its small size and unusual physical features led to theories that it was an early hominid or that it was related to legends of little people. A similar mummy that was studied in the 1990s has been nicknamed &quot;Chiquita&quot;.

==Discovery and description==
The mummy that became known as Pedro was discovered in either 1932 or 1934 in the San Pedro mountains in Carbon County, Wyoming by two gold prospectors, Cecil Mayne and Frank Carr. After blasting open a cave, on a ledge inside it they discovered a mummified body in a seated position, approximately tall, weighing approximately . Its standing height was estimated at . The site may be within the Little Man mining claim, near Pathfinder Reservoir.

==Subsequent history and analysis==
In 1936, Mayne stated in a sworn affidavit that the mummy was then the property of Homer F. Sherrill and was in the Field Museum in Chicago, which has no record of it. Sherrill, a Nebraskan, exhibited it as an early hominid. It was displayed for years in the window of a drug store in Meeteetse, Wyoming. It was purchased in the 1940s by Casper car dealer Ivan Goodman, who mounted it on a wooden base and enclosed it in a domed glass jar and advertised it as a 65-year-old &quot;pygmy&quot;, &quot;preserved as it actually lived&quot;. In 1950, shortly before his death, Goodman either lost it in New York or, according to a 1979 article in the &quot;Casper Star-Tribune&quot;, sold it to Leonard Wadler, who later moved to Florida and died there in the 1980s.

Due to its small size and adult appearance, the mummy was related to Shoshone legends of little people called the Nimerigar, and to non-Native American folklore about &quot;pygmy&quot; Indians. In August 1941, the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; wrote about it in an article headlined &quot;Did a Race of Pygmies Once Live in America?&quot; In 2005, John Adolfi of Granby, New York, offered $10,000 for the mummy, hoping to use it to cast doubt on the established account of human evolution. 

The &quot;Casper Tribune-Herald&quot; reported in 1950 that X-rays of the San Pedro mummy showed adult vertebrae and teeth, and there were reports of solid food in the stomach and of broken bones, but examinations led by Harry L. Shapiro of the American Museum of Natural History in the late 1940s and by Paul Martin of the Field Museum in 1950 concluded that it was an anencephalic infant; the appearance of a miniature adult was the result of the deformed head. George W. Gill of the University of Wyoming saw the X-rays and agreed with this determination, but the films have also been lost.

==Second mummy==
In 1994, Gill was interviewed about the San Pedro mummy for an episode of the TV show &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; along with Eugene Bashor, who was seeking evidence of the Nimerigar. A family in Cheyenne who saw the program then came forward with a similar mummy, high, which had been purchased from a sheepherder in the same region of Wyoming around 1929 and was dubbed &quot;Chiquita&quot;. X-rays and DNA testing performed at Ivinson Memorial Hospital in Laramie and Denver Children&#x27;s Hospital confirmed that it was a naturally mummified anencephalic female infant of Native American ancestry, and it was carbon-dated to approximately 1500 or 1700. The family then withdrew access to the mummy. 

Both mummies are unique among Wyoming Native American burials in being in a seated position, with the arms wrapped around the legs. Chiquita is also unusual for a Native American in being blonde. The only other known mummy of an anencephalic infant is Egyptian.

<text>São Mateus da Calheta is a civil parish within the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 3,757, in an area of 5.98 km2. It is located on the periphery of the urbanized area of the city of Angra do Heroísmo (approximately four from the center), and developed from a small fishing port in a bay along the volcanic coast of the island (&quot;calheta&quot; is Portuguese for &quot;small bay&quot;).

==History==

During the early period of settlement, the São Mateus coast was dotted by bays, some peppered with small beaches. One of these, which became known as &quot;Prainha&quot;, soon became the centre of a small fishing port. Gaspar Frutuoso, writing in his sixth volume of &quot;Saudades da Terra&quot;, referred to the area as &quot;São Mateus da Prainha&quot;, noting: &quot;In addition to the church of São Mateus Além, is a small bay of white sand and small stones in places, where on occasion they throw-out their nets and trammels to catch many fish, principally mullet.&quot; It was Pedro de Merelim who first coined the name &quot;São Mateus da Prainha&quot;, in his chapter on the parish, in &quot;As 18 paróquias de Angra&quot;.

During the 1580s, in anticipation of eventual attacks by forces loyal to King Philip II of Spain, the first forts began to be constructed along the coast: six forts lined the banks of the parishes coast, which included the Grande Fort and the Fort of Negrito. They served the purpose of defending political activities in the archipelago, but also safeguarded the pillaging from pirates and privateers that occurred during this period (which was the justification for the construction of the Fort of the Terreiro, the Fort of the Maré, the Fort of Má Ferramenta and the Fort of São João (São Mateus da Calheta) (also known as the Fort of Biscoitinho). The final defences were completed during the Second World War, with the extension of trenches and installation of gun emplacements.

Father Manuel Luís Maldonado, writing in his work &quot;Fenix Nagrense&quot;, recounted the penitence of the peoples of the parish, as a sequence of the 26 March 1690 storm and 5 April 1690 earthquake. These accounts explain the strong relationship between the parish of São Mateus and São Bartolomeu de Regatos, and the existence of a parochial church in the vicinity of the &quot;old church&quot;, the reference to fishing and the level of poverty. Father António Cordeiro, writing in 1710 wrote of large estates, the coastal fortresses (some with more than 9 pieces of artillery), their garrisons and of the community of São Mateus &quot;with more than 50 neighbours&quot; spread across the territory. Cordeiro also wrote of the fishing: &quot;...this bay in São Mateus, of white sand and small pebbles, where they catch a lot of fish, and salmonettes.&quot;

The primitive parochial church, constructed at &quot;Ponta de S. Mateus&quot; around 1557, would substitute the older chapel. During the construction, the people returned to the smaller &quot;Hermitage of Luz&quot; to complete the weekly rituals. The new church (today known as the &quot;Old Church&quot;) was completed in 1700, and functioned in that role until a 28 August 1893 hurricane when the church was destroyed and abandoned. Between 1694 and 1700 the church was demolished and reconstructed farther to the interior: a cross was left in the former churchyard. Writing in 1834, Luís de Meireles do Canto e Castro, a local resident, complained of the poor protection the seawall offered, resulting in repeated encroachments by the sea.

During the 18th century and early 19th century, the population grew rapidly and the first defensive structure began appearing along the Terreiro and beach near the port. After the 18th century the character of the parish began to change: the population grew and much of the economic activity moved away the orchards of the local estates.

==Geography==
The civil parish occupies a small triangular territory along the southern coast of Terceira, confined in the south by the sea, west by the civil parish of São Bartolomeu de Regatos, northeast by Terra Chã and east by São Pedro.

===Physical geography===

The territory extends through the transition al zone within the Santa Bárbara massif and volcanic complex of the Serra do Morião, in a zone that is relatively low, with a slope of less than five percent grade until elevation, along a north-northwest tract. The highest point in the parish is situated in the extreme north of &quot;Canada da Cruz Dourada&quot; along &quot;Canada de Trás&quot;. In the central part of the territory is the basaltic spatter cone Pico dos Merens: its peak is named after one of the local families who, for centuries, were local property-owners in the region: the Merens of Távora. Also known as &quot;Pico de Merens&quot; or &quot;Pico do Alvernaz&quot;, the cone is elevation, and responsible for the Biscoitinho Platform that extends to the sea.

The Biscoitinho Platform, over which the main built-up part of the civil parish is situated, terminates at small rectangular promontory consisting of several coves and bays. One of these bays, which is relatively deep, provided shelter for early settlers from western and southwestern weather systems, giving rise to the port of São Mateus. Another cove to the west, which is wider and open to the sea, resulted in the settlement of Terreiro. To the east and west of the Biscoitinho Platform the coast is low, with altitudes less than , consisting of basalt primarily, with some pyroclasts. The exception is the zone of Ponta de São Mateus, near the old church, where the coast is covered in a thick layer of ignimbrites.

To the east of the port there two areas, Baía das Mercês and Poço da Luz, where the coast is almost level with the sea, and where stone beaches are common. Historically, there have been records of tsunamis or southerly swells that have inundated the areas (the last occurring on 18 February 2003), while the area the territory is delimited by wall to protect the roadway.

West, after the Calheta do Terreiro, the coast extends further into the sea, yet still only less than above sea level, forming the tip of São Mateus. Being on the coast, the area is influenced by Atlantic storms, resulting in the construction of various barriers. In the small bay of Negrito, historically defended by the Fort of Negrito and location of a former whaling port, are the principal swimming areas on the island. After Negrito is the western limit of the civil parish in the area known as Chanoca, an area of basalt cliffs with difficult access.

===Human geography===

The structure of São Mateus is different from other parishes in the southwest corner of Terceira, with a specific economy associated with fishing and services. While the upper regions of the parish has marked by rural character, the central area is primarily urban, centred around the parochial church and fishing community. The parish contains the localities Bairro Novo, Canada da Cruz Dourada, Canada da Igreja, Canada do Capitão Mor, Canada do Pombal, Canada dos Calços, Canada dos Folhadais, Canada Francesa, São Mateus and Terra Pão. These 50 named agglomerations are connected by a patchwork of linear roadways extending from the Estrada Regional E.R.1-1ª, organized into:
* São Mateus — the main village, centred on Biscoitinho and port, includes a dense urban concentration with numerous roads and cul de sacs, characterized by the homes of the poor and fishermen. Towards the west the agglomeration abruptly terminates at Terreiro, limited by the zone of Arrife, which is almost underpopulated, except for the homes of the early gentry and noble classes of Angra. In the east, towards Angra do Heroísmo, the urban area extends along the coast, broken by the Fortress of São Mateus da Calheta, towards the social housing of the &quot;Bairro dos Pescadores&quot; constructed during the Estado Novo regime. The construction of social housing in Terreiro, the periphery of the Bairro dos Pescadores and beginning of the &quot;Canada da Arruda&quot; resulted in a high urban density, giving the parish the character of an extension of Angra. In the extreme east of the parish, in the zone between Poço da Luz and the border with São Pedro, are many of the 18th and 19th century estates that pertained to the aristocratic families of Terceira;
* Cantinho — this is the secondary urban agglomeration of the parish, characterized by linear growth along the route between Angra and São Bartolomeu dos Regatos (known as the &quot;Caminho do Meio&quot;). Its center is situated at the Hermitage of São Francisco das Almas, a name that once served as the toponymic reference, but actually includes Entre-Ladeiras, Terra do Pão and Canada da Francesa. It is a zone that is markedly rural, inhabited by farmers and similar to the parishes of the western part of the island, and socially separate from the rest of the parish, with its own primary school, &quot;império&quot; and parochial churches.;
* The &quot;Canadas&quot; — connecting the coastal roadway (or &quot;Caminho de Baixo&quot;) with the Angra-São Bartolomeu dos Regatos access (&quot;Caminho do Meio&quot;) are several secondary lines of residences known as &quot;Canadas&quot; da Luz, da Arruda, do Capitão-Mor and da Cruz Dourada, that were extended linearly along these roads. These were transitional spaces, lightly populated, between the coastal fishing communities and their rural interior. These &quot;Canadas&quot; were transformed into new extensions of Angra, as bedroom communities.

* Fortress of São Mateus da Calheta ()
* Fort of the Church of São Mateus da Calheta ()

===Religious===
* Church of São Mateus da Calheta ()
* Church of São Mateus da Calheta (Old) (), dating to the mid 16th-century, the &quot;Igreja Velha&quot; (&quot;Old Church&quot;) was built to replace the old hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Luz, but its location (along the coast) made it susceptible to winter storms and hurricanes; on 28 August 1893, it was hit by a hurricane resulting in the destruction of most of its roof, and its eventual abandon. It was replaced by the main parochial church.
* Império do Espírito Santo do Cantinho 
* Império do Espírito Santo do Terreiro 
*Império do Espíritu Santo de São Mateus da Calheta, a Holy Spirit Chapel dating from 1873

<text>Parchim (; Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch: &quot;Parchen&quot;) is a town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It is the capital of the Ludwigslust-Parchim district. It was the birthplace of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, to whom a monument was erected in 1876.

Founded about 1210, it was the seat of the short-lived Lordship of Parchim-Richenberg, a partition of the Duchy of Mecklenburg, from 1226 until 1248 when the lord relocated to Richenberg. Parchim was absorbed into the Lordship of Werle in 1255. In 1277 Werle was partitioned and Parchim became the seat of Werle-Parchim until it was reunited with Werle-Güstrow in 1307. One branch of the family of the duke of Mecklenburg resided in Parchim during part of the 14th century. It became a prosperous industrial town during the 16th century, but this prosperity was destroyed by the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

<text>Clara Mae Ward (April 21, 1924 – January 16, 1973) was an American gospel singer who achieved great artistic and commercial success during the 1940s and 1950s, as leader of the Famous Ward Singers. A gifted singer and arranger, Ward adopted the lead-switching style, previously used primarily by male gospel quartets, creating opportunities for spontaneous improvisation and vamping by each member of the group, while giving virtuoso singers such as Marion Williams the opportunity to perform the lead vocal in songs such as &quot;Surely, God Is Able&quot; (among the first million-selling gospel hits), &quot;How I Got Over&quot; and &quot;Packin&#x27; Up&quot;.

== Career ==

Ward&#x27;s mother, Gertrude Mae Ward (née Murphy; 1901–1981), founded the Ward Singers in 1931 as a family group, then called, variously, the Consecrated Gospel Singers or the Ward Trio, consisting of herself, her youngest daughter Clara, and her elder daughter, Willarene Mae (&quot;Willa,&quot; 1920-2012). Ward recorded her first solo song in 1940, and continued accompanying the Ward Gospel Trio, thereafter.

=== 1931–1952: The Ward Singers ===
The Ward Singers began touring nationally in 1943, following a memorable appearance at the National Baptist Convention held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, earlier that year. Henrietta Waddy joined the group in 1947. The group&#x27;s performance style, such as the mimed packing of suitcases as part of the song &quot;Packin&#x27; Up&quot;, condemned by some gospel music purists as &quot;clowning&quot;, was wildly popular with their audiences.

The addition of Marion Williams brought to the group a powerful singer with a preternaturally broad range, able to reach the highest registers of the soprano range without losing either purity or volume, with the added ability to descend &quot;growling low notes&quot; in the style of a country preacher. Williams&#x27; singing style helped make the group nationally popular when they began recording in 1948.

In 1949, the Ward Singers toured from Philadelphia to California in their new Cadillac, appeared on national television programs, and recorded for the Miltone Record Company of Los Angeles. The Miltone recordings were purchased in a multi-artist package by Gotham Record Company, which had moved to Philadelphia. Gotham&#x27;s Irv Ballen recorded some new Ward material, including &quot;Surely God Is Able&quot;, and some of the Ward Singers&#x27; Gotham recordings were transferred to Savoy Record Company in Newark, New Jersey to settle a contract dispute. When Savoy began contracting with the Ward Singers for new recordings in the 1950s, they were primarily recorded and engineered in Bergen County, New Jersey by Rudy Van Gelder.

In 1950, Clara Ward and the Ward Singers of Philadelphia made their first Carnegie Hall appearance on a gospel program titled &quot;Negro Music Festival&quot;, produced by gospel music pioneer, Joe Bostic, sharing the stage with Mahalia Jackson, appearing at the famed venue for Bostic&#x27;s program in 1952, as well.

Gertrude Ward created a booking agency for gospel acts, sponsored tours under the name &quot;the Ward Gospel Cavalcade&quot;, established a publishing house for gospel music, and wrote an instructional manual for churches, detailing how to promote gospel programs. Gertrude created and managed a second group, &quot;the Clara Ward Specials&quot;, to accompany the Ward Singers. Although as musical director of the Ward franchise, Clara was willing to share the spotlight with her talented co-singers, she and her mother were allegedly reticent about sharing the group&#x27;s financial rewards with other members, as well.

According to Willa Ward&#x27;s biography of Clara Ward, with the exception of Gertrude and Clara, Willa and other members of the group were grossly underpaid. In addition, their meager earnings were further reduced as Gertrude and Clara provided the group&#x27;s housing and charged them for it. Accordingly, stars such as Marion Williams and Frances Steadman not only had to accept second billing and lesser pay for their work, but pay their employers rent out of their earnings.

Williams left the group in 1958, when her demand for a raise and reimbursement for hotel expenses was rejected. She was followed shortly thereafter by the rest of the group — Henrietta Waddy, Esther Ford, Frances Steadman and Kitty Parham — who formed a new group, &quot;the Stars of Faith&quot;. Their departure marked the end of the glory days for the Ward Singers, who later alienated much of their churchgoing audience by performing in Las Vegas, nightclubs, and other secular venues in the 1960s. By this time, gospel singer Albertina Walker formed her group, the Caravans, in 1952, following the advice of her mentor Mahalia Jackson, and their group began to grow in popularity.

In 1963, Clara Ward was the second gospel singer to sing gospel songs on Broadway in Langston Hughes&#x27; play &quot;Tambourines to Glory&quot; (the first being her former group members, which were known as the Stars of Faith, which starred Langston Hughes in the first Gospel stage play and first play that featured an all black cast to be produced on Broadway, &quot;The Black Nativity&quot;.). She was also the play&#x27;s musical director.

=== 1953–1972: The Clara Ward Singers ===
Ward was the first gospel singer to sing with a 100-piece symphony orchestra in the 1960s. The Clara Ward Singers recorded an album together on the Verve label, V-5019, &quot;The Heart, the Faith, the Soul of Clara Ward,&quot; and the Ward Singers performed their music live in Philadelphia with the city&#x27;s Symphony and the Golden Voices Ensemble. Ward sang backup for pop artists with her sister Willa&#x27;s background group, most notably on Dee Dee Sharp&#x27;s hit, &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot;, which reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1962.

In 1969, Ward recorded an album for Capitol Records, &quot;Soul and Inspiration&quot;, consisting of pop songs from Broadway plays, Hollywood movies and the Jimmy Radcliffe song of hope &quot;If You Wanna Change the World&quot;. The album was later reissued on the Capitol&#x27;s budget Pickwick label minus one track. In the same year, she recorded an album in Copenhagen, Denmark on the Philips label, &quot;Walk A Mile In My Shoes&quot;, which included the pop title song, other pop songs (such as &quot;California Dreaming&quot;) and a few gospel songs.

Ward also recorded an album for MGM/Verve, &quot;Hang Your Tears Out To Dry,&quot; which included country and Western, blues/folk, pop and an arrangement of the Beatles&#x27; hit song, &quot;Help&quot;. Her 1972 album &quot;Uplifting&quot; on United Artists, produced by Nikolas Venet and Sam Alexander, included an interpretation of Bill Wither&#x27;s pop hit &quot;Lean On Me&quot; and a rearrangement of the Soul Stirrers&#x27; 1950s recording of &quot;Thank You, Jesus&quot;. Also in 1972 Ward, because she was under exclusive contract to United Artists at this time, provided vocals for a Canned Heat&#x27;s album &quot;The New Age,&quot; on the ballad &quot;Lookin&#x27; For My Rainbow&quot;; it was released on that album and as a single 45 rpm record.

In 1968, the Clara Ward Singers toured Vietnam at the request of the U.S. State Department and the U.S.O. It was a popular war-time tour supported by recorded radio broadcasts of the Ward Singers on U.S. Armed Forces Radio. The Ward Singers narrowly missed death when their hotel in Vietnam was bombed and several guests died. Ward was invited back to Vietnam by U.S.O. in 1969 for several more months. These war-time tours were filmed and all the Ward Singers were given special certificates of recognition by the U.S. Army.

Ward co-starred in the Hollywood movie &quot;A Time to Sing&quot;, starring Hank Williams, Jr., and Shelley Fabares, Ed Begley. She was cast as a waitress in a Nashville cafeteria who inspires a young singer, played by Williams, to pursue his dream of becoming a country recording artist. There are also several scenes of the Clara Ward Singers performing gospel songs in the film. This movie was released by MGM in 1968 and Clara&#x27;s picture appears on lobby cards and other movie advertisements.

Other movie appearances include &quot;Its Your Thing&quot;, starring the Isley Brothers, and &quot;Spree&quot;, also known as &quot;Night Time In Las Vegas&quot;. The Clara Ward Singers toured in Australia, Japan, Europe, Indonesia, and Thailand during the late-1960s through the early-1970s. They had a one-day TV special in London, England. They were in constant demand on American television programs and appeared on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; over a dozen times. They appeared on Oral Roberts&#x27; &quot;Country Roads&quot; TV special, later released as a soundtrack album. Clara continued to perform at her mother&#x27;s church, the Miracle Temple of Faith for All People in Los Angeles, California, as well as at Victory Baptist Church. Her mother, Gertrude Ward, also had a popular religious radio program in the Los Angeles market.

== Health, death, and legacy ==
Ward collapsed while performing at the Castaways Lounge in Miami Beach, Florida in May 1966. Ward suffered a series of strokes prior to her death. The first occurred in August 1967 which was listed as &quot;massive&quot;. Two more strokes followed: one listed as &quot;minor&quot; during a recording session at her home in December 1972; another on January 9, 1973, which left Ward in a coma.

Ward died on January 16, 1973 at age 48 as a result of the strokes. Aretha Franklin and Rev. C. L. Franklin sang at her funeral in Philadelphia; Marion Williams sang at her second memorial service held days later in Los Angeles.

Clara Ward is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

In 1977, Ward was honored posthumously at the Songwriters Hall of Fame in New York City and her surviving sister, Willa, accepted the award in her honor.

In July 1998, in recognition of her status, the United States Postal Service issued a 32-cent stamp with her image. The stamp can still be purchased with a CD and other gospel singers&#x27; stamps online.

<doc id="1296423" wikidata="Q332952" url="?curid=1296423" title="Überlingen">
<text>Überlingen (; ) is a German city on the northern shore of Lake Constance (Bodensee) in Baden-Württemberg near the border with Switzerland. After the city of Friedrichshafen, it is the second-largest city in the Bodenseekreis (district), and a central point for the outlying communities. Since 1 January 1993, Überlingen has been categorized as a large district city (&quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot;).

==History==

The history of Überlingen dates back to Roman times, but a variety of settlements antedated Roman occupation. Stone Age settlements, discovered along the shoreline of Lake Constance, document that the lake supported several dozen thriving communities of 50–100 individuals. These settlements fall under the category of the Hallstatt culture, and their habits, dress, and diet have been illuminated through the excavation of archaeological sites, such as a major site in Hallstatt, Austria, excavated in the mid- to late 19th century.

Similar sites, although smaller, have been found in vicinity of Überlingen - a site near Hödingen, another near Dettingen, by Constance, and a major site near the village of Unteruhldingen, where there is now an open air archaeological museum.

The dead were either burned, or buried in mounds or flat graves; women wore jewelry made of bronze or gold, especially earrings. Tools uncovered in archeological excavation suggest that these communities engaged in a combination of hunting, fishing, and agriculture.

===Roman and Merovingian period===
The Alpine lands and the eastern Swiss Plateau were overrun by the troops of the emperor Augustus (31 BCE to 14 CE), who established the Roman writ from the Alps to the Danube, through the efforts of Augustus&#x27; stepsons Drusus and Tiberius. According to some interpretations of the Roman records, one of the Bodensee islands, probably Mainau, was the operations base for the military operations in 15 BCE.

The necessities of troop transport and ship building and maintenance required the Romans to possess the entire Swiss shore of the lake, and from these points along the lake, the Romans could mount a double-pointed excursion to the eastern Tyrol and present-day Bavaria, or to the West, in the Rhine valley. The Bodensee region, as a Roman province administered from &quot;Augusta Vindelicorum&quot;, present-day Augsburg, was governed by a finance official (&quot;procurator&quot;) under Tiberius&#x27;s command. The road from Stockach to Überlingen, and then along the lake&#x27;s shore to Uhldingen and on to Friedrichshafen, and the east–west train tracks, generally follow the path of the old Roman road.

Evidence of conflicts between the Romans, their power waning, and the Alemannic and other Germanic groups, their power rising, appears throughout the region. New settlements appeared on top of burned settlements and old villages and farmsteads were reclaimed first by forests and meadows and then again reclaimed by men. By the latter half of the fourth century, several families emerged as the warrior leaders, capable of fending off minor Roman comebacks, and of protecting themselves, their kin, and their dependents from not only the Romans, but also other groups.

As the Romans withdrew more and more of their forces, to concentrate on the western boundaries or to focus on the conquest defense of Iberia, Franks, particularly Clodwig, or Clovis (482–511), and Goths, particularly Theodorich (471–527), contested for control of the region. Throughout this period, Alemannic dukes maintained their primary seat in Überlingen. The Alemannic Überlingen was first mentioned in 770 as &quot;Iburinga&quot;. Before that, it was probably known as &quot;Gunzoburg&quot; (641), the seat of the Alemannic or Swabian duke Gunzo. The probable site of Gunzo&#x27;s villa has been identified in the northwestern quadrant of the city, just outside the present-day inner moat.

===Medieval period===
The Allemannic dukes were well connected to other families throughout Europe; the first wife of Charlemagne, Hildegard, came from the family of Linzgau counts, whose seat in Buchhorn (present-day Friedrichshafen) bordered the lake. Louis the Pious, 814–840, and Louis the German, 843–876, both married women from the Alemannic Welfen families. In the 10th century, the Linzgau fell to an invasion of the Hungarians, and ongoing battles with the Hungarians nearly brought the families of the region to ruin.

The Investiture Controversy of the 11th century brought further conflict. Villages and properties in the possession of one side of the conflict would be besieged and destroyed by members of the other party, in battle after gruesome battle, but by the end of the 11th century and the first half of the 12th, the Hohenstaufen emperors stabilized the Holy Roman Empire. The family came from the region, and Swabia, the Linzgau, and the Bodensee region became the middle point of the Empire.

This is also the beginning of Überlingen&#x27;s period of blossoming. Many of the documents from the period have been lost, possibly in the city fire in 1279, but a great deal of information can be extrapolated. Hand-in-hand with the expansion of the Holy Roman Empire, localities throughout the empire experienced infrastructure improvements - improved roads and exchange regulations encouraged trade, particularly in the all-important, centrally located Swabia. The exact date in which the city received its market rights is ambiguous, but it was probably between 1180 and 1191; maps showing the trading road from Stockach to Buchhorn show the city of Überlingen in comparable size and type; by 1226 Überlingen had a Jewish cemetery, and these clues lead to the conclusion that the city had a market for a much longer period than this, thus the supposition that Emperor Barbarossa had established the market at the end of his own regime. He had been in the region several times: 1153, 1155, 1162, 1181, 1183, to hold court sessions, and in 1187, he stayed in Wallhausen, across the lake, to sign the documents establishing the Cloister of Salem.

At the end of the 14th century, the city was granted status as a free imperial city. In 1547, the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, broadened the city&#x27;s market rights to prohibit any trade in grain or salt within two German miles (about 15 km or 10 English miles) of the city.

===Early modern period===
The city flourished in the 13th to 16th centuries, mainly due to widespread grapevine cultivation on the south-facing slopes of the Lake Constance and its salubrious climate, which gave rise to a profitable &quot;spital&quot; (hospital) industry. The Holy Ghost Spital in Überlingen held large landholdings in Upper and Lower Linzgau, and in the Hegau. The city&#x27;s affluence encouraged the construction of an impressive religious building - the St Nikolaus Munster in the late 15th century; a City Hall in the late 15th century; and impressive residences for the family of the spital doctors. The relative affluence of the city has been documented in its art and architecture, and the size and solidity of its physical plant, especially its fortifications.

As a fortified bridgehead, the city proved vital to the reduction of the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525. When Georg Truchsess von Waldburg&#x27;s soldiers rose against him during the war, and besieged Radolfzell, the Burgermeister of Überlingen led a small force to free the nearby town; they returned with 150 prisoners, all of whom were executed in a single day by the city&#x27;s executioner. As a result of this assistance, Überlingen was granted the right to quarter a shield with a drawn sword, the Habsburg hawk, and the imperial eagle. As a result of its participation and assistance, the city retained its guild rights after the Schmalkaldic War of the 1540s and 1550s. In the Thirty Years War, the city was invested and besieged by Swedish soldiers and their Saxon allies in 1632 and 1634; despite lengthy and grueling siege, the city defenses held. Even when the walls were breached in May 1634, the population was able to resist in street to street, and house-to-house fighting, until the invaders withdrew. This seemingly miraculous occasion was attributed to the intervention of the Virgin Mary, and every year the citizens of Überlingen hold a so-called Sweden Procession. Another assault on the city in 1643 resulted in a French occupation until Franz von Mercy&#x27;s Imperial-Bavarian army recaptured it in 1644. As a result of the Truce of Ulm ending hostilities between Bavaria and the allies Sweden and France, Swedish troops occupied the city in 1647–1649.

===Annexation by the Duchy of Baden: 1803–1918===

With the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in 1803, Überlingen lost its status as a free imperial city, and its legal, economic, and political autonomy. As part of the German Mediatisation process, through which several of the German dynasties that lost lands and subjects on the west bank of the Rhine were compensated with other territories and populations, Überlingen became a part of the duchy of Baden, later the Grand Duchy of Baden. Through 13 organization edicts, the Duchy of Baden administration reorganized formerly free territories into a new ducal organization. For Überlingen, this meant the restructuring of the entire apparatus of administration and governance. Organization edicts deconstructed Überlingen&#x27;s consular system of mayors, in which two men were elected to the office for one year, the first serving until immediately after Christmas, and the second from then until the new election in the spring. The once free imperial city became the administrative seat for the district (&quot;Bezirksamt&quot;).

Despite the relative importance of its position of administrative authority, the city entered a nearly century-long economic decline, exacerbated in the first decade of ducal authority by the Year without Summer, a consequence of the Tambora volcanic eruption in 1815, which had a VEI–7 index.

In the revolutionary period, 1848–1849, Überlingen experienced its share of turmoil. Überlingen&#x27;s own militia apparently enjoyed an early occupation of the wine cellars at the former Salem Abbey, which after 1803 became a ducal palace and winery, but revolutionary activity extended more deeply into the social fabric. In early July 1848, Prussian and Bavarian troops invaded the Bodensee region, and imposed a form of military rule; several important personages, including Überlingen&#x27;s physician and one of its schoolteachers, drew lengthy prison sentences for their revolutionary activity, nine months and a year, respectively. One of the former abbeys served as a prison for revolutionary convicts. Two companies of Prussian troops, about 400 men plus their officers, occupied the city until late 1850, when they were replaced by ducal troops. Although no sons of Überlingen fought in the civil war with Austria (Austro-Prussian War), Baden preferred to remain outside the conflict, and 72 of Überlingen&#x27;s young men were called to fight the war with France in 1870; three of them fell in action and are commemorated in the parish church, St. Nikolaus. From 1846 to 1910, around 300 Überlingen sons and daughters emigrated to Switzerland, North or South America, or Australia.

===Überlingen as a spa===

The healing properties of the city&#x27;s mineral waters, which sprang from a source under one of the towers on the western side of the city wall, had been understood since the early 16th century, and produced a regular source of income for the city and the &quot;spital&quot;; during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the spring had been covered over; it remained covered in the postwar period and then was largely forgotten. It was &quot;rediscovered&quot; during Überlingen&#x27;s difficult times. A spa hotel was constructed and the notables started to arrive: Heinrich Zschokke (1771–1848), Ludwig Uhland, the poet (1787–1862), Gustav Schwab (1792–1850), and Germanist Franz Pfeiffer (1815–1868) were regular visitors. A pathway along the western wall, to the highest point within the city gates, is still called the Uhland walkway, and a marker notes that this was one of the poet&#x27;s favorite walks.

The economic problems were in large part due to the difficulties of transportation. Although the first coal-powered steam ship, the &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; (named for the impregnable castle on the dormant volcano Hohentwiel by Singen), owned by Joseph Cotta, had traversed the lake in 1825, the city did not emerge from its economic difficulties as a spa city until 1895, with the construction of a railway link to Überlingen. In 1901, the link was connected through Friedrichshafen, making travel to and from the city easier and quicker, and improving the city&#x27;s prospects as a spa city. The link to Friedrichshafen completed the laying of tracks around the lake. Once the rail line was completed, marketing the city as a spa resort became feasible.
===The Weimar Republic and the period of National Socialism===
The peaceful life in Überlingen was interrupted by the war in 1914, when 145 of its sons died, and 20 were missing in action. In 1918, with the German Revolution and the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm, Überlingen became part of the Republic of Baden. For some, &quot;the Revolution in the year 1918 came as a peaceful relief,&quot; but from 1918 to 1923, inflation overran the city, and many of the pensioners living there fell on hard times.

During the period of National Socialism (Third Reich), a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp was established on the outskirts of Überlingen (KZ Aufkirch).

From October 1944 to April 1945, its 800 detainees worked in Überlingen, constructing an extensive underground facility, the Goldbach Stollen, for the manufacture of military armaments. The underground facility, established in natural caves and tunnels, protected the plant from Allied bombing runs. Of the 800 workers, 168 detainees died in either the cave conversion or a misdirected Allied bombing raid. The names of the dead &quot;KZ&quot; prisoners are listed in the book by Oswald Burger (&quot;Der Stollen&quot;) as a memorial.

On 22 February 1945, Überlingen experienced its only bombing raid, possibly attracted by the presence of the Dachau subcamp. In this raid, part of Operation Clarion, seven medium-range B–26 Martin Marauders of the US 320th Air Expeditionary Wing dropped 56 500-pound bombs, seveen of them with delay fuses, on the city&#x27;s rail yards. The bombers had taken off from the base in eastern France by Épinal and dropped their bombs at about 13:45. The bombs destroyed six residential buildings, and severely damaged 17 others; 38 buildings were slightly damaged. Eleven forced laborers, four members of the military construction crews, and five residents of the Upper Station Road 97 are buried in the cemetery in the nearby pilgrim church Birnau. The memorial lies about east of the church.

Troops of the French army arrived on 25 April 1945, and collected all the arms, munitions and weaponry in the city, to be stored in one of the former guild houses built in the 15th century. On the night of 2 May of the year, a fire destroyed the building and the western side of the market square. The fire is thought to have been started by a careless French sentry.

From 1937, German-Jewish composer Walter Braunfels avoided Nazi persecution by living in near-anonymity in Überlingen. There, he composed music (including three large-scale stage works) and made a living teaching music to the local children during the course of the Second World War.

===After World War II to present===
In 1972, Überlingen became the first city in the German Federal Republic to institute a tax for residents who obtain a second home in the city (), which became known as the so-called Überlingen model. With the administrative reform of 1973, Überlingen lost its status as the seat of the County of Überlingen (). A major part of it was merged with the County of Tettnang () to Lake Constance County (Bodenseekreis). In January 1993, Überlingen became a great district city (&quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot;) granted by the state administration of Baden-Württemberg.

In March 1980, Winifred Wagner, the widow of Siegfried Wagner, died at Überlingen.

===Überlingen as a resort today===
By the 1950s, Überlingen had established itself as a premier tourist destination on Lake Bodensee, particularly for those interested in the health cure. Überlingen was Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s first &quot;Kneippheilbad&quot;, a homeopathic cure using water therapy, diet, aroma therapy, and exercise, is based on the principles of health developed by Sebastian Kneipp. The city&#x27;s shore promenade ends at the new health resort (opened 2003), the Bodensee Therme (spa). In 2005, the city and its collaborators, Deisendorf and Lippertsreute, won the gold medal in the competition, Our City Blooms (&quot;Unsere Stadt blüht auf&quot;).
The city also provides numerous walking paths and is located on the long &quot;Jubiläumsweg&quot;, an historic landmark and nature trail through the Bodensee region beginning at Kressbronn and ending at the Überlingen Therme.

Überlingen has also joined the Cittaslow movement to protect itself from overdevelopment. In 2012, the city banned genetically modified organisms and pesticides.

===2002 midair collision===

The city received international attention in July 2002 with the midair collision of Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937, a Tupolev Tu-154, and DHL Flight 611 (a Boeing 757-23APF cargo jet manned by two pilots) on 1 July 2002. In this incident, the passenger plane carrying 69, mostly children and a few adult chaperones, who were travelling to Spain, collided with a cargo plane in midair, at about . The debris fell throughout the northern Überlingen suburbs. Seventy-one people died in the accident, including all the children, their chaperones, and the pilot and co-pilot of the Boeing cargo plane. One of the largest portions of the debris landed in a glade by Brachenreuthe, and the victims of the crash are commemorated there with a string of oversized &quot;pearls&quot;.

Less than two years later, on 24 February 2004, Peter Nielsen, the air traffic controller on duty at the time of the accident, was stabbed to death by an architect, Vitaly Kaloyev, who had lost his wife and two children in the accident. Nielsen was 36 years old.

On 19 May 2004, the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation published its determination that the accident had been caused by shortcomings in the Swiss air traffic control system supervising the flights at the time of the accident and by ambiguities in the use of TCAS, the on-board aircraft collision avoidance system.

==Geography==
Überlingen is located on the so-called Überlinger Lake portion of Lake Constance, an important water source for southwestern Germany. The countryside is a hilly moraine, formed in the last ice age.

The city is from Zürich, from Constance, and from Munich.

The following cities and communities border the city of Überlingen. Clockwise from the west, they are: Bodman-Ludwigshafen and Stockach, which belong to the County of Constance, and Sipplingen, Bodman, Ludwigshafen, Owingen, Frickingen, Salem and Uhldingen-Mühlhofen. The city exercises legal jurisdiction over the neighboring communities of Owingen and Sipplingen.

=== Administrative subdivisions of Überlingen ===

Besides central Überlingen (the &quot;Kernstadt&quot;), the town of Überlingen consists of several villages and neighborhoods. Throughout Baden-Württemberg, in the second half of the 20th century, many old farmsteads were developed into neighborhoods. Some of them retained the names of old villages or large farmsteads. Administrative reorganizations consolidated many of these tiny communities into municipalities and administrative districts.

After restructure in the administrative reform of the 1970s, the formerly independent municipalities of Bambergen, Bonndorf, Deisendorf, Hödingen, Lippertsreute, Nesselwangen, und Nußdorf are now included in Überlingen. The townships are unified - today, in the sense that they have their own elections for municipal governments, with a municipal administrator.

Some are listed below:
*in the &quot;Kernstadt&quot;: Altbirnau, Andelshofen, Aufkirch, Brachenreuthe, Brünnensbach, Goldbach, Höllwangen, Hohenlinden, Kogenbach, Rengoldshausen, Restlehof, Reutehöfe, Weiherhöfe
*to &quot;Bambergen&quot;: Forsthaus Hohrain, Heffhäusle, Neuhof, Ottomühle, Reuthemühle, Schönbuch
*to &quot;Bonndorf&quot;: Buohof, Eggenweiler, Fuchsloch, Haldenhof, Helchenhof, Kaienhof, Negelhof, Talmühle, Walpertsweiler
*to &quot;Deisendorf&quot;: Hasenweide, Katharinenhof, Klammerhölzle, Königshof, Nonnenhölzle, Scheinbuch, Wilmershof

===Architecture===

The Münster St. Nikolaus is the largest late Gothic building in the region and a city landmark, as well as an emblem of Überlingen. The church has a large wooden altar carved by Jörg Zürn in the late Renaissance. On a pier in the inner altar is a figure of Jakob with his staff and scallop shell. On a wider pier is a cannonball from the 1634 siege by Swedish troops and their allies; it carries the inscription (loosely translated): &quot;Swedish Field Marshal HOX would subdue Überlingen, [his Swedish troops] attempted and lost three stormings [of the city], and afterward he must yield. Maria (Holy Maria) this is your Victory sign&quot;. The cannonball was fired into the city and lodged in the main beam of the Hosanna bell tower.

The Sylvester Chapel in the city quarter of Goldbach is the oldest church building in the Lake Constance region, and contains frescoes of the Reichenauer School from the ninth century.

The City Hall was erected during the Renaissance period. The City Council hall is decorated with a cycle of limewood figures carved by master Jakob Ruß. The figures illustrate the hierarchy of the imperial estates, from princes to peasants, arranged into groups of four – the so-called &quot;Imperial quaternions&quot;. The decorative programme offers an impression of the power structure in the time of its installation (1490–1494).

The Granary served as the center of Überlingen&#x27;s once great grain trade and, since its complete renovation in 1998, is one of the most visually appealing cultural monuments of the city. Between the landing place and the market place, directly on the shore of the lake, the classic structure of the merchant and grain house can be seen from Mainau. Since its renovation in 1998, it is a notable cultural monument of the city. Documentary evidence through the proclamation of the so-called Grain Ordinance dates the original building to 1421.

Construction researchers date the load-bearing oak piers to the year 1382. Foundation remnants suggest it was the site of an older building of similar size. The present-day Granary was constructed in 1788 by Franz Anton Bagnato, in the style of the transitional period from Baroque to Classic. Since 1936/37, it has been protected under the Baden State Building ordinance.

The Franciscan church was built in 1348 in the Romanesque style, and in the early 18th century, converted to a Baroque style. It was renovated in the 1990s. The Chapel of St Michael (Aufkirch), outside of the city, was built in 1000, and was the city&#x27;s first parish church. It and the village were severely damaged in the 1634 siege.

===Geologic anomalies===
Überlingen&#x27;s location on the eastern Swiss plateau places it at the end of glacial moraine of the second ice age. The glaciers of the last ice age cut through the region as well, creating a mixture of moraine and glacial cuts, the deepest of which runs through the old forests at Hödingen to the lake. The combination of glacial carving, moraine, and erosion have created several unique geologic formations.

===Spetzgart===
The area immediately to the west of Überlingen is known as the &quot;Spetzgart&quot;, due to its jointed tower formations. The name reflects the region&#x27;s complex &quot;Alemannic&quot; language traditions: &quot;Spetz&quot; (or spitz, meaning point) and &quot;Gart&quot; (or Garten, meaning garden). The &quot;Spetz&quot; are an example of the geologic processes that shaped the eastern regions of the Swiss plateau. One can also see the geologic &quot;molasse&quot; created in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. This area is a protected Natural area (see below).

===Protected areas===
In Überlingen and its surrounding environs, there are, as of April 2009, three Rural Parks and four Nature Areas, protected by law.

* Protected Natural Areas
The &quot;Aach Ravine&quot;, 72 hectares (ha), the &quot;Hödinger Ravine&quot; (28 ha) between Hödingen and Sipplingen, the &quot;Katharine Rocks&quot; (4 ha) and &quot;Spetzgart Ravine&quot; (12 ha) between Goldbach und Spetzgart.

===Climate===
Despite its distance from an ocean, Überlingen has, depending on the definition used, an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), with four distinct seasons. The climate is generally mesothermal with seasonal variations. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Überlingen is a &quot;Cfb&quot; climate: the &quot;C&quot; designates climates with average monthly temperatures above in their warmest months (April to September in northern hemisphere) and above in their coldest months. The &quot;f&quot; indicates a significant year-round precipitation pattern with little or no difference between the amount of precipitation in the warmer months and the colder months. Decisively for the climate, winds can flow alternately from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation, and easterly, which usually includes high pressure systems and cooler weather than average. The Föhn, a warm wind, plays an important role in the northern alpine valleys and has also some impact on the cities around Lake Constance. The Bise, or east or north-east wind, is especially typical in winter. The most severe weather often occurs during the change of season, when both kinds of winds bring weather fronts that collide.
==Demographics==


==Economy==
Überlingen is home of several high tech industries in manufacturing, defense, and electrical engineering. Among them are:
*Diehl Defence GmbH &amp; Co. KG
*MTU Friedrichshafen Logistics
*RAFI Eltec GmbH

==Culture==

===Dialects===

Überlingen is situated in the area where a variety of Low Alemannic German (Niederalemannisch), Lake Constance Alemannic German (Bodenseealemannisch) is spoken. Lake Constance Alemannic German can be distinguished from High Alemannic German spoken to the south in Switzerland and Swabian, which is spoken to the east in Friedrichshafen and to the north from Pfullendorf on.

===Fastnacht===
Überlingen is a stronghold of the Swabian-Alemannic carnival. The carnival club, &quot;Narrenzunft Überlingen&quot;, or the Knaves Guild of Überlingen, is a member of the &quot;Viererbund&quot; carnival union. The carnival clubs of Rottweil, Oberndorf and Elzach are the other three members of this union. The carnival character of Überlingen dates to the 14th century, when it is first mentioned in city council documents; the figure is called &quot;Der Überlinger Hänsele,&quot; which would translate roughly, and redundantly, as The Little Jackie of Überlingen.

On St. Martin&#x27;s Day, in November, the Carnival clubs officially begin their practice; the club members parade through the streets behind a band playing the Hänsele song. Überlingers fall into line behind the Hänsele, and the procession ends with an impromptu rally in the market square. The carnival clubs heighten their activities closer to Fastnacht, the Swabian term for the celebration of carnival (see also Fasching or Fastnacht). Celebrations peak at Shrove Tuesday.

The carnival character, Hänsele, appears in many celebrations throughout the year. There is only one chosen &quot;Hänsele,&quot; and he is involved in most civic celebrations; his identity usually remains anonymous. Other club members also dress up as the figure. Hänsele&#x27;s costume is noted for its colorful felted squares, its fox&#x27;s tail, and the incense he wears in his hood. In addition, Hänsele carries a heavy whip; prior to &quot;Fastnacht&quot;, groups of uncostumed Hänseles gather in the market square to practice snapping their whips.

===Market Day===

Wednesdays and Saturdays are traditional market days in Überlingen, and have been since the late 14th century when the city was granted market rights. Today&#x27;s 21st century Market Days bring farmers, fruit growers, wine and brandy producers, honey producers, from throughout the region; in addition to local growers and producers, some come from the Three Corner area by Basel, and others from the Tyrol. Typically, housewives will purchase cheese, bread, wine, fruits and vegetables from these sellers, although items are also available in grocery stores (which sell everything), and specialty stores, which sell single types of items: bakeries, butchers, greengrocers, wine merchants, etc.

Market on Saturday lasts until early afternoon, and participants set up stalls in the market place and the adjacent church plaza. It is complete with a hurdy-gurdy organist, and occasionally other street performers. Sales also include flowers, baskets, and an expanded array of homemade items, including items from local artisans. Market on Wednesday is a smaller affair, and closes early at 1300.

===Christmas Market===

The Überlingen Christmas Market, also called &quot;Weihnachtsmarkt&quot;, and &quot;Christkindlmarkt&quot;, begins with the celebration of St. Nikolaus day, December 6. Nikolaus is the patron saint of Überlingen. A Nikolaus figure, complete with attendees including Black Peter, travels from Constance by boat, arriving at the city&#x27;s boat landing. The &quot;saint&quot; leads a procession to the church, and then offers a special mass, particularly for children. In the ensuing 10 days, vendors offer a variety of merchandise from stalls in the Market square: delicately carved wooden ornaments, baskets, leather items, tree decorations, and all kinds of food and treats are available, such as Fladeln, or Wähe, or Wähefladel (more or less Swabian pizza), and the more widely known Würst (sausage), Kraut (cabbage), and Spätzle (little noodles). There is always Glühwein (mulled wine), a heated wine with fruit zest, usually orange peel, and spices, usually cinnamon and cloves.

===The Sweden Procession===

To commemorate the victory over the Swedes in 1634, Überlingen holds an annual procession called the Sweden Procession. The event actually has two components, one in early May and the second in mid-July. Men and women dress in the traditional costume, &quot;Tracht&quot;, and march in a procession around the city&#x27;s inner perimeter, the inner wall. A select group of individuals carry the &quot;Swedenmadonna&quot;, a figure of Mary gilded in silver in 1659.

At designated places (the entry to the old pilgrim church, several gates, and the fountain where Mary appeared to chase the Swedes away) the priest offers special prayers and a small cannon is fired. The city band plays music to accompany the procession. At the July procession, a company of men perform the &quot;Swertletanz&quot; (small sword dance) at the church plaza, for the priest, and at the market place, for the mayor.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Überlingen is twinned with:
* Chantilly, France (1987)
* Bad Schandau, Germany (1990)

==Hamlets and villages==
*&quot;Andelshofen&quot; was first mentioned in 1239 as Andelsowe. The site was the property of the Knights of St. John (Order of Malta). In 1552 and again in 1634, the site was burned to the ground, and later rebuilt. Judicial authority over the village lay with Überlingen. In 1805 Baden annexed Andelshofen, and it was reorganized into a part of the Überlingen administrative district. In 1927, the commune was dissolved and Andelshofen was incorporated into the commune of Überlingen. Its various hamlets came under the administrative jurisdiction of other small towns: Hagenweiler to Lippertsweiler, Schonbuch to the commune of Bambergen.
*&quot;Aufkirch&quot; was first mentioned in 1242 as Ufkilche. The site was the location of the original Parish Church of Überlingen, St. Michael. The church with its surrounding territory was transferred in 1311 to the Engelberg Abbey, and in 1343 to the Teutonic Order on the Island of Mainau. These came to Überlingen in 1557. From then, the church became a filial parish of the Munster in Überlingen, and village territory went to Überlingen with the status of hamlet.
*&quot;Bambergen&quot; was first mentioned in 1268. In the 13th and 14th centuries the seat of Regentsweil estate, its property came to the &quot;Spital&quot; in Überlingen in 1352. The free imperial city of Überlingen exercised both low and high justice over Bambergen and a few smaller nearby hamlets, including Reuthemühle. Accordingly, Bambergen was the seat of several villages and hamlets belonging to the Überlingen Spital. In 1803 Baden annexed the territory and it was reorganized into the jurisdiction of Überlingen.
*&quot;Bonndorf&quot; was first mentioned in 800 as Pondorf. In the 12th century, became part of the Hohenfels estate. Between 1423 and 1479 it was sold to the Spital, and thus came under the authority of the city. In 1803, Baden annexed the territory and merged it with the community in the administrative district of Überlingen.
*&quot;Nesselwangen&quot; was mentioned in 1094 as Nezzelwanc. Later, the site came into the possession of the Monastery of All Saints, in Schaffhausen. Later it was part of the lordship of Hohenfels, and from them it came into the possession of the Überlingen spital. In 1803, it was annexed by the Duchy of Baden and incorporated into the jurisdiction of Überlingen.
*&quot;Walpertsweiler&quot; was originally known as &quot;Waltprechtesweiler&quot; in 1160, when it belonged to the Cirstercian Monastery in Salem. In 1415 it came into the possession of the Überlingen spital and since the annexation by Baden (1803) is part of the community of Bonndorf.

<text>USS &quot;McCall&quot; (DD-28) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and later in the United States Coast Guard, designated CG-14. She was the first ship named for Edward McCall.

&quot;McCall&quot; was laid down on 8 June 1909 by the New York Shipbuilding Company, Camden, New Jersey, launched on 4 June 1910, sponsored by Miss Jessie Willits, and commissioned on 23 January 1911.

==United States Navy==
Attached to the Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;McCall&quot; operated along the Atlantic coast, primarily out of Newport, Rhode Island and the Chesapeake Bay area. Each winter found her with the fleet in Cuban waters for maneuvers.

In 1916, &quot;McCall&quot; made Neutrality Patrols off New York and along the New England coast. On 14 June 1917, following overhaul at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she steamed to New York to escort a troop convoy to Europe. The destroyer continued escort duties in the western Atlantic until January 1918, when she sailed for Queenstown, Ireland. Arriving there on 22 February, she provided escort and rescue services until 16 December.

Upon return to the United States in January 1919, she resumed east coast operations until decommissioning at Philadelphia on 12 December 1919 and placed in the reserve fleet.

==United States Coast Guard==
&quot;McCall&quot; was transferred to the United States Coast Guard on 7 June 1924 and commissioned into service 17 June 1925 after a lengthy overhaul. Stationed at New London, Connecticut, she was part of the Rum Patrol. The Coast Guard decommissioned her 12 August 1930. She was returned to the Navy on 18 October 1930, and was scrapped and sold on 2 May 1934, in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

<text>The Kolchuga (Кольчуга &quot;Chainmail&quot;) passive sensor is an electronic-warfare support measures (ESM) system developed in the Soviet Union and manufactured in Ukraine. Its detection range is limited by line-of-sight but may be up to for very high altitude, very powerful emitters. Frequently referred to as &quot;Kolchuga Radar&quot;, the system is not really a radar, but an ESM system comprising three or four receivers, deployed tens of kilometres apart, which detect and track aircraft by triangulation and multilateration of their RF emissions.

==History==
Kolchuga was developed in the 1980s by the Rostov military institute of GRU and Topaz radioelectronic factory in Donetsk. Manufactured since 1987, 44 units were produced before 1 January 1992, and 14 of them were left in Ukraine.

After the break up of the Soviet Union, Kolchuga-M was modernized by the Special Radio Device Design Bureau public holding, the Topaz holding, the Donetsk National Technical University, the Ukrspetsexport state company, and the Investment and Technologies Company. It took eight years (1993–2000) to conduct research, develop algorithms, test solutions on experimental specimens, and launch production. The relatively low-cost Ukrainian Kolchuga-M passive radar station is able to detect and identify practically all known active radio devices mounted on ground, airborne, or marine objects.

==Mode of operation==
Kolchuga is an electronic support measures system that employs two or more sites to locate emitters by triangulation. The system is vehicle mounted and comprises a large vertical meshed reflector, with two smaller circular parabolic dishes beneath and a pair of VHF-to-microwave log periodic antennas above. The dishes may exploit amplitude monopulse techniques for improved direction finding, whilst the angled spacing of the log-periodic antenna suggests that they may use phase interferometry to improve angle measurements. Various smaller antennas, presumably for inter-site communications are to the side and rear of the dish.

The detection range is one of the best in its class, but it is highly dependent on the emitted power of the transmitter being tracked, and requires satisfaction of the line of sight condition to at least two receiving sites for triangulation (compared with three sites for a multilateration system such as the VERA passive sensor). A Kolchuga complex can detect and locate air and surface targets and trace their movement to a range generally limited only by the &quot;common&quot; line-of-sight of the stations. Assuming no terrain masking, the line-of-sight range of a single Kolchuga station (in km) is approximately:
:formula_1

where &quot;hr(km)&quot; is the height of the radar in km, and &quot;ht(km)&quot; is the height of the target in kilometres, and assuming standard atmospheric radio refraction. Thus, for a Kolchuga at 100 m altitude (above local terrain) and a target at 10 km (30 kft), the range of the system would be approximately 450 km. For targets at altitudes of 20 km (60 kft) the line of sight limitation would be 620 km—but few targets fly at such altitudes. Being line-of-sight limited, the system is an effective early warning air defense system against high power emitters.

===System parameters===
According to the manufacturer&#x27;s brochure (from AIDEX 1997), the upgraded Kolchuga-M is equipped:
*With four antennas in the VHF, UHF and SHF radio bands with narrow and wide beams
*With parallel receivers allowing the instant discovery and analysis of signals of radio technical equipment (RTE) in the range 100 MHz -18 GHz and continual tracking across the entire band. [Other sources claim from 130MHz to 18GHz, and a 36 channel preset receiver].
*With sensitivity of approximately -145 dBW
*With equipment for the analysis, processing and continual calculation and tracking of coordinates by triangulation and chronometrical-hyperbolic method.
*With equipment for the identification, operative displaying of information, long term memory and recording of the results of processing.

The brochure also claims that the system provides:

*The detection, analysis of signals with pulsed and continuous waves and resolution of practically all known radio technical equipment (RTE) deployed on ground, sea and air platforms, including radar units of all classes, identification systems, air traffic control system and navigation systems
*The composition, character of operation and flight paths of RTE in a zone 600 km deep with complete exception of blind zones and continual high accuracy
*The detection of take-off of aerial targets and their formation in groups at a distance exceeding that of modern radars.
*The direction of arrival of solitary and group targets and target indication to active facilities of anti-aircraft systems
Special inhibitory sorters omit up to 24 interfering signals, and tracking sorters make it possible to synchronously sort out and track signals from 32 targets;

===Target identification===
Kolchuga is able to detect and identify many types of radio devices mounted on ground, airborne, or marine objects. Target detection relies only on an emitter having sufficient power and being within Kolchuga&#x27;s frequency range. Target identification, however, is more complex and is based on the measurement of different parameters of the transmitted signal—such as its frequency, bandwidth, pulse width, pulse repetition interval, etc. Kolchuga has been reported to use around forty different parameters when identifying a target. These parameters are compared to a database in order to identify both the type of emitter and, in some cases, even the specific piece of equipment (by identifying the unique signature or &quot;fingerprint&quot; that most transmitters have, due to the variations and tolerances in individual components). The database within Kolchuga is said to have the capacity to store around three hundred different types of emitter and up to five hundred specific signatures for each type.

==Exports==
Pakistan has expressed interest in purchasing the Kolchuga radar. Ukraine has offered it to Pakistan to counter India&#x27;s Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar.

In 2002 the U.S. State Department accused Ukraine of selling Kolchuga to Iraq, based on recordings of the then Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma supposedly made by Mykola Mel&#x27;nychenko. This was followed by political steps from United Kingdom and the United States. No material confirmation has been found in Iraq. See Cassette Scandal for further information.
Unconfirmed reports in September 2006 suggested a sale was made to Iran although this was denied by the Ukrainian government.

On 20 January 2019, Ukrainian news Sources confirmed a Sale of Systems to Israel and Saudi Arabia.

=== Vietnam ===
 is a confirmed operator of the Kolchuga system. It has reportedly acquired 4 systems with the unit price of $27 million.

Even though the mentioned figures could be inaccurate or varied, the systems have been formally commissioned by the Vietnamese Air Defense - Air Force Service.

==Rumours and speculation of performance==
Since becoming publicly known following the Cassette Scandal, the capabilities of Kolchuga have been the source of many rumours and uninformed speculation. Many observers have a tendency to credit it with magical powers of detection. Many of these do not stand up to detailed engineering analysis, or have not been confirmed, but are recorded in this section for completeness, together with reasons for doubting the claim. Note that the material in this section should not be regarded as accurate. Claims include:
* That Kolchuga has a range of 800 km. It will certainly have the sensitivity to see high power sources at such a range. However, basic line-of-sight arguments outlined in the sections above show that this would require aircraft to be flying at impractically high altitudes and/or for the Kolchuga stations to be deployed on very high mountains. The claim is thus technically possible but operationally very unlikely.
* That Kolchuga can detect US stealth aircraft by their radio and radar emissions. Whilst technically possible, stealth aircraft do not radiate when in battle, so this mode of operation is militarily irrelevant.
* Kolchuga is sufficiently sensitive to detect US stealth aircraft from unconventional sources of RF emissions, including radiation from exhaust trails and electromagnetic interference from the engine. (Technically the power levels of these sources are likely to be so small, if at all, that there would be insufficient energy for Kolchuga to measure these effects at one site, let alone the two or more required for triangulation. They would also be almost impossible to distinguish for normal background RF noise and would not appear like the conventional emissions types Kolchuga is designed to receive and analyse).
* Kolchuga is sufficiently sensitive to operate as a bistatic radar receiver and hence exploit other transmitters in the environment. (This is likely to be true for the specific case of forward scatter in which the radar cross section of even a stealth aircraft can become very large for a few moments. However, achieving forward scatter simultaneously in two or more receivers is geometrically impossible, so triangulation would not work. Secondly, unless Kolchuga has been specifically designed to work as a bistatic radar receiver with a certain radar type—and there&#x27;s no evidence of Kolchuga being deployed in conjunction with specific radar types—then it will lack the essential matched filter required to reliably detect reflected pulses in the presence of noise. Therefore, if this effect works at all, it is likely to be unreliable and fleeting).
* Ukrainian sources often make claims such as &quot;[Kolchuga] is head and shoulders above all American, Russian, French, Czech, or Brazilian developments in this field&quot;. Such claims are unsubstantiated and pure speculation, as the performance and even existence of many ESM systems are highly classified and not deducible by ELINT. It may or may not be true, but must be regarded with caution, particularly as those making the claims are often either journalists or those with an interest in exporting the system.

<doc id="1296445" wikidata="Q2053078" url="?curid=1296445" title="Julius No">
<text>Dr. Julius No is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1958 &quot;James Bond&quot; novel and its 1962 film adaptation &quot;Dr. No&quot;, the first of the series, in which he was portrayed by Joseph Wiseman.

==Novel biography==
The novel explains that Dr. No was born in Peking to a German Methodist missionary and a Chinese girl, but was raised by his aunt. As an adult, he went to Shanghai, where he was involved with the Tongs, Chinese crime syndicates. Later he was smuggled to the United States and settled in New York City, where he became a clerk and eventually Treasurer for a Tong in America, called the &quot;Hip-Sings&quot;.

In the late 1920s, a mob war broke out in New York, forcing the police to crack down on them. No stole a million dollars in gold from the Tongs and disappeared. But the Tongs tracked him down and tortured him to find the location of the gold. When No refused to tell them, the Tongs cut off his hands, shot him through the left side of the chest and left him for dead. No survived, due to a condition called dextrocardia, in which his heart is on the right side of the body.

No spent a long time in hospital, then enrolled in medical school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He adopted the title of Doctor and changed his name to Julius No, symbolic of his rejection of his father, whose given name was Julius. As in the film, No fits himself with metal manual prostheses, but the book describes them as simple pincers. In physical appearance, Dr. No is tall and very thin. He is described as being at least 6 inches taller than Bond, who is six feet tall, meaning that he&#x27;s probably around 6 ft 6 inches (198 cm) in height. His head is said to be shaped like a &quot;reverse oil drop&quot;, due to his round head, pointed chin and the yellowish tinge of his skin. He also mentions that while in school, he did not make use of his metal hands, replacing them with waxen ones which were less useful but gave himself a more human appearance. In the novel he wears a gunmetal coloured kimono; due to his inability to hold a bell, he uses a walkie-talkie which he carries around his neck. He also wears one of the first ever pair of contact lenses, and has had a lip slice cosmetic surgery, as well as wearing stacked-heel shoes in order to make himself taller. All of these factors were employed by No to conceal his identity from the Tongs.

With the million dollars from the Tong, he purchases rare stamps in order to preserve his money against inflation; he later purchases the island of Crab Key, off the coast of Jamaica, where he restarts a defunct guano business as a cover for his criminal operations. He employs Jamaican and Cuban laborers for his guano business, which is a mixed blessing for them. The workers are brutally supervised by Jamaican &quot;Chigroes&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;Chinese&quot; and &quot;Negroes&quot;, referring to their mixed ancestry), however they are paid good wages and given decent accommodations. No one who comes to the island is allowed to leave.

No, with aid from the Soviets, sabotages the nearby tests of American missiles by jamming their signals and making them land and explode on a different target than that planned. This forces the Americans to spend time and money redesigning their missiles. He also recovers unexploded missiles from the ocean and turns them over to the Russians. No also admits there is more at play than the shopworn East-West rivalry; his intent is to create enmity between the USSR and USA in an attempt to make the Cold War hot. This was further revealed in Ernst Stavro Blofeld&#x27;s master plan using the &quot;three fighting fish&quot; as an analogy; when the Cold War ended, SPECTRE would then engage in sabotage and subversion against the victor, now weakened from the war.

Bond does not actually learn of No&#x27;s plot until he and Quarrel—with Honeychile Rider, who would trespass to find shells—had infiltrated Crab Key and been captured. Bond had gone there after Commander Strangways had disappeared, murdered by No&#x27;s henchmen. Bond eventually kills No by suffocating him in a mound of guano.

===Henchmen in the novel===
*Miss Taro
*Miss Chung
*Sister Rose
*May
*Riker
*Other various &quot;Chigroes&quot;
*The Three Blind Mice

==Film biography==
Dr. No is a brilliant scientist with an implied Napoleon complex, and an example of the mad scientist trope. He is a self-described &quot;unwanted child of a German missionary and a Chinese girl of a good family&quot;. He later &quot;became treasurer of the most powerful criminal society in China&quot;; in this case, the Tongs. He then &quot;escaped to America with $10,000,000&quot; of Tong gold bullion. He specialized in radiation, which cost him both of his hands; they were replaced with crude bionic metal ones. No&#x27;s hands have great strength (he can crush a metal figurine with them) but are lacking in manual dexterity which leads to his demise.

He offered his skills and expertise to the Americans, and then the Soviets, but was rejected by both superpowers. To get revenge, No joined the criminal organization SPECTRE and relocated to his island of Crab Key in Jamaica.

When Bond is sent to investigate the murder of two British agents and any possible connection with recent rocket disasters, No orders several attempts on 007&#x27;s life. He is particularly displeased with henchman Professor Dent&#x27;s failures, such as through the chauffeur Jones. He gives Dent a venomous spider, which is released in Bond&#x27;s room whilst he sleeps; however, Bond wakes up, kills it, and lures Dent to a private house, where Dent is interrogated and then shot twice by Bond.

No fails in his own attempts to kill Bond; first, inadvertently, by locking him in a ventilation shaft, which is variously heated and filled with water; and then, deliberately, by beating him with his metal hands.

No captures Bond and Honey Ryder when they trespass on his island, and they are put through a decontamination shower since No&#x27;s henchmen detected radiation on them. Inviting them to dinner at his private apartment, he offers Bond a position in his organization, but Bond refuses. Bond escapes through a ventilation shaft (and avoiding the obstacles of heat and flooding), and disguises himself with a radiation suit. Bond enters the control area where No and his assistants are preparing to disrupt the launch of an American rocket. Bond sabotages No&#x27;s swimming pool reactor, allowing the American missile to launch successfully while No and most of his henchmen do not understand it. When No observes Bond&#x27;s sabotage, the two men fight while the other personnel flee the imminent explosion. They fall onto a small platform that slowly descends into the boiling coolant of the overheating reactor. Bond manages to climb out, but No cannot get a grip on the metal framework, due to his metal hands, and falls to his death. Bond frees Honey from where she has been chained in a room filling with water, and escapes before the reactor explodes.

SPECTRE learned of the death of Dr. No and they vowed revenge on James Bond, which led to the events in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. This also set up the recurring battles of James Bond with SPECTRE in the future films.

===Henchmen in the film===
*Miss Taro – arrested
*Professor Dent – shot by Bond
*Annabel Chung
*Mr. Jones – poisoned himself with a cyanide laced cigarette
*The Three Blind Mice – Explosion in car falling off cliff
*Sister Rose
*Sister Lily
*Jamaican guards

==Other appearances==
In the Daily Express James Bond comic-strip series by Yaroslav Horak and Jim Lawrence, Dr. No reappears in the story-line &quot;Hot-Shot&quot;, published between January 16, 1976 - June 1, 1976. In it, Dr. No had survived his previous encounter with James Bond and has remerged as a wealthy Indian businessman named Mr. Huliraya, who serves as the main antagonist of the story.

Dr. No made several appearances in the cartoon series &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot;. His skin, however, was rendered bright green similar to the Mandarin in &quot;Iron Man&quot; possibly due to the chemicals he was exposed to in the film. (In reality there was a mandate to try and not include too many ethnic characters as villains in cartoons, so quite a few Asian looking characters were given green skin like Dr. No, the Mandarin or Ming the Merciless in &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;.)

Julius No also appeared in the video game &quot;&quot; (almost-completely unrelated, especially in the meaning of the title, to the 1995 film), voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. Despite his death in both the book and film, he appears alongside fellow enemies Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Auric Goldfinger, Francisco Scaramanga and Xenia Onatopp. In the game, Xenia Onatopp works for No and he seems to possess a considerable army of well-equipped henchmen as well as numerous tanks and helicopter gunships that resemble V-22 Ospreys. He also seems to have soldiers placed on countless rooftops and buildings in Hong Kong. He is electrocuted by his own reactor in a fight with the rogue 00 agent &quot;GoldenEye&quot;.

Julius No is also a multiplayer character in the video game &quot;007: From Russia with Love&quot; and is a playable multiplayer character in the 2010 video game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; for the Wii.

The character of Dr. No makes a brief appearance in a 2012 Heineken beer commercial to promote the release of the twenty-third Bond film, &quot;Skyfall&quot;.

===Non-official &quot;James Bond&quot; media===
In &quot;Myths for the Modern Age: Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton Universe&quot; (Win Scott Eckert, ed., MonkeyBrain Books, 2005), Win Scott Eckert contributes &quot;Who&#x27;s Going to Take Over the World When I&#x27;m Gone?&quot; wherein he posits that No&#x27;s mother was an agent of Fu Manchu named Madame de Medici, who was in turn the daughter of Fu Xi, from Sax Rohmer&#x27;s novel &quot;The Golden Scorpion&quot;. Likewise in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;, No is stated as being a distant relative of Fu Manchu. Later in the book, it is revealed that Bond&#x27;s mission to stop Dr. No was a fraud, an alibi for Bond to kill a British leader for the Americans — &quot;There was No Doctor.&quot;

In the alternate history novel &quot;Dracula Cha Cha Cha&quot;, Dr. No (along with Mr. Big) is mentioned as being vampire elders killed and drained by the Diogenes Club agent Hamish Bond.

==Cultural references==
During the 1981 Ontario general election Progressive Conservative Premier Bill Davis mocked the Liberal leader Dr. Stuart Smith and his critical attitude towards the government by calling him &quot;Dr. No&quot;. &quot;Dr. No&quot; was also used as the nickname of Northern Irish unionist politician Ian Paisley, due to his long-standing opposition to making concessions to Northern Ireland&#x27;s Catholic community and to Irish nationalism. Similarly, American Republican politician and physician Tom Coburn was also known as &quot;Dr. No&quot; for his frequent opposition to legislation in the United States Congress, particularly bills which would increase federal spending. This nickname was also given to Representative Ron Paul for voting similarly against many bills, as well as his background as a medical doctor. In South Africa, right wing MP Andries Treurnicht was also known as &quot;Dr. No&quot; due to his staunch rejection of liberalisation of apartheid.

Art critic Lawrence Alloway compared the pessimistic and gory writing of British art critic Robert Melville about artist Francis Bacon to the speech patterns of Dr. No in &#x27;DR. NO&#x27;S BACON&#x27;, &quot;Art News and Review&quot;, 9 April 1960.

<text>Herta-Maria Perschy (23 September 1938 – 3 December 2004) was an Austrian actress whose career included performances on screen with actor Rock Hudson and on American television in both daytime and prime time.

== Early life ==
Perschy was born in Eisenstadt, then part of Nazi Germany, now in Burgenland, Austria and moved to Vienna at the age of 17 to study acting.

== Career ==
After completing her education, she moved to West Germany for more training, leading to a film career. Her first major success came with &quot;Nasser Asphalt&quot; where she played together with Horst Buchholz. Her acting career would eventually take her — by way of France, Italy and the United Kingdom — to Hollywood. Perschy played in a number of American films, her most notable roles being in the 1962 biopic &quot;Freud&quot;, the 1964 Rock Hudson comedy, &quot;Man&#x27;s Favorite Sport?&quot;, and the 1964 hit war movie &quot;633 Squadron&quot;. Perschy&#x27;s career in America eventually declined and by the late 1970s her only US appearances were brief roles in TV shows such as &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

While shooting in Spain in 1971, Perschy suffered a burn injury from an accident that required several operations before she could resume her career. Perschy returned to her native Austria in 1985 and continued to perform in a series of plays and TV series.

In 1969, she filmed &quot;Castle of Fu Manchu&quot; with Christopher Lee and Richard Greene. When it aired on television in New York City four years later, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that the film would be &quot;[w]ell worth viewing, if it&#x27;s as sharp and fast as others in this new series&quot;.

== Death ==
On 3 December 2004, Perschy died of cancer in Vienna.

<doc id="1296461" wikidata="Q6916613" url="?curid=1296461" title="Moss v. Bush">
<text>Moss v. Bush (Supreme Court of Ohio Case Nos. 04-2055 and 04-2088) was a lawsuit filed by 37 voters in the U.S. state of Ohio, challenging Ohio&#x27;s certified electoral college votes in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. It was filed on 13 December 2004, and dismissed at the plaintiffs&#x27; request following the acceptance of Ohio&#x27;s votes by the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate on January 6, 2005. The suit was headed by Cliff Arnebeck of the Alliance for Democracy.

Following the dismissal, Arnebeck&#x27;s group filed a motion to intervene in a federal case brought on Election Day by the Ohio Democratic Party against Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell. That motion was opposed by the Ohio Democratic Party and ultimately denied.

==Details of the case==

The case challenged Ohio&#x27;s certification of its electoral votes, which had been awarded to George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, the candidates on the Republican Party ticket. The plaintiffs alleged that there had been widespread systematic election fraud that altered the outcome of the election. On that basis, the suit asked the courts to set aside the certified results, and, possibly, award the state&#x27;s electoral votes to John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, the candidates on the Democratic Party ticket. If successful, shifting Ohio&#x27;s 20 electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election would have had the effect of shifting the overall election from Bush to Kerry. The case was ultimately dismissed. &quot;See generally&quot; 2004 United States presidential election, results.

===Litigation===

Following the November election, Ohio&#x27;s electors were scheduled to meet and cast their votes for President Bush on 13 December 2004. On that same day, various Ohio citizens (the &quot;Contestors&quot;) filed an Election Contest Petition alleging fraud in the conduct of the Ohio election and a Motion for Temporary restraining order and Preliminary injunction seeking to prevent Ohio&#x27;s electors from meeting or casting their vote before completion of the Election Contest.

On 16 December 2005, Justices&#x27; Thomas Moyer and Maureen O&#x27;Connell, in separate opinions, dismissed &quot;Moss v. Bush I&quot; without prejudice to refiling the action as two separate cases. Both Justice Moyer and Justice O&#x27;Connell ruled that Ohio election law did not permit Contestors to challenge the election of two different officials in a single Petition.

On 17 December, the case was refiled, with it now referring only to the election of Ohio&#x27;s electors for the presidential electoral college. A request was also made that the Court declare the Kerry-Edwards presidential ticket the rightful winner of Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes.

On 12 January 2005, &quot;Moss v. Bush&quot; was dismissed at the Contestors&#x27; request.

===Motion for sanctions===

On 18 January 2005, Ohio&#x27;s Secretary of State filed a motion for sanction against the plaintiffs, alleging that the claim in &quot;Moss v. Bush&quot; was meritless, did not meet the standards of evidence required by law, and was brought only for partisan political purposes.

On 19 May 2005, Chief Justice Moyer denied the motion for sanctions. Justice Moyer concluded that, although &quot;[t]he Contestors indeed made multiple allegations in the complaint that are, at best, highly improbable and potentially defamatory, inflammatory, and devoid of logic&quot; (Paragraph 4), and &quot;[d]espite the apparently scurrilous nature of most of these allegations,&quot; (Paragraph 16), sanctions were not appropriate under Ohio law for two reasons. First, Justice Moyer concluded that unlike civil litigation, the election contest statutes of Ohio do not permit sanctions for meritless charges. (Paragraphs 17-24). Second, because the Contestors dismissed their suit before evidence was gathered, Justice Moyer concluded that even if sanctions were permitted by law, there was not enough evidence before the Court to issue sanctions. (Paragraph 25).

===&quot;Moss v. Moyer&quot;===

On 20 December 2004, the case contesting &quot;...the certification of the election of Thomas Moyer for the office of Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court for the term commencing in 2005.&quot; was refiled. The case is known as Moss v. Moyer, Ohio Supreme Court Case No. 04-2106. Justice Maureen O&#x27;Connor was designated to preside over the matter by Governor Bob Taft.

On 28 December 2004, Justice O&#x27;Connor issued an order stating that under Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), the Contestors were required to plead the alleged acts of fraud in the election for Chief Justice with greater particularity. She ordered that Contestors do so by 7 January 2005, allowed their opponents until 14 January 2005 to respond, and stayed any discovery proceeding pending those pleadings.

On 12 January 2005, &quot;Moss v. Moyer&quot; was dismissed at the request of the Contestors.

<doc id="1296473" wikidata="Q6525386" url="?curid=1296473" title="Leonard Horner">
<text>Leonard Horner FRSE FRS FGS (17 January 1785 – 5 March 1864) was a Scottish merchant, geologist and educational reformer. He was the younger brother of Francis Horner.

Horner was a founder of the School of Arts of Edinburgh, now Heriot-Watt University and one of the founders of the Edinburgh Academy. A &#x27;radical educational reformer&#x27; he was involved in the establishment of University College School. As a commissioner on the Royal Commission on the Employment of Children in Factories, Horner arguably did more to improve the working conditions of women and children in North England than any other person in the 19th century.

==Early life and education==
His father, John Horner, was a linen merchant in Edinburgh, and partner in the firm of Inglis &amp; Horner. Leonard, the third and youngest son, attended the High School and entered the University of Edinburgh in 1799. There in the course of the next four years he studied chemistry and mineralogy, and gained a love of geology from &quot;Playfairs Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory&quot;. At the age of nineteen he became a partner in a branch of his father&#x27;s business, and went to London.

==Career==

In 1808 he joined the newly formed Geological Society of London and two years later was elected one of the secretaries. Throughout his long life he was ardently devoted to the welfare of the society; he was elected president in 1846 and again in 1860. In 1811 he read his first paper &quot;On the Mineralogy of the Malvern Hills&quot; (&quot;Trans. Geol. Soc.&quot; vol. i.) and subsequently communicated other papers on the Brine-springs at Droitwich, and the &quot;Geology of the S.W. part of Somersetshire&quot;.

He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1813. In 1815 he returned to Edinburgh to take personal superintendence of his business, and while there (1821) he was instrumental in founding the Edinburgh School of Arts on Adam Square where the instruction of mechanics and art was taught, and he was one of the founders of the Edinburgh Academy. In 1827 he was invited to London to become warden of London University (now University College London), an office which he held for four years; he then resided at Bonn for two years and pursued the study of minerals and rocks, communicating to the Geological Society on his return a paper on the &quot;Geology of the Environs of Bonn&quot;, and another &quot;On the Quantity of Solid Matter suspended in the Water of the Rhine&quot;. He made significant contributions to the study of loess material and loess deposits and published what is probably the first illustration of a loess section. He also produced the first map of the Siebengebirge region of the Rhineland.

In 1828 he returned to Edinburgh to take charge of his ailing father&#x27;s company. In 1829, on the death of his father, he took full charge of the company, and continued in this role until 1833.

In 1833 he was appointed one of the commissioners to inquire into the employment of children in the factories of Great Britain, and he was subsequently selected as one of the inspectors. He held this post for 26 years and during this time arguably did more to improve the working condition of women and children in the mills of north England than any other person in the 19th-century and for which he was praised by Karl Marx in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. In later years he devoted much attention to the geological history of the alluvial lands of Egypt; and in 1843 he published his &quot;Life&quot; of his brother Francis.

==Family==
Horner married Anna Susanna Lloyd, daughter of Gamaliel Lloyd.

They had six daughters, all of whom educated to a high standard for the age. The eldest, Mary Elizabeth, married Sir Charles Lyell, author of &quot;The Principles of Geology&quot; in 1832. Her younger sister Katharine married Lyell&#x27;s younger brother Henry in 1848, and later edited &quot;The Life, Letters and Journals of Sir Charles Lyell&quot;. A third daughter, Frances, married Charles Bunbury, a noted paleobotanist. A fourth daughter, Leonora, married Georg Heinrich Pertz, a historian and archivist; one of their children was Dorothea Pertz and through this connection Horner was the step-great-great-grandfather of astronomer and astrophysicist Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin. Two other daughters, Susan and Joanna, were known in their day as the authors of a book on walking tours of Florence, Italy.

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in 1803 in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No.2. He was also an honorary member of Lodge Kirknewton and Ratho, No.85, this also being conferred in 1803.

==Death==
He died in Montagu Square in London on 5 March 1864.

<doc id="1296477" wikidata="Q519349" url="?curid=1296477" title="Southern Illinois University Edwardsville">
<text>Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) is a public university in Edwardsville, Illinois, United States. Located within the Metro East of Greater St. Louis, SIUE was established in 1957 as an extension of Southern Illinois University Carbondale. It is the younger of the two major institutions of Southern Illinois University system. SIUE has eight constituent undergraduate and graduate colleges, including those in arts and sciences, business, dentistry, education, engineering, graduate study, nursing, and pharmacy, in addition to the East St. Louis Center.

Most of SIUE&#x27;s students are from Illinois, with out-of-state and international students accounting for 19% of enrollment. SIUE does offer in-state tuition for undergraduate students from all 50 states. The university offers numerous extracurricular activities to its students, including athletics, honor societies, student clubs and organizations, as well as fraternities and sororities. The university has more than 115,000 alumni.

Fielding athletic teams known as the SIU Edwardsville Cougars, the university participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as a member of Ohio Valley Conference (OVC).

== History ==
During the post–World War II economic expansion, a lack of public higher education was noticeable in the growing Metro-East area. Organizations from across the area took it upon themselves to relieve this lack. Southern Illinois University (SIU), over to the region&#x27;s south, opened a residence center in Belleville in 1949. In 1955, the Edwardsville Chamber of Commerce founded the Southwestern Illinois Council for Higher Education (SWICHE), tasked with creating a more permanent solution to the problem. SWICHE and SIU&#x27;s board of trustees met and stated their agreement in goals in 1956, and, that same year, an Executive Committee from the Board of Education in Alton invited Alonzo Myers, Chairman of the Department of Higher Education for Higher Education at New York University, to perform a study of the need for higher education in the Metro-East.

Myers&#x27;s 1957 report, &quot;The Extent and the Nature of Needs for Higher Education in Madison and St. Clair Counties,&quot; outlined the precise need: the 1950 census showed that students in the region in question were only half as likely as those in other regions of the country to finish a four-year college degree program (owing specifically to the lack of a nearby university and the financial difficulties of going to school away from home at other state universities). Businesses in the area were in need of college-trained employees, but were forced to hire outside of the area, especially in the fields of business administration, nursing, education, and industrial technology. Myers concluded that, rather than more residence centers, private schools, or junior colleges, a branch of a four-year public university would best serve the needs of the area. He recommended SIU, the closest large public university, as the best candidate.

Acting on the report, in 1957, SIU purchased both a former building of East St. Louis High School and the campus of Shurtleff College in Alton as temporary facilities. Even with all of the research and planning that had gone before, the true need had been underestimated. When the new campuses opened, officials planned on having about 800 students; 1776 enrolled, and enrollment doubled within two years.

The dual campus solution was temporary mostly because both facilities were in urban areas with little room for expansion even at the time of purchase. Land for the permanent campus was purchased in 1960— of farmland. Money for the purchase came from A) contributions from individuals, businesses, industries, labor unions, civic organizations, and PTAs; B) loans from 14 Metro-East banks; and C) state funding. The location, west of Edwardsville, was chosen due to its accessibility via highways, its usability as an educational campus, and its proximity to the major urban areas of the Metro-East.

In 1960, a bond issue was voted upon by the residents of Illinois; the measure passed by more than 100,000 votes, providing funds for the construction of the campuses of SIUE and the school now known as the University of Illinois Chicago. A conference entitled Environmental Planning-Edwardsville Campus (EPEC) took place in 1961, highlighting the architectural and spatial design of the future campus. The campus was designed by architects Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]. Ground was broken in 1963 and, with the first two buildings (Peck Hall and Lovejoy Library) completed, classes were first held on the Edwardsville campus in fall 1965. A series of dedication ceremonies from 1966 to 1969 highlighted the ongoing growth of the campus.

Prior to the development of the Edwardsville campus, six &quot;Divisions of Academic Programs&quot; were established for the SIU Residential Centers in Alton and East St. Louis on March 4, 1960. When the move was made to the new campus in 1965, the &quot;Divisions&quot; became the Schools of Business, Education, Fine Arts, Humanities, Science and Technology, and Social Sciences. The nursing program, which was to become the School of Nursing when the new campus opened, was established on March 29, 1964. On April 18, 1969, the board of trustees voted to establish the School of Dental Medicine, which opened in 1972. The School of Engineering originated as the Engineering Department of the School of Science and Technology and was elevated to School status in 1982. Between September 9, 1993, and July 1, 1995, the Schools of Fine Arts, Humanities, Sciences, and Social Sciences and the University College merged to become the College of Arts and Sciences. The newest of SIUE&#x27;s schools, the School of Pharmacy, began classes in 2005. In 2014, the School of Education was renamed to School of Education, Health and Human Behavior to better represent the diversity and growth of its academic programs.

During its early days of rapid growth, the school became increasingly independent of its parent school in Carbondale. In 1971, SIU&#x27;s board of trustees made official the campus&#x27;s name of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville.

=== Mississippi River Festival ===
From 1969 to 1980, the SIUE campus hosted the Mississippi River Festival (MRF), a summer outdoor concert series that featured performances by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (which was in-residence on campus during the MRF&#x27;s early years) and high-profile classical, jazz, folk, pop, and rock artists including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Van Cliburn, Aaron Copland, Bob Hope, The Who, Yes, Chicago, Joan Baez, The Eagles, the Modern Jazz Quartet, and The Grateful Dead.
The MRF stage was beneath a large tent which also covered the reserved seating section, with lawn seating outside on the grass of the large natural amphitheater. The MRF attracted crowds of upward of 30,000.

== Campus ==

=== Main campus ===
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville is located on of trees and lakes, making SIUE one of the largest college campuses in the US by land area. The campus is home to a wide variety of university programs and facilities—classroom and labs, arts and theatre spaces, research centers, student housing, and athletic and recreational venues.

The majority of SIUE&#x27;s academic buildings are located in the Core Campus, inside Circle Drive on the south side of the Cougar Lake. Many of the academic buildings were constructed during the 1960s, shortly after the land for the campus was purchased, with major additions during the 1970s. Another building boom has occurred since the turn of the 21st century, as the university experienced enrollment growth and expanded programs.

The center of the Core Campus is the Stratton Quadrangle, named after William Stratton, who served as the governor of Illinois from 1953 to 1961 and was the university&#x27;s first commencement speaker in June 1960. The quadrangle is designed with no direct pathway between two buildings, this provides students with exposure to nature during the commute between buildings. The quadrangle also contains The Rock, which is constantly changing color because student organizations, such as fraternities and sororities, compete to see who can keep it painted their colors the longest. The original Rock, a rose quartz boulder, was donated by the supplier of stone for the original Core Campus buildings. It was stolen during the night of October 7–8, 2003 and was found in pieces nine days later. A replacement Rock of limestone was donated by the Unimin Corporation in 2003, installed on March 14 and dedicated on April 7. The remnants of the original Rock were put on display in the Morris University Center.
The Lovejoy Library is named after Elijah Parish Lovejoy and sits on the north side of the Stratton Quadrangle. It opened in 1965 and now holds over 800,000 volumes of almost 600,000 titles in book form plus over 1.67 million titles on microfilm across its four floors. Three of the university&#x27;s major academic buildings lie to the east of Lovejoy Library and northeast of the quadrangle. Peck Hall is named after John Mason Peck and opened in 1965. It houses the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and the Departments of Anthropology, History, Sociology, Social Work, English, Foreign Languages, Political Science, and Philosophy. Alumni Hall opened in 1976 and was originally known as Classroom Building III. It houses classrooms and the offices of the School of Nursing and of the departments of Speech Communication, Art Education, Art Therapy, Geography, and Public Administration and Policy Analysis. Founders Hall was originally known as Classroom Building II and opened the same year as Alumni Hall. Founders contains various classroom space and is home to the schools of Business and Education and the Army ROTC program.

The Science Building Complex is located to the west of Lovejoy Library and contains the classrooms, labs, and offices of the departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, and Physics as well as the SIUE Center for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Research, Education and Outreach. The Science Lab Building East (originally the Science Building) opened in 1966. Construction of the new Science Lab Building West was begun in late 2009, part of a $72 million project to build it and completely renovate the existing building. The new building opened for use in the Fall of 2013, and the gutting and renovation of the old building is underway with completion originally scheduled for the Fal of 2016. Renovation work on Science Building East was halted in 2015 due to the Illinois budget crisis, but SIUE &quot;forward funded&quot; the work on the two large lecture halls, which were already back in use when work resumed. Science Lab Building West was rededicated in September 2018, the completion late but well under budget.

Dunham Hall opened in 1966 and was expanded in 1995. The building is named after Katherine Dunham and houses the Departments of Music, Mass Communications, Theater and Dance, and the Information Technology Services. In addition to departmental offices, the building houses music studios, theater studios and workshops, the student television studio, a multimedia computer lab, video editing lab, photojournalism dark room, and WSIE-FM and web-radio radio stations. There is also a theater seating approximately 400, with a proscenium stage, orchestra pit, theatrical lighting, and special effect trap doors. The building is located south of the Science building and directly west of the quadrangle.

The Morris University Center is named for former SIU president Delyte W. Morris and opened in 1967. The MUC is the heart of student activity and lies on the southern edge of the Stratton Quadrangle. The facility contains dining halls, restaurants, a ballroom, conference rooms, the university bookstore, a bowling center and game room, a Starbucks coffeeshop, the University Bookstore, and other student services, as well as offices for various student organizations and volunteer activities. The Student Success Center is one of the newest facilities on the SIUE campus. It opened in 2009 and is connected to the MUC. Available to students 24 hours a day, the Success Center houses academic and personal support services all in one convenient location, a study lounge and coffee bar, meeting rooms, and a Mac computer lab. The building also contains the offices of student government, disability support services, academic advancement, health services, a career development center, and international programs. The building was constructed using Green building techniques that includes the use of sustainable and recycled construction materials.

Rendleman Hall is located to the east of the University Center and is named after former SIUE president John S. Rendleman. It opened in 1969 and serves as the main administrative building, housing admission review and processing, the bursar&#x27;s office, and the housing office. Rendleman Hall, since 1970, has also been the location of the branch U.S. Post Office for ZIP code 62026, which serves SIUE&#x27;s campuses in Edwardsville, Alton, and East St. Louis.

Other academic, arts and athletic buildings are located to the west of the campus center. The Theater Department also uses the Metcalf Experimental Theater, a separate building named after James F. Metcalf (father of actress Laurie Metcalf) that opened in 1984 as a replacement for an old Quonset hut that was used for productions. The Engineering Building, opened in 2000 and expanded in 2013–14, houses the SIUE School of Engineering. It includes classrooms, laboratories, and offices for the school and its departments. The Art and Design Building, opened in 1994 and expanded in 2012–13, contains the offices of the Department of Art and Design and its classrooms and studios. The Center for Spirituality &amp; Sustainability, formerly known as the Religious Center was completed in 1971 and is located near the Art and Design Building. It is topped by a plexiglass Geodesic dome which resembles a globe with Edwardsville oriented at the top. The center was designed by R. Buckminster Fuller and internationally known architect, Shoji Sadao, and dedicated by Fuller, who was a visiting professor at SIUE at the time. The 90th Meridian runs through the building.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville campus was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).

==== Athletic facilities ====
The Vadalabene Center (also known as the &quot;VC&quot;), named after state senator Sam M. Vadalabene, opened in 1983 and is the focal point for SIUE athletics, containing many of the university&#x27;s sports facilities. The Vadalabene Center&#x27;s arena was renamed to First Community Arena at the Vadalabene Center by First Community Credit Union in 2021. The company will pay $2.3 million over the next 10 years for the new name. The center was expanded in 1993 with the addition of the Student Fitness Center, which was improved in 2009. It was further expanded in 2008 as SIUE&#x27;s athletics began the transition from NCAA Division II to Division I. Among the changes were an increase in the arena seating from 2,400 to over 4,000. All of the athletics department offices are housed in the Lukas Athletics Annex to the VC, which was opened in 2012. The VC is home to not only Intercollegiate Athletics, but also to Campus Recreation and to the Departments of Kinesiology and Health Education of the School of Education. Korte Stadium and its Bob Guelker Field opened in 1994 and serves the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer and track and field teams. Cougar Field, home of the softball team, and its Fulginiti Indoor practice facility (opened 2012) sits just to the northwest of Korte Stadium. The Simmons Baseball Complex is home to the Cougar baseball team and is located on New Poag Road, west of Stadium Drive, in the northwest corner of the campus. The Cougar Tennis Courts are just west of the Vadalabene Center and the SIUE Cross Country Course is on the north edge of the campus at the intersection of North University Drive and New Poag Road.

==== Student housing ====
Housing consists of several residence halls and Cougar Village, which are the university&#x27;s on-campus apartments. All campus student accommodations are suite-style and furnished. Each contains social lounges and multiple service units such as computer labs and Learning Resource Centers. Student housing surrounds the academic buildings in the central portion of the SIUE campus.

Woodland and Prairie Hall are located on the southern side of campus between Circle Drive and South University Drive. The two serve as freshmen dorms, providing housing for a combined 1,000 students. Woodland Hall opened in 1994 and is the oldest residence hall. It houses 500 freshmen students. The hall is multifunctional and contains conference and meeting rooms. Woodland Hall has a small student café, Woodland Cart, which provides students with food during the week. Freshmen Focused Interest Communities (groups based on common interest or academic majors) are spread out among the three freshmen residence halls. Prairie Hall opened in 1998. It houses 500 freshmen students. Prairie Hall contains meeting rooms and a computer lab, and Freshmen Focused Interest Communities.

Bluff and Evergreen Halls lie to the west of Circle Drive and are the two newest residence halls on the SIUE campus. Bluff Hall opened in 2001 and houses 500 freshmen students. Bluff Hall recently added an Esports Arena into the building. Evergreen Hall is the newest residence hall, opened in 2007, and houses about 500 students. Evergreen is designed for upper-class residents, it features apartment and suite-style living. Students are able to choose from multiple floor plans. The hall also has multiple service facilities, such as fitness center and meeting rooms.

In addition to the traditional, dorm-style residence halls, Cougar Village is a student apartment development that opened in 1970. The complex is located along the eastern shore of Cougar Lake and is composed of around 500 two and three-bedroom apartments in 62 buildings that house approximately 1,500 undergraduate students, graduate students, and family residents. The village was originally called Tower Lake Apartments, after the man-made lake on the north side of campus located behind the water tower and the heating and refrigeration plant. Tower Lake is now called Cougar Lake. Apartments provide multiple floor plans and are a short walk or shuttle ride from the core campus. Cougar Village also includes the Cougar Village Commons Building, located in the middle complex. The Commons contains an information desk, laundry facilities, a lounge, a computer lab, and the Common&#x27;s Grill and Convenience Store. In 2010, a project was developed and approved to remodel eight of the buildings in Cougar Village into a Greek Village, providing on-campus fraternity and sorority houses, but the project was later dropped.

==== University Park ====
University Park is a mixed-use technology park located on the eastern side of the SIUE Campus. It is home to 27 business, industry, and state tenants classified as agricultural-biotechnology, professional services, health sciences and information technology.

The School of Pharmacy Lab houses the SIUE School of Pharmacy and began offering courses to students admitted to the SIUE doctor of Pharmacy program in August 2005. The building is located in SIUE&#x27;s University Park. The School of Pharmacy also has space in the adjacent 200 University Park Building and in the nearby Technology and Management Center and the Biotechnology Laboratory Incubator, which also contains Biology and Chemistry labs, as well as the Geographic Information Systems offices.

The National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) is the world&#x27;s only facility dedicated to researching the ways and means of converting corn (maize) to ethanol. Using emerging technologies, the NCERC contains an analytical lab, a fermentation lab, and a pilot-scale production plant for performing research and training future workers.

==== Additional facilities ====

<text>The Chicago Motor Speedway at Sportsman&#x27;s Park was a motorsports race track, located in Cicero, Illinois, just outside Chicago. It was built in 1999 by a group including Chip Ganassi, owner of Chip Ganassi Racing. In 2002 the oval shaped track suspended operations due to financial conditions in the motorsports industry. The track was also the site of horse races, for which the track was called &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s Park&quot;. The track was one of three racetracks that hosted both NASCAR auto races and horse races (the others are Dover International Speedway and the Syracuse Mile).

==History==
Before 1999, Sportsman&#x27;s Park was one of the premier locations for horse racing in the area. Hawthorne Race Course, located right across the street to the south from the track, is the current host of the Illinois Derby. The two tracks operated together for decades.

In 1999, after the final season of the old Sportsman&#x27;s Park, the main grandstand and infield were completely demolished to make way for the massive grandstand that was to follow.

The track held CART races from 1999 to 2002, the Toyota Atlantic Series, and NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races in 2000 and 2001. Chicago Motor Speedway also held American Speed Association (ASA) races as well as the Mid-Am Racing Series. Traditional horse races remained; this time as dirt was brought in over the racing surface. Problems with the hard surface led to several scratches by trainers and races being canceled.

In 2001, Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet was built in the hopes of attracting more racing fans and upper-level races; all Cicero races were subsequently moved to Joliet and the track closed the following year after the CART event. The few remaining horse races were transferred to Hawthorne.

Portions of the motion picture &quot;Driven&quot; were shot at Chicago Motor Speedway.

In 2003 the town of Cicero purchased the track for $18 million. During 2005 the main grandstands were torn down but the track itself remained.
On October 31, 2008, it was reported that contracts for the demolition of the remaining structures and track had been awarded. 
Demolition of the remaining Sportsman&#x27;s Park structures and the track itself began on January 5, 2009.

The western portion of the site is now a Wirtz Beverage Group distribution center, while the eastern portion is home to a Walmart supercenter, effectively removing any last remains of the track. Part of the parking lot to the west across Laramie Avenue has been converted into a public park.

<text>Crossroads is a 1986 American musical drama film, inspired by the legend of blues musician Robert Johnson. It is directed by Walter Hill from a screenplay by John Fusco, and stars Ralph Macchio, Joe Seneca and Jami Gertz. It features an original score by Ry Cooder featuring classical guitar by William Kanengiser and harmonica by Sonny Terry. Steve Vai appears in the film as the devil&#x27;s virtuosic guitar player in the climactic guitar duel.

Fusco was a traveling blues musician prior to attending New York University Tisch School of the Arts, where he wrote &quot;Crossroads&quot; as an assignment in a master class led by Waldo Salt and Ring Lardner Jr. The student screenplay won first place in the national FOCUS Awards (Films of College and University Students) and was sold to Columbia Pictures while Fusco was still a student.

The film was released by Columbia Pictures on March 14, 1986. It received positive reviews from critics, but was not a financial success.

==Plot==

17-year-old Eugene Martone has a fascination for blues music while studying classical guitar at the Juilliard School in New York City. Researching blues and guitar music brings famed Robert Johnson&#x27;s mythically creative acclaim to his attention; especially intriguing are the legends surrounding exactly how Johnson became so talented – most notably the one claiming he &quot;sold his soul to the Devil at the crossroads&quot;, as well as a famed &quot;missing song&quot; that was lost, supposedly evermore, to the world.

In his quest to find this song, he researches old archived newspaper clippings, learning that Johnson&#x27;s longtime friend, musician Willie Brown, is alive and incarcerated for murder or attempted murder in a nearby minimum security hospital. Eugene goes to see the elderly man, who denies several times that he is &quot;that&quot; Willie Brown. He finally admits his identity after hearing Eugene play some blues (but notes that Eugene &quot;plays with no soul&quot;). Willie then says he knows the missing Robert Johnson tune in question but refuses to give it to Eugene unless the boy breaks him out of the facility and gets him to Mississippi, where he has unfinished business to settle. Eugene agrees and they head south. The boy soon realizes, however, that Willie is constantly running minor scams, such as falsely claiming that he has enough money to cover their bus tickets (although Willie may have done this on purpose, so Eugene would experience some real hardship). With only $40 on them, they end up &quot;hoboing&quot; from Memphis to Mississippi.

During their quest, Eugene and Willie experience the blues legacy of Robert Johnson first-hand, taking part in an impromptu jam session at a &quot;jook joint&quot; (as Willie calls it), where Eugene is given the nickname &quot;Lightning Boy&quot; by Willie because of his musical skill. Eugene jokingly suggests that he himself ought to &quot;sell his soul to the Devil at the crossroads&quot;, Willie angrily slaps him and demands he is not to joke about that.

The pair meet 17-year-old Frances, who is fleeing her abusive stepfather. She hitchhikes with them, and she and Eugene start a relationship. When she abandons them to continue her own journey, Eugene is left heartbroken but with a deeper feeling for the blues. At the same time, Willie confesses that there is no missing Johnson song, but tells the boy that he has proven himself far beyond what learning any blues song could ever teach him.

Using money they collected at the jook joint, Willie helps Eugene buy a portable Pignose amplifier, and a Fender Telecaster. Willie tells Eugene that the secret of playing the blues is using a slide.

They reach a deserted crossroads in rural Mississippi, where Willie reveals his secret: his ability on the harmonica came about because of a deal with the Devil, which he made at this very location. Willie now hopes to end the deal. The Devil, who calls himself Scratch and Legba, shows up and insists that the contract for Willie&#x27;s soul is still valid, even if Willie is dissatisfied with how his life turned out.

Eugene, believing the other two are joking around, steps into the conversation. The Devil offers a challenge: if Eugene can come to a special concert and win a guitar battle against his ringer guitarist, then Willie gets his soul back. If Eugene loses, then Eugene too forfeits his soul. Despite Willie&#x27;s protests, Eugene agrees to the deal. Willie and Eugene are transported to a music hall, where metal-blues guitar master Jack Butler, who also sold his soul for musical ability, is wowing the crowd with his prowess. Eugene, now understanding the situation, receives a mojo bag from Willie to hold in his pocket. He also slips his slide on, giving him a perceived advantage over his opponent.

Eugene and Butler trade flamboyant guitar parts, with each able to top the other. Eventually, Eugene falls back on his classical training, playing a fast and difficult piece that Butler cannot match. Dejected, Butler drops his guitar and strides off, and the Devil tears up Willie&#x27;s contract, freeing the bluesman&#x27;s soul.

Willie and Eugene are transported back to Mississippi, where they start walking again, deciding to head to Chicago to play together. Willie tells Eugene that after their stay in Chicago they must part ways, so Eugene can go out on his own &quot;to take the music somewhere else.&quot;

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===
The script was an original by John Fusco, who had long been interested in blues music. He worked as a blues singer and musician but had been warned by a doctor to rest his voice. In 1981 his girlfriend, who was working at a rest home, told him that an old black man with a harmonica had been admitted. Fusco went to visit him and on the way dreamt up a story about what would happen if the player was a legendary blues player. This gave him the idea for the story. He expanded on the myth of Robert Johnson selling his soul to the Devil at the crossroads. Coincidentally, Johnson was inducted to the inaugural class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1986, while the film was in production.

Fusco wrote the script as his Master&#x27;s Thesis at New York University. It was only his second screenplay. Producer Mark Carliner acted as Fusco&#x27;s independent adviser on it and later helped get it made. Fusco was paid $250,000.

Jami Gertz was cast as the female lead. &quot;She had the warmth I was looking for&quot;, Hill said, &quot;and she was feisty, but I wondered, is she strong enough? She has to put Macchio through the experience of falling in love, and then she has to leave him, to strengthen his character for the movie&#x27;s final showdown. I decided to go with her, and I was amazed by how strong she seemed on the screen.&quot; Guitar specialist Arlen Roth was hired as Macchio&#x27;s musical coach.

Hill was aware of some surface similarities to &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;: &quot;You boil it down, and it sounds like a young kid and a wise old guy and their showdown with evil&quot;, said Hill. &quot;But if you really look at &quot;Crossroads&quot;, it&#x27;s a completely different movie... I knew my most difficult task would be creating real, believable scenes between Macchio and Seneca. They had to be real characters; with an ongoing reality level, to work at all. You have to set the stage, or when your movie shifts gears to fantasy, you lose your audience.&quot;

===Shooting===
Shooting took place on location in Beulah, Mississippi, New York City as well as Hollywood. Blues legend Frank Frost makes a cameo.

&quot;I think the blues still speaks to kids today&quot;, said Ry Cooder, who performed the music with Steve Vai and Arlen Roth. &quot;It&#x27;s so old that it&#x27;s new.&quot;

Cooder says the final duel involving Vai &quot;had to be all mapped out, since we had to carefully choreograph the call-and-response of that guitar duel and use it as playback during the filming. Steve Vai is tremendously scientific when it comes to guitar playing, and was able to adapt to that process.&quot;

The original script ended with Joe Seneca&#x27;s character dying on a Greyhound bus. Director Walter Hill&#x27;s father had died shortly before production commenced, and he found filming this scene difficult, so he also shot a happier ending. Both were tested with audiences; the happy ending was chosen.

&quot;Crossroads&quot; was Robert Judd&#x27;s final film role. He died of stomach cancer in January 1986, two months before the film&#x27;s theatrical release.

==Music==
Ry Cooder spent a year working on the film. He later said:
That was an easy film to understand. We’ve all looked at that myth about a white kid going South, and I knew the sign posts along the way. Old time players, juke joints, the lonely roads you go down... These things are all wordlessly spoken of in blues music, which is an encyclopedia of experience. I had songs in my head that dealt with every scene in &quot;Crossroads&quot;. To mold them into shape for that film was like Blues 101.

Macchio was taught to play guitar by Arlen Roth in preparation for filming. Roth writes that he and Macchio would work together for two hours per day, after which Macchio would work with his karate instructor to prepare for the forthcoming &quot;Karate Kid 2&quot;. Macchio initially hoped to be able to play some of the music on screen himself, but came to realize that the difficult pieces the professional guitarists were preparing would be beyond him.

===Guitar duel===
The climactic guitar duel between Eugene and Butler was originally intended to be a slide-guitar blues contest, with Cooder appearing on screen as Butler, and with Roth dubbing Eugene&#x27;s part. Director Walter Hill decided to replace Cooder and produce a harder &quot;boxing match&quot; style battle, with Keith Richards, Frank Zappa, and Stevie Ray Vaughan considered for the part of Butler. He settled on Alcatrazz player Steve Vai, hoping that the fashionable shred guitar style would increase the film&#x27;s appeal to a wider audience. Cooder was disappointed; he and Roth felt the use of a contemporary musical style was not in keeping with the movie&#x27;s blues theme, and would badly date the film later.

The director shot an additional duel, which was to appear before the final confrontation. This pitted Vai&#x27;s Jack Butler against a blues player portrayed by Shuggie Otis; Otis was to lose this, establishing how threatening Butler was. The producers decided not to use this footage in the final film.

Eugene wins the duel by playing a neoclassical metal composition called &quot;Eugene&#x27;s Trick Bag&quot;, which quotes heavily from violin virtuoso Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s &quot;Caprice No. 5&quot;. This reprises parts of the classical playing that William Kanengiser had dubbed for Eugene at the film&#x27;s beginning; in the final duel, Vai dubs &quot;Eugene&#x27;s Trick Bag&quot; while Macchio mimed on Eugene&#x27;s Telecaster. The identity of the red superstrat guitar that Butler plays on-screen became something of a mystery. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine later uncovered that it was a custom Charvel, built either by Grover Jackson or Charvel builder Mike Shannon, and equipped with DiMarzio pickups and a Floyd Rose tremolo. The guitar was Vai&#x27;s own and, as Butler drops it heavily to the floor, the production team hastily constructed mock-up instruments for the shot. The original guitar, signed by Vai, it is now in the collection of the Hard Rock Cafe company.

Roth later released a recording of the planned final duel, between himself and Cooder, on his SoundCloud channel.

===Soundtrack album===

A soundtrack album was released alongside the film, featuring 37 minutes of the film&#x27;s music. The album does not feature Eugene&#x27;s classical playing (which was performed by William Kanengiser) nor the final duel with Jack Butler. Vai&#x27;s playing, including the duel, is featured on his album &quot;The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1&quot;.

===Music chronology===
==Critical response==
Farliner said, &quot;This is as tricky a picture to market as anything. I was the first one who tried to sell the story. I know how tricky it is... It could be a classic crossover movie. But you could blow that opportunity real quick with a bad campaign.&quot; He thought Columbia had an excellent marketing team and liked that the studio spent $6 million on launching it.

According to Ry Cooder, the film &quot;went down the tubes&quot;. The film managed a domestic total gross of $5,839,031.

As of 2024, the film had a 82% &quot;fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 17 reviews.

Roger Ebert in his review stated that the movie &quot;borrows so freely and is a reminder of so many other movies that it&#x27;s a little startling, at the end, to realize how effective the movie is and how original it manages to feel despite all the plunderings.&quot; He praised the film&#x27;s acting and music, giving the movie 3.5 stars out of 4.

<text>Moritz Hörnes (14 July 1815 – 4 November 1868) was an Austrian palaeontologist.

Born in Vienna, he was educated at the University of Vienna and graduated with a PhD. He then became an assistant in the Vienna mineralogical museum. He was distinguished for his research on the Cenozoic Mollusca of the Vienna Basin and of Alpine regions. Most of his memoirs were published in the &quot;Jahrbuch der K. K. geol. Reichsanstalt&quot;.

In 1864 he introduced the term Neogene to include Miocene and Pliocene, as these formations are not always to be clearly separated: the fauna of the lower division being subtropical and gradually giving place in the upper division to Mediterranean forms. He died in Vienna on 4 November 1868.

In 1860 the mineral hörnesite was named in his honor by Wilhelm Haidinger, with Gustav Adolph Kenngott being its co-describer.

The Florentine Diamond was properly weighed and documented and a plaster copy made of it under his supervision.

His son Dr. Rudolf Hörnes (1850–1912), professor of geology and palaeontology in the University of Graz, also carried on researches among the Cenozoic mollusca, and is author of &quot;Elemente der Palaeontologie&quot; (1884).

<doc id="1296493" wikidata="Q1468650" url="?curid=1296493" title="Media-independent interface">
<text>The media-independent interface (MII) was originally defined as a standard interface to connect a Fast Ethernet (i.e., ) medium access control (MAC) block to a PHY chip. The MII is standardized by IEEE 802.3u and connects different types of PHYs to MACs. Being &quot;media independent&quot; means that different types of PHY devices for connecting to different media (i.e. twisted pair, fiber optic, etc.) can be used without redesigning or replacing the MAC hardware. Thus any MAC may be used with any PHY, independent of the network signal transmission medium.

The MII can be used to connect a MAC to an external PHY using a pluggable connector, or directly to a PHY chip on the same PCB. On older PCs the CNR connector Type B carried MII signals.

Network data on the interface is framed using the IEEE Ethernet standard. As such it consists of a preamble, start frame delimiter, Ethernet headers, protocol-specific data and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The original MII transfers network data using 4-bit nibbles in each direction (4 transmit data bits, 4 receive data bits). The data is clocked at 25 MHz to achieve throughput. The original MII design has been extended to support reduced signals and increased speeds. Current variants include:

* Reduced media-independent interface (RMII)
* Gigabit media-independent interface (GMII)
* Reduced gigabit media-independent interface (RGMII)
* Serial media-independent interface (SMII)
* Serial gigabit media-independent interface (serial GMII, SGMII)
* High serial gigabit media-independent interface (HSGMII)
* Quad serial gigabit media-independent interface (QSGMII)
* Penta serial gigabit media-independent interface (PSGMII)
* 10-gigabit media-independent interface (XGMII)

The Management Data Input/Output (MDIO) serial bus is a subset of the MII that is used to transfer management information between MAC and PHY. At power up, using autonegotiation, the PHY usually adapts to whatever it is connected to unless settings are altered via the MDIO interface.

==Standard MII==
The standard MII features a small set of registers:

* Basic Mode Configuration (#0)
* Status Word (#1)
* PHY Identifier (#2, #3)
* Auto-Negotiation Advertisement (#4)
* Auto-Negotiation Link Partner Base Page Ability (#5)
* Auto-Negotiation Expansion (#6)
* Auto-Negotiation Next Page Transmit (#7)
* Auto-Negotiation Link Partner Received Next Page (#8)
* MASTER-SLAVE Control Register (#9)
* MASTER-SLAVE Status Register (#10)
* PSE Control register (#11)
* PSE Status register (#12)
* MMD Access Control Register (#13)
* MMD Access Address Data Register (#14)

Register #15 is reserved; registers #16 through #31 are vendor-specific. The registers are used to configure the device and to query the current operating mode.

The MII Status Word is the most useful datum, since it may be used to detect whether an Ethernet NIC is connected to a network. It contains a bit field with the following information:

===Transmitter signals===
The transmit clock is a free-running clock generated by the PHY based on the link speed (25 MHz for , 2.5 MHz for ). The remaining transmit signals are driven by the MAC synchronously on the rising edge of TX_CLK. This arrangement allows the MAC to operate without having to be aware of the link speed. The transmit enable signal is held high during frame transmission and low when the transmitter is idle.

Transmit error may be raised for one or more clock periods during frame transmission to request the PHY to deliberately corrupt the frame in some visible way that precludes it from being received as valid. This may be used to abort a frame when some problem is detected after transmission has already started. The MAC may omit the signal if it has no use for this functionality, in which case the signal should be tied low for the PHY.

More recently, raising transmit error &quot;outside&quot; frame transmission is used to indicate the transmit data lines are being used for special-purpose signalling. Specifically, the data value 0b0001 (held continuously with TX_EN low and TX_ER high) is used to request an EEE-capable PHY to enter low power mode.

===Receiver signals===
The first seven receiver signals are entirely analogous to the transmitter signals, except RX_ER is not optional and used to indicate the received signal could not be decoded to valid data. The receive clock is recovered from the incoming signal during frame reception. When no clock can be recovered (i.e. when the medium is silent), the PHY must present a free-running clock as a substitute.

The receive data valid signal (RX_DV) is not required to go high immediately when the frame starts, but must do so in time to ensure the &quot;start of frame delimiter&quot; byte is included in the received data. Some of the preamble nibbles may be lost.

Similar to transmit, raising RX_ER outside a frame is used for special signalling. For receive, two data values are defined: 0b0001 to indicate the link partner is in EEE low power mode, and 0b1110 for a &quot;false carrier&quot; indication.

The CRS and COL signals are asynchronous to the receive clock, and are only meaningful in half-duplex mode. Carrier sense is high when transmitting, receiving, or the medium is otherwise sensed as being in use. If a collision is detected, COL also goes high while the collision persists.

In addition, the MAC may weakly pull-up the COL signal, allowing the combination of COL high with CRS low (which a PHY will never produce) to serve as indication of an absent/disconnected PHY.

===Management signals===


MDC and MDIO constitute a synchronous serial data interface similar to I²C. As with I²C, the interface is a multidrop bus so MDC and MDIO can be shared among multiple PHYs.

===Limitations===
The interface requires 18 signals, out of which only two (MDIO and MDC) can be shared among multiple PHYs. This presents a problem, especially for multiport devices; for example, an eight-port switch using MII would need 8 × 16 + 2 = 130 signals.

==Reduced media-independent interface==
Reduced media-independent interface (RMII) is a standard which was developed to reduce the number of signals required to connect a PHY to a MAC. This helps reduce cost and complexity for network hardware, especially in the context of microcontrollers with built-in MAC, FPGAs, multiport switches or repeaters, and PC motherboard chipsets. The following changes from the MII standard cut the number of required signals from 18 in half to only 9:
* MII&#x27;s two clocks (TXCLK and RXCLK) are replaced by a single clock (REF_CLK) used as a reference for both receiver and transmitter signals.
* The clock frequency is doubled from 25 MHz to 50 MHz, while both data paths are halved from 4 bits to 2 bits. Data is clocked out 2 bits at a time (vs 4 bits at a time in MII) or 1 bit at a time for SNI ( only). Data is still sampled on the rising edge only (i.e. it is &quot;not&quot; double-pumped).
* RXDV and CRS signals are multiplexed into one signal.
* The COL signal is removed.
* RX_ER became optional.
Additionally on multiport devices (such as a switch), MDIO, MDC, and REF_CLK may be shared, leaving 6 or 7 pins per port.
Note: the REF_CLK operates at 50 MHz in both mode and mode. The transmitting side (PHY or MAC) must keep all signals valid for 10 clock cycles in mode. The receiver (PHY or MAC) samples the input signals only every 10 cycles in mode.

===Limitations===
There is no signal which defines whether the interface is in full or half duplex mode, but both the MAC and the PHY need to agree. This must instead be communicated over the serial MDIO/MDC interface. There is also no signal which defines whether the interface is in 10 or mode, so this must also be handled using the MDIO/MDC interface. Version 1.2 of the RMII Consortium specification states that its MDIO/MDC interface is identical to that specified for MII in IEEE 802.3u. Current revisions of IEEE 802.3 specify a standard MDIO/MDC mechanism for negotiating and configuring the link&#x27;s speed and duplex mode, but it is possible that older PHY devices might have been designed against obsolete versions of the standard, and may therefore use proprietary methods to set speed and duplex.

The lack of the RX_ER signal which is not connected on some MACs (such as multiport switches) is dealt with by data replacement on some PHYs to invalidate the CRC. The missing COL signal is derived from AND-ing together the TX_EN and the decoded CRS signal from the CRS_DV line in half duplex mode. This means a slight modification of the definition of CRS: On MII, CRS is asserted for both Rx and Tx frames; on RMII only for Rx frames. This has the consequence that on RMII the two error conditions &quot;no carrier&quot; and &quot;lost carrier&quot; cannot be detected, and it is difficult or impossible to support shared media such as 10BASE2 or 10BASE5.

Since the RMII standard neglected to stipulate that TX_EN should only be sampled on alternate clock cycles, it is not symmetric with CRS_DV and two RMII PHY devices cannot be connected back to back to form a repeater; this is possible, however, with the National DP83848 which supplies the decoded RX_DV as a supplemental signal in RMII mode.

===Signal levels===
TTL logic levels are used for or logic. Input high threshold is and low is . The specification states that inputs should be tolerant, however, some popular chips with RMII interfaces are not tolerant. Newer devices may support and logic.

The RMII signals are treated as lumped signals rather than transmission lines. However, the IEEE version of the related MII standard specifies trace impedance. National recommends running traces with series termination resistors for either MII or RMII mode to reduce reflections. National also suggests that traces be kept under long and matched within on length to minimize skew.

==Gigabit media-independent interface==
The gigabit media-independent interface (GMII) is an interface between the medium access control (MAC) device and the physical layer (PHY). The interface operates at speeds up to , implemented using a data interface clocked at 125 MHz with separate eight-bit data paths for receive and transmit, and is backwards compatible with the MII specification and can operate on fall-back speeds of 10 or .

The GMII interface was first defined for 1000BASE-X in IEEE 802.3z-1998 as clause 35, and subsequently incorporated into IEEE 802.3-2000 onwards.

===Transmitter signals===
There are two transmitter clocks. The clock used depends on whether the PHY is operating at gigabit or speeds. For gigabit operation, the GTXCLK is supplied to the PHY and the TXD, TXEN, TXER signals are synchronized to this. For 10 or operation, the TXCLK is supplied by the PHY and is used for synchronizing those signals. This operates at either 25 MHz for or 2.5 MHz for connections. In contrast, the receiver uses a single clock signal recovered from the incoming data.

===Receiver signals===
===Management signals===
The management interface controls the behavior of the PHY. It has the same set of registers as the MII, except that register #15 is the Extended Status register.

==Reduced gigabit media-independent interface==
The reduced gigabit media-independent interface (RGMII) uses half the number of data pins as are used in the GMII interface. This reduction is achieved by running half as many data lines at double speed, time multiplexing signals and by eliminating non-essential carrier-sense and collision-indication signals. Thus RGMII consists only of 14 pins, as opposed to GMII&#x27;s 24 to 27.

Data is clocked on rising and falling edges for , and on rising edges only for . The RX_CTL signal carries RXDV (data valid) on the rising edge, and (RXDV xor RXER) on the falling edge. The TX_CTL signal likewise carries TXEN on rising edge and (TXEN xor TXER) on the falling edge. This is the case for both and .

The transmit clock signal is always provided by the MAC on the TXC line. The receive clock signal is always provided by the PHY on the RXC line. Source-synchronous clocking is used: the clock signal that is output (by either the PHY or the MAC) is synchronous with the data signals. This requires the PCB to be designed to add a 1.5–2 ns delay to the clock signal to meet the setup and hold times on the sink. RGMII v2.0 specifies an optional internal delay, obviating the need for the PCB designer to add delay; this is known as RGMII-ID.

RGMII version 1.3 uses 2.5V CMOS, whereas RGMII version 2 uses 1.5V HSTL.

==Serial gigabit media-independent interface==
The serial gigabit media-independent interface (SGMII) is a variant of MII used for Gigabit Ethernet but can also carry Ethernet.

It uses differential pairs at 625 MHz clock frequency DDR for TX and RX data and TX and RX clocks. It differs from GMII by its low-power and low pin-count 8b/10b-coded SerDes. Transmit and receive path each use one differential pair for data and another differential pair for clock. The TX/RX clocks must be generated on device output but are optional on device input (clock recovery may be used alternatively). Ethernet is carried by duplicating data words 100/10 times each, so the clock is always at 625 MHz.

==High serial gigabit media independent interface==
The high serial gigabit media-independent interface (HSGMII) is functionally similar to the SGMII but supports link speeds of up to .

==Quad serial gigabit media-independent interface==
The quad serial gigabit media-independent interface (QSGMII) is a method of combining four SGMII lines into a interface. QSGMII, like SGMII, uses low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) for the TX and RX data, and a single LVDS clock signal. QSGMII uses significantly fewer signal lines than four separate SGMII connections.

QSGMII predates NBASE-T and is used to connect multi-port PHYs to MACs, for example in network routers.

The PSGMII (penta serial gigabit media-independent interface) uses the same signal lines as QSGMII, but operates at , which supports five 1 gigabit/s ports through one MII.

==10 gigabit media-independent interface==

10 gigabit media-independent interface (XGMII) is a standard defined in IEEE 802.3 designed for connecting full duplex 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) ports to each other and to other electronic devices on a printed circuit board (PCB). It is now typically used for on-chip connections. PCB connections are now mostly accomplished with XAUI. XGMII features two 32-bit datapaths (Rx &amp; Tx) and two four-bit control flows (Rxc and Txc), operating at 156.25 MHz DDR (312.5 MT/s).

<doc id="1296497" wikidata="Q897733" url="?curid=1296497" title="Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum">
<text>Capsicum annuum&quot; var. &quot;glabriusculum, a chili-pepper variety of &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;, is native to southern North America and northern South America. Common names include chiltepín, Indian pepper, grove pepper, chiltepe, and chile tepín, as well as turkey, bird’s eye, or simply bird peppers (due to their consumption and spread by wild birds; &quot;unlike humans birds are impervious to the heat of peppers&quot;). &quot;Tepín&quot; is derived from a Nahuatl word meaning &quot;flea&quot;. This variety is the most likely progenitor of the domesticated &quot;C. annuum&quot; var. &quot;annuum&quot;. Another similar-sized pepper, &#x27;Pequin&#x27; (also called &#x27;piquin&#x27;) is often confused with tepin, although the tepin fruit is round to oval where as the pequin&#x27;s fruit is oval with a point, and the leaves, stems and plant structures are very different on each plant.

==Description==
Chiltepin is a perennial shrub that usually grows to a height of around , but sometimes reaches . In areas without hard frost in winter, plants can live 35–50 years.

===Fruit===
The tiny chili peppers of &quot;C. a.&quot; var. &quot;glabriusculum&quot; are red to orange-red, usually slightly ellipsoidal, and about in diameter. Some strains of tepin peppers are much closer to perfectly round when fresh. A dried tepin pepper appears quite round even if it was slightly ellipsoidal when fresh. Tepin peppers are very hot, in Scoville Heat Units (SHU) measuring between 465,000–1,629,000, or 325,000–2,469,000 depending on the capsaicinoid ⇨ SHU conversion method.

The tepin can be hotter than the habanero or red savina, with the highest levels seen in green fruit 40-50 days after fruit set.

However and since this pepper is primarily harvested from wild stands in the Mexican desert, the heat level of the fruit can vary greatly from year to year, depending on the amount of natural rainfall that occurs during the time the fruits are forming. Fruit heat levels can be weak during drought years, and normal rainfall years produce the highest heat levels. The heat levels also varies between the green fresh fruits (which are pickled in vinegar), red-ripe fresh fruits, dried whole fruit, and dried fruit with the seeds removed, with heat levels arranged from hottest to mildest in that order. Around 50 tons are estimated to be harvested commercially annually in Mexico, primarily in Sonora.

In Mexico, the heat of the chiltepin is called &quot;arrebatado&quot; (&quot;rapid&quot; or &quot;violent&quot;), because, while the heat is intense, it is not very enduring. This stands in contrast to the domesticated &#x27;Pequin&#x27; variety, which is the same size as the wild tepin, but is oval-shaped, and delivers a decidedly different experience.

The different drying methods used for the tepin and &#x27;Pequin&#x27;, can help tell these peppers apart. Tepins are always sun-dried, whereas the Pequins are commonly dried over wood smoke, and the smell of the smoke in the Pequins can help separate the two varieties. Pequins are not as hot as chiltepins (only about 30,000–50,000 Scoville units), but they have a much slower and longer-lasting effect.

==Habitat and range==
&quot;C. a.&quot; var. &quot;glabriusculum&quot; is native to the Sonoran-Arizonan desert and can be found in Texas, Arizona, Louisiana and Florida in the Southern United States, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and Colombia. It prefers well-drained soils, such as silty or sandy loams, and of annual precipitation in Puerto Rico. It may be found in areas with a broken forest canopy or disturbed areas that lack tree cover if moisture and soil are favorable. Elsewhere, such as in Arizona, it may require the partial shading of a nurse plant.

==Symbolism==
Chiltepin was named &quot;the official native pepper of Texas&quot; in 1997, two years after the jalapeño became the official pepper of Texas.

==Conservation==
In 1999, Native Seeds/SEARCH and the United States Forest Service established the Wild Chile Botanical Area in the Coronado National Forest. Located in the Rock Corral Canyon near Tumacacori, Arizona, the preserve protects a large &quot;C. a.&quot; var. &quot;glabriusculum&quot; population for study and as a genetic reserve.

<text>The Stability EP is a limited edition EP by Indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, released February 19, 2002. The release marks the final appearance of drummer Michael Schorr.

The tracks on &quot;The Stability EP&quot; were originally featured as bonus tracks on the limited edition and Japanese versions of &quot;The Photo Album&quot;.

==Song information==

&quot;Stability&quot; reappears as the closing track to the band&#x27;s 2005 major label debut, &quot;Plans&quot;. The new recording is considerably shorter than the original twelve-minute, mostly instrumental version found on this EP, ending where the vocals end. The version included on &quot;Plans&quot; is titled &quot;Stable Song&quot;. A live rehearsal version of &quot;Stability&quot; can be found on the DVD &quot;Drive Well, Sleep Carefully&quot;, which clocks in at 10:03.

The track &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot; is a Björk cover.

<text>Gabriel Contino (born March 4, 1974), better known as Gabriel o Pensador (Portuguese for &quot;Gabriel the Thinker&quot;) is a Brazilian rapper, writer, and composer known for his conscious lyrics which speak of activism, and issues of race, politics, social problems, and the Catholic church. Gabriel began his music career when he launched a demo tape containing the song &quot;Tô Feliz (Matei o Presidente)&quot; I&#x27;m Happy (I killed the President) landing him a contract with Sony Music. Since then he has released eight albums: &quot;Ainda É Só o Começo&quot;, &quot;Quebra-Cabeça&quot;, &quot;Nádegas a Declarar&quot;, &quot;Gabriel o Pensador&quot;, &quot;Seja Você Mesmo (mas não Seja sempre o Mesmo)&quot;, &quot;MTV ao Vivo&quot;, &quot;Cavaleiro Andante&quot; and &quot;Sem Crise&quot; (this last one was released independently). Gabriel has also written three books: &quot;Diário Noturno&quot;, &quot;Um Garoto Chamado Rorbeto&quot; and &quot;Meu Pequeno Rubro-Negro&quot;. &quot;Um Garoto Chamado Rorbeto&quot; won the &quot;Prêmio Jabuti&quot;, for best Children&#x27;s literature.

==Biography==
Coming from a middle-class family, a unique background among Brazilian rappers, Gabriel, the son of a well known journalist in Brazil, hit fame in 1992 with the song &quot;Tô Feliz (Matei o Presidente)&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m happy, I&#x27;ve killed the president&quot;), the debut single from his first and eponymous album. This song was written in protest of President Fernando Collor de Mello and his corrupt administration. Gabriel&#x27;s mother was Collor&#x27;s press secretary. The same album also yielded other hits, including &quot;Lôrabúrra&quot; (&quot;Dumb Blonde&quot;, shortened) and &quot;Retrato de um Playboy&quot; (&quot;Portrait of a Playboy&quot;), bringing hip hop mainstream attention in Brazil by catering to the middle class. Although rapping about everyday life, Gabriel also found time to talk about social injustices with his fourth single, &quot;O Resto do Mundo&quot; (&quot;The Leftovers of the World&quot;, a pun on the word for &quot;leftovers&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; being the same in Portuguese), a more downbeat track about homeless life, with a purposefully depressive melody and flow. Gabriel was &quot;notorious for his biting attacks on some of the major ills of Brazilian society: poverty, racism, violence.&quot;

His following albums were also commercially successful, with a careful blend of socially relevant tracks mixed with airwave-minded pop anthems. His third album, &quot;Quebra-Cabeça&quot;, was released in 1997 and sold over one million copies. History-minded, Gabriel was highly influenced by other Brazilian music, including bossa nova, samba and MPB, as well as using hip hop&#x27;s traditional methods of sampling jazz, funk and disco (&quot;2345meia78&quot;, for example, sampled Chic&#x27;s &quot;Good Times&quot;).

In 1994, while touring in Portugal, Gabriel&#x27;s song &quot;Lavagem Cerebral&quot; (Brainwashing) was received with much praise. The piece was accepted as &quot;a strong social critique of Brazilian society and of the ideology of the dominating classes.&quot;

Besides his native Brazil, Gabriel, o Pensador is also well known in other Lusophone countries such as Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, and has worked with Portuguese musicians like Sérgio Godinho and General D. In 2004, he recorded his first song in English entitled, Who&#x27;s The Enemy?, that appeared on American rapper Ithaka&#x27;s album, Fishdaddy Flashbacks.

===Other projects===
The musician has also released three books: &quot;Diário Noturno&quot; (Brazil and Portugal; poems and short stories), &quot;Um garoto chamado Rorbeto&quot; (Brazil; fiction poetry for children) &quot;Meu Pequeno Rubro-Negro&quot; (Brazil; about children who support Flamengo, like himself). He has been a juror on the spelling bee contest &quot;Soletrando&quot; (in its second edition) on the program Caldeirão do Huck. 
Concerned about the truancy among a group of boys he helped in Rocinha, in , Rio de Janeiro, Gabriel put his hands to work and created an NGO called &quot;Pensando Junto&quot;(Portuguese for &quot;Thinking Together&quot;), an organization serving a social, educational and cultural purpose for children and youth in the community of Rocinha, providing its participants with access to culture, education, leisure, food, medical, dental and psychological care. The organization offers tutoring and courses for a group of underprivileged children in the Rocinha district, located in Gabriel&#x27;s hometown of Rio de Janeiro, where he still lives in today. Gabriel is also a member of the Dreams Can Be Foundation, a nonprofit charitable supporting organization and a Brazilian NGO dedicated to aiding street children and impoverished youth in Brazil, working in partnership with local organizations and NGOs to provide: education, moral and social development, humanitarian relief, and the offering of opportunities where there were none before.

<doc id="1296505" wikidata="Q543559" url="?curid=1296505" title="Kalle Lasn">
<text>Kalle Lasn () (born March 24, 1942) is an Estonian-Canadian film maker, author, magazine editor, and activist. Near the end of World War II, his family fled Estonia and Lasn spent some time in a German refugee camp. At age seven he was resettled in Australia with his family, where he grew up and remained until the late 1960s, attending school in Canberra. In the late 1960s, he founded a market research company in Tokyo, and in 1970, moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Over the course of twenty years, he produced documentaries for PBS and Canada’s National Film Board. He currently resides in Vancouver, British Columbia.

He is the co-founder of &quot;Adbusters&quot; magazine and author of the books &quot;Culture Jam&quot; and &quot;Design Anarchy&quot; and is the co-founder of the Adbusters Media Foundation, which owns the magazine. He reportedly started &quot;Adbusters&quot; after an epiphany that there was something profoundly wrong with consumerism. It happened in a supermarket parking lot. Frustrated that he had to insert a quarter to use a shopping cart, he jammed a bent coin in so that the machine became inoperable. This act of vandalism was his first (quite literal) &quot;culture jam&quot;—defined as an act designed to subvert mainstream society.

==Life and work==

Born in Tallinn, Estonia, during World War II, Lasn&#x27;s family fled to Germany and he spent several years after the war in a displaced-persons camp before his family were offered resettlement in Australia. In Australia he earned a degree in applied mathematics and then relocated to Tokyo, where he spent five years running his own market-research firm before eventually immigrating to Canada in 1970. Lasn’s life works are applied within the philosophical lens of the French Situationists theory and the philosophy of detournement. His concept pertained to the &quot;rerouting [of] spectacular images, environments, ambiences and events to reverse or subvert their meaning.&quot; Lasn has also contemporized the concept of the Spectacle, in which he applies to explain the thousands of images encountered by consumers on a daily basis.

In an interview with &quot;PRWeek&quot; magazine, Lasn recalls the moment in 1989, as an environmental campaigner, when he realized that all brands carry a &quot;political message&quot;. In response to a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign launched by the forest industry, which sought to reassure the Pacific Northwest that they had nothing to worry about, Lasn and his team developed a 30-second advertisement of their own which would challenge the initial campaign. However, Lasn’s attempt at airing the spot on television ultimately failed, as the TV station refused to sell him any time. Lasn referred to this move as &quot;absurd and unfair&quot; because &quot;even the most innocuous product ad is laden with unspoken and unquestioned political assumptions&quot;, adding that no line exists between product and advocacy ads, and that all ads are political.

===Adbusters===
Inspired by what he saw as the lack of democracy in access to all-power media, Lasn founded &quot;Adbusters&quot;, a bi-monthly radicalizing magazine which lends itself the title of one of the leading voices in global environmentalism, anti-capitalist and anti-consumerist movements. Having worked in market research in Japan in the 1960s, Lasn drew from his personal experience and knowledge to produce publications and campaigns that would employ the necessary tools and techniques to create powerful imagery, stunts, slick graphics and vibrant language to promote his cause.

By taking conventional marketing communication techniques and applying them to anti-consumerism messages, &quot;Adbusters&quot; has created a powerful, global social movement, which takes aim at large-scale industries. Although the company’s headquarters in Vancouver only has ten employees, it has a large global following, with 40,000 paper subscribers and 30,000 online subscribers. Lasn claims that ‘’Adbusters&quot; is the &quot;hub of global activism – it’s the (communication) model of the future&quot;.

==Books and films==
In his first book, &quot;Culture Jam&quot;, Lasn portrays consumerism as the fundamental evil of the modern era. He calls for a &quot;meme war&quot;: a battle of ideas to shift Western society away from consumer capitalism. Lasn, in his book, calls on the values of authenticity, individuality and freedom of expression. He promotes the rebelling of the notion that hierarchies can dictate people’s identities. Essentially, Lasn’s concept of &quot;culture jamming&quot; calls upon consumers to value experiences over possessions, while accusing marketing experts of co-opting these values and &quot;slapping a brand name on them&quot;.

His second book, &quot;Design Anarchy&quot;, calls on graphic designers, illustrators and others to turn from working in service to corporate and political pollution of both the planet and &quot;the mental environment&quot;, and to embrace a radical new aesthetic devoted to social and environmental responsibility.. The book, which in an introduction to Lasn’s notion of &quot;culture jamming&quot;, includes a compilation of some of &quot;Adbuster&quot;’s greatest moments, but with the addition of what Lasn calls a &quot;technical event&quot;, which forces the mind to take notice of something and search for meaning, even if there is no meaning. This &quot;technical event&quot; invites readers to become mindful of their patterns of consumption. Similar to Lasn’s prior book, &quot;Design Anarchy&quot; is a &quot;personal statement, manifesto and textbook&quot;, which takes many of the prominent advertising campaigns found in the &quot;Adbusters&quot; magazine, and reconfigures them to stop &quot;the flow of bits of information long enough to interrupt the spectacle, to promote the jolt, to allow the process of awareness&quot;. In the book, Lasn claims that if members of a society can begin by demarking themselves, then they are able to de-market certain rituals imposed by commercial forces, consequently shifting the ways in which the customer interacts with mass media, the way information flows, and the ways in which meaning is produced, ultimately leading to a break in commercial meaning and a shift to a post-consumerist society.

In his third book, &quot;Meme Wars: The Creative Destruction of Neoclassic Economics&quot;, Lasn prefaces the book by calling on University students to realize that they are being &quot;fooled by the façade&quot; of the capitalist educational system, adding that the lack of incorporation of externalities such as species extinction, resource depletion, climate change, and financial meltdowns has turned the profession into a &quot;target for derision and ridicule&quot;. Lasn challenges students to look beneath the surface of the façade to realize that economics is a &quot;highly contested&quot; and &quot;questionable&quot; field. To do so, Lasn offers two distinct ways for students to approach their academic endeavours: to either &quot;accept the status quo&quot; of the system, or become &quot;an agitator, a provocateur, a meme warrior, and occupier&quot;, calling on students to engage in a paradigm shift within educational institutions. The book includes a series of essays, photographs and advertisements, which support Lasn’s approach to culture jamming.

Lasn made documentary films for 20 years beginning in 1970 - many of them to do with Japan, the homeland of his wife, Masako Tominaga. His award-winning films include:
* &quot;Bears and Man&quot; (Co-writer, editor)
* &quot;Japan Inc: Lessons for North America?&quot;
* &quot;Japanese Woman&quot;
* &quot;Satori in the Right Cortex&quot;
* &quot;The Rise and Fall of American Business Culture&quot;
* &quot;The Autumn Rain: Crime in Japan&quot;

==Activism and views==

Lasn, in collaboration with others of &quot;Adbusters&quot;, came up with the original idea for an Occupy Wall Street (OWS) demonstration, but has been careful not to claim ownership of it. In a CBC TV interview, Lasn described OWS as an example of radical democracy and suggested a local movement might emerge, perhaps Occupy Main Street.
=== On Jews and Israel ===

In March 2004, Lasn published an article in Adbusters claiming that, whereas less than two percent of Americans are Jewish, 26 of the top 50 (from a list of George W. Bush-era neoconservatives) advocating war in Iraq are Jewish (52 percent).

<text>The European Poker Tour (EPT) is a series of poker tournaments created by John Duthie, winner of the inaugural Poker Million tournament. It began in 2004 as part of the worldwide explosion in Texas Hold &#x27;em popularity. Since 2011 the EPT has been sponsored and wholly owned and controlled by PokerStars the online casino and taped by Sunset + Vine for television broadcast across Europe.
By season 4 the buy-in for most EPT events was increased to €8,000 (due to increased popularity and lack of space in participating casinos). At 2007 exchange rates, this is approximately equal to the US$10,000 which is the buy-in for most major poker events.

This single move made the EPT the largest poker tour in the world, eclipsing its nearest rivals significantly. The WSOP was larger, but was only run in Las Vegas.

The final table like most other major poker events is made up of 8 players.

For the first couple of seasons, John Duthie commentated for the show alongside Colin Murray. Since the middle of Season 3, James Hartigan has been the lead commentator, with professional players Greg Raymer, Daniel Negreanu and Victoria Coren Mitchell providing analysis. Hartigan also presents the live webcast from each event. The TV show was first hosted by Caroline Flack, then joined by Natalie Pinkham. Seasons 4 and 5 were hosted by Kara Scott, while Seasons 6 and 7 were fronted by Michelle Orpe. Since Season 8, there have been four different presenters with Kristy Arnett, Sarah Grant, Laura Cornelius and Lynn Gilmartin, with commentators James Hartigan and Joe Stapleton presenting the TV shows.

==2010 EPT Berlin robbery==
On 6 March 2010 four masked men, armed with knives and at least one hand gun robbed the EPT event in Berlin. According to the police, the robbers got away with €242,000. No one was seriously injured, only one guard got a minor cut while trying to detain one of the robbers. The panic which gripped the crowd was briefly captured on the live webcast before the camera cut away. The attackers were caught several days after the robbery and later convicted and sentenced to three years in prison.

==2017 rebranding==
In 2017, the series was discontinued and rebranded as the PokerStars Championship. However, this only lasted one year and the EPT returned in 2018.

==2020 EPT Online==
In 2020, three scheduled stops on the EPT (in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Prague) were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic – a fourth event (in Sochi) continued as planned.

An inaugural EPT Online series took place on sponsor site PokerStars instead, running from 8–18 November 2020. The series comprised 20 tournaments, including a $5,200 Main Event, four $10,300 High Roller events, and a $25,000 Super High Roller. The Main Event, which had a $5 million guaranteed prize pool, attracted 1,304 entries. The final prize pool came to $6.52 million, of which $1,019,082 went to the eventual winner &quot;WhatIfGod&quot;, with Timothy Adams finishing as runner-up.

<doc id="1296515" wikidata="Q4792383" url="?curid=1296515" title="Arlington Park">
<text>Arlington Park (formerly known as Arlington International Racecourse) is a former horse race track in the Chicago suburbs of Arlington Heights, Illinois. Once called the &quot;Arlington Park Jockey Club&quot;, it was located adjacent to the Illinois Route 53 expressway and serviced by the Chicago and North Western Railway.

On February 15, 2023, the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) completed their purchase of the Arlington Park property. It has been reported that the team may build a stadium on the site for its home games.

==Overview==
Horse racing in the Chicago region had been a popular sport since the early days of the city in the 1830s, and at one time Chicago had more horse racing tracks (six) than any other major metropolitan area.

Arlington International was the site of the first thoroughbred race with a million-dollar purse in 1981. The premier event at Arlington Park was the International Festival of Racing, held in early August, which featured three Grade 1 races on turf: the Arlington Million Stakes, Beverly D. Stakes and Secretariat Stakes.

Owner Churchill Downs Inc. announced plans in February 2021 to sell all 326 acres of Arlington Park property for redevelopment. On September 29, 2021, the Chicago Bears announced that they reached an agreement to purchase the property; the sale was finalized in February 2023.

==History==
Arlington International Racecourse was founded as Arlington Park by California businessman Harry D. &quot;Curly&quot; Brown who would later serve as president of Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba. The track officially opened in 1927 to 20,000 spectators. Jockey Joe Bollero, who later became a successful trainer, rode Luxembourg to victory in the first race ever run at Arlington.

Benjamin F. Lindheimer acquired control of Arlington Park in 1940 and owned it until his death in 1960. Long involved with the business, adopted daughter Marje Lindheimer Everett then took over management of the racetrack.

Widely respected Hall of Fame trainer Jimmy Jones of Calumet Farms was quoted by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as saying that Lindheimer &quot;was the savior of Chicago racing&quot; and that &quot;Arlington Park became the finest track in the world—certainly the finest I&#x27;ve ever been on.&quot;

On July 5, 1948, Citation won the Stars and Stripes Stakes in his first appearance since winning the Triple Crown, equaling the record of the time by winning in 1:49 1/5. On June 24, 1952, jockey Eddie Arcaro becomes the first American jockey to win 3,000 races.

Five years after the seating capacity increased to 30,000 and parking facilities expanded to accommodate 15,000, a new paddock was unveiled in 1960. In 1964, Arlington Park inherits the thoroughbred race dates of Washington Park, who is now exclusively running harness races.

In 1966, future Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. got his first American victory. Two years later, the future Hall of Famer Dr. Fager wins the one-mile Washington Park Handicap in world record time of 1:32 1/5 - he carried 134 pounds and held that record until 1998.

In 1968, Marje Everett sold the racetrack to Gulf &amp; Western, remaining as director. The following year, she was accused of bribing Illinois Governor Otto Kerner Jr. The alleged bribes were in the form of stock options in 1961 that Kerner bought at a reduced price and then sold in 1968 at a profit. Kerner was eventually convicted of mail fraud, but Everett denied at trial that she intended to bribe him, and the government never identified her as a briber.

In June 1973, Arlington organized a race for three-year-olds, the Arlington Invitational, to lure Secretariat to the mid-west. Secretariat won easily and Arlington created the Secretariat Stakes, also for three-year-olds but on the turf, in his honor.

In 1981 under the direction of track president Joseph Joyce Jr., Arlington was the home of the world&#x27;s first million-dollar thoroughbred race: The Arlington Million. The result of that race is noted in bronze at the top of the paddock at Arlington, where a statue of jockey Bill Shoemaker riding John Henry to a come-from-behind victory over 40–1 longshot The Bart celebrates Thoroughbred racing&#x27;s inaugural million-dollar race.

Arlington entered a new era in 1983 when Richard L. Duchossois led an Illinois investment group consisting of himself, Joyce, Sheldon Robbins, and Ralph Ross, to purchase the track from its former owners and made a pledge to continue presenting championship racing; that was tested on July 31, 1985, when a small fire spread quickly out of control and completely destroyed the grandstand and clubhouse. Unsure of the future of Arlington, the meet was moved to Hawthorne Race Course - yet it was announced that the Arlington Million would still be held at Arlington International.

On August 25, 1985, they did just that by bulldozing and paving over the remains of the grandstand, and setting up temporary bleachers. Arlington Park won a Special Eclipse Award for making the &quot;Miracle Million&quot; happen.

Three years after Joyce resigned over disagreements with Duchossois, the track was fully reopened as a new name, Arlington International Racecourse in 1989.

In 1996, 34,000 fans jammed into Arlington to see the two-time Horse of the Year and future Hall of Famer Cigar tie the modern day record of 16 consecutive wins in the Arlington Citation Challenge.

In 2000, reopening after a two-year shutdown caused by contractual disputes preventing racing, Arlington was purchased in September by Churchill Downs Inc. Known as Arlington Park at the time, it hosted hosted the 2002 Breeders&#x27; Cup World Thoroughbred Championships at their track.

In 2007 to promote safer racing, Arlington International Racecourse invested $11 million to install a synthetic racing surface called Polytrack which is still used today. Do the Wave won the first race on the Polytrack on May 4. On May 11, Arlington debuts an alternate finish line at the 1/16 pole.

Known as Arlington Park for twelve years, it was renamed Arlington International Racecourse in 2013. In 2016, Arlington debuted the Arlington Racing Club, an ownership group with the goal to garner interest in thoroughbred ownership.

=== Reality television ===
On May 14, 2010, Lee DeWyze, a citizen of Mount Prospect, Illinois, and a contestant on &quot;American Idol&quot;, performed a concert at Arlington Park for approximately 41,000 fans. Also on May 14, Arlington is featured in an episode of &quot;Undercover Boss&quot; where Churchill Downs Inc. CEO Bill Carstanjen goes to Arlington and Calder Race Course.

A year later, on May 14, 2011, Haley Reinhart, of Wheeling, Illinois, also made the top 3 on &quot;American Idol&quot;. She, like DeWyze, had a hometown concert at the track for nearly 30,000 of her own fans and supporters.

=== Pioneers in racing ===

Arlington was the first track to install a public-address system and employed the pioneering race caller Clem McCarthy to describe the action. It added the first electric totalizator which allowed a credible tote board and decreased time between races, in 1933. In 1936 it added a photo finish camera. It introduced the first electric starting gate in 1940 and the largest closed-circuit TV system in all of sports in 1967. In 1971, Arlington held the industry&#x27;s first commercially sponsored race—the $100,000 Pontiac Grand Prix. On July 4, 1976, Arlington hosted the first races on a Sunday in Illinois. Arlington held the first Million Dollar horse race ever, the Arlington Million in 1981.

While Arlington is credited in some circles with the introduction of trifecta wagering in 1971, the New York Racing Association first offered the bet a year earlier as &quot;The Triple&quot;.

=== Racetrack Closure ===
In August 2019, track owner Churchill Downs Inc. (CDI) announced that it would consider options to transfer racing away from Arlington Park after 2021. The announcement stemmed from the enactment of the Illinois Gaming Act, which provided for the legalization of sports betting and the construction of new casinos in Illinois. The law gave CDI the right to install up to 1,200 gaming positions, such as slot machines, at Arlington Park. However, CDI – which had acquired a majority stake of Rivers Casino in nearby Des Plaines earlier that year and had already announced plans to expand it – argued that the installation of gaming positions at Arlington would result in higher tax payments of up to 20% compared to nearby casinos because of contributions needed to fund horse racing purses.

In February 2021, CDI announced plans to sell the entire Arlington Park property for redevelopment. CDI said it would also seek the transfer of Arlington&#x27;s racing license to another track in the state, but committed to Arlington&#x27;s race dates for 2021 (April 30 – September 25). In response, the Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen&#x27;s Association (which represents thoroughbred owners and trainers at both Arlington and Hawthorne) denounced CDI&#x27;s decision, alleging that CDI &quot;all but abandoned any meaningful commitment to Illinois racing&quot; after their majority acquisition of Rivers Casino.

===Chicago Bears Ownership===
In June 2021, the Chicago Bears announced they had submitted a bid to purchase the land for a potential new stadium to replace their longtime home of Soldier Field (where they have played since 1971). Later in June 2021, the Village of Arlington Heights formally approved overlay zoning district for a large-scale football stadium at the site.

The last race was held on September 25, 2021, with a 9-race event. The winner of the final race held at Arlington (which was named &quot;The Luxembourg&quot; after the winner of the first race at the track), was Sister Ruler. The final day was capped off with a showing of a documentary on the fire at the track and a fireworks show.

On September 29, 2021, the Bears announced they would purchase the property for $197.2 million. If a stadium is approved and built, it would be the second horse racing course to be replaced with an NFL venue in recent years, as Inglewood, California&#x27;s Hollywood Park (once owned by CDI) was replaced by SoFi Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams.

On October 27, 2021, the Chicago Bears confirmed that they are not pursuing horse racing but had no further details on their plans for the property. On March 16, 2022, the American football team announced that it have selected MANICA Architecture to help plan the new NFL stadium.

The Bears completed the purchase in February 2023. On May 30, 2023, it started demolition of the interior of the main grandstand, offices, and jockey facilities in preparation for their new stadium. Demolition of the grandstand was completed on September 26, 2023.

On March 11, 2024, Chicago Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren announced that the team had decided to commit $2 billion to build a new stadium in Chicago, leaving the future of the Arlington Park property uncertain. The Bears had run into issues concerning the value of the Arlington Park land, which had been contested by the local school districts in Arlington Heights.

==Physical attributes==

The track had a one-mile and one-eighth dirt oval and a one-mile turf oval. There was stabling on the backstretch for over 2,000 horses.

Arlington replaced its dirt course with a synthetic track prior to the opening of the 2007 season.

<text>Secretum (De secreto conflictu curarum mearum, translated as The Secret or My Secret Book) is a trilogy of dialogues in Latin written by Petrarch sometime from 1342 to 1353, in which he examines his faith with the help of Saint Augustine, and &quot;in the presence of The Lady Truth&quot;. &quot;Secretum&quot; was not circulated until some time after Petrarch&#x27;s death, and was probably meant to be a means of self-examination during &quot;the crisis of his middle years&quot; more than a work to be published and read by others.

The dialogue opens with Augustine chastising Petrarch for ignoring his own mortality and his fate in the afterlife by not devoting himself fully to God. Petrarch concedes that this lack of piety is the source of his unhappiness, but he insists that he cannot overcome it. The dialogue then turns to the question of Petrarch&#x27;s seeming lack of free will, and Augustine explains that it is his love for temporal things (specifically Laura), and his pursuit of fame through poetry that &quot;bind his will in adamantine chains&quot;.

Petrarch&#x27;s turn towards religion in his later life was inspired in part by Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;, and Petrarch imitates Augustine&#x27;s style of self-examination and harsh self-criticism in &quot;Secretum&quot;. The ideas expressed in the dialogues are taken mostly from Augustine, particularly the importance of free will in achieving faith. Other notable influences include Cicero and other Pre-Christian thinkers.

&quot;Secretum&quot; can be seen as an attempt by Petrarch to reconcile his Renaissance humanism and admiration of the classical world with his Christian faith. Especially important are his rejection of love for temporal things not because it is a sin, but because it prevents him from knowing the eternal, a position that resembles classical philosophy far more than the contemporary Christian theology. Classical writers are also regarded as sources of authority supporting Christianity, and &quot;Secretum&quot; quotes them more frequently than scripture.

<text>Nicollet Park ( ) was a baseball ground located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The venue was home to the minor league Minneapolis Millers of the Western League and later American Association from 1896 to 1955.

The ballpark opened on June 20, 1896, with a 13–6 win over Milwaukee. The new grounds were first known as Wright Field, named for one of baseball&#x27;s founding fathers, Harry Wright. Area newspapers had held a contest and chose that name over &quot;Nicollet Park&quot; among others, awarding season tickets to the winning entrants.[Minneapolis Star-Tribune, June 17, 1896, p. 5] The papers acknowledged the built-in pun on &quot;right field&quot;, and added to it by describing one hit in the opener as a home run &quot;knocked by the right-fielder, across right field, out of Wright Field.&quot;

The club owners were not enamored of the name, and it was soon renamed &quot;Nicollet Park&quot;, the name &quot;Nicollet&quot; being ubiquitous in Minneapolis then and now.

The wooden ballpark was replaced by a steel and concrete structure in 1912. Lights were installed in 1937. The first night game was played on July 16, with the Millers hosting the arch-rival St. Paul Saints. The teams had also played the previous night, in Lexington Park&#x27;s first night game.

The ballpark was on a small block bounded by Nicollet Avenue on the east, 31st Street on the south, Blaisdell Avenue on the west and Lake Street (or 30th Street) on the north in the present-day Lyndale neighborhood. Home plate was in the southwest corner. A small ticket office building with a Spanish-style roof stood outside the right field corner, at the Nicollet-31st intersection.

Because of its location, the field dimensions at Nicollet Park favored left-handed batters. The park was considered a &quot;homer haven&quot; because of its official distance down the right-field line, listed as 279 feet. In fact, the distance was actually closer to 260 feet, but this never made it out of the local press. In 1955, the Millers had a team with particular home run prowess, setting the league record by decimating their own franchise record of 217 by smashing 241 home runs. The Millers collected 163 (nearly 68%) of those four-baggers at Nicollet Park. With the all-time league home run record in tow, the Millers went on to become the American Association champions that year.

Joe Hauser hit 69 homers for the Millers in 1933. Ted Williams also made a bit of a splash here in 1938, on his way up to the major leagues, registering 43 round-trippers to lead the league. Willie Mays was enjoyed by the Minneapolis fans for only a month or so in 1951 before the parent club New York Giants brought the young ballplayer to the big leagues.

Nicollet Park, which had opened with a big win 60 years earlier, went out with a bang on September 28, 1955, as the Millers won the American Association championship tournament, and then went on to vie for the Junior World Series championship, facing the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. The series went the distance of seven games, and the finale on September 28 was a close-fought win for the Millers in what was also the final game at Nicollet Park. In 1956 the Millers moved to Metropolitan Stadium in the suburb of Bloomington.

The park also held early National Football League games as the Minneapolis Marines and Minneapolis Red Jackets played home games there during the 1920s. In 1944 the Minneapolis Millerettes of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League called Nicollet Park home. Nicollet Park was also the place that the cereal Wheaties was first advertised. Augsburg University&#x27;s football team played their home games at Nicollet from 1946 to 1950. The New York Giants and Green Bay Packers played a preseason game on August 29, 1948, at Nicollet Park.

In 1955, the ballpark closed. Currently, a condominium building with a Hennepin County Medical Center clinic is located on the north portion of the former baseball park&#x27;s site, bordered by Lake Street. Until 2020, the south section of the site included a Wells Fargo Bank branch, built originally as a major branch for Norwest Bank, and an external drive-up building positioned near what was once the center field corner. On the night of May 29, 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the bank and nearby drive-up building were looted and set on fire. As of 2021, the remains of these buildings have since been demolished and plans are underway to rebuild the bank, along with an apartment complex containing at least 200 units of affordable housing. There was a plaque detailing the ballpark&#x27;s history, though with the bank&#x27;s demolition, it has been removed.

<text>Louie Lee Wainwright (September 11, 1923 – December 23, 2021) was an American corrections administrator who served as Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections from 1962 to 1987. He is known for having been the named respondent in two U.S. Supreme Court cases: &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; in which indigents are guaranteed an attorney, and &quot;Ford v. Wainwright&quot;, in which the Court approved the common law rule prohibiting the execution of the insane. Time Magazine called the &quot;Gideon&quot; decision one of the ten most important legal events of the 1960s. He also appeared as the respondent in a number of habeas corpus petitions that reached the Supreme Court level during his tenure in office, making &quot;Wainwright&quot; one of the most familiar names to students of habeas corpus law.

==Biography==

Born in Lawtey, Florida, Wainwright received a master&#x27;s degree in criminal justice from Nova Southeastern University, later serving as a temporary faculty member there. He was then acknowledged as dean of American Correctional Administrators. Wainwright was appointed secretary of the Florida Division of Corrections by Cecil Farris Bryant (Florida Governor at that time) in 1962, replacing H. G. Cochran and remained in the position until 1987, when Richard L. Dugger assumed the role.

Wainwright served under six governors: C. Farris Bryant, Haydon Burns, Claude Roy Kirk, Jr., Reubin Askew, Bob Graham, and Wayne Mixson.

He received the American Correctional Association&#x27;s highest tribute, the E.R. Cass Award, for outstanding service, and his efforts in support of accreditation in Florida and nationwide earned him the 1986 Accreditation Achievement Award from the Commission of Accreditation for Corrections. Wainwright was appointed to the Corrections Foundation Board in 2001 and re-appointed president in 2003 and annually through 2016.

He also served as president of the Florida Peace Officers&#x27; Association from 1965 to 1966, where he was still a prominent and respected member. He was once the superintendent of Avon Park Correctional Institution. His post, Secretary of the Florida Division of Corrections, replaced the post of Director of the Division of Corrections.

Wainwright died in Tallahassee, Florida, on December 23, 2021, at the age of 98.

<text>Lieutenant Commander William George Boaks (25 May 1904 – 4 April 1986) was a British Royal Navy officer who became a political campaigner for road safety. A pioneer of British eccentric political campaigning, he jointly held the record for the fewest votes recorded for a candidate in a British parliamentary election, taking five at a by-election in 1982.

==Early life==
Boaks was born in Walthamstow, into a naval family. His father, William, was a sales clerk for a fruit merchant. He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.

Boaks entered the Royal Navy in 1920, aged 16, as a boy seaman, and was promoted from acting sub-lieutenant to sub-lieutenant on 1 December 1928. He was granted a temporary commission as a flying officer while on attachment to the Royal Air Force between 2 October 1930 and 7 May 1931, and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 December 1931, and to lieutenant commander on 1 December 1939.

Boaks was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his part in the Dunkirk evacuation in May 1940, during which his ship was sunk, and also took part in the sinking of the while serving as a gunnery officer on board in May 1941.

He served in the Navy for nearly thirty years, becoming a qualified submarine officer and deep-sea diver. He was amongst the first Allied officers at Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Boaks retired from the Navy in May 1949. He moved to Streatham and worked as an executive officer of the Building Apprenticeship Training Council. Boaks applied for the vacant position of Chief Constable of Berkshire in 1958 but was not offered an interview.

==Political career==

=== Political campaigning ===

==== 1950s ====
Boaks&#x27; first candidacy for election was at the 1951 general election. Boaks contested Walthamstow East as an independent candidate for Admiral, or the &quot;Association of Democratic Monarchists Representing All Women&quot;. He had intended to stand against the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, but stood for the wrong seat (Attlee&#x27;s constituency was Walthamstow West). Boaks&#x27; campaign advocated equal pay for women, subsidised apprenticeships and the sale of council houses. Boaks received 174 votes, finishing in last place with 0.4% of the vote.

Following his candidacy at Walthamstow East, Boaks continued a career as an eccentric campaigner. To publicise his campaigns, Boaks initially used his Vauxhall 12 car, which he named Josephine and painted as a zebra crossing, complete with loudspeakers and placards. In later campaigns, owing to a lack of money, Boaks used a 140lb armoured bicycle which concealed an iron bedstead. The armoured bicycle included a camera for taking photographs of motorists breaking the law and featured an eight-foot flagpole with sloganeering banners. The bike was eventually hijacked and taken to Aberystwyth; Boaks was unable to afford the £20 to have it repaired. In September 1952, Boaks was fined twenty shillings at Bow Street Court for using a motor vehicle for advertising. He was fined a further twenty shillings a year later at Mansion House Magistrates Court on the same charge.

In 1953 he was a Liberal candidate for Streatham Hill ward in the Wandsworth Metropolitan Borough Council elections.

In the 1950s, Boaks became involved in a series of legal cases in which he launched private prosecutions of public figures who had been involved in road accidents. These included Lady Attlee, Prince Philip, Princess Anne and R.A. Butler. Boaks accused Butler, who was then Home Secretary, of being an accomplice to a policeman who drove Butler to the House of Commons and had committed six traffic offences in Parliament Square. In light of this, Boaks was not interviewed when he applied to be Chief Constable of Berkshire in 1958.

On 2 April 1955, before the start of an England-Scotland football match at Wembley Stadium, Boaks stopped his van outside and refused to move until all the spectators had crossed the road in front of it. Two hours later, he stopped his car at a roundabout on Cambridge Circus, again refusing to move until pedestrians crossed. He was subsequently convicted of two counts of obstructing the highway and fined £5. On 1 October 1955, Boaks stopped his car at the Strand, and was convicted again of obstructing the highway, and incarcerated for a week in Brixton Prison. Boaks sued for wrongful imprisonment and sought £10,000 in damages; his case was dismissed in June 1956, as was his appeal in November 1956, and the House of Lords refused his petition to hear his appeal.

Boaks stood again in the 1956 by-election in Walthamstow West, finishing in last place, with 89 votes.

On 13 July 1959, Boaks entered the Bleriot Race to travel from Marble Arch in London to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris by any form of transport. Boaks opted to enter the race by rollerskate.

==== 1960s ====
In February 1961, Boaks unsuccessfully applied for planning permission to build a heliport in his garden. Boaks subsequently submitted further applications to Lambeth London Borough Council, including a proposal to build an underground hangar for eight civil defence helicopters. Boaks hoped that people would give up their cars and travel by bus or helicopter instead. To this end he proposed that landing pads should be installed in every city.

In June 1963, Boaks attempted to prosecute Ernest Robert Wilkin for dangerous driving. Boaks had allowed two girls to cross the road at a green light, which had led Wilkin to run over one of them. The court dismissed the case and awarded Wilkin fifty guineas.

Boaks sued the &quot;South London Press&quot; for libel after it described him as &quot;nutty&quot; on 27 March 1962. He also sued the &quot;London Evening News&quot; for libel after it falsely claimed he was living on National Assistance on 18 March 1966. In the latter case, he won notional damages of £1, and later complained to the Court of Appeal that the judge had misdirected the jury; he lost the appeal.

Over the years, Boaks&#x27;s political label changed. In one election, he stood as the &quot;Trains &amp; Boats &amp; Planes&quot; candidate – the title of a contemporary popular song. After revisions to electoral law allowed candidates to have a six-word description of their candidature on the ballot paper, he eventually settled on &quot;Public Safety Democratic Monarchist White Resident&quot;.

He would campaign intermittently by cycling around the target constituency, wearing a large cardboard box daubed with his slogans. He was limited to six words of description on the ballot paper, and usually described himself as &quot;Air, Road, Public Safety, White Resident&quot; or &quot;Democratic Monarchist, Public Safety, White Resident&quot;.

Boaks stood for election to Lambeth London Borough Council in 1964, 1968 and 1971, standing for the ward of Town Hall in the first election and for that of Streatham Wells in the last two. He also stood in the by-election for the ward of St. Leonard&#x27;s on 27 June 1968. 

He stood for election to the Greater London Council in Lambeth in 1964 and 1970, at the Greenwich by-election in 1967, Lambeth Central in 1977 and Streatham in 1973 and 1981.

==== 1970s and 1980s ====
At some point in the early 1970s, a compulsory purchase order was issued on Boaks&#x27; home by Lambeth Council. Boaks moved to Kingston Road in Wimbledon Chase as a result.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Boaks&#x27;s political career moved from his motorised public campaigning and subsequent court cases to standing as an eccentric campaigner in parliamentary elections and by-elections. Boaks contested the Clapham constituency at the 1970 general election, receiving 80 votes. He had intended to contest the Liverpool Scotland by-election of 1971, but failed to place his £150 deposit on time. He stood for his home constituencies of Streatham and Wimbledon at the February 1974 general election; in the latter, he received 240 votes, which was his highest ever number of votes.

Boaks contested the ward of Wimbledon South for Merton London Borough Council in the 1974 local election. Boaks subsequently stood in all of the local by-elections for Merton London Borough Council between 1974 and 1978 as &quot;Air Road Public Safety White Resident&quot;. He also stood in the Merton Park ward by-election in 1980 as &quot;Public Safety, Democratic Monarchist, White Resident&quot;.

Boaks contested the 1976 by-election in Carshalton, which marked the beginning of 18 parliamentary by-elections he would contest in the 47th and 48th Parliaments of the United Kingdom. Boaks would visit a constituency to secure the ten names required to be nominated as a candidate, and would not campaign in the constituency.

At the Glasgow Hillhead by-election in March 1982, he received just five votes, a new record low for a candidate in any British parliamentary election. The feat was remarkable, given that it meant fewer people voted for him than gave their names for his nomination as a candidate. Boaks&#x27; record stood until the 2005 general election.

In November 1982, Boaks received head injuries in a road accident, dissuading him from further pursuing his electoral career. He nevertheless attended the count at the Bermondsey by-election as counting agent for Screaming Lord Sutch in 1983. But there was also the simple matter that his money was running out. Boaks had planned to be the Official Monster Raving Loony Party&#x27;s candidate for the 1983 general election, standing in Streatham; however, this plan never came to pass.

Boaks never received a vote share exceeding 0.5%, meaning that he lost all his £150 deposits. In all Boaks&#x27; political career, he lost over £4,200 in deposits.

=== Political views ===

==== Road safety ====
Boaks&#x27;s main concern was public safety on the roads. He was a major advocate of pedestrian and non-motor vehicle traffic rights, and a need for additional care in road safety. He advocated transporting freight by rail and using helicopters to alleviate traffic congestion. Under the guise of the British National Airways National Heliport Network and Central London Airport and Aerodrome Association, he proposed to close inland airports, including Heathrow Airport, and replace them with a series of coastal airports. He also noted and highlighted the problems caused by pollution and the damage caused to properties beside roads favoured by heavy goods vehicles. Boaks wanted the inversion of the law concerning zebra crossings, so that all roadways would be treated as if they were zebra crossings except those parts painted as such, thus giving pedestrians the right of way at all times.

To reinforce his point, Boaks would sometimes deliberately hold up traffic at crossings. He later took to pushing a trolley or pram full of bricks back and forth repeatedly at zebra crossings. He would sit in a deckchair in the overtaking lane of the Westway in North Kensington, reading &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

==== Anti-establishment ====
Boaks&#x27; political views tended towards an increasing distrust of the establishment, fuelled by his frequent court appearances. He was against Communism and homosexuality in the civil service. Journalists, some of whom seem to have been scared of him, often expressed confusion over his claims, as they never quite knew whether he was being serious or simply having fun at their expense. For example, when deciding not to fight the Croydon North West by-election in 1981, he said that he would never fight in Croydon as he believed that the &quot;Communist menace&quot; was never a threat there. He also said on at least one occasion that he believed that homosexuals should be debarred from the Civil Service, as he thought they were more vulnerable to blackmail by foreign powers.

==== Attitudes to race relations ====
Boaks&#x27;s &quot;White Resident&quot; label led to him being labelled as racist by the Anti-Nazi League, but Boaks chose this mostly as a means of provoking left-wingers, whom he disliked (despite having a number of rather left-wing views of his own, particularly on the Health Service), and partly as he hoped to undercut votes for the National Front (NF) and similar parties. Boaks was contemptuous of the NF, having stood against a number of its members in the 1950s and 1960s when they belonged to more openly neo-Nazi groups, such as John Bean&#x27;s British National Party, Colin Jordan&#x27;s White Defence League and Oswald Mosley&#x27;s Union Movement. The &quot;White Resident&quot; tag was also a means of more easily attracting media attention during the heated debate over immigration in the 1970s in the UK, in order to push his &quot;Public Safety&quot; agenda.

Boaks&#x27;s stance led to his becoming the first promoter of ethnic minority candidates in United Kingdom elections. His usual set-piece response when confronted over his label by anyone non-white was to say: &quot;Why &#x27;White Resident&#x27;? Because that&#x27;s what I am!&quot; He would then grab the questioner&#x27;s hand, slap a pound note into it and say: &quot;Now find 149 more of those [the deposit then being £150] and stand as a &#x27;Black Immigrant&#x27; candidate for what YOU believe in. If you don&#x27;t, who will?&quot; Boaks reckoned that he had given away a couple of hundred pounds in this manner.

=== Summary of parliamentary election results ===
==Personal life==
Boaks married Ivy June Colier in 1930, with whom he had three children.

==Death and legacy==
In 1984, Boaks was injured in a second minor road traffic incident while getting off a bus. Following the incident, he rarely left his home, except for twice-weekly visits to the hospital. As a result of complications from the head injuries he sustained, he died of pneumonia and heart failure at St George&#x27;s Hospital in Tooting on 4 April 1986.

Boaks&#x27; funeral was attended by the Minister of Transport, Peter Bottomley. He was buried at sea with full honours in the naval graveyard outside Portsmouth Harbour.

Boaks&#x27;s legacies include:
* Pedestrianisation of London&#x27;s Carnaby Street, which he took an active part in campaigning for, along with Screaming Lord Sutch, and which has set the precedent for pedestrian precincts elsewhere in the UK.
* , which is moored near Tower Bridge in London as a tourist attraction. It was Boaks&#x27; advice as to the depths of the waters of the Thames that persuaded the Royal Navy of the ship&#x27;s viability as a floating museum rather than scrapping her.

<text> () is a pasta dish typically prepared with fresh tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, basil, and salt. It is intended to be a quick and light dish, rather than a dish in a heavy sauce.

==Etymology==
 means &#x27;tomato&#x27; in Italian. More specifically, is a univerbation of (&#x27;apple&#x27;) + (&#x27;of&#x27;) + (&#x27;gold&#x27;), possibly owing to the fact that the first varieties of tomatoes arriving in Europe and spreading from Spain to Italy and North Africa were yellow, with the earliest attestation (of the archaic plural form ) going back to Pietro Andrea Mattioli (1544).

A red strain was later developed in Africa, which came to be known in Italy as (&#x27;apple of the Moors&#x27;).

<text>The Illinois Medical District (IMD) is a special-use zoning district two miles west of the Loop in Chicago, Illinois. The Illinois Medical District consists of 560 acres of medical research facilities, labs, a biotechnology business incubator, a raw development area, four major hospitals, two medical universities, and more than 40 health care related facilities. The IMD has more than 29,000 employees, 50,000 daily visitors and generates $3.4 billion in economic opportunity. The Illinois Medical District is the largest medical district in North America, and has the most diverse patient population on the continent.

Four major hospitals anchor the IMD, including the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center; Rush University Medical Center; The John H. Stroger, Jr., Hospital of Cook County; and The University of Illinois Hospital &amp; Health Sciences System.

Governed by seven appointed commissioners, the district is focused on expanding innovation in healthcare, medical science, information technology, biotechnology, medical devices, clean technology and supportive assisted living. In 2013, the IMD conducted a strategic plan in which four key priorities were identified so that the IMD could remain a leader in patient care and medical research while utilizing its diversity and assets to further drive economic growth. These four areas are what the IMD uses to filter new projects and plans: Infrastructure &amp; Development, Community Health, Translational Research and Clinical Data.

Member institutions include:

*Chicago Children&#x27;s Advocacy Center
*Chicago Lighthouse
*Easter Seals of Metropolitan Chicago
*FBI
*Furnetic
*Hektoen Institute
*Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary
*Illinois State Police Forensic Science Center
*IMD Guest House Foundation
*Jesse Brown VA Medical Center
*John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County (Cook County Hospital)
*Rush University Medical Center
*Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center
*University of Illinois Medical Center

== West Side Grounds and the Chicago Cubs ==

A block within the Illinois Medical District bounded by Taylor, Wood, Polk and Lincoln (now Wolcott) Streets was home to the Chicago Cubs baseball club from 1893 to 1915, at the 16,000 capacity West Side Park. The first game was held on May 14, 1893 (Cincinnati 13, Chicago 12) and the last game was on October 3, 1915 (Chicago 7, St. Louis 2). On October 9, 1906, the ballpark hosted the first intra-urban World Series Game between the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox.

<text>The Harvard Division of Continuing Education is a division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. It is responsible for four major programs in continuing education:

# Harvard Extension School (Founded 1910)
# Harvard Summer School (Founded 1871)
# Harvard Professional &amp; Executive Development(Founded 2011)
# Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement (Founded 1977)

==Programs==

Harvard Extension School, founded in 1910, offers online and on-campus education for nontraditional students through open-enrollment for individual courses, part-time day and evening classes, and opportunities for personal enrichment or career advancement, including offering undergraduate certificates and graduate certificates. For students that are accepted through a formal admissions process, the school also offers the degrees of Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALB) and Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies (ALM).

Harvard Professional &amp; Executive Development was established in 2011 to provide working professionals with short, noncredit programs. The offerings were designed for those who wanted to build job skills in just a few days, with the educational content of a conference but the small-group environment of a traditional course. Harvard PDP features more than 120 programs across six topic areas, including leadership, business, innovation, marketing, negotiation, and communication. In the broader lifelong-learning mission of DCE, Harvard PDP serves tactical, skills-based teaching for those looking to complement their education or professional experience in a short timeframe.

Harvard Summer School, founded in 1871, is the first academic summer session established in the United States. Each summer, more than 5,000 students of all ages come to Harvard from across the United States and more than 100 foreign countries to study for seven weeks with faculty from Harvard and other universities. The Summer School offers approximately 300 daytime and evening classes in more than forty disciplines.

Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement, created in 1977, offers retirees and other older adults an opportunity to explore new areas of knowledge in peer-taught study groups. Each year, approximately 500 people ranging in age from their fifties to their nineties participate in the Institute&#x27;s programs.

==Organization and faculty==
The &quot;Dean of Continuing Education and University Extension&quot; leads the Division. He or she is appointed by and reports to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Dean of the Harvard Summer School reports to the Dean of Continuing Education. The Summer School and the Extension School draw their instructors from Harvard University, other institutions of higher learning, and the private sector.

<doc id="1296552" wikidata="Q433726" url="?curid=1296552" title="Michael Angelo Batio">
<text>Michael Angelo Batio ( ; born June 12, 1956), also known as Michael Angelo, Mike Batio or MAB, is an American heavy metal guitarist. He was the lead guitarist for the glam metal band Nitro in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He is currently the permanent guitarist for the band Manowar.

He is best known for playing heavy metal and its subgenres such as neoclassical metal and speed metal.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Batio was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, to an Italian father and a German mother. He started playing the piano and composing music at the age of five, and first played guitar at the age of ten. By twelve he was playing in bands in youth clubs, churches, and shows, playing for 10–12 hours on the weekends. He started listening to and watching professionals and sitting down and trying to work out riffs and tunes.

He attended Northeastern Illinois University and achieved a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music Theory and Composition. After he had graduated, Batio looked to become a session guitarist in his hometown. When he asked for a job at a nearby studio, he was given a piece of music and simply asked to play it. He managed to play it adding his own improvisations and fills, making him the studio&#x27;s primary call-out guitarist.

===Holland, the Michael Angelo Band and Nitro (1984–1993)===
Batio began his recording career in 1984 when he joined new Chicago-based heavy metal band Holland, an eponymous project set up by ex-Steppenwolf singer Tommy Holland. With major label Atlantic Records, the band released their debut studio album in 1985 entitled &quot;Little Monsters&quot;, which saw moderate success in the United States. The band split up soon after, and a compilation of material from the &quot;Little Monsters&quot; sessions, &quot;Wake Up the Neighborhood&quot;, was released in 1999 through Batio&#x27;s label M.A.C.E. Music.

In 1987, after the breakup of Holland, Batio joined glam metal artist Jim Gillette on his solo album &quot;Proud to Be Loud&quot;, before founding the band Nitro with bassist T.J. Racer and drummer Bobby Rock. In 1989 Nitro released their first studio album, &quot;O.F.R.&quot;, from which they released two singles, &quot;Freight Train&quot; and &quot;Long Way From Home&quot;. The music video for &quot;Freight Train&quot;, which received much airplay on MTV, was notable for featuring Batio playing his now famous &#x27;Quad Guitar&#x27;, a notion which &quot;FHM magazine&quot; voted one of the &quot;50 most outrageous moments in rock history&quot;.

===Solo career (1993–present)===
In April 1993, Batio founded his own record label, M.A.C.E. Music, which became one of the first labels online in 1996. He used this label when he began recording his first album, &quot;No Boundaries&quot;, which he released in 1995. Batio&#x27;s second studio release was &quot;Planet Gemini&quot; in 1997, which showed a very progressive, experimental side to his playing. In 1999, Batio released his second instructional video, &quot;Jam With Angelo&quot;, which came with his third studio album as a companion CD: &quot;Tradition&quot;. This was quickly followed by a fourth full-length album in 2000, &quot;Lucid Intervals and Moments of Clarity&quot;, which was credited to &quot;Mike Batio and Rob Ross&quot;, the latter being the drummer.

In 2001, Batio released a CD with his band &quot;C4,&quot; covering songs from his Holland years and including the original &quot;Call to Arms.&quot; It was his 1st all vocal CD since recording with Nitro. Batio and C4 were featured on &quot;Rock My Ass&quot;, a TV show self-described as &quot;Chicago&#x27;s live music venue from your couch&quot;. This was not Batio&#x27;s first appearance on the show, having also appeared in 1999 with a band called No Remorse.

In 2004, Batio released a compilation album, &quot;Lucid Intervals and Moments of Clarity Part 2.&quot;

In 2005, Batio released &quot;Hands Without Shadows&quot;, which featured guest appearances from such musicians as Mark Tremonti, Rudy Sarzo and Bill Peck.

On September 2, 2022, Manowar announced that Batio will join the band for their 2023 world tour.

===Film appearance===
In 1991, Batio&#x27;s guitar work appeared in the low budget horror film &quot;Shock &#x27;Em Dead.&quot;

==Style==
Batio was voted the &quot;No. 1 Fastest Guitar Shredder of All Time&quot; by &quot;Guitar One Magazine&quot; in 2003.

He is ambidextrous.

==Equipment==

===Guitars===

Batio has an extensive collection of around 170 guitars, which he has accumulated since the 1980s. Among his instruments are a Dave Bunker &quot;Touch guitar&quot; (double neck with both bass and guitar, similar to the Chapman Stick), a mint-condition 1968 Fender Mustang, a 1986 Fender Stratocaster 1962 re-issue and several other vintage and custom-built guitars. Among his custom-made guitars is a 29-fret guitar made of military-grade aluminum, which makes the guitar very light. For live performances Batio is an exclusive user of Dean Guitars, both electric and acoustic. In 2007 he designed and developed a signature guitar with Dean, known as the MAB1 Armor Flame.

Earlier in his career when he was first endorsed by Dean guitars he also embraced Dean&#x27;s tradition of popularizing Dimarzio pickups and had used Dimarzios in his guitars. These include the Dimarzio PAF, Super Distortion (sometimes using the Super Distortion both in the neck and bridge position, as he did in his Gibson Charvel Circuit Board double guitar. This was the main setup during the recording of No Boundaries). Batio has also used pickups of other brands including Seymour Duncan, namely the Pearly Gates and JB models and also Bill Lawrence pickups. Currently other than using EMGs in his signature guitar he also has a collection of the other brand pickups in his Dean limited edition collectors&#x27; models, such as Dimarzio Custom Super Distortions (based on the Super 2 and Super Distortion) in his USA Dean Time capsule Blue Burst ML and the Seymour Duncan pair he used (refer to above) in his USA Dean Collectors edition Hardtail.

====Double Guitar====

Batio plays a Double Guitar, a V-shaped, twin-neck guitar which can be played both right- and left-handed. The first version of this instrument was actually two separate guitars simply played together, as opposed to being one entity. A Flying V was fastened to a snare drum in a left-handed position, while another one was strapped around his shoulder. The next version of the guitar, as designed by Batio and guitar technician Kenny Breit, featured a flight case latch attached to the back of each guitar, which could reportedly be assembled in five seconds. By far his most famous and definitely his most photographed double guitar is his USA Dean Mach 7 Jet Double Guitar along with its custom Anvil flight case. One of his inspirations for the radical design was jazz saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, who was known for playing two or three instruments simultaneously. Batio saw Kirk in concert during his teens, and said the jazz musician &quot;blew his mind.&quot;

When the Double Guitar was first used in concert, Batio noticed that the guitars created a lot of feedback when played together. He decided that he needed to invent a way to dampen the strings when both guitars were played at the same time, hence the invention of the &quot;MAB String Dampener&quot;, which is now available to buy from M.A.C.E. Music.

The Double Guitar was named as the 8th &quot;coolest guitar in rock&quot; by online music magazine &quot;Gigwise&quot;.

====Quad Guitar====
As well as the Double Guitar, Michael Angelo also invented and designed the Quad Guitar. The guitar was originally built in conjunction with Gibson, and built by Wayne Charvel in California. The top two guitars have seven strings, while the bottom two have the regular six. The first Quad, as used in the video for Nitro&#x27;s &quot;Freight Train&quot;, was stolen in El Paso, Texas, after the second show of Nitro&#x27;s &quot;O.F.R.&quot; tour. When Batio was performing in November 2004, a young fan named Simon Jones and his father turned up with a guitar case which held inside the two top guitars of the Quad, as found by Mick Seymour. Dean designed and had Mike Lipe build a new Quad Guitar in 2008.

The Quad Guitar was recently named as the second-&quot;coolest guitar in rock&quot; by online music magazine &quot;Gigwise&quot;.

Some of the mentioned guitars appears on Rob Scallon&#x27;s video with Michael Angelo Batio on his Youtube Channel.

<doc id="1296556" wikidata="Q2704561" url="?curid=1296556" title="Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu">
<text>is a spin-off season of &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; by Gonzo. The series takes place between the first and the second season.

Markedly different in tone to the first series, &quot;Fumoffu&quot; emphasizes the high school romantic comedy aspects of &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; with often crude humor and focuses on the romantic tension between Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori. It frequently parodies itself and anime stereotypes. None of the mecha combat or political intrigue, which characterized much of the original &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot;, can be seen in the series. The only reference to the mecha aspect of &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; is the Bonta-kun, which is one of the most prominent parodies in the anime.

&quot;Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu&quot; was directed by Yasuhiro Takemoto and produced by Kyoto Animation, which replaced Gonzo as the series producer and became the first anime television show from this studio. The English version was produced by ADV Films. The original broadcast in Japan aired from August 25 to November 18, 2003. 12 half-hour episodes were created, but only 11 were broadcast on Japanese television. The missing episode was not broadcast because its plot dealt with kidnapping and was similar to a series of kidnappings that happened in real-life Japan shortly before the planned broadcast. However, the missing stories are featured on all DVD and Blu-ray releases. To coincide with seasonal change, the last three episodes feature character animations in an autumn setting, as opposed to a summer setting in the rest of the series. At Anime USA 2009, Funimation Entertainment announced that it acquired the rights to the first and second series. DVD and Blu-ray sets were re-released on October 5, 2010 and the series made its North American television debut on November 15, 2010, on the Funimation Channel.

The fictional Jindai (陣代) High School, which Kaname and Sousuke are students of, is based on the real life Jindai (神代) High School in Chōfu, Tokyo.

==Plot==

In contrast to the original series, there is little plot continuity between episodes and most of them can stand alone, needing very little recap, if any. The only break from this pattern is a handful of two-part stories which are told over two episodes. Most of the stories in &quot;Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu&quot; are adaptations of plots from the original &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; short stories written by Shoji Gatoh and published in the &quot;Dragon Magazine.&quot;

The creators of &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; planned to give the new series title &quot;Full Metal Panic?&quot; - with the exclamation mark exchanged for a question mark. However, they quickly realized that such a minor alternation was insufficient to properly differentiate between the new series and the original. For that reason, it was decided that the fictional word &quot;Fumoffu&quot; would be used.

&quot;Fumoffu&quot; is the sound made by Bonta-kun, the series&#x27; fictional mascot, which resembles a human-sized, yellow teddy bear, seemingly parodying Gonta-kun from the educational show &quot;Dekirukana&quot;. It is a personal armor suit, designed by Sousuke for the purpose of providing aid in tactical situations. Even though only capable of moving with human running speed and limited by its size, the suit is essentially a miniature Arm Slave. However, due to the suit&#x27;s main computer&#x27;s malfunction, all syllables uttered by the pilot are changed to either &quot;Fu&quot;, &quot;Mo&quot;, &quot;Ffu&quot;, or &quot;Ru&quot;. The suit&#x27;s operating system immediately crashes if the pilot tries to deactivate the &quot;voice changer&quot;. For that reason, Kaname has to translate what Sousuke wants to say using a headset radio, which is a frequent cause of humor in the series.

==Media==
===Anime===

The first DVD of the series was released in Japan on November 27, 2003. The initial release consisted of 4 discs and was slightly different for Region 2 (Europe and Japan) and Region 1 (North America). Since then, the DVDs were repackaged several times and a number of subsequent releases exist to date. In addition, the series was released on Blu-ray in 2008 in Japan. However, it did not feature English subtitles and after enabling English audio, Japanese subtitles were forced on the screen. The US distribution rights for the series were bought by Funimation in late 2009. DVD and Blu-ray sets were re-released on October 5, 2010.

===Soundtrack===

Music for the series was composed by Toshihiko Sahashi, while opening and closing songs were performed by Mikuni Shimokawa. Complete soundtrack, which features full versions of both songs along with instrumental themes, was released by Pony Canyon Records on a single CD in 2003.

==Reception==
Bryce Coulter of Mania gave the series a B+ rating. He noted the series could be watched by those unfamiliar with the main series as almost no references were made that required watching the first season.

===Comparison===
The season vastly contrasts with the rest of the series. Coulter opines that the first season is known for its fierce battles while &quot;Fumoffu&quot; is noted for merriment and comedy stating, &quot;It seems to be more akin to a comedy spin-off of loosely gathered slap-stick side stories that the author couldn&#x27;t find a place for in &quot;FMP.&quot; The true embodiment and symbol of this series is a cuddly bear costume gone Rambo. &quot;Fumoffu!&quot;&quot;

<text>Johann Nikolaus Götz (July 9, 1721 – November 4, 1781) was a German poet from Worms.

==Biography==
Götz was born in Worms. He studied theology at Halle (1739–1742), where he became intimate with the poets Johann W. L. Gleim and Johann Peter Uz, acted for some years as military chaplain, and afterwards filled various other ecclesiastical offices. He died in Winterburg, near Bad Kreuznach.

==Works==

The writings of Götz consist of a number of short lyrics and several translations, of which a rendering of Anacreon is notable. His original compositions are light, lively and sparkling, and are animated rather by French wit than by German depth of sentiment. The best known of his poems is &quot;Die Mädcheninsel&quot;, an elegy which met with the warm approval of Frederick the Great. Other works were &quot;Thamire an die Rosen&quot; and &quot;An eine Romansleserin&quot;.

Götz&#x27;s &quot;Vermischte Gedichte&quot; were published with biography by K. W. Ramler (Mannheim, 1785; new ed., 1807), and a collection of his poems, dating from the years 1745–1765, was edited by C. Schüddekopf in the &quot;Deutsche Literaturdenkmale des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts&quot; (1893). See also &quot;Briefe von und an J. N. Götz&quot;, edited by C. Schüddekopf (1893).

<doc id="1296558" wikidata="Q235174" url="?curid=1296558" title="Yolande of Aragon">
<text>Yolande of Aragon (11 August 1381 – 14 November 1442) was Duchess of Anjou and Countess of Provence by marriage, who acted as regent of Provence during the minority of her son. She was also known as Yolanda de Aragón and Violant d&#x27;Aragó. Tradition holds that she commissioned the famous Rohan Hours.

==Family and marriage==
Yolande was born in Zaragoza, Aragon, on 11 August 1381, the eldest daughter of King John I of Aragon by his second wife, Yolande of Bar, the granddaughter of King John II of France. She had three brothers and two sisters, as well as five older half-siblings from her father&#x27;s first marriage to Martha of Armagnac. Yolande later played an important role in the politics of England, France, and Aragon during the first half of the 15th century.

In 1387, Yolande&#x27;s parents received a marriage proposal for the newly crowned King of Naples, Louis II, through his mother, Marie of Blois. When she was eleven, Yolande signed a document to disavow any promises made by ambassadors about her marrying Louis II. In 1395, Richard II of England also opened negotiations for Yolande&#x27;s hand. To prevent this marriage, Charles VI of France offered his own daughter Isabella to King Richard. After the death of Yolande&#x27;s father, Marie of Blois convinced Yolande&#x27;s uncle Martin I of Aragon to have Yolande wed Louis II. Yolande signed a protest, but was forced to retract it later. The couple married in Arles on December 2, 1400. Despite Yolande&#x27;s earlier objections and the later illnesses of her husband, the marriage was a success.

==Claim to the Aragonese throne==

As the surviving daughter of King John I of Aragon, she claimed the throne of Aragon after the deaths of her elder sister Joanna, Countess of Foix, and her uncle, King Martin I. However, unclear though they were, the laws of succession for Aragon and Barcelona at that time were understood to favour all male relatives over the females (which is how Yolande&#x27;s uncle Martin of Aragon came to inherit the throne of Aragon). Martin died without surviving issue in 1410, and after two years without a king, the Estates of Aragon elected Ferdinand, the second son of Eleanor of Aragon and John I of Castile, as the next King of Aragon.

The Anjou candidate for the throne of Aragon was Yolande&#x27;s eldest son Louis III of Anjou, Duke of Calabria, whose claim was forfeited in the Pact of Caspe. Yolande and her sons regarded themselves as the heirs with the stronger claim and began to use the title of Kings of Aragon. As a result of this additional inheritance, Yolande was called the &quot;Queen of Four Kingdoms&quot; - the four apparently Sicily, Jerusalem, Cyprus and Aragon. Another interpretation specifies Naples separate from Sicily, plus Jerusalem and Aragon. The number could be raised to seven if the two component kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon (Majorca and Valencia) and Sardinia were included. However, the reality was that Yolande and her family controlled territories in these kingdoms only at short intervals, if ever. Their true realm was the Anjou fiefdoms across France: they held uncontestably the provinces of Provence and Anjou, and also at times Bar, Maine, Touraine and Valois. Yolande&#x27;s son René I of Anjou became ruler of Lorraine through his marriage to Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine.

==France and the House of Anjou==

In the emerging second phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Yolande chose to support the French (in particular the Armagnac party) against the English and the Burgundians. After John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, instigated a mob attack on the Dauphin of France in 1413, she and her husband repudiated the engagement of their son Louis to John&#x27;s daughter Catherine of Burgundy, which placed them decisively in the Armagnac camp. In the same year, Yolande met with Queen Isabeau of France to finalize a marriage contract between her daughter Marie and Isabeau&#x27;s third surviving son Charles.

After his two older brothers died, she supported the claim of the Dauphin Charles who, relying upon Yolande&#x27;s resources and help, succeeded in becoming crowned Charles VII of France. Yolande arranged the marriage of Charles to her daughter Marie of Anjou, thus becoming Charles&#x27; mother-in-law. This led to Yolande&#x27;s personal involvement in the struggle for the survival of the House of Valois in France.

Yolande&#x27;s marriage to Louis II of Anjou, at Arles in December 1400, was arranged as a part of long-standing efforts to resolve contested claims upon the kingdom of Sicily and Naples between the houses of Anjou and Aragon. Louis spent much of his life fighting in Italy for his claim to the Kingdom of Naples. In France, Yolande was the Duchess of Anjou and the Countess of Provence. She preferred to hold court in Angers and Saumur. She had six children, and through her second son René was the grandmother of Margaret of Anjou, the wife of King Henry VI of England.

With the victory of the English over the French at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the Duchy of Anjou was threatened. The French king, Charles VI, was mentally ill and his realm was in a state of civil war between the Burgundians and the Orleanists (Armagnacs). The situation was made worse by an alliance between the Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, the English, and the French queen, Isabeau of Bavaria, who submitted to the Duke of Burgundy&#x27;s scheme to deny the crown of France to the children of Charles VI. Fearing the abusive power building behind the Duke of Burgundy, Louis II had Yolande move with her children and future son-in-law, Charles, to Provence in southern France.

==The Dauphin==

In the years 1415 and 1417, the two oldest surviving sons of Charles VI of France died in quick succession: first Louis, then Jean. Both brothers had been in the care of the Duke of Burgundy. Yolande was the protectress of her son-in-law, Charles, who became the new Dauphin. She refused Queen Isabeau&#x27;s orders to return Charles to the French Court; according to Jehan de Bourdigné, when asked she replied , &quot;We have not nurtured and cherished this one for you to make him die like his brothers or to go mad like his father, or to become English like you. I keep him for my own. Come and take him away, if you dare.&quot;

On 29 April 1417, Louis II of Anjou died of illness, leaving Yolande, at age 33, in control of the House of Anjou. She acted as regent for her son because of his youth. She also had the fate of the French royal house of Valois in her hands. Her young son-in-law, the Dauphin Charles, was exceptionally vulnerable to the designs of the English King, Henry V, and to his older cousin, John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy. Charles&#x27; nearest older relatives, the Dukes of Orléans and of Bourbon, had been made prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt and were held captive by the English. With his mother, Queen Isabeau, and the Duke of Burgundy allied with the English, Charles had no resources to support him other than those of the House of Anjou and the smaller House of Armagnac.

Following the assassination of John the Fearless at Montereau in 1419, his son Philip the Good succeeded him as Duke of Burgundy. With Henry V of England, Philip forced the Treaty of Troyes (21 May 1420) on the mentally-ill King Charles VI. The treaty designated Henry as &quot;Regent of France&quot; and heir to the French throne. Following this, the Dauphin Charles was declared disinherited in 1421. When both Henry V of England and Charles VI of France died in 1422 (on 31 August and 21 October, respectively), the Dauphin Charles, at age 19, legitimately became Charles VII of France. Charles&#x27; title was challenged by the English and their Burgundian allies, who supported the candidacy of Henry VI of England, the infant son of Henry V and Catherine of Valois, Charles&#x27; own sister, as king of France. This set the stage for the last phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War: the &quot;War of Charles VII&quot;.

In this struggle, Yolande played a prominent role in surrounding the young Valois king with advisers and servants associated with the House of Anjou. She manoeuvred John VI, Duke of Brittany, into breaking an alliance with the English, and was responsible for a soldier from the Breton ducal family, Arthur de Richemont, becoming Constable of France in 1425. Using the Constable de Richemont, Yolande was behind the forceful removal of several of Charles VII&#x27;s advisers. Thus, La Trémoille was attacked and forced from the court in 1433.

The contemporary chronicler Jean Juvenal des Ursins (1433–44), Bishop of Beauvais, described Yolande as &quot;the prettiest woman in the kingdom.&quot; Bourdigné, chronicler of the house of Anjou, says of her: &quot;She who was said to be the wisest and most beautiful princess in Christendom.&quot; Later, King Louis XI of France recalled that his grandmother had &quot;a man&#x27;s heart in a woman&#x27;s body.&quot; A twentieth-century French author, Jehanne d&#x27;Orliac, wrote one of the few works specifically on Yolande, and noted that the duchess remains unappreciated for her genius and influence in the reign of Charles VII. &quot;She is mentioned in passing because she is the pivot of all important events for forty-two years in France&quot;, while &quot;Joan [of Arc] was in the public eye only eleven months.&quot;

Yolande retired to Angers and then to Saumur. She continued to play a role in politics. When the bishopric in Angers fell vacant, she threatened Charles VII&#x27;s candidate with beheading if he showed up in the city. The king backed down and the post went to her secretary. At least from 1439 onwards, her granddaughter Margaret of Anjou came to live with her. Yolande taught her not only etiquette and literature, but also how to check account books. Her last act before her death was to prepare Margaret for a possible marriage with Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. She received his ambassadors in Samur and presented her granddaughter to them. She died at the town house of the Seigneur de Tucé in Saumur on 14 November 1442.

==Marriage and issue==
She was betrothed in 1390 to Louis, the heir of Anjou (who had one year earlier succeeded in conquering Naples and become King Louis II of Naples), and married him on 2 December 1400 at Montpellier. Their children were:

# Louis III of Anjou (25 September 1403 – 12 November 1434), Duke of Anjou, Titular King of Naples. He was adopted by Queen Joanna II of Naples. Married Margaret of Savoy. Died childless;
# Marie of Anjou (14 October 1404 – 29 November 1463). Married in 1422 King Charles VII of France. Had issue including King Louis XI of France;
# René I of Naples (16 January 1409 – 10 July 1480), Duke of Anjou and Bar, Duke Consort of Lorraine, Titular King of Sicily and Naples. Married Duchess Isabella of Lorraine. They were the parents of Margaret of Anjou, Queen-Consort of England.
# Yolande of Anjou (13 August 1412 – 17 July 1440). Married in 1431 Francis, Count of Montfort l&#x27;Amaury, who succeeded his father in 1442 as Duke of Brittany. 
# Charles of Anjou (14 October 1414 – 10 April 1472), Count of Maine (who never was Duke of Anjou, but his namesake son was). Married firstly Cobella Ruffo and secondly Isabelle de St.Pol, Countess of Guise. Had issue by both marriages.
