<text>Big Wreck are a Canadian-American rock band formed by Ian Thornley and Brian Doherty in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1992. The band was rounded out with David Henning and Forrest Williams. They disbanded in 2002 and Ian Thornley pursued a solo career with his own band Thornley. In 2010, Ian Thornley and Brian Doherty reunited for a cross-Canada tour, playing both Big Wreck and Thornley songs. In 2012, under the name Big Wreck, the band released their third studio album, &quot;Albatross&quot;. The band has since released the albums &quot;Ghosts&quot; in 2014, &quot;Grace Street&quot; in 2017, &quot;...But for the Sun&quot; in 2019, and &quot;7&quot; in 2023.

==History==
===Formation as Still Waters, &quot;In Loving Memory Of...&quot; (1992–2000)===
Big Wreck was originally formed in Boston, Massachusetts by guitarist Ian Thornley, guitarist Brian Doherty, bassist Dave Henning and drummer Forest Williams while they were students at the Berklee College of Music. Henning and Doherty were previously part of the band Divine Right with lead singer Jim McDermott and drummer Dave Tuohy. The future Big Wreck lineup began jamming and playing gigs together under the name Still Waters in 1992. Unsatisfied with their name, they set out to choose a new official band name, and according to Thornley they settled upon the name Big Wreck in 1994 after something went wrong during a rehearsal session and Doherty exclaimed the session was a &quot;big wreck&quot;. Upon their formation, Thornley was not the original singer of the band, but he became the singer after the band couldn&#x27;t find one. In early 1995, the band recorded and released their first known demo tape which featured six songs, one of which was the original recording of &quot;Overemphasizing&quot; which would be later remixed and remastered for their debut album. The other five songs have yet to see a commercial release. After a few years of gigging in the Boston area and Toronto, the band got signed to Atlantic Records and released their debut album &quot;In Loving Memory Of...&quot; in 1997. In the US, their single &quot;The Oaf (My Luck Is Wasted)&quot; reached the top ten on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart in early 1998. Four months later, their follow-up single &quot;That Song&quot; reached the top 40 on that same chart. The band found even bigger commercial success in Canada, scoring 4 top 40 hits on the Canadian Singles Chart. The band went on a 17-date tour to publicize their releases.

===&quot;The Pleasure and the Greed&quot;, breakup, other projects (2000–2003)===
Big Wreck released their second album, &quot;The Pleasure and the Greed&quot;, in June 2001. Three singles were released, all of which failed to chart in the U.S.

In October of that year, the band played a special show at Toronto&#x27;s Roy Thomson Hall accompanied by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Uzume Taiko Ensemble of drummers, guitarist Eric Johnson and The Tragically Hip&#x27;s Paul Langlois and Robby Baker.

The band broke up in early 2003. Ian Thornley moved back to Toronto and formed the band Thornley. Brian Doherty moved to Camlachie, a small community near Sarnia, Ontario, where he taught guitar and prepared students for University or Conservatory entrance requirements. Doherty also went on to form the indie rock band Death of 8.
===Reunion, &quot;Albatross&quot;, and &quot;Bag of Tricks&quot; (2010–2014)===
In 2010, Doherty filled in as guitarist at a Thornley show during the &quot;Tiny Pictures&quot; tour, and that led to Doherty joining the band as a touring member. Later that year, a new tour promoted as &quot;An Evening with Thornley and Big Wreck&quot; followed, and as a result of the tour&#x27;s success, the band assumed the Big Wreck moniker, including the existing members of Thornley in the new Big Wreck. In secret, Big Wreck had worked on a reunion album which would later be announced as &quot;Albatross&quot;. After recording the album, signing to Anthem, and departing from 604 Records in July 2011, drummer Christopher Henry left the group and was replaced with touring drummer Brad Park. In November 2011, Big Wreck released the lead single and title track off their upcoming album, &quot;Albatross&quot; their first single release in over ten years. The song received praise and chart success in both the US and Canada, eventually earning the band&#x27;s first #1 hit.

On February 5, 2012, Big Wreck performed at the Sound Academy in Toronto for Canada&#x27;s Official Super Bowl XLVI party. They also completed two tours that year, touring Canada from British Columbia to Ontario from April to July, then accompanying Theory of a Deadman for their Jingle Bell Rock tour from November to December, at which time Brad Park was replaced with Chuck Keeping on drums. On June 25, 2013, the band released their first EP, &quot;Bag of Tricks&quot;, which was compiled of live recordings from the Albatross Tour and a cover of The Cars&#x27; &quot;Good Times Roll.&quot; It was released as a digital exclusive.

===&quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Grace Street&quot; (2014–2018)===
In 2014, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Ghosts&quot;. The album was released in Canada on June 10, 2014, and in the US in July. The album reached #5 on the Canadian Albums Chart and #4 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums Chart. The album was nominated for &quot;Rock Album of the Year&quot; at the Juno Awards of 2015.

In November 2016, Big Wreck released a new single &quot;One Good Piece Of Me&quot; from their upcoming album, &quot;Grace Street&quot;.

On January 5, 2017, after the recording of &quot;Grace Street&quot;, but prior to its release, guitarist Paulo Neta departed from Big Wreck. Ian Thornley wrote the following on Big Wreck&#x27;s Facebook page:

&quot;Grace Street&quot; was released on February 3, 2017. The band embarked on a 31-date tour in support of the album, with supporting act Ascot Royals.

===20th anniversary tour, Brian Doherty&#x27;s death, ...&quot;But for the Sun&quot; (2018–2020)===
In 2018, Big Wreck embarked on a 35-date North American tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;In Loving Memory Of...&quot;, in which they performed every song from the album at each show. Attica Riots were the supporting act for the tour. The album was also physically reissued the same year featuring new artwork and two previously unreleased outtakes from the recording sessions, plus the album&#x27;s first ever vinyl press.

On February 22, 2019, Big Wreck released a new single, &quot;Locomotive&quot;, from their upcoming album, &quot;...But for the Sun&quot;. In a promotional interview soon after, Ian Thornley revealed the titles of several other upcoming songs from the album, including &quot;Follow Me,&quot; &quot;Give Us a Smile,&quot; and &quot;Found My Place.&quot; On May 10, 2019, the band released a follow-up single, entitled &quot;Too Far Gone.&quot;

Brian Doherty (born on April 2, 1968) died of lung cancer on June 5, 2019, at age 51. The band performed their previously scheduled shows as a trio, with Chris Caddell joining the band later that year. On July 22, 2019, the band released a third single entitled &quot;One More Chance,&quot; along with a release date and a tracklist of &quot;...But for the Sun.&quot; The album was released on August 30, 2019. The band embarked on a 49-date tour in support of the record, with Texas King as the supporting act.

===&quot;7&quot; (2020–2023)===
In early 2021, Big Wreck announced that they had been working on new music for a follow-up to &quot;...But for the Sun&quot;. They had recorded 15 songs for a new album, but had discussed releasing them in increments as opposed to the conventional full-length album format. This was due to Ian Thornley&#x27;s belief in how music is consumed differently nowadays, and felt like fans would be able to take in the large amount of new material more easily by releasing a handful of songs at a time. It was also announced around this time that long-time drummer Chuck Keeping had left the group amicably to focus on family, and former Thornley drummer Sekou Lumumba had joined the band as their new drummer.

In the summer of 2021, the band released two one-off singles with the help of Chad Kroeger of Nickelback entitled &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Ought to Be,&quot; the first of which became their highest charting single in Canada since &quot;Albatross,&quot; peaking at #4. These songs were seen as a slight departure of style from the music the band usually releases, due to the more pop-influenced nature of the songs, similar to that of the Thornley albums from the 2000s. They would also be the final songs the band recorded with Chuck Keeping. The band also released their &quot;Bag of Tricks&quot; EP on limited edition coloured vinyl for Record Store Day.

On October 7, 2021, Big Wreck announced the upcoming release of &quot;7.1&quot;, the first of three EPs (the latter consequently titled &quot;7.2&quot; and &quot;7.3&quot;) that will be released individually and eventually put together to make the band&#x27;s seventh full-length album. The lead single from the project &quot;Bombs Away,&quot; was released the same day. A second single &quot;Fields&quot; (featuring Daniel Greaves of The Watchmen, and Ian D&#x27;Sa of Billy Talent on backing vocals) was released on November 12, 2021. &quot;7.1&quot; was released on November 19, 2021, and the band announced a 15-date tour of Canada. The first half of the tour was postponed to Spring 2022 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. BRKN LOVE and Monster Truck were the supporting acts for the tour. This was also the band&#x27;s final campaign with Warner Music Canada before independently distributing and promoting their band under their own label, Big Wreck Music. The band released a cover of Sting&#x27;s &quot;Russians&quot; to their Bandcamp website on March 4, 2022, in response to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. All proceeds from the release were donated to the UNHRC. On May 6, 2022, the band released the third single of the project, entitled &quot;Spit It Out,&quot; to Canadian radio stations. On June 1, 2022, the band announced the release &quot;7.2&quot; along with a campaign that allows people to pre-order the EP in several different formats, one of which featuring a bonus track. Each pre-order will allow people to enter a draw to win a turntable and with a one-off pressing of the EP. The same day, a fourth single &quot;Better Off,&quot; was made available on streaming services. &quot;7.2&quot; was released on June 17, 2022. The band played various festivals and one-off summer shows to promote the EP. On September 30, 2022, the fifth single &quot;Fear &amp; Cowardice&quot; was released to radio with a music video featuring live footage from an exclusive show at The Horseshoe Tavern that took place on July 21, 2022, Ian Thornley&#x27;s 50th birthday. On November 24, 2022, bassist Dave McMillan hosted an exclusive livestream and confirmed that &quot;7.3&quot; would be released on March 24, 2023. On March 10, 2023, &quot;7.3&quot; was made available for digital pre-order and pre-save along with the sixth single of the project &quot;Melody &amp; Sound.&quot; &quot;7.3&quot; was released on March 24, 2023. The album was also released as a composite cassette with all three EPs put together. The band embarked on a tour with over 60 dates in support of &quot;7&quot; across Canada and the US over the course of the remainder of 2023. The Standstills, Texas King, Vilivant, and Daniel Greaves are supporting acts throughout the tour. On February 29, 2024, the band officially released &quot;7&quot; as a composite album to the general public as a triple vinyl gatefold package, a triple CD package, and a single cassette format. This officially concluded the release cycle of the record.

===&quot;Pages,&quot; &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot;, and Thornley reunion (2023–present)===
On May 24, 2023, Ian Thornley shared in-studio footage on Instagram of Big Wreck recording what&#x27;s speculated to be a follow-up to &quot;7&quot;, with producer Nick Raskulinecz, who co-produced both &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot; with Big Wreck&#x27;s long-time engineer and producer Eric Ratz. On October 4, 2023, the band officially announced their fourth studio EP, &quot;Pages&quot;, which consists of 6 out of 18 brand new songs that were recorded in two weeks. It was released on November 24, 2023 and was promoted with a 29-date North American tour. Texas King and Daniel Greaves were the supporting acts. Throughout 2024, Big Wreck performed many more shows to further promote the EP, including the single &quot;Summerlong,&quot; which became the most successful single from the project and displayed, along with the rest of the EP, a deeper exploration of the band&#x27;s new wave and progressive pop influences, featuring prominent synthesizers and gated drums. Ian Thornley hosted an exclusive Q&amp;A session in the summer, where it was confirmed that the remaining 12 songs from the sessions will eventually be released as the band&#x27;s eighth full-length album, titled &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot;, at some point in 2025.

In May 2024, the band announced that they would be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Thornley album &quot;Come Again&quot; by temporarily re-adopting the Thornley moniker for the first time in 13 years. They performed two one-off shows in Canada, where they exclusively played songs from both Thornley albums, some of which have not been performed live since their release. The band also remastered and reissued the album on streaming services with previously unreleased bonus tracks, and on vinyl for the first time ever. The band then reverted back to the Big Wreck moniker and announced two more one-off shows for March 2025, billed as &quot;Big Wreck &amp; Thornley&quot;. The band will be performing both as Thornley and as Big Wreck, opening for themselves and playing both eras of their lineup.

<doc id="1305441" wikidata="Q830078" url="?curid=1305441" title="Bessarion station">
<text>Bessarion is a station on Line 4 Sheppard of the Toronto subway. Opened in 2002, it is the least-used station on the heavy-rail portion of the subway system , with an average of 3,180 passengers per weekday.

== History ==
Due to numerous budget overruns that occurred during the construction of the Sheppard line, the TTC contemplated abandoning the plan to construct Bessarion station to save money. However, a decision was ultimately reached in October 1998 to proceed with building the station. This decision was influenced by the potential for redevelopment in the surrounding area. Councillor David Shiner played a key role in advocating for the station, highlighting its importance as a selling factor for proposed housing units.

During the excavation of the site, it was discovered that the soil had been contaminated with hydrocarbons, believed to be from the two filling stations that had previously occupied the area. As a precautionary measure, the soil was removed and decontaminated during the construction of the station.

In the mid-2000s, Line 4 was dubbed a &quot;white elephant&quot; due to its low ridership levels. TTC officials joked that &quot;keeping ticket sellers awake is the biggest challenge amid the boredom that is Bessarion station&quot;.

In 2007, developer Concord Adex began construction on Concord Park Place, an condominium and townhouse development, next to Bessarion. Upon completion, the development will include 20 residential towers, 2 schools, a combined community centre and library, and a new public park. Initially, the project was criticized for being located too far from the station, but the developer asserted that the community centre would increase Bessarion&#x27;s ridership. The Ethennonnhawahstihnen&#x27; Community Recreation Centre, located to the south of the station, opened in July 2023. Other residential developments in the vicinity of the station have also been proposed.

Between 2008 and 2018, ridership at Bessarion increased by 3 percent, in stark contrast to the 14 percent surge in ridership along all of Line 4. The station had roughly half the amount of passengers at Don Mills, the second-busiest station on the line.

== Station description ==

<text>Leslie is a station on Line 4 Sheppard of the Toronto subway system. It is located at 1209 Sheppard Avenue East at Old Leslie Street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was opened in 2002.

==History==
Leslie station opened for public viewing on November 22, 2002, along with the rest of the Sheppard subway line and for revenue service on November 24, 2002.

On December 22, 2016, this station and were the last subway stations to be equipped with Presto card readers.

==Station description==

The station is on three levels. The bus platforms are on the upper level at Old Leslie Street, with an automatic accessible entrance. The concourse and collector are at an intermediate level, where the main fully accessible entrance is located on the south side of Sheppard Avenue East west of Leslie Street. There is a secondary automatic accessible entrance at the corner of Leslie Street directly to the easterly end of the subway platform, which is at the lowest level.

The station features 102 spaces of commuter parking. Cost is $7 per day or $2 per hour from 5:00 am to 2:00 am daily. As with all TTC lots, no overnight parking is allowed between 2:00 am and 5:00 am.

==Architecture and art==

The public art in the station, entitled &quot;Ampersand&quot; and created by Canadian artist Micah Lexier, consists of 17,000 ceramic tiles, each with a printed ampersand between the words &quot;Sheppard&quot; and &quot;Leslie&quot;, based on 3,400 different pieces of handwriting from the community collected in 1997.

According to the artist&#x27;s statement posted in the station, this piece of artwork &quot;acknowledges the duality of being both an individual and part of a larger community.&quot; This piece can be seen on both the concourse and platform levels, including the bus terminal.
==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
Just east of the station, the line emerges from the subway tunnel to cross the Don River East Branch on a fully enclosed bridge, then returns into the tunnel. West of the station, the subway continues through its tunnels into Bessarion station.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include the East Don River, the Betty Sutherland Trail, North York General Hospital and the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (formerly Seneca College&#x27;s School of Nursing).
==Surface connections==
===Toronto Transit Commission===
TTC routes serving the station include:
A bus terminal, located one level above the concourse, is integrated with Leslie station. Although the terminal is quite spacious and has several bus bays, it currently only serves the 51 Leslie route. The 85 Sheppard East route can only be boarded on the street with a valid transfer.

===GO Transit===
Leslie station is located north of Oriole Station on GO Transit&#x27;s Richmond Hill line, but they are not adjacent. No action has yet been taken on proposals to relocate the GO Station to connect directly with the subway. Passengers wishing to transfer to the GO Station are directed to the exit outside the bus terminal; a short walk to the intersection of Old Leslie Street and Esther Shiner Boulevard brings pedestrians to a walkway which connects to the north end of the GO platform.

<doc id="1305457" wikidata="Q1156726" url="?curid=1305457" title="Rodeo Drive">
<text>Rodeo Drive is a street in Beverly Hills, California, with its southern segment in the City of Los Angeles, known as one of the most expensive streets in the world. Its southern terminus is at Beverwil Drive, and its northern terminus is at its intersection with Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills. The name is most commonly used metonymically to refer to the three-block stretch of the street between Wilshire Boulevard and Little Santa Monica Boulevard.

==Pronunciation==
The word &quot;rodeo&quot; as a term referring to the cowboy sports can be pronounced with the stress on either the first () or second () syllable; the latter is its Spanish pronunciation. For the street in Beverly Hills, however, only the latter pronunciation is used; the former pronunciation is used to refer to Rodeo Road in Los Angeles, which has since been renamed Obama Boulevard.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1906, Burton E. Green (1868–1965) and other investors purchased the property that would become Beverly Hills, formerly named Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas, with plans for a mixed-use subdivision with a branch of the Los Angeles and Pacific Railway running North on Rodeo Drive before turning west at Sunset Boulevard. They platted the street that very year, in 1906. By 1907, parcels on Rodeo were selling for $1,100 each. It became a bridle path in 1912, when the Beverly Hills Hotel was built on a former lima bean field. By November 1925, similar lots were selling for between $15,000 and $30,000, almost double what they&#x27;d been selling for in September. Pacific Electric Red Cars operated over the street to the Beverly Hills Hotel as the Coldwater Canyon Line between 1907 and 1923.
The central part of Rodeo eventually became a business street with hardware stores, gas stations, beauty shops, and bookstores. The men&#x27;s store Carroll &amp; Company opened shop on Rodeo Drive in 1950. The Anderton Court Shops building at 332 N. Rodeo was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1952. In 1958, real estate developer Marvin Kratter bought of land at the corner of Rodeo and Wilshire Boulevard from the city of Beverly Hills. The acreage is across the street from the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and Kratter paid something over $2 million for it.

===Origin of a new image===

In 1961 Fred Hayman, &quot;the father of Rodeo Drive,&quot; opened Giorgio Beverly Hills, the street&#x27;s first high-end boutique. In 1968 Aldo Gucci opened a store on Rodeo, which catalyzed the process by which the street took on its present form. Van Cleef &amp; Arpels opened in 1969, followed by a Vidal Sassoon salon in 1970. The Polo Store, the brand&#x27;s first freestanding store, opened in 1971.

According to a former co-chair of the &quot;Rodeo Drive Committee,&quot; Richard Carroll, the transformation of Rodeo Drive into an international center of fashionable shopping was sparked in 1971 with the opening of a new wing of the Beverly Wilshire. In 1980 Carroll noted that before then &quot;There was nothing at all of an international nature on the street. Rodeo was purely local in flavor.&quot; In 1977 the Rodeo Drive Committee &quot;launched a publicity campaign designed to make everyone around the world think of Rodeo Drive as the shopping street of the rich and famous.&quot; The RDC wanted to make Rodeo Drive an economic engine for Beverly Hills and spread the image of a &quot;culturally elite lifestyle.&quot;

In 1976, Bijan Pakzad opened a showroom on Rodeo, which helped to solidify &quot;Rodeo Drive&#x27;s reputation as a luxury shopping destination.&quot; Pakzad touted his Rodeo Drive store as &quot;the most expensive in the world,&quot; but, as &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; notes in relation to the claim, &quot;he was known for hyperbole.&quot; By 1978 the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce was boasting that Rodeo Drive was &quot;the essence of the best of all the shopping centers of the world&quot; and by 1980 the city of Beverly Hills estimated that the Rodeo Drive shopping district accounted for as much as 25% of its sales tax revenues.

===International fashion centre===
By 1981, the high-fashion strip took up only two and a half blocks, with around 65 stores.

The &quot;Rodeo Collection,&quot; a 45-store, shopping mall opened in 1983 at 421 N. Rodeo Drive. The building is only four stories high with the first floor below street level in order to satisfy local building codes. The retail space initially leased for as much as $120 per square foot, which, according to an executive with commercial real estate firm Julien J. Studley, was &quot;the highest price for any kind of space in the Los Angeles Area.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Rodeo Drive was ranked 4th most-visited destination in the Los Angeles area (after Disneyland, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm and Universal Studios).

Two Rodeo Drive, another outdoor shopping center, was built in 1990. It initially housed, amongst other stores, Christian Dior and Valentino. The original developer, Douglas Stitzel, sold the property for about $200 million immediately after its completion. Two Japanese groups, Kowa Real Estate California Inc. and USA Sogo Inc, bought 40% of Two Rodeo Drive.

The Two Rodeo Drive shopping center was hard-hit by the early 1990s recession, with occupancy rates dropping to as low as 60%. Middle-market brand boutiques such as Guess Jeans and Banana Republic opened on Rodeo Drive. Many franchised stores were bought back by the brands they represented (Polo Ralph Lauren, Gianni Versace, Hugo Boss).

The Two Rodeo Drive buyers sold it at an almost $70 million loss in 2000. By 2007 the property was financially stable again and was sold to a group of Irish investors for $275 million. It resembles a &quot;faux-European shopping alley&quot; and features a cobblestone street. Some architects have claimed that Two Rodeo Drive is similar to a &quot;theme park in the manner of Disneyland.&quot;

===Walk of Style===


In 2003, Rodeo Drive was given an $18 million makeover which included widening the streets and the addition of crosswalks. The ficus trees lining the street were taken out and replaced with palm trees. In September of the same year, the Rodeo Drive Committee developed the Rodeo Drive Walk of Style. The Walk of Style features plaques set in the sidewalks along Rodeo Drive. Fashion icons are honored with the award for their work in style and fashion. At the intersection of Rodeo Drive and Dayton Way is the nude sculpture entitled &quot;Torso.&quot; This statue was created by sculptor Robert Graham and is the symbol for the Rodeo Drive Walk of Style. Recipients of the Rodeo Drive Walk of Style Award receive a &quot;Torso&quot; maquette also designed by artist Robert Graham.

The French fashion firm Lanvin opened a store on Rodeo Drive in 2011.

===2020 lootings===
In May 2020, several of Rodeo Drive&#x27;s businesses were damaged and looted following the murder of George Floyd. It was reported that several windows were broken and many of the looted buildings were vandalized by spray paint.

<doc id="1305458" wikidata="Q1042199" url="?curid=1305458" title="Don Mills station">
<text>Don Mills is a subway station that is the eastern terminus of Line 4 Sheppard in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station is at the northeast corner of Sheppard Avenue East and Don Mills Road, within the residential communities of Don Valley Village and Henry Farm, adjacent to Fairview Mall. The station is close to Highways 401 and 404, as well as the Don Valley Parkway. Other nearby landmarks include Georges Vanier Secondary School and the Fairview branch of the Toronto Public Library.

==History==
The station opened in 2002 as part of the original Line 4. A plaque at the platform level commemorates John Marinzel, a worker who died on April 18, 2001, of injuries from an accident during the construction of the station. A Vivastation for the Viva Green line of York Region&#x27;s Viva Rapid Transit system opened on October 16, 2005.

==Description==
Like all stations on the Sheppard line, Don Mills is fully accessible. The station is equipped with three elevators connecting the concourse level with the bus platforms and two street entrances, and a single elevator between the island train platform and the concourse. Stairs and escalators provide regular pedestrian access between all levels.

There are three accessible entrances around the Don Mills Road and Sheppard Avenue intersection. Two of the entrances are on the northeast and southeast sides of Sheppard Avenue, respectively, and one automatic entrance in the parking garage at Fairview Mall near the Marshalls/HomeSense entrance.

Above the bus terminal, on the street level, is a multi-storey public parking lot with 366 parking spaces for commuters.

== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==
 As this is a terminal station, there is a diamond crossover to the west of the platform for arriving trains to cross over to the westbound track, and for departing trains on the eastbound track to cross to the westbound track. There are also tail tracks beyond the east end of the platform. However, unlike other terminal stations where the tail tracks are at least as long as a standard six-car train for overnight storage, those at Don Mills are only about two cars in length. This is likely because storage capacity is available at Sheppard–Yonge, which can store enough trains to service the line.
==Architecture and art==
The station was designed by Stevens Group Architects, who also built and stations.

There are two pieces of public art in the station. The piece &quot;before/after&quot; spans the concourse and platform levels in the station. Created by Toronto artist Stephen Cruise, it consists of tile work on walls and inlays on the terrazzo floors:
*On the concourse level, the tilework on walls represents the geologic strata through which the line travels, plus graphical depictions of local flora and fauna.
*On the concourse and platform levels, bronze inlays in the floor depict fossils of fish, turtles, and leaves found on the site; the Sheppard line is also depicted in an abstract form on the floor.

Outside the station (on the north side of Don Mills Road, south of the bus entrance) is a tribute to Northern Dancer, a famous racehorse foaled at E. P. Taylor&#x27;s Windfields Farm, which was then located on Bayview Avenue.

In mid-2021, to celebrate the TTC&#x27;s 100th anniversary, a temporary art installation titled &quot;Sheppard Subway Construction&quot; was put on display at the station. Located on the concourse level, the installation consisted of various enlarged photographs showcasing the construction of Line 4 Sheppard.

==Surface connections==
Don Mills station has a bus terminal that is also underground. It allows for connection to both TTC bus routes and York Region Transit (YRT) routes.

===Toronto Transit Commission routes===
When the subway is closed, passengers may board buses at the intersection of Don Mills Road and Sheppard Avenue outside the station.
===York Region Transit routes===
Several York Region Transit (YRT) bus routes also operate to and from Don Mills station. Under Ontario&#x27;s One Fare Program that began on February 26, 2024, customers paying by credit, debit or Presto card can transfer between YRT and TTC services without incurring an additional fare. As free card transfers need to be recorded for reimbursements as well as to enforce double-fare payments for riders ineligible for free transfers between YRT and TTC services, YRT buses drop off passengers outside of the station and pick up passengers inside the station and at on-street stops outside the station. 

The subway station was formerly the southern terminus for the Viva Green line of YRT&#x27;s Viva Rapid Transit until that service was initially temporarily suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and discontinued permanently in 2023.

==Prior proposals==
As part of the Transit City plan, the TTC proposed the construction of the Sheppard LRT (light rail transit) line to connect Don Mills station to Sheppard East station on the proposed extension of Line 3 Scarborough. This replaced previous plans to extend Line 4 Sheppard to Scarborough Centre station on Line 3.

The Transit City plan included an LRT along Don Mills Road from Pape station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth through Don Mills station to Steeles Avenue. However, the transit line, along with other Transit City lines, was cancelled by Rob Ford when he became mayor in December 2010.

In a 2015 study, one of the options for a proposed Toronto relief line connected to Don Mills Station.

<doc id="1305464" wikidata="Q289246" url="?curid=1305464" title="Étienne Maurice Falconet">
<text>Étienne Maurice Falconet (1 December 1716 – 24 January 1791) was a French baroque, rococo and neoclassical sculptor, best-known for his equestrian statue of Peter the Great, the &quot;Bronze Horseman&quot; (1782), in St. Petersburg, Russia, and for the small statues he produced in series for the Royal Sévres Porcelain Manufactory

==Life and work==

Falconet was born to a poor family in Paris. He was at first apprenticed to a marble-cutter, but some of his clay and wood figures, with the making of which he occupied his leisure hours, attracted the notice of the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, who made him his pupil. One of his most successful early sculptures was of Milo of Croton, which secured his admission to the membership of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1754.

He came to prominent public attention in the Salons of 1755 and 1757 with his marbles of &quot;L&#x27;Amour&quot; (Cupid) and the &quot;Nymphe descendant au bain&quot; (also called &quot;The Bather&quot;), which is now at the Louvre. In 1757 Falconet was appointed by the Marquise de Pompadour as director of the sculpture atelier of the new &quot;Manufacture royale de porcelaine&quot; at Sèvres, where he brought new life to the manufacture of unglazed soft-paste porcelain figurines, small-scale sculptures that had been a specialty at the predecessor of the Sèvres manufactory, Vincennes.

The influence of the painter François Boucher and of contemporary theater and ballet are equally in evidence in Falconet&#x27;s subjects, and in his sweet, elegantly erotic, somewhat coy manner. Right at the start, in the 1750s, Falconet created for Sèvres a set of white biscuit porcelain garnitures of tabletop putti (Falconet&#x27;s &quot;Enfants&quot;) illustrating &quot;the Arts,&quot; and meant to complement the manufacture&#x27;s grand dinner service (&quot;Service du Roy&quot;). The fashion for similar small table sculptures spread to most of the porcelain manufacturies of Europe.
He remained at the Sèvres post until he was invited to Russia by Catherine the Great in September 1766. At St Petersburg he executed a colossal statue of Peter the Great in bronze, known as the &quot;Bronze Horseman&quot;, together with his pupil and then daughter-in-law Marie-Anne Collot. In 1788, back in Paris, he became Assistant Rector of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Many of Falconet&#x27;s religious works, commissioned for churches, were destroyed at the time of the French Revolution. His work on private commissions fared better.

He found time to study Greek and Latin, and also wrote several essays on art: Denis Diderot confided to him the chapter on &quot;Sculpture&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, released separately by Falconet as &quot;Réflexions sur la sculpture&quot; in 1768. Three years later, he published &quot;Observations sur la statue de Marc-Aurèle&quot;, which may be interpreted as the artistic program for his statue of Peter the Great. Falconet&#x27;s writings on art, his &quot;Oeuvres littéraires&quot;, came to six volumes when they were first published, at Lausanne, in 1781–1782. His extensive correspondence with Diderot, where he argued that the artist works out of inner necessity rather than for future fame, and that with Empress Catherine the Great of Russia reveal a great deal about his work and his beliefs about art.

Falconet&#x27;s somewhat prettified and too easy charm incurred the criticism of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&#x27;s eleventh edition:
&quot;His artistic productions are characterized by the same defects as his writings, for though manifesting considerable cleverness and some power of imagination, they display in many cases a false and fantastic taste, the result, most probably, of an excessive striving after originality.&quot;

Hermann Göring stole Falconet&#x27;s &quot;Friendship of the Heart&quot; from the Rothschild collection at Paris for the art collection of his Carinhall hunting lodge.

In 2001/2002, when the Musée de Céramique at Sèvres mounted an exhibition of Falconet&#x27;s production for Sèvres, 1757–1766, its subtitle was &quot;l&#x27;art de plaire&quot; (&quot;the art of pleasing&quot;). 

==Family==
The painter Pierre-Étienne Falconet (1741–91) was his son. A draftsman and engraver, he provided illustrations to his father&#x27;s entry on &quot;Sculpture&quot; for the Diderot &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

<text>Faldstool (from the O.H. Ger. &quot;falden&quot; or &quot;falten&quot;, &quot;to fold,&quot; and &quot;stuol&quot;, Mod. Ger. &quot;Stuhl&quot;, &quot;stool&quot;; from the medieval Latin &quot;faldistolium&quot; derived, through the old form &quot;fauesteuil&quot;, from the Mod. Fr. &quot;fauteuil&quot;) is a portable folding chair, used by a bishop when not occupying the throne in his own cathedral, or when officiating in a cathedral or church other than his own; hence any movable folding stool used during divine service.

Whatever the origins, it is difficult not to note the general resemblance to the curule chair or sella curulis, which according to Livy supposedly derived its name from &quot;currus&quot;, &quot;chariot&quot;, and like the Roman toga originated in Etruria, but much earlier stools supported on a cross-frame are known from the New Kingdom of Egypt.

Just as a campstool of similar form came to be used by military commanders in the field, so it became the ceremonial chair that accompanied the bishop in his official visitations. The bishop will either use the faldstool as a seat, or kneel in front of it, resting his forearms on it in prayer like a prie-dieu, depending upon the rubrical requirements. Other prelates may be granted the use of a faldstool during services, with certain limitations. The faldstool may be covered with silk cloth in red, green or violet, depending upon the liturgical season or the rank of the prelate.

In the Anglican Church, a faldstool is a desk at which a litany is recited. It also refers to the small, upholstered prie-dieu at which the British sovereign and the royal consort kneel during important religious services such as coronations and weddings.

The term &quot;faldistory&quot; has a similar meaning.

<text>The Dwight-Englewood School (D-E) is an independent coeducational college-preparatory day school, located in Englewood in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The school teaches students from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade in three functionally separate schools. The Lower School, formerly known as the Bede School, serves students in pre-kindergarten through 5th grade in Drapkin Hall. The Middle School, which used to be in Umpleby Hall, is now in the new middle school building which was finished in 2019, serves students in 6th through 8th grade. The Upper School serves grades 9 through 12, and it houses its administration in the Leggett building and the Campus Center. Other buildings are the Hajjar STEM Center, Swartley Arts Center, the Imperatore Library and the Modell Sports Complex.

As of the 2019–20 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,040 students (plus 28 in PreK) and 125.9 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 8.3:1. The school&#x27;s student body was 49.4% (514) White, 24.4% (254) Asian, 11.5% (120) Black, 9.0% (94) American Indian/ Alaska Native, 5.1% (53) Hispanic and 0.5% (5) Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander.

Dwight-Englewood is a member of the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools and has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1999.

==Awards, recognition and rankings==
Dwight-Englewood was awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive, during the 1986-87 school year.

== History ==
In 1889, the Dwight School for Girls was founded as a college preparatory school by Euphemia S. Creighton and Ellen W. Farrar. The name is chosen to honor then-president of Yale University, the Rev. Timothy Dwight V, whose educational philosophy they admired. The Englewood School for Boys was established in 1928 as a college preparatory school. In 1973, the two schools formed a nonprofit corporation known as Dwight-Englewood School. In 1993, Dwight-Englewood School and The Bede School merged to add students in Pre-K through sixth grade.

Middle School Building
A Middle School facility was built, replacing the Library Circle area of the campus and the now-demolished Generoso Pope Science Hall.

There are also plans for a multi-story auditorium to be built on campus to replace what is currently Umpleby Hall.

== Organization ==
Internally, the school has Principals for the lower, middle, and upper schools, as well as deans of students. The overall executive position which oversees all three schools is that of the Head of School. Within the schools, there are departments for Math, English, History, Science, Language, Physical Education, Technology, Human Development, and Arts. Each department has a department chair. Additionally, each grade in the middle and upper schools has a class dean who helps the students in their grade and manages certain grade-specific activities. Some class deans also teach various subjects at school aside from their role as class dean.

== Athletics ==
The Dwight-Englewood Bulldogs participate in the North Jersey Interscholastic Conference, which comprises small-enrollment schools in Bergen, Hudson County, Morris County and Passaic County counties, and was created following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). Prior to the realignment that took effect in the fall of 2010, Dwight-Englewood was a member of the Bergen County Scholastic League. With 388 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019–20 school year as Non-Public A for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 381 to 1,454 students in that grade range (equivalent to Group I for public schools). The school was classified by the NJSIAA as Non-Public Group III for football for 2018–2020. The school has many athletics programs, including boys&#x27; lacrosse, girls&#x27; lacrosse, boys&#x27; baseball, girls&#x27; softball, boys&#x27; football, coed golf, girls&#x27; field hockey, boys&#x27; basketball, girls&#x27; basketball, girls&#x27; volleyball, boys&#x27; tennis, girls&#x27; tennis, coed spring and winter track, coed cross country and coed ultimate frisbee.

The boys tennis team won the Non-Public B state championship in 1991 (defeating Moorestown Friends School in the final match of the tournament), 2008 (vs. Sacred Heart High School), 2010 (vs. Moorestown Friends), and won the Non-Public A state title in 2000 (vs. Christian Brothers Academy), 2002 (vs. St. Augustine Preparatory School). The boys&#x27; tennis team won the 2002 Non-Public B state championship and was the runner-up to Holmdel High School in the Tournament of Champions, falling by the score of 3-2 in the finals. In spring 2008, the boys&#x27; tennis team finished with a record of 21-1 and won the Bergen County Groups 1-2, North Jersey Group B Sectional, and Non-Public B state championship with a 5-0 win over Sacred Heart. The team&#x27;s only loss was in the Tournament of Champions semi-finals to ultimate runner-up Westfield High School by the score of 3-2. In 2010 the boys&#x27; team won the North Jersey Group B sectional, knocking off tournament favorite Newark Academy 3-2, and won the Group B title once again, against Moorestown Friends 4-1, before falling in the Tournament of Champions semifinal to Westfield, 3-1, t finish the season with a record of 26-4.

The ice hockey team won the McInnis Cup in 1994.

The wrestling team won the Non-Public Group B state championship in 1999.

The girls tennis team won the Non-Public A state championship in 2001 (vs. Red Bank Catholic High School). The girls&#x27; varsity tennis team won the Bergen County Small Schools title in 2010, finishing the season with a record of 18-1 and earning Courtney Baiardi Stasi recognition by &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; as its Coach of the Year for the season.

==Robotics teams==
The Dwight-Englewood Upper School robotics teams compete in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), an international robotics competition for students in grades 7-12. The Dwight-Englewood varsity robotics team, Critical Mass (FTC 207), was founded in 2005. D-E&#x27;s Junior Varsity and Freshman teams (FTC 13048 Absolute Zero and FTC 13663 Quantum Smashers, respectively) were founded in 2017.

The Varsity team has competed at state, regional, and international levels. In the 2014-2015 FTC season, Critical Mass competed at the East Super-Regional Championship Tournament, and in the 2016–17 season, the team won the Vermont FTC Championship and placed 13th in the Edison division at the FIRST Tech Challenge World Championship. In 2017–18 season, the team won the New Jersey FTC Championship and went on to place 18th in the Edison division at the world championship.

== The Fifth-Grade opera ==
In fifth grade, students compose and write an original opera. They form an opera company and go through all the steps necessary to stage a full production—script writing, libretto, costumes and makeup, set design, lighting, and publicity. This project is part of the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s program, &quot;Creating Original Opera.&quot; 2022 will be the 33rd year of opera production at the Lower School, as the 2020 Opera was unable to be completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Student government==
The Dwight-Englewood Student Government is divided into many initiatives. There are three groups of initiatives, which include a Curriculum, Facilities, and Life/Spirit Group. Within each group, there are multiple initiatives. Each initiative focuses on a certain issue such as workload or the Coop. There is also a President and a Vice-President, along with a Head for each Group and Initiative. There is also the position of Class Coordinator within each grade.

Before, the Student Government was divided into four Committees, Life, Spirit, Facilities, and Curriculum. The Student Life committee focused on things such as social events, and student privileges. The Spirit Committee concurrently worked with the life committee on social events, and they also hosted Spirit Week, Coffeehouse, and the MAGIC field day. The Facilities Committee addressed needs that include mending infrastructure around campus, and Maintenance Appreciation Day.

==Controversies==
===2021 allegations===
In May 2021, the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism (FAIR) sent a letter to the school criticizing their lessons on gender identity and race. FAIR said that lessons at the school taught students that teach young children that people are in danger because of whiteness, that racism is exclusively associated with whiteness, and say without qualification that white people have more opportunities than &quot;non-white&quot; people. FAIR also criticized lessons on gender identity and pronouns, claiming that they were age-inappropriate and that asking students to share their pronouns or use other schoolmate&#x27;s pronouns may violate their religious rights.

In June, FAIR started a campaign to support Dana Stangel-Plowe, who resigned from the Dwight-Englewood School due to what she called &quot;essentialist, racialist thinking&quot;. In her resignation letter, which was published by FAIR, she stated &quot;this year, administrators continue to assert D-E&#x27;s policy that we are hiring &#x27;for diversity,&#x27; D-E has become a workplace that is hostile toward educators based solely on their immutable traits.&quot;

===Head of School&#x27;s 2022 resignation===
On May 2, 2022, a little over a month before the end of the school year, the Dwight-Englewood community was informed that Head of School Dr. Rodney De Jarnett had resigned &quot;effectively immediately.&quot; In an email to parents and students, Board President Robert E. Miller stated, &quot;Dr. De Jarnett&#x27;s resignation follows conduct inconsistent with Dwight-Englewood School&#x27;s values and standards of behavior.&quot;

<text>Falerone is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Fermo, in the Italian region of the Marche, southeast of Urbisaglia.

The impressive remains of the ancient Roman city of &quot;Falerio Picenus&quot; lie about 2 km from Falerone in the village of Piane di Falerone.

==History==
&quot;Falerio Picenus&quot; was probably founded as a colony for his veterans by Augustus after his victory at Actium in 29 BC. This area of the river Tenna plain had been densely populated by the Piceni since the archaic age and the city became a centre of some importance in the region of Picenum.

A question arose in the time of Domitian between the inhabitants of &quot;Falerio&quot; and &quot;Firmum&quot; as to land which had been taken out of the territory of the latter (which was recolonized by the triumvirs), and, though not distributed to the new settlers, had not been given back again to the people of Firmum. The emperor, by a rescript, a copy of which in bronze was found at Falerio, decided in favor of the people of Falerio, that the occupiers of this land should remain in possession of it.

In the Late Antiquity the city decayed, and in the Middle Ages it followed the history of the local lordships.

==The city==

The economic and strategic importance of the area derived from the proximity of the Tenna river and the junction of the road coming from Fermo: one branch went along the river to Ascoli, the other towards Urbs Salvia.
The city had an orthogonal (Hippodamian) street plan centred around the two orthogonal axes: the &quot;cardo&quot;, in a north-south direction coinciding with the current Via del Pozzo, and the &quot;decumanus&quot; which connected the theatre to the amphitheatre from east to west. From these two main streets the secondary ones branched off, which constituted the structure of the urban settlement. The city&#x27;s perimeter stretched for about two miles.

==Main sights==


Considerable remains of the theatre with a capacity of around 1600 seats were excavated in 1838 and are still visible. Of the monumental construction, attributable to the Augustan age although completed under Tiberius and subsequently renovated several times, the first two levels of the cavea, the orchestra, the two side entrances, the proscenium and remains of the stage apparatus can still be admired. The cavea has a diameter of about 50 m and the third level was built on a vaulted gallery fronted by an arched façade of which numerous bases remain with semi-columns once covered with marble. The proscenium that delimits the orchestra is also well preserved with a structure of semicircular niches also decorated with marble. When the theatre was first excavated in 1777 with the sole purpose of enriching the Pope Pius Clementinus museum in Rome, the walls were still covered with coloured marbles and bronze fittings. From the theatre came two statues of Ceres and two more are in the Louvre. Its prestigious status in the city is shown by its embellishment with the statues donated by Antonia Picentina, priestess of Diva Faustina (wife of emperor Antoninus Pius) towards the middle of the second century AD.

The amphitheatre dates to the first century AD and held 6000 spectators. Its elliptical plan with the major east-west axis 120 m long, while the smaller one was about 105. It probably had twelve access doors, four of which gave directly into the arena, while the other eight gave access to the podium and seats which were divided into three different orders.

Between the two is a water reservoir (called &quot;Bagno della Regina&quot;) connected with remains of baths.

==Finds==

Part of the De Minicis collection that remained in Falerone was transferred to the Town Hall in 1928 together with other finds donated by private individuals. The collection, in a completely renovated and expanded layout in recent years, was later housed in two wings of the former Convent of San Francesco.

The museum includes important finds including three large statues: two female twins from the Antonine age and one in a toga. There is also a male statue of Hellenistic tradition, a marble torso of a youthful deity, perhaps an Eros, and a female head. The main finds also include a headless herm of Heracles and a small torso of a male deity.

The epigraphic section is important, with a rich collection of inscriptions. Among which the most important are a dedication to Octavia of the Augustan age and another to the Goddess Cupra. Part of the section is a bronze tablet with the transcription of Domitian&#x27;s rescript of 82 AD which deals with the dispute between the Faleronese and Fermani on the border territories.

Numerous finds from Falerio Picenus are also exhibited in important Italian and foreign museums. In the National Archaeological Museum of the Marche in Ancona there are a mosaic and other architectural elements, while in the Louvre in Paris there are a Perseus and a Nike. A precious mosaic floor is exhibited in the Vatican Museums, while in nearby Fermo a head of the emperor Augustus and a bronze steelyard are visible.

<text>Faliero (), also encountered in the variants Faleiro, Faledro or Faletro, was the name of a Venetian patrician family. 

==History==
The family was one of the oldest in Venice, its history being lost in the myths surrounding the city&#x27;s foundation at the end of Late Antiquity. According to the not very reliable 13th-century &quot;Chronicon Altinate&quot;, the family originally was called Anafesti, and haled from Fano, before moving to Padua and thence to Jesolo in the Venetian Lagoon as a result of Padua&#x27;s fall to the Lombards. Other sources try to connect the Falieri with the Ordelaffi from Forli, and suggest a Lombard origin, but this is mostly speculation on the basis of the similarity of their names (Ordelaf being the anagram of Faledro).

When the seat of Venice was moved from Eraclea to the Rialto in the early 9th century, they were among the fifty or so tribunician families to move there. The first member of the family is attested in a public act of April 912, where a certain Orso Faletro Dodono acted as witness. It appears that the family was numerous and may have been divided into three branches, the Anafesti, Ordelaffi, and Dodoni.

It was one of the most centrally connected of Venetian families. Four members were among the first colonists of Venetian Crete. Their descendants took the Greek name Phalieros (Φαλιέρος).

==Members==
The family produced three Doges of Venice:
*Vitale Faliero, Doge of Venice from 1084 until 1096
*Ordelafo Faliero, Doge of Venice from 1102 until 1117, married to Matelda Faliero
*Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice from 1354 until 1355, executed for the Faliero coup, married to Alucia Falier

Other famous members include:
*, bishop of Castello (1120–1133)
* ( 1152–1172), diplomat
*, patriarch of Grado (1201–1207)
*, Latin patriarch of Constantinople (1302–1305)
* (died 1474), writer
*Domenico Falier (1492–1564)
* (16th century), medallist
*Luca Falier (1545–1614)
*Francesco Falier (1557–1614)
*Giovanni Falier (1637–1681)

<text>Thunderclap Newman was a British rock band that Pete Townshend of the Who and Kit Lambert formed in 1969 in a bid to showcase the talents of John &quot;Speedy&quot; Keen, Jimmy McCulloch, and Andy &quot;Thunderclap&quot; Newman.

Their single, &quot;Something in the Air&quot;, a 1969 UK number one hit, remains in demand for television commercials, film soundtracks and compilations. The band released a critically acclaimed rock album, &quot;Hollywood Dream&quot;, and three other singles from the album, &quot;Accidents&quot;, &quot;The Reason&quot; and &quot;Wild Country&quot;.

From 1969 until 1971, the nucleus of the band consisted of the songwriter John &quot;Speedy&quot; Keen (vocals, drums, guitar), Andy &quot;Thunderclap&quot; Newman (piano) and Jimmy McCulloch (guitar). Pete Townshend (using the alias &quot;Bijou Drains&quot;) played bass guitar on their album and singles, all of which he had recorded and produced at the IBC Studio and his Twickenham home studio. The band augmented its personnel during its tours: in 1969 with James &quot;Jim&quot; Pitman-Avery (bass guitar) and Jack McCulloch (drums). The band folded in April 1971. 

In 2010, at the instigation of music business manager Ian Grant, Newman formed a new line-up with Mark Brzezicki, Nick Johnson, Josh Townshend and Tony Stubbings, who released an album titled &quot;Beyond Hollywood&quot; and remained active until 2012.

==Career==
In 1969, Townshend created the band to showcase songs written by the former Who chauffeur, drummer, singer and guitarist Keen. The opening track on &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; album, &quot;Armenia City in the Sky&quot;, was written by Keen. Newman, McCulloch and Keen met each other for the first time in December 1968 or January 1969, at Townshend&#x27;s home studio, to record &quot;Something in the Air&quot;. Townshend produced the single, played its bass guitar under the pseudonym Bijou Drains, and hired GPO engineer and Dixieland jazz pianist &quot;Thunderclap&quot; Newman (born Andrew Laurence Newman, 21 November 1942, Hounslow, Middlesex, died 29 March 2016) and the fifteen-year-old Glaswegian guitarist Jimmy McCulloch. Before then, Townshend had planned to work on projects for each of the musicians, but Kit Lambert prevailed upon Townshend, who was working on what became the rock-opera &quot;Tommy&quot;, to save time by coalescing the three musicians into the collective project that became Thunderclap Newman.

&quot;Something in the Air&quot;, which Keen wrote, was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks, replacing the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; and holding off Elvis Presley. Originally it was titled &quot;Revolution&quot;, but later renamed because the Beatles had released a song of that name in 1968, the B-side of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. By December 1969, the single had been awarded a gold disc for worldwide sales of more than a million.

&quot;Something in the Air&quot; appeared on the soundtracks of the films &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Strawberry Statement&quot; (1970), the latter having helped the single reach number 25 in the United States. In the UK and US, a follow-up single, &quot;Accidents&quot;, came out in May 1970 and charted at number 44 for only a week, but did not chart at all in the US. &quot;Something in the Air&quot; was also in the film &quot;Kingpin&quot; (1996) and is used on the soundtrack. It was also used in &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000) and is on the soundtrack.

Thunderclap Newman had not planned to undertake live performances, but the band relented when, to their collective surprise, &quot;Something in the Air&quot; became a chart success. The trio, augmented by Jim Pitman-Avery (bass guitar) and McCulloch&#x27;s elder brother Jack (drums), undertook a 26-date tour of England and Scotland, in support of Deep Purple, from July 1969 to August 1969. On 8 August, Pitman-Avery and McCulloch announced their intention to leave the band. Within weeks, they had formed the country-rock band Wild Country with Terry Keyworth (guitar) and Stuart Whitcombe (keyboards). That year, the band appeared in television programmes in Britain (&quot;How Late It Is&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;) and Germany (&quot;Beat-Club&quot;).

In October 1970, Thunderclap Newman released its critically acclaimed album, &quot;Hollywood Dream&quot;. Produced by Townshend, the album peaked at number 163 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. That year, they released three singles: &quot;Accidents/I See It All&quot;, &quot;The Reason/Stormy Petrel&quot; and &quot;Wild Country/Hollywood Dream&quot;. On 7 November, they appeared on &quot;Ev&quot; (also known as &quot;The Kenny Everett Show&quot;). In early 1971, the founding trio reformed with the Australian musicians Roger Felice (drums) and Ronnie Peel (bass guitar).

On 6 March 1971, &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) reported the band&#x27;s personnel change: 
With its new line-up, Thunderclap Newman supported Deep Purple from January 1971 to April 1971, during a 19-date tour of England and Scotland. At some time during those months, the band supported Leon Russell during a tour of the Netherlands and supported Deep Purple during a tour of Scandinavia. They played the club circuit and avoided playing in ballrooms. That year, Thunderclap Newman made a cameo appearance in the British movie &quot;Not Tonight, Darling&quot; (1971).

Thunderclap Newman broke up around 10 April 1971, days before they were scheduled to start a tour of Scotland, and weeks before they were scheduled to be part of a package tour with Marsha Hunt and others during the Who&#x27;s 12-week tour of the US.

The members of the band had little in common. In a 1972 &quot;NME&quot; interview, Newman said that he got on with Keen&#x27;s music but not with Keen personally, while the exact opposite was true with regard to McCulloch.

In 2008, Newman appeared on an episode of the British television programme &quot;Those Were The Days&quot; to comment upon the night of the first Moon landing, when Thunderclap Newman had performed an almost-night-long concert.

==Separate ways==
McCulloch had stints with a dozen or more bands, including John Mayall, Stone the Crows, and Paul McCartney&#x27;s Wings but, on 25 September 1979, at the age of 26, he died in his home from a cardiac arrest. His body was discovered by his brother, Jack, two days later.

In 1973, Keen released a solo album for Track, entitled &quot;Previous Convictions&quot;, which featured McCulloch and Roger Felice on some tracks. He began recording a double album as a follow-up. Frustrated by his lack of progress at Track, he took the demos to Island Records, which pared it down to the single album &quot;Y&#x27;know Wot I Mean?&quot; and released it in 1975. Its single, &quot;Someone to Love&quot;, received significant airplay but failed to chart.

Discouraged, Keen ceased recording after one more single in 1976. He tried his hand at record producing, working with the punk band Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers on their first album &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot; in 1977, and also produced Motörhead&#x27;s first album before leaving the music industry.

Keen suffered from arthritis for several years, and was recording his third solo album, when he unexpectedly died of heart failure on 12 March 2002, at the age of 56.

In 1971, Newman recorded a solo album, &quot;Rainbow&quot;, and played assorted instruments on Roger Ruskin Spear&#x27;s first album.

In 2002, Newman was eventually coaxed out of retirement by István Etiam and David Buckley (ex-Barracudas). Another three musicians were added to the line-up and in late 2005 the Thunderclap Newman Band was formed. It was an international collection of six musicians of various nationalities and with different musical backgrounds. Under the leadership of Andy Newman, the band set out to celebrate the music of Thunderclap Newman and to honour the legacy of John &quot;Speedy&quot; Keen and Jimmy McCulloch.

One of the aims of the band was to perform &quot;Hollywood Dream&quot; for the first time ever in its entirety, alongside material written by Keen and McCulloch after Thunderclap Newman had gone their separate ways. With two more songwriters, David Buckley and István Etiam, there were plans to add new songs to the existing material.

Despite good press reviews and numerous successful performances, disagreements within the band started to emerge. Andy Newman accepted an offer from Big Country&#x27;s manager, Ian Grant, to assemble a new band around him and, in March 2010, the Thunderclap Newman Band was disbanded.

The Thunderclap Newman Band was: Andy &#x27;Thunderclap&#x27; Newman (UK) – keyboards, soprano sax, clarinet, oboe, David Buckley (US) – vocals, guitar, István Etiam (HU) – rhythm guitar, lap-steel guitar, harmonica &amp; vocals, Stefanos Tsourelis (GR) – lead guitar, Brian Jackson (UK) – bass guitar, Antonio Spano (I) – drums.

In February 2010, Newman performed as Thunderclap Newman at the Con Club in Lewes, Sussex, with a new line-up: Tony Stubbings (bass guitar), Nick Johnson (lead guitar), Mark Brzezicki (former Big Country, drums) and Josh Townshend (nephew of Pete Townshend, on rhythm guitar and vocals). Soon thereafter, the band released a CD entitled &quot;Beyond Hollywood&quot;, a live album with three studio re-rerecordings of Thunderclap Newman songs.

Thunderclap Newman supported Big Country on a 2011 tour of the UK. The band played 15 concerts between 2010 and 2012, the last one in June 2012 at the Isle of Wight festival. That was the last one ever, and after that the band stopped performing.

Andy &quot;Thunderclap&quot; Newman died on 29 March 2016, at the age of 73.

<text>Paul Ludwig Adalbert Falk (10 August 18277 July 1900) was a German politician.

Falk was born in Metschkau (Mieczków), Silesia. In 1847, he entered the Prussian state service, and in 1853, he became public prosecutor at Lyck (now Ełk). In 1858, he was elected a deputy and joined the Old Liberal Party. In 1868, he became a privy councillor in the ministry of justice.

In 1872, he was made minister of education and, in connection with Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s policy of the Kulturkampf, was responsible for the Falk Laws, or May Laws, against the Roman Catholic Church. In 1879, with his position becoming untenable because of the death of Pope Pius IX and the change of German policy with regard to the Vatican, he resigned his office but retained his seat in the Reichstag until 1882.

He was then made president of the supreme court of justice at Hamm, where he died in 1900.

<text>Javier Manuel &quot;Jay&quot; Hernandez (born February 20, 1978) is an American actor. After making his television debut in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Hang Time&quot;, he made his film debut opposite Kirsten Dunst in the romantic drama &quot;Crazy/Beautiful&quot; (2001). He has since starred in numerous films, including &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (2004), &quot;Hostel&quot; (2005), &quot;Bad Moms&quot; (2016), and as Chato Santana / El Diablo in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016). From 2018 until 2024, he played Thomas Magnum in the reboot of &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;

==Early life==
Hernandez was born on February 20, 1978, in Montebello, California, the son of Isis (&quot;née&quot; Maldonado), a secretary and accountant, and Javier Hernandez Sr., a mechanic. He has a younger sister, Amelia, and two older brothers, Michael and Gabriel. He attended Don Bosco Technical Institute in Rosemead, California, but transferred to Schurr High School in Montebello for his senior year. While riding an elevator in a high-rise in Los Angeles, he was approached by talent manager Howard Tyner who suggested he had what it took to have a successful career in Hollywood. He enrolled Hernandez into acting school and sent his pictures to casting agents. He is first generation Mexican-American; his parents are immigrants from Michoacán, Mexico.

==Career==
From 1998 to 2000, Hernandez played Antonio Lopez on the NBC series &quot;Hang Time&quot;. His name break came with his role opposite Kirsten Dunst in the 2001 Touchstone Pictures feature &quot;Crazy/Beautiful&quot;. He has since appeared in several major Hollywood films, including lead roles in &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way: Rise to Power&quot;, the 2005 horror film &quot;Hostel&quot; and &quot;World Trade Center&quot;. He appeared in the action/crime film &quot;Takers&quot; (2010).

He appeared in the 2005 crime prequel &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way: Rise to Power as&quot; Carlito Brigante, the role originated by Al Pacino in the &quot;1993 film of the same name&quot;.

Hernandez portrayed Paxton in Eli Roth&#x27;s &quot;Hostel&quot; (2005) and its 2007 sequel, &quot;&quot;.

In 2015, he appeared in &quot;Max&quot; as a US military sergeant assigned with the titular rescue dog, which was traumatized by his previous handler&#x27;s death.

In 2016, he starred as Jessie Harkness in the comedy film &quot;Bad Moms&quot;, and as metahuman ex-gangster El Diablo in the superhero film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;.

On February 20, 2018, Hernandez was cast as Thomas Magnum in CBS drama series &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot; reboot. It premiered on September 24, 2018. After four seasons, it was canceled in May 2022, before being rescued by NBC with a two-season order that June.

==Personal life==
In 2006, Hernandez married his former &quot;Hang Time&quot; co-star Daniella Deutscher.

<text>Simon Frederick Marquis, 3rd Earl of Woolton (born 24 May 1958), styled Viscount Walberton between 1964 and 1969, is a British hereditary peer and businessman.

==Early life and education==
The only son of Roger Marquis, 2nd Earl of Woolton, and his second wife (Cecily) Josephine Gordon-Cumming (1925–2012), later Countess Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, elder daughter of Sir Alexander Penrose Gordon-Cumming, 5th Baronet. He succeeded to the earldom and subsidiary titles at the age of 10 upon the death of his father in 1969.

After attending Eton, he went up to read Economics and Modern History at the University of St Andrews, graduating MA in 1981.

==Career==
Lord Woolton was a director of New Boathouse Capital and Chief Financial Officer of Quayle Munro, Since 2012, he sits on the board of Quayle Munro Holdings Ltd.

Woolton was introduced to the House of Lords in 1979 (21 being the minimum age at which a peer can take his or her seat) where he sat until the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed hereditary peers&#x27; automatic right of a legislative seat.

A Freeman of the City of London, Lord Woolton serves as Master of the Worshipful Company of Skinners (for 2024/25).

==Marriages and children==
Woolton married the Hon. Sophie Birdwood, only child of Mark Birdwood, 3rd Baron Birdwood, in 1987. The Earl and Countess of Wollton had three daughters:

* Lady Olivia Alice Marquis (born 16 April 1990)
* Lady Constance Elizabeth Marquis (born 14 October 1991)
* Lady Claudia Louise Marquis (born 3 March 1995).

Lord Woolton and his first wife were divorced on 13 May 1997. He married secondly, on 28 October 1999, Mrs (Mary) Carol Chapman (&quot;née&quot; Davidson), who has two daughters from a previous marriage.

As Lord Woolton has no sons nor an heir, as there are no other surviving male-line descendants of the first earl. Thus the earldom and its subsidiary titles will become extinct upon the present earl&#x27;s death.

<text>The New York Tunnel Extension (also New York Improvement and Tunnel Extension) is a combination of railroad tunnels and approaches from New Jersey and Long Island to Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan.

It was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) at the beginning of the 20th century to improve railroad access throughout the greater New York City area, and led to the line&#x27;s then-new passenger facility, Pennsylvania Station.

==Planning==
The PRR had consolidated its control of railroads in New Jersey with the lease of United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company in 1871, thereby extending its rail network from Philadelphia northward to Jersey City. Crossing the Hudson River, however, remained a major obstacle. To the east, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) ended at the East River. In both situations, passengers had to transfer to ferries to Manhattan. This put the PRR at a disadvantage relative to its closest competitor, the New York Central Railroad, which already served Manhattan via its Grand Central Station.

===Early tunnel and bridge proposals===
Various plans to build a physical link across the Hudson River were discussed as early as the 1870s, and both tunnel and bridge projects were considered by the railroads and government officials. A tunnel project for the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&amp;M), a rapid transit line, began in 1874, and encountered serious engineering, financial and legal obstacles. The project was halted in 1880 after a blowout accident that cost 20 lives. (Work on the H&amp;M tunneling project, later known as the Uptown Hudson Tubes, continued intermittently but was not completed until 1906; it was opened to passenger trains in 1908.)

The technology of tunnel-building was still primitive and risky in the 1880s, and this gave impetus to a major bridge design proposal promoted by engineer Gustav Lindenthal. The bridge would be situated between Hoboken, New Jersey and 23rd Street in Manhattan. However, due to the congested shipping conditions in New York Harbor, the design called for an enormous bridge span that would have been twice that of the Brooklyn Bridge. At one point, plans for the bridge called for it to carry 14 tracks. Although Congress granted Lindenthal&#x27;s company a charter in 1890 for construction of a bridge, the huge $27 million project cost would have to be shared by several railroads. The Panic of 1893 made large capital investments nearly impossible for some time, as one third of the nation&#x27;s railroads failed. Some foundation masonry was laid on the Hoboken side in 1895, but the PRR was unsuccessful in getting other companies to share in the expenses, and the bridge project was abandoned.

===Revised plans===
The PRR, working with the LIRR, developed several new proposals for improved regional rail access in 1892. They included construction of new tunnels between Jersey City and Manhattan, and possibly a tunnel via Brooklyn and the East River; new terminals in midtown Manhattan for both the PRR and LIRR; completion of the Hudson Tubes; and a bridge proposal. These ideas were discussed extensively for several years but did not come to fruition until the turn of the century. In 1901 the PRR took great interest in a new railroad approach just completed in Paris. In the Parisian railroad scheme, electric locomotives were substituted for steam locomotives prior to the final approach into the city. PRR President Alexander Johnston Cassatt, upon his return from Paris, adapted the method for the New York City area in the form of the New York Tunnel Extension project, which he created and led the overall planning effort for. The PRR, who had been working with the LIRR on the Tunnel Extension plans, made plans to acquire majority control of the LIRR so that one new terminal, rather than two, could be built in Manhattan. The PRR acquired the LIRR in 1900. A board was created to study each of the proposals to bring the PRR directly into New York. The team ultimately found that a direct approach was better than any of the alternatives.

The original proposal for the PRR and LIRR terminal in Midtown, which was published in June 1901, called for the construction of a bridge across Hudson River between 45th and 50th Streets in Manhattan, as well as two closely spaced terminals for the LIRR and PRR. This would allow passengers to travel between Long Island and New Jersey without having to switch trains. In December 1901, the plans were modified so that the PRR would construct the North River Tunnels under the Hudson River, instead of a bridge over it. The PRR cited costs and land value as a reason for constructing a tunnel rather than a bridge, since the cost of a tunnel would be one-third that of a bridge. The North River Tunnels themselves would consist of between two and four steel tubes with the diameter of . The New York Tunnel Extension quickly gained opposition from the New York City Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners, who objected that they would not have jurisdiction over the new tunnels, as well as from the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which saw the New York Tunnel Extension as a potential competitor to its as-yet-incomplete rapid transit service. The project was approved by the New York City Board of Aldermen in December 1902, on a 41-36 vote. The North and East River Tunnels were to be built under the riverbed of their respective rivers. The PRR and LIRR lines would converge at New York Penn Station, an expansive Beaux-Arts edifice between 31st and 33rd Streets in Manhattan. The entire project was expected to cost over $100 million.

The PRR created subsidiaries to manage the project. The Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York Railroad and the Pennsylvania, New York and Long Island Rail Road, were the New Jersey and New York parts, respectively. The PNJ&amp;NY was incorporated February 13, 1902, and the PNY&amp;LI was incorporated April 21, 1902. They were consolidated into the Pennsylvania Tunnel and Terminal Railroad (PT&amp;T) on June 26, 1907.

==Design and construction==
The design and construction aspects of the project were organized into three principal divisions: the Meadows, North River, and East River divisions. As of 2021, there are revived plans to renovate and expand the Meadows and North River divisions as part of the Gateway Program.

===Meadows Division===
The original PRR route in New Jersey ran to the Exchange Place ferry terminal in Jersey City. The Meadows Division project built a new, approximately route from the PRR main line at Harrison, New Jersey, northeast to the west end of the new tunnels. This involved constructing a new station at Harrison, Manhattan Transfer, along with a rail yard, to provide for changing between steam and electric locomotives. Northeast from this new station the double track line was built. It crossed over the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad on the Sawtooth Bridges; the Hackensack River on the Portal Bridge; and on embankment through the Hackensack Meadowlands to the west portal of the tunnels under Bergen Hill in the Palisades.

===North River Division===
The North River Division ran from the west portal of the tunnels to Manhattan. The PRR ultimately decided to build a pair of single-track tunnels under the river, called the North River Tunnels, between Weehawken and midtown Manhattan; the two tunnels continued seamlessly west from Weehawken to the west portals. In later years &quot;North River Tunnels&quot; came to refer to the whole length of tunnel from the western portal in North Bergen to 10th Avenue in Manhattan. The two tracks fan out to 21 tracks just west of Penn Station.

Construction on the North River tunnels began in 1904 under the supervision of O&#x27;Rourke Engineering and Construction Company. Boring operations were completed on October 9, 1906. Service from New Jersey to Manhattan began on November 27, 1910, once Penn Station was completed.

===East River Division===
The East River Division managed construction of tunnels running across Manhattan, and under the East River to Queens. The East River Tunnels are four single-track tunnels that extend from the eastern end of Pennsylvania Station and cross the East River. East of the station, tracks 5–21 merge into two 3-track tunnels, which then merge into the East River Tunnels&#x27; four tracks. The tunnels end and the tracks rise to ground level east of the Queens shoreline. The tunnels connect to Sunnyside Yard, a large coach yard that could hold up to 1,550 train carriages. Construction proceeded concurrently with the North River tunnels.

The tunnels were built by S. Pearson and Son, the same company who had built the Uptown Hudson Tubes. The tunnel technology was so innovative that in 1907 the PRR shipped an actual diameter section of the new East River Tunnels to the Jamestown Exposition in Norfolk, Virginia, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the nearby founding of the colony at Jamestown. The same tube, with an inscription indicating that it had been displayed at the Exposition, was later installed under water and remains in use. Construction was completed on the East River tunnels on March 18, 1908. LIRR service to Penn Station began on September 8, 1910.

==Operation during the PRR era==
By the time construction was complete, the total project cost for the station and associated tunnels was $114 million (equivalent to $ billion in ), according to an Interstate Commerce Commission report.

The North River Tunnels carried PRR trains under the Hudson; for some years PRR electric engines also pulled Lehigh Valley Railroad or Baltimore and Ohio Railroad trains to New York. The East River Tunnels carried LIRR and PRR trains to the Sunnyside Yard in Queens. As part of the New York Connecting Railroad improvement project, a connection from the East River Tunnels to the New Haven Railroad tracks was also built. New Haven trains began running through the East River Tunnels, serving Penn Station, in 1917 after the Hell Gate Bridge opened.

The electrification of the New York Tunnel Extension, including the station, was initially 600-volt direct-current third rail. It was later changed to 11,000V alternating-current overhead catenary when electrification of PRR&#x27;s mainline was extended to Washington, D.C., in the early 1930s. In New Jersey the third rail ended at Manhattan Transfer, where all trains stopped to change steam and electric engines. Two electrical substations were built for the project: one in Harrison, New Jersey, and the other in Long Island City, New York.

After the New York Tunnel Extension opened, some PRR suburban trains continued to serve the Exchange Place station, where passengers could board the PRR ferry, or the Hudson Tube system (later called PATH), to downtown Manhattan. The ferry from Exchange Place ended service in 1949, and the Exchange Place PRR terminal closed in 1961.

One branch, the freight-only Harrison Branch, split off the line just east of its west end and ran west to a connection with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad&#x27;s Harrison Cut-off and the Erie Railroad&#x27;s Paterson and Newark Branch.

===Trackage rights===
The following non-PRR railroads used the line:

*Baltimore and Ohio Railroad during World War I
*Lehigh Valley Railroad
*New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad

==Operation by successor railroads==
The PRR merged into Penn Central Transportation in 1968. All of Penn Central&#x27;s property was conveyed to Amtrak on April 1, 1976, when Conrail&#x27;s system was formed. The Tunnel Extension is now part of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor; New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road use the western and eastern sections, respectively, to reach New York Penn Station.

<text>Bruce Norman Atkinson (born 15 May 1953) is a former Australian politician. He was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council since October 1992, representing Koonung Province from 1992 to 2006 and Eastern Metropolitan Region from 2006 to 2022. He was the President of the Legislative Council from 2010 to 2018.

==Personal affairs==
Atkinson was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and attended Mitcham High School. He undertook a cadetship with the Leader group of newspapers after graduating, and worked as a journalist for a period. However, he soon made a move into the business world, first into small business, and later into several more prominent operations, including a stint managing a shopping centre. He has also been a writer for the Foodweek and Inside Retailing publications since 1981, and operates his own business consultancy firm, The Atkinson Group.

==Political career==

=== Local Politics ===
He was elected to the Nunawading city council in 1975, and served as a councillor there for 17 years. This included two terms as mayor in 1981–1982 and 1990–1991.

=== State Politics ===
In the lead-up to the 1992 state election, Atkinson won Liberal Party pre-selection for the moderately safe upper house seat of Koonung Province. He was elected, and served on the Family and Community Development Committee from 1992 to 1996. In 1996, he was promoted to ministry in the Kennett Government, as Parliamentary Secretary for Planning and Local Government.

Atkinson subsequently spent four years on the backbenches, during which time he did not serve on any committees. After a significant loss of the shadow ministry following the Liberal Party&#x27;s defeat at the 2002 state election, Atkinson was appointed as the party&#x27;s spokesperson for small business. He was also appointed to serve on the Housing and Economic Development Committees, and was Deputy Chair of the latter.

In January 2004 he was appointed spokesman for sport and recreation. In December 2006 he was elected Deputy President of the Legislative Council and relinquished his shadow ministry positions. In 2009 he was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Business Development. Following the Coalition&#x27;s victory in the 2010 state elections, Atkinson was elected President of Victoria&#x27;s Legislative Council.

Atkinson was reappointed to the role of Legislative Council President in December 2014, defeating Labor nominee Gayle Tierney. In 2019, media reported that Atkinson was an honorary member of a foreign influence organization known as the World Trade United Foundation, which has ties to the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party. In response, Atkinson claimed that he derived no financial benefit from the organization and that his title was solely honorific in nature. In May 2019, Atkinson became vice chairman of a water technology company that is linked to World Trade United Foundation.

On 9 June 2022, Atkinson announced that he would not be contesting the 2022 Victorian state election.

<doc id="1305528" wikidata="Q318646" url="?curid=1305528" title="Shenzhou 7">
<text>Shenzhou 7 () was the third human spaceflight mission of the Chinese space program. The mission, which included the first Chinese extra-vehicular activity (EVA) carried out by crew members Zhai Zhigang and Liu Boming, marked the commencement of the second phase of the Chinese government&#x27;s Project 921.

The Shenzhou spacecraft carrying the three crew members was launched 25 September 2008, by a Long March 2F (CZ-2F) rocket which lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center at 21:10 CST. The mission lasted three days, after which the craft landed safely in Siziwang Banner in central Inner Mongolia on 28 September 2008, at 17:37 CST. The Shenzhou 7 EVA made the Chinese space program the third to have conducted an EVA. EVAs had previously been conducted by the space programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia) and the United States.

== Crew ==
The crew for Shenzhou 7 was announced on 17 September 2008.
=== Backup crew ===
Of the back-up crew, only Chen Quan had not previously flown in space.

== Mission highlights ==

Shenzhou 7 was the first Chinese space mission to carry a three-person crew for several days and conduct a full operation. A total of six astronauts were trained, three to conduct the mission and three others to serve as a backup crew.

The Long March 2F rocket launched the Shenzhou 7 into an initial elliptical orbit of 200 x 330 kilometres inclined at 42.4 degrees on 25 September 2008. About seven hours later the spacecraft raised its orbit to a more circular orbit of 330 x 336 km. After three days in space, deorbit manoeuvres began on 28 September at 08:48, and the return module landed at 09:37 UTC at coordinates .

China has been congratulated by a number of foreign leaders for the successful completion of the mission, which marked a number of developments for China&#x27;s space program, including several first-time achievements.

The Shenzhou 7 Mission won the 2009 Space Achievement Award from the &quot;Space Foundation&quot;.

=== Spacewalk ===
On 27 September, Zhai Zhigang, wearing a Chinese-developed Feitian space suit, conducted a 22-minute space walk, the first ever for a Chinese astronaut. Zhai slipped out of the orbital module in a head-first position at around 16:43 (0843 GMT) and wandered around the orbital module, retrieved experiment samples and waved the Chinese flag in space. The spacewalk lasted about 20 minutes, with Zhai returning to the orbital module at 17:00. The first space walk was limited in scope: cables were used to tie Zhai to the handrail outside the orbital module, and his moving route was restricted to areas near the exits. Liu Boming, wearing a Russian Orlan-M suit, stayed in the airlock in the orbital module to provide help if necessary. Liu also conducted an EVA, standing up at 08:58 UTC to hand Zhai a flag. The third astronaut, Jing Haipeng remained in the re-entry module to monitor the general situation of the spacecraft. By 09:00 UTC both astronauts were back inside and the hatch was closed. The space walk was broadcast live on Chinese media, and two cameras provided panoramic images.

The Feitian spacesuit is similar to the Orlan-M (known as &quot;Haiying&quot;, 海鹰, in Chinese) in shape and volume and are designed for spacewalks of up to seven hours, providing oxygen and allowing for the excretion of bodily waste. According to Chinese media reports, spacesuit materials with such features as fire and radiation resistance were developed by several civilian corporations and national institutes. Each suit was reported to have cost 30 million RMB (about US$4.4 million). Except for the gloves of the Feitian suit, the space suits were not brought back to Earth.

A fire alarm was reported to the control center at the beginning of the EVA, but it was confirmed to be a false alarm.

=== Solid lubricant experiment ===

Scientists conducted a solid lubricant exposure experiment during the mission. A piece of equipment the size of a book was installed on the outside wall of the orbital module, and was later retrieved during the space walk, after having been exposed in space for more than 40 hours. The experiment was aimed to study a lubricant which will be used for space-based moving components in future space facilities.

=== Release of miniaturized satellite ===

A miniaturized satellite was released during the mission on 27 September at 19:24, after Zhai returned to the spacecraft. The satellite was a cube about long, with a mass of ; it carried boost devices and two 150-megapixel stereo cameras. The satellite&#x27;s tasks included testing the mini-satellite technology, observing and monitoring the spacecraft, and testing the tracking and approaching technology used for space rendezvous and docking.

The miniaturized satellite took photos and videos near the spacecraft, then maneuvered to about away from the spacecraft. After the return module separated from the spacecraft and re-entered the atmosphere, the satellite caught up to the orbiting spacecraft using a liquid ammonia engine, then continue to orbit around the spacecraft. The mini-satellite will work for about three months.

=== Data relay satellite ===

China launched its first data relay satellite, called &quot;Tianlian I&quot; (天链一号), from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center on a Long March-3C carrier rocket on 25 April 2008. The Tianlian I satellite will be used to speed up communication between the Shenzhou 7 spacecraft and the ground stations, and to increase the amount of data that can be transferred to the ground. The Tianlian I satellite alone can cover 50 percent of the orbit of Shenzhou 7—whereas the Yuanwang space tracking ships, along with China&#x27;s ten ground observation stations, have a coverage of only 12 percent—and thus will increase the total coverage to about 62 percent of the mission.

== Mission support and preparation ==
=== Subsystems ===
The Shenzhou 7 project consists of seven subsystems, with the Chinese military responsible for launching, recovering, crew, and tracking subsystems, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation responsible for the carrier rocket and spacecraft itself, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences responsible for the payloads on board the spacecraft (other than the crew).

=== Water training pool ===
A columniform water training pool of in diameter and in depth, located in China Astronaut Training Center, simulates the weightlessness experienced in space. A model of the Shenzhou orbital module has been used in the pool to train the crew for the space walk.

=== Modifications to the CZ-2F carrier rocket ===

Special attention has been paid to solving vibration problems that were encountered 120 seconds into the Shenzhou 5 mission. These vibrations were described by Shenzhou 5 astronaut Yang Liwei as hard to endure. Corrective measures were implemented for the Shenzhou 6 mission, but since then more improvements have been added to the carrier rocket, to the pipes of the second stage, and to more than thirty other parts of the spacecraft..

=== Modifications to the spacecraft ===

The Orbital module has been modified and its solar panels removed in order to allow for the EVA experiment. For this same reason, in contrast to previous Shenzhou missions, it will not remain in space after its separation with the departing crew in the Return module. Handrails have been added to the external wall of the Orbital module to allow the space walking astronaut to reach specific experiment areas.

More cameras have been installed on this spacecraft than on the Shenzhou 6 vessel, in addition to those covering the Orbital module and the Return module.

=== New space tracking ships ===
Two new, recently commissioned Yuanwang-class tracking ships, Yuanwang-5 and Yuanwang-6, played a key role in the Shenzhou VII mission.

=== Toilets ===

Custom-made, compact, foldable toilets allow the astronaut&#x27;s collected urine to be scientifically inspected.

=== Project management ===
Most of the Shenzhou 6 project management team has stayed for the Shenzhou 7 mission. Changes in personnel include:
* General Project Manager and Commander Chen Bingde has been replaced, after his promotion to the position of Chief of the General Staff, by the current Director-General of the General Armaments Department, Chang Wanquan.
* First Vice General Project Manager and Commander Lieutenant General Hu Shixiang () has been replaced by the current Vice Director-General of the General Armaments Department, Lieutenant General Zhang Jianqi ()
* Vice General Project Manager and Commander Zhang Qingwei has been replaced after his promotion to head of the ACAC consortium, by Ma Xingrui, the head of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation
* Vice General Engineer of Shenzhou 6, Zhou Jianping () was promoted to General Engineer of Shenzhou 7, succeeding Wang Yongzhi.
* Director of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center: Major General Zhang Yulin () has been replaced, after his promotion to Chancellor of the National University of Defense Technology, by the Vice Director of Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center Major General Cui Jijun ()

== Controversy ==

According to the United States Strategic Command, at 15:07 Greenwich Mean Time on 27 September 2008, the Shenzhou 7 ship passed within 45 kilometers of the International Space Station. There is no international laws defining distance of passage of outer space objects. China did not respond to queries about why it allowed its ship to pass so close to the space station. Richard Fisher, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center, in an opinion piece in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; noted that the Shenzhou 7 had launched its companion satellite BX-1 four hours earlier. The IASC is a &quot;think-tank&quot; focused on medium and long-term security issues and their impact on the security of the United States and her key allies. He noted &quot;China&#x27;s track record of using all of its Shenzhou missions since 1999 for dual military-civil missions,&quot; and speculated that China may have used the opportunity to pass near the space station to test &quot;co-orbital&quot; antisatellite interception technology.

<doc id="1305534" wikidata="Q1042126" url="?curid=1305534" title="Kennedy station">
<text>Kennedy is a Toronto subway station system that is the eastern terminus of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. Opened in 1980, it is located east of the Kennedy Road and Eglinton Avenue intersection. With the adjacent Kennedy GO station on the Stouffville line of GO Transit, Kennedy is an intermodal transit hub and the fifth busiest station in the system, after , , , and , serving a total of approximately customer trips a day.

It was built as part of the extensions east to Kipling and west to this station. The station&#x27;s main complex consists of four floors with wheelchair accessible entrances. The ground level is the bus terminal surrounded with ten platforms that serve 16 Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus routes. Wi-Fi service is available at this station.

Kennedy station was previously the southern terminus of Line 3 Scarborough before it was permanently closed on July 24, 2023. The line was opened in 1985. The station&#x27;s bus terminal is being expanded to handle replacement buses.

Construction to expand the station began in 2017 to add a platform for the future Line 5 Eglinton, which will terminate at the station when its first phase opens.

==Station complex==

The station is located south of Eglinton Avenue, east of Kennedy Road. The station complex consists of four levels. Trains of the former Line 3 Scarborough previously ascended via a bridge to the platform located at the top level of the station complex. The ground floor (third floor, but labelled 2 in the elevator) consists of ten bus platforms surrounding the main building. Three satellite pedestrian entrances to the station can be found at the South Parking Lot, next to the Don Montgomery Community Centre, and the passenger pick-up and drop-off roundabout on Transway Crescent. (A fourth entrance, at the service road of Eglinton Avenue, was demolished in 2018 and no longer exists.) Below the ground level is the concourse that spans the length of the station, connecting to all pedestrian entrances. Below the concourse is the platform for subway trains on the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth.

Four park and ride lots, that had a combined total of 729 spaces, used to be located around the station. As of August 21, 2023, these lots no longer exist.

=== Line 2 Bloor–Danforth ===
Line 2 Bloor–Danforth was opened on February 25, 1966, and was extended westwards to Warden station on May 10, 1968, and to Kennedy station on November 21, 1980.

An extension of Line 2, called the Scarborough Subway Extension, is under construction that will make Kennedy a through-station. From Kennedy station, the three-stop, extension will travel east under Eglinton Avenue, then north under Danforth Road and McCowan Road to terminate at Sheppard Avenue.

=== Line 5 Eglinton ===
Kennedy is being expanded to become the eastern terminus of Line 5 Eglinton. The Line 5 station will be underground, south of Eglinton Avenue East, and about north of the Line 2 platforms.

The main entrance to Kennedy station at the southwest corner of West Service Road and Transway Crescent was demolished and has been replaced by a new entrance to access the Line 5 concourse to be located one level above the Line 5 platforms. Two elevators will connect the Line 5 concourse to the Line 5 platform. Two north–south passages will connect the Line 5 concourse to the existing Line 2 concourse. There will be few changes to the Line 2 concourse. A secondary entrance on the east side of the existing GO rail corridor serves as the main entrance to the GO station.

=== Line 3 Scarborough ===
In 1985, Kennedy station was expanded to serve Line 3 Scarborough, an elevated light metro line with six stations. In 2023, Line 3 was decommissioned and is planned to be replaced by a Line 2 extension to Scarborough City Centre.

Although Line 3 trains had bidirectionally operated metro trains, the tracks for Line 3 extended beyond the top-floor platform into an above-ground turning loop, similar to those found on the Toronto streetcar system. This was because Line 3 had been planned as a dedicated right-of-way streetcar line rather than a metro line. As such, the top-floor platform was designed to operate streetcars. Line 3 was later built as a medium-capacity rail transport line to use the Intermediate Capacity Transit System train models built by Bombardier Transportation. The line began using two-car trains, which were able to travel along the turning loop, but was later converted to use four-car trains, which could not be operated along the tight loop. Thus, the use of the loop for reversals was discontinued after 1988, although the loop&#x27;s elevated structure remains over the passenger pick-up and drop-off building and was occasionally used as a tail track to store trains. The station platform was reduced to a single track and began using the Spanish solution of unloading and boarding passengers at Kennedy. Original floor finishing and platform edge markings for the planned light rail can also be seen along the current tracks.

== Public art ==

Kennedy station used to feature a mural titled &quot;A Sense of Place&quot; by artist Frank Perna. The mural was completed in 1997 and used to wrap around the station&#x27;s main entrance, but when the entrance was demolished in 2018, half of the mural was destroyed.

As part of a program to install artworks at major interchange stations along Line 5 Eglinton, Kennedy station will feature two new artworks when the line opens. A mural titled &quot;Reorganization of One Hedge&quot; by artist Dagmara Genda will consist of photographs of leaves taken from the same hedge that will be printed on the glass of a skylight. A second artwork, titled &quot;Locations of Meaning&quot; by artist Joseph Kosuth, will consist of etched tiles with stainless steel inserts, each spelling the word &quot;meaning&quot; in one of 72 languages used in Toronto.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/06/30&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surface connections ==

There are two bus platforms at Kennedy station. Platform A, within the fare-paid zone, contains bus bays 1 through 10. Bus platform B, opened on October 8, 2023, is located outside of the station building on the south side of platform A and contains bus bays 11 through 18, primarily serving buses running express to Scarborough Centre station. As of February 18, 2024, bus bays 6 through 10 are closed for construction related to the Scarborough Subway Extension.

While the subway is closed, passengers may board buses outside the station near Transway Crescent. TTC routes serving the station include:

<doc id="1305538" wikidata="Q3074270" url="?curid=1305538" title="Florida Department of Transportation">
<text>The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is a decentralized agency charged with the establishment, maintenance, and regulation of public transportation in the state of Florida. The department was formed in 1969. It absorbed the powers of the State Road Department (SRD). The current Secretary of Transportation is Jared W. Perdue.

==History==
The State Road Department, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Department of Transportation, was authorized in 1915 by the Florida Legislature. For the first two years of its existence, the department acted as an advisory body to the 52 counties in the state, helping to assemble maps and other information on roads.

The 1916 Bankhead Act passed by Congress expanded the department&#x27;s responsibilities and gave it the authority to: establish a state and state-aid system of roads, engage in road construction and maintenance, acquire and own land, exercise the right of eminent domain, and accept federal or local funds for use in improving roads.

The Office of Motor Carrier Compliance created in 1980 transitioned from the Florida Department of Transportation to the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) division of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) on July 1, 2011. The consolidation is a result of Senate Bill 2160, passed by lawmakers during the 2011 Legislative Session, and placed the commercial vehicle licensing, registrations, fuel permits, and enforcement all under the purview of DHSMV.

==Structure==
The Florida Transportation Commission, made up of nine commissioners chosen by Florida&#x27;s governor and Legislature, provides oversight for the state&#x27;s department of transportation (DOT).

The department consists of seven geographic districts. In May 1994, an eighth district was formed for the state&#x27;s Turnpike System. In April 2002, the Turnpike district expanded as Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE) and operates as the business unit for the department. The FTE owns and maintains of toll roads.

Each district is managed by a district secretary. The department also owns and maintains other toll roads and bridges: the Garcon Point Bridge, Sunshine Skyway Bridge, Alligator Alley, the Beachline East Expressway, the Pinellas Bayway, and the Seminole and Lake County portions of otherwise Central Florida Expressway Authority owned roads. Tolls on all department-owned facilities are collected by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise. In addition, FDOT operates and manages several park-and-ride lots and Commuter Assistance Programs throughout the state. The seven districts each have a Districtwide Commuter Assistance Program.

===Districts===

Florida has seven transportation districts and a separate unit for tolled facilities under Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise. Each district is managed by a district secretary. Each district also has major divisions for administration, planning, production, and operations.
===Notable projects===
In 1954, the State Road Department completed the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge, the first fixed span to connect Saint Petersburg directly to Bradenton. This greatly shortened the travel time between the two cities, as before cars would have to either use a ferry or drive about around Tampa Bay. A parallel span was completed in 1971 to make the bridge Interstate standard, and it became part of I-275. After the newer, southbound span was destroyed in 1980 when the SS &quot;Summit Venture&quot; collided into it, a replacement bridge was finished in 1987.

In 1974, FDOT completed Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, a limited access toll highway that connected the panhandle area through Orlando to Miami. The turnpike is part of an initiative to finance transportation with user fees.

<text>Lawrence East was a rapid transit station on Line 3 Scarborough of the Toronto subway until the line&#x27;s closure on July 24, 2023. It was the third-busiest station on Line 3, after and .

==History==
Lawrence East opened in 1985, along with the rest of Line 3. All bus routes that operated along Lawrence Avenue East at the time were rerouted to serve the station on March 23, 1985, one day after the opening.

The station was renovated between 2011 and 2012 to include automated sliding doors, allowing the southbound platform and the bus platform to be accessible.

In February 2021, the TTC recommended the closure of Line 3 in 2023 and its replacement by bus service until the completion of the Scarborough extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. However, the rail portion of this station permanently closed following a derailment on July 24, 2023. A new Lawrence East station is planned to be built along the planned Line 2 extension on the southwest corner of Lawrence Avenue East and McCowan Road and is scheduled to open circa 2030.

==Station description==
The small station was built on two levels. The Line 3 platforms, bus platforms, and only entrance were located on ground level. The entrance was an automatic sliding door facing north with a sidewalk connecting to Lawrence Avenue East to the west side, and an underpass underneath both the Line 3 and GO rails towards the commuter parking lot, Access Road, and Prudential Drive. Below ground level in the interior of the station was an underpass connecting the entrance to the northbound platforms through the means of stairs and escalators.

This station was a &quot;partially accessible&quot; station, as all services within the station, except for the northbound platform, were accessible. The TTC suggested that people in need of accessible service onto the northbound platform take Line 3 southbound to Kennedy station and double back to Lawrence East. An accessible fare gate was also available inside the station at the main fare booth.

The station had a bus terminal located underneath the elevated portion of Lawrence Avenue East, in the Midland Avenue and Kennedy Road corridor. At the time of its closure, five TTC bus routes (three daytime routes and two Blue Night routes) served or passed near the station, including routes running along Kennedy Road. After the Line 3 closure, the 954 Lawrence East Express bus continued to turn back at Lawrence East station until October 9, 2023, when it was rerouted to terminate at Kennedy station.
A commuter parking lot for up to 90 vehicles is located just east of the station, also underneath the elevated section of Lawrence Avenue East. Parking is managed by the Toronto Parking Authority.

==Rapid transit infrastructure in the vicinity==
Line 3 continued to travel on ground level, straight north after Lawrence East station, running parallel to the nearby railway tracks. South of the station, the line continued to travel on ground level but became elevated shortly before reaching Kennedy station, where it made a 90-degree turn.

==Planned busway stop==
The TTC plans to replace the Line 3 right-of-way with a busway between Kennedy and Ellesmere stations. According to a 2022 TTC report, the adjacent station&#x27;s bus facilities would be retained along with a pedestrian underpass for the local community to use. Buses would serve customers at new stops on the south side of the former station.

==Future replacement station==

The provincial transit agency Metrolinx is building a new subway station on Lawrence Avenue East, approximately east of the former Line 3 station. The underground station will be parallel to McCowan Road along a planned extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. It will be on a north–south alignment to the west of the Scarborough General Hospital and the new bus terminal will be located on McCowan Road west of Lawrence Avenue East. The new station and bus terminal are expected to open in 2030.

<text>Ellesmere was a rapid transit station on Line 3 Scarborough of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was located at Ellesmere Road, between Kennedy Road and Midland Avenue. 

Ellesmere was the least-used station on the entire TTC network. On average, only 1,850 passengers boarded trains here each day from 2006 to 2007 and only 1,678 from 2007 to 2008. Part of the reason for this is that there were no bus bays or bus stops at the station; passengers would have to walk to the nearest bus stop on Ellesmere Road.

==History==
Ellesmere station opened in 1985, along with the rest of Line 3.

In February 2021, the TTC recommended the closure of Line 3 in 2023 and its replacement by bus service until the completion of the Scarborough extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. The station was permanently closed earlier than expected following a derailment on July 24, 2023.

The station building was located underneath the elevated section of Ellesmere Road, in the Kennedy Road and Midland Avenue corridor. The station was fairly small and is similar in appearance to Lawrence East station. It was built on two levels, with the ground level being the Line 3 platforms and the single entrance and collector underneath it.

The entrance was accessed from either side of the station through two sets of stairs, from either Kennedy Road or Midland Avenue via Service Road. Since entering the station requires the use of stairs, this station was not accessible whatsoever.
The station also had a commuter parking lot for 68 vehicles located just to the east of the station, also underneath the elevated section of Ellesmere Road.

At the time of its closure, 6 TTC bus routes (4 daytime routes and 2 Blue Night routes) passed near the station including routes running along Kennedy Road.

==Rapid transit infrastructure in the vicinity==
North of this station, the line turned 90° east, dipping briefly into a tunnel to cross underneath the nearby GO train tracks, then rising to an elevated structure for the remainder of its route towards Midland station. South of the station, the line continued to travel at ground level alongside the GO train tracks for the remainder of the route towards Lawrence East station.

<text>James Carter Pankow (born August 20, 1947) is an American trombone player, songwriter, and brass instrument arranger who is a founding member of the rock band Chicago. He is best known for his brass arrangements, and for being one-third of Chicago&#x27;s brass/woodwind section alongside Lee Loughnane and Walter Parazaider.

==Early life, family and education==
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, of German and Irish descent, Pankow was one of nine siblings. He is the older brother of actor John Pankow, who appeared on the TV series &quot;Mad About You&quot;. The family moved to Park Ridge, Illinois, when he was eight years old.

Pankow was influenced by his musician father, Wayne. He started playing the trombone at St. Paul of the Cross Elementary School. His Notre Dame High School band instructor was Father George Wiskirchen, CSC.

Pankow earned a full music scholarship to Quincy College, where he studied the bass trombone. After completing his first year, he returned home for the summer and formed a band that began to play some live local shows. Not wanting to give up this work, Pankow transferred to DePaul University.

He is a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and he was given the National Citation as well as recognition as Signature Sinfonian along with fellow Chicago members and Sinfonians on August 26, 2009.

==Career==

===Chicago===
At DePaul, Pankow met Walter Parazaider, who recruited him to join a band, The Big Thing, which would become Chicago Transit Authority. Soon after the first album&#x27;s release, the band&#x27;s name was shortened to Chicago. Pankow has remained a member of Chicago since its inception.

In addition to playing the trombone, Pankow has composed many songs for Chicago, including the hits &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;Colour My World&quot; (both from his suite &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot;), &quot;Just You &#x27;N&#x27; Me,&quot; &quot;(I&#x27;ve Been) Searchin&#x27; So Long,&quot; &quot;Old Days,&quot; &quot;Alive Again,&quot; and (with Peter Cetera) &quot;Feelin&#x27; Stronger Every Day.&quot;

Pankow has scored most of Chicago&#x27;s brass arrangements. Although he is not one of the band&#x27;s principal vocalists, he sang lead vocals for two Chicago songs: &quot;You Are On My Mind&quot; (from &quot;Chicago X&quot;, 1976) and &quot;Till the End of Time&quot; (&quot;Chicago XI&quot;, 1977).

===Other===
Along with fellow Chicago horns Lee Loughnane and Walter Parazaider, Pankow was featured on Three Dog Night&#x27;s 1969 #15 hit &quot;Celebrate&quot; and on several tracks of the 1979 Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot; album. Pankow has appeared on several albums for the rock band Toto, including the 1982 Grammy Award-winning &quot;Toto IV&quot; and their 2006 album &quot;Falling in Between&quot;, for which he composed the brass arrangements and performed on the song &quot;Dying on My Feet&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pankow and his first wife Karen were married for 18 years. Their children are Jonathan (born 1981) and Sarah (born 1986).

Pankow and his second wife Jeanne Pacelli have two children, Carter (born 1999) and Lilli (born 2002).

<doc id="1305553" wikidata="Q6694532" url="?curid=1305553" title="Loyola Academy">
<text>Loyola Academy is a private, co-educational college preparatory high school run by the USA Midwest Province of the Society of Jesus in Wilmette, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago, and in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. It is a member of the Jesuit Secondary Education Association and the largest Jesuit high school in America, with over 2,000 students from more than 80 different zip codes throughout the Chicago area. It was founded by the Jesuits in 1909.

==History==
Loyola Academy was founded as a Roman Catholic, Jesuit, college preparatory school for young men in 1909. The school was originally located in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago, on the campus of Loyola University Chicago&#x27;s Dumbach Hall; it moved to the current Wilmette campus in 1957. Both Loyola University and its prep school adjunct, Loyola Academy, grew out of St. Ignatius College Prep, a Roman Catholic, Jesuit college preparatory school in Chicago that was founded in 1870 as St. Ignatius College, with both university and preparatory programs for young men. While St. Ignatius transitioned to being solely a preparatory school and remained in the same location, Loyola Academy and University were established in Rogers Park. All three institutions were named after the Basque intellectual and a military officer in the army of a Duke, St. Ignatius of Loyola, who founded the Jesuits.

As a precondition to granting approval to move to the suburbs, the Archdiocese of Chicago required the Jesuits to stipulate that they would continue to serve the young Roman Catholic men of the city of Chicago. Consequently, Loyola Academy has had a significant representation of Chicago residents of various financial means, giving the school an economic diversity fairly unique in the Chicago area. This was achieved through the use of various scholarships and forms of financial aid.

One of Loyola&#x27;s &quot;sister schools&quot; was Regina Dominican High School, an all-girls Academy located less than a mile away in Wilmette. Beginning in 1970, small groups of select Regina students began commuting to Loyola to take selected advanced science and computer science classes, as these classes were unavailable on their campus at the time.

The Jesuit presence has fallen off from what it once was, with some 40 priests teaching and working at the school in 1961, down to 11 out of roughly 200 staff members in 2007. The priests left for a variety of reasons. Some left due to the child abuse cases surrounding the Catholic church.

Loyola Academy affiliated with Saint Louise de Marillac High School, an all-girls high school from Northfield, Illinois and became co-educational in 1994. The affiliation was done for financial reasons. The President of Marillac was approached by Loyola to consider a co-ed option on the North Shore as requested by the Archdiocese. About that same time, Loyola added on to their existing building. In 2003, Loyola Academy opened a new campus in Glenview, Illinois. The property, near the decommissioned Glenview Naval Air Station (NAS Glenview), was purchased by Loyola in 2001 and now houses several athletic fields for lacrosse, baseball, softball, and soccer, a cross country path, and a wetland preserve area that has been used as a natural laboratory for science classes.

While Loyola Academy is a Jesuit, Catholic school, it has always admitted non-Catholics seeking a Loyola education.

==Academics==

Loyola Academy offers a comprehensive liberal arts curriculum with over 110 courses in language arts, fine arts (dance, music, theater, visual arts, and architecture), foreign languages (Spanish, French, Latin, Mandarin Chinese, and Ancient Greek), mathematics, physical education, science, social studies, and theology. (As it is a college-preparatory high school, it does not offer any true vocational courses.) The school has two competitive honors programs (the Dumbach Scholars and the Clavius Scholars) and a plethora of students enrolled in AP classes. Loyola also offers the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Program, which assists students who show the potential for success in college but may require smaller classes and extra help from teachers. Annually, about 99% of students are accepted by four-year universities.

The school fields a Certamen team and in 2005 six students received perfect scores on the National Latin Examination. Loyola is also very active in forensics, Scholastic Bowl, and Science Olympiad competitions. In 2013, Loyola&#x27;s scholastic bowl team placed third at both NAQT HSNCT and PACE NSC, the best performance of a team from Illinois at both national championship tournaments. 
==Athletics==

Loyola Academy offers 16 women&#x27;s sports and 17 men&#x27;s sports. Its varsity teams are called the Ramblers, which copied from the nickname of the varsity teams at Loyola University. The school competes as a member of the CCL.

The men&#x27;s lacrosse team won 11 State Titles and 11 runner ups with three straight championships with from 2002 to 2004, with its most recent in 2018.

Prior to the IHSA Football Championships (1974), Loyola won the Prep Bowl in 1965, 1966, and 1969. Loyola won the IHSA State Championship in football in 1993, 2015, 2018, 2022, 2023, and 2024 and was runners-up in 1992, 2011, 2013, 2016, and 2017. Former football coach John Holecek led Ramblers to the state playoffs every year since 2006, including three of the last five Illinois State 8A Finals. In November 2011, the Loyola Academy football team lost to Bolingbrook in the class 8A Illinois State championship. On November 24, 2018 Loyola won the 2018 IHSA 8A Football Championship by beating Brother Rice High School 13–3. In 2022, Loyola won the IHSA Class 8A State Football Championship by beating undefeated Lincoln-Way East High School 13–3, marking their fourth state championship win. Holecek resigned after the championship and was succeeded by Beau Desherow. Former Northwestern Wildcats football head coach Pat Fitzgerald joined the Ramblers&#x27; head coaching staff as a parent volunteer, with his middle son, Ryan, serving as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. In 2023, Loyola Academy went undefeated and beat Lincoln-Way East High School again to capture their fifth state championship win. In 2024, Loyola Academy defeated York Community High School to capture their third-consecutive state championship.

In 2014 Loyola won the Illinois State Girls Swimming Championship and defeated Fenwick 11-10 (OT) to capture the IHSA Boys Water Polo State Championship. The Ramblers were also State Water Polo Champions in 1978.

Loyola has had a storied history in rowing. In 2017, the Boys&#x27; Junior 8+ won the SRAA National Championships.

The girls lacrosse team won the 2023 IHSA state championship over Hinsdale Central.

<text>Sex differences in psychology are differences in the mental functions and behaviors of the sexes and are due to a complex interplay of biological, developmental, and cultural factors. Differences have been found in a variety of fields such as mental health, cognitive abilities, personality, emotion, sexuality, friendship, and tendency towards aggression. Such variation may be innate, learned, or both. Modern research attempts to distinguish between these causes and to analyze any ethical concerns raised. Since behavior is a result of interactions between nature and nurture, researchers are interested in investigating how biology and environment interact to produce such differences, although this is often not possible.

A number of factors combine to influence the development of sex differences, including genetics and epigenetics; differences in brain structure and function; hormones, and socialization.

The formation of gender is controversial in many scientific fields, including psychology. Specifically, researchers and theorists take different perspectives on how much of gender is due to biological, neurochemical, and evolutionary factors (nature), or is the result of culture and socialization (nurture). This is known as the nature versus nurture debate.

== Definition ==
Psychological sex differences refer to emotional, motivational, or cognitive differences between the sexes. Examples include greater male tendencies toward violence, or greater female empathy.

The terms &quot;sex differences&quot; and &quot;gender differences&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably; they can refer to differences in male and female behaviors as &quot;either&quot; biological (&quot;sex differences&quot;) &quot;or&quot; environmental/cultural (&quot;gender differences&quot;). This distinction is often difficult to make, due to challenges in determining whether a difference is biological or environmental/cultural. It&#x27;s important to note, however, that many individuals will use &quot;sex&quot; to refer to the biological and &quot;gender&quot; as a social construct.

Gender is generally conceived as a set of characteristics or traits that are associated with a certain biological sex (male or female). The characteristics that generally define gender are referred to as &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine.&quot; In some cultures, gender is not always conceived as binary, or strictly linked to biological sex. As a result, in some cultures there are third, fourth, or &quot;some&quot; genders.

== History ==
Beliefs about sex differences have likely existed throughout history.

In his 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, Charles Darwin proposed that, like physical traits, psychological traits evolve through the process of sexual selection:

Two of his later books, &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; (1871) and &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; (1872) explore the subject of psychological differences between the sexes. &quot;The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; includes 70 pages on sexual selection in human evolution, some of which concerns psychological traits.

The study of gender took off in the 1970s. During this time period, academic works were published reflecting the changing views of researchers towards gender studies. Some of these works included textbooks, as they were an important way that information was compiled and made sense of the new field. In 1978 &quot;Women and sex roles: A social psychological perspective&quot; was published, one of the first textbooks on the psychology behind women and sex roles. Another textbook to be published, &quot;Gender and Communication&quot;, was the first textbook to discuss the topic of its subject.

Other influential academic works focused on the development of gender. In 1966, &quot;The Development of Sex Differences&quot; was published by Eleanor E Maccoby. This book went into what factors influence a child&#x27;s gender development, with contributors proposing the effects of hormones, social learning, and cognitive development in respective chapters. &quot;Man and Woman, Boy and Girl&quot;, by John Money was published in 1972, reporting findings of research done with intersex subjects. The book proposed that the social environment a child grows up in is more important in determining gender than the genetic factors he or she inherits. The majority of Money&#x27;s theories regarding the importance of socialization in the determination of gender have come under intense criticism, especially in connection with the inaccurate reporting of success in the infant sex reassignment of David Reimer.

In 1974, &quot;The Psychology of Sex Differences&quot; was published. It said that men and women behave more similarly than had been previously supposed. They also proposed that children have much power over what gender role they grow into, whether by choosing which parent to imitate, or doing activities such as playing with action figures or dolls. These works added new knowledge to the field of gender psychology.

== Psychological traits ==

=== Personality traits ===

Cross-cultural research has shown population-level gender differences on the tests measuring sociability and emotionality. For example, on the scales measured by the Big Five personality traits women consistently report higher neuroticism, agreeableness, warmth and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness and openness to ideas. Nevertheless, there is significant overlap in all these traits, so an individual woman may, for example, have lower neuroticism than the majority of men. The size of the differences varied between cultures.

Across cultures, gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous, healthy, and egalitarian cultures in which women have more opportunities that are equal to those of men. However, variation in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were due to changes between men, not women, in these respective regions. That is, men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic, extroverted, conscientious and agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions. Women, on the other hand, tended not to differ significantly in personality traits across regions.

A personality trait directly linked to emotion and empathy where gender differences exist (see below) is scored on the Machiavellianism scale. Individuals who score high on this dimension are emotionally cool; this allows them to detach from others as well as values, and act egoistically rather than driven by affect, empathy or morality. In large samples of US college students, males are on average more Machiavellian than females; in particular, males are over-represented among very high Machiavellians, while females are overrepresented among low Machiavellians. A 2014 meta-analysis by researchers Rebecca Friesdorf and Paul Conway found that men score significantly higher on narcissism than women and this finding is robust across past literature. The meta-analysis included 355 studies measuring narcissism across participants from the US, Germany, China, Netherlands, Italy, UK, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Australia and Belgium as well as measuring latent factors from 124 additional studies. The researchers noted that gender differences in narcissism is not just a measurement artifact but also represents true differences in the latent personality traits such as men&#x27;s heightened sense of entitlement and authority.

Males on average are more assertive and have higher self-esteem. Females were on average higher than males in extraversion, anxiety, trust, and, especially, tender-mindedness (e.g., nurturance).

When interests were classified by RIASEC type Holland Codes (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional), men were found to prefer working with things, while women preferred working with people. Men also showed stronger Realistic and Investigative interests, and women showed stronger Artistic, Social, and Conventional interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering, science, and mathematics interests.

=== Emotion ===

When measured with an affect intensity measure, women reported greater intensity of both positive and negative affect than men. Women also reported a more intense and more frequent experience of affect, joy, and love but also experienced more embarrassment, guilt, shame, sadness, anger, fear, and distress. Experiencing pride was more frequent and intense for men than for women. In imagined frightening situations, such as being home alone and witnessing a stranger walking towards your house, women reported greater fear. Women also reported more fear in situations that involved &quot;a male&#x27;s hostile and aggressive behavior&quot;. Emotional contagion refers to the phenomenon of a person&#x27;s emotions becoming similar to those of surrounding people. Women have been reported to be more responsive to this. In fact, it was found in a study that men had stronger emotional experiences while women had stronger emotional expressivity, when it came to anger. It was also reported in a previous study that men had a higher physiological response to stimuli meant to induce anger. Seeing that emotional experience and expressivity are two different things, another study has found that &quot;the emotional responses elicited by emotional videos were inconsistent between emotional experience and emotional expressivity. Men had stronger emotional experiences, whereas women had stronger emotional expressivity&quot; where in this case emotional experience is the physiological arousal one faces due to an external stimulus and emotional expressivity is the &quot;external expression of subjective experience.&quot;

There are documented differences in socialization that could contribute to sex differences in emotion and to differences in patterns of brain activity.

Context also determines a man or woman&#x27;s emotional behavior. Context-based emotion norms, such as feeling rules or display rules, &quot;prescribe emotional experience and expressions in specific situations like a wedding or a funeral&quot;, may be independent of the person&#x27;s gender. In situations like a wedding or a funeral, the activated emotion norms apply to and constrain every person in the situation. Gender differences are more pronounced when situational demands are very small or non-existent as well as in ambiguous situations. During these situations, gender norms &quot;are the default option that prescribes emotional behavior&quot;.

Professor of Psychology Ann Kring said, &quot;It is incorrect to make a blanket statement that women are more emotional than men, it is correct to say that women show their emotions more than men.&quot; In two studies by Kring, women were found to be more facially expressive than men when it came to both positive and negative emotions. These researchers concluded that women and men experience the same amount of emotion, but that women are more likely to express their emotions.

Women are known to have anatomically differently shaped tear glands than men as well as having more of the hormone prolactin, which is present in tear glands, as adults. While girls and boys cry at roughly the same amount at age 12, by age 18, women generally cry four times more than men, which could be explained by higher levels of prolactin.

===Empathy===
Current literature has found that women demonstrate more empathy. Women perform better than men in tests involving emotional interpretation, such as understanding facial expressions, and empathy.

Some studies argue that this is related to the subject&#x27;s perceived gender identity and gendered expectations influencing the subject&#x27;s implicit gender stereotypes. Additionally, culture impacts gender differences in the expression of emotions. This may be explained by the different social roles women and men have in different cultures, and by the status and power men and women hold in different societies, as well as the different cultural values various societies hold. Some studies have found no differences in empathy between women and men, and suggest that perceived gender differences are the result of motivational differences. Some researchers argue that because differences in empathy disappear on tests where it is not clear that empathy is being studied, men and women do not differ in ability, but instead in how empathetic they would like to appear to themselves and others.

Women are better at recognizing facial effects, expression processing and emotions in general., while men were better at recognizing specific behaviour which includes anger, aggression and threatening cues. Small but statistically significant sex differences favour females in &quot;Reading of the mind&quot; test. &quot;Reading of the mind&quot; test is an ability measure of theory of mind or cognitive empathy. Overall, females have an advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition.

There are some sex differences in empathy from birth which remains consistent and stable across lifespan. Females were found to have higher empathy than males while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development. Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering had higher ERP waveforms than males. Another investigation with similar brain tools such as N400 amplitudes found higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy. Structural fMRI studies found females have larger grey matter volumes in posterior inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal cortex areas which are correlated with mirror neurons in fMRI literature. Females were also found to have stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy. The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance.

An evolutionary explanation for the difference is that understanding and tracking relationships and reading others&#x27; emotional states was particularly important for women in prehistoric societies for tasks such as caring for children and social networking. Throughout prehistory, females nurtured and were the primary caretakers of children so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the &quot;Primary Caretaker Hypothesis&quot;, prehistoric males did not have same selective pressure as primary caretakers so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.

=== Aggression ===
Although research on sex differences in aggression show that males are generally more likely to display aggression than females, how much of this is due to social factors and gender expectations is unclear. Aggression is closely linked with cultural definitions of &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot;. In some situations, women show equal or more aggression than men, although less physical; for example, women are more likely to use direct aggression in private, where other people cannot see them and are more likely to use indirect aggression in public. Men are more likely to be the targets of displays of aggression and provocation than females. Studies by Bettencourt and Miller show that when provocation is controlled for, sex differences in aggression are greatly reduced. They argue that this shows that gender-role norms play a large part in the differences in aggressive behavior between men and women.

Sex differences in aggression are one of the most robust and oldest findings in psychology. Males regardless of age engaged in more physical and verbal aggression while small effect for females engaging in more indirect aggression such as rumor spreading or gossiping. Males tend to engage in more unprovoked aggression at higher frequency than females. This greater male aggression is also present in childhood and adolescence. The difference is greater in the physical type of aggression, compared to the verbal type. Males are more likely to cyber-bully than females. Difference also showed that females reported more cyberbullying behaviour during mid-adolescence, while males showed more cyber bullying behaviour at late adolescence.

In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The relationship between testosterone and aggression is highly debated in the scientific community, and evidence for a causal link between the two has resulted in conflicting conclusions. Some studies indicate that testosterone levels may be affected by environmental and social influences. while in the biological paradigm, the relationship between testosterone and the brain is primarily studied from two domains, a lumbar puncture which is mostly used to clinically diagnose disorders relevant in the nervous system and are usually not done for research purposes, a majority of research papers however rely on measures such as blood sampling (which is in widespread use across scientific academia ) in order to calculate active testosterone levels in behavior-related brain regions while the androgen is being administered or to observe testosterone increase in (mostly) men during physical activities. Involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens, which happen at the same time as testosterone levels rise. Most studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone, although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. However, nearly all studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most studies have also found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with criminality such as antisocial behavior and alcoholism.

In species that have high levels of male physical competition and aggression over females, males tend to be larger and stronger than females. Humans have modest general body sexual dimorphism on characteristics such as height and body mass. However, this may understate the sexual dimorphism regarding characteristics related to aggression since females have large fat stores. The sex differences are greater for muscle mass and especially for upper body muscle mass. Men&#x27;s skeleton, especially in the vulnerable face, is more robust. Another possible explanation, instead of intra-species aggression, for this sexual dimorphism may be that it is an adaption for a sexual division of labor with males doing the hunting. However, the hunting theory may have difficulty explaining differences regarding features such as stronger protective skeleton, beards (not helpful in hunting, but they increase the perceived size of the jaws and perceived dominance, which may be helpful in intra-species male competition), and greater male ability at interception (greater targeting ability can be explained by hunting).

=== Ethics and morality ===

Sex differences of moral orientation find that women tend towards a more care-based morality while men tend towards a more justice-based morality. This is usually based on the fact that men have slightly more utilitarian reasoning while women have more deontological reasoning which is largely because of greater female affective response and rejection of harm-based behaviours (based on dual process theory). Women tend to have greater moral sensitivity than men. Using the five moral principles of care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity (based on moral foundations theory), women consistently score higher on care, fairness, and purity across 67 cultures. On the other hand, sex differences in loyalty and authority were small in size and highly variable across cultural contexts. Country-level sex differences in all moral foundations in relation to cultural, socioeconomic, and gender-related indicators reveal that global sex differences in moral foundations are larger in individualistic, Western, and gender-equal cultures.

== Cognitive traits ==

Sex-related differences of cognitive functioning is questioned in research done on the areas of perception, attention, reasoning, thinking, problem solving, memory, learning, language and emotion. Cognitive testing on the sexes involves written tests that typically have a time limit, the most common form being a standardized test such as the SAT or ACT. These test basic individual abilities rather than complex combination of abilities needed to solve real life problems. Analysis of the research has found a lack of credibility when relying on published studies about cognition because most contain findings of cognitive differences between the males and females, but they overlook those that do not show any differences, creating a pool of biased information. Those differences found are attributed to both social and biological factors.

It was once thought that sex differences in cognitive task and problem solving did not occur until puberty. However, as of 2000, evidence suggested that cognitive and skill differences are present earlier in development. For example, researchers have found that three- and four-year-old boys were better at targeting and at mentally rotating figures within a clock face than girls of the same age. Prepubescent girls, however, excelled at recalling lists of words. These sex differences in cognition correspond to patterns of ability rather than overall intelligence. Laboratory settings are used to systematically study the sexual dimorphism in problem solving task performed by adults.

On average, females excel relative to males on tests that measure recollection. They have an advantage on processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks. Females tend to have better object location memory and verbal memory. They also perform better at verbal learning. Females have better performance at matching items and precision tasks, such as placing pegs into designated holes. In maze and path completion tasks, males learn the goal route in fewer trials than females, but females remember more of the landmarks presented. This suggests that females use landmarks in everyday situations to orient themselves more than males. Females were better at remembering whether objects had switched places or not.

On average, males excel relative to females at certain spatial tasks. Specifically, males have an advantage in tests that require the mental rotation or manipulation of an object. In a computer simulation of a maze task, males completed the task faster and with fewer errors than their female counterparts. Additionally, males have displayed higher accuracy in tests of targeted motor skills, such as guiding projectiles. Males are also faster on reaction time and finger tapping tests.

Doreen Kimura, a psychobiologist, has published books and articles specifically on the subject of sex and cognition. Since studying gender differences in cognition, Kimura has further proved generalizations made from research data collected in the field of cognitive psychology. These scientific findings have not been generalized cross culturally. Females have shown to have a higher ability in reading facial and body cues than their male counterparts. Though studies have found females to have more advanced verbal skills, men and women in adulthood do not have varied vocabularies. Women tend to have better spelling capabilities and verbal memory.

=== Intelligence ===
An article published in the &quot;Review of Educational Research&quot; summarizes the history of the controversy around sex differences in variability of intelligence. Through modern research, the main idea has held that males have a much wider range in test performance in IQ tests. The study also analyzes data concerning differences in central tendencies through environmental and biological theories. Males were found to have much wider variation than females in areas of quantitative reasoning, spatial visualization, spelling, and general knowledge than females. In the studies conclusion, to form an accurate summary, both the variability in sex differences and in the central tendencies must be examined to generalize the cognitive variances of males and females.

Empirical studies of &quot;g&quot;, or general intelligence, in men and women have given inconsistent results, showing either no differences or advantages for either sex. The differences in average IQ between women and men are small in magnitude and inconsistent in direction.

There have been many studies where this issue has been looked into. Scientists have found that a mindset of differing intelligence is still prominent in many cultures. Databases like ProQuest Central, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched for more information on this topic. This resulted in a total of 71 studies that show a variety of gender inequalities across the world.

According to the 1995 report &quot;&quot; by the American Psychological Association, &quot;Most standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males.&quot; Arthur Jensen in 1998 conducted studies on sex differences in intelligence through tests that were &quot;loaded heavily on &quot;g&quot;&quot; but were not normalized to eliminate sex differences. He concluded, &quot;No evidence was found for sex differences in the mean level of g. Males, on average, excel on some factors; females on others&quot;. Jensen&#x27;s results that no overall sex differences existed for &quot;g&quot; has been strengthened by researchers who assessed this issue with a battery of 42 mental ability tests and found no overall sex difference.

Although most of the tests showed no difference, there were some that did. For example, some tests found females performed better on verbal abilities while males performed better on visuospatial abilities. One female advantage is in verbal fluency where they have been found to perform better in vocabulary, reading comprehension, speech production and essay writing. Males have been specifically found to perform better on spatial visualization, spatial perception, and mental rotation. Researchers had then recommended that general models such as fluid and crystallized intelligence be divided into verbal, perceptual and visuospatial domains of &quot;g&quot;, because when this model is applied then females excel at verbal and perceptual tasks while males on visuospatial tasks.

There are, however, also differences in the capacity of males and females in performing certain tasks, such as rotation of objects in space, often categorized as &quot;spatial ability&quot;. These differences are more pronounced when people are exposed to a stereotype threat to their gender, which can be as subtle as being asked for their gender before being tested. Differences in mental rotation have also been seen to correlate with computer experience and video game practice, with as little as 10 hours of video game training reducing the disparity. Other traditionally male advantages, such as in the field of mathematics are less clear; again, differences may be caused by stereotype threats to women, and several recent studies show no difference whatsoever. In some regions, especially in Arab countries, observed sex differences in math ability favor girls and women, and in gender-equal countries the traditional difference is eliminated, highlighting the importance of societal influences. Although females have lesser performance in spatial abilities on average, they have better performance in processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks, object location memory, verbal memory, and also verbal learning.

In 2021, Lise Eliot et al found no difference in overall male/female abilities in verbal, spatial or emotion processing.

=== Memory ===

The results from research on sex differences in memory are mixed and inconsistent, as some studies show no difference, and others show a female or male advantage. Females tend to perform better in episodic memory tasks and access their memories faster than males and use more emotional terms when describing memories. Females also outperform men in random word recall, semantic memory and autobiographical memory. Men are more likely to get the gist of events rather than be aware of specific details. Men also recall more factual information like childhood memories better than females, and also have increased spatial based memories. Men use strategies where they use mental spatial maps and are better at knowing absolute direction, like north and south. Women use landmarks and directional cues for spatial navigation. Also, estradiol, a hormone found in women, affects learning and memory. Estradiol affects the function related to memory in the brain because it maintains cognitive function by increasing nervous tissue growth in the brain to help maintain memory. Though women experience brain fog when they go through menopause, it has been attributed to stress and processes in frontal neural networks instead. 
=== Cognitive control of behavior ===

A 2011 meta-analyses found that women have small, but persistent, advantages in punishment sensitivity and effortful control across cultures. A 2014 review found that in humans, women discount more steeply than men, but sex differences on measures of impulsive action depend on tasks and subject samples.

== Behavior ==

=== Childhood play ===
The differences between males and females in the context of childhood play is linked to differences in gender roles. A research on the &quot;acquisition of fundamental movement skills&quot; found that even though the level of mastery for certain skills were about the same for both boys and girls, after a certain age boys have better object control skills than girls do.

Some differences in gender roles influence on childhood play are suggested to be biological. A study by Alexander, Wilcox, and Woods led to the conclusion that toy preferences are innate. The reason being that the infants in the study visually discriminated between dolls and trucks. Where as the girls preferred the dolls over the truck, the boys preferred the trucks.

Hines and Kaufman hypothesized that girls with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia who are exposed to high androgen levels during pregnancy might be more physically forceful and rougher like boys are observed to be when they play. The results of Hines and Kaufman&#x27;s research led them to conclude that androgen didn&#x27;t cause girls with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia to be rougher than unaffected girls during play. The study suggested socialization also influenced the type of play children participated in.

=== Sexual behavior ===
Psychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of these theories are consistent in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as marriage) and should also be more promiscuous (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women.

A sociobiological approach applies evolutionary biology to human sexuality, emphasizing reproductive success in shaping patterns of sexual behavior. According to sociobiologists, since women&#x27;s parental investment in reproduction is greater than men&#x27;s, owing to human sperm being much more plentiful than eggs, and the fact that women must devote considerable energy to gestating their offspring, women will tend to be much more selective in their choice of mates than men. It may not be possible to accurately test sociobiological theories in relation to promiscuity and casual sex in contemporary (U.S.) society, which is quite different from the ancestral human societies in which most natural selection for sexual traits has occurred.

Neoanalytic theories are based on the observation that mothers, as opposed to fathers, bear the major responsibility for childcare in most families and cultures; both male and female infants, therefore, form an intense emotional attachment to their mother, a woman. According to feminist psychoanalytic theorist Nancy Chodorow, girls tend to preserve this attachment throughout life and define their identities in relational terms, whereas boys must reject this maternal attachment in order to develop a masculine identity. In addition, this theory predicts that women&#x27;s economic dependence on men in a male-dominated society will tend to cause women to approve of sex more in committed relationships providing economic security, and less so in casual relationships.

The sexual strategies theory by David Buss and David P. Schmitt is an evolutionary psychology theory regarding female and male short-term and long-term mating strategies which they argued are dependent on several different goals and vary depending on the environment.

According to social learning theory, sexuality is influenced by people&#x27;s social environment. This theory suggests that sexual attitudes and behaviors are learned through observation of role models such as parents and media figures, as well as through positive or negative reinforcements for behaviors that match or defy established gender roles. It predicts that gender differences in sexuality can change over time as a function of changing social norms, and also that a societal double standard in punishing women more severely than men (who may in fact be rewarded) for engaging in promiscuous or casual sex will lead to significant gender differences in attitudes and behaviors regarding sexuality.

Such a societal double standard also figures in social role theory, which suggests that sexual attitudes and behaviors are shaped by the roles that men and women are expected to fill in society, and script theory, which focuses on the symbolic meaning of behaviors; this theory suggests that social conventions influence the meaning of specific acts, such as male sexuality being tied more to individual pleasure and macho stereotypes (therefore predicting a high number of casual sexual encounters) and female sexuality being tied more to the quality of a committed relationship.

The ovulatory shift hypothesis is the contested theory that female behaviour and preferences relating to mate selection changes throughout the ovulation cycle. A meta-analysis of 58 studies concluded that there was no evidence to support this theory. Another meta-analysis found that the hypothesis was only support in regards to short-term attraction. Additionally, a 2016 paper suggested that any possible changes in preferences during ovulation would be moderated by the relationship quality itself, even to the point of inversion in favor of the female&#x27;s current partner.

A recent study sought to test the connection between current fertility status and sociosexual attitudes and desires; the researchers concluded that their hypothesis was not met, meaning they found no connection between women&#x27;s fertility status and sociosexual desires or attitudes.

Sexual regret is also different for both sexes, as women tend to regret a past short term sexual relationship significantly more than sexual inaction, whilst men regret sexual inaction fractionally more than sexual action. Women regret actions such as losing their virginity to the &quot;wrong&quot; partner, unsafe sex and sex with a stranger significantly more than men, who conversely regret not being more sexually adventerous while young and single and being too shy to indicate sexual attraction more, indicating evidence for evolved sex differences.

==Mental health==
Childhood conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder as well as substance use disorders are more common in men. Many mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders are more common in women. One explanation is that men tend to externalize stress while women tend to internalize it. Gender differences vary to some degree for different cultures.

Men and women do not differ on their overall rates of psychopathology; however, certain disorders are more prevalent in women, and vice versa. Women have higher rates of anxiety and depression (internalizing disorders) and men have higher rates of substance abuse and antisocial disorders (externalizing disorders). It is believed that divisions of power and the responsibilities set upon each sex are critical to this predisposition. Namely, women earn less money than men do, they tend to have jobs with less power and autonomy, and women are more responsive to problems of people in their social networks. These three differences can contribute to women&#x27;s predisposition to anxiety and depression. It is suggested that socializing practices that encourage high self-regard and mastery would benefit the mental health of both women and men.

=== Anxiety and depression ===

One study interviewed 18,572 respondents, aged 18 and over, about 15 phobic symptoms. These symptoms would yield diagnoses based on criteria for agoraphobia, social phobia, and simple phobia. Women had significantly higher prevalence rates of agoraphobia and simple phobia; however, there were no differences found between men and women in social phobia. The most common phobias for both women and men involved spiders, bugs, mice, snakes, and heights. The biggest differences between men and women in these disorders were found on the agoraphobic symptoms of &quot;going out of the house alone&quot; and &quot;being alone&quot;, and on two simple phobic symptoms, involving the fear of &quot;any harmless or dangerous animal&quot; and &quot;storms&quot;, with relatively more women having both phobias. There were no differences in the age of onset, reporting a fear on the phobic level, telling a doctor about symptoms, or the recall of past symptoms.

Women are more likely than men to have depression. One 1987 study found little empirical support for several proposed explanations, including biological ones, and argued that when depressed women tend to ruminate which may lower the mood further while men tend to distract themselves with activities. This may develop from women and men being raised differently.

=== Suicide ===
Although females have more suicidal thoughts and attempts, and are diagnosed with depression more than men, males are much more likely to die from suicide. Suicide from males happens 4 times more often than among females. Also, though females try to commit suicide more often, men choose more violent methods, like guns. Women are more likely to use different methods like drug overdose or poison. One proposed cause for these disparities is socialization: men are expected to be independent and discouraged from showing weakness or emotion, while women are encouraged to share emotions and rely on support from others. Other suggested factors are societal expectations linking men&#x27;s worth to their ability to provide and men&#x27;s higher rate of alcoholism.
=== Schizophrenia ===
Women and men are both equally likely at developing symptoms of schizophrenia, but the onset occurs earlier for men. It has been suggested that sexually dimorphic brain anatomy, the differential effects of estrogens and androgens, and the heavy exposure of male adolescents to alcohol and other toxic substances can lead to this earlier onset in men. Various neurodevelopmental theories suggest the reasoning behind an earlier onset for men. One theory suggests that male fetal brains are more vulnerable to prenatal complications. Another theory argues that the gender differentiation in schizophrenia onset is due to excessive pruning of synaptic nerves during male adolescence. &quot;The estrogen hypothesis&quot; proposes that higher levels of estrogen in women has a protective effect against these prenatal and adolescent complications that may be associated with men having schizophrenia onset earlier. Estrogen can alter post-synaptic signal transduction and inhibit psychotic symptoms. Thus, as women experience lower levels of estrogen during menopause or the menstrual cycle, they can experience greater amounts of psychotic symptoms. In addition, estrogen treatment has yielded beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia.

=== Autism Spectrum Disorder ===
The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorder varies amongst males and females. Globally, data isn&#x27;t available for every individual country, but a worldwide review of epidemiological surveys, found a median of 62 out of 10,000 people have ASD. Amongst 8-year-olds in the United States 1 in 44 children have been identified with autism spectrum disorder, but it is &quot;4 times more common among males than females.&quot; According to a research looking at the disparity between the actual prevalence of ASD and what actually gets diagnosed, there is a 2:1 ratio of males to females who are undiagnosed. This same statistic suggests that females have a disadvantage when it comes to being diagnosed and are underrepresented.

The &quot;extreme male brain&quot; or empathizing–systemizing theory views the autism spectrum as an extreme version of male-female differences regarding systemizing and empathizing abilities. It&#x27;s used to explain the possible reason why males with ASD score higher on systemizing tests than females with ASD.

Symptom presentation in females with ASD is not as noticeable as it is in males. Females are better able to cope with the symptoms and often camouflage to be able to fit in socially and form relationships. Camouflaging has been suggested to be the cause of females with ASD having more emotional distress, while male counterparts usually had more external social problems.

The imprinted brain hypothesis argues that autism and psychosis are contrasting disorders on a number of different variables and that this is caused by an unbalanced genomic imprinting favoring paternal genes (autism) or maternal genes (psychosis). According to the Female Protective Effect Hypothesis, for females to develop autism they need to have acquired a wider range of genetic mutations than their male counterpart.

== Possible causes ==
Both biological and social/environmental factors have been studied for their impact on sex differences. Separating biological from environmental effects is difficult, and advocates for biological influences generally accept that social factors are also important.

=== Biological ===
Biological differentiation is a fundamental part of human reproduction. Generally, males have two different sex chromosomes, an X and a Y; females have two X chromosomes. The Y chromosome, or more precisely the SRY gene located on it, is what generally determines sexual differentiation. If a Y chromosome with an SRY gene is present, growth is along male lines; it results in the production of testes, which in turn produce testosterone. In addition to physical effects, this prenatal testosterone increases the likeliness of certain &quot;male&quot; patterns of behavior after birth, though the exact impact and mechanism are not well understood. Parts of the SRY and specific parts of the Y chromosome may also possibly influence different gender behaviors, but if so, these impacts have not yet been identified.

Biological perspectives on psychological differentiation often place parallels to the physical nature of sexual differentiation. These parallels include genetic and hormonal factors that create different individuals, with the main difference being the reproductive function. The brain controls the behavior of individuals, but it is influenced by genes, hormones and evolution. Evidence has shown that the ways that male and female children become adults is different, and that there are variations between the individuals of each sex.

==== Sex linkage ====
Certain psychological traits may be related to the chromosomal sex of the individual. In contrast, there are also &quot;sex-influenced&quot; (or sex-conditioned) traits, in which the same gene may present different phenotypes depending on sex. For example, two siblings might share the same gene of aggressiveness but one might be more docile than the other due to differences in sex. Even in a homozygous dominant or recessive female the condition may not be expressed fully. &quot;Sex-limited&quot; traits are characteristics only expressed in one sex, or only in men or women. They may be caused by genes on either autosomal or sex chromosomes. Evidence exists that there are sex-linked differences between the male and female brain.

====Epigenetics====

Epigenetic changes have also been found to cause sex-based differentiation in the brain. The extent and nature of these differences are not fully characterised. Differences in socialization of males and females may decrease or increase the size of sex differences.

=== Neuroscience ===

A 2021 meta-synthesis of existing literature found that sex accounted for 1% of the brain&#x27;s structure or laterality, finding large group-level differences only in total brain volume. This partially contradicts a review from 2006 and a meta-analysis from 2014 which found that some evidence from brain morphology and function studies indicates that male and female brains cannot always be assumed to be identical from either a structural or functional perspective, and some brain structures are sexually dimorphic.
=== Culture ===
==== Socialization ====


Differences in socialization of males and females are known to cause, decrease, or increase the magnitude of various sex differences.

In most cultures, humans are subject from infancy to gender socialization. For example, infant girls typically wear pink and infant boys typically wear blue. Gender schemas, or gendered cultural ideals which determine a person&#x27;s preferences, are also installed into our behaviors beginning at infancy.

As people get older, gender stereotypes become more applied. The social role theory primarily deals with such stereotypes, more specifically the division of labor and a gender hierarchy. When this theory is applied in social settings, such as the workplace, it can often lead to sexism. This theory also applies to certain personality trails, such as men are more typically more assertive and women more passive. According to this theory, ideally, in most cultures, the woman is to stay and tend to the house and home while the man works to both better the house itself and increase finances.

Gender roles vary significantly by culture and time period. Such differences include political rights as well as employment and education opportunities solely available to females. Homosexual people are also subject to various societal expectations. Sexual inversion was one theory of homosexuality, positing that homosexuality was due to an innate reversal of gender traits.

==== Evolutionary product ====

Donald Symons has argued that fundamental sex differences in genetics, hormones and brain structure and function may manifest as distal cultural phenomena (e.g., males as primary combatants in warfare, the primarily female readership of romance novels, etc.). There has been significant feminist critique of these and other evolutionary psychology arguments, from both within and outside of the scientific community.

<doc id="1305556" wikidata="Q2290981" url="?curid=1305556" title="The Inner Mounting Flame">
<text>The Inner Mounting Flame is the debut studio album by jazz-rock fusion band Mahavishnu Orchestra, recorded in August 1971 and released later that year by Columbia Records. After their formation, the group performed several debut gigs before they entered the studio to record their first album featuring all original material written by guitarist John McLaughlin.

==Release and reception==
&quot;The Inner Mounting Flame&quot; was released in 1971. Reviewing the album for &quot;JazzTimes&quot; in 1998, Bill Milkowski said:

One is struck by the grandiose reach of the quintet that dared to call itself an orchestra. Pieces like &quot;Meeting of the Spirits&quot; and the fragile, acoustic &quot;A Lotus on Irish Streams&quot; are like classically-inspired suites in miniature. But it was numbers like &quot;Noonward Race&quot;, &quot;Vital Transformation&quot; and especially &quot;Awakening&quot;, fueled by Cobham’s smoldering intensity on the kit and McLaughlin’s raging, distortion-soaked guitar lines, that really grabbed rock crowds. More ethereal pieces like &quot;The Dance of Maya&quot;, with its odd time signatures and arpeggios, and the haunting &quot;You Know, You Know&quot;, a drum feature for Cobham, helped to create a kind of mystique about the Mahavishnu Orchestra that was wholly unprecedented for its time.

In a retrospective review for Allmusic, Richard S. Ginell wrote that &quot;The Inner Mounting Flame&quot; &quot;is the album that made John McLaughlin a semi-household name, a furious, high-energy, yet rigorously conceived meeting of virtuosos that, for all intents and purposes, defined the fusion of jazz and rock a year after Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; breakthrough&quot;.

== Later releases ==
A remastered version of the album, on CD, was released in 1998 by Sony Music Entertainment. It features a facsimile of the LP front cover, a new set of liner notes by Bob Belden, and many photographs of the band. &quot;The Inner Mounting Flame&quot; was included in 2011 as part of &quot;The Complete Columbia Albums Collection&quot; box set, along with the other albums by the first line-up of the band, including &quot;The Lost Trident Sessions&quot;. This version includes a version of &quot;The Noonward Race&quot; recorded live at the Mar y Sol Pop Festival 3 April 1972. That version was previously available on the compilation album &quot;Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival&quot;, but the version included in the box set is two minutes longer.

<text>The International Australian Football Council (IAFC) was a body established in 1995 to govern the sport of Australian rules football internationally. It was established by a small number of amateur football bodies.

The IAFC was established after the Arafura Games, held in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.

The Arafura Games were the first international games to have Australian rules football as a competition, rather than a demonstration sport. Papua New Guinea won the Gold medal that year and retained it in subsequent games. The national delegations that fielded Australian rules football teams met and decided to form a central body to co-ordinate efforts to promote the game in their own nations. The IAFC was founded as a result of this meeting, the first president being Will McKenzie (New Zealand).

The IAFC helped organise the first Australian Football International Cup in Melbourne in 2002 which was won by Ireland.

As the primary rulemaker in Australia, the Australian Football League (AFL) refused to recognise the IAFC&#x27;s role to govern the rules of the code internationally (given that it was primarily responsible for small amateur competitions). As a response, the AFL brought on its own international game development initiatives and funding, limiting the scope and purpose of the IAFC to a promotional body. In line with these initiatives, many leagues around the world formally affiliated with the AFL and the AFL negotiated the unanimous voluntary dissolution (by member country vote) of the IAFC at the end of 2002 in a successful attempt to gain the status of world governing body.

By 2004, the AFL formed its own International Policy, the first of its kind since the formation of the IAFC and became formally recognised as the world governing body for the sport. The AFL has stated that it does not see the need for a FIFA style governing body until at least 2050. 

==Splinter group==
Some individual members of the IAFC voted to continue under the IAFC banner as the &quot;International Australian Football Confederation&quot;. Board members included Ron Barassi, Allen Aylett and Brian Dixon. This organisation was not recognised by the AFL. It instigated the Multicultural Cup competitions in 2004 and 2005, involving expatriate communities living in Australia, of which Israel won the first, while Greece won the second. It also played a role in organising the first EU Cup. This organisation eventually changed its name to Aussie Rules International (ARI) and later Australian Football International (AFI), which functions only as a development and promotional body.

==Predecessors==
The first Australasian Football Council was formed in Melbourne in 1883 to take control of all intercolonial representative matches (21 years before FIFA). However the right for the council to the laws of the game was challenged in 1894 by the Victorian Football Association, the premier league at the time, resulting in its dissolution.

In 1905, an official Australasian Football Council was formed, after delegates from the North and South Islands of New Zealand became involved. Unlike its predecessor, this body maintained control of the game internationally until 1995 when its right to govern the code was similarly challenged by the premier competition, the Australian Football League. The AFC is in no way related to the International Australian Football Council, although the principle is the same.

<text>Midland was a rapid transit station on Line 3 Scarborough of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on Midland Avenue between Ellesmere Road and Progress Avenue.

==History==
Midland station opened in 1985, along with the rest of the Scarborough line.

In February 2021, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) recommended the closure of Line 3 in 2023 and its replacement by bus service until the completion of the Scarborough extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. Line 3 was set to close in November 2023. The station was permanently closed earlier than expected on July 24, 2023, following a derailment which ultimately resulted in the TTC deciding to end Line 3 service early.

==Station description==
The station is located beside and above Midland Avenue, between Ellesmere Road and Progress Avenue. The station was fairly small compared to the other stations on the Scarborough RT line. It was built on two levels, with the two entrances on either side of Midland Avenue, as well as the collector and bus stops on ground level, and the Line 3 platforms on the level above. The east side entrance to the station was an unstaffed automatic entrance with entry only by Presto card.

The station served TTC bus routes running along Midland Avenue, Ellesmere Road and Progress Avenue, but only the 57 Midland bus stopped in front of the station. At the time of its closure, 5 TTC bus routes (4 daytime routes and 1 Blue Night route) passed by or near the station.

==Rapid transit infrastructure in the vicinity==
East of the station, the Line 3 trains continued to run elevated above the ground, and the elevation of the bridge increased as the tracks went further east towards Scarborough Centre station. West of the station, the line gradually descended until reaching a tunnel where it made a 90 degree turn south and it reached Ellesmere station as soon as it exited the tunnel.

==Nearby landmarks==
At the time of its closing, the station was next to an Atlantic Packaging facility.

<text>Jacques Bongars (155429 July 1612) was a French scholar and diplomat.

==Life==
Bongars was born at Orléans, and was brought up in the Reformed faith. He obtained his early education at Marburg and Jena, and returning to France continued his studies at Orléans and Bourges. After spending some time in Rome he visited eastern Europe, and subsequently made the acquaintance of Ségur Pardaillan, a representative of Henry, king of Navarre, afterwards Henry IV of France. He entered the service of Pardaillan, and in 1587 was sent on a mission to many of the princes of northern Europe, after which he visited England to obtain help from Queen Elizabeth for Henry of Navarre. He continued to serve Henry as a diplomatist, and in 1593 became the representative of the French king at the courts of the imperial princes. He served as a major ambassador to the Protestant princes during the War of the Julich Succession. Vigorously seconding the efforts of Henry to curtail the power of the house of Habsburg, he spent health and money ungrudgingly in this service, and continued his labors until the king&#x27;s murder in 1610. He then returned to France, and died at Paris.

Bongars wrote an abridgment of Justin&#x27;s abridgment of the history of Trogus Pompeius under the title &quot;Justinus, Trogi Pompeii Historiarum Philippicarum epitoma de manuscriptis codicibus emendatior et prologis auctior&quot; (Paris, 1581). He collected the works of several French writers who as contemporaries described the crusades, and published them under the title &quot;Gesta Dei per Francos&quot; (Hanover, 1611). Another collection made by Bongars is the &quot;Rerum Hungaricarum scriptores varii&quot; (Frankfort, 1600). His &quot;Epistolae&quot; were published at Leiden in 1647, and a French translation at Paris in 1668–1670. Many of his papers are preserved in the Burgerbibliothek at Bern, to which they were presented in 1632, and a list of them was made in 1634. Other papers and copies of instructions are now in several libraries in Paris; and copies of other instructions are in the British Museum.

<text>A demonstration sport, or exhibition sport, is a sport which is played to promote it, rather than as part of standard medal competition. This occurs commonly during the Olympic Games but may also occur at other sporting events.

Demonstration sports were officially introduced in the 1924 Summer Olympics, though some scholars consider unofficial sports prior to 1924 to also be demonstrations. Most organizing committees then decided to include at least one demonstration sport at each edition of the Games, usually some typical or popular sport in the host country, like baseball at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and taekwondo at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. From 1924 to 1992, only two Summer Olympics Games did not have demonstration sports on their program. Some demonstration sports eventually gained enough popularity to become an official sport in a subsequent edition of the Games. Traditionally, the medals awarded for the demonstration events followed the same design as the Olympic medals, but of a smaller size. They are never included in the medal count.

Demonstration sports were suspended after the 1992 Summer Olympics, as the Olympic program grew bigger and it became more difficult for the organizing committees to give them the appropriate attention, since the IOC required the same treatment to be dispensed for official and demonstration sports. It is unlikely that they will be reintroduced as a &quot;requirement&quot; for future Olympic organizing committees. However, the Beijing Olympic Committee received permission from the IOC to run a wushu (martial arts) competition parallel to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008.

From the 1984 Summer Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics, two Paralympic events (a men&#x27;s and a women&#x27;s wheelchair racing event) were included in the athletics programme of each Games. These events are considered by many as a demonstration sport, but were, in fact, used to promote the Paralympic Games. Disabled events in alpine and Nordic skiing (1988 only) were also held as demonstration sports at the 1984 and 1988 Winter Olympics.

==Summer Olympics==

Below is the list of demonstration sports at the Summer Olympic Games. &quot;Italic&quot; denotes not officially recognized as a demonstration sport by the IOC.
Under the event-based program that began with the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, the host organizing committees added the following optional sports to the program with full medal status:
*1 Although demonstration sports were introduced only in 1912, at the 1908 Olympics some sports competitions were held simultaneously to the games.
*2 Baseball was officially removed from the Olympic program after the 2008 Beijing Games. (See also 9)
*3 Was part of the program as field handball in 1936.
*4 Was part of the program between 1896 and 1924.
*5 The IOC permitted a parallel wushu competition to be run (2008 Beijing Wushu Tournament), but this was not an official demonstration sport.
*6 The IOC permitted a parallel esports competition to be run (known as the eGames), but this was not an official demonstration sport.
*7 Though not explicitly listed as a demonstration sport, the Japan Sumo Association originally planned to hold a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament between the Olympics and Paralympics as part of a larger official Olympics cultural festival; this was cancelled due to rescheduling of the 2020 Olympics to 2021.
*8 The organising committee permitted a dragon boat racing demonstration in Vaires-sur-Marne by the International Canoe Federation.
*9 On 3 August 2016, the 129th IOC Session was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At this conference, the IOC agreed on a new policy to shift the Games to use an &quot;event-based&quot; program rather than a &quot;sport-based&quot; program. Under this new policy, the host organizing committee can propose the addition of sports to the program. Baseball/softball were added back to the program for 2020 only in this way, along with karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding.
*10 On 24 June 2019, the 134th IOC Session was held in Lausanne, Switzerland. At this conference, the Paris Organising Committee proposed that surfing, sport climbing, and skateboarding all return, along with the addition of breaking. On 7 December 2020, the IOC confirmed all four sports.

==Winter Olympics==
Below is the list of demonstration sports at the Winter Olympic Games. &quot;Italic&quot; denotes not officially recognized as a demonstration sport by the IOC.
*1 Curling was part of the program in 1924, which in 2002 the IOC retroactively decided would be considered an official Olympic event.
*2 Though not listed as a demonstration sport, the Intel Extreme Masters held an esports tournament for two games (&quot;StarCraft II&quot; and &quot;Steep&quot;) with support from the IOC.

==Commonwealth Games==

Demonstration sports have also been held during the Commonwealth Games, sometimes under the heading of exhibition sports.

*1 The CGF endorsed a rugby league nines competition (2014 Rugby League Commonwealth Championship) to be held preceding the games, but this was not listed an official demonstration sport.
*2 The CGF endorsed a rugby league nines competition (2018 Rugby League Commonwealth Championship) to be held preceding the games, but this was not listed an official demonstration sport.
*3 The CGF endorsed an esports competition (Commonwealth Esports Championships) to be held during the games, but this was not listed an official demonstration sport.

<doc id="1305573" wikidata="Q1042639" url="?curid=1305573" title="Scarborough Centre station">
<text>Scarborough Centre is a bus terminal station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, serving multiple bus routes of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and one Durham Region Transit (DRT) bus route. It was also a rapid transit station serving Line 3 Scarborough of the Toronto subway system until Line 3&#x27;s closure on July 24, 2023. It is located north of Ellesmere Road between Brimley and McCowan Roads, just south of Highway 401. It was adjacent to the former Scarborough Centre Bus Terminal, which was a station for GO Transit buses and other intercity coach services until the TTC modified the facility for TTC buses.

A new Scarborough Centre station is planned to be built along the Line 2 extension east of the existing station, which is set to open circa 2030.

==History==
Scarborough Centre station was opened in 1985 along with the rest of Line 3. The station replaced transit access to the Scarborough Town Centre shopping mall&#x27;s south side (at ground level along roadway).

In 2000, this station became accessible with elevators.

The Toronto Transit Commission had planned to extend Line 4 Sheppard southeast from its current terminus at to Scarborough Centre. The 904 Sheppard–Kennedy Express bus currently links the two stations, making limited stops along Sheppard Avenue. In March 2007, however, the TTC dropped this plan when it announced its Transit City proposal to build the Sheppard East LRT. The LRT proposal was later replaced by a plan to extend Line 4 eastwards from Don Mills station to McCowan Road.

Around 2011, there was a proposal to convert Line 3 to light-rail with an extension of the Eglinton Crosstown line (Line 5 Eglinton) over the Line 3 right-of-way.

In 2013, the proposal was changed to abandon the Line 3 right-of-way and build an underground extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth along McCowan Road. This would result in the decommissioning of all Line 3 stations beyond Kennedy station. A new Scarborough Centre station would be built east of the current station and would be oriented on a north–south alignment rather than the east–west alignment of the current station. Between 2013 and 2016, the new Scarborough Centre station was planned as a through-station. In order to save money for another transit project, the plan was revised in 2016 to make it a terminal station. However, in 2019 the plan was revised again to make the new Scarborough Centre station a through-station.

In February 2021, the TTC recommended the closure of Line 3 in November 2023 and its replacement by bus service until the completion of the Scarborough extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. However, the rail portion of this station permanently closed following a derailment on July 24, 2023, after which the TTC decided not to reopen Line 3.

==Station description==
===Existing station===
The existing station is located north of Ellesmere Road, between Brimley and McCowan Roads on the south of the Scarborough Town Centre. The station was built on three levels: Line 3 used to operate through the upper level; the mezzanine, passenger entry from the mall, and an automatic entrance from Brian Harrison Way are on the middle level; and two bus terminals were located at ground level, one for TTC buses connected by an automatic entrance to the Scarborough Centre Bus Terminal for intercity buses. (In October 2022, the intercity terminal was relocated so that the TTC bus terminal could expand into its space.) There is elevator access for TTC services, making this station fully accessible to anyone with disabilities.

East of the current station, the Line 3 continued travelling east on an elevated bridge until McCowan station. West of the station, the Line 3 ran on an elevated bridge which descended after passing over Brimley Road. It continued to descend until reaching Midland station.

The TTC permanently closed the Line 3 portion of the existing station after a derailment on July 24, 2023; however, the adjacent bus facilities will be kept in operation until 2030 with its bus bays reconfigured.

===Future station===
The provincial transit agency Metrolinx is building a new underground Scarborough Centre station parallel to McCowan Road along an extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. The new station will be on a north–south alignment to the east of Scarborough Town Centre. The new station will have a new Scarborough Centre Bus Terminal serving TTC and GO Transit buses as well as the Durham Region Transit bus rapid transit line. The new station will be located east of the former station, on the east side of McCowan Road north of the Line 3 right-of-way next to the site of McCowan station. The new station and bus terminal are expected to open in 2030.

==Nearby landmarks==
Located in Scarborough City Centre, nearby landmarks include the Scarborough Town Centre shopping mall, Scarborough Civic Centre, Albert Campbell Square, Canada Centre government offices, and Scarborough YMCA.

== Surface connections ==

=== Toronto Transit Commission Bus Terminal ===
Bus routes serving the bus terminal include:
===Other operators===
====GO Transit and intercity bus services====
Scarborough Centre station was also home to the Scarborough Centre Bus Terminal, which was located directly east of the TTC bus platform. Until it closed, the former bus terminal was served by GO Transit and interurban buses, which now stop at various on-street locations near Scarborough Centre station.

====Durham Region Transit====
Since September 2023, Durham Region Transit (DRT) route 920 buses serve the TTC Scarborough Centre bus terminal. With the introduction of Ontario&#x27;s One Fare Program, a GTHA-wide fare integration program introduced on February 26, 2024, customers paying by Presto, credit or debit card are able to transfer between TTC and DRT buses without incurring an additional fare during the 2-hour transfer window. As the station is located inside the TTC&#x27;s fare-paid zone and as free card transfers need to be recorded for the province to reimburse participating transit agencies as well as to enforce double fares for customers ineligible for free transfers, passengers heading towards Durham Region board the DRT buses inside the TTC bus terminal, while those heading towards Scarborough Centre alight at nearby on-street stops outside of the station. The DRT buses previously terminated at McCowan station.

<text>The Holden Brougham is a large, luxury automobile that was produced by Holden in Australia between July 1968 and 1971.

It was based on the mainstream Holden Premier of the same years, but with a lengthened rear body. The boot was simply extended by rather than increasing the wheelbase. The Premier&#x27;s four-headlight grille was also kept. The model was a hasty response to Ford Australia&#x27;s successful Fairlane.

== History ==
The HK series Brougham was launched in July 1968 along with the new Monaro coupés, six months after the HK Series Holden Belmont/Kingswood/Premier models. The Brougham then followed the model cycles of these mainstream Holdens: the HT series was announced in July 1969 and the HG series in August 1970.

Because of its luxury positioning, the Brougham was only available with an automatic transmission, first a two-speed, then a three-speed after the HG&#x27;s launch. The only engine available in the original HK Series Brougham was a Chevrolet V8. The HT series was launched with the new Holden designed and built 308 cubic inch V8, and was the first Holden to be powered by this engine (the rest of the HT range got the 307 until the 308 was made available across the HT range in September 1969). The 308 was carried over to the HG Series Brougham.

Throughout its production life the Ford Fairlane outsold it by a large margin. The Brougham was replaced by the long-wheelbase Statesman models in 1971, on the redesigned HQ platform.

== South Africa ==
From 1969 to 1971 the Brougham was marketed in South Africa as the Chevrolet Constantia. In addition to the name change, the Constantia featured a unique grille and had trafficators on the leading edge of the front fenders (as did its little sister, the Chevrolet Kommando). It utilised a 250 cid (4,093 cc) Chevrolet inline-six or, as an option, Chevrolet&#x27;s small block V8. Either engine version came equipped with the two-speed &quot;Powerglide&quot; automatic transmission.

<text>Ruggero Bonghi (20 March 1826 – 22 October 1895) was an Italian scholar, writer and politician.

Ruggero Bonghi was born in Naples and after being widowed his mother remarried in 1840 to Saverio Baldacchini, a major influence on Bonghi. Exiled from his native city in consequence of the movement of 1848, he took refuge in Tuscany, whence he was compelled to flee to Turin on account of a pungent article against the Bourbons. At Turin he resumed his philosophic studies and his translation of Plato, but in 1858 refused a professorship of Greek at Pavia, under the Austrian government, only to accept it in 1859 from the Italian government after the liberation of Lombardy.

In 1860, with the Cavour party, he opposed the work of Giuseppe Garibaldi, Francesco Crispi and Agostino Bertani at Naples. He became secretary of Luigi Carlo Farini, during the latter&#x27;s lieutenancy, but in 1865 assumed contemporaneously the editorship of the &quot;Perseveranza&quot; of Milan and the chair of Latin literature at Florence. Elected deputy in 1860 he became celebrated by the biting wit of his speeches, while, as journalist, the acrimony of his polemical writings made him a redoubtable adversary. Though an ardent supporter of the historic right, and, as such, entrusted by the Lanza cabinet with the defence of the Law of Guarantees in 1870; his caustic tongue did not spare friend nor foe.

Appointed minister for public instruction in 1873, he feverishly reformed the Italian educational system, suppressed the privileges of the University of Naples, founded the Vittorio Emanuele library in Rome, and prevented the establishment of a Catholic university in the capital. Upon the fall of the Right from power, in 1876 he joined the opposition, and, with characteristic vivacity, protracted during two months the debate on Baccellis University Reform Bill, single-handedly securing its rejection. A bitter critic of King Humbert, both in the &quot;Perseveranza&quot; and in the &quot;Nuova Antologia&quot;, he was, in 1893, excluded from court, only securing readmission shortly before his death.

In foreign policy a Francophile, he opposed the Triple Alliance, and took considerable part in the organization of the inter-parliamentary peace conference.

<doc id="1305587" wikidata="Q1042459" url="?curid=1305587" title="McCowan station">
<text>McCowan was a terminal station on Line 3 Scarborough of the Toronto subway. The closed station is located at 1275 McCowan Road, just north of Ellesmere Road at Bushby Drive/Town Centre Court. 

In February 2021, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) recommended the closure of Line 3 in November 2023 and its replacement by bus service until the completion of the Scarborough extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. However, this station permanently closed following a derailment on July 24, 2023, after which the TTC decided not to reopen Line 3 service.

==Station description==
The station structure was built on three levels: Line 3 was on the upper floor, an automatic entrance from the Consilium Place office complex via the Pedway pedestrian walkway was on the second floor, and the station entrance from McCowan Road with the collector and the concourse was on the lower floor. At the time of its closure, 15 TTC bus routes (13 daytime routes and 2 Blue Night routes) plus one Durham Region Transit bus route passed by McCowan station.

==Rapid transit infrastructure in the vicinity==
McCowan station was the terminus station of Line 3 and lay just west of McCowan Yard (completed in 1983), which stored and maintained Line 3&#x27;s trains.

Trains used a double crossover before the station entrance, but only one side of the station was used. In earlier years both platforms were used for line-end and westbound trains, but the double crossover allowed eastbound trains to cross over to the westbound platform, making for a more efficient system. The eastbound track was used when taking trains out of service. This allowed the operator to ensure that the train was empty with no one boarding before bringing the train to McCowan Yard.

<doc id="1305596" wikidata="Q319164" url="?curid=1305596" title="Justin Hoyte">
<text>Justin Raymond Hoyte (born 20 November 1984) is a former professional footballer. Primarily a right back, Hoyte previously played for English clubs Arsenal, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Millwall and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, as well as American side FC Cincinnati in both the USL and MLS. As an international, he represented England up to under-21 level and Trinidad and Tobago at senior level.

==Club career==

===Arsenal===
Hoyte was born in Leytonstone, London, and joined Arsenal at the age of nine. He progressed through the club&#x27;s academy, and was an unused substitute in both legs of the final as Arsenal won the 2001 FA Youth Cup. He signed professional terms with Arsenal in July 2002.
Hoyte made his senior debut as an 89th-minute substitute in Arsenal&#x27;s 6–1 Premiership victory over Southampton in May 2003. He made one equally late league appearance in their 2003–04 FA Premier League-winning season, which was not enough to qualify him for a medal. Hoyte played in the 2004 FA Community Shield, again from the bench, as Arsenal beat Manchester United, and made his first senior start on 28 August 2004, away to Norwich City, as a last-minute replacement for centre-back Pascal Cygan who was injured in the warm-up. Although he conceded a penalty in Arsenal&#x27;s 4–1 win, the &quot;Independent&quot; reported that he &quot;[might] have played well enough to forestall a proposed loan to Ipswich&quot;. The loan to the Championship club fell through after Arsenal failed to sign backup for Lauren at right back, so Hoyte remained at Arsenal and finished the season with 12 appearances in all competitions.

During the summer of 2005, Hoyte was linked with a loan move to Ipswich Town, but Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger made clear he wanted the defender to play Premiership football. He was loaned to Sunderland on 31 August for the 2005–06 Premier League season; as part of the deal, Sunderland goalkeeper Mart Poom joined Arsenal as cover for Jens Lehmann. Hoyte made 31 appearances in all competitions for the club and scored once, in the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle United in April 2006.

With Gaël Clichy injured and Ashley Cole absent from the team due to his protracted transfer to Chelsea, Hoyte began the 2006–07 season as Arsenal&#x27;s temporary left back, starting against both Dinamo Zagreb and Aston Villa, although this was expected to be a temporary measure. When Clichy recovered, Hoyte moved back to his preferred right side of defence to cover for the injured Emmanuel Eboué. Hoyte scored his first goal for Arsenal on 2 January 2007 in a 4–0 defeat of Charlton Athletic, which made him the first Englishman to score for the club in their new Emirates Stadium. He finished the season with 36 appearances, a total that included a starting place in the League Cup final, which Arsenal lost 2–1 to Chelsea.

In July 2007, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that Aston Villa were set to make a £4.5 million offer to Arsenal for Hoyte, after manager Martin O&#x27;Neill prioritised bringing in someone to fill the right back position. Wenger stated that Hoyte was not going anywhere, and with Éboué playing in midfield, he was in competition with Bacary Sagna for the right back position. That season, Hoyte took his appearance total to 68 in all competitions, but made only two Premier League starts. Determined to stay and fight for his place, the player turned down a move to Aston Villa, but Arsenal were prepared to listen to offers. After Villa signed Middlesbrough&#x27;s Luke Young, Hoyte agreed to fill the vacancy at right back. Arsenal accepted a £3 million fee, the player signed a four-year contract, and the move was completed on 16 August 2008.

=== Middlesbrough ===

On 28 December 2009, Hoyte scored his first goal for Middlesbrough with a cross-shot against Barnsley. Under Tony Mowbray, Hoyte became a regular for the team.

On 8 February 2012, Hoyte was assaulted by a pitch invader during a live televised FA Cup tie between Middlesbrough and Sunderland. His attacker slid into him from behind, injuring Hoyte who was visibly seen limping during extra time. Middlesbrough then lost.

Hoyte left Middlesbrough on a free transfer in July 2012, but agreed to sign a new two-year contract later to become Mowbray&#x27;s eighth summer signing for the 2012–13 Championship campaign.

On 9 November 2012, Hoyte scored his second league goal for Middlesbrough, with an outside-foot screamer from just inside the area in a 3–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday putting Middlesbrough top of the table.

In August 2013, after Middlesbrough had signed Frazer Richardson, Mowbray said he would listen to offers for Hoyte. He had scored twice in 162 appearances for the club.

=== Later career ===
On 5 November 2013, Hoyte returned to London to join Championship club Millwall on loan. The move was made permanent on 2 January 2014. He was released at the end of the 2014–15 season, having made only three appearances for the club during his 18-month permanent spell.

Hoyte joined Dagenham and Redbridge of League Two on 30 September 2016 on non-contract terms. He remained with the club to the end of the season, and was one of at least eleven players released after Dagenham&#x27;s relegation to the National League.

In March 2017, Hoyte signed for FC Cincinnati of the United Soccer League. Cincinnati declined his contract option at the end of the 2019 season.

== International career ==
Hoyte was eligible to play for England as well as for Trinidad and Tobago. In February 2006 he rejected a call-up from Trinidad and Tobago as he wanted to play for England. Trinidad had wanted to call the player into their squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Hoyte said: &quot;It&#x27;s flattering, of course, and the chance of playing in a World Cup would be great. But for the moment I plan to concentrate purely on my England career and I&#x27;m hoping that one day I&#x27;ll be playing for England in a World Cup.&quot;

Hoyte was capped 18 times for the England under-21 team, and played all four matches at the 2007 UEFA Under-21 Championship. He took part in the epic semi-final shootout against hosts Netherlands, missing his first but scoring his second penalty as England lost 13–12. His sole goal for the team also came against the Netherlands, in November 2006.

In February 2013, Hoyte made himself available for selection for the Trinidad and Tobago national team, and he received his first call-up in March.

==Personal life==
Hoyte is the son of former British sprinters Les Hoyte (who was born in Trinidad and Tobago) and Wendy Hoyte, who won gold at the 1982 Commonwealth Games. His younger brother, Gavin, also played international football for Trinidad and Tobago. He is a cousin of British sprinter Chris Clarke. His uncle is Trevor Hoyte.

<text>A bonheur du jour (in French, &quot;bonheur-du-jour&quot;, meaning &quot;daytime delight&quot;) is a type of lady&#x27;s writing desk. It was introduced in Paris by one of the interior decorators and purveyors of fashionable novelties called &quot;marchands-merciers&quot; about 1760, and speedily became intensely fashionable. The bonheur du jour is always very light and graceful, with a decorated back, since it often did not stand against the wall (&quot;meuble meublant&quot;) but was moved about the room (&quot;meuble volant&quot;); its special characteristic is a raised back, which may form a little cabinet or a nest of drawers, or open shelves, which might be closed with a tambour, or may simply be fitted with a mirror. The top, often surrounded with a chased and gilded bronze gallery, serves for placing small ornaments. Beneath the writing surface there is usually a single drawer, often neatly fitted for toiletries or writing supplies. Early examples were raised on slender cabriole legs; under the influence of neoclassicism, examples made after about 1775 had straight, tapering legs.

The &quot;marchand-mercier&quot; Simon-Philippe Poirier had the idea of mounting bonheurs du jour with specially-made plaques of Sèvres porcelain that he commissioned and for which he had a monopoly; the earliest Sèvres-mounted bonheurs du jour are datable from the marks under their plaques to 1766-67 (&quot;illus.&quot;). Other choice examples of the time are inlaid with marquetry or panels of Oriental lacquer, banded with exotic woods, with gilt-bronze mounts.

By the mid-1770s the bonheur du jour was being made in London, where it was simply called a &quot;lady&#x27;s writing-desk&quot;.

The desk was usually kept in the lady&#x27;s bedroom where it would serve for breakfast as well as for writing letters during the day. Letter writing was one of the favorite pastimes of ladies of high birth.

<text>Lexicon was a text editor / word processor MS-DOS program that was extremely popular in the Soviet Union and Russia at the end of 1980s and in 1990s. Some estimate that Lexicon was illegally installed on 95% of all Russian PCs. The last version for MS-DOS was 1.4. Later Windows versions were developed, but they were not popular, due to easily available pirated copies of Microsoft Word.

Lexicon was originally developed at the Computing Center of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR by Ye. N. Veselov.

Lexicon could produce and edit plain text files; at the same time, it could enrich them with various formatting codes (which all started with the character 255 (0xFF)). Lexicon also included a spell checker.

Lexicon supported operations with linear and rectangular blocks; it also had convenient means for drawing tables with box drawing characters.

Lexicon could work with both &quot;osnovnaya&quot; (primary) and &quot;alternativnaya&quot; (alternative) character sets. It also included its own screen and printer fonts and keyboard drivers for use with non-russified computers.

<doc id="1305609" wikidata="Q892292" url="?curid=1305609" title="Bone State">
<text>Bone (also &quot;Boni&quot;, or &quot;Bone Saoraja&quot;) was a sultanate in the south-west peninsula of what is now Sulawesi (formerly Celebes), a province of modern-day Indonesia. It came under Dutch rule in 1905, and was succeeded by the Bone Regency.

Covering an area of , Bone&#x27;s chief town Boni, lay northeast of the city of Makassar, home to the Bugis people.

==History==
Bone was an &quot;adat&quot;-based Bugis kingdom whose origins can be traced back to the early 15th century. Its chronicle (as yet unpublished) provides detailed information on its rulers, starting from La Umasa, who ruled in the early 15th century, through to La Tenrtatta, who died in 1699. Under La Umasa and his nephew La Saliu (Kerrépelua) who succeeded him, Bone expanded from a handful of settlements around the modern capital Watampone to a small kingdom roughly one-third the size of Kabupaten Bone (the present regency).

In the early 16th century the kingdom expanded northwards, fighting with Luwu for control of the mouth of the River Cenrana, a major east coast trade exit. In 1582 Bone entered an alliance with the Wajo and Soppeng kingdoms for mutual defence against the rising power of Gowa-Tallo. This alliance became known as &quot;Tellumpocco&#x27;e&quot; ( the Three Summits) or &quot;LaMumpatue Ri Timurung&quot; ( The burying of the stones at Timurung).

In 1611, during the reign of the tenth king of Bone We Tenrituppu MatinroE ri Sidenreng, Bone was invaded by the Sultanate of Gowa and pressured to convert to Islam. Bone State later enjoyed a period of prosperity in the middle of the 17th century.

Bone became the most powerful state of South Sulawesi under Arung (ruler of) Palakka, La Tenritatta (1634 or 1635 – 1696) who sided with the Dutch admiral Cornelis Speelman against the Makasar kingdom of Gowa-Tallo, which led to the defeat and capture of Makassar in 1669. From this year until 1814 when the British temporarily gained power of the region, Bone was by treaty and in practice the overlord of South Sulawesi, with the exception of Dutch-controlled areas on the west and south coast, including the important port-city of Makassar. When the Dutch returned to Makassar in 1816 they attempted to reduce Bone&#x27;s status from equal to vassal, a move strongly resisted by Bone&#x27;s rulers.

Over the course of the 19th century, the power of Bone was reduced as a result of several wars waged against it in 1824, 1859, and 1905. Following a military defeat during the South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905, the Bone State lost its independence to the Dutch. Bone, along with Gowa, became under direct administration.

In the late 1920s, the Dutch restored many royal rulers as a way to suppress the tide of nationalist sentiment. Bone was no exception; in 1931, Mappanyuki, a scion of both the houses of Gowa and Bone, was restored to his family&#x27;s ancestral position in Watampone.

In May 1950, the people held demonstrations in Watampone against the royalty and Bone&#x27;s membership in the State of East Indonesia. This caused the sultan to join Indonesia.

==List of rulers==
Rulers of Bone used the title &quot;Arung Mangkaue&#x27; ri Bone&quot; (the king who resides in Bone), shortened to &quot;Arumpone, MangkauE, or ArungE&#x27; ri Bone.&quot;

<text>&#x27; (Greek: ; from earlier , &#x27;) is an [[ancient Greek]] word for &quot;[[tribal chief]], lord (military) leader&quot;. It is one of the two Greek titles traditionally translated as &quot;king&quot;, the other being [[basileus]], and is inherited from [[Mycenaean Greece]]. It is notably used in [[Homeric Greek]], e.g. for [[Agamemnon]]. The feminine form is anassa&quot;, &quot;queen&quot; (, from &quot;wánassa&quot;, itself from &quot;*wánakt-ja&quot;).

== Homeric &quot;anax&quot; ==

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;anax&quot; derives from the stem &quot;wanakt-&quot; (nominative , genitive ), and appears in Mycenaean Greek written in Linear B script as , &#x27;, and in the feminine form as , &#x27; (later , &quot;ánassa&quot;). The digamma was pronounced and was dropped very early on, even before the adoption of the Phoenician alphabet, by eastern Greek dialects (e.g. Ionic Greek); other dialects retained the digamma until well after the classical era.

The Greek title has been compared to Sanskrit &#x27;, a word for &quot;merchant&quot;, but in the Rigveda once used as a title of Indra in Rig Veda 5.45.6. The word could then be from Proto-Indo-European *&#x27;, roughly &quot;bringer of spoils&quot; (compare the etymology of lord, &quot;bread guardian&quot;). However, Robert Beekes argues there is no convincing IE etymology and the term is probably from the pre-Greek substrate.

=== References ===
The word &quot;anax&quot; in the &quot;Iliad&quot; refers to Agamemnon (, , i.e. &quot;leader of men&quot;) and to Priam, high kings who exercise overlordship over other, presumably lesser, kings. This possible hierarchy of one &quot;anax&quot; exercising power over several local &quot;basileis&quot; probably hints to a proto-feudal political organization of Aegean civilizations. The Linear B adjective , &#x27; (&#x27;), &quot;of [the household of] the king, royal&quot;, and the Greek word , &#x27;, &quot;royal [dwelling], palace&quot; are derived from &#x27;. &quot;Anax&quot; is also a ceremonial epithet of the god Zeus (&quot;Zeus Anax&quot;) in his capacity as overlord of the Universe, including the rest of the gods. The meaning of &quot;basileus&quot; as &quot;king&quot; in Classical Greece is due to a shift in terminology during the Greek Dark Ages. In Mycenaean times, a appears to be a lower-ranking official (in one instance a chief of a professional guild), while in Homer, &quot;anax&quot; is already an archaic title, most suited to legendary heroes and gods rather than for contemporary kings.

The word is found as an element in such names as Hipponax (&quot;king of horses&quot;), Anaxagoras (&quot;king of the agora&quot;), Pleistoanax (&quot;king of the multitude&quot;), Anaximander (&quot;king of the estate&quot;), Anaximenes (&quot;enduring king&quot;), Astyanax (&quot;high king&quot;, &quot;overlord of the city&quot;), Anaktoria (&quot;royal [woman]&quot;), Iphiánassa (&quot;mighty queen&quot;), and many others. The archaic plural &quot;ánakes&quot; (ἄνακες, &quot;Kings&quot;) was a common reference to the Dioskouroi, whose temple was usually called the Anakeion () and their yearly religious festival the &quot;Anákeia&quot; ().

The words &quot;ánax&quot; and &quot;ánassa&quot; are occasionally used in Modern Greek as a deferential to royalty, whereas the word &quot;anáktoro[n]&quot; and its derivatives are commonly used with regard to palaces.

== Mycenaean &quot;wánax&quot; ==

During the Mediterranean Bronze Age, Mycenaean society was characterized by the creation of palaces and walled settlements. The &quot;wánax&quot; in Mycenaean social hierarchy is generally accepted to function as a king, though with various roles which also stretch outside of administrative function. The term &quot;&quot;wánax&quot; is believed to have eventually transformed into the Homeric term &quot;anax&quot;&quot;&quot;,&quot; having fallen out of use with the collapse of Mycenaean civilization during the Late Bronze Age Collapse. The Greek term for kingship would transfer to &quot;basileus&quot;, which is believed to have been a subservient title in Mycenaean times akin for chieftains and local leaders.

=== Roles ===
The origin role of the &quot;wánax&quot; may be from warrior roots of migrating Indo-Europeans as a leadership role, eventually leading to the notion of kingship and the formal position and role of the &quot;wánax&quot; in Mycenaean times. The &quot;wánax&quot; during Mycenaean times was at the apex of Mycenaean society, presiding over a centralized state administration with a strong hierarchical organization; a common formula in the Bronze Age Mediterranean and Near East. This is hierarchically likened to a king, and as such much of the duties of the &quot;wánax&quot; were related to duties of administration, warfare, diplomacy, economics and religion.

=== Administrative participation ===
Administratively, Mycenaean political divisions broadly unfolded into a hierarchical division of &quot;wánax&quot; (king) with a broader structure which existed around the &quot;wánax&quot; in the form of Mycenaean palatial authority and administration. The &quot;wánax&quot; is also identified as the figure able to appoint individuals to rank within the administrative elite. Much of this administrative body functioned as the limbs by which a &quot;wánax&quot; exercised authority and action, rather than directly partaking directly in every function of the state; with only two known inscription references on record of the &quot;wánax&quot; taking direct action within the internal administrative body. However, much of the records available concerning the role of &quot;wánax&quot; deal with economic information due to the importance of such scribal records to Mycenaean states, but does not discredit the participation of the &quot;wánax&quot; directly in other facets of the state. The &quot;wánax&quot; would also delegate lands to members of this palatial elite and other hierarchic officials depending on their role, such as with the &quot;telestai&quot;. Some of these hierarchical positions under the &quot;wánax&quot; included the &quot;lawagetas&quot; (he who leads the people, a meaning which remains unclear), varying positions of which the meanings remain unknown (&quot;hektai&quot;, &quot;collectors&quot; of commodity and flock), scribes, mayors, vice-mayors, and varying styles of overseer. The term &quot;basileus&quot; is also familiar to the Mycenaean hierarchy as a local chieftain or leader, and would later come to replace &quot;wánax&quot; as the term for king after the collapse of Mycenaean civilization.

This administrative body produced or obtained many artefacts by which they might increase their prestige, or more practically manage the state of the &quot;wánax&quot; more effectively. Mycenaean administrative artefacts include tablets which carry inscriptions from a scribal body, among which are tablets of purely administrative work (accounting for state supplies of resources), which would have been designed to support the &quot;wánax&quot; and state administration, and to be supported by a state administration. Much of the surviving Mycenaean administrative records which remain primarily deal with economic affairs, and the management of state resources. Mycenaean states were active participants in diplomacy and trade, between their fellow Mycenaean states and the broader interregional bodies which surrounded them.

=== Warfare ===
Fortifications dominate the Mycenaean world, with such structures being erected across the Bronze Age, but particularly during the Late Bronze Age Collapse (where the necessity for such fortifications intensified), before the end of Mycenaean civilization. Being prolific builders of fortifications, &quot;wánaxes&quot; actively engaged in warlike campaigning in and around their states, though evidence for their direct participation is minimal. Evidence from Pylos suggests that the &quot;wánax&quot; was in possession of weapons specifically indicated as royal. Stronger evidence exists that the &quot;wánax&quot; assigned military leadership to other members of the palatial elite. At Pylos, a name identified as &quot;e-ke-ra-wo&quot; is speculated to either be a &quot;wánax&quot; or another person of importance, and was tasked with managing the rowers of Pylos in particular.

=== Ahhiyawa texts ===
The Ahhiyawa texts include correspondences between unnamed Mycenaean &quot;wánaxes&quot; and the Hittite kingdom. One such text from the collection, known as the &quot;Tawagalawa Letter&quot;, was composed from the King of Hatti to an unnamed Mycenaean &quot;wánax&quot;, and contained diplomatic correspondences regarding a man by the name of Piyamaradu, who had acted against the Hittite King; and that the &quot;wánax&quot; should either return him or reject him. The same text informs that the unnamed &quot;wánax&quot; had previously been in conflict with the Hittites over the territory of Wilusa&quot;,&quot; though there is no further conflict between them. The Hittite King refers to the &quot;wánax&quot; not by title but as &quot;brother&quot; in these texts, a common practice in the ancient Near East in diplomatic correspondences with powers viewed as equal participants in interregional status. Another text which is heavily fragmented was sent by a &quot;wánax&quot; to the King of Hatti (likely Muwattalli II) concerning the ownership of islands.

=== Economic participation ===
&quot;Wánaxes&quot; have much heavier evidence of participation in state economics, taking a more direct role rather than the hierarchical allocations and lack of evidence for administrative participation. The lands of the &quot;wánax&quot; were closely tied to economic output of foods and commodity goods. Economically, various records exist which refer to &quot;wanakteros,&quot; royal craftsmen, under the employ of the &quot;wánax&quot;. These craftsmen came in a variety of roles, from practical purposes to commodity production, though not all craftsmen were exclusively royal in nature in the Mycenaean economic sphere. Additionally, the royal designation is applied not only to craftsmen within the economy, but to storehouses of jars believed to contain olive oil; indicating the presence of royal products which were circulated within Mycenaean civilization and beyond. Royal employment would indicate that the &quot;wánax&quot; acts much more closer to the economy as a sort of overseer or administrator than to many of the other tasks of the state. However, much of the records available concerning the role of &quot;wánax&quot; deal with economic information due to the importance of such scribal records to Mycenaean states, but does not discredit the participation of the &quot;wánax&quot; directly in other facets of the state. Mycenaean elite also utilized luxury items to accentuate their status, and placed high value economically and politically on such items.

Another major economic function of the &quot;wánax&quot; was the participation in and organization of elaborate feasting amongst the Mycenaean elite, and shared with those outside the immediate palatial elite as well. Feasts required extensive planning and organization on the part of the &quot;wánax&quot; and palatial administration, which needed to mobilize large amounts of resources in order to host such elaborate feasts. A major feature of these feasts involved drinking, as evidenced by the many prestige drinking vessels recovered. These processes economically involved the collection and feeding of vast quantities of livestock, luxury items for the elite (feasting equipment like luxury pottery and cups) and politically demonstrated the authority of the &quot;wánax&quot; with his elite. One manner in which feasting further secured the &quot;wánax&quot; economically and politically was the inclusion of lower elites (local leaders and other non-palatial authorities under the &quot;wánax&quot;) in feasting, both building social connections to the &quot;wánax&quot; and economically persuading lower elites to dedicate resources to palatial feasting.

=== Religious participation ===
The &quot;wánax&quot; were extensively involved in cultic practice during the Mycenean period of Greek religion, participating and playing a central role in Mycenaean religion. Much of this was involved in ritual practice from feasting to ceremonies dedicated to the gods, with the &quot;wánax&quot; being evidenced to perhaps been ritually involved in cultic activities which involve the use of oil and spice. Mention of oil and spice, and mention of the &quot;wánax&quot; being closely related to religious practice, has led some scholars to speculate the potential of kingship being semi-divine in Mycenaean Greece; however evidence is lacking for this claim, perhaps from an overzealous desire to seek out connections between &quot;wánax&quot; and goddesses such as Demeter and Persephone. It is more likely the &quot;wánax&quot; was viewed as a mortal king. &quot;Wánaxes&quot; were especially involved in feasting, and therefore all religious feasting would&#x27;ve been reliant on the &quot;wánax&quot; to economically support and participate in.

<text>Sebastian Steve Qvacoe Cann-Svärd (born 15 January 1983), commonly known as Sebastian Svärd, is a Danish former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder.

==Club career==
Svärd was born in Hvidovre, Denmark, to a Swedish mother and Ghanaian father, and grew up in Urbanplanen, a neighbourhood consisting of subsidized housing in Vestamager. He started out at local Amager-based club B.1908, before moving to Kjøbenhavns Boldklub, the reserve team of F.C. Copenhagen. Here he was seen as a prodigy, impressing the coaches of the Denmark under-16, under-17 and under-19 national teams. As so he was bought by English club Arsenal for an undisclosed fee in November 2000.

He won the FA Youth Cup with the club&#x27;s academy in his first season. His first-team Arsenal debut came in a League Cup fourth round match on 27 November 2001, as a substitute in a 2–0 win over Grimsby Town. Over the next two years, he made two more appearances for Arsenal, one more in the League Cup against Sunderland and one in the FA Cup against Oxford United. Arsenal went on to win the FA Cup final that season but Svärd was left out of the squad.

He returned on loan to his old club Copenhagen in August 2003, in need of first-team play; after just four months he returned to England to play for Stoke City, for whom he played nine league matches and scored one goal against Sunderland. In August 2004, he came on as a substitute in Arsenal&#x27;s 3–1 Community Shield victory over Manchester United.

As such soon afterwards he was loaned to Danish club Brøndby IF for the whole season. At Brøndby, he played both as a defensive midfielder and right back, in a season which ended with both the Danish Superliga championship and triumph in the Danish Cup tournament. Altogether Svärd was capped a sum of four times for the Gunners.

In July 2005, he left Arsenal to join Portuguese club Vitória Guimarães for an undisclosed fee.

After a single season with Vitória, where he was, and still is a beloved player, he moved to Borussia Mönchengladbach on 21 June 2006, again for an undisclosed fee. On 25 February 2007, he played his first Bundesliga match for Mönchengladbach against Werder Bremen. He was snapped on loan upon 8 January 2009 by Hansa Rostock.

On 15 January 2010, he moved on from Borussia to become a free agent. Svärd was then signed only three days later by Dutch club Roda JC. Svärd then returned to Denmark and played three matches for Silkeborg IF in 2011–12. He was released by the club in June 2012, upon expiration of his contract.

In August 2012, he had two trials which did not result in a contract for him: with German club SC Paderborn 07 and with Hapoel Ramat Gan in Israel.

He joined Swedish side Syrianska for the 2013 Allsvenskan.

On 24 October 2013, he joined Wycombe Wanderers on a one-month contract.

In January 2014, Svärd signed with Thai club Songkhla United.

On 11 January 2016, he returned to Europe to sign with Icelandic top division club Þróttur. At the end of the season, Svärd left the club.

==International career==
Svärd debuted for the Denmark under-21 national team in November 2002. He played more than 50 matches for various Danish youth national teams.

<doc id="1305623" wikidata="Q8026235" url="?curid=1305623" title="Winter Guard International">
<text>Winter Guard International (WGI) is an American governing body that sanctions championship events for three competitive performing arts activities: winter guard, percussion ensembles, and indoor wind ensembles. WGI was founded in 1977 in response to inconsistent adjudication and rules of competition which made it difficult for color guards to compete nationally. Today, WGI publishes and maintains an adjudication handbook, with an accompanying &quot;Rules &amp; Regulations&quot;, that has been widely adopted.

WGI championship events are hosted from January to March and conclude with WGI World Championships in April. The first World Championship was hosted at Conant High School in Hoffman Estates, Illinois on April 15, 1978. World championships for percussion ensembles began in 1992, and indoor marching bands, called winds, in 2015. A series of field band competitions, promoted as the WGI Friendship Cup were hosted from 1997 to 2003. The next World Championships is scheduled for April 2025 at UD Arena.

A majority of WGI&#x27;s championships are hosted in the United States, however regional championships have been hosted in Japan, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Philippines, and Costa Rica.

== History ==
Prior to the formation of WGI, national color guard championships, or other high-prestige championships, were held in conjunction with drum corps or marching band championships, such as: VFW, American Legion, CYO, or DCI World Championships. The quality of hosts varied widely, as did as the quality of venues and adjudication. As an example, the 1977 &quot;national&quot; color guard championship was held in conjunction with DCI World Championships in Denver. The venue was far too small, there was no functional air conditioning, and the performance area required color guards to maneuver around structural columns.

In 1977, then director of the Seattle Imperials, Stanley Knaub, secured a sponsor—Western Youth International—and a potential venue for a new national championships. However, Knaub was encouraged to seek input from others in the activity by Shirlee Whitcomb and Bryan Johnston. Knaub invited color guard educators from across the country to a meeting on May 14, 1977, at the Sheraton Palace Hotel in San Francisco. Those in attendance included: Don Angelica, Marie Czapinski, and Linda Chambers, in addition to Whitcomb, Johnston, and representatives from Western Youth International. All agreed any future national championship should be held independent of any drum corps or marching band events. Knaub suggested scheduling the championship during the winter months when most color guards competed locally—after marching band season when scholastic bands focused on concert events, but prior to the drum corps season. Whitcomb, Czapinski, and Chambers, advocated for a regional championship system with a national championship at the end of the winter season. The name &quot;Winter Guard International&quot; was suggested by Don Angelica.

A follow-up meeting at the December 1977 DCI Rules Congress included representatives from thirteen color guard circuits and adjudicator associations. The representatives adopted a draft adjudication system and rulebook, as well voting on an organizational structure. Lynn Lindstrom, director of the Midwest Color Guard Circuit, was elected the first Executive Director of WGI. Four competition circuits each donated $250 to fund WGI&#x27;s first competitive season of fourteen regional championships and a two-day national championship called WGI Olympics. The first championship was hosted by Conant High School in Hoffman Estates, Illinois on April 14–15, 1978. In attendance were twenty-five color guards, the top fifteen advanced to the finals competition. National championships would become the WGI World Championships in 1990.

== About ==
WGI is a nonprofit association governed by a board of directors, with an Executive Director, responsible for day-to-day operations. The board of directors are chosen from among the directors of competing groups, and at-large members are chosen from the community of color guard, percussion, and winds educators. The board of directors is legally and financially responsible for the conduct of the organization. In 2022, WGI&#x27;s various programs and activities generated million in revenues.

=== Mission and purpose ===
The mission of organization is to provide a venue for young people to achieve the extraordinary through performance and competition. WGI organizes &quot;high-energy and enjoyable&quot; events for color guard, called winter guard, percussion and winds, divisions. The organization also aims to improve quality of the competing groups through leadership development and education. This includes standardized adjudication.

WGI frequently partners with companies that provide services and products to competing groups, as well as leading educators in other fields to highlight the activity. The organization is promoted using the tagline: &quot;Sport of the Arts&quot;.

=== Advisory Boards ===
Each of the three competitive divisions (color guard, percussion and winds) are led by Advisory Boards who are responsible for the &quot;adjudication and competitive attributes&quot; of sanctioned events. Advisory boards are also responsible for nominating and electing members to the board of directors.

The Advisory Boards meet annually, usually a few months after World Championships, to discuss changes to rules of competition, adjudication, and policies and procedures, and to make recommendations to the board of directors. The promotion of competing groups is also the responsibility of the Advisory Boards.

=== Membership ===
Groups that compete at WGI events are required to pay a membership fee, in addition to an attendance fee for each event. Only groups who compete in a regional, beginner, class with limited availability (Regional A Class) are excused from paying a membership fee. The fees support general operations, and provide capital for future events, educational services, and research and development.

=== Scholarships ===
WGI awards academic scholarships to members of competing groups, which are announced during awards ceremonies at World Championships. According to the WGI website, over is awarded annually, and has been awarded since 1978. Funds for scholarships are raised via raffles drawn during WGI events known as &quot;Fifty-fifty&quot;.

=== Hosted competitions ===
Using a competition-based approach for organizing events, WGI &quot;aims to showcase youth activities&quot; by pursuing a &quot;high standard of achievement.&quot; More than sixty regional championships are hosted every year, from mid-January to the late-March. Many are hosted with the aid of WGI&#x27;s regional circuit partners. Regional championships attract hundreds of color guards, percussion and winds ensembles, and thousands of participants. To qualify for World Championships, groups must compete in at least one regional championship.

World Championships regularly attracts over 350 color guards, 250 percussion ensembles, and over 40 winds groups. Championships occur over two consecutive weekends in early or mid-April. Future World Championships dates have been reserved until 2024.

=== Alterations due to Covid-19 ===
In March 2020, the 2020 World Championships were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 WGI season was conducted using online tools as a WGI Virtual Season. Participants were given the option to participate in solo, small group, and large group categories.

== Classification and adjudication ==
=== Winter Guard ===

Winter guard is the indoor variant of color guard and is a combination of the use of flags, sabers, mock rifles, and various other equipment and props. Performances include dance and other interpretive movement. Color guards are common among high schools, middle schools, some universities, and also some independent organizations such as drum corps, or they are community organizations. The term &quot;winter guard&quot; is taken from the season most color guards compete as single units, and not part of marching bands or drum corps.

=== Percussion ===

An indoor percussion ensemble or indoor drumline consists of marching percussion (also called the &quot;battery&quot;) and front ensemble (also called pit or front line) sections. Many ensembles, like color guards, are attached to a competing marching band or drum corps, but many are independent ensembles. Indoor percussion integrates musicality, marching and movement, and theater arts. The activity is referred to as percussion theater by WGI.

There is also a &quot;concert&quot; classification for scholastic percussion ensembles without drumline, named so because performers are typically stationary, with no drill.

=== Winds ===
Indoor winds ensembles or indoor winds are small marching music ensembles composed of a variety of instrumentations. These ensembles are distinct from field bands, or marching bands. Many take advantage of marching horns, as well as woodwinds, rhythm sections, and a pit ensemble but not a full drumline or color guard. Unlike their outdoor counterparts, WGI Winds compete indoors on a performance area roughly the size of a standard basketball court. WGI&#x27;s previous experiments in marching band competition were known as the Friendship Cup.

=== Divisions and classes ===
Groups attending WGI events are organized according to a multi-tier system, placed in one of two divisions, and dozens of classes.
* Independent Color guard, Percussion, and Winds divisions are reserved for groups composed of performers who are not associated with a particular secondary school. Independent groups often draw performers from a large geographic area and many are affiliated with colleges and universities.
* Scholastic Color guard, Percussion, and Winds divisions are reserved for groups composed of performers from the same high school, or high school equivalent, or a school within the attendance zone of that particular high School. The Scholastic division was created in 1980. Prior to the division&#x27;s creation high school groups competed against Independent groups.

Divisions are further grouped into classes based on experience and achievement:
* Regional A is for new and inexperienced scholastic division groups. This class is not available at World Championships.
* A Class, often referred to as National A or National, is for groups new to national competition.
* Open Class is for groups who consistently perform at an intermediate developmental level.
* World Class is the highest available class and is reserved for experienced groups. The World classes in both Scholastic and Independent are the most competitive and the highest prestige.

=== Historic classes and divisions ===
The following are the divisions and classes represented at World Championships.

Notes:
* The tables below are simplified and do not reflect when specific competitive classes and divisions were defined in the WGI Adjudication Handbook.
* Other classes and divisions may be represented at regional championships or other WGI-sanctioned competitions.

=== Adjudication ===
WGI Adjudication Manuals for color guards, percussion, and winds, championships divide scoring in set reference criteria known as captions forming a scoring rubric. Each caption is subdivided into elements such as performance analysis, design analysis, and effect evaluation. The adjudication manual is multi-tiered, meaning each competitive class—Regional A, A Class, Open Class, and World Class—has a set of scoring sheets listing differing criteria and descriptions for each caption.

Contemporary Color is a 2016 film directed by Turner Ross and Bill Ross featuring performances of several winter guard teams. The film was produced as a collaboration between David Byrne, Michael Gottwald, Dan Janvey and Josh Penn. Similarly, &quot;On Guard: A Story of American Youth&quot; is 2023 documentary film directed by Allen Otto and executive produced by Jim Czarnecki. The film follows the journey of an all-female color guard team at Bel Air High School whose goal is to qualify for the 2020 WGI World Championships, which were ultimately canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a performance dedicated to the victims of the 2019 El Paso Shooting.

<text>The Ballon d&#x27;Alsace (; , ) (el. 1247 m.), sometimes also called the Alsatian Belchen to distinguish it from other mountains named &quot;Belchen&quot;) is a mountain at the border of Alsace, Lorraine, and Franche-Comté. From its top, views include the Vosges, the Rhine valley, the Black Forest, and the Alps.

A road leads over a pass near the peak at the Col du Ballon d&#x27;Alsace, . The pass is noted as the site of the first official mountain climb in the Tour de France on 11 July 1905, the first rider to the top of the climb being René Pottier and the stage being won by Hippolyte Aucouturier. Stage 9 of the 2005 Tour crossed this pass on the centenary of the original climb.

Ballon d&#x27;Alsace features Alpine and Cross Country skiing tracks.

The mountain is part of the so-called Belchen system, a group of mountains with the name &quot;Belchen&quot; (in German) that may have been part of a Celtic sun calendar.

<text>Hermann Bonitz (29 July 181425 July 1888), German scholar, was born at Langensalza in Prussian Saxony.

Having studied at the University of Leipzig under G. Hermann and at Berlin under Böckh and Lachmann, he became successively teacher at the Blochmann-Institut in Dresden (1836), &quot;Oberlehrer&quot; at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium (1838) and the Graues Kloster (1840) in Berlin, professor at the gymnasium at Stettin (Szczecin) (1842), professor at the University of Vienna (1849), member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences (1854), member of the council of education (1864), and director of the Graues-Kloster-Gymnasium (1867). He retired in 1888, and died in that year at Berlin.

He took great interest in higher education, and was chiefly responsible for the system of teaching and examination in use in the high schools of Prussia after 1882. But it is as a commentator on Plato and Aristotle that he is best known outside Germany. His most important works in this connection are:
*&quot;Disputationes Platonicae Duae&quot; (1837); &quot;Platonische Studien&quot; (3rd edition, 1886).
*&quot;Observationes Criticae in Aristotelis Libros Metaphysicos&quot; (1842).
*&quot;Observationes Criticae in Aristotelis quae feruntur Magna Moralia et Ethica Eudemia&quot; (1844).
*&quot;Alexandri Aphrodisiensis Commentarius in Libros Metaphysicos Aristotelis&quot; (1847).
*&quot;Aristotelis Metaphysica&quot; (1848–1849).
*&quot;Über die Kategorien des A.&quot; (1853).
*&quot;Aristotelische Studien&quot; (1862–1867).
*&quot;Index Aristotelicus&quot; (1870).
Other works:
*&quot;Über den Ursprung der homerischen Gedichte&quot; (5th edition, 1881).
*&quot;Beiträge zur Erklärung des Thukydides&quot; (1854), &quot;des Sophokles&quot; (1856–57).
He also wrote largely on classical and educational subjects, mainly for the &quot;Zeitschrift für die österreichischen Gymnasien&quot;.

A full list of his writings is given in the obituary notice by Theodor Gomperz in the &quot;Biographisches Jahrbuch fr Altertumskunde&quot; (1890).

<text>Plateia or Platia (&quot;πλατεία&quot;) is the Greek word for town square. Most Greek and Cypriot cities have several town squares which are a point of reference in travelling and guiding. In traditional societies like villages and provincial communities, plateies are the central places for feasts, celebrations, events and meetings.

==Ancient Greek Cities==

The original ancient Greek word (plural &quot;plateiai&quot;) meant one of the (usually 3) main streets in an ancient Greek city such as Naples. The &quot;stenopoi&quot;, narrower, mainly north-south, streets were placed between the &quot;plateia&quot; in the orthogonal town plan to form rectangular blocks for buildings.

<doc id="1305648" wikidata="Q465665" url="?curid=1305648" title="Michelle Stephenson">
<text>Michelle Stephenson (born 3 January 1977) is a British pop singer and television presenter. At the age of 17, she was briefly a member of the girl group that would go on to become the Spice Girls.

==Touch (Spice Girls)==
Alongside Melanie Brown, Victoria Adams (later Beckham), Melanie Chisholm and Geri Halliwell, Stephenson completed the original 1994 line-up of Touch, a girl group that would later go on to become the Spice Girls. Stephenson received the highest scores at the first audition, where she sang Dina Carroll&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Stranger&quot;. Stephenson was a member of the group for only a short period before commitment issues prompted Heart Management to remove her. According to Bob Herbert, she was fired because &quot;she just wasn&#x27;t fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go&quot;. Stephenson later challenged Herbert&#x27;s claim, stating that it was her decision to leave due to her mother being diagnosed with breast cancer. Beckham later dismissed this claim, saying she &quot;just couldn&#x27;t be arsed&quot; to put in the work the rest of the group was doing. Chisholm stated in her 2022 memoir, &quot;Who I Am: My Story&quot;, that Michelle was undecided if she wanted to remain in the band or attend university, and that she did not share the same passion for the band as the others, even being found sunbathing during early rehearsals. Stephenson was replaced by Emma Bunton.

Stephenson has given several conflicting interviews about her time with the group, stating that she both does and does not regret leaving them. She has also joked she would have been known as Mel S and it would have been confusing if the band also had a Mel C and a Mel B, and has also asserted she was going to be known as Sexy Spice. (The nicknames were given by &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; magazine after launch.) Stephenson claims she was very close with Geri whilst in the band and wishes they had remained friends, but noted in an interview that she and Beckham did not always see eye to eye. 

Stephenson&#x27;s boldest claim was that the reason Beckham does not have any solo lines in the group&#x27;s first song &quot;Wannabe&quot; is due to the single being written with Stephenson as part of the group, Beckham subsequently refusing to take Stephenson&#x27;s solo lines. However, many other accounts suggest that &quot;Wannabe&quot; was written after Stephenson had left the group, and that Beckham&#x27;s absence from the track was due to a scheduling conflict during the writing sessions.

Stephenson worked briefly as a television presenter for LWT, ITV, Friendly TV, and BSkyB. She also filmed a television show in Malta called &quot;Wild Games&quot; before forming a songwriting partnership with Ben Hackett and Mike Edwards (under the name SHEsongs). She has also worked as a session singer for various record companies. She performed backing vocals for singers like Ricky Martin and Julio Iglesias, while working on her own songs as well. In November 2003, Stephenson recorded and released an EP entitled &quot;SHESongs&quot;, featuring six songs called &quot;In Control&quot;, &quot;Fall Over&quot;, &quot;Hey Sugar&quot;, &quot;Dirty Music&quot;, &quot;Boom, Boom&quot;, and &quot;Happens for a Reason&quot;.

<text>The 1999 Major League Soccer season was the fourth season of Major League Soccer. It was also the 87th season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer in the United States, and the 21st with a national first-division league. This was the last season which used the 35 yard line shootout rule to resolve tied games, and that of the countdown timer, with MLS Cup 1999 adopting the IFAB-standard running clock thereafter. 

The Columbus Crew moved into the first soccer-specific stadium when Columbus Crew Stadium opened on May 15, 1999.

The regular season began on March 20, and concluded on October 10. The 1999 MLS Cup Playoffs began on October 16, and concluded with MLS Cup 1999 on November 21. D.C. United won their second double by winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield and defeating the Los Angeles Galaxy in MLS Cup.

==Overview==

===Season format===
The season began on March 20 and concluded with MLS Cup on November 21. The 12 teams were split evenly into two conferences. Each team played 32 games that were evenly divided between home and away. Each team played every other team in their conference four times, for a total of 20 games. The remaining schedule consisted of two games against each team from the opposite conference.

The top four teams from each conference qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs. The conference semifinals and finals were played as a best-of-three series, and the winners advanced to MLS Cup. In all rounds, draws were broken by penalty shootout if necessary. The away goals rule was not used in any round.

The team with the most points in the regular season was awarded the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield. The winner of MLS Cup, and the runner-up, qualified for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

<doc id="1305653" wikidata="Q902605" url="?curid=1305653" title="Duga radar">
<text>Duga (, ) was an over-the-horizon radar (OTH) system used in the Soviet Union as part of its early-warning radar network for missile defense. It operated from July 1976 to December 1989. Two operational &quot;duga&quot; radars were deployed, with one near Chernobyl and Liubech in the Ukrainian SSR, and the other in eastern Siberia.

The &quot;duga&quot; system was extremely powerful, reaching over 10MW, and emitted in the shortwave radio bands. It was given the nickname Russian Woodpecker by shortwave listeners for its emissions randomly appearing and sounding like sharp, repetitive tapping noises at a frequency of 10Hz. The random frequency hops often disrupted legitimate broadcasts, amateur radio operations, oceanic, commercial, aviation communications, and utility transmissions, resulting in thousands of complaints from many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some communications receivers began including &quot;Woodpecker Blankers&quot; in their circuit designs.

The unclaimed signal was a source of speculation, giving rise to theories such as Soviet brainwashing and weather modification experiments. However, because of its distinctive transmission pattern, many experts and amateur radio hobbyists realized it was an over-the-horizon radar system. NATO military intelligence had already given it the reporting name &quot;STEEL WORK&quot; or &quot;STEEL YARD&quot;, based on the massive size of the antenna, which spanned in length and in height. This massive structure formed a phased array and was necessary in order to provide high gain at HF as well as facilitating beam-steering, though it is unconfirmed whether the latter was actually used in normal operation. While the amateur radio community was well aware of the system, the OTH theory was not publicly confirmed until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

== History ==

===Genesis===
The Soviets had been working on early-warning radar for their anti-ballistic missile systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been line-of-sight systems that were useful for rapid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early warning satellite network was not well developed. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would help solve this problem, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.

The first experimental system, Duga, was built outside Mykolaiv in Ukraine, successfully detecting rocket launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome at . This was followed by the prototype Duga, built on the same site, which was able to track launches from the far east and submarines in the Pacific Ocean as the missiles flew towards Novaya Zemlya. Both of these radar systems were aimed east and were fairly low power, but with the concept proven, work began on an operational system. The new Duga-1 systems, built in 1972, used a transmitter and receiver separated by about .

===&quot;Russian Woodpecker&quot;===
At some point in 1976, a new and powerful radio signal was detected simultaneously worldwide, and quickly dubbed &#x27;the Woodpecker&#x27; by amateur radio operators. Transmission power on some Woodpecker transmitters was estimated to be as high as 10MW equivalent isotropically radiated power. Even prior to 1976, a similar woodpecker-style interference is remembered by radio amateurs occurring in the high frequencies. As early as 1963, or before, radio amateurs were calling this &quot;the Russian Woodpecker&quot;. Little is known about the power levels or Russian designation but it was probably a forerunner of the Duga radar systems. It was also speculated at that time, at least among radio amateurs, that this was an over-the-horizon radar.

These signals even caused interference on 27MHz CB radios in the late ’60s and early ’70s, sometimes completely blocking even local communications in Portugal, for example, leading to the supposition of several megawatts of RF power transmission.

Triangulation by amateur radio hobbyists and NATO showed the signals came from a location in present-day Ukraine, at the time called the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (part of the USSR). Confusion due to small differences in the reports being made from various sources led to the site being variously located near Kyiv, Minsk, Chernobyl, Gomel or Chernihiv. All of these reports were describing the same deployment, with the transmitter only a few kilometers southwest of Chernobyl (south of Minsk, northwest of Kyiv) and the receiver about northeast of Chernobyl (just west of Chernihiv, south of Gomel). At one time there was speculation that several transmitters were in use.

The radar system was given the code 5Н32-West by the Soviets, and was set up in two closed towns, Liubech-1 held the two transmitters and Chernobyl-2 the receivers. Unknown to civilian observers at the time, NATO was aware of the new installation. A second installation was built near Komsomolsk-on-Amur, in Bolshya Kartel and Lian, but did not become active for some time.

===NATO reporting name===
The NATO reporting name for the Duga-1 is often quoted as STEEL YARD. Many online and several print references use this name. However some sources also use the term STEEL WORK (or STEEL WORKS). As any &quot;official&quot; sources using NATO Reporting Names are likely to be classified, establishing the true name will be difficult. The earliest found open source mention of a NATO Reporting Name for this system, a reference publication in print while the system was still active, unambiguously uses the term STEEL WORK.
Jane&#x27;s Information Group is an often quoted open source reference for information across several military fields and subjects. Their &quot;Jane&#x27;s Radar and Electronic Warfare Systems&quot;, several editions over a number of years, uses the term &quot;Steel Works&quot;.

===Civilian identification===
Even from the earliest reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an over-the-horizon radar, and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the Cold War. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to submarine communications. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed that Radio Moscow and other pro-Soviet stations were just as badly affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.

As more information about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each BPSK modulated pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence with properties much like Barker codes, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse. The auto-correlation of this pulse/sequence results in a single 100μs pulse 31 times the amplitude of the received sequence, giving a resolution of (the distance light travels in 50μs) and process gain of almost 30 dB. This system took advantage of pulse compression to increase the power of the received echoes thereby increasing the sensitivity and effective range. When a second Woodpecker appeared, located in eastern Russia, but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system&#x27;s pattern, this conclusion became inescapable. These further installations allowed for more precise pin-pointing of potential targets or missiles in multiple dimensions thanks in part to the properties of the Barker codes that allow for multiple radars operating on the same frequencies without significant interference.

In 1988, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) conducted a study on the Woodpecker signal. Data analysis showed a pulse repetition interval (PRI) of about 90ms, a frequency range of 7 to 19MHz, a bandwidth of 0.02 to 0.8MHz, and typical transmission time of 7 minutes.

The pulses transmitted by the Woodpecker had a wide bandwidth, typically 40 kHz. Their repetition frequencies were 10Hz, 16Hz and 20Hz with the most common frequency of 10Hz, while the 16Hz and 20Hz modes were rarely used.

===Jamming the Woodpecker===
To combat this interference, amateur radio operators attempted to jam the signal by transmitting synchronized unmodulated continuous wave signals at the same pulse rate as the offending signal. They formed a club called The Russian Woodpecker Hunting Club.

===Signal disappearance===
Starting in the late 1980s, even as the FCC was publishing studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared. Although the reasons for the eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing strategic balance with the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s may have had a part to play. Another factor perhaps was the success of the US-KS early-warning satellites, which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.

According to some reports, the Komsomolsk-on-Amur installation in the Russian Far East was taken off combat alert duty in November 1989, and some of its equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the Zone of Alienation around the Chernobyl power plant. As of today , the radar appears permanently deactivated and will not likely receive future maintenance because such arrangements were not included as part of the 1992 Russian and Ukrainian talks; with regards to the Dnepr early warning radar systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol, most of the antenna still stands and is often used by radio amateurs who visit the area using their own portable radio equipment.

== Locations ==
The original Duga was the first experimental system. It was built outside the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, and successfully detected rocket launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome about away. Duga is able to track launches from the Far East and from submarines in the Pacific Ocean, as the missiles fly towards Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic Ocean. This huge radar complex was restored in 2002 after a fire seriously damaged it. The transmitter was located at and the receiver at . It appears that the original Duga transmit and receive sites near Mykolaiv, Ukraine were demolished in 2006.

The original Duga was supplanted by a pair of installations: western, Duga-1, and eastern, Duga-2. Duga-1 was built in northern Ukraine, between Liubech and Chernobyl-2. The receiver is located at , 12 kilometers west-north-west of Chernobyl; the transmitter is located at about northeast of Chernobyl (just west of Chernihiv, south of Gomel).

Duga-2, the eastern system, is located near Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Khabarovsk Krai, with the receiver at , some southeast of the city, and the transmitter at , north of the city.

== Media appearances==
The Ukrainian-developed computer game series &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; has a plot focused on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and the nuclear accident there. The game features many actual locations in the area, including the Duga-1 array. The array itself appears in &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky&quot; in the fictional city of Limansk-13. While the &#x27;Brain Scorcher&#x27; from &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot; was inspired by theories that Duga-1 was used for mind control, it does not take the form of the real array. However, in the 2024 entry of the series &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl&quot;, the site of the Duga-1 array is an explorable part of the map. In the story, the game&#x27;s &quot;Monolith&quot; faction attempts to use Duga-1 similarly to how the &quot;Brain Scorcher&quot; is used in &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot;.

Markiyan Kamysh&#x27;s book &quot;Stalking the Atomic City: Life Among the Decadent and the Depraved of Chornobyl&quot; depicts illegal trips to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, including to the Duga, and was praised by reviewers. TOP10 books of 2019 according to &quot;La Repubblica&quot; as one of the &quot;&quot;Constellations of the ten books that best reflect the spirit of the times&quot;.&quot; The Guardian called it a &quot;“remarkable book”.&quot;

In &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot;, the map &quot;Grid&quot; is placed in Pripyat near the Duga-1 array.
A game later in the series, &quot;Cold War&quot;, uses the duga as location for a possible final mission and as a map in the Zombies game-mode “Outbreak”, the map being appropriately named &quot;Duga&quot;. The said map has rappel lines that can take the player(s) up to the top or middle of the Duga, despite the actual radar array lacking this.

The Duga antenna array is also featured on the revised map &quot;Verdansk &#x27;84&quot; in the game Call of Duty: Warzone.

The &#x27;Russian woodpecker&#x27; appears in Justin Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Shipkiller&quot;.

The Duga at Chernobyl was the focus of the 2015 documentary film, &quot;The Russian Woodpecker&quot;, by Chad Gracia. The film includes interviews with the commander of the duga, Vladimir Musiets, as well as the Vice-Commander, the Head of the Data Center, and others involved in building and operating the radar. The documentary, which won numerous awards, also includes drone video footage of the array and handheld video footage of the surroundings as well as a climb to the top by the cinematographer, Artem Ryzhykov. The film also proposes a conspiracy theory that the Chernobyl disaster was engineered to cover up failures in the radar&#x27;s design.

The Duga radar is featured in the drone racing simulator Liftoff, as &quot;The Russian Woodpecker&quot;.

The Duga radar is also featured in the films of the &quot;Divergent&quot; series, where it was used as the giant wall and fence surrounding the main city. In wide shots, its structure was used to create computer-generated imagery of the superstructure and several close-up scenes were shot directly at its location.

A Duga radar is featured in the 2017 game &quot;&quot; in a map which portrays a fictional Russian Military base.

The Chernobyl DLC for the game &quot;Spintires&quot; features a representation of the sarcophagus and an antenna array similar in appearance to Duga.

The Duga radar is heavily featured in the virtual reality game &quot;Proze: Enlightenment&quot;, a suspense/puzzle game with the theory that the radar is being used by mind controlling experiments during the 1950-60s. The game actually starts with the player ascending one of the pylons on a maintenance lift.

A Duga radar is featured in the 2021 video game &quot;Chernobylite.&quot;

In episode 12 of the first season of the NBC science fiction series &quot;Debris&quot;, the Duga radar array makes an appearance as a fictional array in the state of Virginia.

The Chernobyl Duga site is featured in the Science Channel series &quot;Mysteries of the Abandoned&quot; (season 1, episode 1).

<text>Don Pyle is a Canadian record producer and musician, who has also been a member of multiple bands. Pyle is openly gay.

==Life and career==
Pyle&#x27;s first group was a punk band called Crash Kills Five, which was active from 1979 to 1981. Crash Kills Five released one EP in 1980, titled &quot;What Do You Do At Night?&quot;. It was in this four piece band that Pyle first played with two members, Reid Diamond and Brian Connelly, who would later become his bandmates in Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet. Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet were together for eleven years; during this time, they recorded three LPs and thirteen EPs and became widely known when the song &quot;Having An Average Weekend&quot; became the theme for the Canadian sketch comedy television series &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;. The band also won a Juno Award for Instrumental Artist of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1992. Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet also recorded with B-52s vocalist Fred Schneider for his solo album &quot;Just Fred&quot;.

Pyle also played with several other bands such as King Cobb Steelie and Fifth Column while on hiatus from Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet. During these periods he began producing recordings for other bands, including the debut single and LP by King Cobb Steelie and a record by Phleg Camp. After Shadowy Men broke up in 1994, he and Reid Diamond then formed the band Phono-Comb with Dallas Good for the express purpose of playing and recording with Jad Fair. After releasing one single and an LP, Fair returned to solo performing, and the trio released another single. Beverly Breckenridge of Fifth Column then joined the group to play bass and the quartet recorded the LP &quot;Fresh Gasoline&quot; for Quarterstick/Touch and Go Records, with Steve Albini producing.

After Phono-Comb broke up, Pyle began a new musical project with Andrew Zealley called Greek Buck. More experimental than his previous outfits, Greek Buck was noted primarily for their soundtrack compositions, such as those composed for films directed by John Greyson including &quot;The Law of Enclosures&quot; (1999) and &quot;Proteus&quot; (2003), Sarah Polley&#x27;s film &quot;I Shout Love&quot;, and most famously, the theme song of the series &quot;Queer As Folk&quot;.

In April 2007, Pyle launched his &quot;Trouble in the Camera Club&quot; photography show at The Beaver Cafe/bar in Toronto. The extensive collection of photographs documented the birth of the punk music scene in Toronto clubs during 1976–1980. An on-line version of the show was available on his official website.

&quot;Trouble in the Camera Club&quot; was published as a photo and essay book by ECW Press in 2011 and included over 300 photographs of Toronto punk bands such as Viletones, and Teenage Head. His photos of international artists include Iggy Pop, Ramones, Dead Boys, The Heartbreakers, Vibrators and The Troggs.

As a producer, music recorder, and mixer, his credits include releases by The Sadies, Iggy Pop, Peaches, John Doe, Andre Williams, and others. He composed and produced music for films by Ron Mann, Sarah Polley, and John Greyson as well as composing and/or producing music for The Inside Out Film and Video Festival, TV Ontario, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Den&quot;, and others.

In 2012 and 2013, Pyle released recordings by his two bands. The Filthy Gaze of Europe, his collaboration with Dallas Good, had a 7&quot; released by Ugly Pop records, with vocals by Damian Abraham, and Chris Colohan, with cover art by G. B. Jones. Black Heel Marks released an album called Feel Free in June 2013 that included Pyle in collaboration with Tacoma rock band Girl Trouble, Sandro Perri, and others.

<text>Behzti (Punjabi ਬੇਇੱਜ਼ਤੀ, &quot;Dishonour&quot;) is a play written by the British Sikh playwright Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti. The play sparked controversy in the United Kingdom in December 2004. A controversial scene set in a Gurdwara (Sikh temple) included scenes of rape, physical abuse and murder, with some members of the Sikh community finding the play deeply offensive to their faith. On the opening night, 18 December 2004, at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (The Rep), in Birmingham, England, a protest was organised by local Sikh leaders which turned violent, with the Rep cancelling performances of the play two days later. The case became part of a wider discussion in Britain about the limits of free speech and whether this can be curtailed where it offends the faith of religious groups.

==Plot==
The plot revolves around the elderly Balbir and her daughter Min who have a difficult and tempestuous relationship. Though both Sikhs, they have been largely ostracised from the local Sikh community following the suicide of Balbir&#x27;s husband Tej some years before. Seeking to secure her daughter&#x27;s future, Balbir presses Mr Sandhu, a respected figure in the local gurdwara, to look into potential marriage partners for her daughter. Subsequently, it emerges that Mr Sandhu had been conducting a gay affair with Tej, and that Tej had killed himself out of shame that it would be revealed. Mr Sandhu goes on to rape Min in the gurdwara, though this is covered up by others in the temple. Balbir later kills Mr Sandhu with a kirpan, and Min forms relationship with Elvis, her mother&#x27;s black care-worker.

==Cancellation ==
The opening night performance on 18 December 2004 was cancelled after violence erupted among protesters gathered around the theatre. Three people were arrested for public order offences and three police officers were injured. The Sikh protest organizers stated that they did not support the violence of a minority of protesters, and stated they would be happy to see minor changes in the script so that the play was not set in a Sikh gurdwara.

Sewa Singh Mandla, organiser of the protest and chairman of the Council of Sikh Gurdwaras in Birmingham, stated:

&quot;In a Sikh temple, sexual abuse does not take place, kissing and dancing don&#x27;t take place, rape doesn&#x27;t take place, homosexual activity doesn&#x27;t take place, murders do not take place.&quot;
On 20 December 2004, after an emergency meeting of the theatre management and discussions involving the local Sikh community, West Midlands Police and the Commission for Racial Equality, The Rep decided to cancel the play.

==Response to protest and cancellation==
Supporters of the play said the cancellation was an affront to freedom of speech. More than 700 arts figures, including Prunella Scales, Tariq Ali, Terry Jones, Andrew Motion, Jude Kelly, Richard Eyre, Ayub Khan-Din, Willy Russell, Jonathan Coe, Sheila Hancock, Timothy West, and Samuel West signed a letter in support of the playwright. The letter read, in part:

&quot;We all have the right to protest peacefully if a work of art offends us. We do not have the right to use violence and intimidation to prevent that work of art from being seen by others.&quot;

Gurharpal Singh, professor of inter-religious relations at the University of Birmingham, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, criticised the protestors for promoting an essentially outdated view of Sikhs rooted in the concerns of early Sikh migrants rather than the modern British-born Sikh youth, and the Labour government of Tony Blair as backing the &quot;promotion of religion in public life&quot;, ignoring internal tensions in communities and stifling dissent.
The author responded &quot;Religion and art have collided for centuries, and will carry on doing battle long after my play and I are forgotten. The tension between who I am, a British-born Sikh woman, and what I do, which is write drama, is at the heart of the matter. These questions of how differences in perspective and belief are negotiated in Britain today will, I hope, continue to bring about a lively and vital debate.&quot;

Stephen Glover, writing for &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, as reported by The Skih Times, commented that while deploring censorship, he did feel a &quot;degree of sympathy for the Sikhs&quot;, and found it hard &quot;not to admire&quot; the defence of their beliefs.

Sarita Malik, writing for ArtsProfessional magazine, noted that the reaction to Behzti showed a sharp divide between minorities and the art community.

One protester, Pritpal Singh, unsuccessfully appealed his conviction, arguing that the assembly was legal and that his rights were violated by the order to disperse. Lady Justice Hallett, speaking for the majority, said the defendant&#x27;s claim failed to address the rights of those who were frightened or endangered by the protest.

==Reception==
Jasdev Singh Rai, director of the Sikh Human Rights Group, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, criticised the play as sensationalist. He stated that &quot;the gurdwara is where the [Sikh holy book] Guru [Granth Sahib] is in residence, and therefore has a different significance than a synagogue, a church or a mosque&quot; and that by depicting a rape there Bhatti &quot;disrespected the sanctity of the Guru.&quot; Rai defends the &quot;subjective inscrutability of sacred icons&quot; and cites the work of Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault in their criticisms of &quot;the constructed paradigms of rationalism&quot;. He states that &quot;freedoms are never absolute, least of all in multicultural, multiracial societies where responsibilities to co-exist must limit them&quot; and concludes that &quot;the legacy of colonialism lingers, now disguised as a defence of &#x27;free speech&#x27;. Ironically, it finds its most xenophobic expression among liberals.&quot;

Helen Cross, writing in &quot;The Birmingham Post&quot;, described Behzti as &quot;a terrific new play&quot;. She went on to say that it was &quot;offensive, and furious and bloodthirsty and angry in all the right places.&quot; She noted that much of the action took place in a Gurdwara, and described the play as a &quot;searing comedy&quot; that included rape, abuse, murder, but was &quot;hugely funny, touching and tremendously important.&quot; She further credited the writer&#x27;s ability to &quot;expose hypocrisy and pretence where they find it.&quot;

Christie Davies, in an essay published by the Social Affairs Unit, an NGO, noted that he had not seen the play, but that he had read it, and could &quot;imagine&quot; how it could be performed. Davies described it as a &quot;clumsy patch-work quilt with weak and hurried stitching.&quot;

&quot;Asians in Media&quot; magazine said of the play: &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for some witty and thought provoking drama then &quot;Behzti&quot; is definitely for you. Gurpreet&#x27;s new play is set in a Gurdwara (Sikh Temple) and explores a number of themes with a variety of interesting characters. &quot;

In 2005 &quot;Behzti&quot; won the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize for the best play written by a woman in the English language.

The play has been translated into French by Rudi Bekaert and performed in Brussels on 16 November 2005.
It was produced in Belgium and France in October–December 2006.
It was published (in French) by the theatre publishing house &quot;Les Solitaires Intempestifs&quot;.

Mohan Singh, a local Sikh community leader, said: &quot;When they&#x27;re doing a play about a Sikh priest raping somebody inside a gurdwara, would any religion take it?&quot;

The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham, Vincent Nichols, said the play was offensive to people of all faiths: &quot;The right to freedom of expression has corresponding duties to the common good. Such a deliberate, even if fictional, violation of the sacred place of the Sikh religion demeans the sacred places of every religion.&quot;

The cancellation of the play is discussed in Nigel Warburton&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;Free Speech: A Very Short Introduction&quot;, where he states that &quot;the effects of the storming of the theatre are far wider than the particular case: the danger of such episodes is that they cause writers to self-censor for fear of violence.&quot;

<text>Christopher Nolan (6 September 1965 – 20 February 2009) was an Irish poet and author. He was born in Mullingar, Ireland, but later moved to Dublin. He was educated at the Central Remedial Clinic School, Mount Temple Comprehensive School and at Trinity College, Dublin. His first book was published when he was fifteen. He won the Whitbread Book Award for his autobiography in 1987. He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters in the UK, the medal of excellence from the United Nations Society of Writers, and a Person of the Year award in Ireland.

Because of his cerebral palsy, he experienced quadriplegia since birth. He died due to choking on 20 February 2009.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Christopher Nolan was born to parents Joseph and Bernadette Nolan. He grew up in Mullingar, Ireland. Due to asphyxiation at birth, Christopher was born with permanent impairment of his &quot;nerve-signalling system, a condition he said is now labelled dystonia&quot;. Because of these complications, Nolan was born with cerebral palsy, and could only move his head and eyes. At the beginning of his life, people believed he was intellectually disabled, but his mother proved them wrong. Bernadette brought her son to see Dr. Ciaran Barry. He was a consultant of physical medicine and rheumatology who possessed a particular interest in children with cerebral palsy. Dr. Barry was attached to the Central Remedial Clinic. He played games with Christopher, the toddler, and in so doing noted the child anticipated his actions and informed his mother that he was of sound mind.

Due to the severity of the palsy, he used a wheelchair. In an interview, his father explained how, at the age of 10, he was placed on medication by Dr. Barry that &quot;relaxed him so he could use a pointer attached to his head to type.&quot; To write, Nolan used a special computer and keyboard; in order to help him type, his mother held his head in her cupped hands while Christopher painstakingly picked out each word, letter by letter, with a pointer attached to his forehead.

He communicated with others by moving his eyes, using a signal system. When he was young, his father told him stories and read passages from James Joyce, Samuel Beckett and D. H. Lawrence to keep his mind stimulated. His mother strung up letters of the alphabet in the kitchen, where she kept up a stream of conversation. His sister, Yvonne, sang songs and acted out skits. His mother stated that &quot;he wrote extensively since the age of 11 and went on to write many poems, short stories and two plays, many of which were published.&quot; Many of the writings described here by Nolan&#x27;s mother were compiled for his first publication, the chapbook Dam-Burst of Dreams.

===Mature work===
Upon becoming a teenager, Nolan received his education from the Central Remedial Clinic School, Mount Temple Comprehensive School and at Trinity College, Dublin. At the age of fifteen, he published his first book, a collection of poems titled &quot;Dam-Burst of Dreams&quot;. He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters in the UK, the medal of excellence from the United Nations Society of Writers, and a Person of the Year award in Ireland. He wrote an account of his childhood, &quot;Under the Eye of the Clock&quot;, published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press, which won him the UK&#x27;s Whitbread Book of the Year Award in 1987 at the age of 21. He soon dropped out of Trinity College to write a novel entitled &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; (1999).

Nolan spent more than a decade writing &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; the book is a multi-generational story of a dairy-farming family in Nolan&#x27;s native county of Westmeath. The story is seen through the eyes of the ageing mother. It was inspired, he told &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, by the image of &quot;an old woman holding up her skirts as she made ready to jump a rut in a field.&quot; A review of the book was done in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Maghan O&#x27;Rourke. She reviews the book and relates it to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, in the story, the protagonist leaves his mother in Ireland while he moves on to travel the world. Nolan however, gives the reader a version of the mother&#x27;s story. &quot;And so, in the end, one suspects that he wants Minnie&#x27;s good-natured, commonplace ways to stand as their own achievement, reminding us that life continues in the places left behind.&quot;

===Death===
While working on a new novel, on 20 February 2009, Nolan died suddenly, aged 43, in Beaumont hospital in Dublin, after a piece of salmon became trapped in his airway.

Irish president Mary McAleese, upon hearing the news, said:

Minister for Arts Martin Cullen TD reflected that people should draw inspiration from Nolan&#x27;s life. &quot;With grace and courage, and with the support of his family, he never gave up and he never gave in [...] His bold creativity has ensured a written legacy.&quot;

Nothing has been released from the book in progress in 2009 since his death.

==Writing==

===Publications===
Nolan&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Under the Eye of the Clock&quot; (published 1987), won the Whitbread Award and was named Book of the Year. Although an autobiography, it is narrated by a fictional character named Joseph Meehan who details Nolan&#x27;s life as a third-person biography. The book reveals the deep relationship between Nolan and his mother, whom he calls Nora. &quot;Under the Eye of the Clock&quot; shows how Nolan&#x27;s parents engaged him in conversation and outdoor activities like hiking and horseback riding. The book was a best-seller in Britain and the United States. Nolan&#x27;s writing style is often compared to James Joyce and Dylan Thomas. Critics also point out that Nolan&#x27;s distinct writing style omits articles and uses participle construction other than relative clauses.

Nolan wrote &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; (published 1999) in perspective of a country woman, Minnie O&#x27;Brien. The novel spans 80 years of Minnie&#x27;s life, cutting from present to past to show the individuality of a woman and a mother who is determined to save the family&#x27;s farm. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; appreciated &quot;Nolan&#x27;s soaring language and lilting alliterative style [which] suffuse [...] much of the book with a sense of the miraculous&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; found it &quot;richly – even baroquely – told [...] Nolan writes with verve.&quot;

&quot;Dam-Burst of Dreams&quot; (published 1981), provided Nolan critical acclaim that compared him to the works of W. B. Yeats and James Joyce. The collection was published four years after Nolan was administered Lioresal but some of the poems were written when Nolan was just 12 years old. The title of the collection emphasized the recurrent theme of the overflow and release of his mental intellect. The collection&#x27;s poems are heavy with alliteration and incorporate neologisms that draw from combinations of pre-existing root words.

===Influences and mentors===
Nolan often discouraged inquiries about his literary influences. During an interview, he once wrote: &quot;Everything is an influence to a person trapped in a nightmare!&quot; Nolan&#x27;s enthusiasm for literature however was largely attributed to his father&#x27;s appreciation of James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, and D. H. Lawrence. Every night his father would read him several passages from Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; and other literary works. Listening to such pieces not only kept Nolan stimulated but piqued his interest in writing his own poetry.

In a poetry competition hosted by the British Spastics Society, Nolan received praise from writer Edna Healey, wife of then Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey. As a judge of the competition, she was one of the early recognizers of Nolan&#x27;s writing abilities. Healey was later invited as a guest on the BBC program titled &quot;The World this Weekend.&quot; On the broadcast in response to the question &quot;what was the most impressive moment,&quot; she remarked that reading Nolan&#x27;s work: &quot;Was the highspot of my year.&quot;

When enrolling him for secondary school, Nolan&#x27;s family struggled to convince educators that Nolan would be able to function in a regular class setting. Mount Temple Comprehensive School headmaster John Medlycott believed it was possible to devise a set-up to accommodate Nolan:

Thanks to Medlycott, Nolan was accepted into Mount Temple and later was received by Trinity College, Dublin after Medlycott provided a personal recommendation.

==Pop culture==
Nolan&#x27;s life story and works have been referenced in several musical works. Rock band U2, whose members attended school with Nolan, wrote their song &quot;Miracle Drug&quot; (from &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;) about him.

Bono said of Nolan:
On R.E.M.&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Green&quot; album, the song &quot;The Wrong Child&quot; was inspired by Nolan&#x27;s memoir &quot;Under the Eye of the Clock&quot;. The song deals with a child who wishes to play with his peers outside but is instead laughed at. Throughout the song, the refrain &quot;I&#x27;m not supposed to be like this / But it&#x27;s okay&quot; is repeated several times.

Nolan was once approached by a Los Angeles film producer who was interested in making his biography into a movie. Nolan declined the offer and responded:

==Honours==
In 1988 he was made a member of Aosdána.

Every year, his secondary school Mount Temple Comprehensive School holds an award show in his honour. The &quot;Eye of the Clock Awards&quot; are hosted in the last week of school for all students. These awards are given to students for extraordinary efforts in school and are inspired by Nolan&#x27;s efforts in school.

<text>Hjalmar Rued Holand (October 20, 1872 – August 6, 1963) was a Norwegian-American historian and author. He was the author of a number of books and articles principally dealing with the history of Door County, Wisconsin, of the Upper Midwest, and with Norwegian-American immigration.

==Background==
Hjalmar Rued Holand was born in Høland, Akershus, Norway. Holand, at age 13, along with his older sister, Helene, immigrated to America to stay with an older brother and his wife, living in Chicago. Unhappy with the living arrangements, Holand left Chicago to stay with another sister, Annette Johnson, living in Wautoma, Wisconsin. He received his BA from the University of Wisconsin in 1898, earning his MA the following year. Holand was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in anthropology and cultural studies during 1950.

==Career==
Holand lived most of his life on a farm near Ephraim, Wisconsin. He was an early advocate of the now widely recognized realization that Vikings visited the New World in voyages that pre-dated Christopher Columbus. Holand also made an effort to confirm the authenticity of the Kensington Stone together with other rune stones and Viking relics found throughout North America. Holland also wrote a two volume history of Door County, Wisconsin, which was published in 1917 and founded and was the long-time president of the Door County Historical Society.

Holand is most frequently associated with his two volume history of Norwegian-American immigration. Holand spent many years collecting the stories as he traveled to various Norwegian-American settlements in the Upper Midwest. The results were &quot;De Norske Settlements Historie&quot; released in 1908 and &quot;Den Siste Folkevandring Sagastubber Fra Nybyggerlivet I Amerika&quot; published in 1930. Both were written and published in Norwegian. These works have subsequently been translated and published in English. The first was a partial translation released in 1978, and the second was a complete translation released in 2006.

<doc id="1305673" wikidata="Q7689074" url="?curid=1305673" title="Taverner's Bible">
<text>Taverner&#x27;s Bible, more correctly called &quot;The Most Sacred Bible is the holy scripture, the old and new testament, translated into English, and newly recognized with great diligence after most exemplars by Rychard Taverner&quot;, is a minor revision of Matthew&#x27;s Bible edited by Richard Taverner and published in 1539. First editions of Taverner&#x27;s Bible are extremely rare.

==History==
The successful sale of Matthew&#x27;s Bible, the private venture of the two printers Grafton and Whitchurch, was threatened by a rival edition published in 1539 in folio (Herbert #45) by &quot;John Byddell for Thomas Barthlet&quot; with Richard Taverner as editor. This was, in fact, what would now be called &quot;piracy,&quot; being Grafton&#x27;s Matthew Bible revised by Taverner, a learned member of the Inner Temple and famous Greek scholar. He made many alterations in the Matthew Bible, characterized by critical acumen and a happy choice of strong and idiomatic expressions.
His revision seems to have had little influence on subsequent translators, although a few phrases in the King James Bible can be traced to it. Daniell sums up its influence, &quot;indeed a version which had no influence&quot;.

It was not reprinted in its entirety. Quarto and octavo editions of the New Testament alone were published in the same year as the original edition, and the Old Testament was reprinted as part of a Bible in 1551. The Old Testament and Apocrypha were also issued by Day and Seres in five sections (Herbert #81, #82, #86, #87, #94) between 1549 and 1551.

<doc id="1305674" wikidata="Q1051575" url="?curid=1305674" title="Humppa">
<text>Humppa is a type of music from Finland. It is related to jazz and very fast foxtrot, played two beats to a bar ( or ). Typical speed is about 110 to 130 beats per minute. Humppa is also the name of a few social dances danced to humppa music. All dances involve bounce that follows the strong bass of the music. In Finnish, the word &quot;humppa&quot; can also be used for all social dancing. The name humppa was invented by Antero Alpola for a radio show in the 1950s. He picked it up from German Oktoberfest where the locals used the word to describe the playing of the band. The band probably used a tuba, as the sound of tuba on the first beat is like &quot;hump&quot;, the second beat coming as a &quot;pa&quot;. (The related German style is known as oompah.)

There are three different dances typically danced to humppa music, and they have existed long before the word &quot;humppa&quot; was coined. One form of Humppa dance is related to one-step, which arrived in Finland 1913. In this kind of humppa, both dancers take a step on each first beat (on &quot;hump&quot;) and progress to the direction of dance. This is danced making turns in closed position or making figures by changing various open positions. The second Humppa form is related to two-step, which came to Finland in 1910. This Humppa has some rhythm and movement from samba and waltz. A third form of dance, &quot;Nilkku&quot;, is based on a slow, slow, quick, quick rhythm. The first quick step hardly takes any weight and gives the dance an appearance of limping.

In early 1970s pop music and dancing alone almost killed social dancing, but revival of humppa since mid-1970s keeps the traditional social dancing alive.

The revival meant that humppa had become the most popular music and dancing form for older people and also for countryside&#x27;s youth in the Eastern and South-Eastern parts of the country. Most popular humppa artists from the 1970s include male singers Erkki Junkkarinen, Henry Theel, Mikko Järvinen, Eino Valtanen, Eero Aven, female singers , Eija-Sinikka, and bands Tulipunaruusut, Kaisa &amp; Kumppanit and Mutkattomat. The most popular humppa event were probably Humppa festivals of Lappeenranta.

<doc id="1305677" wikidata="Q731528" url="?curid=1305677" title="Askesian Society">
<text>The Askesian Society — was a debating club for scientific thinkers in London (1796-1807). The name was taken from the Greek term &quot;Askesis&quot;, meaning &#x27;training&#x27; or &#x27;application&#x27;.

== History ==
Founded on 23 March 1796 in London.

It was founded by William Allen, who allowed the use of his laboratory at No. 2 Plough Court for the society&#x27;s scientific experiments. The other two principal founders were Richard Phillips and William Haseldine Pepys, both Quakers from the Lombard Street area.

The club was formed to fill the void after the departure of Bryan Higgins and his chemistry lectures.

Members had to present a paper or pay a fine, which led to Luke Howard&#x27;s 1802 presentation &quot;On The Modification of Clouds&quot;, which established the still used terms &quot;stratus,&quot; &quot;cumulus,&quot; and &quot;cirrus.&quot;

They often held theatres for &quot;laughing gas evenings&quot;, where members would watch as fellows would sup nitrous oxide and stumble around the stage.

The Society disbanded in 1807, with many of its members going on to join the Mineralogical Society, the Geological Society, the Linnean Society and the Royal Society of London.

<text>William Allen (29 August 1770 – 30 September 1843) was an English scientist and philanthropist who opposed slavery and engaged in schemes of social and penal improvement in early 19th-century England.

==Early life==
Allen was born in 1770, the eldest son in the Quaker family of Job Allen (1734–1800), a silk manufacturer, and his wife Margaret Stafford (died 1830). He was educated at a Quaker school in Rochester, Kent, and then went into his father&#x27;s business. As a young man in the 1790s, he became interested in science. He attended meetings of scientific societies, including lectures at St. Thomas&#x27;s Hospital and Guy&#x27;s Hospital, becoming a member of the Chemical Society of the latter establishment. On Job Allen&#x27;s death, the family silk firm was taken over by his father&#x27;s assistant.

Allen had concentrated on his own career in the field of pharmacy, taking over the Plough Court chemical business of Joseph Gurney Bevan who retired in 1795. In 1802, he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society and lectured on chemistry at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. A year later he was made president of the Physical Society at Guy&#x27;s, and on the advice of Humphry Davy and John Dalton also accepted an invitation from the Royal Institution to become one of its lecturers.

In 1807, Allen&#x27;s original research (on carbon) enabled him to be successfully proposed for election to Fellowship of the Royal Society, bringing him into contact with those who were publishing much of the original scientific research of the day. This strengthened his ties with the eminent Humphry Davy, and in due course with his long-standing friend Luke Howard, who was likewise elected to Fellowship of the Royal Society, though some years later.

Allen was known in commerce for his pharmaceutical company at 2 Plough Court, trading in 1795 as Mildred &amp; Allen while he was in partnership with Samuel Mildred. It was situated off Lombard Street in London. In 1797, Allen brought in Luke Howard as a partner. A later partner was Daniel Bell Hanbury, father of the botanist Daniel Hanbury. By 1856, the company had become Allen &amp; Hanburys. It was acquired in 1958 by Glaxo Laboratories, who retained the Allen &amp; Hanburys name as a separate marque within the GSK group.

Allen strengthened the company&#x27;s links with medical institutions, particularly Guy&#x27;s Hospital, where he was elected to its Physical Society. Using Plough Court for meetings, he also co-founded the Askesian Society. There new ideas for research and experimentation could be discussed with others such as Luke Howard, Joseph Fox, William Hasledine Pepys, William Babington, and the surgeon Astley Cooper. A second laboratory was opened for the development of new chemicals, a few miles away in Plaistow.

In 1841, Jacob Bell pressed for a professional body for pharmacists. Allen co-founded The Pharmaceutical Society, which later became &quot;The Royal Pharmaceutical Society&quot;. He was its first president.
==Abolitionist==
As a teenager, under the influence of Quaker abolitionists, Allen gave up sugar as a reaction to the Atlantic slave trade and abstained from it until 1834. He became interested in the politics of abolitionism in 1790/1, and in 1792, made a speech on the topic at the Worshipful Company of Coachmaker&#x27;s Hall. The speech was published as a pamphlet by Martha Gurney, which was influenced by writer William Fox. In 1794, he befriended Thomas Clarkson.

In 1805, after some years of assisting the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, William Allen was elected to its committee. The group had always been strongly influenced by Quakers, and particularly by those based in or near London. All the members of its predecessor committee (1783–1787) had been Quakers, and nine of the twelve founders of the subsequent non-denominational Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade were Quakers, including two – Samuel Hoare Jr and Joseph Woods Sr (father of the botanist Joseph Woods Jr) – who lived close to William Allen in Stoke Newington, the village near London where Allen had family interests after his second marriage in 1806.

Perhaps the best known committee member of the new non-denominational abolition society, founded in 1787, was William Wilberforce, who, unlike its Quaker members, was eligible as an Anglican to be elected to, and sit in, the House of Commons. Wilberforce visited William Allen at his experimental gardens on several occasions in his role as the Society&#x27;s parliamentary representative. He had long been familiar with the village, owing to family connections. His sister Sarah had married the lawyer James Stephens, whose family home was the Summerhouse, a large house adjoining Abney Park in the very grounds of the mansion that later, in the 1820s, was to become Allen&#x27;s novel girls&#x27; school.

William Allen was also a founder member and a Director of the African Institution, the successor body to the Sierra Leone Company, sponsored by philanthropists to establish a colony in West Africa for slaves freed on a voluntary basis, through the abolitionists&#x27; efforts, in America. The work of the successor body began in 1808, when the colony had been handed to the Crown in return for the British Parliament passing legislation for its protection at about the same time as the passing in 1807 of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade.

Allen&#x27;s active interest in the abolitionist cause continued until his death. In the mid-1830s he was passionate about abolition of the apprenticeship clause, and achieving the complete freedom of African-Caribbean people on 1 August 1838. His biographer, James Sherman, records, &quot;the apprenticeship clause in the Bill... had been greatly abused by the planters. Mr Allen was indefatigable in his efforts, by interviews with Ministers and official persons.. His account of the spirit-stirring time is graphic:&quot;
: &quot;The cruelty and oppression of the planters of Jamaica, as exercised on those poor sufferers, whose redemption from slavery we have paid twenty millions, has been exposed in the face of day. The West Indies in 1837, the result of personal investigation by our friend Joseph Sturge, has created a great sensation... The Anti Slavery Associations in all quarters are in a high degree of excitement, and petitions are loading the tables of both Houses of Parliament, begging for the abolition of the apprenticeship clause, and the complete establishment of freedom...on the 1st of Eight Month, 1838.&quot;

In 1838, the Friends sent a party to France. Allen went with Elizabeth Fry and her husband, Lydia Irving, and Josiah Forster. They were there on other business but despite the language barrier Fry and Irving visited French prisons.

In 1839, Allen became a founding Committee Member of the British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society for the Abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade Throughout the World, which is today known as Anti-Slavery International. In this role he was an organiser of, and delegate to, the world&#x27;s first anti-slavery convention, which was held in London in 1840 – an event depicted in a large painting by Benjamin Haydon that hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

==Pacifist==
Allen made an approving note in his diary, during 1798, on a pacifist tract, &quot;The Lawfulness of Defensive War upon Christian Principles Impartially Considered&quot;. It was by &quot;A Clergyman of the Church of England&quot;, on the basis of a later publication thought to be J. Bradley Rhŷs, but not further identified.&gt; In 1811, with the support of James Mill, he started a publication entitled &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;. It published articles by Mill and by Jeremy Bentham. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it printed peace petitions.

In 1814, about a month after Napoleon was exiled to Elba, a Peace Committee met at Allen&#x27;s house in Plough Court. A leading activist who attended was Joseph Tregelles Price. The idea of a &quot;peace association&quot; was in the air, supported by pseudonymous writers. One of those, certainly known to Allen, was the Unitarian William Pitt Scargill, associated also with Richard Phillips of &quot;The Monthly Magazine&quot;. In 1816, Allen became a founding member of the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace, after another meeting in his home. By 1823, however, his earlier trust in the Holy Alliance, and in particular Alexander I of Russia, to uphold peace in Europe, had given way to disillusionment.

==Other philanthropic works and interests==
Allen&#x27;s philanthropic work was closely allied to his religious beliefs, and began at an early age. In 1814 he became a partner in New Lanark. In the area of penal reform, prompted by Basil Montagu, he founded a Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge Respecting the Punishment of Death and the Improvement of Prison Discipline, in 1808.

===Nutrition and self-sufficiency===
In 1798 Allen set up a Soup Society in Spitalfields. His later interest in agricultural experiments was also aimed improving the nutrition and diet of ordinary people. Using only small plots, he carried out trials at Lordship Lane in Stoke Newington, and later put into practice some of his findings at the model agricultural settlement of Lindfield that he helped establish.

Allen&#x27;s self-sufficient settlement was described in detail in his pamphlet &quot;Colonies at Home&quot;, where he stated &quot;instead of encouraging emigration at enormous expense per head let the money be applied to the establishment of Colonies at Home and the increase of our national strength&quot;. At the time (1820s) the familiar colonies were in the Americas so the whole area became known as &quot;America&quot;. This identity remains in the local street names and people&#x27;s memories of the cottages in what is now America Lane.

===Education===
Allen was approached to help fund the ideas of Joseph Lancaster and his monitorial system, under which one teacher supervised several senior pupils, who in turn instructed many junior ones. In 1808 Allen, Joseph Fox and Samuel Whitbread co-founded the Society for Promoting the Lancasterian System for the Education of the Poor, from 1814 the British and Foreign School Society. In 1810 Allen became treasurer of the Society, whose aim was to open progressive schools in England and abroad.

In 1824 Allen founded the Newington Academy for Girls, also known as the Newington College for Girls, a Quaker school. The headmistress was Susanna Corder. Quaker views on women had from the beginning tended towards equality, with women allowed to minister, but still, at the time, girls&#x27; educational opportunities were limited. His school offered a wide range of subjects &quot;on a plan in degree differing from any hitherto adopted&quot;, according to the prospectus. Here Allen was able to ensure that the new sciences were covered (he taught astronomy, physics, and chemistry himself), as well as many languages. Allen hired Ugo Foscolo, a revolutionary and poet, to teach Italian. The school was situated at Fleetwood House and made much use of Abney Park, the grounds in which it sat. It was also innovative in commissioning the world&#x27;s first school bus, designed by George Shillibeer, to transport the pupils to Gracechurch Street meeting house on Sundays. The school was the subject of a poem by Joseph Pease, a railway pioneer who later became the first Quaker MP.

===Evangelism and travel===
From 1818 to 1820 Allen toured Europe with the Quaker evangelist Stephen Grellet. In 1818 they were in Norway. After his third wife&#x27;s death, Allen travelled extensively. In 1840, for example, he spent five months in Europe with Elizabeth Fry and Samuel Gurney.

==Family life==

William Allen married Mary Hamilton in 1796. They had a daughter, who bore the same name. The mother did not recover from the childbirth, and died just two days later.

In 1806, Allen married for the second time. His new wife, Charlotte Hanbury was born in 1762. The couple visited the continent in 1816, but Charlotte died during their travels, leaving him to bring up his adolescent daughter Mary. In 1823, Mary, who married another Cornelius Hanbury, gave birth to a son, but she died nine days later.

William Allen married for the third time in 1827. Grizell was the eldest sister of another family of well-off Stoke Newington Quakers, of whom the best-known is Samuel Hoare Jr (1751–1825), one of the twelve founding members of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. She had been nurse and companion to her father, a merchant in the City of London, and then married Wilson Birkbeck in 1801. As a wealthy widow, she contributed to the 1824 foundation of Newington Academy for Girls, and three years later she and William Allen, both co-founders of this novel educational establishment, married. She was 72, and the marriage was greeted by a satirical cartoon entitled &quot;Sweet William &amp; Grizzell-or- Newington nunnery in an uproar!!!&quot; by Robert Cruikshank.

Grizell Allen died in 1835.

==Death and memorial==
William Allen died on 30 December 1843 and was buried in Stoke Newington, London, in the grounds of the Yoakley Road Quaker Meeting House. Today this has been replaced by a Seventh-Day Adventist chapel, the other half of its grounds becoming a small Council-maintained park for the nearby public housing estate.

<doc id="1305686" wikidata="Q440061" url="?curid=1305686" title="Luke Howard">
<text>Luke Howard (28 November 1772 – 21 March 1864) was a British manufacturing chemist and an amateur meteorologist with broad interests in science. His lasting contribution to science is a nomenclature system for clouds, which he proposed in an 1802 presentation to the Askesian Society. Because of this, Howard is referred to as &quot;The Godfather of Clouds&quot;, the &quot;namer of the clouds&quot;, and the &quot;father of meteorology&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Luke Howard was born on 28 November 1772 in London to tin-plate manufacturer Robert Howard (1738–1812) and Elizabeth née Leatham (1742–1816). Howard attended a Quaker grammar school in Burford, Oxfordshire where the headteacher was renowned for his flogging of slow-to-learn pupils. In 1796 Howard married and They had two sons, Robert Howard and John Eliot Howard, who were ultimately to take over their father&#x27;s chemical manufacturing business, Howards and Sons. Their daughter Elizabeth married John Hodgkin, a barrister.

Although a Quaker, he quit the Society in 1825 after a dispute concerning apocryphal texts. A larger rift in the Society, the members being known as Beaconites being followers of Isaac Crewdson&#x27;s &quot;A Beacon to the Society of Friends&quot;, led to Howard&#x27;s final resignation from the Society in 1836. Howard was subsequently baptized into the Plymouth Brethren in 1837 by Crewdson.

Howard died on 21 March 1864 at 7 Bruce Grove, Tottenham and is buried at Winchmore Hill Quaker Meeting House in Enfield, north London.

==Career==
Luke Howard became a pharmacist by profession. After serving an apprenticeship with a pharmacist in Stockport, Cheshire, he worked at a druggist&#x27;s in Bishopsgate before setting up his own pharmacy in Fleet Street. In 1798, he began a partnership with fellow Quaker William Allen to form the pharmaceutical company of Allen and Howard. Howard operated the partnership&#x27;s factory built on the marshes at Plaistow, to the east of London. The partnership was ended in 1807 and Howard relocated his operations to Stratford East London. This factory soon became the successful industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals company later, 1856, known as Howards and Sons.

Howard was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821. In July 1838, Howard became an honorary member of the Societe Francaise de Statistique Universelle, the society founded by M Cesar Moreau (French Consul to London), of which the Royal Society was a member. Howard spent the years 1824 to 1852 in Ackworth, Yorkshire.

==Scientific work==
===Background===
Luke Howard has been called &quot;the father of meteorology&quot; for his comprehensive recordings of weather in the London area from 1801 to 1841 and his writings, which transformed the science of meteorology. Howard had an earlier interest in botany, presenting a paper &quot;Account of a Microscopical Investigation of several Species of Pollen, ...&quot; that was published in the Linnaean Society&#x27;s &quot;Transactions&quot; for 1802, but wrote to Goethe that his passion was for meteorology.

===Howard&#x27;s &quot;On the modification of clouds&quot;===
In his late twenties, Luke Howard wrote the &quot;Essay on the Modification of Clouds&quot;, which was published in 1803. Howard&#x27;s system was similar to the recently popularized Linnaean classification system developed by taxonomist Carl von Linne. Howard named the three principal categories of clouds – cumulus, stratus, and cirrus, as well as a series of intermediate and compound modifications, such as cirrostratus and cirrocumulus, in order to accommodate the transitions occurring between the forms. Howard&#x27;s classification system applied the recently popularized Linnean principles of natural history classification. By applying these principles to phenomena as short-lived as clouds, Howard arrived at an elegant solution to the problem of naming transitional forms in nature.

In his 1803 &quot;Essay&quot;, Howard included detailed cloud drawings to supplement the written descriptions of his classifications. The drawings of clouds were Howard&#x27;s own, taken from the rigorous notes and watercolor sketches in Howard&#x27;s sketchbook. However, the landscapes were done by painter Edward Kennion, as Howard had no formal artistic training. The engravings done by Thomas Milton for the publishing of Howard&#x27;s essay slightly altered the depictions of the clouds.
Howard also emphasized the importance of clouds in meteorology:

&quot;Clouds are subject to certain distinct modifications, produced by the general causes which affect all the variations of the atmosphere; they are commonly as good visible indicators of the operation of these causes, as is the countenance of the state of a person&#x27;s mind or body&quot;.

Howard strongly believed that &quot;cloud formation and destruction were visible signs of atmospheric processes and were based on the laws of physics&quot;. Howard referred to cloud formation as &quot;nubification&quot;, a term that was never popularized. Howard had the same elementary knowledge of cloud physics as many other researchers at the time, including his close friend and chemist John Dalton. Some of this knowledge was generally correct, like Howard and Dalton&#x27;s belief that clouds were formations of water particles, that the slow speed of the particles&#x27; descension was due to air resistance, and that they evaporated right below the cloud base. Howard, however, held some incorrect beliefs about cloud physics. Primarily Howard gave electricity too large a role in the formation of clouds. The knowledge Howard had about cloud physics partially formed his motives for creating a classification system.

===Other cloud classification systems===
Howard was not the first to attempt a classification of clouds—biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) proposed a list of descriptive terms in French the same year that Howard presented his essay, containing five terms, four of which overlapped with Howard&#x27;s system. The two were not known to have any contact, Lamarck working independently in France, and Howard working independently in England. Despite being presented in the same year, Howard&#x27;s system gained popularity quickly and became far more widespread than Lamarck&#x27;s. Howard&#x27;s system&#x27;s success has been said to be due to Howard&#x27;s use of universal Latin, the Linnaean classification system, and his emphasis on the mutability of clouds. Lamarck&#x27;s system, however, used French terms and opted for descriptive terms as opposed to a classification system like Linnaeus&#x27;. Lamarck&#x27;s essay proposing his system contained no pictures and was published in an obscure academic journal. Additionally, Napoleon publicly denounced Lamarck&#x27;s meteorological work, and Lamarck&#x27;s system was never well known within his own country.

===Later meteorological work===
In addition to his seminal work on clouds, Howard contributed numerous papers on other meteorological topics. He was also a pioneer in urban climate studies, publishing the earliest scientific book on urban climatology, &quot;The Climate of London&quot; in 1818–20, a 700-page book including continuous daily observations of wind direction, atmospheric pressure, maximum temperature, and rainfall; it also demolished James Hutton&#x27;s theory of rain, though without suggesting a definitive alternative. In it, Howard was first to note the urban heat island effect, showing that temperatures in London, compared to those simultaneously measured in the surrounding countryside, were 3.7 °F (2.1 °C) warmer at night, and cooler during the day, and to attribute the concentration of smog (which he called &#x27;city fog&#x27;) to this phenomenon. For &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; he contributed articles on meteorology, but the titles are not known.

Luke Howard also published the first textbook in meteorology in 1837, &quot;Seven Lectures in Meteorology&quot;. In the fifth lecture, Howard included the same classification scheme he proposed in 1802, slightly changing his descriptions. Howard notes again the importance of cloud studies for meteorology in the introduction of his work, claiming clouds to be &quot;the subjects of grave theory and practical research...shewn to be governed, in their production, suspension, and destruction, by... fixed Laws&quot;.

==Legacy==
Howard&#x27;s classification of clouds was later adopted by Ralph Abercromby and Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson, who further developed and popularised the system laid out by Howard. Abercromby noted in a paper on the naming of clouds that to the Quaker Howard &quot;any name connected with heathen mythology was specially distasteful&quot;. 
Howard&#x27;s cloud classification had a major influence on the arts as well as on science. His original essay, &quot;On the Modification of Clouds&quot;, was translated into German and French in 1815. This allowed German writer and scholar Goethe to access the text. Goethe was entranced by Howard&#x27;s system, and he later wrote a series of poems in gratitude to him, including the lines (note: English translation):

Goethe also wrote to Howard (via one of Goethe&#x27;s English friends), requesting Howard&#x27;s autobiography and process in developing his classification system. Goethe also attempted to commission German painter Caspar David Friedrich for cloud studies based on Howard&#x27;s system, but Friedrich declined. However, Friedrich did begin a series of cloud studies later that year. Howard&#x27;s classification system, along with Goethe&#x27;s interest, resulted in a great artistic interest in clouds. Howard&#x27;s work is also rumored to have inspired Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;The Cloud&quot; and informed John Constable&#x27;s paintings and studies of skies, in addition to the writings and art of John Ruskin, who used Howard&#x27;s cloud classification in his criticisms of landscape paintings in &quot;Modern Painters&quot;.
Howard appears in a novel by French writer Stéphane Audeguy titled, &quot;La théorie des nuages&quot;, winner of the 2005 Prix de l&#x27;Académie. Published in the US in 2007 as &quot;The Theory of Clouds&quot;.

An English Heritage blue plaque dedicated to Howard at 7 Bruce Grove, Tottenham (the house in which he died, aged 91), states simply his fame as &quot;Namer of Clouds&quot;. Howard was actively involved in the development of a Tottenham religious meeting house with his son, John Eliot Howard. Originally known as Brook Street Meeting House, it is now the Brook Street Chapel found on Tottenham High Road.

Whilst Howard&#x27;s factory was located in Plaistow, he resided at The River House, 3, Blaker Road, Stratford. Howard&#x27;s observations of the changing skyscape as he travelled between his home and factory facilitated his recording and categorization of clouds and his other observations of nature. Town Planning consent for this property&#x27;s redevelopment was submitted in 2015.

His daughter Rachel founded a school in Ackworth, West Yorkshire, which also contains a Plymouth Brethren burial ground.

In 2018, Tottenham Hotspur FC club, located near his house in Bruce Grove, named viewing areas in honour of his cloud names at the top of its east and west stands of its new stadium. These, with panoramic views of the pitch and across London, were named &#x27;Stratus East&#x27; and &#x27;Stratus West&#x27; in recognition of Howard&#x27;s classifications of cloud formations.

In 2024, The Royal Mail released stamp honoring Howard.

<text>Vassøy is an island in Stavanger municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The island lies in the Storhaug borough, about northeast of the centre of the city of Stavanger in an archipelago. The islands of Roaldsøy, Bjørnøy, and Langøy lie to the west and the island of Lindøy lies to the southeast. Vassøy had 702 inhabitants (in 2016) who all live along the western shore of the island; the eastern side is more rugged and wooded. The island has a primary school with around 60 pupils.

The only access to the island is by private boats or the regular ferry route administered by Kolumbus that goes from Vassøy to the city centre. A bridge or tunnel connecting Vassøy to either Bjørnøy or Roaldsøy has been heavily debated, but a conclusion has not been set. Kolumbus has said that if this were to finish construction, then they will cease to continue their services available to the Vassøy population like they have already to other islands who have gotten bridges.

<doc id="1305698" wikidata="Q265634" url="?curid=1305698" title="Allen's test">
<text>In medicine, Allen&#x27;s test or the Allen test is a medical sign used in physical examination of arterial blood flow to the hands. It was named for Edgar Van Nuys Allen, who described the original version of the test in 1942.

An altered test, first suggested by Irving S Wright in 1952, has almost universally replaced the original method in contemporary medical practice. The alternative method is often referred to as the modified Allen&#x27;s test or modified Allen test.

==Method==
===Original test===
The original test proposed by Allen is performed as follows:
# The patient is asked to clench both fists tightly for 1 minute at the same time.
# Pressure is applied over the radial and ulnar arteries simultaneously so as to occlude them.
# The patient then opens the fingers of both hands rapidly, and the examiner compares the colour of both. The initial pallor should be replaced quickly by rubor.
# The test may be repeated, this time occluding the ulnar arteries.

===Modified test===
In the modified Allen test, one hand is examined at a time:
# The patient is asked to clench their fist for about 30 seconds.
# Pressure is applied over the ulnar and the radial arteries so as to occlude both of them.
# Still elevated, the hand is then opened. It should appear blanched (pallor may be observed at the finger nails).
# Ulnar pressure is released while radial pressure is maintained, and the colour should return within 5 to 15 seconds.

If color returns as described, Allen&#x27;s test is considered to be normal. If color fails to return, the test is considered abnormal and it suggests that the ulnar artery supply to the hand is not sufficient.

== Significance ==
The modified Allen&#x27;s test is also performed prior to heart bypass surgery. The radial artery is occasionally used as a conduit for bypass surgery, and its patency lasts longer in comparison to the saphenous veins. Prior to heart bypass surgery, the test is performed to assess the suitability of the radial artery to be used as a conduit. A result of less than 3 seconds is considered as good and suitable. A result of between 3–5 seconds is equivocal, whereas the radial artery will not be considered for grafting if the result is longer than 5 seconds.

The utility of the modified Allen&#x27;s test is questionable, and no direct correlation with reduced ischemic complications of radial artery cannulation have ever been proven. In 1983, Slogoff and colleagues reviewed 1,782 radial artery cannulations and found that 25% of them resulted in complete radial artery occlusion, without apparent adverse effects. A number of reports have been published in which permanent ischemic sequelae occurred even in the presence of a normal Allen&#x27;s test. In addition, the results of Allen&#x27;s tests do not appear to correlate with distal blood flow as demonstrated by fluorescein dye injections.

Further modifications to the test have been proposed to improve reliability.

<doc id="1305702" wikidata="Q1431348" url="?curid=1305702" title="Gary/Chicago International Airport">
<text>Gary/Chicago International Airport is a joint civil-military public airport in Gary, in Lake County, Indiana, United States. It is three miles northwest of the city center of Gary, and southeast of the Chicago Loop. It is operated by the Gary/Chicago International Airport Authority, which was created by an interstate compact between Gary, Chicago, and Indiana. Nearby highway connections include I-90, I-80, I-94, I-65 and the Chicago Skyway.

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 4,353 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 1,633 in 2009 and 2,143 in 2010. It is in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which called it a &quot;non-primary commercial service&quot; airport based on enplanements in 2008 (between 2,500 and 10,000 per year) but would be categorized as &quot;general aviation&quot; based on enplanements in 2010.

== History ==
Gary/Chicago bills itself as the &quot;third airport&quot; for the Chicago metropolitan area, supplementing Chicago&#x27;s major airports, O&#x27;Hare and Midway. Gary/Chicago Airport has been designed with an eye towards growth and the administration is courting airlines aggressively. Numerous businesses, including Boeing, Menards and White Lodging Services, base their corporate aircraft here. A National Guard installation has been built.

Federal funds were secured in January 2006 to move railroad tracks away from the northwest corner to allow extension of the main runway to 9,000 feet, as well as add gates to the existing passenger terminal building. The recent creation of the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority is expected to draw more state and local dollars for infrastructure improvements and additions.

Expanding Gary/Chicago Airport is an alternative to constructing a new airport near Peotone, Illinois, 30 miles south of Chicago. One advantage of expanding the Gary airport is its proximity to downtown Chicago. This plan is backed by the mayors of Gary and Chicago, while the Illinois state government is in favor of construction at Peotone. Tax revenues from a new airport at Peotone would go to the Illinois state government, while those from an expanded Gary airport would go to a regional airport authority and thus to the cities of Chicago and Gary.

A long-standing proposal to turn the Gary/Chicago International Airport into Chicago&#x27;s third major airport received a boost in early 2006 with the approval of $48 million in federal funding over the next ten years. Expansion plans include a new multi-level Intermodal Terminal combining three modes of transit – passenger rail, passenger vehicles and air travel. The rail system is designed to combine both commuter and high-speed lines.

High tension power lines along the west end of the airport are buried. A definitive agreement has been reached with the railroads that will allow relocation of elevated tracks currently blocking the west end of runway 30. Completion of these projects was required to make way for a lengthening of the main runway.

On the afternoon of March 22, 2013, the FAA threatened to close the airport&#x27;s control tower, along with other airports in Illinois as a part of Federal Budget sequestration in 2013. However, Allegiant Air planned to keep flying to Gary, resuming in May. The closure did not happen as planned.

The construction of the northwest extension of runway 12/30 from 7,003 to 8,859 feet was finally completed and opened for service on June 25, 2015.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Gary/Chicago International Airport covers 763 acres (309 ha) at an elevation of 597 feet (180 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt runways: 12/30 is 8,859 by 150 feet (2,700 x 46 m) and 2/20 is 3,604 by 100 feet.

In the year ending December 31, 2022, there were 114 aircraft based at this airport: 39 single-engine, 9 multi-engine, 53 jet, 6 helicopter, and 7 military.

The airport is also home to an Army Aviation Support Facility supporting UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter operations of the Indiana Army National Guard as well as an additional collocated Army National Guard Armory supporting additional Indiana ARNG units and personnel. The installation is located on the site of a former Cold War-era Army Nike missile battery.

An ex-US Airways Boeing 737-400 is stored at the airport. It is owned by the Ivy Tech College and used for various types of training.

== Passenger service history ==
The airport was once served by Pan Am, Southeast Airlines, SkyValue Airlines, Skybus Airlines and Hooters Air, with flights to cities such as Hartford, Connecticut; St. Petersburg, Florida; Greensboro, North Carolina and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Prior to its bankruptcy in 2008, ATA Airlines planned turboprop service to several Indiana cities by its subsidiary, Chicago Express/ATA Connection, but the service was never started as Chicago Express Airlines was grounded in March 2005. Before ultimately choosing to serve Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport in 2006, JetBlue Airways considered flights to Gary/Chicago.

Gary/Chicago was the hub for seasonal carrier SkyValue Airlines from December 2006 to April 2007.

Skybus Airlines served the airport until the airline folded on April 4, 2008. Between then and 2011, there were no scheduled passenger flights out of the Gary/Chicago Airport, but charter airlines frequently flew casino guests to Atlantic City, Harrah&#x27;s Tunica, and Beau Rivage Biloxi.

On December 12, 2011, Allegiant Air announced it would begin service to Orlando Sanford International Airport two days a week beginning February 15, 2012. Allegiant Air had considered Gary/Chicago International Airport before, but aircraft operational limits resulted in the airline deciding against Gary until the runway expansion was completed.

On May 24, 2013, Allegiant Air reported it was cancelling air service out of Gary because of low demand for the flights. Airport officials said that passenger loads were consistently more than Allegiant Air&#x27;s minimums, but Allegiant Air said that the flights did not meet its revenue model. Allegiant Air&#x27;s final scheduled flight from Gary was on August 10, 2013. Since Allegiant Air ended scheduled flights, there has been no scheduled commercial passenger airline service out of Gary Airport.

On May 13, 2020, announced it was adding its express parcel services to Gary/Chicago International Airport using the Airbus A300 and Boeing 757 to and from Louisville International Airport, home to UPS WorldPort. Flights commenced on November 2, 2020.

On September 14, 2022, the airport authority hired the consulting firm Mead &amp; Hunt to perform the necessary steps to re-attract passenger service. On July 18, 2023, the airport&#x27;s executive director released plans for bringing back passenger service. Commercial flights were expected to resume in late 2023 or early 2024 but did not due to pilot shortage and aircraft delivery issues. According to the director, &quot;...as soon as the industry catches up with aircraft deliveries, we&#x27;ll see commercial service return here to the airport.&quot;

==Airlines and destinations==
===Cargo===
== Activity ==
Chicago-based Boeing selected the airport to permanently base its Midwest corporate jet fleet.

For many years airplanes seen in the Chicago Air &amp; Water Show have flown from here, including the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s C-5 Galaxy and the F-16 flight demonstration aircraft of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds. Since 1999, the Gary Air Show has based its operations here as well.

== Ground transportation ==
The South Shore Line commuter rail train serves the Gary/Chicago International Airport. The station, which is known as Gary/Chicago Airport, is located near Second Avenue, approximately south of the terminal. Service runs to downtown Chicago.

<doc id="1305703" wikidata="Q3622301" url="?curid=1305703" title="Beck's triad (cardiology)">
<text>Beck&#x27;s triad is a collection of three medical signs associated with acute cardiac tamponade, a medical emergency when excessive fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac around the heart and impairs its ability to pump blood. The signs are low arterial blood pressure, distended neck veins, and distant, muffled heart sounds.

Narrowed pulse pressure might also be observed. The concept was developed in 1935 by Claude Beck, a resident and later Professor of Cardiovascular Surgery at Case Western Reserve University.

==Components==
The components are:
# Hypotension with a narrowed pulse pressure
# Jugular venous distention (JVD)
# Muffled heart sounds

==Physiology==
The rising central venous pressure is evidenced by distended jugular veins while in a non-supine position. It is caused by reduced diastolic filling of the right ventricle, due to pressure from the adjacent expanding pericardial sac. This results in a backup of fluid into the veins draining into the heart, most notably, the jugular veins. In severe hypovolemia, the neck veins may not be distended.

==Clinical use==
Although the full triad is present only in a minority of cases of acute cardiac tamponade, presence of the triad is considered pathognomonic for the condition.

<doc id="1305725" wikidata="Q7382487" url="?curid=1305725" title="Rustic Overtones">
<text>Rustic Overtones is an American rock band from Maine, United States, active between 1993 and 2002 and from 2007 to the present. They were the first group to perform live on XM Satellite Radio, and their 2007 album &quot;Light at the End&quot; was the fastest-selling local disc ever in the state of Maine.

==History==

===Early years: 1993–2002===
Rustic Overtones started in the early 1990s as a three-piece cover band known as Aces Wild with Dave Gutter, Jon Roods, and then-drummer and close friend Matthew Esty, playing small bars. This lineup produced the very rare &quot;Smile&quot; album. Rustic Overtones gained popularity during the mid to late 1990s in the Portland, Maine, music scene, although it had many self-financed tours throughout the country, mostly the northeastern states. After the release of the band&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Rooms by the Hour&quot;, major record label Arista signed the band spurred on by then-president Clive Davis. The signing led to &quot;Hardest Way Possible,&quot; a song from &quot;Rooms By The Hour&quot;, being featured on the soundtrack of the Rob Schneider film &quot;The Animal&quot;. Arista hired legendary producer Tony Visconti to produce what became the band&#x27;s 2001 release, &quot;¡Viva Nueva!&quot; However, after disagreements with the label, and a shakeup at Arista that saw the band&#x27;s primary supporter, Clive Davis, depart, the record deal fell through. The band was shortly picked up afterward by Tommy Boy and released the album in 2001, which featured guest appearances by Funkmaster Flex, Imogen Heap, and David Bowie. However, Tommy Boy&#x27;s deal with Warner Bros. Records ended in 2002, which once again left the band without a record label. The disappointment of two major record deals falling through proved too much for the band members, and they went their separate ways in 2002. Its final performance was a three-hour show at the State Theatre on May 11, 2002.

===Break-up and solo careers: 2002–2007===
During the five years that the Rustic Overtones went their separate ways, most of the band members pursued a side project. Dave Gutter and Jon Roods met up with one-time Overtones drummer Marc Boisvert, and formed Paranoid Social Club, another band that enjoyed success, with its single &quot;Wasted&quot; appearing in the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Beerfest&quot;. Spencer Albee joined with other local musicians including guitarist Zach Jones, drummer Brian Higgins, and bassist Haché and formed Rocktopus (later As Fast As, replacing Higgins with drummer Andrew Hodgkins), whose album &quot;Open Letter to the Damned&quot; received a 4.5/5 rating from music critic giant Allmusic. Tony McNaboe served as a touring drummer for Ray LaMontagne, and released an R&amp;B solo album in 2003 entitled &quot;Destination&quot;. In addition, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis split his time between Lettuce and Soulive, baritone saxophonist Jason Ward played with several local bands, and trombonist Dave Noyes joined local group Seekonk.

===Reunion and &quot;Light at the End&quot;: 2007–2008===
In early spring of 2007, drummer Tony McNaboe began the process of reuniting the band, calling each former member separately, and telling them that everyone else had already agreed to a reunion. In May 2007, Tony McNaboe, Spencer Albee, and Jon Roods made a surprise announcement on Portland&#x27;s WCYY that the entire band did indeed plan to reunite, and were in the process of scheduling local reunion shows. On May 29, they announced that they would play two reunion shows at Portland club The Asylum, on July 28 and 29, 2007. In addition, after a month of rumors and gossip, the band also announced that they had been working on a new album of previously unreleased material and newly written music, eventually titled &quot;Light at the End&quot;, which was released independently in late July 2007 coinciding with the two reunion shows.

Although the band originally made it clear that the reunion would only last for the summer, and the members would turn their attention back to their post-Overtones projects after the two shows and the release of the album, Gutter confirmed in an article for the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; that &quot;reunions will become a regular thing&quot; and that the band is &quot;here to stay.&quot; Furthermore, during one of the band&#x27;s reunion shows, Spencer Albee proclaimed, &quot;we&#x27;re never going to leave you again, we&#x27;re sorry&quot;. Also, during an interview on a local news station on July 18, 2007, with Gutter and Albee, the two were asked what the future plans are with the band. Gutter responded with &quot;we&#x27;ve got a couple more huge endeavors planned for Rustic Overtones&quot; and Albee stated that &quot;there&#x27;s no reason to not be together&quot;.

On September 8, 2007, the band announced on their MySpace page that they were in the process of filming a &quot;feature film documentary,&quot; though they did not announce a release date or filming timetable. On November 24, 2007, Spencer Albee announced to the crowd at an Asylum concert that the band would soon re-release the albums &quot;Long Division&quot; and &quot;Light At The End&quot; on a national record label to get the albums out to the masses. Two days later, the band announced on MySpace that the label they had signed with was Velour Records, and hinted that their entire back catalog of albums would soon be released.

===Spencer Albee&#x27;s departure and &quot;The New Way Out&quot;: 2008–2009===
On September 17, 2008, the band unexpectedly announced on Myspace that Spencer Albee, their keyboardist since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Long Division&quot;, had left the band. Drummer Tony McNaboe explained that Spencer was parting ways on good terms, and that work on a new album would continue as planned with multi-instrumentalist Nigel Hall from Lettuce filling in on keyboards. Hall toured as a normal member of the band until he became too busy with other projects to continue as a full-fledged member, still contributing to the recording of the album. On tour the band began to alternate between Hall and Tyler Quist as keyboardists, playing some shows without a keyboardist at all, or having Ryan Zoidis and Dave Noyes take over keyboardist duties on certain songs. The band continued work on their album in their self-built studio, Limited Productions Limited, throughout 2008 and 2009, and on November 11, 2009, &quot;The New Way Out&quot; was released.

===Death of Noyes and &quot;Self Titled&quot;: 2019===
On February 23, 2019, the band posted a short clip of a song titled &quot;Black Shirt&quot; to their Instagram account with an announcement of their forthcoming album. On March 7, trombonist Dave Noyes died unexpectedly. Hailed as an essential member of the band, he was called the &quot;glue that held the band together.&quot; Multiple benefit shows were performed in his honor, as well as to raise funds for his bereaved pregnant wife and young child. On November 29, 2019, they released a self-titled album based on what Noyes had recorded before he died.

==Styles and influences==

In its earliest days, Rustic Overtones was mostly classified as a rock and soul band, citing as their heaviest influences artists such as Earth, Wind, and Fire and Tom Waits, and playing with a raw sound. However, by &quot;Rooms by the Hour&quot;, the band refined and diversified its sound, with much more of a jazz influence on songs such as &quot;Pink Belly&quot; and &quot;Machine Maker,&quot; and an alternative rock feel on songs such as &quot;The Heist&quot; and &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot;. By the late &#x27;90s and into the early 2000s, the band had become heavily influenced by hip hop, leading to the heavy production of the entire album, a collaboration with hip-hop veterans Naughty by Nature that appeared on the rap group&#x27;s 1999 album, and the &quot;¡Viva Nueva! &quot;song &quot;Smoke&quot;, which when played sometimes featured a guest rapper friend of the band who rapped over an extended outro to the song. Many believe that this radical switch of style contributed to the band&#x27;s fallout with their Arista record deal, as the company apparently believed that the band&#x27;s sound on the album would be similar to that of their older material. The album Light at the End sounds most similar to the production and style of &quot;Rooms by the Hour&quot;, although the album draws from various other phases of the band&#x27;s musical evolution as well.

<doc id="1305727" wikidata="Q4021211" url="?curid=1305727" title="X-Statix">
<text>X-Statix are a team of mutant superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team was specifically designed to be media superstars. The team, created by Peter Milligan and Mike Allred, first appears in &quot;X-Force&quot; #116 and originally assumed the moniker [[X-Force]], taking the name of the more traditional superhero team, who appear in #117 (June 2001) claiming to be &quot;the real X-Force&quot;.

==Publication history==
In 2001, the X-Men family of titles were being revamped by the newly appointed Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada. The aim was to make the titles more critically and commercially successful. Former Vertigo editor Axel Alonso hired writer Peter Milligan, best known for his surreal, post-modernist comics such as &quot;Rogan Gosh&quot; and &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot;, and &quot;Madman&quot; artist Mike Allred, as the new creative team for &quot;X-Force&quot;, starting with issue #116. Prior to Milligan and Allred&#x27;s first issue, &quot;X-Force&quot; sold well, but had not been the critical success Quesada wanted.

Milligan and Allred completely revamped the series, designing a team more akin to popstars or reality TV contestants than the gritty, violent paramilitary group originally portrayed in the series. The title was laced with Milligan&#x27;s satirical take on the superhero team as well as general cynicism toward the entire genre. Milligan wrote that he saw the characters&#x27; super powers as &quot;vehicles for exploring our celebrity and fame-obsessed society.&quot;

&quot;My mutants all have agents, negotiate fees for image rights, open megastores and live the dream. People die in my comic. We even have a character called Dead Girl.&quot;

Milligan and Allred would regularly play with killing off the title characters: In their first issue, they wiped out the entire team, with only two exceptions. This dramatic revision of the series was not universally accepted. Many readers wanted &quot;their&quot; X-Force back, a complaint Milligan later parodied in the pages of the title. Alonso described the series as &quot;a hostile takeover of the X-Men paradigm.&quot; However, the title was receiving mainstream media coverage in titles like &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

&quot;X-Force&quot; #116 was the first Marvel Comics title since &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #96–98 in 1971 to not have the Comics Code Authority (CCA) approval seal, due to the violence depicted in the issue. The CCA, which governed the content of American comic books, rejected the issue, requiring that changes be made. Instead, Marvel simply stopped submitting comics to the CCA.

&quot;X-Force&quot; was canceled with issue #129 in 2002 and renamed &quot;X-Statix&quot;; it restarted with a new issue #1. &quot;X-Statix&quot; carried on the same themes as &quot;X-Force&quot;, but with an increasingly satirical tone. Milligan planned to deploy Princess Diana as a character in a story-arc beginning in &quot;X-Statix&quot; #13: she was slated to return from the dead as a mutant superhero. However, when news of this leaked out to the media, a series of objections followed, most notably from the British tabloid newspaper &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;. A spokesperson for the British royal family called the planned story &quot;appalling.&quot; Milligan responded to the controversy, writing in the British daily newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Diana fit in well with X-Statix as someone &quot;famous for being famous&quot; and that he would like to write a story where David Beckham joined the team, if he could convince Marvel to let him. On July 10, 2003, Marvel announced that they would remove Princess Diana from the story, replacing her with a fictional pop star named Henrietta Hunter.

Although sales of the title during this time were moderate, they soon began to decline drastically. After a story-arc that pitted X-Statix against The Avengers, low sales prompted the title&#x27;s cancellation with issue #26, published in 2004. In the last issue Milligan and Allred killed off the entire team, serving up one last parody of the superhero genre, while tying up the remaining plot threads.

In 2006, Marvel Comics published the five-issue miniseries &quot;X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl&quot;, which featured Dead Girl teaming up with Doctor Strange to combat a group of villains who have returned from the dead. The series is written by Milligan, with covers by Allred. The storyline (which features the returns of the Anarchist, the Orphan, and U-Go Girl) parodies the manner in which creators in the industry handle death in comic books, with popular characters often brought back from the dead.

In 2019, &quot;Giant Sized X-Statix&quot; was published and written by Peter Milligan and Mike Allred the original creators of X-Statix. The title showcased a new version of the team consisting of the new U Go-Girl, Doop, Vivisector, Mister Sensitive, The A, and Phatty as well as a new team the X-Cellent with its members being Zeitgeist, Hurt John, Mirror Girl, and Uno and alumni/former members of X-Force like Plazm, the Anarchist, La Nuit, Battering Ram, and Gin Genie. In 2020, &quot;The X-Cellent&quot; was announced as a successor to &quot;X-Statix&quot;.

==Members==
X-Statix is a team of colorfully dressed and emotionally immature young mutants. They are assembled and marketed as superstars, first by the mysterious Coach, and later by media mogul Spike Freeman.

===Team===

*Anarchist / Tike Alicar, the team&#x27;s self-proclaimed &quot;token&quot; Black Canadian, whose acidic sweat enables him to fire energy bolts.
*Bloke / Mickey Tork, a mutant with the ability to change the color of his skin, like a chameleon.
*Dead Girl / Moonbeam, a mixture of ghost and zombie. Her civilian name has never been fully revealed, but she admitted after some cajoling that her first name is/was &quot;Moonbeam&quot;. Dead Girl&#x27;s mutant gene allows her to return to semi-life after dying; she is also able to become and communicate with other dead people.
*Doop, a green, floating spheroid creature of unknown origin, who speaks in a &quot;language&quot; all his own (represented in text by a special font), and serves as the team&#x27;s cameraman.
* Katie Sawyer / U-Go Girl II / Gone Gal, daughter of U-Go Girl and has the power of teleportation.
*El Guapo / Roberto &quot;Robbie&quot; Rodriguez, a sexy male mutant with a sentient flying skateboard.
*Henrietta Hunter, a female pop star who is inexplicably reanimated with enhanced physical abilities and empathy (This character was originally written as Diana, Princess of Wales, but Marvel decided to rewrite her when news of this plan caused controversy.)
*Mysterious Fan Boy / Arnie Lundberg, the self-proclaimed greatest fan of the X-Statix team. He is placed on the team so that his reality-warping powers and unstable personality can be monitored and controlled.
*Orphan / Mister Sensitive / Guy Smith, the team&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader, and a mutant with purple skin and two antennae protruding from his forehead. He possesses heightened senses, superhuman speed, and the ability to levitate, and must wear a special suit to protect his highly irritated skin.
*Phat / William Robert Reilly, a gay white man who can harden, soften, and increase the size of any part of his body by expanding his subcutaneous fat layer.
*Saint Anna, an Irish-Argentinian mutant with the ability to levitate and control the motion of objects as well as physically and mentally heal others.
*The Spike / Darian Elliot, an African American character who is capable of extending thin spikes from his body or launching them as projectiles.
*U-Go Girl / Edith Sawyer, a blue-skinned, redheaded, narcoleptic teleporter who was once romantically linked to Zeitgeist and then to Orphan.
*Venus Dee Milo / De Milo, whose body was made entirely of crackling red energy that allowed her to teleport, project concussive blasts of energy, and heal minor wounds.
*Vivisector / Myles Alfred, a bookish, gay scholar who can transform himself into a wolf-like creature with enhanced senses, speed, agility, and razor-sharp fangs and claws.

===Mentors===
*Coach, the manipulative mentor of the team while it was still operating as X-Force. He has only one arm and red eyes, hence nickname &quot;The Arm&quot;. Coach has the second X-Force team eradicated in order to start a new one.
*Spike Freeman, an amoral, 34 year old thrill-seeking billionaire/trillionaire, he assists the team by auditioning new members, and by managing its public relations.

===Allies===
*Lacuna / Woodstock Schumaker, a young girl named Woodstock who seeks to join the team, she has the power of time manipulation.
*Professor X, the mentor of the X-Men who assists X-Statix on some occasions. He constructs special suits to accommodate Orphan and Venus Dee Milo&#x27;s mutations.
*Wolverine, an old friend of Doop&#x27;s who helps Orphan take down Coach and his back-up team.
*O-Force, a mutant superhero team. Consisting of Overkill, Obituary, Ocean, Ocelot, Ooze and Orbit. Candidates include Ozone, Orchid, Optoman, Oink, Oracle and Orifice.

===X-Force===
In Milligan and Allred&#x27;s first issue of &quot;X-Force&quot;, nearly the entire team is killed off in an incident called the Boyz R Us Massacre. This precursory team, of which only U-Go Girl, Doop, and Anarchist survive, also included:

*Battering Ram, who has superhuman strength and durability as well as a thick skull which sported two ram-like horns and purple skin.
*Gin Genie / Beckah Parker, who can direct seismic energy from her body if she had consumed alcohol.
*La Nuit, a Frenchman who can generate a cloak of dark energy around him that disperses light and controls objects.
*Plazm, a living, lighter-than-air, liquid man who can control metabolic functions upon contact with another or through a spray from his hands.
*Sluk / Byron Spencer, who has a face composed of tentacles.
*Zeitgeist / Axel Cluney, the team leader, who can vomit acidic ooze from his mouth. He conspires with Coach to have his teammates killed, but is caught in the crossfire and killed as well. He previously had a one-night stand with U-Go Girl.

===X-Cellent===
* Rosa Lemper, East German mutant made of concrete.
* Jenny Spiegel / The Mirror Girl, a blue skinned mutant.
* Whoosh / Billy McMullen, teleporter but killed by Zeitgeist.
* Fluff, capable of creating clouds of chest hair. Killed by Zeitgeist. 
* Hurt John, able to read people&#x27;s worst fears.
* Uno, giant eyeball capable of blasts.

==Reception==
Despite receiving condemnation from the British royal family, &quot;X-Statix&quot; received critical acclaim, if not high popularity among readers. In naming &quot;X-Statix&quot; as one of &quot;5 Marvel Properties That, Even After ‘Guardians of the Galaxy,’ Are Still Too Weird for the Big Screen&quot;, &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote that &quot;X-Statix&quot; &quot;viciously deconstructed every phony bit of comic-book artifice&quot;, put &quot;fame-whoring media culture on trial&quot;, and confronted issues of race, class, and sexuality. IGN wrote that the frequency with which characters were killed off &quot;lent the book an air of danger and unpredictability rare to mainstream superhero titles.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included &quot;X-Statix&quot; in a list of &quot;15 Comic Books We Want to See as Movies&quot;, saying that the work &quot;has never looked more timely.&quot; Previously, in 2003, the magazine had given the series an A rating, calling it a &quot;razor-sharp media critique with hyperbolic dialogue.&quot; &quot;Fumettologica&quot; praised the subtlety of the metatextuality in its satire, mentioning the character Anarchist&#x27;s fear that people won&#x27;t support adding a second African American to the team.

<text>The Chrysler Sigma is a version of the Mitsubishi Galant automobile that was built by Chrysler Australia in Adelaide, South Australia from 1977. When Mitsubishi Motors Australia (MMAL) took over Chrysler Australia&#x27;s manufacturing facilities in 1980, they renamed the vehicle the Mitsubishi Sigma. The range was progressively discontinued and replaced by the Mitsubishi Magna, starting with the sedan in 1985 and the wagon in 1987.

== First generation ==
=== GE (1977–1980) ===
Chrysler launched the GE series Sigma in October 1977 to replace the outgoing GD Galant. Assembly occurred at the Tonsley Park, Adelaide plant.

The GE series Sigma was the first to introduce the Australian market to the &quot;Astron&quot; engine range. The 1.6-litre &quot;Saturn&quot; engine with four-speed manual transmission was also available in the base model, badged Sigma Galant. The &quot;Saturn&quot; engine was good for of power and of torque. The mid-range model, the Sigma GL, came standard with the 1.85-litre &quot;Astron&quot; and four-speed manual, providing and . Both Galant and GL had an upgrade option to the 2.0-litre &quot;Astron&quot; engine—standard with four-speed manual or optional five-speed manual or three-speed automatic. 
Outputs for the 2.0-litre were and . The top-line model, the Sigma SE, offered the 2.0-litre and five-speed standard—automatic remained an option. The &quot;Astron&quot; engines were initially imported, with the Lonsdale, South Australia engine plant producing the &quot;Astron&quot; from October 1979.

Sigma SE offered equipment including five-position, reclining rear seats. An interior boot lid release, roof console (incorporating dome lamp, map reading lamp, seat belt and door ajar warning lamps), steel belt radial ply tyres, laminated windscreen, distinctive grille, smoked glass on all instrument dials, front seat back pockets, and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; cloth trim were also standard with the SE (with leather optional). The SE was further distinguished by its body-coloured hubcaps with silver trim.

From launch, Chrysler also offered a &quot;Sportspack&quot; option for the GL 2.0-litre. This included exterior striping, quartz-halogen high-beam headlights, a sports steering wheel, low-fuel warning light, tachometer and steel belted radial tyres.

In March 1978, a Japanese-made, two-door coupé version called the &quot;Sigma Scorpion&quot; was released—based on the Mitsubishi Galant Lambda. Although the Sigma Scorpion shared many common engine and mechanical components with the sedan, all body panels and most interior features were unique to the coupe. On 12 October 1978, a station wagon body variant of the Sigma was released—available in Galant, GL, and SE trims.

On 1 November 1979, Chrysler announced and commenced sales of the enlarged, 2.6-litre &quot;Astron&quot; engined Sigma GL and SE. At the same time, the 1.85-litre engine was dropped. Paired only with the automatic gearbox, 2.6-litre was believed to be the biggest four-cylinder engine sold internationally at the time. The 2.6 came further equipped a new braking system with larger front discs and a 56 percent increase in pad area. 14-inch cast alloy wheels were also made available as a further option for the 2.6. The 2.6 was noted for its smoothness and refinement, although less so than its 2.0-litre counterpart. Its large displacement made it competitive with six-cylinder rivals. Chrysler claimed of power and torque of . According to Chrysler, this made it the most powerful four-cylinder engine sold in Australia at the time.

=== GH (1980–1982) ===
On 28 April 1980, Chrysler unveiled the GH Sigma in Brisbane. Then on 30 April, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors jointly acquired Chrysler&#x27;s remaining 65 percent share of Chrysler Australia (bringing the dual Mitsubishi ownership to 98.9 percent). On 1 October 1980, the GH range was rebadged from Chrysler Sigma to Mitsubishi Sigma, due to the renaming of Chrysler Australia to Mitsubishi Motors Australia (MMAL) following the buy-out.

Released to the market on 12 May, the GH series saw a considerable facelift on both front and rear ends. While it was only introduced to Australia in 1980, the facelift actually appeared on the Japanese home market Galant models and on New Zealand assembled Mitsubishi Sigma models in 1979.

The mechanical layout was as before except for addition of a five-speed manual for the 2.6-litre model (with automatic exiled to the options list). The base model was now simply called &quot;Sigma&quot; instead of &quot;Sigma Galant&quot;.

A GLX model was placed between GL and SE level and was advertised as a &quot;sports pack&quot;. A limited run of 1,016 &quot;Peter Wherrett&quot; editions of the GLX were built (option A05), named after Australian motoring journalist Peter Wherrett who was given the task of improving the handling of the Sigma by MMAL after complaining about it. The improvements included 15-inch Globe &quot;Montego&quot; alloy wheels fitted with Pirelli P6 tyres, Recaro seats, Momo steering wheel, Sonic extractors, as well as lowered coil springs and Bilstein shock absorbers.

Mitsubishi released a limited edition, GL-based Sigma Satellite in c. April 1981, adding two-tone paint (available in three combinations), unique hubcaps, a soft grip sports steering wheel, cloth upholstery, full tinted glass including laminated windscreen. In September 1981, in partnership with turbocharger specialists Normalair-Garrett, Mitsubishi produced a limited run of 500 Sigma Turbos, the first Australian-built turbocharged production car. The forced-induction 2.0-litre &quot;Astron&quot; powerplant produced and . Mitsubishi discontinued the GH series in February 1982.

== Second generation ==
=== GJ (1982–1984) ===

The redesigned GJ Sigma was released in March 1982, based on the 1980 Japanese domestic market Mitsubishi Galant. While a complete redevelopment was done for the sedan models, the wagon models in fact were new only from the firewall forward—the rest of the bodyshell was still GH based. Engine and transmission offerings remained as before, but received power and torque boosts; the 2.0-litre now produced and and the 2.6-litre and .

In February 1983, Mitsubishi launched a special edition Sigma GL Satellite. Priced $1,000 below the GL luxury level, the Satellite was built in sedan and wagon versions, with air conditioning, five-speed manual or automatic transmission all as options. However, two-tone paintwork, a laminated windscreen, AM/FM radio, adjustable steering column, intermittent windscreen wipers and a heated rear window were fitted as standard equipment.

The SE model featured cut pile carpets, a tachometer, overhead reading lamps, door step lamps, rear footwell lamps, four-speaker AM/FM/MPX stereo radio/cassette system, remote boot and fuel cap releases, adjustable lumbar support and tilt for the driver seat, and tinted side windows.

A sporting model, the Sigma GSR, was also released with either 2.0 or 2.6-litre engines offered with either automatic or manual transmissions. Features included alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a sports steering wheel and blackouts, particularly on the window frames and doorhandles.

June 1983 saw the entry-level Sigma rebadged as the Sigma XL, to coincide with the trim level designations on MMAL&#x27;s small car, the Colt.

October 1983 saw the release of the luxurious, Sigma Super Saloon. Produced as a limited edition of 500 cars and placed above the SE trim level from which it derives, it came only with the 2.6-litre in either five-speed manual or three-speed automatic. The five-speed manual fitted was of Japanese origin, rather than the BorgWarner Australia unit previously fitted to Sigmas, and the suspension received a re-tune. The Super Saloon featured two-tone metallic paint and crushed velour upholstery for the interior. Two paint and trim combinations were offered—blue upper body with silver lower body and blue interior—or dark brown/light brown exterior with a bronze interior. The Super Saloon introduced standard power steering, power windows and central locking—features that also became optional on Sigma GL, SE, and GSR trims. The central floor console was also revised to accommodate the power window and central door locking switches. Other equipment fitted to the Super Saloon included air conditioning, alloy wheels, and four-wheel disc brakes.

The GJ series Sigma had the distinction of being the only Australian car during the 1980s to be exported to Europe (Chrysler previously did this with the Australian Valiant). The car was sold in the United Kingdom, in both sedan and wagon models, under the marque Lonsdale.
=== GK (1984–1985) ===

The GK Series was released in March 1984. It was a comprehensive facelift, both outside and in. Externally the GK was changed by having a new bonnet and a shallower grille, while at the rear new taillight clusters (which had actually appeared in certain overseas markets in 1982) and rear valance were fitted, the registration plate being relocated below the bumper. Internally the specifications and trim of the models had changed. Seats were different in certain models, particularly the GL, and all models had the option of power windows (although rare), an option not available in most previous models.

The Sigma XL was the entry-level model of the range and came with either the 1.6 or 2.0-litre engines. In the SE, velour seats with lumbar control, adjustable headrests and a fold-down rear seat armrest with boot access were fitted. Reading lights incorporated into the roof-mounted dome light and built into the rear pillars were now a stock feature on the SE model Sigma. Power assisted steering was also an option along with electric windows. The SE model Sigma had stock dual line striping around the car, with chrome bonnet indicators.

Chrome detailing (around gauges and air vents, which often had a tendency to peel off) was replaced by black painting, and the door trim was now two-tone in certain models. A few other slight changes were included in the GK Sigma, for example, the boot was fully lined with carpet and also featured a plastic protector for the lights. A painted boot with only base carpet was used in the GN Sigma, with no plastic light protector. Also, red courtesy lights were built into the bottom of the doors on the SE model.

As for the mechanics of the car, the GK was unchanged from the GJ, while the SE model featured rear disc brakes as standard. The GSR received a sportier front air dam, rear spoiler and 15-inch alloy wheels and was only available with the 2.6-litre engine and five-speed manual transmission. The GSR Sigma also had a sports steering wheel, black door frames and door handles and came standard with rear disc brakes.

In July 1984, Mitsubishi reintroduced the Super Saloon trim level, again based on the Sigma SE sedan and incorporating luxury items normally offered as options. The GK Super Saloon generally followed the GJ&#x27;s structure, although changes included new corduroy trim and stereo system with Compact Cassette facility, AM/FM scan tuning, and digital display. Mitsubishi also introduced a limited edition GK Sigma Satellite in late 1984, based on the XL but with the 2.6-litre engine and five-speed manual (or automatic optional), side stripes with Satellite badge identification, cloth-trimmed upholstery, AM/FM/MPX radio with dual speakers, distinguished wheel trim, additional silencing, tinted windscreen, and heated rear window.
=== GN (1985–1987) ===
Released in July 1985, the GN was an update, but also a rationalization of the previous Sigma range due to only being offered in GL trim. The range was rationalized due to the April 1985 release of the Mitsubishi Magna front-wheel drive range, which was developed eventually to replace the Sigma in Australia.

The GN range had a number of external trim changes over its predecessors, notably a black trim line around the base of the body, and the deletion of the wrap-round chrome strip seen on the previous model. The grille was remodelled, resembling the SE grille of the previous model, and new hubcaps were used with alloy wheels from the previous SE models optional. The largest change however, concerned the wagon models. To freshen the model before the impending release of the Magna wagon (which was being developed at that time, for a 1987 release), a new higher roof (dubbed &quot;high roof&quot;) was developed for the car, which helped to improve the car&#x27;s overall cabin space. It gave the wagon a unique appearance from its predecessors, particularly as it incorporated a roof-mounted spoiler.

Engine-wise, the GN Sigma was offered either with the &quot;Astron&quot; 2.0-litre ( at 5600 rpm and at 2400 rpm) or the &quot;Astron II&quot; 2.6-litre ( at 5200 rpm and at 2400 rpm) units. The &quot;Astron II&quot; had a few changes over the previous models, notably a newly designed head with hydraulic tappets (replacing the manual tappets in previous &quot;Astron&quot;s) and flat-top pistons. The oil pressure switch was now located at the rear of the cylinder block. In December 1985, the 2.0-litre versions were dropped, as Mitsubishi did not believe it warranted the conversion to unleaded fuel. Unleaded was introduced in Australia in January 1986.

Mitsubishi launched GL Satellite limited editions of the GN series in c. October 1986, adding air conditioning, unique striping, headlamp protectors, front and rear mudflaps, tilt adjustable steering column, remote control tailgate (for wagons) and side mirrors.

The &quot;high roof&quot; Sigma wagon was an export model for MMAL. During 1986–1987 station wagons were shipped to New Zealand, due to that market&#x27;s demand for wagon models. Although they were of a previous generation to the front-wheel drive Mitsubishi Sigma sedan (which was similar, but of a narrower bodyshell to the Magna, and fitted with smaller engines) range being sold in New Zealand, they proved popular, particularly with fleets.

This final generation of the Sigma ceased production in early 1987, due to the release of the Magna wagon models, completing the overall Magna range.

<text>The Indian national calendar, also called the Shaka calendar or Śaka calendar, is a solar calendar that is used alongside the Gregorian calendar by &quot;The Gazette of India&quot;, in news broadcasts by All India Radio, and in calendars and official communications issued by the Government of India. It was adopted in 1957 following the recommendation of the Calendar Reform Committee.

&quot;Śaka Samvat&quot; is generally 78 years behind the Gregorian calendar, except from January–March, when it is behind by 79 years.

== Calendar structure ==
The calendar months follow the signs of the tropical zodiac rather than the sidereal zodiac normally used with the Hindu and Buddhist calendars.
Chaitra is the first month of the calendar and begins on or near the March equinox. Chaitra has 30 days and starts on 22 March, except in leap years, when it has 31 days and starts on 21 March. All months other than Chaitra start on fixed dates in the Gregorian calendar. The months in the first half of the year all average out to having 31 days, to take into account the slower movement of the sun across the ecliptic at this time. This is similar to the Iranian Solar Hijri calendar.

The names of the months are derived from the older Hindu lunisolar calendar, so variations in spellings exist, and there is a possible source of confusion as to what calendar a date belongs to.

The names of the weekdays are derived from the seven classical planets (see Navagraha). The first day of the week is Ravivāra (Sunday). The official calendar reckoned by the government of India has Sunday as the first and Saturday as the last day of the week.

Years are counted in the Shaka era, which starts its year 0 in the year of the Common Era. To determine leap years, add 78 to the &quot;Shaka&quot; year – if the result is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar, then the Shaka year is a leap year as well.

==History==

Senior Indian Astrophysicist Meghnad Saha was the head of the Calendar Reform Committee under the aegis of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
It was Saha&#x27;s effort which led to the formation of the committee in 1952. The task before the committee was to prepare an accurate calendar based on scientific study, which could be adopted uniformly throughout India. The committee had to undertake a detailed study of thirty different calendars prevalent in different parts of the country. The task was further complicated by the integration of those calendars with religion and local sentiments.

In 1954 the committee recommended a fixed tropical solar calendar for use as a unified national civil calendar, which was adopted as the Indian national calendar. A tropical lunisolar calendar was also proposed for religious purposes but this recommendation was not accepted.

India&#x27;s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, in his preface to the Report of the committee, published in 1955, wrote:
: &quot;They (different calendars) represent past political divisions in the country ... . Now that we have attained Independence, it is obviously desirable that there should be a certain uniformity in the calendar for our civic, social, and other purposes, and this should be done on a scientific approach to this problem.&quot;

Usage started officially on 1 Chaitra 1879 Saka Era, or 22 March 1957. However, despite the government&#x27;s attempts to propagate the calendar through official Rashtriya Panchangs, the Indian national calendar did not find acceptance with panchang makers or the general public, and current usage is largely limited to governmental offices. Existing calendars based on the Saka era remain in use, which can lead to confusion.

<text>Kipling is the western terminus station of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway system. The station is served by buses and subway trains operated by the Toronto Transit Commission and is adjacent to the Kipling GO Station on the Milton line of GO Transit and the Kipling Bus Terminal, where passengers can connect with MiWay and GO Transit bus services. It opened on November 21, 1980, as part of the extensions west, to this station, and east to Kennedy station. It is located in the Islington–City Centre West neighbourhood on St. Albans Road at Aukland Road, west of the overpass of Kipling Avenue, after which the station is named. The 900 Airport Express bus route connects Kipling to the Toronto Pearson International Airport.

== History ==

An official opening ceremony for Kipling and Kennedy stations, in what was then the Borough of Etobicoke, was held on November 21, 1980. This pair of one-stop extensions at opposite ends of the Bloor–Danforth line were opened to the public the following day. Kipling and Kennedy were designed similarly, with both stations having an island platform that is typical of terminal stations. The outer platform walls at Kipling were originally two rows of vertical yellow vinyl slats separated by a black strip showing the station&#x27;s name in Univers font. This wall treatment was replaced by off-white fitted enamelled panels using the traditional Toronto Subway font with black trim with smaller lettering along the top in a 2017 renovation, evoking the older stations along the line.

In 1999, this station became accessible with the addition of elevators, one of the first accessible stations in the city.

As a result of the initial lack of density near the station, and its location near a hydro substation, it was originally designed around commuter travel, with a large amount of parking spaces (over 1,300) and a roughed-in platform for a future light rail or light metro line, like the Scarborough RT at Kennedy.

In the early 2020s, a new regional bus terminal was built on the site of the Kipling North commuter parking lot. Serving both MiWay and GO Transit, the bus terminal opened in 2021. An underground tunnel links the subway station to the regional bus terminal, and an accessible link bridge connects to the Kipling GO Station. , 1,067 commuter parking spaces remain, located south of the station in the hydro corridor.

== Facilities ==
The main entrance is located at the west end of the station, with access to the GO station, commuter parking lots, and a kiss and ride area for passenger drop-off. An entrance at the east end makes the bus platform level accessible by way of a ramp, with an elevator providing a connection with the train platform below. Fares can be paid for at this station by using tokens, tickets, passes, as well as the Presto card. Currently it serves the high density residential and commercial developments that are being built, while acting as a hub for commuter travel.

Above the subway tracks on the south side of the station, opposite the bus bays on the same level, is an unfinished platform for a proposed but never-built Etobicoke RT line similar to Line 3 Scarborough.

East of the station towards , the line continues on the surface alongside the railway right-of-way which parallels Dundas Street at a distance. It crosses over Bloor Street to the north side alongside the railway tracks, then dives underground below the tracks and turns parallel to Bloor.

===Kipling Yard===

Currently the tail end tracks west of the station can be used to store 2 cars sets.

There were plans to establish a yard to replace Greenwood Yard (and allow Greenwood to be dedicated to the since-abandoned Relief Line) and potential exists for Metrolinx and the TTC to purchase land on the former CPR Obico Yard bounded by Shorncliffe Road and North Queen Street for a shared storage facility for subway cars and GO trains. Most of the former CPR intermodal yard, an open area not occupied by structures, is now owned by the City of Toronto and been partially used to store TTC buses since 2019 as North Queen Yard and other yards were leased out.

== Surface connections ==

The TTC bus platform is in the fare-paid zone, allowing passengers to quickly transfer between the subway and the following TTC bus routes:
* Some 300 Bloor–Danforth trips do not enter the bus terminal, but can be accessed at Aukland Road at Dundas Street.
* A courtesy bus used to be operated by IKEA between Kipling station and the IKEA Etobicoke store. However, service was discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Islington is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the north side of Bloor Street West on the west side of Islington Avenue. A central platform serves trains running in both directions.

==History==

Islington station was opened in 1968 in what was then the Borough of Etobicoke and served as the western terminus for Line 2 Bloor–Danforth for 12 years until the extension to was completed in 1980.

Until 1973, TTC buses and subway trains serving the station were in separate fare zones and so turnstiles and collector booths were placed between the bus bays and the subway platforms. The fare barrier was reconfigured after the zones were abolished to put the bus bays inside the fare-paid zone, and its layout was simplified in a later renovation.

However, the bus bays have also been used by non-TTC buses. In the early years, some Gray Coach long-distance services called at Islington, and the Airport Express, also then operated by Gray Coach, had an Islington station route. Greyhound eventually took over this Gray Coach route in 1992 and transferred to Pacific Western Europe in 1993. MiWay buses from Mississauga, which at first stopped outside the station, began using several of the bus bays in 1980 after they were no longer needed for TTC buses once Kipling station opened. On January 4, 2021, MiWay moved its operations from this station to a new regional bus terminal at Kipling station.

A redevelopment of the bus terminal is planned during the 2020s, as part of upgrade works to make the station accessible.

==Station description==

The station is located on the northwest side of Bloor Street West and Islington Avenue, and is built on three levels. Street level is where all three parking lots, all three entrances, as well as where the bus platform is located. The entrances to the station can be found at the main parking, and at the east and west sides of Islington Avenue respectively.

Below street level is the concourse and collector, which provides stair access to the bus platforms above it. The subway platforms are underneath the concourse and collector level. There are no elevators in this station, which makes it inaccessible for persons with physical disabilities.

===Parking===
Three parking lots serve Islington station, providing a total of 977 spaces: The main lot beside the station northwest of Bloor Street at Islington has 534 spaces; the lot at the north end of Lomond Drive has 283 spaces; and the newest lot beside the railway tracks on the south side of Bloor Street off Fieldway Road has 160 spaces. All three of these parking lots are scheduled to be redeveloped in the 2020s, for station upgrade work as well as new residential development.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

There is a both a crossover (used mainly back when the station was a terminus, but still used occasionally to short turn trains) and a centre storage track east of the station, with the crossover being situated directly adjacent to it. The centre track is immediately east of the crossover and is partially underground and on the surface, creating a triple portal unique to the subway system: the Montgomery Portal. The line then crosses Mimico Creek on a bridge and then returns underground at the Aberfoyle Portal, en route to Royal York station.

==Nearby landmarks==
*Bloor Islington Place, at 3250-3300 Bloor St. West, has direct access to the station This office complex is a Class &quot;A&quot; asset, totalling in a location situated at the intersection of Bloor and Islington. Three office towers are linked with a retail concourse of multiple retailers, include Sobeys Urban Fresh, a GoodLife Fitness and food court. This west end office complex also features direct access to the subway. On the east side of Islington Avenue and the neighbourhood of Islington Village is short distance north of the station at Dundas Street West.

The station is served by several TTC bus routes and one MiWay route. All but one of the MiWay system&#x27;s Toronto-bound bus routes which used to connect at this station were moved to serve a new regional bus terminal which opened on January 4, 2021, at Kipling station.

===Toronto Transit Commission=== 
Buses are accessed via the bus terminal. During overnight hours when the subway is not running, an on-street transfer between buses is required. TTC routes serving the station include:


===MiWay===

MiWay&#x27;s 26 Burnhamthorpe to South Common Centre route continues to serve this station and is boarded on-street.

==Station redevelopment==
The deadline to make all Toronto subway stations accessible is 2025, as per the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. platforms at Islington station are not accessible.

In the late 2000s, the TTC planned to renovate and upgrade the stationreplacing the existing bus terminal, providing elevators to the subway platform, and completing overall station modernization. An open house was held on April 22, 2008, and the project&#x27;s stated completion time was given as between 2011 and 2012. The project had not been completed by 2014, and its completion date was being pushed further into the future at that time.

In 2021, MiWay buses, with the exception of route 26 Burnhamthorpe, moved to the new Kipling bus terminal, freeing up the Islington site for redevelopment. Route 26 Burnhamthorpe does not enter the bus terminal and instead utilizes the on-street stop. Plans were subsequently submitted by the TTC to the city government for redevelopment of the station. These would involve replacing the existing bus terminal with a new TTC bus terminal, providing elevators throughout the station and building a new station entrance on Islington Avenue.

The existing commuter parking lots to the south of the station are also proposed to be redeveloped by the city for residential development.

In the second quarter of 2023, the TTC began constructing elevators for the centre platform; the elevators will connect to the street-level concourse. Construction is expected to be completed in 2024. Part of this project would include the station being fully redeveloped and a new TTC bus terminal being built. Work on those improvements is expected to be completed by 2026.

<text>Acrosin is a digestive enzyme that acts as a protease. In humans, acrosin is encoded by the &quot;ACR&quot; gene. Acrosin is released from the acrosome of spermatozoa as a consequence of the acrosome reaction. It aids in the penetration of the Zona Pellucida.

== Enzyme Mechanism ==
Acrosin is a typical serine proteinase with trypsin-like specificity.

The reaction proceeds according to the usual serine protease mechanism. First, His-57 deprotonates Ser-195, allowing it to serve as a nucleophile. Deprotonated Ser-195 then reacts with the carbonyl carbon of a peptide, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. The tetrahedral intermediate then collapses, resulting in an H2N-R1 leaving group, which is protonated through His-57. Finally, His-57 deprotonates a water molecule, which can then serve as a nucleophile by similarly reacting with the carbonyl carbon. Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate then results in a Ser-195 leaving group, which is protonated through His-57, resulting in all residues returned to their pre-catalytic state, and a carboxylic acid where there was previously a peptide bond.

== Biological Function ==

Acrosin is the major proteinase present in the acrosome of mature spermatozoa. It is stored in the acrosome in its precursor form, proacrosin. Upon stimulus, the acrosome releases its contents onto the zona pellucida. After this reaction occurs, the zymogen form of the protease is then processed into its active form, β-acrosin. The active enzyme then functions in the lysis of the zona pellucida, thus facilitating penetration of the sperm through the innermost glycoprotein layers of the ovum.

The importance of acrosin in the acrosome reaction has been contested. It has been found through genetic knockout experiments that mouse spermatozoa lacking β-acrosin (the active protease) still have the ability to penetrate the zona pellucida. Thus, some argue for its role in assisting in the dispersal of acrosomal contents following the acrosome reaction, while others demonstrate evidence for its role as a secondary binding protein between the spermatozoa and zona pellucida. Under the secondary binding protein hypothesis, acrosin could serve a role in binding to molecules on the zona pellucida, tethering the spermatozoa to the egg. This &quot;tethering&quot; would ensure penetration due to the applied motile force of the spermatozoa.

Acrosin regulation has been found to occur through protein C inhibitor (PCI). PCI is present in the male reproductive tract at 40x higher concentrations than in blood plasma. PCI has been demonstrated to inhibit the proteolytic activity of acrosin. Thus, PCI has been hypothesized to have a protective role: if acrosomal enzymes were released prematurely, or if the spermatozoa was degenerated within the male reproductive tract, the high concentrations of PCI would inhibit acrosin from inflicting proteolytic damage on nearby tissues.

== Structure ==
β-acrosin demonstrates a high degree of sequence identity (70-80%) between boar, bull, rat, guinea pig, mouse, and human isoforms. There exists a somewhat similar (27-35%) sequence identity between β-acrosin and other serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. While most serine proteases are activated through one cleavage event, proacrosin requires processing at both the N and C-terminal domains. Proacrosin is first cleaved between Arg-22 and adjacent Valine to create a 22 residue light chain, and an active protease termed α-acrosin. This light chain remains associated with the heavy chain, cross-linked through two disulfide bonds to form a heterodimer. Following these N-terminal cleavage events, three cleavages at the C-terminal domain removes 70 residues, yielding β-acrosin. Acrosin has two sites which have been identified as possible N-glycosylation sites: Asn-2 and Asn-169.

The catalytic triad consists of residues His-57, Asp-102, and Ser-195. These residues are found in a binding pocket that has been termed the &quot;S1&quot; pocket, consistent with the naming scheme that has been adopted for other proteases. The S1 pocket regulates acrosin&#x27;s specificity for Arg and Lys substrates, with a conserved Trp-215 serving as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; residue for the binding site entrance.

An important structural element of β-acrosin is a highly charged patch (formed through both amino acids and post-translational modifications) on its surface region, that has been termed the &quot;anion binding exosite.&quot; This site consists of an area of excess positive charge, which has been hypothesized to be important in binding to the matrix of the zona pellucida, a heavily glycosylated and sulfated region with excess negative charge. This structural feature is consistent with the secondary binding protein hypothesis, as charge-charge interactions would stabilize a protein-zona pellucida &quot;tethering&quot; complex. Further consistent with this structural hypothesis is the knowledge that suramin - a polysulfated drug (with substantial corresponding negative charge) has been found to inhibit sperm-zona pellucida binding.

== Disease and Pharmaceutical Relevance ==
While one study which utilized mice models indicated that acrosin is not a necessary component of zona pellucida penetration, other studies in humans have shown an association between low acrosomal proteinase activity and infertility. Other research groups have demonstrated a significant correlation between acrosin activity and sperm motility. In rabbit models, an intravaginal contraceptive device that secreted tetradecyl sodium sulfate, a known inhibitor of acrosin and hyaluronidases, had a complete contraceptive effect. Although its exact mechanism of action is not entirely clear, acrosin could thus serve as a novel target for contraceptive agents. Acrosin may represent as a uniquely druggable target due to its location and high cellular specificity. Thus, developing inhibitors of acrosin could provide the basis for safe, reversible male contraceptives, or female contraceptives through the use of intravaginal contraceptive devices.

Moreover, as serine proteases are important in the potentiation of HIV, research has found that an acrosin inhibitor, 4&#x27;-acetamidophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate, possess the ability to inhibit HIV infection in virus-inoculated lymphocytes. This suggests the further role of acrosin inhibitors as potentially viable agents in the prevention of HIV transmission.

<doc id="1305752" wikidata="Q465195" url="?curid=1305752" title="Elvira de Hidalgo">
<text>Elvira Juana Rodríguez Roglán (December 28, 1891 – January 21, 1980), known professionally as Elvira de Hidalgo, was a prominent Spanish coloratura soprano, who later became a teacher and vocal coach. Her most famous pupil was Maria Callas.

==Biography==
She was born in Valderrobres, Aragon, in the northeast of Spain to Pedro Rodríguez Hidalgo and Miguela Roglán Bel.

She was a pupil of Concepció Bordalba in Barcelona and later studied in Milan under Melchiorre Vidal, who also taught Maria Barrientos, Graziella Pareto, Julián Gayarre, Fernando Valero, Francesc Viñas, and Rosina Storchio.

She made her debut at the age of sixteen, at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, as Rosina in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, which would become her best-known role. Following her debut, de Hidalgo was quickly engaged for Paris, where she sang Rosina opposite Feodor Chaliapin as Don Basilio. Appearances in Monte Carlo, Prague, and Cairo followed. Her debut with the New York Metropolitan Opera occurred in 1910, as Rosina. With that company, de Hidalgo sang in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (with Enrico Caruso) and &quot;La sonnambula&quot; (with Alessandro Bonci) in the same season. She would return to the Met in 1924-25, for &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (directed by Armando Agnini), &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (conducted by Tullio Serafin), and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (with Beniamino Gigli). Following that New York debut, she sang in Florence, in &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (as Zerlina, opposite Mattia Battistini). She also portrayed Rosina in Rome, in 1911. The soprano sang, as well, with Giuseppe Anselmi in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, in St Petersburg, in 1913.

In 1916, she made her debut at La Scala, Milan, as Rosina, and returned there in 1921. The following year, de Hidalgo appeared in Buenos Aires at the Teatro Colón, in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, and &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. In 1924, she appeared in London with the British National Opera Company, at Covent Garden, in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. On 17 February 1924, she also appeared at the Royal Albert Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra and Sir Thomas Beecham conducting. That same year, she sang &quot;Lakmé&quot; and &quot;Il barbiere&quot; in Chicago. In 1926-27, she appeared opposite Chaliapin again, for a tour of the United States and Canada, with his Universal Artists Incorporation Company, in &quot;Il barbiere&quot;.

==Recordings==
Elvira de Hidalgo recorded for Columbia, with arias from &quot;Il barbiere&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, and &quot;I puritani&quot; committed to disc in 1907-08. In 1909-10 she made discs for Fonotipia, with excerpts recorded from &quot;Il barbiere&quot;, &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, &quot;Dinorah&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and &quot;Mireille&quot;. She apparently returned to the Columbia studios, in 1925, to record a performance of the &quot;Mad Scene&quot; from &quot;Dinorah&quot;, then again to the studio in 1937-38. She is heard in Volume II of EMI&#x27;s &quot;The Record of Singing&quot;.

==Teaching career==
Elvira de Hidalgo began teaching in 1933, and later held a position at the Athens Conservatoire, where the young soprano Maria Callas became her student. In 1957, Callas wrote of the woman who had an &quot;essential role&quot; in her artistic formation:It is to this illustrious Spanish artist, whom the public and the old subscribers at La Scala will certainly recall as an unforgettable and superlative Rosina and as a splendid interpreter of other important roles, it is to this illustrious artist, I repeat, with a moved, devoted, and grateful heart, that I owe all my preparation and my artistic formation as an actress and musician. This elect woman, who, besides giving me her precious teaching, gave me her whole heart as well ...

==Death==
De Hidalgo died in Milan in 1980. She was initially buried in an unidentified grave until 1990 upon expiration, when her pupils and friends paid to relocate her remains to the Cimitero Maggiore di Milano, which expired in 2020. Her remains were exhumed on 26 February 2018 and transferred to Barcelona on 5 March. On 29 July, her remains returned and was re-buried in her hometown in Spain, with a lyrical gala, coinciding the inauguration of the exhibition dedicated to her memory at the Museo de Valderrobres, which featured a screening of &quot;Maria by Callas&quot;, and the placement of a plaque in her home building.

<text>Royal York is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located just north of Bloor Street West on the east side of Royal York Road.

==History==
The station was opened in 1968 in what was then the Borough of Etobicoke.

The original plan for the Bloor-Danforth extension to Islington had different stations than what was eventually built. The stations were to be at &quot;Montgomery&quot; and &quot;Prince Edward&quot;, instead of Islington and Royal York. This was probably because these two streets were the ends of the Kingsway shopping district. However, it was decided to include only one station in the Kingsway, at Royal York.

Until 1973 the buses and the subway trains serving the station were in separate fare zones and so the turnstiles and collector booths were on the mezzanine level between the bus bays and the subway platforms. When the zones were abolished, they were moved to just inside the street entrance, bringing the buses inside the station&#x27;s fare-paid area.

A local &quot;zone 2&quot; bus service continued to run along Bloor Street west of Jane, paralleling the &quot;zone 1&quot; subway, from the station&#x27;s opening through the zone abolishment in 1973, and continued to run even after the bus and subway were in the same zone. The success of the bus service may be attributed to the distances between subway stops in Etobicoke; Royal York is over 1 km west of Old Mill, and Islington is over west of Royal York. (By comparison, stops at Montgomery, Prince Edward and Old Mill would all be within 1 km of each other, as are all stops on the Bloor-Danforth from Old Mill through Main Street, an east-west corridor served almost entirely by the subway line.) The local bus service was discontinued in 1984, although the long station spacing remains; only at night are buses still seen along this stretch.

Construction began in mid-2017 to make the station fully accessible, including the addition of three elevators and accessible fare gates. On December 16, 2019, the station became accessible with the completion of the elevator construction.

<text>Old Mill is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 2672 Bloor Street West at Old Mill Terrace and Humber Boulevard in the Kingsway residential neighbourhood. Nearby destinations include the Old Mill Inn and Park Lawn Cemetery.

==History==
The station opened in 1968 in what was then the Borough of Etobicoke.

In 2000, the station was damaged by a fire on a waste collection train, just after the subway had closed for the night. This was most likely caused by a lit cigarette disposed of in a garbage can at another station. After this incident, the TTC switched to leaving waste outside stations for collection by truck.

==Station access upgrades==
As part of its Easier Access Program, two elevators will be added at the station from ground level to the two side platforms, along with the addition of other improvements such as tactile attention tiles, improved signage and CCTV cameras along the accessible pathway. Construction is expected to start in the second quarter of 2025. Old Mill will be the last Toronto subway station to be made accessible.

==Subway infrastructure==
The station is built on the west side of the Humber River valley. The west end of the station lies underground with the tunnel continuing toward Royal York. The east end of the platform is elevated on a viaduct that takes the line across the river to re-enter the tunnel on the other side of the valley toward Jane Station.

Glass walls at the train platform&#x27;s east end provide a view of the riverside park. Bird of prey shaped cutouts have been applied to these large windows to reduce the number of avian fatalities.

From when the station opened in 1968 until 1973, buses and the subway trains serving the station were in separate fare zones and the station&#x27;s bus loop was located outside the street entrance. Although the bus platforms have still not been integrated into the station&#x27;s fare-paid area, since only the one bus route is affected, this has a relatively minor impact on the flow of passengers through the turnstiles.

==Surface connections==

The station&#x27;s bus platform is not within the fare-paid area.

<text>The Afshar experiment is a variation of the double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics, devised and carried out by Shahriar Afshar in 2004. In the experiment, light generated by a laser passes through two closely spaced pinholes, and is refocused by a lens so that the image of each pinhole falls on a separate single-photon detector. In addition, a grid of thin wires is placed just before the lens on the dark fringes of an interference pattern.

Afshar claimed that the experiment gives information about which path a photon takes through the apparatus, while simultaneously allowing interference between the paths to be observed. According to Afshar, this violates the complementarity principle of quantum mechanics.

The experiment has been analyzed and repeated by a number of investigators. There are several theories that explain the effect without violating complementarity. John G. Cramer claims the experiment provides evidence for the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics over other interpretations.

== History ==
Shahriar Afshar&#x27;s experimental work was done initially at the Institute for Radiation-Induced Mass Studies (IRIMS) in Boston and later reproduced at Harvard University, while he was there as a visiting researcher. The results were first presented at a seminar at Harvard in March 2004. The experiment was featured as the cover story in the July 24, 2004 edition of the popular science magazine &quot;New Scientist&quot; endorsed by professor John G. Cramer of the University of Washington. The &quot;New Scientist&quot; feature article generated many responses, including various letters to the editor that appeared in the August 7 and August 14, 2004, issues, arguing against the conclusions being drawn by Afshar. The results were published in a SPIE conference proceedings in 2005. A follow-up paper was published in a scientific journal Foundations of Physics in January 2007 and featured in &quot;New Scientist&quot; in February 2007.

== Experimental setup ==


The experiment uses a setup similar to that for the double-slit experiment. In Afshar&#x27;s variant, light generated by a laser passes through two closely spaced &quot;circular&quot; pinholes (not slits). After the dual pinholes, a lens refocuses the light so that the image of each pinhole falls on separate photon-detectors (Fig. 1). With pinhole 2 closed, a photon that goes through pinhole 1 impinges only on photon detector 1. Similarly, with pinhole 1 closed, a photon that goes through pinhole 2 impinges only on photon detector 2. With both pinholes open, Afshar claims, citing Wheeler in support, that pinhole 1 remains correlated to photon Detector 1 (and vice versa for pinhole 2 to photon Detector 2), and therefore that which-way information is preserved when both pinholes are open.

When the light acts as a wave, because of quantum interference one can observe that there are regions that the photons avoid, called &quot;dark fringes&quot;. A grid of thin wires is placed just before the lens (Fig. 2) so that the wires lie in the dark fringes of an interference pattern which is produced by the dual pinhole setup. If one of the pinholes is blocked, the interference pattern will no longer be formed, and the grid of wires causes appreciable diffraction in the light and blocks some of it from detection by the corresponding photon detector. However, when both pinholes are open, the effect of the wires is negligible, comparable to the case in which there are no wires placed in front of the lens (Fig. 3), because the wires lie in the dark fringes of an interference pattern. The effect is not dependent on the light intensity (photon flux).

== Afshar&#x27;s interpretation ==
Afshar&#x27;s conclusion is that, when both pinholes are open, the light exhibits wave-like behavior when going past the wires, since the light goes through the spaces between the wires but avoids the wires themselves, but also exhibits particle-like behavior after going through the lens, with photons going to a correlated photo-detector. Afshar argues that this behavior contradicts the principle of complementarity to the extent that it shows both wave and particle characteristics in the same experiment for the same photons.

Afshar asserts that there is simultaneously high visibility &quot;V&quot; of interference as well as high distinguishability &quot;D&quot; (corresponding to which-path information), so that &quot;V&quot;2 + &quot;D&quot;2 &gt; 1, and the wave-particle duality relation is violated.

== Reception ==
=== Specific criticism===
A number of scientists have published criticisms of Afshar&#x27;s interpretation of his results, some of which reject the claims of a violation of complementarity, while differing in the way they explain how complementarity copes with the experiment. For example, one paper contests Afshar&#x27;s core claim, that the Englert–Greenberger duality relation is violated. The researchers re-ran the experiment, using a different method for measuring the visibility of the interference pattern than that used by Afshar, and found no violation of complementarity, concluding &quot;This result demonstrates that the experiment can be perfectly explained by the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.&quot;

Below is a synopsis of papers by several critics highlighting their main arguments and the disagreements they have amongst themselves:

* Ruth Kastner, Committee on the History and Philosophy of Science, University of Maryland, College Park.
*:Kastner&#x27;s criticism, published in a peer-reviewed paper, proceeds by setting up a thought experiment and applying Afshar&#x27;s logic to it to expose its flaw. She proposes that Afshar&#x27;s experiment is equivalent to preparing an electron in a spin-up state and then measuring its sideways spin. This does not imply that one has found out the up-down spin state and the sideways spin state of any electron simultaneously. Applied to Afshar&#x27;s experiment: &quot;Nevertheless, even with the grid removed, since the photon is prepared in a superposition &quot;S&quot;, the measurement at the final screen at &quot;t&quot;2 &quot;never really is&quot; a &#x27;which-way&#x27; measurement (the term traditionally attached to the slit-basis observable formula_1), because it cannot tell us &#x27;which slit the photon actually went through.&#x27;
* Daniel Reitzner, Research Center for Quantum Information, Institute of Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia. 
*:Reitzner performed numerical simulations, published in a preprint, of Afshar&#x27;s arrangement and obtained the same results that Afshar obtained experimentally. From this he argues that the photons exhibit wave behavior, including high fringe visibility but no which-way information, up to the point they hit the detector: &quot;In other words the two-peaked distribution is an interference pattern and the photon behaves as a wave and exhibits no particle properties until it hits the plate. As a result a which-way information can never be obtained in this way.&quot;
* W. G. Unruh, Professor of Physics at University of British Columbia
*:Unruh, like Kastner, proceeds by setting up an arrangement that he feels is equivalent but simpler. The size of the effect is larger so that it is easier to see the flaw in the logic. In Unruh&#x27;s view that flaw is, in the case that an obstacle exists at the position of the dark fringes, &quot;drawing the inference that IF the particle was detected in detector 1, THEN it must have come from path 1. Similarly, IF it were detected in detector 2, then it came from path 2.&quot; In other words, he accepts the existence of an interference pattern but rejects the existence of which-way information.
* Luboš Motl, Former assistant professor of physics, Harvard University.
*:Motl&#x27;s criticism, published in his blog, is based on an analysis of Afshar&#x27;s actual setup, instead of proposing a different experiment like Unruh and Kastner. In contrast to Unruh and Kastner, he believes that which-way information always exists, but argues that the measured contrast of the interference pattern is actually very low: &quot;Because this signal (disruption) from the second, middle picture is small (equivalently, it only affects a very small portion of the photons), the contrast V is also very small, and goes to zero for infinitely thin wires.&quot; He also argues that the experiment can be understood with classical electrodynamics and has &quot;nothing to do with quantum mechanics&quot;.
* Ole Steuernagel, School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire, UK.
*:Steuernagel makes a quantitative analysis of the various transmitted, refracted, and reflected modes in a setup that differs only slightly from Afshar&#x27;s. He concludes that the Englert-Greenberger duality relation is strictly satisfied, and in particular that the fringe visibility for thin wires is small. Like some of the other critics, he emphasizes that inferring an interference pattern is not the same as measuring one: &quot;Finally, the greatest weakness in the analysis given by Afshar is the &quot;inference&quot; that an interference pattern must be present.&quot;
* Andrew Knight, Department of Physics, New York University 
*:Argues that Afshar&#x27;s claim to violate complementarity is a simple logical inconsistency: by setting up the experiment so that photons are spatially coherent over the two pinholes, the pinholes are necessarily indistinguishable by those photons. “In other words, Afshar et al. claim in one breath to have set up the experiment so that pinholes A and B are inherently indistinguishable by certain photons [specifically, photons that are produced to be spatially coherent over the width spanned by pinholes that are thus incapable of distinguishing them], and in another breath to have distinguished pinholes A and B with those same photons.”

=== Specific support ===
* Afshar&#x27;s coauthors Eduardo Flores and Ernst Knoesel criticize Kastner&#x27;s setup and propose an alternative experimental setup. By removing the lens of Afshar and causing two beams to overlap at a small angle, Flores et al. aimed to show that conservation of momentum guarantee the preservation of which-path information when both pinholes are open. But this experiment is still subject to Motl&#x27;s objection that the 2 beams have a sub-microscopic diffraction pattern created by the convergence of the beams before the slits; the result would have been the measuring of which slit was open before the wires were ever reached.

*John G. Cramer adopts Afshar&#x27;s interpretation of the experiment to support his own transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics over the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation.

<text>The Vesdre (), Weser () or Vesder () is a river in Liège Province, eastern Belgium.

==River==
A few kilometres of the upper reaches also flow through the German municipality Roetgen and form part of the Belgian–German border. The Vesdre&#x27;s total length is approximately . It is a right tributary to the river Ourthe. Its source lies in the High Fens (, , ), close to the border with Germany near Monschau. It flows through an artificial lake (Lake Eupen), and then through the towns of Eupen, Verviers, Pepinster and Chaudfontaine. The Vesdre flows into the Ourthe a few kilometres from Liège where the Ourthe in turn flows into the river Meuse.

The water of the Vesdre has a high acidity (due to the Hautes Fagnes bogs), which made it very suitable for the textiles industry around Verviers. The Vesdre was the far eastern end of the sillon industriel, the backbone of Walloon industry. Nowadays, the water of the Vesdre is mainly used as drinking water.

<text>Jane is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located just north of Bloor Street West, spanning the block east of Jane Street to Armadale Avenue, with entrances from all three streets. It opened in 1968 as part of the westerly extension from Keele to Islington Station.

In 2006, this station became accessible with the addition of elevators between the street and platform level.

==Entrances==

The station&#x27;s street entrances lead directly into the bus platform area in a layout that would not allow it to be readily brought into the station&#x27;s fare-paid area. Until 1973 this was largely irrelevant because the station was on a fare zone boundary and the subway trains and some of the buses serving it were in separate zones.

At the west end, the Jane Street entrance is located just north of Bloor, on the east side of Jane Street. Similarly, at the other end of bus platform, there is an entrance directly from the west side of Armadale Avenue. Additionally, the station is accessible through automatic doors via a pedestrian walkway located mid-block on the north side of Bloor Street, between Jane and Armadale.

==Nearby landmarks==
The station serves the local communities of Bloor West Village, Swansea, Runnymede, Old Mill and Baby Point and nearby destinations such as the Bloor West Health Centre, St. Pius X Catholic School, St. Olave&#x27;s Anglican Church, Windermere United Church and Jane/Dundas Public Library.

==Surface connections==
The station&#x27;s bus platform is not within the fare-paid area.

TTC routes serving the station include:
==Transit City LRT plan==
The now-cancelled Transit City proposal called for a new LRT line known as the Jane LRT line, running along Jane Street from Pioneer Village station to Jane station.

<doc id="1305765" wikidata="Q901342" url="?curid=1305765" title="Minami Osaka Line">
<text>is a railway line operated by Kintetsu Railway. It runs between in Osaka and in Kashihara, Nara Prefecture. The line connects Osaka to southern part of the Nara Basin, running through Osaka&#x27;s southern suburb cities of Matsubara, Fujiidera and Habikino in Osaka Prefecture, and Katsuragi and Yamato-Takada in Nara Prefecture. Via the Yoshino Line, it also provides access to the Yoshino refuge of Emperor Godaigo, a popular tourist destination, especially during the spring.

The line and its network of branch lines use narrow gauge tracks, the only lines in the Kintetsu network with this gauge. Other Kintetsu lines use standard gauge.

==History==
The first section of the line opened in 1898 between Kashiwara Station and Furuichi Station by . The next year took over the line, before renaming itself . The railway then constructed its own access line to Osaka center, completed in 1923 and electrified at 1,500 V DC, then the highest voltage in Japan. An extension to Nara Prefecture to what is now Kashiharajingū-mae station was built in 1929 and through service began to the Yoshino Railway, now the Yoshino Line. 

The entire route competed with the existing Osaka Line, operated by Kansai Kyūkō Electric Railway, or Kankyū. In 1943, Osaka Railway was merged with Kankyū and the Minami Osaka Line continued to operate as part of the Kankyū network. Kankyū would later rename itself in 1944 to the Kinki Nippon Railway, or Kintetsu, after merging with the Nankai Electric Railway. 

==Operations==
Some trains go through to the Nagano Line or the Yoshino Line, some operate between Furuichi and Gose Station on the Gose Line, and some from Gose run through to Osaka Abenobashi. Local trains run between Osaka Abenobashi and Fujiidera or Furuichi, and between Furuichi and Kashiharajingū-mae (including conductorless trains between Furuichi and Kashiharajingū-mae).

===Rapid service===
Local train (普通 Futsu)

Running all day, but the operation is divided at Furuichi station except in the early morning and late night. 

Osaka-Abenobashi-Furuichi
Osaka Abenobashi - Fujiidera or Furuichi is the basic operating pattern, with four trains per hour between Osaka-Abenobashi and Fujiidera during the day, along with two additional trains between Osaka Abenobashi and Furuichi.

Local trains are overtaken by Semi express trains at Imagawa, and by Limited Express or express trains at Kawachi Amami.

Furuichi-Kashiharajingu-Mae or Yoshino
Normal operation is between Furuichi and Kashihara Jingu-mae. Some trains continue to Yoshino on the Yoshino Line in early morning and late nights.

In this section semi-express trains make all stops, but few trains operate here as most run on the Nagano Line after Furuichi. Local and semi-express trains to Osaka Abenobashi twice per hour alternate to provide constant daytime service. There is a direct connection from the Gose Line at Shakudo, and some trains run between Shakudo and Kashihara Jingu-mae only on weekday mornings.

; (SmE)

Semi-express trains operate between Osaka Abenobashi - Kashihara Jingu-mae or Kawachinagano. Two trains per hour run to Kashihara Jingu-mae and four to Kawachinagano.

<text>Runnymede is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located just north of Bloor Street West, spanning the block east of Runnymede Road to Kennedy Avenue, with bus platforms at the surface level and entrances at both ends.

==History==
The station opened in 1968 as part of the westerly extension of the subway line from Keele to Islington station.

Extensive rehabilitation of the concrete station structure was undertaken in 2010. This work involved replacing the concrete slab and columns of the bus platform, and the bus driveway structural paving.

Installation of three elevators to make the station fully accessible commenced in late November 2018. The construction took two years to complete.

==Description==

The station has two entrances, one on Runnymede Road and the other at Kennedy Avenue. The station is barrier free from the street to the bus platforms. The bus platforms are not in a fare-paid area. The station has three levels: street, concourse and platform.

<text>High Park is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located just north of Bloor Street West, spanning the block east of Quebec Avenue to High Park Avenue. It opened in 1968 as part of the westerly extension from to Islington station.
==Station description==
The station is mostly underground, lying behind the properties which face on to the north side of Bloor Street. The main entrance is from Quebec Avenue at the westerly end of the surface bus transfer area, with the ticketing mezzanine one level below, above the east end of the train platforms. The station has escalators here, but despite having ramps at the street entrance it does not have elevators to provide access to the platforms for those with physical disabilities. A second entrance from High Park Avenue is at the east end of the bus platform, which is convenient for those needing to cross Bloor Street at the traffic lights to get to and from High Park.

The west end is at ground level, with an apartment building constructed partially over the station and along the south side. Just west of the station, Parkview Gardens is divided by the surface subway tracks and there are two entrances; one on the north side leading to Clendenan Avenue and another on the south leading to Bloor Street. Admission and exit at this end of the station is underground through unstaffed turnstiles.

The original external signage and trim has a unique bright blue background colour, whereas standard stations are red. In 2009 the station title nameboard over the entrance on Quebec Avenue was converted to the current style of a black background, white lettering and a stripe of green to signify the Bloor–Danforth line, but the other entrances still retain the old ones.

Rehabilitation of the station has included repairs to the roof slab and repaving. Original deteriorating walls and fences were replaced with sound barriers along the bus transfer area and beyond the west end of the station platforms.

=== Station access upgrades ===
Construction at High Park station began on June 20, 2022, to install two new elevators, improve signage, install security cameras along the accessible pathway, and build a new main entrance structure and automatic sliding doors. The Quebec Avenue entrance is closed for duration of construction. Construction is expected to be completed by mid-2025.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include High Park and Humberside Collegiate Institute. The High Park Mineral Baths was demolished in 1962 to make way for the subway line. It was opened in 1913 as part of a sanatorium but eventually became a public pool.

<doc id="1305769" wikidata="Q3431263" url="?curid=1305769" title="Richard Taverner">
<text>Richard Taverner (1505 – 14 July 1575) was an English author and religious reformer.

He is best known for his Bible translation, commonly known as Taverner&#x27;s Bible, but originally titled .

==Life and works==
Taverner was born at Brisley (about 20 miles northwest of Norwich). He studied at Corpus Christi College and Cardinal College at the University of Oxford, later earning at an MA at Cambridge University. He entered the Inner Temple to study law in 1534.

Later, under Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s direction, Taverner became actively engaged in producing works designed to encourage the Reformation in England, which included the publication of his translation of the Bible in 1539, and a commentary published in 1540 with Henry VIII&#x27;s approval. Taverner&#x27;s Bible was largely a revision of the Matthew Bible. Taverner brought strong Greek scholarship to the task, but his Hebrew was not as good as his Greek, so that the revisions of the New Testament are considered better than those of the Old. In 1539, Taverner published &quot;Proverbs or Adages by Desiderius Erasmus Gathered out of the Chiliades and Englished&quot;, which was reprinted several times.

Cromwell&#x27;s fall (and subsequent execution) in 1540 put an end to Taverner&#x27;s literary output and endangered his position. On 2 December 1541 he was sent to the Tower of London by Henry VIII for failing to pass on a report that Anne of Cleves was pregnant with the King&#x27;s child after their divorce. Soon after, he was released again. He submitted to the King and was restored to royal favour. In 1544 he both served in the French campaign and acquired the manor of Wood Eaton in Oxfordshire and a house at Norbiton, Surrey.

Under Edward VI, when preachers were scarce, Taverner obtained a licence as a lay preacher. He was also listed as the Member of Parliament for Liverpool in 1547. Though an ardent supporter of the Reformation, Taverner had no intention of becoming a martyr. When Queen Mary came to the throne in 1553, he welcomed her with &quot;An Oration Gratulatory&quot;. After losing his position at court, he quietly disappeared from public life during her reign. Upon the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558, he addressed a congratulatory epistle to her, refused a knighthood she offered him, and preached regularly at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Oxford. He served as Justice of the Peace for Oxfordshire from 1558 until his death and was appointed High Sheriff of Oxfordshire for 1569–70.

Richard Taverner died on 14 July 1575 and was buried in the chancel of the church at Wood Eaton near Oxford.

==Family==
The eldest of Richard&#x27;s younger brothers, Roger Taverner (d. 1572), was a surveyor and writer, and Richard&#x27;s second son Peter, who established himself at Hexton, Hertfordshire, fathered John Taverner (1584–1638), an Anglican clergyman. Anthony Wood, a great-grandson, was an antiquarian.

<text>Dundas West is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located just north of Bloor Street West at the corner of Dundas Street and Edna Avenue. The station is about 200 metres west of Bloor GO Station on the GO Transit Kitchener line and the Union Pearson Express.

The station, which is the northwestern terminus of the 504A King and 505 Dundas streetcar routes, has two streetcar platforms and five bus bays to allow riders to transfer between connecting routes. Wi-Fi service is available at this station. A McDonald&#x27;s restaurant serves the station, with access from both the fare-paid and non-fare-paid areas of the station&#x27;s upper level, and there is a Gateway Newstand on the mezzanine level.

==Overview==

To the east of the station, the subway runs in a twin-bored tunnel until just before the next station (Lansdowne). This allowed the tracks to pass underneath nearby railway lines without disturbing them during construction. To the west, the tracks follow a short &quot;cut and cover&quot; tunnel before emerging outside at the &quot;Dorval Portal&quot;. Trains run in the open air until they enter Keele Station.

The four tunnels comprising the Vincent Subway Yard are underground and south of the subway platforms. This station also houses the Subway Track Maintenance Office, which is located on the Mezzanine level.

Nearby landmarks include The Crossways residential and retail complex, Bishop Marrocco/Thomas Merton Catholic Secondary School, The Lithuanian House banquet hall, Roncesvalles and The Junction neighbourhoods.

==History==
Dundas West station opened in 1966 as a part of the initial segment of the Bloor–Danforth line between and .

In 2002, as part of a scheduled reconstruction of the streetcar tracks on Dundas Street, a second streetcar track and platform were added to improve reliability on both the 504 King and 505 Dundas streetcar routes. Until the completion of the second track, a streetcar waiting in the station on either route could hold up vehicles on the other. At the same time, elevators were added, making the station wheelchair-accessible.

Following controversy over the namesake of Dundas StreetHenry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, who delayed the abolition of the transatlantic slave tradeToronto City Council voted in 2021 to rename Dundas Street and other civic assets named after Dundas, such as Dundas West station. A new name was to be chosen in April 2022. In December 2023, citing costs, Toronto ultimately decided to keep Dundas&#x27; name for the street but to rename Yonge-Dundas Square and the two subway stations named after him, Dundas and Dundas West.

In April 2022, the streetcar loop was closed for two months to replace track and to extend the 505 streetcar platform to accommodate two Flexity Outlook streetcars.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTC-2022/04/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SteveMunro-2022/04/06&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

TTC routes serving the station include:
==Connection to Bloor GO station==
Metrolinx has contracted to build a connection between Dundas West station and the nearby Bloor GO Station via a new pedestrian tunnel at the east end of the subway platforms. Customers transferring from the TTC to GO/UPX need to walk east along city streets from the only station entrance at the west end of the subway platforms. The new tunnel will shorten that distance to . The work includes:
* a new concourse in the lower level of The Crossways’ building
* elevator access to the TTC platform level
* two elevators and a stairwell to connect GO’s Bloor tunnel to a new TTC concourse
* an electrical backup system in case of power outages

Metrolinx began proceedings to expropriate necessary properties for a pedestrian tunnel in September 2017. Metrolinx intended to start construction in 2018, but this was delayed when the ownership of the Crossways changed hands. Metrolinx expected property within the Crossways&#x27; parking garage necessary for tunnel construction to be transferred to Metrolinx in 2019. By August 2023, the contract to construct the pedestrian connection between the two stations was awarded to Kenaidan Contractors Ltd. Construction on the tunnel began in May 2024.

In 2011, Metrolinx predicted there would be 2,000 transfers between the two stations by 2031. , there were approximately 600 daily transfers.

<doc id="1305772" wikidata="Q7261" url="?curid=1305772" title="Payakumbuh">
<text>Payakumbuh (, Jawi: ) is the second largest city in West Sumatra province, Indonesia, with a population of 116,825 at the 2010 Census and 139,576 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 144,830 - comprising 72,840 males and 71,990 females. It covers an area of 80.42 km² and is in the Minangkabau Highlands, 120 km by road from the West Sumatran capital city of Padang and 180 km from the Riau capital city of Pekanbaru. 

The whole area is surrounded on all sides by (but administratively independent from) the Lima Puluh Kota Regency, making it an enclave. It is located near the volcanoes of Mount Merapi, Mount Sago, and Bukit Barisan. Payakumbuh means &quot;grassy swamp&quot; in the Minangkabau language., suggesting that the area was originally swampy. 

In 2011, Payakumbuh had the highest economic growth of any city in West Sumatra. Innovations in sanitation, waste management, healthy traditional markets, street vendors coaching, and urban drainage resulted in this city being awarded the &quot;Urban Innovation Management&quot; in 2012. In 2013, Payakumbuh received the &quot;Adipura&quot; (&#x27;cleanest city&#x27;) award in the category of small city for the seventh time.

Payakumbuh is known for flying duck races, foods like &quot;batiah&quot; (small sweet rice cookies), &quot;gelamai&quot; (a sweet coconut palm sugared snack) and &quot;rendang&quot;. Payakumbuh produces a wide range of agriculture products including rice, milk, cattle and palm sugar.

Payakumbuh and its surrounding villages, namely Mungka, Simalanggang and Batuhampar are the origin of the Negeri Sembilan people of Malaysia.

==Transportation==

Payakumbuh is connected to Padang and Pekanbaru by road; a dysfunctional railway line also exists. For inner-city transport, Payakumbuh employs a public transportation system known as &quot;Sago&quot;, taken from name of a nearby volcano (Mount Sago) in Payakumbuh. In addition, transport within the city occurs in the form of horse-drawn carts known as bendi.

==Administrative districts==
The city is administratively divided into five administrative districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), 8 &quot;kanagarian&quot;, and 47 villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;). A mayor (&quot;walikota&quot;) leads the city administration.
The districts are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the administrative centres and the number of urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district.

==Tourism==
Payakumbuh is considered as one of the most popular cities in West Sumatra for domestic and foreign tourists. The varieties of food, the Muslim clothes stores, and natural scenery are some of the attractions of the city. Attractions within and surrounding the city include:
* &quot;Harau Valley:&quot; A karstic valley with immense, steep cliffs and spectacular waterfalls. Rock climbing is quite popular in this area due to the ideal conditions of the precipices.
* &quot;Ngalau Indah Caverns and Caves:&quot; Caves with fantastic stalactites and stalagmites and including views of Payakumbuh and its surroundings.
* &quot;Kepala Bonda:&quot; Site which can be visited for bamboo river-rafting.
* &quot;Rumah Godang Sungai Baringin&quot;, a large and splendid rumah gadang (a traditional home of the Minangkabau people), located between rice fields
* &quot;Koto Nan Ampek Old Mosque:&quot; Among the oldest mosques in West Sumatra, characterized by traditional Minangkabau architecture.
* &quot;Museum Rumah Kelahiran Tan Malaka&quot; (Museum of Tan Malaka Birthplace): the house in which Indonesian founding father Tan Malaka was born.

<text>Keele is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located just north of Bloor Street West on the east side of Keele Street. The station opened in 1966, and was the western terminus of the line until 1968.

==History==
When the Bloor–Danforth line was opened in 1966 from Keele to Woodbine station, the Bloor streetcar line was dramatically shortened. It now traveled east from Jane Loop only as far as Keele station; at the eastern end of the line, a separate Danforth streetcar was established, from Woodbine station to Luttrell Loop.
On May 11, 1968, the Bloor and Danforth streetcars were both eliminated when the subway extensions west to and east to were opened. During this initial two-year period the trolleybuses and streetcars serving the station used separate loops (both within the fare-paid area), one near each of the station&#x27;s entrances, so that passengers transferring between streetcars and trolleybuses had to walk along the subway platform. While the main (Keele Street) entrance and trolleybus loop had escalators up to the platform, the east (parking lot and Indian Grove) entrance and streetcar loop were provided with a moving ramp leading up to what is now the eastbound subway platform. After streetcar service to the station ended in 1968, the streetcar loop property was redeveloped and the moving ramp was sealed off. The former trolleybus loop is still used, by buses.

Installation of two elevators to make the station fully accessible commenced in August 2019. The construction was completed in July 2021, with Keele becoming the TTC&#x27;s 53rd accessible station.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
Just east of Keele Street, the line emerges from a hillside, changing directly from tunnel to an elevated alignment on an enclosed bridge, then enters the station. The fully enclosed station crosses over both Keele Street and a parallel side street named Indian Grove. Just east of the station the line emerges onto an open viaduct, with a 187 space parking lot located underneath at 400 Indian Road. The line then continues at ground level beside Keele Yard (formerly called Vincent Yard), before descending into the Dorval Portal as it continues to Dundas West station.

==Nearby landmarks==

Nearby landmarks include High Park and Keele Junior Public School. The neighbourhood of The Junction is located north of the station.

<text>Lansdowne is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The main station entrance is located just north of Bloor Street on Lansdowne Avenue, with a secondary unstaffed entrance on Emerson Avenue. Opened in 1966, the station lies approximately 561 metres (1,842 feet) from its nearest station to the west, Dundas West. The station is in the Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction neighbourhood on the edge of the Bloordale Village strip.

Construction started in June 2019 to install three elevators to make Lansdowne station accessible. One elevator was planned to connect the street level to the station concourse. Two other elevators were planned to connect the concourse to the east- and westbound platforms. In December 2022, the project was completed as planned and the station became accessible. As part of the project, the station received public art.

Under a GO Transit proposal for GO Expansion, a new station on their Barrie line (tentatively called ) would be built west of this station and offer connections between the services.

==Surface connections==

Transfers to buses occur at curbside stops on Lansdowne Avenue at this station.

<doc id="1305778" wikidata="Q2418473" url="?curid=1305778" title="Hindu Mahasabha">
<text>Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha () is a Hindu nationalist political party in India.

Founded in 1915 by Madan Mohan Malviya, the Mahasabha functioned mainly as a pressure group advocating the interests of Orthodox Hindus before the British Raj from within the Indian National Congress. In the 1930s, it emerged as a distinct party under the leadership of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, who developed the concept of Hindutva () and became a fierce opponent of the western, secular nationalism espoused by the Congress.

During the World War II, the Mahasabha supported the British war effort and briefly entered coalitions with the Muslim League in provincial and central legislative councils. They opposed the integration of the princely states into India. After the assassination of Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi by a Hindu Mahasabha activist Nathuram Godse, the Mahasabha&#x27;s fortunes diminished in post-Independence Indian politics, and it was soon eclipsed by the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.

==Name==
The organisation was originally called &quot;Sarvadeshik Hindu Sabha&quot; (&quot;Pan-Country Hindu Assembly&quot;). In 1921, it changed to the present name &quot;Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha&quot; (&quot;All-India Hindu Grand Assembly&quot;).

==History==
===Antecedents===
Local forerunners of the Hindu Mahasabha emerged in connection with the disputes after the partition of Bengal in 1905 in British India. Under the then viceroy Lord Curzon, the division of the province of Bengal was into two new provinces of East Bengal and Assam, as well as Bengal. The new province of Bengal had a Hindu majority, the province of East Bengal and Assam was mostly Muslim. The British administration justified the division for religious reasons.

The formation of the All India Muslim League in 1906 and the British India government&#x27;s creation of separate Muslim electorate under the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 was a catalyst for Hindu leaders coming together to create an organisation to protect the rights of the Hindu community members.

In 1909, Lal Chand and U.N. Mukerji established the Punjab Hindu Sabha (&quot;Punjab Hindu Assembly&quot;). The Sabha stated that it was not a sectarian organisation, but an &quot;all-embracing movement&quot; that aimed to safeguard the interests of &quot;the entire Hindu community&quot;. On 21–22 October 1909, it organised the Punjab Provincial Hindu Conference, which criticised the Indian National Congress for failing to defend Hindu interests and called for the promotion of Hindu-centered politics. In this conference, Sabha leaders strongly proposed that Hindus need a separate nation and that Muslims should not be given any rights in that nation. The Sabha organised five more annual provincial conferences in Punjab.

The development of the broad civic framework for Hindu unity that started in the early 20th century in Punjab was a precursor for the formation of the All India Hindu Sabha. Over the next few years, several such Hindu Sabhas were established outside Punjab, including in United Provinces, Bihar, Bengal, Central Provinces and Berar, and Bombay Presidency.

A formal move to establish an umbrella All-India Hindu Sabha was made at the Allahabad session of Congress in 1910. A committee headed by Lala Baij Nath was set up to draw a constitution, but it did not make much progress. Another conference of Hindu leaders in Allahabad also took the initial step to establish an All India Hindu Sabha in 1910, but this organisation did not become operational due to factional strife. On 8 December 1913, the Punjab Hindu Sabha passed a resolution to create an All India Hindu Sabha at its Ambala session. The Conference proposed holding a general conference of Hindu leaders from all over India during 1915 Kumbh Mela in Haridwar.

===Establishment===
Preparatory sessions of the All India Hindu Sabha were held at Haridwar (13 February 1915), Lucknow (17 February 1915) and Delhi (27 February 1915). In April 1915, &quot;Sarvadeshak&quot; (All India) Hindu Sabha was formed as an umbrella organisation of regional Hindu Sabhas, at the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. Gandhi and Swami Shraddhanand were also present at the conference and were supportive of the formation of All India Hindu Sabha. The Sabha emphasized Hindu solidarity and the need for social reform.

At its sixth session in April 1921, the &quot;Sarvadeshak Hindu Sabha&quot; formally changed its name to &quot;Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha&quot; on the model of the Indian National Congress. Presided over by Manindra Chandra Nandi, it amended its constitution to remove the clause about loyalty to the British and added a clause committing the organisation to a &quot;united and self-governing&quot; Indian nation.

Amongst the Mahasabha&#x27;s early leaders were the prominent nationalists, educationalists and 
four-time Indian National Congress president Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, who founded the Benaras Hindu University, the Punjabi populist Lala Lajpat Rai and Lajpat Rai&#x27;s mentor Navin Chandra Rai of the Hindu Samaj who chaired the special Congress session of 1920 held at Lahore which gave the call for non-cooperation. Under Malaviya, the Mahasabha campaigned for Hindu political unity, for the education and economic development of Hindus as well as for the conversion of Muslims to Hinduism.

===Indian independence movement===

The Hindu Mahasabha did not unconditionally support the Indian independence movement against British rule in India. However, it became part of the movement on its conditions and with regards to protecting the interests of the Hindus. For example, it boycotted the Simon Commission. In the aftermath, it was part of the all-party committee, which came out with the Nehru Report. However, it did not accept the Report as according to Mahasabha, it gave too many concessions to Muslims. Similarly, when Mahatma Gandhi observed a fast against the Communal Award, Mahasabha worked with Gandhi and other parties to ensure Poona Pact was signed and Depressed Classes were given a fair representation.

Hindu Mahasabha opposed the Quit India Movement. Under Savarkar&#x27;s leadership, the party organised &quot;Hindu Militarization Boards&quot; which recruited for the British Indian armed forces in World War 2.

====Civil disobedience movement====
Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress led several nationwide campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience. The Mahasabha officially abstained from participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930.

====Alliance with Muslim League and others====
The Indian National Congress won a massive victory in the 1937 Indian provincial elections, decimating the Hindu Mahasabha. However, in 1939, the Congress ministries resigned in protest against Viceroy Lord Linlithgow&#x27;s action of declaring India to be a belligerent in the Second World War without consulting the Indian people. This led to the Hindu Mahasabha joining hands with the Muslim League and other parties to form governments, in certain provinces. Such coalition governments were formed in Sindh, NWFP, and Bengal.

In Sindh, Hindu Mahasabha members joined Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah&#x27;s Muslim League government. In Savarkar&#x27;s own words:Witness the fact that only recently in Sind, the Sind-Hindu-Sabha on invitation had taken the responsibility of joining hands with the League itself in running coalition government... In March 1943, Sindh Government became the first Provincial Assembly of the sub-continent to pass an official resolution in favour of the creation of Pakistan. Despite the Hindu Mahasabha&#x27;s avowed public opposition to any territorial division of India, the Mahasabha Ministers of the Sindh government did not resign, rather they simply &quot;contented themselves with a protest&quot;.

In the North West Frontier Province, Hindu Mahasabha members joined hands with Sardar Aurang Zeb Khan of the Muslim League to form a government in 1943. The Mahasabha member of the cabinet was Finance Minister Mehr Chand Khanna.

In Bengal, Hindu Mahasabha joined the Krishak Praja Party led Progressive Coalition ministry of Fazlul Haq in December 1941. Savarkar appreciated the successful functioning of the coalition government.

====Quit India Movement====
The Hindu Mahasabha openly opposed the call for the Quit India Movement and boycotted it officially. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the president of the Hindu Mahasabha at that time, even went to the extent of writing a letter titled &quot;Stick to your Posts&quot;, in which he instructed Hindu Sabhaites who happened to be &quot;members of municipalities, local bodies, legislatures or those serving in the army...to stick to their posts&quot; across the country, and not to join the Quit India Movement at any cost.

Following the Hindu Mahasabha&#x27;s official decision to boycott the Quit India movement, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, leader of the Hindu Mahasabha in Bengal (which was a part of the ruling coalition in Bengal led by Krishak Praja Party of Fazlul Haq), wrote a letter to the British Government as to how they should respond, if the Congress gave a call to the British rulers to Quit India. In this letter, dated July 26, 1942, he wrote: Let me now refer to the situation that may be created in the province as a result of any widespread movement launched by the Congress. Anybody, who during the war, plans to stir up mass feeling, resulting in internal disturbances or insecurity, must be resisted by any Government that may function for the time being. Mookerjee in this letter reiterated that the Fazlul Haq led Bengal Government, along with its alliance partner Hindu Mahasabha would make every possible effort to defeat the Quit India Movement in the province of Bengal and made a concrete proposal as regards this: The question is how to combat this movement (Quit India) in Bengal? The administration of the province should be carried on in such a manner that in spite of the best efforts of the Congress, this movement will fail to take root in the province. It should be possible for us, especially responsible Ministers, to be able to tell the public that the freedom for which the Congress has started the movement, already belongs to the representatives of the people. In some spheres, it might be limited during the emergency. Indians have to trust the British, not for the sake for Britain, not for any advantage that the British might gain, but for the maintenance of the defence and freedom of the province itself. You, as Governor, will function as the constitutional head of the province and will be guided entirely on the advice of your Minister. Even the Indian historian R.C. Majumdar noted this fact and states: Syama Prasad ended the letter with a discussion of the mass movement organised by the Congress. He expressed the apprehension that the movement would create internal disorder and will endanger internal security during the war by exciting popular feeling and he opined that any government in power has to suppress it, but that according to him could not be done only by persecution... In that letter, he mentioned item-wise the steps to be taken for dealing with the situation...

===Princely states===

Hindu Mahasabha took funding from the princely states and supported them to remain independent even after the independence of India. Savarkar particularly hailed the Hindu dominated states as the &#x27;bedrock of Hindu power&#x27; and defended their despotic powers, referring to them as the &#x27;citadels of organised Hindu power&#x27;. He particularly hailed the princely states such as Mysore State, Travancore, Oudh and Baroda State as &#x27;progressive Hindu states&#x27;.

===Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi===
On January 30, 1948, Nathuram Godse shot Mahatma Gandhi three times and killed him in Delhi. Godse and his fellow conspirators Digambar Badge, Gopal Godse, Narayan Apte, Vishnu Karkare and Madanlal Pahwa were identified as prominent members of the Hindu Mahasabha. Along with them, police arrested Savarkar, who was suspected of being the mastermind behind the plot. While the trial resulted in convictions and judgments against the others, Savarkar was released due to lack of evidence. The Kapur Commission said:
: All these facts taken together were destructive of any theory other than the conspiracy to murder (of Gandhiji).

===Attempts at rehabilitation of Godse===
The Hindu Mahasabha considers Nathuram Godse to be a &quot;real forgotten hero&quot; of the independence struggle of India and criticises Mahatma Gandhi for not having prevented the partition of India. In 2014, following the Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s rise to power, the Hindu Mahasabha continued attempts to rehabilitate and portray him as a patriot. It requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to install the bust of Nathuram Godse. It created a documentary film &quot;Desh Bhakt Nathuram Godse&quot; (Patriot Nathuram Godse) for release on the death anniversary of Gandhi on 30 January 2015.
There were attempts to build a temple for Nathuram Godse and to celebrate 30 January as a &quot;Shaurya Diwas&quot; (&quot;Bravery Day&quot;). A civil suit was filed in Pune Court asking for a ban on the documentary film.

===Karnataka controversy===
In September 2021, the state general secretary for Hindu Mahasabha in Karnataka, Dharmendra, threatened to kill Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai over the demolition of an unlicensed temple in Nanjangud, Mysuru, along with comments about killing Mahatma Gandhi. For these threats, he and two other associates, Rajesh Pavitran and Prem Poolali, were arrested.

==Ideology==
Although the Hindu Mahasabha did not call for the exclusion of other religious communities from government, it identified India as a &quot;Hindu Rashtra&quot; (&quot;Hindu Nation&quot;) and believed in the primacy of Hindu culture, religion, and heritage. The Hindu Mahasabha was opposed to the Indian caste system and policies that endorsed untouchability, and used to organize all caste dinners in Nagpur and Kanpur.

===Hindutva===
The Hindu Mahasabha promotes the principles of Hindutva, a Hindu nationalist ideology developed by its pre-eminent leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. The Mahasabha identifies India as &quot;Hindu Rashtra&quot; (&quot;Hindu Nation&quot;).

===Ideological positions===
In 2015, Vice President of All India Hindu Mahasabha, VP Sadhvi Deva Thakur stated that Christians and Muslims must undergo forced sterilization to restrict their growing population in India, which she considered a threat to Hindus. She declared: &quot;The population of Muslims and Christians is growing day by day. To rein in this, Union will have to impose emergency, and Muslims and Christians will have to be forced to undergo sterilization so that they can&#x27;t increase their numbers&quot;.

In April 2015, the general secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha Munna Kumar Shukla claimed that it is not illegal to attack a church and it does not violate any law. He requested the NDA government to give legal and administrative protection to the Hindus who attack churches. He justified his claim by saying that churches were only conversion factories. Shukla also promised the Mahasabha would give protection and awards to those who marry Muslim girls and attack churches. He also said that the Taj Mahal would meet the same fate as Babri masjid as it was a Shiva Temple.

<text>Dufferin is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at Dufferin Street just north of Bloor Street West. It opened in 1966 as part of the original segment of the subway line.

==Architecture and art==

When the station first opened, the entrance on the west side of Dufferin Street had a tile back wall, a three sided glass and aluminium enclosure entrance at ground level, an opaque flat roof, red signage, and a red accent stripe. In 1974, the Dovercourt Baptist Church constructed the abutting new red brick facility and senior&#x27;s residence (New Horizons Tower). The entrance on the east side of the street is inset into the westerly facade of the Bloor Dufferin Medical Centre. Inside, smooth, unadorned green-coloured rectangular wall tiles were used, with a strip of narrower black tiles near the ceiling, and terrazzo floor tiles.

The 2010 to 2014 modernization of the station significantly modifies the original west entrance, updating signage, adding an elevator for accessibility, adding ceiling height and additional glazed elements, and adding a canopy covering the sidewalk. A canopy has also been added to the Bloor Dufferin Medical Centre to shelter the east side bus stops, and two additional exits have been added to Russet Ave, one block west of the main entrances. A public art component, titled &quot;Something Happens Here&quot; by Eduardo Aquino and Karen Shanski of spmb was also added, consisting of colourful mosaics of highly pixelated images of activity from the surrounding communities. The mosaics also include numerous metallic tiles featuring local logos, icons and historical references.

==Nearby landmarks==

Nearby landmarks include Dufferin Mall, Bloor Collegiate Institute, Dufferin Grove Park, and the Bloor–Gladstone branch of the Toronto Public Library.

==Surface connections==
Transfers to buses occur at curbside stops on Dufferin Street outside the station.

TTC routes serving the station include:
==Station modernization==
Dufferin Station was upgraded and modernized under the TTC&#x27;s &quot;Station Modernization&quot; program. Work commenced in September 2009 and was fully complete in November 2014, taking over twice the projected time to complete. The &quot;modernization&quot; included the installation of street level elevators for accessibility, the installation of a second entrance from Russett Avenue, two second exits (one on the northwest corner of Russet Avenue and Bloor Street, and the other on the northeast corner, providing direct access from the westbound platform), rebuilding of the bus waiting area, and new and modernized station finishes, art and lighting. The two second exits opened earlier than other improvements, in August 2013.

By January 2024, the TTC and a developer came to an agreement that the developer would construct, maintain and own a new station connection from a new 33-storey, mixed-use development, to be built on the southwest corner of Bloor and Dufferin Streets. The connection will be accessible and underground, and is expected to open in 2026.

<doc id="1305787" wikidata="Q5251439" url="?curid=1305787" title="Fielding independent pitching">
<text>In baseball, fielding independent pitching (FIP) (also referred to as defense independent pitching (DIP)) is intended to measure a pitcher&#x27;s effectiveness based only on statistics that do not involve fielders (except the catcher). These include home runs allowed, strikeouts, hit batters, walks, and, more recently, fly ball percentage, ground ball percentage, and (to a much lesser extent) line drive percentage. By focusing on these statistics and ignoring what happens once a ball is put in play, which – on most plays – the pitcher has little control over, DIP claims to offer a clearer picture of the pitcher&#x27;s true ability.

The most controversial part of DIP is the idea that pitchers have little influence over what happens to balls that are put into play. Some people believe this has been well-established (see below), primarily by showing the large variability of most pitchers&#x27; BABIP from year to year. However, there is a wide variation in career BABIP among pitchers, and this seems to correlate with career success. For instance, no pitcher in the Hall of Fame has a below-average career BABIP.

==Formulae==
Each of the following formulae uses innings pitched (IP), a measure of the number of outs a team made while a pitcher was in the game. Since most outs rely on fielding, the results from calculations using IP are not truly independent of team defense. While the creators of DICE, FIP and similar statistics all suggest they are &quot;defense independent&quot;, others have pointed out that their formulas involve (IP). IP is a statistical measure of how many outs were made while a pitcher was pitching. This includes those made by fielders who are typically involved in more than two thirds of the outs. These critics claim this makes pitchers&#x27; DICE or FIP highly dependent on the defensive play of their fielders.

===DICE===
A simple formula, known as Defense-Independent Component ERA (DICE), was created by Clay Dreslough in 1998:

:formula_1

In that equation, &quot;HR&quot; is home runs, &quot;BB&quot; is walks, &quot;HBP&quot; is hit batters, &quot;K&quot; is strikeouts, and &quot;IP&quot; is innings pitched. That equation gives a number that is better at predicting a pitcher&#x27;s ERA in the following year than the pitcher&#x27;s actual ERA in the current year.

===FIP===
Tom Tango independently derived a similar formula, known as Fielding Independent Pitching, which is very close to the results of dERA and DICE.

:formula_2

In that equation, &quot;HR&quot; is home runs, &quot;BB&quot; is walks, &quot;K&quot; is strikeouts, and &quot;IP&quot; is innings pitched. That equation usually gives a number that is nothing close to a normal ERA (this is the FIP core), so the equation used is more often (but not always) this one:

:formula_3

where C is a constant that renders league FIP for the time period in question equal to league ERA for the same period. It is calculated as:

:formula_4

where lgERA is the league average ERA, lgHR is the number of home runs in the league, lgBB is the number of walks in the league, lgK is the number of strikeouts in the league, and lgIP is the number of innings pitched in the league.

The Hardball Times, a popular baseball statistics website, uses a slightly different FIP equation, instead using 3*(BB+HBP-IBB) rather than simply 3*(BB) where &quot;HBP&quot; stands for batters hit by pitch and &quot;IBB&quot; stands for intentional base on balls.

===xFIP===

Dave Studeman of The Hardball Times derived Expected Fielding Independent Pitching (xFIP), a regressed version of FIP. Calculated like FIP, it differs in that it normalizes the number of home runs the pitcher allows, replacing a pitcher&#x27;s actual home run total with an expected home run total (xHR).

:formula_5

where xHR is calculated using the league average home run per fly ball rate (lgHR/FB) multiplied by the number of fly balls the pitcher has allowed.

:formula_6

Typically, the lgHR/FB is around 10.5%, meaning 10.5% of fly balls go for home runs. In 2015, it was 11.4%.

===SIERA===

Baseball Prospectus invented this statistic, which takes into account balls in play and adjusts for balls in play. For example, if a pitcher has a high xFIP, but also induces a lot of ground balls and popups, his SIERA will be lower than his xFIP. The calculations for it are as follows:

:formula_7
where SO is strikeouts, PA is plate appearances, BB is bases on balls, GB is ground ball, FB is fly ball, and PU is pop-up

==Origins==
In 1999, Voros McCracken became the first to detail and publicize these effects to the baseball research community when he wrote on rec.sport.baseball, &quot;I&#x27;ve been working on a pitching evaluation tool and thought I&#x27;d post it here to get some feedback. I call it &#x27;Defensive Independent Pitching&#x27; and what it does is evaluate a pitcher base[d] strictly on the statistics his defense has no ability to affect...&quot; Until the publication of a more widely read article in 2001, however, on Baseball Prospectus, most of the baseball research community believed that individual pitchers had an inherent ability to prevent hits on balls in play. McCracken reasoned that if this ability existed, it would be noticeable in a pitcher&#x27;s &#x27;Batting Average on Balls In Play&#x27; (BABIP). His research found the opposite to be true: that while a pitcher&#x27;s ability to cause strikeouts or prevent home runs remained somewhat constant from season to season, his ability to prevent hits on balls in play did not.

To better evaluate pitchers in light of his theory, McCracken developed &quot;Defense-Independent ERA&quot; (dERA), the most well-known defense-independent pitching statistic. McCracken&#x27;s formula for dERA is very complicated, with a number of steps. DIP ERA is not as useful for knuckleballers and other &quot;trick&quot; pitchers, a factor that McCracken mentioned a few days after his original announcement of his research findings in 1999, in a posting on the rec.sport.baseball.analysis Usenet site on November 23, 1999, when he wrote: &quot;Also to [note] is that, anecdotally, I believe pitchers with trick deliveries (e.g. Knuckleballers) might post consistently lower $H numbers than other pitchers. I looked at Tim Wakefield&#x27;s career and that seems to bear out slightly&quot;.

In later postings on the rec.sport.baseball site during 1999 and 2000 (prior to the publication of his widely read article on BaseballProspectus.com in 2001), McCracken also discussed other pitcher characteristics that might influence BABIP. In 2002 McCracken created and published version 2.0 of dERA, which incorporates the ability of knuckleballers and other types of pitchers to affect the number of hits allowed on balls hit in the field of play (BHFP).

==Controversy==
Controversy over DIP was heightened when Tom Tippett at Diamond Mind published his own findings in 2003. Tippett concluded that the differences between pitchers in preventing hits on balls in play were at least partially the result of the pitcher&#x27;s skill. Tippett analyzed certain groups of pitchers that appear to be able to reduce the number of hits allowed on balls hit into the field of play (BHFP). Like McCracken, Tippett found that pitchers&#x27; BABIP was more volatile on an annual basis than the rates at which they gave up home runs or walks. It was this greater volatility that had led McCracken to conclude pitchers had &quot;little or no control&quot; over hits on balls in play. But Tippett also found large and significant differences between pitchers&#x27; career BABIP. In many cases, it was these differences that accounted for the pitchers&#x27; relative success.

However, improvements to DIP that look at more nuanced defense-independent stats than strikeouts, home runs, and walks (such as groundball rate), have been able to account for many of the BABIP differences that Tippet identified without reintroducing the noise from defense variability.

Despite other criticisms, the work by McCracken on DIP is regarded by many in the sabermetric community as the most important piece of baseball research in many years. As Jonah Keri wrote in 2012, &quot;When Voros McCracken wrote his seminal piece on pitching and defense 11 years ago, he helped change the way people—fans, writers, even general managers—think about run prevention in baseball. Where once we used to throw most of the blame for a hit on the pitcher who gave it up, McCracken helped us realize that a slew of other factors go into whether a ball hit into play falls for a hit. For many people in the game and others who simply watch it, our ability to recognize the influence of defense, park effects, and dumb luck can be traced back to that one little article&quot;.

DIP ERA was added to ESPN.com&#x27;s Sortable Stats in 2004.

<text>Ossington is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at Ossington Avenue just north of Bloor Street West and opened in 1966 as part of the original segment of the subway line.

==Description==

The main station entrance is on the west side of Ossington Avenue, just north of Bloor. In December 2016, elevators were installed at this station, thus making Ossington station a fully accessible station. There is a second automatic entrance, with entry only by Presto card, on Delaware Avenue, beside a TTC electrical substation.

As part of the 2016 renovation, the station acquired the artwork &quot;Ossington Particles&quot; by Scott Eunson. The artwork uses 800 stick-on coloured acrylic tiles arranged in clusters near stairways on the platform and mezzanine levels. Plaques in the station provide an artist&#x27;s message: &quot;The Particles inhabit the tile grid of Ossington Station to tell a story of the natural and human history of this site, mapping the local Garrison Creek watershed and recalling the ancient landscape and geology of this neighborhood.&quot;
==Surface connections==

TTC routes serving the station include:
== Easier access program ==
In the summer of 2014, work has begun on the station to make it accessible to all customers. Improvements to the station include two new elevators to access the subway platforms, automatic sliding doors, barrier free access to the platform, security upgrades, and signage improvements.

<text>Christie is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the east side of Christie Street just north of Bloor Street West, and opened in 1966 as part of the original segment of the subway line.

==History==
Christie station opened in 1966, as part of the first phase of the Bloor–Danforth line.

The station was damaged in 1976 when a fire was set on board a late-evening train. Nobody was hurt, but four cars of the train were destroyed and part of the station&#x27;s platform area, including the tiled wall, suffered severe damage. During the repair parts of the trim were replaced with a different colour; red-brown instead of the original green tile.

Christie Street is named after Christy McDougall, wife of Peter McDougall, a landowner in the area. Historical documents indicate that the street was given her name by as early as 1835.


==Station access upgrades==
Construction to make the station&#x27;s main entrance wheelchair accessible by adding two elevators had begun by the fourth quarter of 2021. One elevator will link the street level, the concourse level, and the westbound platform; the other elevator will link the concourse level and the eastbound platform. Construction is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2025.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include Korea Town and Christie Pits.

<text>Bathurst is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station, which opened in 1966, is located on Bathurst Street just north of Bloor Street West. It is a major transfer point for both bus and streetcar routes, including the 511 Bathurst route, which provides services to Exhibition Place.

Wi-Fi service is available at this station. The main entrance at Bathurst and Bloor, where the collectors and faregates are located, is in the station building at the surface, which puts the station&#x27;s streetcar and bus platforms within the fare paid zone. The opening of elevators in January 2000 made the station fully accessible. The elevators provide access between the eastbound platform and concourse, and between the westbound platform and street level via the concourse. There is regular stairway and escalator connections between all levels. There is also a secondary unstaffed entrance on Markham street just north of Bloor street, which leads directly to the subway platform.

On August 4, 2020, the Photo ID Centre at Sherbourne station was permanently closed and relocated to Bathurst station on the concourse level.

==Destinations==

==Tributes to Honest Ed&#x27;s==
In November 2016, the Honest Ed&#x27;s style signs and slogans were decorated in this station to commemorate the impact of Honest Ed&#x27;s landmark discount store on the community. This temporary tribute remained on display until just after Honest Ed&#x27;s closing on December 31, 2016. Temporary signs hand-painted in the familiar Honest Ed&#x27;s style welcomed customers at street level, and the windows were decorated with the TTC&#x27;s unique take on Ed&#x27;s famous punny signs. In addition to this unique tribute, the TTC&#x27;s November 2016 Metropass featured Honest Ed&#x27;s famous sign.

The TTC later installed a permanent tribute to Honest Ed&#x27;s on the concourse level in a passage leading to the streetcar/bus platforms. This tribute consists of five vertical panels and a mural. The panels show photos, store signs and other memorabilia associated with the former department store. The mural, on the wall opposite to the panels, is a realistic, life-size image of the vault door that was on the north side of Honest Ed&#x27;s. The trompe-l&#x27;œil image makes the door&#x27;s hardware look 3-dimensional. There are two smaller images of the vault door on one of the five panels.

==Parkette==

The piece of land between the main station building and Bathurst Street, encircled by the streetcar loop tracks, is used by the City of Toronto as a public park. Previously named &quot;Bathurst Subway Parkette&quot;, a ceremony took place on September 22, 2008 to rename the park &quot;Ed &amp; Anne Mirvish Parkette&quot;. Ed Mirvish had been a well known local businessman whose landmark Honest Ed&#x27;s discount store was located nearby at the southwest corner of Bloor Street and Bathurst Street. The Mirvish family had requested an appropriate commemoration to Ed, who had died on July 11, 2007 and the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division recommended the renaming of this parkette as an opportunity to honour Ed and his wife Anne, who were both a positive influence on the community.

<doc id="1305801" wikidata="Q7127595" url="?curid=1305801" title="Palisades Center">
<text>Palisades Center is a shopping mall in West Nyack, New York, which as of December 2022, was the twelfth-largest in the United States by gross leasable space. It has also been one of the nation&#x27;s most lucrative malls, producing $40 million in annual sales tax and $17 million in property taxes in its first ten years of operation.

Built in the industrial style, the mall was developed by Pyramid Management Group, and opened in March 1998. It was named after the nearby Palisades, which border the Hudson River and the eastern part of Rockland County. It is bounded on three sides by major state routes: the New York State Thruway (Interstates 87 and 287) to the north (Exit 12), NY Route 303 to the east, and NY Route 59 to the south. It is also located near the Thruway&#x27;s intersection of the Palisades Interstate Parkway, and is only a few miles west of the Tappan Zee Bridge, which provides access from points east of the Hudson River.

==History==
===1990s===
According to the mall&#x27;s sponsoring partner, Thomas Valenti, it took 16 years to get the mall approved and built. The 130-acre site was purchased by The Pyramid Companies for about $3 million and a promise to clean up the two landfills, which held incinerator ash and garbage. The mall was proposed in 1985 with a goal of luring upscale retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord &amp; Taylor, and also a promise to keep sales tax dollars from slipping across state lines into New Jersey. The site was selected for its proximity to the New York State Thruway and Westchester County. Its location four miles from New Jersey, where blue laws in Paramus keep the malls closed on Sundays, was also a factor. Local residents, recalling how the Nanuet Mall nearly drew the life out of Rockland County&#x27;s traditional shopping villages about 20 years earlier, opposed the mall, predicting that it would bring crime, increased traffic, air pollution, and an economic downturn to the area&#x27;s downtowns, and that the site was not properly tested for toxins. In October 1993, ground was broken on the mall, whose construction would cost between $250 million and $280 million.
The Palisades Center was built around the Mount Moor Cemetery, a cemetery established in 1849 for people of color, including Native American and African American veterans of American wars from the Civil War to the Korean War. The cemetery is visible from a number of points in the mall, and was undisturbed by construction.

The Historical Society of Rockland County placed a historical sign which reads:

The construction of the mall faced a number of environmental obstacles before it began. What was initially thought to be a mastodon buried there turned out to be a circus elephant. Nesting grounds for a nearly extinct red-legged partridge turned out to be a domesticated pheasant. Other problems included flooding from one of the region&#x27;s glacier-dug bottom spots and runoff from three landfills on the property.

The mall was completed in December 1997 and opened on March 4, 1998. Initially the mall had four anchor stores. The number fluctuated over the years as new anchors opened and closed, peaking at 16 in the 2010s. A few of the stores that were present in the mall in its first year were the WNET Store of Knowledge, the Nickelodeon Store, and Record Town.

From its inception, rumors circulated that the mall&#x27;s underground parking lot was sinking because it was built on unstable swampland, and that it would collapse under its own weight.

=== 2000s===
Rumors that the mall would close abounded after the 1999-2000 holiday season. On the January 6, 2000, episode of &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, host Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, who lives in Nyack, mentioned the rumor of the building&#x27;s sinking to her audience. Local police, town engineering officials and the mall&#x27;s developers assured the public that these stories were false and that the mall was safe and in no danger of closing. A managing partner of the mall, Thomas J. Valenti, appeared on a later episode of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s show, performing a song-and-dance number to the tune of &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; to debunk the rumors of the mall sinking.

On November 5, 2002, voters in Clarkstown voted on a referendum in which the mall requested approval for it to lease of theretofore unoccupied space, in keeping with a 1997 covenant in which Pyramid Companies agreed any additional leasing would be decided by a town referendum as part of a deal that let the mall take over three town streets. Opponents argued that Pyramid Companies had previously stated that this space had no practical use when they had built beyond the original they were allowed, but Pyramid insisted that they did not wish to expand beyond the limits of the mall, but rather to lease space already in the building, which would be occupied by Kids City, an educational and recreational center for children ages 3 to 12. Nicole Doliner, president of the Rockland Civic Association, characterized Kids City as a theme park. Voters rejected the measure by a 2-1 margin.

In 2008, opponents of the mall complained that the Superfund site located on the property was paved over rather than cleaned, and that the mall tax receipts failed to lower the average homeowner&#x27;s bill as advertised. In the 2008 documentary &quot;Megamall&quot; mall opponent Bruce Broadley said, &quot;Everything we said would happen happened. Go back and look at all the proposals and drawings. It&#x27;s a vastly different mall that was built. It was sold as upscale. What they built is arguably one of the ugliest malls in America.&quot; However, Clarkstown Town Board member Shirley Lasker, who opposed the mall, said in 2008 that the board&#x27;s concerns over traffic did not materialize. Valenti said that the $23-million effort to fix area roads and create a special exit for the mall on the Thruway prevented the predicted traffic congestion. Columnist Greg Clary argued that aesthetics are subjective, that average homeowners&#x27; bills did not go down due to continued spending by elected officials, and that while the downtowns were hurt by the mall, this is not unique to the area, and can be averted by town planners who represent some of the mall&#x27;s 20 million patrons. &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Joe Queenan criticized the mall&#x27;s Brutalist exterior as lacking design and theme and characterized its rectangular layout as &quot;a series of interlocking coffins.&quot; He also criticized the &quot;trash gondolas&quot; visible near the Interstate 287 entrance. Queenan had kinder things to say about the mall&#x27;s vast interior, likening its sprawling floors to a retail version of Centre Georges Pompidou, analogizing its amalgamated structure to the &quot;Gotham skyline,&quot; and lauding the bowling alley, ice rink, and food court Ferris wheel for giving people an opportunity to play &quot;adult hooky.&quot;

In 2009, the mall replaced its historic 19th-century carousel from Venice, Italy, with a modern doubler-decker model.

===2010s===
On May 3, 2013, Pyramid officials announced that Palisades Center would undergo a multimillion-dollar remodeling from May to December that year in order to give a more upscale appearance to the mall, which had begun to show signs of wear and tear. The renovation brought a warmer color scheme to soften the institutional beige of the mall, colored glass mosaics, ceiling facets, and designer lighting. The four-story court at the center of the mall received glass handrails and architectural lighting elements, and the &quot;ThEATery&quot; area on Level 4 got new tile floors and chandelier fixtures. Other areas received soft seating, custom planters, and plush carpets.

In 2016 Pyramid Companies received a $388.5 million mortgage on the property. The following year, the mall was at full occupancy.

The late 2010s saw several traditional chain anchors update their brick-and-mortar fleets, due to competition by digital retailers in recent years.

On March 17, 2017, JCPenney announced that their Palisade Center location would be one of 138 of its stores to close as part of its modernization of its brick-and-mortar operations.

In September 2019, it was reported that the Lord &amp; Taylor store at Palisades Center would be closing, with Clarkstown Councilman Donald Franchino explaining that the mall needed to diversify in its pursuit of moving toward a greater a mixture of retail and entertainment.

===2020-present===

The mall temporarily closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and suffered financially as a result of that crisis. By July 2020, Pyramid Companies missed mortgage payments since the prior April, and had risked defaulting on its $388.5 million CMBS loan, but reached an agreement with its lenders to avoid foreclosure.

In October 2020, Clarkstown held a referendum in which citizens were asked to vote on whether to lift the agreement made between the town and the mall&#x27;s developer in 1998 preventing the mall from renting out of unused space in its fourth-floor attic, whose high-ceilings the mall believed would be more appealing to a wide array of possible tenants than adapting former anchor store space. That expansion was approved November 4, 2020.

That December, the data firm Trepp appraised Palisades Center at $425 million, which was less than half of the $881 million at which the mall was valued in 2016, when Pyramid Companies received a $388.5 million mortgage on the property.

In March 2021, the &quot;Rockland County Business Journal&quot; reported that the mall, which was in a state of transition exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, would likely not replace the former Lord &amp; Taylor and JC Penney with other department stores or retail. Stephen J. Congel, CEO of Pyramid Management Group, which manages the Palisades Center, pointed to the company&#x27;s portfolio-wide diversification strategy, in which it incorporated new uses, such as residential developments, to its existing assets, though Congel did not comment when asked if residential projects were planned for Palisades Center.

In early January 2022, Picanha Brazilian Steakhouse opened a location at the mall, which following the success of their first two locations in Philadelphia, marked the beginning of that chain&#x27;s expansion across the United States.

On February 10, 2023, Wilmington Trust, the trustee on the $418.5 million mortgage issued in April 2016, filed a commercial mortgage foreclosure complaint in New York State Supreme Court. The complaint came after mall&#x27;s owners missed payments on both a deal that extended the maturity date of the mortgage to October 9, 2022 and a forbearance agreement extending the payment date to November 9, 2022.

==Layout and attractions==
The mall has four floors, which at its opening housed over 220 businesses under a roof, as well as 8,500 parking spaces on the property&#x27;s , a space large enough to fit 40 White Houses. To accommodate its customers and tenants, the mall houses 40 escalators, eight passenger elevators, and 11 freight elevators.
The third floor of the mall contains a 2,000-seat food court with over a dozen quick-service restaurants, and a Ferris wheel. That level formerly housed Philadelphia Toboggan Company Carousel Number 15, a carousel built in 1907, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. In May 2009, mall management announced that the then-101-year-old carousel would be disassembled and removed the following month. It was replaced by a modern, double-decker Venetian carousel. In October 2021, &quot;The Journal News&quot; reported that ClimbZone would replace the Venetian Carousel.

On the fourth floor is a stadium-seating 21-screen AMC Theatres, that previously held a separate IMAX theater. Since 2016, the former IMAX site is home to 5 Wits Interactive Family Entertainment Center.

At the east end of the fourth floor is an ice rink, which is home to teams and programs that include the Palisades Predators Youth Hockey team and BUDS for Hockey. The rink also houses a free skate and Learn to Skate program, an arcade (which at one point had &quot;Sonic Championship&quot;), and a party room for birthday parties. The fourth floor is also the entry to Palisades Climb Adventure, a five-level, climbing obstacle course created by WonderWorks that allows guests to climb on obstacles while strapped into a harness.

==In popular culture==
The mall was featured in multiple episodes of the TruTV series &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;.

The mall is used for exterior shots in the 2018 film &quot;Eighth Grade&quot;.

The mall can be seen as a backdrop in the 2019 film &quot;Hustlers&quot;.

<doc id="1305804" wikidata="Q812059" url="?curid=1305804" title="Bay station">
<text>Bay is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the heart of the Yorkville district just north of Bloor Street West on the west side of Bay Street.

The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) operates its lost articles office at this station, where forgotten objects on the city&#x27;s buses and trains are held until reclaimed or sold by auction. Wi-Fi service is available at this station.

==History==
Bay station opened in 1966 as part of the original segment of the Bloor–Danforth line, from in the west to in the east. Early plans of the line, and even some published maps, named this station &quot;Yorkville&quot;; the platform signs read &quot;BAY&quot; in large type, with a smaller &quot;YORKVILLE&quot; caption underneath. Work commenced in August 2019 to make Bay station wheelchair accessible; this work was completed on December 30, 2020.

===Lower Bay===

Below the main platform for Bay station is an abandoned platform, which was used for only six months in 1966 when the TTC experimentally ran trains whose routes included portions of both the Yonge–University and Bloor–Danforth lines. This abandoned platform is sometimes referred to as &quot;Lower Bay&quot; by the general public or &quot;Bay Lower&quot; by the TTC.

The platform was in service from February to September 1966 as part of an interlining experiment, in which the TTC ran trains along three routes, with one matching the subsequent Bloor–Danforth line, and the other two combining parts of the Bloor–Danforth line with the Yonge–University line. The experiment was deemed a failure, largely because delays anywhere quickly cascaded to affect the entire system. Also, as the stations had not been laid out effectively for cross-platform interchange, trains travelling east from and west from Yonge alternated between the two levels, leading passengers to wait on the stairs in-between the levels, since they were unable to tell which platform would receive the next train.

With every station served by at least two routes (Bloor–Yonge station was served by all three routes, with the Yonge–University–Danforth route passing through it twice, once on each level), passengers could travel between any two stations without changing trains; though for some station combinations, such as travel between a station north of Bloor and one on the Bloor–Danforth route, transferring at Bloor–Yonge station resulted in a more direct path. The TTC found that when the extra time waiting for a train from the correct route was considered, the time savings were not significant.
Much of the infrastructure for interlining is still present on the system, and most older stations still have signs informing passengers of each train&#x27;s next destination, although they no longer change. While St. George and Bloor–Yonge stations remained operating upper and lower platforms for the two crossing subway lines, Bay station would be served by only the Bloor–Danforth line.

Lower Bay and the tracks leading to it still exist and are now used to train new operators, to move trains between the two current lines, for platform-surface experiments, and to allow filming in the subway without disrupting public service. The station has been modified several times to make it look like a &quot;common&quot; North American subway station, and the TTC once had an elaborate pre-built set for converting it to a New York subway station. The set was used for the filming of the movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot;. The TTC asked the production company if they could donate the set. The set remained up for about three weeks as a selling point for other movies but was then torn down due to safety concerns. Other notable movies shot at Lower Bay include &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot;, &quot;Mimic&quot;, &quot;End of the Line&quot;, &quot;The Recruit&quot;, and most recently, in 2017, in the film &quot;The Sound&quot;, in which the Lower Bay station was the main focus and setting of the story. 

The station was also used as a film set in the music video &quot;Never Again&quot;, performed by the band the Midway State, as well as the 2015 music video for the song &quot;Kill V. Maim&quot; from Canadian singer and songwriter Grimes&#x27;s 4th studio album &quot;Art Angels&quot;. This music video was directed by Grimes and her brother, Mac Boucher. The short film, &quot;The Last Stop&quot;, directed by Tyler Cowan, also featured the Lower Bay station as its primary location. The band Great Lake Swimmers also recorded &quot;The Great Exhale&quot;, a song from their 2012 album &quot;New Wild Everywhere&quot;, in Lower Bay station. In 2018, the band Fucked Up headlined Canadian Music Week with a showcase show in Lower Bay station. It has also been used as training exercise location by the local army reserve.

====Proposed re-activation of Lower Bay====
In 2014, Josef Kates, an engineer, proposed reactivating Lower Bay during rush hour by having northbound University trains bypass subway station and instead short turn at Bay. Kates argues this would relieve both St. George and stations by allowing some downtown-bound passengers transferring from the Bloor–Danforth line to transfer at Bay instead of Yonge or St. George.

====Public access====

The station itself is not open to public access. During structural repairs to the tunnel roof between Bay and St. George stations, trains were bypassed to Museum station via the interlining tracks on Saturdays and Sundays from February 24 to March 11, 2007. As a result, riders could see Lower Bay through the train windows as they rode between Bloor–Yonge and Museum stations. During the May 2010 Victoria Day long weekend, the station was again used to facilitate track repairs, and once again the public got a rare opportunity to ride through the station.

The TTC announced on May 9, 2011, that due to track switch replacement on the Bloor–Danforth line between St. George and Bloor–Yonge stations, a similar subway diversion procedure would be implemented, with all eastbound and westbound trains on the Bloor–Danforth turning back at Museum station during the weekend of May 14–15, 2011 giving passengers another glimpse of Lower Bay subway station. Passengers exited the train at Museum station, crossed the centre platform, and boarded the northbound, eastbound, or westbound train to continue their subway trip. University–Spadina subway passengers travelling eastbound on the Bloor–Danforth line changed trains at Museum station. During the subway diversion, the lower level of St. George station was closed and all trains served the upper level. Upper Bay station was also closed. Regular Bloor–Danforth subway service resumed on May 16, 2011.

The TTC opened Lower Bay to the public for Doors Open Toronto on May 26, 2007. According to TTC chair Adam Giambrone&#x27;s introduction leaflet, this event in 2007 was the first time since 1966 that the station&#x27;s platform was open to the public. There were large line-ups, as a limited number of people were allowed on the platform at any one time. Two trains were parked on the tracks, a video screen displayed movies or commercials shot in Bay Lower, and movie posters were hung around the platform. Since 2007, the station has been open to the public periodically, often as part of subsequent Nuit Blanche and Doors Open Toronto events.

<text>Sherbourne is a subway station on the Bloor–Danforth line in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station, which opened in 1966, is located west of Sherbourne Street on the south side of Bloor Street East. The station primarily serves the St. James Town neighbourhood and the southern portion of Rosedale. In December 2021, this station became an accessible subway station after undergoing renovations that began in August 2019.

==Entrances==

The primary entrance is located on the Sherbourne Street side of the office building at 425 Bloor Street East. An unmanned second entrance to the east end of the platforms is on Glen Road, a small side street which runs north off Howard Street from the densely populated St. James Town. A pedestrian tunnel under Bloor Street and a footbridge across Rosedale Valley Road provide access to this entrance from Rosedale to the north.

==Photo ID Centre==
Sherbourne station previously housed the TTC Photo ID Centre. The TTC photographic team now visits most participating colleges and universities at the beginning of each academic year, and the post-secondary student monthly pass is now available only available via the Presto card and can be purchased from Presto fare vending machines located inside the station. In August 2020, the Photo ID Centre at Sherbourne station was permanently closed and relocated to Bathurst station.

==Artwork==

In 2019, the artwork titled &quot;The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts&quot; by Rebecca Bayer was installed as panels at various locations in the station at the platform and concourse levels. Using custom ceramic tiles, the panels consist of colourful mosaics arranged in geometric, triangular patterns. According to the TTC&#x27;s Public Art page: &quot;Sherbourne station is an important transit hub for the multicultural neighbourhoods it serves and this artwork intends to reaffirm the station as a shared place where the wider community interacts daily.&quot;

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
This is the only station that was located south of Bloor Street on the original 1966 line. Sherbourne is also uniquely deep underground, which required a section of the tunnel to be bored, rather than constructed using the shallow cut-and-cover method used for most of the line, west to Bloor–Yonge station.

East of the station, the line crosses back under Bloor Street to the north side. It emerges from the tunnel to cross the Rosedale Ravine on a curving covered concrete bridge, and then returns underground just before Castle Frank station. The adjacent bridge that carries Bloor Street across the ravine, although built with provision for a lower deck as part of the Prince Edward Viaduct project, is at such an angle to the subway alignment that it could not be conveniently used. A conventional bridge was planned for the subway line, with a view of the ravine, but local objections forced the Toronto Transit Commission to enclose it in a concrete shell for noise abatement.

<text>Castle Frank is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway. It is located at the northwest corner of Bloor Street East and Castle Frank Road.

Without any major commercial, industrial or entertainment destinations, the station primarily serves the residents of South Rosedale, from which it is within walking distance, and St. James Town and Cabbagetown by way of the 65 Parliament and 94 Wellesley bus routes. Nearby landmarks include Rosedale Heights School of the Arts and St. James Cemetery.

==Entrances==
The entrance to the station is located on the northwest corner of Castle Frank Road and Bloor Street East.
The station was rated as high priority in the requirement for a second exit which, although scheduled to be finished by January 2010, finally opened in December 2012 after many delays. This project still did not make the station accessible, although the stairs give subway riders a direct connection to the bus bays. Only an exit is provided through turnstile gates, without any way to get into the station using a pass or token that is available at the secondary entrance to many other stations.

Late in the fourth quarter of 2021, construction started to install two elevators to make Castle Frank station accessible, connecting the street-level concourse to each of the east- and westbound platforms. The project was completed in October 2024.

==History==
Castle Frank station, opened in 1966, is named after the community that it serves. Its streets, and the brook that flows through it, are in turn named after John Graves Simcoe&#x27;s summer residence in the area overlooking the Don River, which burned down in 1829. The residence was named after his son Francis Simcoe. In 1954, a historical marker was placed in Prince Edward Viaduct Parkette, near the site of the historic Castle Frank residence, on the south side of Bloor Street at Castle Frank Road.

The Parliament streetcar line operated to its northerly terminus at the Viaduct Loop until 1966. No consideration was given to construct the short connection, from that location at Bloor Street East and Parliament Street across the Rosedale Ravine, which would have made the streetcar route a major feeder line to the subway station. The site of the streetcar loop is now Rekai Family Parkette.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

East of the station, the line runs under Bloor Street to use the lower deck of the Prince Edward Viaduct. At the end of the Viaduct, it swings to parallel Danforth Avenue on the north side. Immediately west of the station, the line crosses the Rosedale Ravine in a covered concrete bridge, then continues in a tunnel to Sherbourne station.

<doc id="1305818" wikidata="Q922768" url="?curid=1305818" title="Broadview station">
<text>Broadview is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The entrance to the building is from Broadview Avenue just north of Danforth Avenue.

The station, which is the north-eastern terminus of the 504B King, 505 Dundas, and 508 Lake Shore streetcar routes, has two streetcar platforms and five bus bays to allow riders to transfer between connecting routes. Wi-Fi service is available at this station.

==History==
Broadview station was opened in 1966 as part of the original segment of the Bloor–Danforth line, from Keele station in the west to Woodbine station in the east. In that same year, the streetcar loop at Broadview station replaced the nearby Erindale Loop formerly located at the corner of Erindale and Broadview avenues.

In 2003, a renovation of the station began, adding an extra streetcar track, additional bus bays, new signage, and elevators/stairways to the platforms, satisfying fire safety requirements for a second exit. The elevators entered service in 2006, and the stairs from the westbound subway to the bus and streetcar platform followed. The next stage of the renovation was to build a stairway from the bus and streetcar platform to the eastbound subway platform. This was completed and opened in 2008; however, it was closed shortly afterwards due to water ingress. It has since been re-opened.

In early 2020, the 504 King streetcar platform was extended to accommodate two Flexity Outlook streetcars in order to relieve the queuing of streetcars waiting on the street to enter the station.

From May 7, 2023, to February 18, 2024, streetcar service was suspended for track and utility work along Broadview Avenue north of Gerrard Street, as well as track replacement for the station&#x27;s streetcar loop. The bus loop had a shorter closure period. When streetcar service resumed, platform assignments were changed with the 505 using the longer track (holding two streetcars) and the 504B streetcar using the shorter track.

Effective June 24, 2024, Broadview station became the eastern terminal of the 508 Lake Shore route. The rush-hour service uses the same platform as 504 Dundas.
==Nearby landmarks==
The station, located at the east end of the Prince Edward Viaduct, serves the local communities of Playter Estates, Greektown and Riverdale and nearby destinations such as Danforth Music Hall and Riverdale Park.

==Parkette==

The northwest corner of the station property, which was not required for transit purposes, was leased to the former City of Toronto&#x27;s Parks Department, since the early 1970s, for use as a public park. During the upgrading of the station facilities in the 2000s, part of the parkette land was required to expand the streetcar platforms and the remainder was used as a staging area during the construction. Subsequently, in 2010 the TTC declared this portion of the site surplus to its operating requirements and the City of Toronto, Parks, Forestry and Recreation agreed to maintain the re-landscaped land for use as a parkette.

==Surface connections==
When the subway is closed, an on-street transfer is required at the parkette. TTC routes serving the station include:

<doc id="1305819" wikidata="Q1022352" url="?curid=1305819" title="C.H.U.D.">
<text>C.H.U.D. is a 1984 American science fiction horror film directed by Douglas Cheek, produced by Andrew Bonime, and starring John Heard, Daniel Stern, and Christopher Curry in his film debut. The plot concerns a New York City police officer and a homeless shelter manager who team up to investigate a series of disappearances, and discover that the missing people have been killed by humanoid monsters that live in the sewers.

The title of the movie is an abbreviation for &quot;cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers&quot;.

&quot;C.H.U.D.&quot; was released in North America on August 31, 1984, and grossed $4.7 million. It was followed in 1989 by a sequel titled &quot;C.H.U.D. II: Bud the C.H.U.D.&quot;.

==Plot==
A woman, Flora Bosch, is walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a manhole, a creature attacks Mrs. Bosch and drags her and the dog into the sewers.

George Cooper, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone fame and fortune and is living with his girlfriend Lauren. His current project is photographing New York City&#x27;s homeless population, specifically those known as &quot;undergrounders&quot;, or people who reside in the city&#x27;s sewers and subway tunnels.

NYPD Captain Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons being reported to his precinct, as Flora — his wife — is also missing. Bosch interviews A.J. &quot;The Reverend&quot; Shepherd, who runs the local homeless shelter. A.J. believes that the recent events are part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch&#x27;s superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from Wilson, who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

It turns out that monsters are lurking beneath the streets: beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved and eaten, and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and a mutant that comes up through the sewer access point that she opened in the basement of her apartment building.

A.J. and George meet up and discover that the NRC is directly involved in the slaughter that has been going on. Although the political bureaucracy has forbidden the NRC to transport the toxic wastes through New York because of the large-scale danger to the public, it has secretly been hiding the waste by-products, marked as &quot;Contamination Hazard Urban Disposal&quot;, beneath Manhattan in the abandoned subway tunnels. The underground homeless population has been coming into contact with these by-products, turning them into the mutated creatures. To protect this secret, Wilson plans to seal the sewers, open up some gas lines and asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s and any witnesses of their existence, despite the inherent danger to the city. In the meantime, Lauren is attacked by the mutants in her apartment and narrowly escapes them.

Later that evening at a diner, two police officers and the waitress are killed and carried off by the mutants, finally drawing the public&#x27;s attention to the disappearances. George and A.J. recover a camera set left behind by an NRC crew slain by the mutants during a previous clean-up attempt and use it to report their findings to Bosch. Confronted by Bosch, Wilson runs off, and later shoots Bosch while the latter helps A.J. and George escape from a manhole. Wilson then tries to run George and A.J. over with a truck, but A.J. fatally shoots Wilson with Bosch&#x27;s gun, and the truck explodes as it drives into the manhole.

==Reception==

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports a 29% approval rating based on 14 reviews; the average rating is 3.89/10. Lawrence Van Gelder from &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated in his review for the film, &quot;&quot;C.H.U.D.&quot; makes no pretension toward serious thesis about government or the environment. It is meant to be light commercial entertainment, and in the category of horror films it stands as a praiseworthy effort&quot;. Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;Perfect for bleary-eyed late-night viewing and pretty much unwatchable at any other hour.&quot; Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict called it a fun film that focuses more on entertainment than deeper issues. Joshua Rothkopf of &quot;Time Out New York&quot; included it in &quot;Time Out&quot;″s list of best New York-set films, calling it &quot;more funny than scary&quot;. Bloody Disgusting rated it 4.5/5 stars and called it &quot;definitely one of b-movies best kept secrets&quot;.

It won Best Fantasy Film at Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film in 1985.

== Legacy ==

A sequel, &quot;C.H.U.D. II: Bud the C.H.U.D.&quot;, was released in 1989. Although &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot; was negatively received during its initial release, it attracted a cult following over the years, inspired the name of a film website (which changed the acronym&#x27;s meaning to Cinematic Happenings Under Development) and a political epithet, and references to it have appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, The CW&#x27;s &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Clerks II&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;Archer&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Pushing Daisies,&quot; &quot;Outer Banks&quot;, &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;. Martin Cooper&#x27;s score was later named number 33 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 35 Greatest Horror Soundtracks. The film was also the subject of an April Fool&#x27;s hoax announcement by The Criterion Collection. In 2007, Rob Zombie was rumored to be considering a remake, and, in 2008, a different remake was rumored to be in production. C.H.U.D. appears in the 2003 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; under the name T.H.U.D. A VHS copy of &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot; appears in the opening shot of Jordan Peele&#x27;s 2019 horror film &quot;Us&quot;.

The found footage horror film &quot;Dwellers&quot; has been publicly referenced by its writer and director Drew Fortier as being heavily influenced by C.H.U.D.

The anthology &quot;C.H.U.D. LIVES!: A Tribute Anthology&quot;, edited by Joe Mynhardt, was released in 2018 and featured an introduction by David Drake, an interview with the late C.H.U.D. movie producer Andrew Bonime, an interview horror author Eric S. Brown did with C.H.U.D. screenwriter Parnell Hall and nineteen stories set in the universe of the movie C.H.U.D. Contributors included Robert E. Waters, Nick Cato, Ryan C. Thomas, David Robbins, Christopher Fulbright, Angeline Hawkes, Greg Mitchell, Alex Laybourne, Michael H. Hanson, Ben Fisher, Tim Waggoner, Jason White, Mort Castle, David Bernstein, Martin Powell, Chad Lutzke, J.G. Faherty, Phillip C. Perron, Ross Baxter, Jonathan Maberry, and Eugene Johnson.

The upcoming film &quot;Bunker Heights&quot; has been regarded by Dread Central as being a spiritual successor to C.H.U.D.

In late 2019, the term &quot;chud&quot; in reference to the film started to see usage in internet culture to derogatorily refer to individuals involved in far-right politics. Years later, a variant of the wojak meme modelled after Patrick Crusius titled &quot;Chudjak&quot; emerged. Like the contemporary usage of the word chud, the Chudjak meme has been used to satirise and mock users of /pol/ for their far-right politics.

<text>Chester is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station is located on Chester Avenue just north of Danforth Avenue. It opened in 1966 as one of the original stations of this subway line.

==Facilities==
Following the design style set by the stations of the Bloor–Danforth line, Chester station uses a two-colour theme with the station&#x27;s name in the Toronto Subway font. In keeping with the style, Chester&#x27;s blue trim tiles and light green main tiles complement the original tile colours of Lansdowne and Dufferin, respectively. The station has side platforms with 2 tracks serving the station, each with an elevator between platform level and street level at the existing entrance. Chester station has two entrances, both located on Chester Avenue just north of Danforth Avenue but on opposite sides of the street. A walkway leads to the station from a nearby street to allow access to the station from the west side. The Toronto Parking Authority operates a public parking lot across Chester Avenue opposite the subway entrance.

By 2021, the TTC had installed the artwork titled &quot;FLORAE&quot; by artist Katharine Harvey. The artwork is inspired by native plants and flowers of the area and consists of a series of wall mosaics and art glass elements. These were installed over the front entrance and by each of the two elevators. The station art is part of the TTC Public Art Program announced in June 2017.

==Communities served==
The nearby communities that are served by this station include Greektown, Withrow Park, Riverdale, and Broadview North. In addition to serving these communities, Chester station is commonly used to access local street festivals such as the Taste of the Danforth.

==History==
Chester station was opened on February 26, 1966, along with the rest of the first phase of the Bloor–Danforth line which operated initially between and stations.

The Gateway Newsstand kiosk at the station, which had been vacant for over six years, was reopened on May 8, 2015, as &quot;the Artist Newsstand&quot; by a group of local artists led by Jess Dobkin. Along with the usual offerings of newspapers, magazines and drinks, the Artist Newsstand is a performance and gallery space for artists and was staffed by artists as a way of funding their work. A $4,000 Kickstarter campaign was launched to fund the renovation of the kiosk, with the campaign successfully raising $4,931. The Artist Newsstand operated in the space for one year.

Although the station&#x27;s need for a second exit was rated as a high priority in 2004, Chester was the last station left on the east end of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth where design work and consultation on the addition of a second exit had not started. In May 2014, a list of 15 potential second-exit sites was developed. In June 2016, the location of the second exit was announced, situated at the west side of the parking lot across the street from the main entrance. The construction of two elevators and the second exit started in 2018, and the elevators opened on September 2, 2020; the second exit opened on April 23, 2021. As part of the accessibility upgrades, the station was closed for two weeks in June 2020.

== Surface connections ==

Chester station is not served by TTC buses during the day. When the subway is not in operation, the station is served by the 300 Bloor–Danforth night bus.

<doc id="1305822" wikidata="Q284053" url="?curid=1305822" title="Dado (architecture)">
<text>In architecture, the dado is the lower part of a wall, below the dado rail and above the skirting board. The word is borrowed from Italian meaning &quot;dice&quot; or &quot;cube&quot;, and refers to &quot;&quot;, an architectural term for the middle section of a pedestal or plinth.

==Decorative treatment==
This area is given a decorative treatment different from that for the upper part of the wall; for example panelling, wainscoting or lincrusta. The purpose of the dado treatment to a wall is both aesthetic and functional. Historically, the panelling below the dado rail was installed to cover the lower part of the wall which was subject to stains associated with rising damp; additionally it provided protection from furniture and passing traffic. The dado rail itself is sometimes referred to as a chair rail, though this can be misleading since its function is principally aesthetic and not to protect the wall from chair backs.

==Derivation==
The name was first used in English as an architectural term for the part of a pedestal between the base and the cornice. As with many other architectural terms, the word is Italian in origin. The dado in a pedestal is roughly cubical in shape, and the word in Italian means &quot;dice&quot; or &quot;cube&quot; (ultimately Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;something given&quot;, hence also a die for casting lots). By extension, the dado becomes the lower part of a wall when the pedestal is treated as being continuous along the wall, with the cornice becoming the dado rail.

Pape was the first station scheduled to be renovated under a new modernization program, which will update the visual, safety and infrastructure aspects of many older stations. The renovations include adding a second entrance to the platform level, installation of elevators and public art, platform wall renovations, upgraded lights, and improved ventilation and fire safety systems.

The project was scheduled to begin in 2008, but due to delays, the contractor did not mobilize on the site until September 28, 2009.

Construction lasted until 2013. In the spring of that year it was estimated that the renovations would be complete by December. In April, the TTC announced an opinion survey which gave riders three options, continue with the current schedule, speed up renovations by three months by closing the station over six consecutive weekends, or speed up renovations by closing the station for 12 consecutive days. The results were that out of 2,842 respondents, most preferred the third option. The TTC announced that the closure would happen between August 19–30. The closure was originally scheduled for June 15–26, but a strike by the Terrazzo, Tile and Marble Guild of Ontario made it necessary to postpone the closure until the labour dispute was resolved.

The elevators came into operation on October 31, 2013 making the station fully accessible, and on December 23, 2013, the new second exit building opened.

==Future==
The Toronto Transit Commission has long had plans to construct a Relief Line, connecting the south loop of Line 1 Yonge–University to the east wing of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. The preferred route of the subway line is from Pape station to . Future extensions west of Osgoode and north of Pape would establish Pape as one of the major transit hubs in the Toronto subway system.

Previously, former mayor David Miller proposed the Transit City plan, part of which outlined the Don Mills LRT line, running along Don Mills Road from station to Pape station. Along with much of the proposals under that plan, the Don Mills LRT was scrapped by succeeding mayor Rob Ford.

In September 2019, the Government of Ontario announced plans for the Ontario Line, a successor to the Relief Line. The line is planned to intersect with the station. A tentative completion date has been set for 2027. As of July 2020, construction timing and impacts to Pape station have not yet been announced.

The Ontario Line is a planned rapid transit line that will connect Science Centre station (on Line 5 Eglinton) to Exhibition GO station (on the Lakeshore West GO line). A connection to Line 2 is planned at Pape station. The new platform and tracks will be constructed underneath and perpendicular to the existing Line 2 platforms, slightly to the east of Pape Avenue, to avoid traffic and utility disruptions during construction. As of December 2020, the expected completion date of the Ontario Line is 2030.

<text>Donlands is a station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway. The station is located in Toronto&#x27;s Greektown neighbourhood, at the southwest corner of Donlands Avenue and Strathmore Boulevard, just north of Danforth Avenue.

==History==
Donlands opened in 1966 as part of the original segment of the Bloor–Danforth line, between Keele station in the west and Woodbine station in the east. Originally only a small structure covered the stairs and escalator. The current building was constructed in the early 1980s and the fare-collection area was relocated from the concourse up to street level, which also brought the bus bays within the fare-paid zone.

On 6 August 1997, a pile of rubber pads being stored in the wye between Donlands station and Greenwood Yard caught fire. It was the TTC&#x27;s first major subway incident after the 1995 Russell Hill subway accident. The fire shut down the Bloor–Danforth line from Broadview eastward; two thousand passengers had to be evacuated from a pair of trains and nearly 50 were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation. Over 200 emergency personnel responded to the fire.
==Subway infrastructure==
Between Donlands and stations is a full grade-separated, double-track, underground wye junction, allowing trains from either direction to access the TTC&#x27;s Greenwood Yard, which is on the surface south of Danforth Avenue.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include the Madinah Masjid, the Toronto District School Board&#x27;s Kapapamahchakwew - Wandering Spirit School (formerly First Nations School of Toronto/Eastern Commerce Collegiate Institute), Subway Academy I, and Wilkinson Junior Public School. The station is located near the eastern limits of Toronto&#x27;s Greektown neighbourhood, which is also served by Pape, Chester and Broadview stations to the west.

==Second exit==
In June 2010, the TTC announced plans to add second exits to two subway stations on the Bloor–Danforth line. These exits were recommended after a fire safety audit due to the stations only having one primary means of emergency access.

The planned construction would have seen a new exit-only structure built at surface level on Dewhurst Boulevard. In order to build the exit, the TTC planned to expropriate residential land and demolish a home in the area. This decision proved to be controversial in the neighbourhoods affected and after some public outcry, the TTC stated that they would review their plans.

The TTC accepted the City Ombudsman&#x27;s report that these projects were not handled well by staff on two counts: community outreach, consultation and explanations about the technical and engineering decisions made by staff; and how the TTC communicated with residents whose properties were most affected.

Station improvements were deferred and a complete environmental assessment was to be done for the Downtown Relief Line first, and any potential implications for Donlands station were to be evaluated at that time. As of 2021, the successor to the Downtown Relief Line, the Ontario Line, is planned to interchange with Line 2 at Pape station instead of Donlands.

==Station access upgrades==

In early 2021, construction work on the second exit, access tunnels and elevators at Donlands station had begun. The second exit is located at 17/19 Dewhurst Boulevard; a residential building was demolished in late 2020 to make way for the second exit. Tunnels from the second exit building extended under Dewhurst and Strathmore Boulevards, connecting to the western end of the existing platforms. The surface–concourse–eastbound platform elevator is located within the existing station property on the southwest corner of Donlands Avenue and Strathmore Boulevard, while the concourse–westbound platform elevator is located underneath the playground of a daycare centre on the northwest corner of the same intersection. The project was completed in August 2024.
