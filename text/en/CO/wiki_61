<text>This article describes the history of Suffolk, the English county.

==Historical setting==

===Anglo-Saxon control===

The county of Suffolk (&quot;Sudfole&quot;, &quot;Suthfolc&quot;, meaning &#x27;southern folk&#x27;) was formed from the south part of the kingdom of East Anglia which had been settled by the Angles in the latter half of the 5th century. The most important Anglo-Saxon settlements appear to have been made at Sudbury and Ipswich. Before the end of the Norman dynasty, strongholds had arisen at Eye, Clare, Walton and Framlingham. Probably the establishment of Suffolk as a separate shire was scarcely completed before the Conquest, and although it was reckoned as distinct from Norfolk in the Domesday Survey of 1086, the fiscal administration of Norfolk and Suffolk remained under a single sheriff until 1575. The boundary of the county has undergone very little change, though its area has been considerably affected by coast erosion. Parts of Gorleston and Thetford, which formerly belonged to the ancient county of Suffolk, are now within the administrative county of Norfolk, and other slight alterations of the administrative boundary have been made. Under the Local Government Act of 1888 Suffolk was divided into the two administrative counties of East and West Suffolk.

===Land division===

At first the whole shire lay within the diocese of Dunwich which was founded approximately 631. In 673 a new bishopric was established at Elmham to comprise the whole of Norfolk which had formerly been included in the see of Dunwich. The latter came to an end with the incursion of the Danes, and on the revival of Christianity in this district Suffolk was included in the diocese of Elmham, subsequently removed from South Elmham to Thetford and thence to Norwich. The archdeaconry of Sudbury was transferred by the ecclesiastical commissioners to the diocese of Ely. This archdeaconry had been separated from the original archdeaconry of Suffolk in 1127. In 1256 the latter included thirteen deaneries which have since been subdivided, so that-at present it contains eighteen deaneries; Sudbury archdeaconry which comprised eight deaneries in 1256 included eleven in 1911. There were also three districts under jurisdiction of Canterbury and one under that of Rochester.

The shire court was held at Ipswich. In 1831 the whole county contained twenty-one hundreds and three municipal boroughs. Most of these hundreds were identical with those of the Domesday Survey, but in 1086 Babergh was rated as two hundreds, Cosford, Ipswich and Parham as half hundreds and Samford as a hundred and a half. Hoxne hundred was formerly known as Bishops hundred and the vills which were included later in Thredling hundred were within Claydon hundred in 1086. Two large ecclesiastical liberties extended over more than half of the county; that of St Edmund included the hundreds of Risbridge, Thedwastre, Thingoe, Cosford, Lackford and Blackbourn in which the kings writ did not run, and St Aethelreda of Ely claimed a similar privilege in the hundreds of Carleford, Colneis, Plumesgate, Loes, Wilford and Thredling. Among others who had large lands in the county with co-extensive jurisdiction were the lords of the honor of Clare, earls of Gloucester and Hereford and the lords of the honor of Eye, held successively by the Bigods, the Uffords and the De la Poles, earls of Suffolk. The Wingfields, Bacons and Herveys have been closely connected with the county.

For the purposes of civil government the Liberty of Saint Edmund and the remainder (or &quot;body&quot;) of the county were quite distinct, each providing a separate grand jury to the county assizes. The county was further divided into &quot;geldable&quot; land, in which fines and forfeitures were payable to the Crown, and the liberties and franchises where they were payable to the lord of the liberty. The geldable lands were divided into two quarter sessions divisions: Bungay (Hundreds of Blything, Mutford And Launditch and Wangford); and Ipswich (Bosmere and Claydon, Hartismere, Hoxne, Samford and Stow). The liberty of St Ethelredra held sessions at Woodbridge while those of the St Edmund were held at Bury St Edmunds. By the early nineteenth century these were being referred to simply as Beccles, Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich and Woodbridge Divisions. The three quarter sessions divisions of Beccles, Ipswich and Woodbridge were combined to form a single division in 1860. From that date Suffolk had eastern and western divisions with sessions held at Ipswich and Bury St Edmunds respectively. These became the basis for the two administrative counties of East Suffolk and West Suffolk in 1890.

===Danelaw through English Civil War===
Suffolk suffered severely from Danish incursions, and after the Treaty of Wedmore became a part of the Danelagh. In 1173 the Earl of Leicester landed at Walton with an army of Flemings and was joined by Hugh Bigod against Henry II. In 1317 and the succeeding years a great part of the county was in arms for Thomas of Lancaster. Queen Isabella and Mortimer having landed at Walton found all the district in their favour. In 1330 the county was raised to suppress the supporters of the Earl of Kent; and again in 1381 there was a serious rising of the peasantry chiefly in the neighbourhood of Bury St Edmunds. Although the county was for the most part Yorkist it took little part in the Wars of the Roses. In 1525 the artisans of the south strongly resisted Henry VIII&#x27;s forced loan. It was from Suffolk that Mary Tudor drew the army which supported her claim to the throne. In the Civil Wars the county was for the most part parliamentarian, and joined the Association of the Eastern Counties for defence against the Papists.

==Politics and economy==
The county was constantly represented in parliament by two knights from 1290, until the Reform Bill of 1832 gave four members to Suffolk, at the same time disfranchising the boroughs of Dunwich, Orford and Aldeburgh. Suffolk was early among the most populous of English counties, doubtless owing to its proximity to the continent. Fishing fleets have left its ports to bring back cod and ling from Iceland and herring and mackerel from the North Sea. From the 14th to the 17th century it was among the chief manufacturing counties of England owing to its cloth-weaving industry, which was at the height of its prosperity during the 15th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries its agricultural resources were utilized to provide the rapidly growing metropolis with food. In the following century various textile industries, such as the manufacture of sail-cloth, coconut fibre, horse-hair and clothing were established; silk-weavers migrated to Suffolk from Spitalfields, and early in the 19th century an important china factory flourished at Lowestoft.

==Relics==
Of monastic remains the most important are those of the great Benedictine abbey of Bury St Edmunds; the college of Clare, originally a cell to Bec Abbey in Normandy and afterwards to St Peters Westminster, converted into a college of secular canons in the reign of Henry VI, still retaining much of its ancient architecture, and now used as a boarding-school; the Decorated gateway of the Augustinian order priory of Butley; and the remains of the Grey Friars monastery at Dunwich.

A peculiarity of the church architecture is the use of flint for purposes of ornamentation, often of a very elaborate kind, especially on the porches and parapets of the towers. Another characteristic is the round towers, which are confined to East Anglia, but are considerably more numerous in Norfolk than in Suffolk, the principal being those of Little Saxham and Herringfleet, both good examples of Norman. It is questionable whether there are any remains of pre-Norman architecture in the county. The Decorated is well represented, but by far the greater proportion of the churches are Perpendicular Gothic, fine examples of which are so numerous that it is hard to select examples although the church of Blythburgh in the east and the exquisite ornate building at Lavenham in the west may be noted as typical, while the church of Long Melford, another fine example, should be mentioned on account of its remarkable lady chapel.

Remains of old castles include part of the walls of Bungay, the ancient stronghold of the Bigods; the picturesque ruins of Mettingham, built by John de Norwich in the reign of Edward III; Wingfield, surrounded by a deep moat, with the turret walls and the drawbridge still existing; the splendid ruin of Framlingham, with high and massive walls, founded in the 6th century, but restored in the 12th; the outlines of the extensive fortress of Clare Castle, anciently the baronial residence of the Earls of Clare; and the fine Norman keep of Orford Castle, on an eminence overlooking the sea. Among the many fine residences within the county there are several interesting examples of domestic architecture of the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. Hengrave Hall (c. 1530), north-west from Bury St Edmunds, is a noteworthy example an exceedingly picturesque building of brick and stone, enclosing a courtyard. Another is Helmingham Hall, a Tudor mansion of brick, surrounded by a moat crossed by a drawbridge. West Stow Manor is also Tudor; its gatehouse is fine, but the mansion has been adapted into a farmhouse.

The county has a number of Martello towers along its stretch of coastline, most of which were constructed during the first decade of the 19th century to guard against a potential invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s France.

<doc id="1291396" wikidata="Q6543028" url="?curid=1291396" title="License-free software">
<text>License-free software is computer software that is not explicitly in the public domain, but the authors appear to intend free use, modification, distribution and distribution of the modified software, similar to the freedoms defined for free software.

== Examples ==

Examples of license-free software formerly included programs written by Daniel J. Bernstein, such as qmail, djbdns, daemontools, and ucspi-tcp. Bernstein held the copyright and distributed these works without license until 2007. From December 28, 2007, onwards, he started placing his software in the public domain with an explicit waiver statement.

Additionally, small scripts are frequently released without specifying a license. For example, the website Userscripts.org hosts more than 52,000 Greasemonkey user scripts, the majority of which have no specified license. Similarly, GitHub reported in 2015 that 85% of the projects it hosts are unlicensed.

== Rights for users ==

On his &quot;Software users&#x27; rights&quot; web page, Bernstein explains his belief that under the terms of copyright law itself software users are always allowed to modify software for their personal use, regardless of license agreements. He says &#x27;&quot;If you think you need a license from the copyright holder, you&#x27;ve been bamboozled by Microsoft. As long as you&#x27;re not distributing the software, you have nothing to worry about.&quot;&quot;

He also says that software users are allowed to back up, compile, and run the software that they possess.

He further says that &quot;since it&#x27;s not copyright infringement for you to apply a patch, it&#x27;s also not copyright infringement for someone to give you a patch,&quot; noting the case of &quot;Galoob v. Nintendo&quot; as precedent. Thus modified versions of license-free software can legally be distributed in source code form in whatever way that the original can, by distributing a patch alongside it.

== Reception and discussion ==

Advocates of license-free software, such as Bernstein, argue that software licenses are harmful because they restrict the freedom to use software, and copyright law provides enough freedom without the need for licenses. Though having some restrictions, these licenses allow certain actions that are disallowed by copyright laws in some jurisdictions. If a license tries to restrict an action allowed by a copyright system, by Bernstein&#x27;s argument those restrictions can be ignored. In fact, Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;non-license&quot; of verbatim retransmission of source code is very similar in nature.

Similar positions on licenses are voiced by Free culture activist Nina Paley in 2010.

In 2013 Luis Villa argued similarly negative about the license usage of &quot;open source&quot;, when the small number projects licensed on GitHub were noticed, identifying a &quot;Post Open Source movement against the (license) permission culture&quot;.

<text>Fransaskois (; cf. Québécois), Franco-Saskatchewanais () or Franco-Saskatchewanians are French Canadians or Canadian francophones living in the province of Saskatchewan. According to the 2016 Canadian Census, approximately 17,735 residents of the province stated that French was their mother tongue. In the same census, 125,810 Saskatchewanians claimed full or partial French ancestry. There are several Fransaskois communities in Saskatchewan, although the majority of francophones in Saskatchewan reside in the province&#x27;s three largest cities, Saskatoon, Regina, and Prince Albert.

The first francophones to enter the region were French Canadian &quot;coureurs des bois&quot; employed in the North American fur trade during the 18th century. Francophone settlement into the region first occurred with French Canadian fur traders, along with Roman Catholic missionaries, and the Métis, during the mid 19th century. In 1885, a rebellion that included the French-speaking Métis broke out in the region. In the early 20th century, the provincial government attempted to assimilate the francophone minority into the anglophone majority by curtailing French language education in Saskatchewan. The enactment of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; in 1982 resulted in several decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada, that reaffirmed the educational, and judicial rights of the francophones in Saskatchewan.

==Demographics==
According to the 2016 Canadian Census, the number of people that reported French was their mother tongue in Saskatchewan was 17,735, or approximately 1.6 per cent of the population. French is the most common mother tongue in the province after English, Tagalog, German, and Cree (including Cree languages not otherwise specified). The majority of francophone Saskatchewanians are bilingual in English and French, with only 530 Fransaskois reporting they only had proficiency in French. There were 51,355 Saskatchewanians, approximately 4.7 per cent of the population, that reported being bilingual in both English and French; although the following figure includes francophone residents of the province, and Saskatchewanian who speak French as a second language.

Approximately 56 per cent of Fransaskois were born in Saskatchewan, with 29 per cent of francophones in the province born in another province or territory of Canada. Approximately 16 per cent of all francophones in Saskatchewan were born outside Canada. Among the Fransaskois that were born outside Canada, approximately 57 per cent originated from Africa, 22 per cent from Europe, 18 per cent from Asia, and 6 per cent from all other countries in the Americas.

In the 2016 census, 125,810 Saskatchewanians reported having partial or full French ancestry. French is the seventh most commonly reported ethnic group in Saskatchewan, after German, Canadian, English, Scottish, Irish, and Ukrainian.

===Communities===

Francophones in Saskatchewan are concentrated along three main areas of the province, the North and South Saskatchewan River, and in southern Saskatchewan. The majority of Fransaskois reside around the province&#x27;s largest cities, with three out of four Fransaskois&#x27; residing in Saskatoon, Regina, and Prince Albert. However, smaller communities of Fransaskois are also based in Gravelbourg, Albertville, Duck Lake, Zenon Park, Bellegarde, and St. Isidore-de-Bellevue.

==History==
In 1752, Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne was appointed commandant &quot;poste de l’Ouest&quot;. He embarked on an expedition along the northern coast of Lake Superior, through Fort Paskoya (Le Pas, Manitoba) and into what is today the province of Saskatchewan establishing Fort Saint-Louis, or what became known as Fort-à-la-Corne, near the forks of the Saskatchewan River. The area was the westernmost region of New France.

===19th century===
French Canadian &quot;coureurs de bois&quot; continued to utilize the territory after the British conquest of New France, in their pursuit of furs to trade with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) and the North-West Company. A number of French fur traders often had local First Nations women as their companions. While the majority of these couples were not formally married, the offspring that they produced often carried the French names of their fathers. Names like Dumont, Cardinal, Breland and Vandal are often associated with the French Métis. Between 1840 and 1880, several Métis communities developed in Batoche, Île-à-la-Crosse, St. Laurent de Grandin, and Willow Bunch.

In addition to French Canadian fur traders, and the Métis, Roman Catholic missionaries were among the first francophone settlers into the region, with several French missionaries dispatched to Qu&#x27;Appelle River valley (near present-day Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle in the early 19th century.

After the two fur trading companies were united in 1821, the French Métis settled along the Red River in Rupert&#x27;s Land, until the Deed of Surrender transferred the territory to Canada in 1870. As a result of the sale, a number of Métis left the Red River to seek out new lands in an attempt to return to their way of life. The vast majority landed on the banks of the Saskatchewan River in the area of Batoche and Duck Lake, although a dispute over land titles resulted in the North-West Rebellion; which saw the Métis eventually defeated at the Battle of Batoche in 1885 when. The rebellion&#x27;s leader, Louis Riel was later tried in court, the outcome of which became a major point of contention between English and French Canadians.
In 1892, the Northwest Territories abolished French as an official language.

===20th century===
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church aided the government in bringing new groups of immigrants to the prairies. The resulting immigration saw many arrive from Quebec who began establishing towns, schools, churches and businesses. The Canadian government worked to encourage French immigrants from France and Belgium, achieving some success in 1912 and 1913 as some 3000 French arrived in Canada in those two years.

At the turn of the century, the French-speaking settlers represented about 2.9% of the population. Five years after the foundation of the province of Saskatchewan in 1905, the French-speaking population represented 5.2%. The population grew from 2,600 to 25,000 in the first ten years of the twentieth century, and they would double their population during next two decades.

The French Canadians arriving in Saskatchewan were mostly farmers interested in developing the agricultural landscape of the province. Others worked to ensure the survival of the Catholic Church and the French language in the province. The first bishops of the west were French Canadians who believed that the survival of the Church was dependent on the survival of the mother tongue. In February 1912, 450 members of the Francophone community of Saskatchewan met at Duck Lake to form a provincial organization called &quot;La Sociéte du Parler Français de la Saskatchewan&quot;. Invited delegates included Bishop Mathieu of Regina, Bishop Charlebois of Keewatin and the Attorney General Alphonse Turgeon. Later that year the society would go on to form the &quot;Association Franco-Canadienne de la Saskatchewan&quot; (renamed the &quot;Assemblée communautaire fransaskoise&quot; of ACF in 1999) in an effort to protect the rights of Fransaskois&quot;.

The early 20th century saw efforts to curtail French language education, in an effort to assimilate the francophone minority with the anglophone majority. In 1916, several provincial organizations like the Saskatchewan Grain Growers, the Saskatchewan School Trustees’ Association, the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities resolved to forbid the use of foreign languages in Saskatchewan&#x27;s schools. Premier William Martin drafted an amendment to Section 177 of the School Act which limited French instruction to one hour a day. In response to the loss of the right to teach French in a public school in 1918, Franco-Catholic school trustees formed the &quot;Association des commissaries d’écoles franco-canadiens (ACEFC)&quot;. In 1918, Monsignor Mathieu Regina opened College Mathieu in Gravelbourg, a private institution that offered classical education in French. College Mathieu remained the only option for a French education in Saskatchewan for the next 75 years. It remained in operation as Western Canada&#x27;s only private French language secondary school until 2003, when it was absorbed by the province&#x27;s public francophone school system and renamed L&#x27;école Secondaire Collège Mathieu.

In 1982, Section 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; guaranteed minority education rights. The establishment of the Charter led to the Fransaskois community pushing for further linguistic rights through the judiciary. In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;R v Mercure&quot; that the &quot;North-West Territories Act&quot; still applied to its succeeding provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan), notably Section 110, which affords certain linguistic rights to francophones. However, the court also stated in its decision that said provinces were also permitted to legislate on matters of official languages, resulting in the passage of the &quot;Languages Act&quot; in Alberta, and &quot;The Language Act&quot; in Saskatchewan. Although both laws affirmed the right to use French in the judiciary and legislature, they also revoked many of the privileges accorded to francophones under the &quot;North-West Territories Act&quot;. Another Supreme Court decision (Mahe decision) in 1990 recognized the Fransaskois’ right to control their children’s education.

===21st century===
In 2003, the provincial government introduced its first policy on French-language support for certain provincial services. The year 2012 was proclaimed the Year of the Fransaskois Community in Saskatchewan by Minister Donna Harpauer in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the ACF.

==Politics==
The Francophone Affairs Branch (established as the Office of French Language Coordination) was established by the provincial government in 1990, and serves as the liaison between the provincial government and the Fransaskois community. Conversely, Fransaskois interests are represented by the &quot;Assemblée communautaire fransaskoise&quot;. The ACF originated from the Association Franco-Canadienne de la Saskatchewan, formed in 1912. The organization was renamed as the &quot;Association Catholique Franco-Canadienne&quot; in 1913. The association dropped the word &quot;catholique&quot; in favour of &quot;culturelle&quot; in 1962. The organization adopted the name &quot;L’Association Communautaire Fransaskoise&quot; in 1999, to further reflect the structural makeup of the organization. The ACF&#x27;s mandate is to represent the Fransaskois community in order to promote services protecting their rights.

===Access===
Under the provincial &quot;Languages Act&quot; passed in 1988, English serves as the official language of the province. English is the primary language of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, with legislation passed there permitted to be published in English only. However, the &quot;Languages Act&quot; does allow legislation to be published bilingually in English and French; and permits its members to address the legislature in the French language. Although the &quot;Languages Act&quot; permits the use of French in the legislature, it revoked many of the linguistic rights previously guaranteed to Fransaskois under Section 110 of the &quot;North-West Territories Act&quot;.

French is one of two official languages used in the provincial judiciary. The rights of francophones for the provincial judicial system was outlined in &quot;An Act Respecting the Use of the English and French Languages in Saskatchewan&quot;, passed in 1988 shortly after the Supreme Court decision on &quot;R v Mercure&quot;.

==Education==

French language education rights for minority francophone populations in Canada is guaranteed under Section 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, and is further reinforced by the province&#x27;s &quot;Education Act&quot;. The &quot;Conseil des écoles fransaskoises&quot; is the province&#x27;s only francophone school division, and encompasses the entire province. The francophone school board operates twelve elementary schools and two secondary schools; with a total enrolment of 1,603 students during the 2015–16 academic year.

There are no publicly-funded francophone post-secondary institutions in Saskatchewan. However, the University of Regina operates a bilingual English and French institution, &quot;La Cité universitaire francophone&quot;. The institution operates as a centre that provides a limited number of academic programs in the French-language, as well as some francophone services for the university.

===History===
Education in the French language occurred in the region as early as the 19th century, although saw efforts to curtail its instruction in the early 20th century. In 1911, the provincial government limited French language education was to Grade 1 of elementary school; before outright banning its instruction in 1931. Elementary school teachers were again permitted to teach the French language after an amendment to the provincial &quot;Education Act&quot; was enacted in 1968, allowing teachers to teach the language. Teachers in secondary school were permitted to teach French in 1971. Provisions made to the provincial &quot;Education Act&quot; in 1978 allowed for designated schools to use French as their primary language of instruction. Although these schools were open to francophones, they were administered by anglophone school boards, typically as French immersion schools.

Following the enactment of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, Fransaskois have pushed for the right to administer their own schools. Decisions passed by the Supreme Court in 1988 and 1990 asserted the fact that francophones the right to govern their own education. However, a separate public francophone school system was not implemented in the province until 1993. The province established eight public francophone school boards in 1995, all of which were eventually consolidated into the &quot;Conseil scolaire fransaskois&quot; in 1999.

==Culture==

The &quot;Conseil culturel fransaskois&quot; was established in 1974 as an organization that assists francophone cultural centres in the province. The organization is responsible for popularizing the term &quot;Fransaskois&quot; to refer to the French Canadian community in Saskatchewan. Fransaskois celebrate their vibrant culture regularly. Folk arts, visual arts, fine arts and performance arts all feature prominently in their festivals. The Fête fransaskoise festival is an annual francophone arts and culture festival held in June. The festival has been held since 1980, it has been an opportunity for Fransaskois to get together, express themselves and celebrate in French for a weekend and to preserve their roots.

A French-language professional theatre company, La Troupe du Jour, founded in 1987, operates from a base in Saskatoon. Gravelbourg&#x27;s Fransaskois community is the subject of a short documentary &quot;Les Fransaskois&quot;, produced for the documentary series &quot;The Grasslands Project&quot;.

The Fransaskois flag was created in 1979 to represent the community. The flag features a green cross on a field of yellow, with a red fleur-de-lis on the bottom right of the flag. The green represents both the boreal forest and the historic role of the Roman Catholic Church within the community; the yellow representing the Canadian Prairies; and the red fleur-de-lis representing Louis Riel&#x27;s struggle for francophone and Métis rights.

==Media==
===Print===
In 1910, a province-wide, French-language weekly &quot;Le Patriote de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; was established in the town of Duck Lake. In 1941, &quot;Le Patriote de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; merged with &quot;La Liberté&quot; a French-language weekly newspaper based in Saint-Boniface Manitoba, becoming &quot;La Liberté et le Patriote&quot;. In 1971, &quot;L&#x27;Eau vive&quot; became the new French-language weekly in Saskatchewan. &quot;L&#x27;Eau vive&quot;, is published in Regina.

Two community newspapers, &quot;Triangle News&quot; in Coronach and the &quot;Gravelbourg Tribune&quot; in Gravelbourg, publish content in both English and French.

===Radio===

The Fransaskois community is served primarily by the radio and television services of Radio-Canada, the country&#x27;s French language public broadcaster. Radio-Canada launched its French language first television station in Saskatchewan in 1976. Ici Radio-Canada Télé&#x27;s CBKFT-DT and Ici Radio-Canada Première&#x27;s CBKF-FM are based in Regina and have rebroadcasters throughout the province, while Regina and Saskatoon receive Ici Musique service from rebroadcasters of CKSB-FM in Winnipeg.

A privately owned bilingual community radio station, CKZP-FM, also operates in Zenon Park. In 2003, a privately owned community station, CFRG-FM, was launched in Gravelbourg by a new community group which has no ownership affiliation with the original CFRG. The original CFRG was one of two privately owned French language radio stations that operated in Saskatchewan prior to 1973. Programming at CFRG started in June 1952 at CFRG Gravelbourg; whereas the second station, CFNS, started broadcasting in November 1952 in Saskatoon. In 1973, Radio-Canada bought the two stations and has since taken a leading role in broadcasting French-language radio and French-language television across the province, featuring locally produced content in both mediums. The two radio stations became rebroadcasters of CBKF after their acquisition. Also included in this French language network are CBKF 860 kHz AM, Saskatoon, and CBKF-1 690 kHz AM Gravelbourg.

==Notable Fransaskois==

The most famous Fransaskoise, Jeanne Sauvé, born in Prud&#x27;Homme, served as a Liberal MP, Cabinet minister, Speaker of the House of Commons and ultimately Governor General of Canada. Another politician having Fransaskois heritage is Pierre Poilievre, who is an MP serving as Leader of the Conservative Party and leader of the Official Opposition; Poilievre&#x27;s adoptive father Donald was Fransaskois and their household was bilingual. In the arts, notable Fransaskois include sculptor Joe Fafard, folk music bands La Raquette à Claquettes and Hart-Rouge, and children&#x27;s entertainer Carmen Campagne (from the town of Willow Bunch). New upcoming artists such as Alexis Normand, Véronique Poulin and Shawn Jobin are becoming staples on the Fransaskois music scene, joining more established artists such as Annette Campagne, Chritianne Blondeau and Michel Lalonde. In sports, the most notable Fransaskois is NHL games-played record holder, Patrick Marleau, and Colorado Avalanche forward Blake Comeau of Meadow Lake. Comeau was a member of the 2004 Memorial Cup champion Kelowna Rockets and of two gold medal-winning World Junior Hockey championship teams.

<doc id="1291403" wikidata="Q5404146" url="?curid=1291403" title="Ethna Carbery">
<text>Ethna Carbery, born Anna Bella Johnston, (3 December 1864 – 2 April 1902) was an Irish journalist, writer and poet. She is best known for the ballad &quot;Roddy McCorley&quot; and the &quot;Song of Ciabhán&quot;; the latter was set to music by Ivor Gurney. In Belfast in the late 1890s, with Alice Milligan she produced &quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot;, a nationalist monthly of literature, history and comment that gained a wide circulation in Ireland and in the Irish diaspora. Her poetry was collected and published after her death under the pen name Ethna Carberry, adopted following her marriage to the poet Seumas MacManus in 1901.

==Life==
She was born Anna Bella Johnston on 3 December 1864 in the townland of Kirkinriola, Ballymena, County Antrim, the daughter of Robert Johnston, a timber merchant and a leading member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and Marjorie (Mage) Magee, who came from County Donegal.

Born in 1839 her father had grown up hearing stories from the last veteran United Irishmen who had fought at the Battle of Antrim and personally knew a number of Young Irelanders from the 1840s before himself becoming involved in the 1867 Fenian rising. He later oversaw the re-organisation of the IRB in the 1880s and had hosted many of the future readers of the Easter Rising in his Antrim Road home in Belfast. Carbery&#x27;s husband, the poet and folklorist Seumus MacManus, called Robert Johnston the &quot;…connecting link that kept the spirit of freedom alive throughout more than a century.&quot;

From the age of fifteen, when she had her first piece published, Carbery contributed poems and short stories to a number of Irish periodicals, including &quot;United Ireland&quot;, &quot;Young Ireland&quot;, the &quot;Nation&quot; and the &quot;Catholic Fireside&quot;.

She participated in the nationalist commemorations of the 1798 Rising and with Alice Milligan, Maud Gonne and others toured the country delivering lectures on the United Irishmen. In 1900 she was a founder-member of Inghinidhe na hÉireann, the revolutionary women&#x27;s organisation led by Maud Gonne. She was elected a vice-president of the association, along with Jenny Wyse Power, Annie Egan and Alice Furlong. She and Milligan wrote and produced plays as part of its cultural activities.

In October 1895, with Alice Milligan, she produced the &quot;Northern Patriot&quot;, the journal of the commemorative Henry Joy McCracken Literary Society. But after just four issues, she was dismissed. The sponsors were wary of an association with her father, an active &quot;Fenian&quot;. Milligan resigned in solidarity and, working out of the offices of Robert-Johnston&#x27;s timber yard, they launched their own independent monthly &quot;The Shan Van Vocht&quot;, producing forty issues. Leading literary revivalist Padraic Colum attributed its comparative success to &quot;a freshness that came from its femininity&quot;. Carberry (still Johnston) and Milligan were joined as prominent contributors by Alice Furlong, Katherine Tynan, Margaret Pender and Nora Hopper. The first issue, January 1896, gave an early platform to socialist republican James Connolly.

On 22 August 1901 she married Seumas MacManus (1867–1960), a contributor and moved with him to Revlin House, just outside Donegal Town in County Donegal in the west of Ulster. It was then that she began writing under the pen name of Ethna Carbery because once she took the last name of MacManus she didn&#x27;t want to be confused with her husband (also a writer).

Carbery died in Revlin House of gastritis on 2 April 1902, aged 37. Her husband, who was three years her junior, outlived her by 58 years. Although MacManus and Johnston were only married for one year her impact on his life ran deep. 
Her poetry was published by her husband after her death in &quot;The Four Winds of Erin&quot;, which was phenomenally successful over the next few years. Some further volumes followed. He also wrote a memoir dedicated to her.

At the fiftieth anniversary of her death, a public address was given by Sinead de Valera in which she stated that &quot;Among women poets Ethna Carbery would always hold the foremost place and, even though her life was short, it was full of devotion and idealism&quot; (&quot;Irish Press&quot; 2/4/1952).

<doc id="1291404" wikidata="Q5099420" url="?curid=1291404" title="Chimney Sweeps Islands">
<text>The Chimney Sweeps Islands are a pair of small islands located within New York City in the northern part of City Island Harbor in the borough of The Bronx. The islands, along with High Island, New York, divide City Island Harbor from Pelham Bay. The islands are entirely made out of bedrock. The islands are uninhabited, but are home to many birds, such as gulls, skuas, and great blue herons. The islands are owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, which acquired them in 1939 from the Chimney Sweeps Islands Corporation, a private group that used the islands for recreation, and are now a part of Pelham Bay Park.

There are two local legends about the origin of the islands&#x27; name. One is that from a distance the two islands look like Chimney Sweeps, which were brooms or tools used to clean and sweep out chimneys. The other was that a person that became rich sweeping chimneys bought the islands. A former owner of the islands, Mr. Russell Smith, suggested that the name originated in the now archaic usage of the term &quot;chimney&quot; to describe the flow of water between two rocks.

In the early 1900s, a family lived and operated a tavern on the islands.

<doc id="1291405" wikidata="Q3327535" url="?curid=1291405" title="Muhsin Muhammad">
<text>Muhsin Muhammad II (; born Melvin Darnell Campbell Jr. May 5, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for the Carolina Panthers and Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL). Muhammad played college football for Michigan State. He was selected by the Panthers in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft. Muhammad was a two-time Pro Bowl selection for the Panthers in 1999 and 2004 and also made the 2004 All-Pro Team. He was known for his nickname, &quot;Moose&quot;, and for his signature mustache, and touchdown dance, which was featured in one of the opening cameos of &quot;Madden NFL 2006&quot;.

==Early life==
Muhammad was born in Lansing, Michigan. His birth name was Melvin Campbell, but it was changed after his father converted to Islam when Muhammad was four years old.

Muhammad was mainly a soccer player in elementary school, but switched to football when he entered 8th grade. He attended Waverly High School in Lansing, Michigan, where he earned three letters in football and an additional two in basketball and track. Muhammad was also an all-state linebacker and running back at Waverly.

After graduating from high school, Muhammad played at Michigan State University. He enjoyed a breakout season in 1995 under coach Nick Saban with 50 catches for 867 yards and 3 touchdowns while playing with quarterback Tony Banks and wide receiver Derrick Mason.

==Professional career==
===Carolina Panthers (1996–2004)===
The Carolina Panthers selected Muhammad in the 1996 NFL draft&#x27;s second round with the 43rd overall pick. He was the ninth wide receiver selected. Muhammad made his NFL debut in Week 2 of the 1996 season against the New Orleans Saints. He had six receptions for 96 yards in the 22–20 victory. He recorded his first NFL touchdown on a 54-yard reception in Week 7 against the St. Louis Rams. He finished his rookie season with 25 receptions for 407 yards and one touchdown in nine games.

In the 1997 season, Muhammed recorded 27 receptions for 317 yards in 13 games. In the 1998 season, Muhammad led the Panthers with 68 receptions, six touchdowns, and 941 receiving yards.

Muhammad enjoyed an outstanding season in 1999 under new head coach George Seifert and his 96 receptions, eight touchdowns, and 1,253 receiving yards led to his first Pro Bowl selection. His 102 receptions during the 2000 season tied for the NFL lead. Muhammad averaged over 1,000 yards each season from 1998 to 2000.

Muhammad was injured for much of the 2001 NFL season, but he returned to form and eventually played a leading role in the Carolina Panthers&#x27; run to Super Bowl XXXVIII during 2003 NFL season. Though the Panthers lost to the AFC Champion New England Patriots 29–32, Muhammad recorded the longest touchdown reception (85 yards) in Super Bowl history.

Muhammad&#x27;s play during the 2004 season, where he led the NFL with a career-high 1,405 receiving yards and 16 receiving touchdowns, earned him his second Pro Bowl invitation. He earned first team All-Pro honors. By the end of the season, Muhammad held all of the Panthers&#x27; receiving records, including catches (578), receiving yards (7,751), 100-yard games (26), and the top three single-game yardage totals (192, 189, 179). In addition, he tied Wesley Walls at 44 touchdown receptions.

Muhammad, who was due a $10 million roster bonus, and the Panthers could not agree on a contract after the 2004 season, and the team released him in February 2005. Hours after his release, the Chicago Bears offered the 32-year-old a six-year contract, and Muhammad left Charlotte for Chicago.

Muhammad&#x27;s first stint with the Panthers was plagued with several negative experiences. He was the target of a racial slur from his quarterback, Kerry Collins; testified at murder hearings for Rae Carruth and Deidra Lane (wife of Fred Lane); and was arrested in 2003 on misdemeanor drug and weapon offenses.

===Chicago Bears (2005–2007)===
Muhammad became one of the Bears&#x27; receiving threats during his first year with the team. He was also credited with encouraging a stronger work ethic within the team&#x27;s receiving corps and advising young wide receivers such as Bernard Berrian, Mark Bradley, and Rashied Davis.

Despite failing to catch several poorly thrown passes from rookie quarterback Kyle Orton, Muhammad held himself responsible and promised reporters he would improve his performance. However, Muhammad was later seen complaining to Orton during a &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; game against the Atlanta Falcons. After Muhammad&#x27;s criticism, coach Lovie Smith benched Orton in favor of a fully recovered Rex Grossman.

Muhammad&#x27;s statistics improved with Rex Grossman at quarterback in the 2006 season. He had his first one hundred-yard day with the Bears in their season opener against the Green Bay Packers, and a second against the Minnesota Vikings during Week 3. However, he saw less action as Grossman began to play inconsistently after the season&#x27;s midway point. Muhammad defended Grossman from criticism and often supported him at press conferences. Muhammad finished the regular season as the team&#x27;s leading wide receiver for the second consecutive time.

Muhammad was the starting receiver for the Bears in Super Bowl XLI, making a touchdown reception in the first half of a 29–17 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. Muhammad became the third player in NFL history to score a Super Bowl touchdown with two different teams, joining Jerry Rice and Ricky Proehl.

Muhammad&#x27;s age seemingly affected his endurance. Although he played all sixteen games in 2006, the Bears listed him as probable or questionable before many games. Before the 2006 season, he revealed he had played through the 2005 season with a broken hand.

Muhammad had a down year in 2007 with 40 receptions for 570 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears released him on February 18, 2008.

After leaving the Bears, Muhammad told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Chicago is &quot;where wide receivers go to die.&quot; The remark caught the attention of Darryl Drake, the team&#x27;s wide receiver coach. While Drake stated he was unfazed by Muhammad&#x27;s remark, he argued former Bears wide receivers Bernard Berrian, Justin Gage, and Bobby Wade developed in Chicago and enjoyed successful careers after leaving.

===Carolina Panthers (second stint) (2008–2009)===
Just nine days after the Bears released him, Muhammad signed a two-year contract with his former team, the Carolina Panthers. On September 14, while playing against the Bears, he became the 29th player in NFL history to reach 10,000 career receiving yards. In Week 4, against the Atlanta Falcons, he had eight receptions for 147 yards and a touchdown in the 24–9 victory. He finished the season with 65 receptions for 923 yards and five touchdowns.

In the 2009 season, Muhammad caught 53 passes for 581 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown in 14 games and starts. After 14 seasons in the NFL, he retired from professional football. Muhammad, along with defensive end Julius Peppers, was added to the Panthers&#x27; Hall of Honor on October 29, 2023.

Muhammad won a Chicago Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement for Sports Programs for his segment, &quot;Hanging with the Moose&quot;, which aired on Comcast SportsNet&#x27;s &quot;SportsNite&quot; in 2005.

==Personal life==
Despite his father&#x27;s conversion to Islam, Muhammad is a Christian. He is married to Christa Muhammad. The couple have four daughters and two sons: (oldest to youngest) Jordan, Chase, Journey, Muhsin III, Maddon, and Kennedy. The family adopted Maddon and Journey from Ethiopia in 2007. Jordan is a member of the women&#x27;s basketball team at Princeton University. Chase is a member of the women&#x27;s basketball team at Johnson &amp; Wales University Charlotte. Muhsin III is a member of the Texas A&amp;M football team. Maddon is a member of the UNC Charlotte Track and Field team.

===Philanthropy===
Muhammad&#x27;s charity foundation, &quot;The M2 Foundation for Kids&quot;, is dedicated to improving the mental and physical development of children. He also supports the &quot;Back to Nature&quot; program which encourages children to spend more time with nature by taking them on hikes throughout the Great Smoky Mountains and nature preserves in Tennessee and the Muscular Dystrophy Association in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he raised funds and awareness for the group by helping organize Christmas toy drives and a special football camp. Muhammad is also a spokesperson for the Men For Change organization which helps raise money for impoverished women&#x27;s shelters.

On February 28, 2007, Muhammad&#x27;s high school alma mater gave him a special award for donating $50,000 worth of equipment to school&#x27;s fitness center, which was renamed in his honor.

The Carolina Panthers presented Muhammad with their &quot;Walter Payton Man of the Year&quot; award in 1999 for his charity and volunteer work.

<doc id="1291409" wikidata="Q6505483" url="?curid=1291409" title="Laydown delivery">
<text>Laydown delivery is a mode of delivery found in some nuclear gravity bombs: the bomb&#x27;s descent to the target is slowed by parachute so that it lands on the ground without detonating. The bomb then detonates by timer some time later. Laydown delivery requires the weapon to be reinforced so that it can survive the force of impact.

Laydown modes are used to make weapon delivery survivable by aircraft flying at low level. Low-altitude delivery helps hide the aircraft from surface-to-air missiles. The ground burst detonation of a laydown delivered weapon is used to increase the effect of the weapon&#x27;s blast on built-up targets such as submarine pens, or to transmit a shock wave through the ground to attack deeply-buried targets. An attack of this type produces large amounts of radioactive fallout.

==Weapons with laydown delivery options==
===United Kingdom===
The issue of aircraft survivability led to laydown being selected for the Vickers Valiant bomber of the Royal Air Force, as the design became increasingly vulnerable to Soviet weapons, especially the SA-2 missile. The low-level laydown delivery was referred to as &quot;Equipment 2 Foxtrot&quot; in RAF parlance; alternatives included &quot;2 Echo&quot; toss bombing and &quot;2 Hotel&quot;, a particular climbing delivery method used by the Avro Vulcan.

===United States===
* B28 bomb — Only in the RE (retarded external), RI (retarded internal) and FI (full-fuzing internal) versions of the weapon. The RE and RI versions of the weapon used the W28 mod 1 warhead and were an interim weapon only capable of laydown delivery at altitude, while the FI version using W28 Mod 2 and later warheads was capable of delivery.
* B53 bomb — Full-fuzing option (FUFO) weapon with laydown. The weapon later lost FUFO in its B53-1 upgrade in 1988, having only laydown fuzing.
* B61 bomb — Full-fuzing option (FUFO) weapon with laydown. Capable of laydown delivery at altitude.
* B83 bomb — Full-fuzing option (FUFO) weapon with laydown.

<text>Ollie Hopnoodle&#x27;s Haven of Bliss is a 1988 American made-for-television comedy film written by Jean Shepherd and directed by Dick Bartlett, based on the 1968 short story by Shepherd. A satire of childhood recollections of annual family vacations, it follows the Parker family (of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;) as they travel to a Michigan lakeside camp, the eponymous &quot;Haven&quot;. It was a co-production of The Disney Channel and PBS, and aired in that order, and was released on video.

==Plot==
The blue-collar working world of 1950s Indiana, with period-style footage and clips from Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;, is accompanied by Shepherd&#x27;s voiceover narration as the adult Ralph. The fourteen-year-old Ralph and friends, Flick and Schwartz, endure bureaucratic &quot;terminal official boredom&quot;, to get their &quot;working papers&quot;, to be able to apply for their first summer jobs.

The next day at breakfast, Ralph announces that he, Flick, and Schwartz have job interviews, and Mom notices that the family dog, Fuzzhead (Shepherd&#x27;s dog Daphne) seems to be missing. Adult Ralph describes this as the beginning of the &quot;Scary Fuzzhead Saga, which traumatized our family for years&quot;. The three friends interview at Scott&#x27;s Used Furniture Palace, where adult Ralph describes the owner as &quot;a cross between Rasputin and The Wolfman&quot; (played in the film by Shepherd himself). They are hired, in &quot;a truly historic moment&quot;. They fantasize about what they&#x27;ll do with all the money they&#x27;ll make. Clocking in on the job, they proceed to their first assignment - depicted in stock footage as enslaved workers descending to a dark basement. Mom calls the police to report Fuzzhead&#x27;s disappearance and announces to the Old Man, as he leaves for work, that she&#x27;s &quot;not going on any vacation&quot; until she is found. She posts hand-drawn &quot;reward&quot; posters for her return and places an ad in the newspaper. The Old Man, at the Bluebird, the neighborhood bar, laments the likely delay of his vacation. The first day of Ralph&#x27;s moving job is difficult and exhausting, as they struggle to move a mammoth refrigerator up five flights of stairs. At dinner Ralph is so sore and stiff his joints creak and pop. The next day, back on the job, they move an identical refrigerator up another seven flights of stairs. Over the next two weeks, Ralph &quot;toils ceaselessly&quot; at Scott&#x27;s, while Mom relentlessly &quot;like Ahab&quot; searches for Fuzzhead, with visits to dog pounds and repeatedly dragging the Old Man out to drive around looking for her. At night, Ralph has eerie nightmares, including a towering, laughing refrigerator. The next day, having seen Mom&#x27;s badly-sketched reward posters, &quot;people from three counties arrived with their mutts, trying for the big reward&quot;. Ralph&#x27;s summer job ends abruptly when they are fired. Then &quot;a miracle&quot; happens - the Old Man, driving around again with Mom, spots Fuzzhead in the rear window of a black Rolls-Royce, and gives chase, all the way to the home of the rich dowager at whose doorstep she appeared. She returns to the family home, left with &quot;only her memories&quot;, a montage of meals on crystal and pampered treatment. At dinner, Ralph fibs, saying he quit his job to spend time with the family. As a result, they are free to pack and, as adult Ralph describes, begin their &quot;epic&quot; road trip.

The trip includes drastic overpacking of the brown Chevy sedan, a reluctant starter motor, an endlessly carsick and complaining Randy, side trips to shop for unnecessary &quot;slob art&quot;, a flat tire, running out of gas as the Old Man insists on only &quot;Texas Royal Supreme Blue&quot; gasoline, a misadventure at a gas station with an unseen enormous growling &quot;meers hound&quot;, a boiled-over radiator as an occasion for a roadside picnic, and a missed detour sign and resulting circular detour due to squabbling among the kids. In the middle of a pasture, as cows surround the car, adult Ralph describes the scene: &quot;beset on all sides by strange creatures, the lost mariner searches and searches, in the Sargasso sea of life&quot;. Rounding out the road trip, more unnecessary shopping, a Dutch lawn windmill being bought and put on top of the car, Ralph&#x27;s confession of forgetting the fishing tackle, being stuck behind a live poultry truck, and panic over another &quot;magically appearing&quot; carbound bee. When they finally arrive at Clear Lake, the Old Man learns that the fish have stopped biting. Ralph discovers the Old Man had packed the fishing tackle after all, and they walk out onto the boat ramp to take in the view, as a few drops of rain fall. A torrential downpour develops, and in the cabin, leaks from the roof drip into every available pot and basin, as adult Ralph describes, all day, every day of their vacation. At bedtime, Mom reassures him that the Old Man loves him, even though he never calls him by his real name (just &quot;watermelon&quot;, &quot;radish-top&quot;, &quot;cookie cutter&quot;, etc.). A lightning strike knocks out power to the rain-drenched lakeside camp&#x27;s welcome sign, and the credits roll.

==Story and early screenplay==
Shepherd originally wrote the story, upon which the film is based, in 1968 as one of a series for &quot;Playboy Magazine&quot; between 1966 and 1970. The stories were later published in Shepherd&#x27;s collection &quot;Wanda Hickey&#x27;s Night of Golden Memories&quot; in 1971. Shepherd later described his stories as not based literally on childhood memories: &quot;People are always trying to make me sound like I&#x27;m just writing what happened to me. You know, I&#x27;m a humorist and a filmmaker. I don&#x27;t think my stuff is any more autobiographical than, say, Woody Allen&#x27;s is - or anybody who is involved in making serious films.&quot;

Television comedy director John Rich wrote in his memoir that in the 1970s he commissioned Shepherd to write a screenplay from &quot;Hopnoodle&#x27;s&quot;, as a possible series pilot episode for the ABC television network. He described the script as quite faithful to the story, but problems with management during production prevented that script from being released on American television.

===Production===
The film was a co-production of &quot;Disney, public TV&#x27;s &quot;American Playhouse&quot; and Boston public TV station WGBH&quot;, funded by Disney, under the terms, according to Shepherd, that &quot;they would have nothing to do with production.&quot; Fred Barzyk was producer for this film, as he was for Shepherd&#x27;s other work for WGBH. 
It was produced from Shepherd&#x27;s studio in Florida, and exterior scenes were shot in several locations around Dallas, Texas, to stand in for the film&#x27;s &quot;Hohman, Indiana&quot;.

===Releases===
The film originally aired numerous times on the Disney Channel beginning August 6, 1988, then shortly thereafter on PBS nationwide, and was released by Walt Disney Home Video on VHS in 1993.

==Recognition==
The film was nominated for a Cable ACE Award for &quot;Best Movie or Miniseries&quot; in 1988.

===Reception===
Reviews ranged from mildly negative to positive. Upon its inaugural airing on the Disney Channel in 1988, The Lexington &quot;Herald-Leader&quot; called the film &quot;pleasant&quot;, but thought the beginning of the film might seem too similar to &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; to viewers unfamiliar with Shepherd&#x27;s work. Daniel Ruth of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars, described it as &quot;cute&quot;, and a &quot;wistful, yet chaotic drive down memory lane&quot;, and stated, Shepherd &quot;never loses&quot; his &quot;ability to see the world through a child&#x27;s eyes&quot;.

In 1989, prior to the film&#x27;s broadcast on PBS, Irv Letovsky of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was blasé, calling the film, &quot;a lot of cute&quot;, but &quot;though cute, this is sort of a compendium of how things used to be&quot;, also noting that &quot;some of the older generation might enjoy the diversion.&quot; &quot;New Jersey Star-Ledger&quot; reviewer Jerry Krupnick found the film &quot;hilarious&quot; and &quot;super fun&quot;, but declared that the role Shepherd took on for himself in the first 30 minutes of the film only stretched a &quot;nifty 90-minute comedy&quot; to two hours, and made it &quot;cluttered&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed &quot;Ollie Hopnoodle&quot; as a &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice&quot; for viewers in 1989.

==Sequels==
&quot;Ollie Hopnoodle&#x27;s Haven of Bliss&quot; was the last film of the Parker Family film series to be produced and distributed for television. By this time, Shepherd was making far more money from the reruns and home video sales from &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; and decided to focus on producing another feature film. The film&#x27;s direct follow-up, &quot;It Runs in the Family: My Summer Story&quot;, was released in 1994 in theaters.

<text>Jan Decleir (born as &quot;Jan Amanda Gustaaf Decleir&quot; on 14 February 1946) is a prolific Belgian movie and stage actor born in Niel, Antwerp.

==Career==
He had his first big role in Fons Rademakers&#x27;s &quot;Mira&quot; (1971). Since then, he has appeared in countless Flemish and Dutch films and TV productions. In the world of theater he gained his fame by acting at the International New Scene for the play Mistero Buffo by Dario Fo. 
To the larger audiences of television he became known through his role of &quot;Sil de strandjutter&quot; in 1976 in the equally named TV series. He starred in Academy Award winning movies including &quot;Karakter&quot; by Mike van Diem and &quot;Antonia&quot; and the Oscar-nominated social drama &quot;Daens&quot;. More recently he turned down roles in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (due to commitments to other projects) and the James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. Decleir was also Belgium&#x27;s national performer of Sinterklaas from 1993 until 2019.

In 2003 he had the starring role in the critically acclaimed thriller &quot;The Memory of a Killer&quot; (The Alzheimer Case) of which the leading American critic Roger Ebert wrote in his review: &quot;&quot;Jan Decleir never goes for the easy effect, never pushes too hard, is a rock-solid occupant of his character. Everything he has to say is embodied, not expressed. Talks are underway for a Hollywood remake, but this performance will not be easily equaled. Gene Hackman, maybe. Morgan Freeman. Robert Mitchum, if he were alive. Decleir is the real thing.&quot;&quot;

For several years he also led the Studio Herman Teirnlick where he brought in many new teachers: actors from various theater companies (e.g., de Blauwe Maandag Compagnie, STAN, etc.). 

==Personal life==
Jan Decleir has been married to Brechtje Louwaard since 1 April 2006. He was previously married to Caroline van Gastel with whom he has 3 children (Sofie, Jenne and Flor). Both his siblings – sister Reinhilde Decleir (died in 2022) and brother Dirk Decleir (died in 1974) involved in acting, too.

==Honors and awards==
Over the lifespan of his career, Jan Decleir has received several prizes for his acting. He was awarded the Best Actor Award for his role in &quot;Off Screen&quot; (directed by Pieter Kuijpers) at the Montreal World Film Festival. In 2003 he received Golden Calf Culture Prize (Dutch: &quot;Gouden Kalf&quot;) and in 2007 a Golden Calf for Best Supporting Actor for the movie &quot;Wolfsbergen&quot; at the Netherlands Film Festival.
In 2008 he was awarded the best actor prize at the Tiburon International Film Festival for his role in &quot;Man zkt vrouw (A Perfect Match)&quot;. 
For his role in &quot;The Barons&quot;, he received the Magritte Award for Best Supporting Actor.
In 2013 he also received the Flemish Culture Prize for General Cultural Merit.

<text>Hokus Pick (or Hokus Pick ) was a Christian rock band that was together from 1989 to 1999. The four members of Hokus Pick met in Vancouver, British Columbia. Hokus Pick was well known for their quirky sense of humour, using sarcasm, satire, and general silliness to convey a deeper message.

Hokus Pick toured extensively in Canada and the United States. The band opened for Steve Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Squinternational&quot; tour in 1994 and played in Costa Rica in May 1998. The group released their final album in 1999, opting to spend more time with their families after more than a decade of recording and touring together. They have remained active in music ministry and the industry.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music&quot; cites their song &quot;I&#x27;m So Happy&quot; as possibly the worst CCM song of all time. The song is a satire of simplistic lyrics often heard on Christian radio. Ironically, it received heavy rotation on Christian stations.

In October 2007 Hokus Pick received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian Gospel Music Association at the 29th Annual Covenant Awards in Calgary, Alberta. Hokus Pick then performed live and hosted the 30th Annual Covenant Awards on October 24, 2008.

Rumours abounded that Hokus Pick was planning a comeback into music, after having been spotted in a secluded warehouse jamming together. Filmmaking company Transposition Films, composed of legendary members itself, avoided questions regarding their involvement in filming a documentary about the process.

<text>My Summer Story (originally released in theaters as It Runs in the Family) is a 1994 American comedy film directed by Bob Clark that serves as a sequel to his 1983 film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;. Like the previous film, it is based on semi-autobiographical stories by Jean Shepherd, primarily from his book &quot;In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash&quot;.

The opening makes direct reference to the events of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, and the ending narration strongly parallels it; production delays forced most of the characters to be recast. Charles Grodin stars as the Old Man (Mr. Parker), Mary Steenburgen plays Mrs. Parker, and Kieran Culkin is Ralphie. Shepherd provides the narration, just as he had done for &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;.

Two sequels followed the film. The first, &quot;A Christmas Story 2&quot;, was released straight to DVD in 2012. The second, &quot;A Christmas Story Christmas&quot;, was released on HBO Max in 2022 and features most of the original cast from the original 1983 film returning.

==Plot==
The film takes place in the summer of 1941, after the events of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, which took place in December 1940. It has several plotlines, one each for 10-year-old Ralphie, his father, and his mother, followed by a recurring subplot involving him and his dad on a fishing trip, that proves frequently fruitless until a single night when all fish are caught. This also feeds a needless obsession in Ralphie&#x27;s 7-year-old brother Randy, much to Mrs. Parker&#x27;s nerve.

===Ralphie&#x27;s plot===
Ralphie&#x27;s plot for most of the film is to find a top tough enough to knock that of a bully&#x27;s out of a chalk circle in a game of &quot;Kill&quot;. Scut Farkus, the 13-year-old main bully, was demoted following the events of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, with a new head bully, Lug Ditka, taking his place and ruling over the school. Despite his firm standing, Ralphie&#x27;s tops are always defeated by Lug&#x27;s top Mariah, prompting Ralphie to look for outside sources that also backfire, such as a top bought from an Eastern shop that is painted with roses, giving Lug all the mocking material. During the Parker family&#x27;s visit to the world&#x27;s fair, Ralphie gets a top from a gypsy stand called &quot;Wolf&quot; just as powerful as Mariah, allowing Ralphie to challenge him again. At the climax of the challenge, both Mariah and Wolf end up disappearing into the sewer, never to be seen again; as a result, the game ends on a lose-lose draw.

===Mrs. Parker&#x27;s plot===
Mrs. Parker&#x27;s plot revolves around attempting to start a collection of celebrity dishes, one per each dish night, at the Orpheum Theatre run by Leopold Doppler. She acquires the first dish, a Ronald Colman gravy boat, though she accumulates more as Doppler announces the other dishes are unavailable due to &#x27;misshipment&#x27;. The frustration of accumulating the gravy boats combined with the events throughout the film get Mrs. Parker over the edge, resulting with her throwing the gravy boat she won at the theater at Doppler&#x27;s head. All other housewives, encouraged by Mrs. Parker&#x27;s act, also start raining down the surplus gravy boats towards Doppler, enraged at the frustration and the apparent fraudulent scheme. Mrs. Parker is arrested for the act, though with a relieved smile on her face.

===Mr. Parker&#x27;s plot===
Mr. Parker&#x27;s plot revolves around his odds with the Parker&#x27;s hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses (or Bumpi, as the Parkers tend to refer them in plural), especially due to their loud overplaying of hillbilly music, obnoxious behavior and the constant harassment on Mr. Parker by the Bumpuses&#x27; forty-three Bloodhounds named Big Red. The escalation turns into war when the Bumpuses inaugurate an outhouse bathroom, which Parker clearly perceives as a health code violation. When Mr. Parker attempts forcing the Bumpuses to demolish the outhouse, they respond by having Big Dickie, the largest of the Bumpus family, destroy their house&#x27;s porch as a show of force. Parker attempts unsuccessfully to torment the Bumpuses with music, which they mistake for Parker calling a night party, prompting him to hurriedly escape to the fishing trip with Ralphie. Mr. Parker does a second attempt, this time with a sound effects record disk simulating a federal bust, but by the time he unleashes the sound disk, the Bumpuses have long moved away. Mr. Parker interprets this as a defeat, and the act earns the ire of the woken-up neighborhood, who strongly suggest to bring the Bumpuses back and be rid of Parker.

==Cast==
* Charles Grodin as Mr. Parker, the Old Man
* Mary Steenburgen as Mrs. Parker
* Kieran Culkin as Ralph &quot;Ralphie&quot; Parker
* Jean Shepherd as Ralph Parker/the Narrator
* Christian Culkin as Randy Parker
* Whit Hertford as &quot;Lug&quot;
* Chris Owen as &quot;Scut&quot; Farkus
* Geoffrey Wigdor as Flick
* David Zahorsky as Schwartz
* Tedde Moore as Miss Shields
* T.J. McInturff as Grover Dill
* Glenn Shadix as Leopold Doppler, Manager of the Orpheum Theater
* Roy Brocksmith as Mr. Winchell, The Assessor

==Production==
Shepherd had begun work on the film in 1989, after wrapping up production on the television film &quot;Ollie Hopnoodle&#x27;s Haven of Bliss&quot;. He admitted making the sequel mainly as a money-making enterprise; when he saw the amount of royalties he was making off telecasts and re-releases of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; compared to his television productions, he walked away from television and vowed to work almost exclusively on films. Because the cast of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; had aged to the point where they no longer fit their roles, it was entirely recast, with the exception of Tedde Moore, who returns as Ralphie&#x27;s teacher, Miss Shields.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B+, noting that the film improves on &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, with better pacing and better-defined characters, but found Shepherd&#x27;s narration to be &quot;oh-so-drolly exaggerated&quot; and &quot;condescending&quot;. Robert Butler at &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; called it &quot;a sequel worth seeing&quot; which revisits the humor of the original.

Upon the release of the film on DVD in 2006, DVDtalk wrote that &quot;My Summer Story&quot; is reasonably good&quot;, while criticizing the casting, but praising Shepherd&#x27;s narration as &quot;the film&#x27;s saving grace&quot;. Christopher Null at MovieCritic.com referred to the film as a &quot;lackluster sequel&quot; with &quot;little of the same charm&quot; as &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, and not &quot;funny&quot;. A 2011 summary of best and worst movies filmed in Cleveland called the film a &quot;dog&quot;, which &quot;features none of the original cast&quot; and &quot;none of the original heart&quot;.

Released in few theaters, the film grossed under $71,000.

==Related works==
Prior to the making of the theatrical film, PBS co-produced a series of TV movies based on the Parker family for &quot;American Playhouse&quot; including &quot;Ollie Hopnoodle&#x27;s Haven of Bliss&quot;, &quot;The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters&quot;, &quot;The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Open Hearth&quot;.

<text>Millwall Dock is a dock at Millwall, London, England, located south of Canary Wharf on the Isle of Dogs.

==History==

The scheme was developed speculatively by a partnership of John Kelk and John Aird &amp; Co. The engineer responsible for designing the scheme was Sir John Fowler. The construction was undertaken by Kelk and Aird and the dock was officially opened in March 1868. After a slow start to the business and financial difficulties, Kelk and Aird surrendered control of the company to lawyers acting for the investors in December 1868. In recognition of its settled status the business was renamed the Millwall Dock Company in 1870.

From 1897 to 1921, it was served by the Millwall Docks railway station on the Millwall Extension Railway, with goods services continuing to the 1970s. 

In 1909 the Port of London Authority (PLA) took over the Millwall Dock, along with the other enclosed docks from St Katharines to Tilbury.

From 1905 Magnus Mowat worked as Engineer to the docks, being promoted to Director around 1912. 

With reorganisation by the Port of London Authority in the 1920s, the northern end of the Inner Dock was connected to the West India Docks by the Millwall Passage.

The dock was used mainly for timber and grain, a trade which eventually moved down river to the Port of Tilbury with the construction of a major grain terminal in the 1960s. A McDougall&#x27;s flour mill, the Wheatsheaf Mill (constructed in 1869), stood on the south side of the Outer Dock, but was demolished in about 1980. Nearby Sir John McDougall Gardens is named after one of the McDougall brothers, John McDougall, who was also a prominent local politician in Poplar.

From the 1960s onwards, the Millwall Dock experienced a steady decline – as did all of London&#x27;s other docks – as the shipping industry adopted containerisation, which effectively moved traffic downstream to Tilbury. It finally closed to commercial traffic along with the other Royal Docks in 1981.

The West Ferry Printing Works, the largest newspaper print works in Western Europe, was built on the north side of Outer Dock between 1984 and 1986.

The Docklands Sailing and Watersports Centre, located at the far West end of the dock where the dock previously connected to the Thames, was established by the London Docklands Development Corporation and the Sports Council at a cost of £1.2 million in 1989.

While much of the area has been occupied by commercial office towers, Millwall Dock is also an area where several housing developments and apartment towers have been developed. During the 1980s the Clippers Quay housing estate was built around the old dry dock while the Mill Quay housing development was built on the site of the old Wheatsheaf Mill.

The dock was a location for boat stunts in the 1999 James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;.

==Layout==
The dock is L-shaped, with an &#x27;Outer Dock&#x27; running east–west, and an &#x27;Inner Dock&#x27; running north from the eastern end. It originally contained around 36 acres (14 hectares) of water and had a 200-acre (81 hectare) estate. The western end of the Outer Dock was originally connected to the Thames at Millwall by an wide channel. The spoil from the docks formed the area of wasteland known as the Mudchute. A graving dock for ship repairs was constructed at the south-east corner of the Outer Dock (one of 6 originally planned), and later lengthened to .

<text>A Caganer () is a figurine depicted in the act of defecation appearing in nativity scenes in Catalonia and neighbouring areas such as Andorra, Valencia, Balearic Islands, and Northern Catalonia (in southern France). It is most popular and widespread in these areas, but can also be found in other areas of Spain (Murcia), Portugal, and Southern Italy (Naples).

The name &quot;&quot; literally means &quot;the pooper&quot;. Traditionally, the figurine is depicted as a peasant, wearing the traditional Catalan red cap (the barretina) and with his trousers down, showing a bare backside, and defecating.

== Origins ==
The exact origin of the Caganer is unknown, but the tradition has existed since at least the 18th century. According to the society Amics del Caganer (Friends of the Caganer), it is believed to have entered the nativity scene by the late 17th or early 18th century, during the Baroque period.

== Tradition ==
In Catalan Countries, as well as in the rest of Spain and in most of Italy and Southern France, traditional Christmas decorations often consist of a large model of the city of Bethlehem, similar to the Nativity scenes of the English-speaking world but encompassing the entire city rather than just the typical manger scene. This is often a reproduction of a pastoral scene—a traditional Catalan (farmhouse) as the central setting with the child in a manger, and outlying scenes including a washerwoman by a river, a woman spinning, shepherds herding their sheep or walking towards the manger with gifts, the Three Wise Men approaching on camel back, a scene with the angel and shepherds, the star pointing the way, etc. Commonly materials such as moss will be used to represent grass, with cork used to represent mountains or cliffs.

The caganer is a particular and highly popular feature of modern Catalan nativity scenes. It is believed to have entered the nativity scene by the late 17th or early 18th century, during the Baroque period. Eminent folklorist Joan Amades called it an essential piece and the most popular figure of the nativity scene. It can also be found in other parts of southwestern Europe, including Murcia, the region just south of Valencia in Spain (where they are called ), Naples ( or ) and Portugal (). There is a sculpture of a person defecating hidden inside the cathedral of Ciudad Rodrigo, Province of Salamanca, though this is not part of a nativity scene. Accompanying Mary, Joseph, Jesus, the shepherds and company, the caganer is often tucked away in a corner of the model, typically nowhere near the manger scene. A tradition in Catalonia is to have children find the hidden figure.

== Explanations ==

Possible reasons for placing a figure representing a person in the act of emptying his bowels in a scene which is widely considered holy include:
* The Caganer, by creating faeces, is fertilizing the Earth. According to the ethnographer Joan Amades, it was a &quot;customary figure in nativity scenes [pessebres] in the 19th century, because people believed that this deposit [symbolically] fertilized the ground of the nativity scenes, which became fertile and ensured the nativity scene for the following year, and with it, the health of body and peace of mind required to make the nativity scene, with the joy and happiness brought by Christmas near the hearth. Placing this figurine in the nativity scene brought good luck and joy and not doing so brought adversity.&quot;
* Many modern caganers represent celebrities and authority figures. By representing them with their pants down, the caganer serves as a levelling device to bring the mighty down.
* As to the charge of blasphemy, as Catalan anthropologist Miguel Delgado has pointed out, the grotesque, rather than a negation of the divine may actually signify an intensification of the sacred, for what could be more grotesque than the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, a bloody public torture and execution as the defining moment in the story of Christianity?
* In his essay (&quot;The Civic Virtues of the Defecator&quot;), American anthropologist Brad Erickson argues that Catalans use the caganer to process and respond to contemporary social issues such as immigration and the imposition of public civility regulations.

Further opinions:
* &quot;The caganer was the most mischievous and out-of-place character of the pessebre&#x27;s [otherwise] idyllic landscape; he was the &quot;Other&quot;, with everything that entails, and as the &quot;Other&quot;, was accepted, in a liberal vein, as long as he did not aim to occupy the foreground. The caganer represented the spoilsport that we all have inside of us, and that&#x27;s why it is not surprising that it was the most beloved figure among the children and, above all, the adolescents, who were already beginning to feel rather like outsiders at the family celebration.&quot; 
* &quot;The caganer is a hidden figure and yet is always sought out like the lost link between transcendence and contingency. Without the caganer, there would be no nativity scene but rather a liturgy, and there would be no real country but just the false landscape of a model.&quot; Joan Barril
* &quot;The caganer seems to provide a counterpoint to so much ornamental hullabaloo, so much emotive treacle, so much contrived beauty.&quot; 
* &quot;The caganer is, like so many other things that have undergone the filtering of a great many generations, a cult object; with the playful, aesthetic and superficial devotion that we feel towards all the silly things that fascinate us deep down.&quot; 

== Similar traditions ==
The Caganer is not the only defecating character in the Catalan Christmas tradition—another is the &quot;Tió de Nadal&quot;, which also makes extensive use of the image of faecal matter (it is a log, i.e. tió which, having been &quot;fed&quot; for several weeks, is told to defecate on Christmas Eve and &quot;magically&quot; produces candy for children, a candy that has supposedly come from its bowels). Other mentions of faeces and defecation are common in Catalan folklore: indeed, a popular Catalan saying for use before a meal is (&quot;Eat well, shit heartily, and don&#x27;t be afraid of death!&quot;). In his book &quot;Barcelona&quot;, architecture critic and locale historian Robert Hughes gives a good introduction to this earthy tradition.

The Caganer can also be found in other European cultures, either as an import or a minor local tradition:
*In France: &quot;Père la Colique&quot; (&quot;Father Colic&quot;). In France this figure seems to date from the 1930s or 1940s.
* In Murcia, the region just south of the Valencian Community in Spain (where they are called &quot;cagones&quot;)
* The Naples area, where it is known as &quot;cacone&quot; or &quot;pastore che caca&quot;
* Portugal, where they are known as &quot;cagões&quot;

== Traditional vs. modern portrayals ==
The traditional caganer is portrayed as a Catalan peasant man (i.e. a farmer or shepherd) wearing a typical hat called a Barretina—a red stocking hat with a black band. At least since the late 1970s, the figure of a traditional Catalan peasant woman was also added, wearing traditional garb including the long black hairnet.

The Catalans have modified this tradition a good deal since the 1940s. In addition to the traditional caganer design, one can easily find other characters assuming the Caganer position, such as nuns, devils, Santa Claus, celebrities, athletes, historical figures, politicians, Spanish royalty, British royalty, and other famous people past and present. Just days after his election as US president in 2008, a &quot;pooper&quot; of Barack Obama was made available.
A digital greeting card depicting a caganer can be produced using the &quot;christmas&quot; package in R, a free software environment for statistical computing. The following code produces the image:
install.packages(&quot;christmas&quot;)
library(christmas)
xmascaganer(year = 2025)
== At markets and exhibits ==
Caganers are easiest to find before Christmas in holiday markets, like the one in front of the Cathedral of Santa Eulalia, which has many tables of Caganers. Every year new figures are created, and some people collect them. Caganers are the focal point of at least one association (Els Amics del Caganer, i.e. Friends of the Caganer), which puts out a regular bulletin (&quot;El Caganòfil&quot;), and have even been featured in art exhibits.

In recent years a urinating statue, or Pixaner, has also appeared, but it has not taken root or gained any serious popularity.

== Controversy surrounding Barcelona&#x27;s civility ordinance ==

In 2005, the Barcelona city council provoked a public outcry by commissioning a nativity scene which did not include a caganer. The local government was reported to have countered these criticisms by claiming that the Caganer was not included because a civility ordinance had made public defecation and public urination illegal, meaning that the caganer was now setting a bad example. Many saw this as an attack on Catalan traditions. One writer of a letter to the editor asserted, &quot;A nativity scene without a caganer is not a nativity scene.&quot; A second writer offered a win-win solution. He suggested including the caganer but also placing a figure of a police officer with a pen and clipboard next to him, writing a ticket for the infraction. The writer said this would achieve three objectives: respect tradition, comply with the ordinance and educate the public about how it is being reinforced, and finally, demonstrate how important it is to respect the law. Finally, the head of Parks and Gardens publicly denied prohibiting the caganer in the first place, saying that it was the artistic decision of the artist commissioned by the city to design and install the pessebre. Following a campaign against the caganer&#x27;s absence called (Save the caganer), and widespread media criticism, the 2006 nativity restored the caganer, who appeared on the northern side of the nativity near a dry riverbed.

<text>Deutz AG is a German internal combustion engine manufacturer, based in Porz, Cologne, Germany.

==History==

The company was founded by Nicolaus Otto, the inventor of the four-stroke internal combustion engine, and his partner Eugen Langen on 31 March 1864, as N. A. Otto &amp; Cie, later renamed to Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz after moving operations in 1869, from Cologne to Deutz, located on the opposite side of the Rhine.

In the early years, Otto and Langen were interested only in producing stationary engines, not automobiles. The technical director, Gottlieb Daimler, was eager to produce automobiles. In the middle of the 1870s, it was suggested that he transfer to the company&#x27;s St. Petersburg factory to reduce his influence. He resigned, taking Wilhelm Maybach with him. Deutz also produced agricultural machines such as Combine harvesters and Tractors, as well as Commercial Vehicles such as Trucks and Buses.

In 1884, Edouard Sarazin, a Belgian patents Lawyer and Pioneer of automotive engineering, represented &#x27;Gasmotorenfabrik Otto &amp; Langen&#x27; (Deutz AG) and acquired the license to build Deutz engines in France, which he duly contracted to Perin, Panhard &amp; Cie (later Panhard et Levassor) in Paris. Around 1886/1887, he similarly acquired licenses to build Daimler engines. His untimely death in 1887, left his widow Louise to develop the business relationships and complete the partnership negotiations. 

Famous people who have worked for Deutz include Eugen Langen, Nicolaus Otto, Gottlieb Daimler (from 1872 until 1880), Wilhelm Maybach (from 1872 until 1880), Prosper L&#x27;Orange (from 1904 until October 1908), Ettore Bugatti (in 1907), and Robert Bosch.

During World War II, the company was ordered to produce artillery and operated under the name Klöckner Humboldt Deutz AG (KHD). In 1942, KHD was declared a war model company by the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Front for its &quot;services to the defense economy&quot;. In this context, the company relied heavily on the use of forced laborers. In the 1942/1943 financial year, 2127 people, mainly from Western Europe, were forced to work at KHD. In some cases, up to 40 percent of the workers in the plants were forced laborers. The factory was almost destroyed by an air raid on the night of the 3rd and 4th of July 1943 (→ Bombing of Cologne in WW II).

From 1892 to 1970, Deutz built locomotives in the power range from 4 HP to 2000 HP; until 1927, with gasoline engines, and from 1927, increasingly with diesel engine drive.

Commercial vehicles powered by Deutz engines were popular from 1960 to 1980. Fire engines built by &quot;Magirus&quot; in Ulm, Southern Germany, used an M-shaped logo, with the steeple of the world&#x27;s tallest church, the Ulm Minster, in its center. After the Magirus-Deutz merger, the company continued to use this logo even though the twin towers of the Cologne Cathedral can be seen from the company headquarters.

Deutz&#x27;s head office is in the Porz district of Cologne and, as of 2004, was manufacturing liquid and air-cooled diesel engines. The larger engines in the Deutz range were manufactured in Mannheim at a production facility that once belonged to Süddeutsche Bremsen-AG as MWM-Diesel. Deutz also has production facilities in other countries, including Spain, and a joint venture production facility in China. After Deutz took over, the plant specialized in marine engines. This facility now produces engines for marine and power generation, which can run on either fuel oils or fuel gases (including landfill gas). In 1995 Deutz sold its agricultural machinery division – Deutz-Fahr – to the Italian company SAME, forming SAME Deutz-Fahr.

In February 2022, CEO Frank Hiller was dismissed and replaced by the supervisory board. Sebastian Schulte replaced him as the interim CEO &amp; CFO. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Bernd Bohr, resigned. His successor was Dietmar Voggenreiter.

==Engines==

Deutz engines are available in the power range of 5 to 500 kW, with air, oil or water cooling and with life expectancy of 20,000 to 30,000 running hours TBO (Time Between Overhauling) on rebuilt and brand-new units.

Parts and services are available worldwide. A network of distributors in the United States and Canada was established.

Deutz-powered air-cooled engine are well-suited for many applications since they cannot freeze or boil over during normal operation.

Deutz also manufactures oil-cooled engines. These can provide the same power as other engine designs, but in a smaller package, since they do not require the additional space to house a radiator. Deutz also makes engines with a tandem oil cooler/radiator configuration; these also do not require antifreeze or coolant agents.

Deutz also sells a line of economic liquid-cooled engines.

In 2007, the &quot;Deutz Power Systems&quot; division was sold to 3i, and Deutz AG now concentrates on producing and selling compact engines under the Deutz brand only. They focus on manufacturing engines only for the customer, without competing for the entire piece of finished machinery.

On October 1 2008, the former &quot;Deutz Power Systems&quot; division received a new, old, name MWM (Motoren Werke Mannheim AG). Karl Benz established the company in 1871. After splitting the engine business from Benz AG, it became Motoren-Werke Mannheim AG. Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG took over in 1985, later becoming Deutz AG. After spinning off Deutz Power Systems, the company has made a full circle back to MWM.

In 2012, SAME Deutz-Fahr sold 22 million shares, the majority of its holding in Deutz AG, to Volvo, making of it the largest shareholder at just over 25%. SAME Deutz-Fahr retained 8.4% equity in the company.

In 2017, Deutz acquired Torqeedo GmbH, specialist for integrated electric and hybrid drives for boats. Volvo sold all of its ownership stakes in Deutz in the same year.

=== Locomotive and wagon construction (1892-1970) ===
Until the 1950s, only small locomotives (e.g. light rail locomotives) were produced. After the interest group formed in 1953 with the United Westdeutsche Waggonfabriken AG (Westwaggon) and their final takeover in 1959, KHD was also able to build large bogie diesel locomotives.

<text>Józef Brandt (1841 in Szczebrzeszyn – 1915 in Radom) was a Polish painter best known for his paintings of battles in Polish history.

==Life==
Brandt studied in Warsaw in the school of J.N. Leszczynski and at the Noblemen&#x27;s Institute. In 1858 he left for Paris to study at the Ecole centrale Paris but was persuaded by Juliusz Kossak to abandon engineering in favor of painting. He studied as a painter in Munich under Franz Adam and Karl Piloty and then opened his own studio.

His paintings mostly study 17th-century military life, though he has also made some studies of Polish peasant life.

In 1893, Brandt was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic, and in 1898, he became the recipient of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art.

==Centre of Polish Sculpture==
Brandt&#x27;s 19th century manor house in Orońsko together with surrounding park serves today as the Centre of Polish Sculpture.

<doc id="1291462" wikidata="Q1752695" url="?curid=1291462" title="Necrophagia">
<text>Necrophagia ( ) was an American death metal band formed in Wellsville, Ohio in 1983. The band is credited as one of the inaugural groups within the death metal genre, along with Possessed and Death.

==History==

===Early years (1983–1997)===
Necrophagia was formed by Frank &quot;Killjoy&quot; Pucci in 1983. The band name is derived from the act of cannibalizing, or eating a corpse. The word is a combination of the Greek words &#x27; (corpse), and &#x27; (to eat). Necrophagia was a popular group in the underground extreme metal &quot;tape trading&quot; scene. Their first full-length album, &quot;Season of the Dead&quot;, was recorded and released in 1987. The band split up sometime after the album&#x27;s release. In 1990, an album named &quot;Ready for Death&quot; (recorded in 1986) was bootlegged by the label Embalming Records, and was given an official release of 500 on clear green vinyl when New Renaissance came to an agreement with Embalming Records. &quot;Ready for Death&quot; was later included as part of the &quot;A Legacy of Horror, Gore and Sickness&quot; compilation album in 2000.

===Phil Anselmo era (1997–2001)===
Killjoy befriended Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo, shortly after Necrophagia&#x27;s demise. Phil wrote and shared some music with Killjoy, which persuaded him to resurrect Necrophagia in 1997. Killjoy and Anselmo (who played guitar under the pseudonym Anton Crowley) were joined by Wayne Fabra on drums and Dustin Havnen on bass guitar. Necrophagia released &quot;Holocausto de la Morte&quot;, as well as the &quot;Black Blood Vomitorium&quot; EP, with the reformed line-up. Havnen was replaced by Jared Faulk in 2001. In addition, the group enlisted Gorelord leader Frediablo as second guitarist, and Opal Enthroned on keyboards. Necrophagia released the &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; EP in 2001, along with their first DVD, &quot;Through Eyes of the Dead&quot;. Anselmo, Opal and Fabra departed the band shortly after the release. In addition, the Housecore/Baphomet Records label founded by Killjoy and Anselmo was dissolved, due to extreme scheduling conflicts and previous commitments.

===Frediablo era (2002–2006)===
Killjoy and Frediablo remained with Necrophagia. In 2002, the band added Fug (Frediablo&#x27;s brother) on guitar, Iscariah (formerly of Immortal) on bass guitar, Titta Tanni (of Daemonia/New Goblin fame) on drums and Mirai Kawashima (of the Japanese avant-garde black metal band Sigh) on keyboards. Necrophagia released &quot;The Divine Art of Torture&quot;, &quot;Harvest Ritual Vol. 1&quot; and the &quot;Goblins Be Thine&quot; EP with the line-up. In addition, Necrophagia released their first live album &quot;Slit Wrists And Casket Rot&quot;, which was recorded during their &quot;Harvesting the Dead&quot; tour.

Frediablo left the band in early 2006 to concentrate on Gorelord. He was replaced by Undead Torment.

===Recent activity===
Necrophagia released &quot;Death Trip 69&quot; in May 2011. The album featured several guest appearances, including Casey Chaos from Amen, and former Mayhem vocalist Maniac. &quot;WhiteWorm Cathedral&quot; was released in October 2014. Necrophagia supported 1349 on their &quot;Chaos Raids North America&quot; tour in May and June 2015. 

On March 18, 2018, vocalist and founding member Killjoy died at the age of 51.

The band&#x27;s final studio album &quot;Moribundis Grim&quot; was released on May 10, 2024. It features Killjoy&#x27;s final recordings before his passing and is their sole album to feature guitarist Serge Streltsov.

<doc id="1291468" wikidata="Q143866" url="?curid=1291468" title="Fête de la Fédération">
<text>The (; ) was a massive holiday festival held throughout France in 1790 in honour of the French Revolution, celebrating the Revolution itself, as well as national unity.

It commemorated the revolution and events of 1789 which had culminated in a new form of national government, a constitutional monarchy led by a representative Assembly.

The inaugural &quot;fête&quot; of 1790 was set for 14 July, to coincide with the first anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, although that is not what was celebrated. At this relatively calm stage of the Revolution, many people considered France&#x27;s period of political struggle to be over. This thinking was encouraged by the constitutional monarchist &quot;Monarchiens&quot;. The first &quot;fête&quot; was designed with a role for King Louis XVI that would respect and maintain his royal status, while emphasizing his new role as the citizen king of the incipient French liberal constitutional monarchy. The occasion passed peacefully and provided a powerful, but illusory, image of celebrating national unity after the divisive events of 1789–1790.

==Background==
After the initial revolutionary events of 1789, France&#x27;s &quot;ancien régime&quot; had shifted into a new paradigm of constitutional monarchy. By the end of 1789, towns and villages throughout France began to join together as &quot;fédérations&quot;, fraternal associations which commemorated and promoted the new political structure. 

A common theme among them was a wish for a nationwide expression of unity, a &quot;fête&quot; to honour the Revolution. Plans were set for simultaneous celebrations in July 1790 all over the nation, but the &quot;fête&quot; in Paris would be the most prominent by far. It would feature the King, the royal family, and all the deputies of the National Constituent Assembly, with thousands of other citizens predicted to arrive from all corners of France.

== Preparation ==

The event took place on the Champ de Mars, which was at the time far outside Paris. The vast stadium had been financed by the National Assembly, and completed in time only with the help of thousands of volunteer laborers from the Paris region. During these &quot;Wheelbarrow Days&quot;(&quot;journée des brouettes&quot;), the festival workers popularised a new song that would become an enduring anthem of France, &quot;Ah! ça ira&quot;.

Enormous earthen stands for spectators were built on each side of the field, with a seating capacity estimated at 100,000. The Seine was crossed by a bridge of boats leading to an altar where oaths were to be sworn. The new military school was used to harbour members of the National Assembly and their families. At one end of the field, a huge tent was the king&#x27;s step, and at the other end, a triumphal arch was built. At the centre of the field was an altar for the mass.

== Official celebration ==
The feast began as early as four in the morning, under a strong rain which lasted the whole day. The &quot;Journal de Paris&quot; had predicted &quot;frequent downpours&quot;.

Fourteen thousand &quot;fédérés&quot; came from the provinces, every single National Guard unit having sent two men out of every hundred. They were ranged under eighty-three banners, according to their &quot;département&quot;. They were brought to the place where the Bastille once stood, and went through Saint-Antoine, Saint-Denis and Saint-Honoré streets before crossing the temporary bridge and arriving at the Champ de Mars.
A mass was celebrated by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, bishop of Autun. At this time, the first French Constitution was not yet completed, and it would not be officially ratified until September 1791. But the gist of it was understood by everyone, and no one was willing to wait. Lafayette led the President of the National Assembly and all the deputies in a solemn oath to the coming Constitution:

Afterwards, Louis XVI took a similar vow: &quot;I, King of the French, swear to use the power given to me by the constitutional act of the State, to maintain the Constitution as decreed by the National Assembly and accepted by myself.&quot; The title &quot;King of the French&quot;, used here for the first time instead of &quot;King of France (and Navarre)&quot;, was an innovation intended to inaugurate a popular monarchy which linked the monarch&#x27;s title to the &quot;people&quot; rather than the &quot;territory&quot; of France. The Queen Marie Antoinette then rose and showed the Dauphin, future Louis XVII, saying: &quot;This is my son, who, like me, joins in the same sentiments.&quot;

The festival organisers welcomed delegations from countries around the world, including the recently established United States. John Paul Jones, Thomas Paine and other Americans unfurled their Stars and Stripes at the Champ de Mars, the first instance of the flag being flown outside of the United States.

== Popular feast ==
After the end of the official celebration, the day ended in a huge popular feast. It was also a symbol of the reunification of the Three Estates, after the heated Estates-General of 1789, with the Bishop (First Estate) and the King (Second Estate) blessing the people (Third Estate). In the gardens of the Château de La Muette, a meal was offered to more than 20,000 participants, followed by much singing, dancing, and drinking. The feast ended on 18 July.

== Trivia ==
* The &quot;Chant du 14 juillet&quot;, written by Marie-Joseph Chénier and François-Joseph Gossec, was sung in the &quot;Écoles Normales&quot; until the Second World War.
* Jean Claude Jacob, a serf from the Jura Mountains, supposedly 120 years old, was brought from his native place to figure as &quot;Dean of the Human Race&quot;.

<doc id="1291471" wikidata="Q252307" url="?curid=1291471" title="Guy Boothby">
<text>Guy Newell Boothby (13 October 1867 – 26 February 1905) was a prolific Australian novelist and writer, noted for sensational fiction in variety magazines around the end of the nineteenth century. He lived mainly in England. He is best known for such works as the Dr Nikola series, about an occultist criminal mastermind who is a Victorian forerunner to Fu Manchu, and &quot;Pharos, the Egyptian&quot;, a tale of Gothic Egypt, mummies&#x27; curses and supernatural revenge. Rudyard Kipling was his friend and mentor, and his books were remembered with affection by George Orwell.

==Biography==
Boothby was born in Adelaide to a prominent family in the recently established British colony of South Australia. His father was Thomas Wilde Boothby, who for a time was a member of the South Australian Legislative Assembly, three of his uncles were senior colonial administrators, and his grandfather was Benjamin Boothby (1803–1868), controversial judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia from 1853 to 1867. When Boothby was aged approximately seven his English-born mother, whom he held in great regard, separated from his father and returned with her children to England. There he received a traditional English grammar school education at Salisbury, Lord Weymouth&#x27;s Grammar (now Warminster School) and Christ&#x27;s Hospital, London.

Following this, Boothby returned alone to South Australia at 16, where, in his turn, he entered the colonial administration as private secretary to the mayor of Adelaide, Lewis Cohen, but was &quot;not contented&quot; with the work. Despite Boothby&#x27;s family tradition of colonial service, his natural inclinations ran more to the creative than to the administrative and he was not satisfied with his limited role as a provincial colonial servant. In 1890, aged 23, Boothby wrote the libretto for &quot;Sylvia&quot;, a comic opera, published and produced at Adelaide in December 1890, and in 1891 his second show, &quot;The Jonquil: an Opera&quot;, appeared. He also wrote and performed in an operetta, &quot;Dimple&#x27;s Lovers&quot;, for Adelaide&#x27;s Garrick Club theatre group. The music in each case was written by Cecil James Sharp. His early literary ventures were directed at the theatre, but his ambition was not appeased by the lukewarm response his melodramas received in Adelaide. When severe economic collapse hit most of the Australian colonies in the early 1890s, he followed the well-beaten path to London in December 1891.

Boothby, however, was thwarted in his first bid for recognition as lack of funds forced him to disembark en route in Colombo, Sri Lanka and begin making his way homewards through South East Asia. According to family legend, the dire poverty he faced on this journey led him to accept any kind of work he could get: &#x27;This meant working before the mast, stoking in ocean tramps, attending in a Chinese opium den in Singapore, digging in the Burmah Ruby fields, acting, prize fighting, cow punching...&#x27; This was followed by a brief sojourn on Thursday Island, a Melanesian island in the Torres Strait group recently annexed by the Queensland colony, where he worked as a diver in the lucrative pearl trade; and finally by an arduous journey overland across the Australian continent home to Adelaide. While Depasquale, author of the only Boothby biography, warns that this account of his travels may be somewhat glamorous, Boothby certainly travelled extensively in South East Asia, Melanesia and Australia at this period, collecting a stock of colonial anecdotes and experiences that were to influence much of his later writing.

Approximately two years later, Boothby finally reached London and succeeded in having an account of his peregrinations, &quot;On the Wallaby, or Through the East and Across Australia&quot;, published in 1894. The travelogue met with reasonable success, which was matched later that year by Boothby&#x27;s first novel, &quot;In Strange Company&quot;. A novel of adventure set variously in England, Australia, the South Seas and South America, &quot;In Strange Company&quot; established a pattern that was to characterise the succeeding Boothby oeuvre – the use of exotic, international and particularly Australasian locales that frequently function as an end in themselves superfluous to the requirements of plot. By October 1895, Boothby had completed three further novels, including &quot;A Bid for Fortune&quot;, the first Dr Nikola novel which catapulted Boothby to wide acclaim. Of the two other novels Boothby wrote in 1895 &quot;A Lost Endeavour&quot; was set on Thursday Island and &quot;The Marriage of Esther&quot; ranged across several Torres Strait Islands. Boothby continued to produce fiction at a ferocious rate, producing up to six novels a year across the range of genres prevalent at the &quot;fin de siècle&quot;, and is credited with producing over 53 novels in total, not to mention dozens of short stories and plays.

==Death==
Boothby died at his home, aged 38 years, in Boscombe, near Bournemouth, from complications arising from influenza on 26 February 1905. His grave is in the town&#x27;s Wimborne Road Cemetery.

==Writing==
Some of Boothby&#x27;s earlier works relate to stories of Australian life, but later he turned to genre fiction, including crime fiction, imperial romance, science fiction and Gothic horror. Boothby&#x27;s oeuvre is pervaded by an array of intriguing and subversive villains whose larger than life characters eclipse the unremarkable English protagonists. They range from the classic supernatural fiends of &quot;fin-de-siècle gothic&quot;, to deformed freaks (a particular penchant of Boothby&#x27;s), to sophisticated international master criminals that anticipate the adversaries of Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond character. In their depiction of the international master criminal and the revenge of the undead ancient Egyptian, Boothby&#x27;s novels were influential in establishing two key tropes of the cinematic age, which persist long after the novels themselves have faded into obscurity.

==The Dr Nikola Series==

Boothby was once well known for his series of novels about &quot;Doctor Nikola&quot;, an occultist anti-hero seeking immortality and world domination. The adventures of Nikola were launched with the first episode of &quot;&quot; which was serialised in &quot;The Windsor Magazine&quot; (a rival to &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;). Nikola is described as dressing in &quot;faultless evening dress, slender, having dark peculiar eyes and dark hair, and white toad-coloured skin.&quot; He lives in a bungalow on the Rue de Lafayette in Shanghai. Stanley L. Wood often illustrated the Nikola stories and his portraits depict Dr Nikola in white cravat and fur coat, with his perennial companion, the black cat Apollyon (named after a dark angel) – huge, baleful, gleaming-eyed – perched on Nikola&#x27;s shoulder. Nikola – cosmopolitan, cultivated, universally feared – is highly intelligent but unscrupulous.

John Clute writes that &quot;The heart of the series is devoted to the Doctor&#x27;s convoluted search for a Tibetan process that will resuscitate the dead and ensure immortality in the living, and there are some hints that – unhampered by compunctions, armed with psi powers and blessed with a powerful experimental intellect – he may have reached his goal.&quot;

Dr Nikola starred in a play &quot;The Adventures of Dr. Nikola&quot; by Ben Landeck and Oswald Brand, which ran briefly in London in 1902.

==Other novels==
In &quot;A Prince of Swindlers&quot; he created the character of Simon Carne, a gentleman thief, in the Raffles mould, with an alter ego as the eccentric detective Klimo. Carne first appeared in &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1897, predating Raffles by two years.

&quot;Pharos the Egyptian&quot; (1899) is a thriller with romance and some supernaturalism in which a very sinister old man, Pharos, proves to be Ptahmes, a mummy who has survived through the centuries with full magical powers.

&quot;The Curse of the Snake&quot; (1902) is referred to by Brian Stableford as the most interesting of Boothby&#x27;s novels. However, Stableford states that Boothby &quot;very obviously made up his novel plots as he went along and that therefore this novel &quot;concludes with a woefully inadequate explanation of its marvelously creepy opening sequence.&quot;

==Ghost stories==
Boothby wrote a number of ghost stories, mainly from his collections &quot;Uncle Joe&#x27;s Legacy and Other Stories&quot; (1902) and &quot;The Lady on the Island&quot; (1904). Amongst the better known of these are &quot;The Black Lady of Brin Tor&quot;, &quot;A Strange Goldfield&quot;, &quot;The Lady on the Island&quot; and &quot;Remorseless Vengeance.&quot; These have been reprinted in horror anthologies edited variously by Richard Dalby, Hugh Lamb, Leigh Blackmore and James Doig.

<doc id="1291473" wikidata="Q783891" url="?curid=1291473" title="Delahaye">
<text>Delahaye was a family-owned automobile manufacturing company, founded by Émile Delahaye in 1894 in Tours, France. Manufacturing was moved to Paris following incorporation in 1898 with two marriage-related brothers-in-law, George Morane and Leon Desmarais, as Emile Delahaye&#x27;s equal partners. The company built a low volume line of limited production luxury cars with coachbuilt bodies; trucks; utility and commercial vehicles; buses; and fire-trucks. Delahaye made a number of technical innovations, particular in its early years. After establishing a racing department in 1932, the company came to prominence in France in the mid-to-late 1930s, first with the International record-breaking Type 138; then, the Type 135 that famously evolved into the special short-wheelbase sports-racing Type 135CS; followed by the V12 types 145 and 155 racecars. Many races were won, and records set. The company faced setbacks due to the Second World War, and was taken over by amalgamation with arch competitor Hotchkiss in 1954. Both were absorbed by the large Brandt manufacturing organization, within months, with automotive products ended. Delahaye closed forever at the end of 1954, taking Delage along with it.

==History==
===Formative years===
Engineer Émile Delahaye began experimenting with belt-driven cars in 1894, while he was manager of the Brethon Foundry and Machine-works in Tours, France. These experiments encouraged him to acquire the foundry and machine-works, so that Monsieur Brethon could retire. Emile soon entered his automobiles in the 1896 Paris–Marseille–Paris race, and the 1897 Paris–Dieppe race, followed in 1898 by the Marseilles–Nice rally, the Course de Périgeux, and the Paris–Amsterdam–Paris race.
Delahaye&#x27;s automotive company was incorporated in 1898 with investors George Morane – who had driven one of Delahaye&#x27;s cars in the Marseilles–Nice rally – and Morane&#x27;s brother-in-law Leon Desmarais. The company moved its manufacturing from Tours to Paris, to a former hydraulic machinery plant owned by the Morane family. Charles Weiffenbach was made operations manager. The company initially produced three models at this location: the 1.4 litre single-cylinder Type 0, and the twin-cylinder and Type 2. All three had bicycle-style tiller steering, rear-mounted water-cooled engines, automatic valves, surface carburetors, and trembler coil ignition; drive was a combination of belt and chain, with three forward speeds and one reverse.
Desmarais and Morane took control of the company when Émile Delahaye retired in 1901; Weiffenbach took over from them in 1906. The company ceased its participation in racing after Delahaye&#x27;s death in 1905. Weiffenbach had no interest in racing, and focused on production of practical motorized automotive chassis, heavy commercial vehicles, and early firetrucks for the French government.

By 1904, about 850 automobiles had been built. The company introduced its first production four-cylinder in 1903 and shaft-drive transmissions in 1907. Delahaye&#x27;s chief design-engineer Amédée Varlet invented and pioneered the V6 engine in the 1911 Type 44. Varlet also designed the Delahaye Titan marine engine, an enormous cast-iron multi-valve twin-cam four-cylinder engine that was fitted into purpose-built speedboat &quot;La Dubonnet&quot;, which briefly held the world speed record on water.

===Licensing and collaborations===
German manufacturer Protos began licensed production of Delahaye models in 1907, while in 1909, H. M. Hobson began importing Delahaye vehicles to Britain. US manufacturer White pirated the Delahaye design; the First World War interrupted efforts to recover damages. By the end of the war, Delahaye&#x27;s major income was from manufacturing trucks.

Following the war, Delahaye attempted, in 1927, to increase profits by adopting a modest form of assembly-line production, in a tripartite agreement with FAR Tractor Company and Chenard &amp; Walcker automakers, and Rosengart, an entry-level manufacturer of small family cars. However, the range of vehicles undertaken to produce was excessively extensive, too diverse, and totally devoid of practical standardization. The collaboration did not last long as shrinking sales volume threatened the company&#x27;s survival. By 1931, the triumvirate had disintegrated. It has been alleged that Weiffenbach met with his friend and competitor Ettore Bugatti, to seek his opinion on turning Delahaye around. In 1932, Desmarais&#x27;s widow and majority shareholder, Madame Leon Desmarais, instructed Weiffenbach to develop a new, higher quality, and considerably sportier automotive-chassis line, with an appealingly distinctive appearance, improved horsepower, better handling, and a higher price-point. Delahaye was repositioned to appeal to a wealthier, younger, more sporting oriented customer base. Varlet was instructed to establish both the new drawing office, and the racing department, neither of which Delahaye ever had before. Weiffenbach hired Jean François, as Varlet&#x27;s assistant, and the company&#x27;s designer and chief engineer. Delahaye had escaped near disaster, to arise with virtually immediate success, in the new Type 134, followed almost immediately by the International speed record setting Type 138, and then the model that made Delahaye deservedly famous: the Type 135.

===Return to racing===
In 1934, Delahaye set eighteen class records at Montlhéry, in a specially-prepared, stripped and streamlined 18 Sport. The company also introduced the 134N, a 12cv car with a 2.15-litre four-cylinder engine, and the 18cv Type 138, powered by a 3.2-litre six-cylinder engine – both developed from their successful truck engines. In 1935, success in the Alpine Trial led to the introduction of the sporting Type 135 &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot;. By the end of 1935, Delahaye had won eighteen minor French sports car events and a number of hill-climbs, and came fifth at Le Mans. In 1936, Delahaye ran four cars (based on the Type 135) in the Ulster TT, placing second to Bugatti, and entered four at the Belgian 24 Hours, finishing 2-3-4-5 behind an Alfa Romeo. Delahaye was able to leverage their racing success to acquire automaker Delage in 1935.
American heiress Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell paid the developmental costs for short &quot;Competition Court&quot; 2.70-metre-wheelbase Type 135 cars for rallying and racing. She purchased 12 of these, reserving half for her Ecurie Bleue amateur racing team.

In 1937, René Le Bègue and Julio Quinlin won the Monte Carlo Rally driving a Delahaye. Delahaye also ran first and second at Le Mans. Against the German government-sponsored juggernauts Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, Delahaye entered the Type 145, powered by a complicated -litre V12. Called the &quot;Million Franc Delahaye&quot; after a victory in the Million Franc Race, the initial Type 145 was driven by René Dreyfus to an average speed over at Montlhéry in 1937, earning a government prize. Dreyfus also scored a victory in the Ecurie Bleu Type 145 at Pau in 1938, using the model&#x27;s fuel economy to beat the more powerful Mercedes-Benz W154. Another Type 145 finished third in the same race.

These victories combined with French patriotism ensured demand for Delahaye cars up until the German occupation of France during World War II. In early 1940, 100 Type 134N and Type 168 chassis were built and bodied by Renault as military cars under contract for the French army. The French government had ordered all private automobile production to cease in June 1939, but small numbers of cars continued to be built for the occupying German forces until at least 1942.

In 1951, a French military team with Captain Monnier and Colonel Henri Debrus were part of the victorious crew that won the first Algiers-Cape Town Rally with a Delahaye pick-up.

===Post-war decline===
After World War II, French luxury car makers struggled under the depressed economy. General Pons&#x27;s five-year reconstruction program (the Pons Plan) allocated the majority of its vehicles for export, and installed an increasingly punitive tax regime aimed at luxurious non-essential products, including cars with engines larger than . In 1947, 88% of Delahaye production was exported, primarily to French colonies in Asia and Africa. Delahaye&#x27;s meagre production of 573 cars in 1948 (compared to 34,164 by market-leader Citroën), was unsustainably low.

The new face of the postwar Delahaye was styled in-house by industrial designer Philippe Charbonneaux. Production of the outdated pre-war Type 135 and 148L was resumed in 1946, to restart cash flow and because the Type 175 and its two longer-wheelbased versions were not ready for introduction. The Type 175 was very modern when it had been envisioned in 1938 but its production was delayed until 1948 due to the war, post-war shortages, and the death of its designer.

With a license agreement in place and no viable alternatives, Delahaye proceeded with production of the Type 175. However, suspension components underwent catastrophic failure, and Delahaye was obliged to buy back a number of its vehicles to avoid litigation. The risk of negative publicity was so great that the company kept no records of these events. The affair could not be effectively contained and resulted in disinterest among prospective buyers. The Type 175, 178 and 180 models were unable to generate enough sales to recover development and production costs. Their production was discontinued in mid-1951.

Until early 1951, continuing demand from the French army for the company&#x27;s light reconnaissance vehicles (VLR) enabled the company to operate. Small but steady demand for the trucks allowed the business to remain solvent.

A one-ton capacity light truck (later sharing its 3.5-litre six-cylinder overhead-valve engine with the company&#x27;s Type 235 luxury cars) made its debut at the 1949 Paris Motor Show as the Type 171. During the next twelve months the Type 171 spawned several brake-bodied versions, including ambulance and 9-seater &quot;familiale&quot; variants. The vehicle was intended for use in France&#x27;s African colonies, having large wheels and high ground clearance, and was also exported to Brazil. By 1952, thirty Type 171s were produced per month.
Delahaye&#x27;s last entirely new model, a 2-litre Jeep-like vehicle known as Delahaye VLR (Véhicule Léger de Reconnaissance Delahaye) was released in 1951. The French army believed that this vehicle offered a number of advantages over the traditional American-built Jeep of the period. During 1953, the company built 1,847 VLRs, as well as 537 &quot;special&quot; military vehicles. In that year no more than 36 Delahaye or Delage-branded passenger cars were registered.

In 1953, the Type 235 was introduced. Fernand Lecour, working with a small group of enthusiastic factory employees, convinced Weiffenbach to introduce an updated version of the Type 135, fitted with hydraulic instead of mechanical brakes, and a triple Solex carbureted version of the 3.6-litre Type 135 engine, which produced . This power was roughly equal to that of the previous series. Only 84 examples of the Type 235 were built.

Delahaye&#x27;s competitor, Hotchkiss, negotiated a licensing agreement with Kaiser-Willys Motors, and obtained sanction to manufacture its Willys MB &#x27;Jeep&#x27; in France. The French army began to appreciate the simpler machine, available at a much lower price, and cancelled the contract for the more sophisticated Delahaye VLR. In August 1953, the company laid off more than 200 employees. A merger was discussed with Hotchkiss, which was facing similar problems. On 19 March 1954, an agreement was signed by Delahaye president Pierre Peigney and Hotchkiss president Paul Richard. Less than three months later, on 9 June, Delahaye shareholders accepted a takeover of Delahaye by Hotchkiss, after which Hotchkiss promptly shut down Delahaye car production. By the end of 1954, after a brief period selling trucks with the Hotchkiss-Delahaye nameplate, the combined firm was itself taken over by Brandt. By 1956, the brands Delahaye, Delage, and Hotchkiss were no longer in use.

==Ownership and administration==

From its incorporation, Delahaye remained a private, entirely family-owned company, until it closed its doors for the last time, on December 31, 1954.

Emile Delahaye, a successful Tours foundry and machine-works owner, built his first car in 1894. By 1898, the demand required that he expand facilities and obtain investment capital. Emile Delahaye agreed to partner equally with coppersmith business owners and brothers-in-law, Leon Desmarais and George Morane. The arrangement was duly incorporated in 1898, and car assembly was moved to the vacant Paris factory owned by the incoming partners. When Delahaye retired in 1901, from failing health, he sold his shares to his partners, with Desmarais purchasing more, thus gaining a majority. As the Desmarais and Morane families were connected by marriage, Delahaye was a family-owned business, from 1901 until its takeover by Hotchkiss in 1954. Delahaye was the minority partner. The board of directors was composed of the shareholders, plus their appointed manager of operations, Charles Weiffenbach, as chief executive officer.

Emile Delahaye had been the company&#x27;s president, its sole engineer, and the administrator, until his retirement in 1901. In 1898, Delahaye hired Charles Weiffenbach as his managerial assistant; and, Amédée Varlet as the design-engineer. Both men were qualified mechanical engineers, with differing talents, and both stayed with the company for their entire working career. Weiffenbach became the operations manager in 1906, while Varlet focused on technical engineering and manufacturing advances. In 1932, 42-year-old Jean François was hired as chief design-engineer. Amadee Varlet was over eighty by then, and past his creative prime, but his earned respect caused him to be promoted to head up the new drawing office, and set up and manage the new racing department, assisted by much younger engineer Jean François.

Pierre Peigney, a family relative, was the president, but his was more a formal role, since it was Charles Weiffenbach who had been mandated by the partners to run the company, literally single-handedly.

This he did, including after orchestrating the merger in 1954 with Hotchkiss, a prime competitor. President Peigney signed for Delahaye, and president Richard signed for Hotchkiss. Neither company had the strength and resources to avoid being absorbed by the gigantic Brandt group of companies. Delahaye vanished into extinction in late 1954.

<text>Situational ethics or situation ethics takes into account &quot;only&quot; the particular context of an act when evaluating it ethically, rather than judging it only according to absolute moral standards. With the intent to have a fair basis for judgments or action, one looks to personal ideals of what is appropriate to guide them, rather than an unchanging universal code of conduct, such as Biblical law under divine command theory or the Kantian categorical imperative. Proponents of situational approaches to ethics include existentialist philosophers such as Sartre, de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty, Jaspers, and Heidegger.

Specifically Christian forms of situational ethics placing love above all particular principles or rules were proposed in the first half of the twentieth century by liberal theologians Rudolf Bultmann, John A. T. Robinson, and Joseph Fletcher. These theologians point specifically to &quot;agapē&quot;, or unconditional love, as the highest end. Other theologians who advocated situational ethics include Josef Fuchs, Reinhold Niebuhr, Karl Barth, Emil Brunner, and Paul Tillich. Tillich, for example, declared that &quot;Love is the ultimate law.&quot;

Fletcher, who became prominently associated with this approach in the English-speaking world due to his book (&quot;Situation Ethics&quot;), stated that &quot;all laws and rules and principles and ideals and norms, are only contingent, only valid if they happen to serve love&quot; in the particular situation, and thus may be broken or ignored if another course of action would achieve a more loving outcome. Fletcher has sometimes been identified as the founder of situation ethics, but he himself refers his readers to the active debate over the theme that preceded his own work.

==Ethical classification and origin of term==
Situational ethics is a form of consequentialism (though distinct from utilitarianism in that the latter&#x27;s aim is &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number&quot;) that focuses on creating the greatest amount of love. Situational ethics can also be classed under the ethical theory genre of &quot;proportionalism&quot; which says that &quot;It is never right to go against a principle unless there is a proportionate reason which would justify it.&quot; J. A. T. Robinson, a situational ethicist, considered the approach to be a form of ethical relativism.

There was an active debate in the mid-twentieth century around situational ethics, which was being promoted by a number of primarily Protestant theologians. The English term &quot;situation ethics&quot; was taken from the German &quot;Situationsethik&quot;. It is unclear who first coined the term either in German or in its English variant.

==Joseph Fletcher==
Fletcher proposed that in forming an ethical system based on love, he was best expressing the notion of &quot;love thy neighbor,&quot; which Jesus Christ taught in the Gospels of the New Testament of the Bible. Through situational ethics, Fletcher was attempting to find a &quot;middle road&quot; between legalistic and antinomian ethics. Fletcher developed his theory of situational ethics in his books: &quot;The Classic Treatment&quot; and &quot;Situation Ethics&quot;. Situational ethics is thus a teleological or consequential theory, in that it is primarily concerned with the outcome or consequences of an action; the &quot;end&quot;. Fletcher proposed that loving ends justify any means. Joseph Fletcher abandoned his theistic belief in his later life but never strayed away from his belief in situation ethics. 

Fletcher outlined his theory in four &quot;working principles&quot; and six &quot;fundamental principles&quot;.

===The four working principles===
The following are presuppositions Fletcher makes before setting out the situational ethics theory:

# Pragmatism: An action someone makes should be judged according to the love influenced in it, so the user must always ask: what is the most loving thing to do? For example, war may not to a situationist be considered the most &#x27;loving&#x27; thing and so many are quick to deem it as morally wrong.
# Relativism: Approaching every situation with a relative mindset and thus opposing legalistic approaches avoid words such as &#x27;never&#x27;, &#x27;complete&#x27; and &#x27;perfect&#x27;.
# Positivism: The most important choice of all in the teachings in 1 John 4:7–12 is &quot;let us love one another because love is from God&quot;.
# Personalism: Whereas the legalist thinks people should work to laws, the situational ethicist believes that laws benefit the people. This forces the user to ask &#x27;who is to be helped?&#x27; instead of &#x27;what is the law&#x27;, stressing the importance of people before laws.

===The six fundamental principles (propositions)===
; First proposition: Only one thing is intrinsically good; namely love: nothing else at all. &quot;Fletcher (1966, p. 56)&quot; an action is good only in so far as it brings about agape.
; Second proposition: The ruling norm of Christian decision is love: nothing else. &quot;Fletcher (1966, p. 69)&quot; the most important commandment is to love God and &quot;love thy neighbour&quot;.
; Third proposition: Love and Justice are the same, for justice is love distributed, nothing else. &quot;Fletcher (1966, p. 87)&quot; asks that one must always have an eye on the intention of an action.
:Justice is Christian love using its head, calculating its duties, obligations, opportunities, resources... Justice is love coping with situations where distribution is called for. &quot;Fletcher (1966, p. 95)&quot;
; Fourth proposition: Love wills the neighbour&#x27;s good, whether we like him or not. &quot;Fletcher (1966, p. 103)&quot; illustrates that agape is not an emotion as it sometimes involves sacrifice, we must thus love not expecting anything in return.
; Fifth proposition: Only the end justifies the means, nothing else. Actions only acquire moral status as a means to an end; for Fletcher, the end must be the most loving result. When measuring a situation, one must consider the desired end, the means available, the motive for acting and the foreseeable consequences. &quot; Fletcher (1966, p. 120)&quot; thus, you must recognise that anything may be done if it brings about the most loving outcome.
; Sixth proposition: Love&#x27;s decisions are made situationally, not prescriptively. &quot;Fletcher (1966, p. 134) - nothing is inherently right or wrong, everything should be done according to the most loving thing specific to the situation.&quot;

===Examples===
Fletcher proposed various examples of situations in which the established moral laws might need to be put on hold in order to achieve the greater amount of love. These were based upon real situations.

====Himself Might his Quietus Make====
Pragmatism, positivism, relativism and personalism are the four working principles which mean to be reasonably sure the act you take will work and provide the most loving consequence, accepting Situational Ethics as a matter of faith and not reason, each situation must be relative to love and bring about the most loving result and finally the needs of people come first rather than a set of rules.

====Special Bombing Mission No. 13====
====Christian Cloak and Dagger====
These situations were criticised as being extreme. Joseph Fletcher agreed that they were, as general guidelines should apply in normal cases, with exceptions for extreme cases.

==Criticism==
Philosopher Mortimer J. Adler, in his autobiography, characterized situation ethics as a &quot;half-baked theory of conduct aired during the early sixties. It is morally wrong.&quot;

Some have argued that it is not a true Christian ethic, as it ignores absolute moral commands in its emphasis on the concept of agape.

<text>Morris William Travers, FRS (24 January 1872 – 25 August 1961) was an English chemist who worked with Sir William Ramsay in the discovery of xenon, neon and krypton. His work on several of the rare gases earned him the name &quot;Rare Gas Travers&quot; in scientific circles. He was the founding director of the Indian Institute of Science, prior to which he served as a professor of Chemistry at the University College, Bristol, predecessor institution of the University of Bristol, on the recommendations of Sir William Ramsay, former principal of the University College.

==Early life==
Travers was born in Kensington, London, the son of William Travers MD, FRCS (1838-1906), an early pioneer of aseptic surgical techniques. His mother was Anne Pocock. Travers went to school at Ramsgate, Woking and Blundell&#x27;s School.

==Career==
He then went to University College, where he began to work with Sir William Ramsay. Travers helped Ramsay to determine the properties of the newly discovered gases argon and helium. They also heated minerals and meteorites in the search for further gases, but found none. Then in 1898 they obtained a large quantity of liquid air and subjected it to fractional distillation. Spectral analysis of the least volatile fraction revealed the presence of krypton. They examined the argon fraction for a constituent of lower boiling point, and discovered neon. Finally xenon, occurring as an even less volatile companion to krypton, was identified spectroscopically. He knew the entire research story and wrote the biography of Sir William Ramsay in 1956 &quot;A life of Sir William Ramsay, K.C.B., F.R.S.&quot;

In 1904 he became a professor at University College. In May 1904 he was selected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1901-1902 Ramsay had been asked to advise the Indian government on the founding of a science institute and the institute was established in Bangalore with the help of the Government of Mysore and JN Tata. Ramsay suggested Travers as a possible director for this institute and in 1906, Travers was appointed as the director of the new Indian Institute of Science. The aim was to build the institute along the lines of the Imperial College of Science and Technology but Travers had conflicts with the Tata family especially in the interpretation of clauses in JN Tata&#x27;s will. The institute was started in June 1911 with four departments: General, Organic, and Applied Chemistry and Electrical Engineering.

He returned to Britain at the outbreak of World War I and directed the manufacture of glass at Duroglass Limited. In 1920 he started a company with F W Clark called Travers and Clark Ltd. which was involved with high-temperature furnaces and fuel technology, including the gasification of coal. In 1927 he went back to Bristol as Honorary Professor in Applied Chemistry.

Travers continued his researches in cryogenics and made the first accurate temperature measurements of liquid gases. He also helped to build several experimental liquid air plants in Europe. He died in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

<text>Alfred Shaw (29 August 1842 – 16 January 1907) was a Victorian cricketer and rugby footballer, who bowled the first ball in Test cricket and was the first to take five wickets in a Test innings (5/35). He made two trips to North America and four to Australia, captaining the English cricket team in four Test matches on the all-professional tour of Australia in 1881/82, where his side lost and drew two each. He was also, along with James Lillywhite and Arthur Shrewsbury, co-promoter of the tour. He also organised the first British Isles rugby tour to Australasia in 1888.

==Career==
Shaw was one of the few cricketers of his time whose Christian name was used more frequently than his initials. Standing only 5&#x27;6½&quot; tall, he put on copious weight near the end of his career, when his naturally corpulent build was dramatically accentuated. It is unfortunate, therefore, that most photographs of him were taken so late in his cricketing life. A man of droopy aspect, bushed eyes, some classically Victorian facial hair and a belt nearer his breast than his substantial waist, he did not look the part of the era&#x27;s finest medium-pacer, but there were few who questioned his credentials.

Shaw&#x27;s first-class career extended from 1864 to 1897, and most of his matches were for Nottinghamshire. He had the unusual distinction for a professional of frequently captaining that county, and this was vindicated when he took Notts to four successive Championships from 1883 to 1886. He was a natural leader with a powerful persona, but his connection with Notts all but ended after that last triumph. As his team-mates observed, the county&#x27;s team went into rapid decline upon his departure.

Sometime during Shaw&#x27;s early career, he suggested that the creases should be made by whitewash and this was gradually adopted through the 1870s. The origin of creases is uncertain, but they were in use at the beginning of the 18th century when they were created by scratching, the popping crease being 46 inches in front of the wicket at each end of the pitch. In the course of time, the scratches became cuts which were an inch deep and an inch wide. The cut was in use until the second half of the 19th century when whitewashing replaced it.

A fervent champion of the professional cricketer&#x27;s rights, Shaw did a lot of work in support of his contemporaries. He declined to tour with WG Grace in 1873/74 because the professionals in the squad were to be afforded only second-class facilities. In 1881, he led a strike of Notts professionals, demanding a formal contract of employment to guarantee an automatic benefit at the end of an agreed playing period. The high-handed Nottinghamshire committee thought this absolute anarchy and, apparently justified in its feeling that an amateur skipper was the way to go, dropped every member of the offending faction from the side. There was eventually a reconciliation, however, and Shaw took on the captaincy once more.

He was a remarkably accurate bowler, sending down more overs than he conceded runs in his entire career. A maiden over was more easily bowled then than it is now, as it comprised only four deliveries, but Shaw&#x27;s unparalleled consistency in this regard scarcely dropped off when the five-ball over was launched in 1889. Nearly two-thirds of all the overs that he bowled were runless.

Although he might by today&#x27;s terms be called a seamer, back then Shaw was fundamentally a length bowler, holding a line on or just outside the off-stump: certainly, he often employed the off-theory, with as many as eight fielders patrolling the offside. His run-up was made up of six rapid, economical steps, but, according to the man himself, &quot;I really used to bowl faster than people thought I did, and I could make the ball break both ways, but not much. In my opinion, length and variation of pace constitute the secret of successful bowling.&quot; However, although he was regarded almost universally as &quot;the high priest of length&quot;, he and Ted Peate together poured scorn all over suggestions that they were capable of &quot;hitting the spot&quot; with nearly every delivery (as was the common perception).

Shaw&#x27;s first-class bowling average is, by a quite substantial margin, the lowest of any bowler to have taken 2,000 or more wickets, but must be remembered that the pitches of the nineteenth century (particularly those at the start of his career) were far more bowler-friendly than they later became and are today. Still, this did not stop WG Grace from asserting that, between 1870 and 1880, Shaw was &quot;perhaps the best bowler in England&quot;. Certainly, he was supreme among slow bowlers.

For many years he was on the MCC groundstaff. In 1874, he took all ten wickets for the club in a first-class innings. In 1875 (against the MCC this time), he returned bowling figures of seven for seven off 41.2 overs, 36 of them maidens.

At the end of that 1876 season, Shaw went to Australia with James Lillywhite Junior&#x27;s side. He is famous for having bowled the first-ever delivery in Test Match cricket (unscored off, of course) to Charles Bannerman, who went on to score 165. On his debut, he took five wickets in the second innings. As a batsman, he became the first Test cricketer to be stumped; this was achieved by Jack Blackham off the bowling of Tom Kendall. Shaw played in seven of the first eight Test Matches, missing out in 1882 because, according to a 1902 interview with Allan Steel, &quot;he was not bowling quite at his best&quot;. Some, though, felt that his presence in the side that year might have turned the tide England&#x27;s way and ruled out the birth of The Ashes. As it was, he never played another Test Match and thus finished his career at the highest level with twelve wickets at an uncharacteristically large average of 23.75.

Shaw helped fellow cricketers Andrew Stoddart and Arthur Shrewsbury to organise what became recognised as the first British Lions rugby union tour of Australia and New Zealand 1888/89. The team played 55 matches, winning 27 of 35 rugby union games and 6 out of 18 matches played under Australian rules.

After Shaw&#x27;s first retirement, he became a renowned umpire, but perhaps his greatest playing achievements were still ahead of him. Along with his cricketing engagements under cricket-mad Arthur Stanley, 5th Baron Sheffield, he was employed to coach young Sussex cricketers, working part-time as a cricket coach at Ardingly College. It did not go unnoticed that Shaw was still far better than most of the county&#x27;s regular bowlers, thus, at the age of 52, Shaw returned to county cricket.

In 1894, he bowled 422 overs for his new county, conceding just 516 runs and capturing 41 wickets. The following year, at Trent Bridge (when it was so cold that KS Ranjitsinhji kept his hands in his pockets and fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.

<text>The State Anthem of the Kirghiz SSR was the regional anthem of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the anthem has since been replaced by the State Anthem of the Kyrgyz Republic.

==History==
The music was composed by Vladimir Vlasov, Abdylas Maldybaev and Vladimir Fere, and the lyrics were written by Kubanychbek Malikov, Tulgebai Sydykbekov, Mukanbet Toktobaev, and Aaly Tokombaev.

The anthem was used between 1946 and 1992. During de-Stalinisation in the 1950s, the lyrics were changed to remove references to Stalin. When Kyrgyzstan became independent on 31 August 1991, lyrics were removed and only the melody of the Kirghiz SSR remained in use for a short period of time. On 18 December 1992, a new anthem was officially adopted by the Supreme Council of Kyrgyzstan.

<text>Helen Maria Williams (17 June 1759 – 15 December 1827) was a British novelist, poet, and translator of French-language works. A religious dissenter, she was a supporter of abolitionism and of the ideals of the French Revolution; she was imprisoned in Paris during the Reign of Terror and spent much of the rest of her life in France. A controversial figure in her own time, the young Williams was favourably portrayed in a 1787 poem by William Wordsworth.

==Early years and education==
She was born on 17 June 1759 in London to a Scottish mother, Helen Hay, and a Welsh army officer father, Charles Williams. She had an older sister, Cecilia (baptized 1760), and an older half-sister Persis from her father&#x27;s first marriage (born 1743). Her father died in December 1762 when she was two. He had previously served as Secretary for Minorca when it was a British possession, and accumulated enough personal property that his widow and daughters lived comfortably on the income from his estate and pension. They moved to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Williams later described herself as coming from a &quot;family of women&quot;, growing up with only her mother and sisters. Williams described her upbringing in the preface to a 1786 book of poems as &quot;a confined education.&quot;

==Career==
In 1781, the Williams family moved to London, where Williams met Andrew Kippis, who would have great influence on her literary career and political views and brought her into contact with the leading London intellectuals of her time.

Her 1786 &quot;Poems&quot; touch on topics ranging from religion to a critique of Spanish colonial practices. She allied herself with the cult of feminine sensibility, deploying it politically in opposition to war (&quot;Ode on the Peace,&quot; a 1786 poem about Peru) and slavery (the abolitionist &quot;Poem on the Bill Lately Passed for Regulating the Slave Trade,&quot; 1788).

In the context of the Revolution Controversy, she came down on the side of the revolutionaries in her 1790 novel &quot;Julia&quot; and defied convention by travelling alone to revolutionary France, where she was hosted by Mme. Du Fossé, who had earlier, in London, given her lessons in French. Her &quot;Letters Written In France&quot; marked a turn from being primarily a writer of poetry to one of prose. She enthusiastically attended the Fête de la Fédération on the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille and returning briefly to London in 1791 was a staunch, though not completely uncritical, defender of the Revolution. Returning to France in July 1791, she published a poem &quot;A Farewell for two Years to England&quot;; in fact she briefly visited England again in 1792, but only to persuade her mother and her sisters, Cecilia and Persis, to join her in France just as the country was moving toward the more violent phases of its revolution.

After the September Massacres of 1792, she allied herself with the Girondists; as a &quot;saloniere&quot;, she also hosted Mary Wollstonecraft, Francisco de Miranda and Thomas Paine. After the violent downfall of the Gironde and the rise of the Reign of Terror, she and her family were thrown into the Luxembourg prison where she was allowed to continue working on translations of French-language works into English, including what would prove to be a popular translation of Bernardin St. Pierre&#x27;s novel &quot;Paul et Virginie&quot;, to which she appended her own prison sonnets. Upon her release, she travelled with John Hurford Stone to Switzerland. She was harshly criticised for this since Stone, separated from an unfaithful wife, was still legally a married man; the subsequent history of Williams and Stone&#x27;s relationship only tended to confirm the rumours. Nonetheless, her few poems from this period continue to express Dissenting piety and were published in volumes with those of other religiously like-minded poets. In 1798, she published &quot;A Tour in Switzerland&quot;, which included an account of her travels, political commentary, and the poem &quot;A Hymn Written Amongst the Alps.&quot;

Williams&#x27; 1801 &quot;Sketches of the State of Manners and Opinions in the French Republic&quot; showed a continued attachment to the original ideals of the French Revolution but a growing disenchantment with the rise of Napoleon; as emperor, he would declare her ode &quot;The Peace signed between the French and the English&quot; (also known as the &quot;Ode on the Peace of Amiens&quot;) to be treasonable to France. Nonetheless, he proved to be, in this respect, more lenient than the revolutionary government had been to this now-famous international literary figure: she spent a single day in prison and continued to live and write in Paris. After the Bourbon Restoration, she became a naturalised French citizen in 1818; nonetheless, in 1819 she moved to Amsterdam to live with Athanase Laurent Charles Coquerel, a nephew she had helped raise. However, she was unhappy in Amsterdam and soon returned to Paris, where, until her death in 1827, she continued to be an important interpreter of French intellectual currents for the English-speaking world.

==Selected works==

<text>The Mendip transmitting station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility on the summit of Pen Hill, part of the Mendip Hills range in Somerset, England, at above sea level. The station is in St Cuthbert Out civil parish, approximately north-east of Wells. Its mast, high, was built in 1967 and is the tallest structure in South West England. The mast broadcasts digital television, FM analogue radio and DAB digital radio, and had broadcast analogue colour television from 1967 until 2010.

== Description ==
The station is owned and operated by Arqiva (which acquired National Grid Wireless, previously Crown Castle).

Until 2008 a GRP aerial cylinder, containing the analogue television transmitting antennas, was mounted at the top of the mast, bringing the total height of the structure to . With a mean height of above sea level, these antennas were among the highest in the UK. They were removed in 2010, the antenna cylinder being replaced with a new antenna assembly, ready for digital switchover later that year. The present assembly is slightly shorter than the previous cylinder, causing the overall mast height to be reduced from to .

There are red aircraft warning lamps (six sets of two lights) on the mast, and two lights on top. The mast can be seen from as far away as Puriton during the day, and the aircraft warning lights make it visible at night from most of the Somerset Levels and from areas of South Wales, such as the high ground near the Wenvoe transmitting station.

==Television==
Mendip was configured as a C/D group transmitter when it entered service with analogue PAL transmissions. In July 2007, Ofcom confirmed that it would remain a C/D group transmitter at digital switchover. The mast broadcasts digital television over a large area of the west of England, including Somerset, Wiltshire, Bristol, southern Gloucestershire, and northern Dorset. Northern Gloucestershire – such as most of Cheltenham and Tewkesbury – is outside the coverage area, instead receiving signals from the Ridge Hill transmitter in Herefordshire.

Cardiff and other parts of southeast Wales were also able to receive the analogue TV transmissions from Mendip, and many households used it in preference to their more local Wenvoe transmitter which carries the Wales variations of BBC One, BBC Two, and ITV. This was originally because the Wenvoe transmitter broadcast S4C (with programmes in Welsh and some prime-time English programmes from Channel 4 scheduled at much later times) rather than Channel 4 itself. Even after digital switchover when transmitters in Wales also began to broadcast Channel 4 in addition to S4C, some households continued with their preference for the West variations of BBC One, BBC Two, and ITV, and having Channel 4 (not S4C) as number 4 on the electronic programme guide.

Power on analogue transmissions was 500 kW (ERP) for BBC 1, BBC2, HTV West, Channel 4, and 126 kW (ERP) for Channel 5. The latter was transmitted outside of the original C/D grouping of the transmitter but most homes in reasonable signal areas for the C/D group could receive it with their C/D group aerial. All six digital multiplexes were transmitted at 10 kW until switchover in 2010 when the power on the &quot;BBC A&quot;, &quot;BBC B/HD&quot; and &quot;D3&amp;4&quot; multiplexes was boosted to 100 kW. In 2011, SDN was boosted to 50 kW and in 2012 the remaining two Arqiva multiplexes were boosted to 50 kW too.

In June 2019, as part of the 700MHz clearance programme, Mendip became K group (excluding muxes 7 and 8, which are due to be switched off between 2020 and 2022). This means that homes in poor signal areas which still have a C/D group aerial may have difficulty in receiving all multiplexes.

Mendip&#x27;s population coverage is around 1.5 million, although some homes in the immediate vicinity, such as those in Cheddar, are unable to receive a signal due to being in the shadow of the Mendip Hills and therefore depend on local relays.

==Radio==
Mendip broadcasts FM (analogue VHF) radio for BBC Radio Somerset and the Severn Estuary regional service Kiss 101. Mendip also transmits high power Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) signals for the Digital One, Sound Digital and BBC National DAB multiplexes. An additional DAB multiplex, MuxCo Somerset, was awarded a licence in 2008 to broadcast local and national services to Somerset, and began transmission in 2014. After the closure of the Severn Estuary digital radio multiplex, the equipment from Mendip was reused to improve coverage on the Welsh coastline for the Cardiff &amp; Newport, now South East Wales, multiplex.

====Analogue and digital====

=====15 November 1998 – 24 March 2010=====
Digital terrestrial television was first transmitted from the Mendip mast from 15 November 1998 using the frequency gaps between the analogue TV broadcasts. To limit interference to the analogue transmissions, power output on the digital multiplexes was low.

=====24 March 2010 – 7 April 2010=====
On 24 March 2010 BBC2 was switched off on UHF 64 and HTV West was switched from UHF 61 for its final weeks of service. Multiplex 1 on UHF 59+ was closed and replaced by BBC A on UHF 61 (which had just been vacated by analogue HTV West). BBC A was transmitted at full power (100 kW) and in 64QAM, 8k carriers mode from the start.

====Digital====

=====7 April 2010 – 28 September 2011=====
Following the completion of analogue TV shutdown on 7 April 2010, Mendip transmitted all of its higher powered multiplexes at 100 kW. From this date until the second-stage switchover of 28 September 2011 the frequency allocation was:

=====28 September 2011 – 28 March 2012=====
With the completion of digital switchover at Oxford, all multiplexes could be moved to their final channel allocations with the exception of Arqiva A. SDN increased to half its full power output (50 kW).

=====28 March 2012 – 26 March 2013=====
On 28 March 2012 Arqiva A moved to its final channel allocation at UHF 56, after the completion of digital switchover at Salisbury. Arqiva A and B and SDN also increased to full power (100 kW) on this date.

=====27 March 2013 – 27 February 2018=====
BBC A moved from UHF 61 to UHF 49 to allow for the clearance of the 800 MHz band for 4G LTE mobile services.

===== 27 February 2018 - 4 April 2019 =====
Arqiva A has moved from UHF 56 to UHF 33 for the start of the 700MHz clearance programme at Mendip. 

===== 4 April 2019 – 5 June 2019 =====
BBC A has moved from UHF 49 to UHF 32 as part of the 700MHz clearance programme at Mendip. 

===== 5 June 2019 - Present =====
Digital 3&amp;4 has moved from UHF 54 to UHF 34, and BBC B have moved as well from UHF 58 to UHF 35 as part of the 700MHz clearance programme at Mendip. Many Welsh residents also prefer Mendip&#x27;s service to the Wenvoe service as it provides a stronger signal to the coastline and areas in the shadow of the Wenvoe mast.

<doc id="1291534" wikidata="Q3851929" url="?curid=1291534" title="Walsh matrix">
<text>In mathematics, a Walsh matrix is a specific square matrix of dimensions 2, where &quot;n&quot; is some particular natural number. The entries of the matrix are either +1 or −1 and its rows as well as columns are orthogonal. The Walsh matrix was proposed by Joseph L. Walsh in 1923. Each row of a Walsh matrix corresponds to a Walsh function.

The Walsh matrices are a special case of Hadamard matrices where the rows are rearranged so that the number of sign changes in a row is in increasing order. In short, a Hadamard matrix is defined by the recursive formula below and is &quot;naturally ordered&quot;, whereas a Walsh matrix is &quot;sequency-ordered&quot;. Confusingly, different sources refer to either matrix as the Walsh matrix.

The Walsh matrix (and Walsh functions) are used in computing the Walsh transform and have applications in the efficient implementation of certain signal processing operations.

==Formula==
The Hadamard matrices of dimension formula_1 for formula_2 are given by the recursive formula (the lowest order of Hadamard matrix is 2):
:formula_3

and in general
:formula_4

for 2 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ∈ N, where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product.

===Permutation===
We can obtain a Walsh matrix from a Hadamard matrix. For that, we first generate the Hadamard matrix for a given dimension. Then, we count the number of sign changes of each row. Finally, we re-order the rows of the matrix according to the number of sign changes in ascending order. 

For example, let us assume that we have a Hadamard matrix of dimension formula_5 

:formula_6,

where the successive rows have 0, 3, 1, and 2 sign changes (we count the number of times we switch from a positive 1 to a negative 1, and vice versa). If we rearrange the rows in sequency ordering, we obtain:

:formula_7

where the successive rows have 0, 1, 2, and 3 sign changes. 

===Alternative forms of the Walsh matrix===
====Sequency ordering====
The sequency ordering of the rows of the Walsh matrix can be derived from the ordering of the Hadamard matrix by first applying the bit-reversal permutation and then the Gray-code permutation:

:formula_8

where the successive rows have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 sign changes.

====Dyadic ordering====
:formula_9

where the successive rows have 0, 1, 3, 2, 7, 6, 4, and 5 sign changes.

====Natural ordering====
:formula_10

where the successive rows have 0, 7, 3, 4, 1, 6, 2, and 5 sign changes (Hadamard matrix).

<text>Rugby League Ireland (RLI) is the internationally recognised governing body for the development of rugby league football in Ireland, having secured official recognition from the RLIF in 2000. It is recognised within the Irish Sports Council and took over the running of the Irish international team entirely in 2008 for the World Cup. Prior to 2001 RLI was known as Ireland Rugby League.

In 2024, the body was downgraded to affiliate member due to noncompliance with the full membership criteria.

==Flag==

The Irish rugby league team draws its players from across the Island of Ireland. At the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, the Ireland team entered the field of play at the beginning of their matches with the Four Provinces Flag of Ireland.

==National team==
The Ireland national rugby league team, known as the &#x27;Wolfhounds&#x27;, represents Ireland in rugby league football. The team is organised by Rugby League Ireland. The representative team is dominated by players from the Super League and sometimes includes players from the Australasian National Rugby League. Ireland is also represented by Ireland A, an amateur side which is made up of players from the domestic Irish competition.

Since Ireland began competing in international rugby league in 1995, it has participated in the 1995 Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament, the 1996 Super League World Nines, and four Rugby League World Cups – 2000, 2008. 2013, and 2017. They have also competed in the Rugby League European Nations Cup and Victory Cup. Ireland A compete annually in the St Patrick&#x27;s Day Challenge in the Amateur Four Nations.

==Competitions==
As of 2024 Rugby League Ireland run two domestic club competitions:
*RLI Premiership (men&#x27;s first tier)
*RLI Women&#x27;s premiership (women&#x27;s first tier)

The RLI Championship (men&#x27;s second tier) is not currently in operation.

<doc id="1291547" wikidata="Q943416" url="?curid=1291547" title="N-Acyl homoserine lactone">
<text>&quot;N&quot;-Acyl homoserine lactones (Abbreviated as AHLs or N-AHLs) are a class of signaling molecules involved in bacterial quorum sensing, a means of communication between bacteria enabling behaviors based on population density.

The first AHL (N-3-(oxo-hexanoyl)-homoserine lactone) was found as the natural inducer of bioluminescence in the bacterium &quot;Vibrio fischeri.&quot; Quorum sensing by the means of AHLs contributes to regulate the transcription of specific genes and therefore expression of specific phenotypes, including growth, virulence, biofilm formation, bioluminescence, production of exopolysaccharide (EPS). Over 50 gram-negative bacteria species (including several pathogenic species) use AHLs as autoinducers and the means of their communication in quorum sensing. In one study, AHL was shown to interact with eukaryotic cells, and mitigate an immune response and facilitates infection. AHLs are one of the major groups of the autoinducer (AI) molecules which are found primarily in gram-negative proteobacteria but also in some bacteriodetes, cyanobacteria, and archaea. The other two major groups are oligopeptides AIs in gram-positive bacteria; and autoinducer-2 (AI-2), as a universal signal for interspecies communications.

==Formation==
It arises by the reaction of acyl carrier proteins react with S-adenosylmethionine. The latter donates the equivalent of 4-aminobutyrolactone. Methylthioadenosine is a coproduct.

Homoserine lactone is also a product of the proteolytic reaction of cyanogen bromide (CNBr) with a methionine residue. This reaction is important for chemical sequencing of proteins.

=== Structure ===
AHLs have hydrophobic and hydrophilic sections. The hydrophilic section consists of the homoserine lactone ring and the amide group. The hydrophobic section has a strain-specific hydrocarbon chain with varieties in length and level of oxygenation with a 3-oxo group. The length of the acyl chain generally ranges from 4 to 18 carbons. The length of R-group side-chain variable. Chain lengths vary from 4 to 18 carbon atoms and in the substitution of a carbonyl at the third carbon. The hydrophilic sections form a hydrogen bonded network within the receptor binding site, while the hydrophobic sites contribute to diffusional and binding properties within the hydrophobic pocket. Studies have not yet demonstrated a correlation between the AHL synthase enzymes and AHL type. LuxI protein synthesizes an acylated homoserin-lactone molecule. The LuxI gene is highly conserved, which indicates that although diverse, there are a limited number of AHL-type signals that are produced by bacteria. However, in the AHL synthase enzyme family, the C-terminal region, which determines the type of substrates the synthetase can recognize and the subsequent acyl-chain length, is not conserved. Moreover, there is no evidence as of now that the distribution of AHL synthase and the species are correlated. Contrary to LuxI genes, the receptors of AHLs, LuxR protein and their genes, are highly variable among species.

==Signalling==
=== Mechanism ===
Bacterial quorum signalling begins with the N-AHLs secreted into the environment.

In the process of quorum sensing, first the LuxI protein synthesizes an acylated homoserin-lactone molecule which can pass through cell membrane along the gradient through diffusion to the environmental space. When the concentration of these autoinducers in the environment is lower than inside the cell, they will move down the gradient and will leave the cell, therefore, they will not attach to their receptor, LuxR, which is in the cytoplasm. When the population of bacteria reaches a threshold, and the concentration of the autoinducers in the environment is higher than inside the cell, they will move along the gradient into the cell and will attach to the receptor. Thus, the LuxR-AHL complex will be formed. This complex will bind to a 20 base pair (bp) section of DNA, called the &quot;lux&quot; box. This region is in or near the &quot;lux&quot; promoter region, which is located ~40 bp upstream of the regulated gene. Because LuxR is bound to the promoter, RNA polymerase is recruited to this promoter region and the gene expression is induced. Moreover, the LuxR-AHL complex will upregulate the transcription of LuxI protein which will increase the production of AHLs (positive feedback loop). The transcription of the target genes will be regulated, and as gene expression of an entire population will be coordinated. Several studies have been investigating on the potential AHLs effective in infection and resistance to antibiotics. The LuxR–LuxI system mediated by AHLs is the best screened QS system in multi-drug resistant bacteria species.

=== Quorum Quenching ===
As opposed to quorum sensing, quorum quenching, prevents bacterial communication and influences their gene expression. Targets of the quorum quenching are the signal molecules, the biosynthetic machinery of signal molecules, and the regulatory proteins that perceive these signal molecules with the AHL degradation via AHL degrading enzymes and limiting signal accumulation being the main mechanism. The AHLs are degraded by enzymes through three mechanisms: lactone hydrolysis, amide bond hydrolysis, and acyl chain modification. Lactone hydrolysis occurs when AHL Lactonase hydrolyzes homoserine lactone rings. This process was first observed in &quot;Bacillus&quot; species. AHL acylases catalyze the complete and irreversible destruction of AHLs through the hydrolysis of amide bonds. AHL oxidase and reductase, first discovered in &quot;Rhodococcus erythropolis,&quot; catalyze a change in the chemical structure of signals, which affects AHL signal recognition and interferes with quorum sensing regulated processes. The second AHLase is a &quot;Bacillus megaterium&quot; P450 monooxygenase that oxidizes fatty acids and N-fatty acyl amino acids. Lactonases and acylases are the two pioneers of quorum quenching mechanisms. Lactonases break down the lactone bonds in autoinducers, making them unable to bind to target transcriptional regulators and thereby increasing disease resistance.

=== Impacts of AHLs on Plants ===
Plants have a critical role in shaping our world and their relationship with microorganisms is of significant importance. Over the long history of coevolution of plants and microbes, plants have evolved to respond to the symbiotic or pathogenic microbes in appropriate ways with an adapted gene expression profile such as cooperation with bacterial saprotrophs leading to an endophytic life or defense responses against pathogens. AHLs play an important role in the symbiosis of rhizobium and legumes which will result in the formation of nodules. Experiments have reported that application of AHLs activates the auxin-responsible GH3 promoter (upregulate auxin-related genes), and down-regulates the genes related to cytokinin (the change in the ratio between auxin and cytokinin can promote growth). Also, followed by applying AHL, the nodulation in roots has been enhanced. Moreover, the water and mineral flow through the plant was higher as stomata opening increased, and therefore the overall transpiration rate changed. Aside from AHL-mediated bacteria-plant beneficial interactions, QS-signaling AHL compounds were shown to function as important communication signal in tripartite symbiotic bacteria-fungus-plant interactions. The endophytic bacterium with AHL-autoinduction and produces a variety of long side-chain AHLs seems to assist the fungus to interact in a symbiotic manner with the colonized host plants. The fungus &quot;Serendipita indica,&quot; which was isolated from the rhizosphere of plants, is associated with stress tolerance and plant growth promotion. It was shown that this fungus harbors an endofungal bacterium, &quot;Rhizobium radiobacter&quot; F4, which genes of AHL-autoinduction. When &quot;R. radiobacter&quot; F4 was inoculated to &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; or wheat (&quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;), it conferred similar stimulation of growth and yield, as well as priming of the defense responses and increasing environmental fitness. Interestingly, when the AHL-compounds were depleted, root colonization, growth promotion and resistance-inducing activities diminished. These findings suggest that whenever the fungus &quot;S. indica&quot; is applied to support growth vigor of diverse plants, the endofungal AHL-producing &quot;R. radiobacter&quot; are colonizing the host plant and participate to steer the coordination of microbe-plant interaction.

=== AHLs and Nitrogen Cycle ===
Microbes are a key player in charge of the fate of nitrogen in soil and water. AHL-mediated quorum sensing has an important role in Nitrogen cycle. All nitrifying bacteria and some denitrifying bacteria use AHL as their signal molecules. AHLs influence the efficiency of and regulate the functions involved in nitrification and denitrification. Some bacterial species of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, like &quot;Nitrosomonas europaea, Nitrosospira multiformis, Nitrosospira briensis&quot;, use C6- to C14- AHLs. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), such as &quot;Nitrobacter winogradskyi, Nitrobacter vulgaris, and Nitrospira moscoviensis, also use C8- or C10- AHLs&quot;. &quot;Candidatus Jettenia caeni&quot; with anaerobic ammonium oxidation (annamox) mode uses C6- and C8- AHLs. Moreover, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Paracoccus denitrificans&quot; as denitrifying bacteria also use C4-HSL and C16-AHL, respectively. In some of the nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria like &quot;Nitrobacter hamburgensis&quot; AHLs were not found although putative AHL synthetase and receptor proteins were.

<text>On the morning of July 2, 1956, three explosions involving scrap thorium occurred at the Sylvania Electric Products&#x27; Metallurgical Laboratory in Bayside, (now Bay Terrace) Queens, New York. Nine people were injured, some severely. One 28 year old employee, Oliver Blaber died on August 6, 1956. Workers described three fireballs.

Sylvania was experimenting with large-scale production of thorium metal from thorium dioxide. Part of the process of shutting down this experiment was the reprocessing and burning of thorium metal powder sludges that went unprocessed during the experiment. It was during the incineration of this material that the explosion occurred. At the time the metallurgical properties of thorium were not well understood.

The plant&#x27;s medical director stated to the press at the time that the employee who died as a result, Oliver Blaber, had succumbed to &quot;complications caused by third-degree burns&quot;. Blaber&#x27;s son would later cite the death certificate, which listed &quot;thorium poisoning&quot;. Victims of the explosions were treated at Flushing Hospital, where both Blaber&#x27;s mother and wife worked. Blaber died a month after the incident, on August 6, 1956.

Three hundred people – 225 employees, 50 firefighters, and 25 police officers – were tested for radiation. The role of radiation was downplayed, especially to assuage fears that a nuclear explosion had occurred. The debris from the explosion was ultimately disposed of in the ocean.

<doc id="1291553" wikidata="Q783742" url="?curid=1291553" title="Pico Duarte">
<text>Pico Duarte is the highest peak in the Dominican Republic, on the island of Hispaniola and in all the Caribbean. At above sea level, it gives Hispaniola the 16th-highest maximum elevation of any island in the world. Additionally, it is only northeast of the region&#x27;s lowest point, Lake Enriquillo, 46 m (151 ft) below sea level. It is part of the Cordillera Central range, which extends from the plains between San Cristóbal and Baní to the northwestern peninsula of Haiti, where it is known as the Massif du Nord. The highest elevations of the Cordillera Central are found in the Pico Duarte and Valle Nuevo massifs.

==History==
The first reported climb was made in 1851 by a German who was British consul: Sir Robert Hermann Schomburgk. He named the mountain &quot;Monte Tina&quot; and estimated its height at . In 1912, Father Miguel Fuertes dismissed Schomburgk&#x27;s calculations after climbing La Rucilla and judging it to be the tallest summit of the island. A year later, Swedish botanist Erik Leonard Ekman sided with Schomburgk&#x27;s estimate, and called the sister summits &quot;Pelona Grande&quot; and &quot;Pelona Chica&quot; (&quot;Big Bald One&quot; and &quot;Small Bald One&quot;, respectively). During the Rafael Trujillo Molina regime, the taller of the two was called &quot;Pico Trujillo&quot;. After the dictator&#x27;s death, it was renamed Pico Duarte, in honor of Juan Pablo Duarte, one of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s founding fathers. At the summit is an east-facing bronze bust of Duarte atop a stone pedestal, next to a flagpole that flies the Dominican flag and a cross.

==Geography==
The mountain&#x27;s elevation was debated for decades, up until the mid-1990s, when it was still held to be high. In 2003, it was measured by a researcher using GPS technology, and it was found to be tall. The official elevation as recorded by Dominican government agencies is , a measurement that has been confirmed by several groups of hikers using personal GPS consoles (the most recent verified one in January 2005). In 2021 a team of researchers using GSSM technology found that its altitude is with a margin of error of .

It is only a few meters taller than La Pelona, its twin, which stands at , and from which it is separated by a col between summits that is approximately wide, and is officially named &quot;Valle del Baíto&quot;, but unofficially called &quot;Valle de Lilís&quot;. The col&#x27;s mean elevation is .

==Ecology==

The area has an oceanic climate that very few would associate as typical of a Caribbean island, with cool temperatures all year round, going several degrees below freezing during winter nights.

The mountain and the surrounding landscape are covered in &quot;pino de cuaba&quot; (&quot;Pinus occidentalis&quot;) forests. The pines frequently host the epiphytes &quot;guajaca&quot; (&quot;Tillandsia&quot; spp.) and the parasitic &quot;Dendropemon pycnophyllus&quot;. Some areas, like the Valle de Lilís, are treeless meadows of tussock-like &quot;pajones&quot; (&quot;Danthonia domingensis&quot;). The understory is composed of shrub such as &quot;Lyonia heptamera&quot;, &quot;Myrica picardae&quot;, &quot;Myrsine coriacea&quot;, &quot;Ilex tuerkheimii&quot;, &quot;Garrya fadyenii&quot; and &quot;Baccharis myrsinites&quot;. All of these species are adapted to the acidic soil of the area.

Reptiles in the area include the endemic &quot;Panolopus marcanoi&quot;. Birds seen in the area include the endemic Hispaniolan palm crow (&quot;Corvus palmarum palmarum&quot;), Antillean siskin (&quot;Carduelis dominicensis&quot;), rufous-throated solitaire (&quot;Myadestes genibarbis&quot;), Hispaniolan crossbill (&quot;Loxia megaplaga&quot;) (whose abundance is directly related to the Hispaniolan pine cone crop), and Hispaniolan trogon (&quot;Priotelus roseigaster&quot;); at lower elevations the Hispaniolan amazon (&quot;Amazona ventralis&quot;), scaly-naped pigeon (&quot;Patagioenas squamosa&quot;) and golden swallow (&quot;Tachycineta euchrysea&quot;) can be seen. There are two extant mammals endemic to Hispaniola whose remaining range includes the broadleaf forests of lower elevations: the primarily nocturnal Hispaniolan solenodon (&quot;Solenodon paradoxus&quot;) and the Hispaniolan hutia (&quot;Plagiodontia aedium&quot;). Both are rarely seen, with the latter considered Endangered. Wild boar, descendants of animals introduced to the island during the colonial period, have been reported.

A wildfire in 2003 altered the landscape of a large section of the eastern side of the mountain. As of 2008, the hillside of charred trees is now a new-growth forest. While thousands of charred trees are still standing, a large variety of indigenous grasses and small plants are now growing.

==Climbing information==

There is a system of trails leading up to the summit, with trailheads at several locations (their final stretches to the summit are seen on the topographic map). The easiest access is from the town of La Ciénaga, near Jarabacoa. The trail is to the summit, with a total elevation change of , and a shelter away from the summit at La Comparticion. Tourist-friendly travel agencies can help arrange trips from this trailhead, using mules in their employ to help lug food, sleeping bags and supplies for the overnight stay in the shelter.

A few fresh water springs labeled &quot;potable&quot; are along the trail, but water filters or purifying tablets are recommended. The majority of hikers travel by this route.

A trailhead northwest of the town of San Juan de la Maguana is the starting point for four-day (three-night) trips that end at the Ciénaga trailhead (or, for an extra day of hiking, back at the starting location), which are run entirely by local Dominicans who cook the food provided, and help campers along the way. Each night is spent in shelters, and due to the distance traveled, riding by mule-back is strongly encouraged. Far off the beaten path, it is highly unlikely that anyone else can be seen on the trail until the merge with the trail from La Ciénaga. 

According to Dominican Park Service representatives in La Cienaga, while approximately 1,000 hikers visit Pico Duarte during each of the months of December and January; only about 10 to 15 people a day hike the mountain during off-season months.

<text>Indo-Persian culture refers to a cultural synthesis present on the Indian subcontinent. It is characterised by the absorption or integration of Persian aspects into the various cultures of modern-day republics of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. The earliest introduction of Persian influence and culture to the subcontinent was by various Muslim Turko-Persian rulers, such as the 11th-century Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, rapidly pushed for the heavy Persianization of conquered territories in northwestern Indian subcontinent, where Islamic influence was also firmly established. This socio-cultural synthesis arose steadily through the Delhi Sultanate from the 13th to 16th centuries, and the Mughal Empire from then onwards until the 19th century. Various dynasties of Turkic, Iranian and local Indian origin patronized the Persian language and contributed to the development of a Persian culture in India. The Delhi Sultanate developed their own cultural and political identity which built upon Persian and Indic languages, literature and arts, which formed the basis of an Indo-Muslim civilization.

Persian was the official language of most Muslim dynasties in the Indian subcontinent, such as the Delhi Sultanate, the Kashmir Sultanate, the Bengal Sultanate, the Mughal Empire and their successor states, and the Sikh Empire. It was also the dominant cultured language of poetry and literature. Many of the Sultans and nobility in the Sultanate period were Persianised Turks from Central Asia who spoke Turkic languages as their mother tongues. The Mughals were also culturally Persianised Central Asians (of Turko-Mongol origin on their paternal side), but spoke Chagatai Turkic as their first language at the beginning, before eventually adopting Persian. Persian became the preferred language of the Muslim elite of northern India. Muzaffar Alam, a noted scholar of Mughal and Indo-Persian history, suggests that Persian became the official &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Mughal Empire under Akbar for various political and social factors due to its non-sectarian and fluid nature. The influence of these languages led to a vernacular called Hindustani that is the direct ancestor language of today&#x27;s Hindi–Urdu varieties.

The Persianisation of the Indian subcontinent resulted in its incorporation into the cosmopolitan Persianate world of &quot;Ajam&quot;, known today academically as Greater Iran, which historically gave many inhabitants a secular, Persian identity.

==History==
With the presence of Islamic culture in the region in the Ghaznavid period, Lahore and Uch were established as centres of Persian literature. Abu-al-Faraj Runi and Masud Sa&#x27;d Salman (d. 1121) were the two earliest major Persian poets based in Lahore. The earliest of the &quot;great&quot; Indo-Persian poets was Amir Khusrow (d. 1325) of Delhi, who has since attained iconic status within the Urdu speakers of the Indian subcontinent as, among other things, the &quot;father&quot; of Urdu literature.

===Delhi sultanate and the Mughal era===

Indo-Persian culture flourished in North India during the period of the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526). The invasion of Babur in 1526, the end of the Delhi Sultanate and the establishment of what would become the Mughal Empire would usher the golden age of Indo-Persian culture with particular reference to the art and architecture of the Mughal era.

During the Mughal era, Persian persisted as the language of the Mughals up to and including the year 1707 which marked the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb, generally considered the last of the &quot;Great Mughals&quot;. Thereafter, with the decline of the Mughal empire, the 1739 invasion of Delhi by Nader Shah and the gradual growth initially of the Hindu Marathas and later the European power within the Indian subcontinent, Persian or Persian culture commenced a period of decline although it nevertheless enjoyed patronage and may even have flourished within the many regional empires or kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent including that of the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh (r. 1799–1837).

Persian as a language of governance and education was abolished in 1839 by the British East India Company and the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, even if his rule was purely symbolic or ceremonial, was dethroned in 1857 by the British.

Further, C.E. Bosworth writes about the significance of Persian culture that developed a mark within Muslim sultans in this era that: &quot;The sultans were generous patrons of the Persian literary traditions of Khorasan, and latterly fulfilled a valuable role as transmitters of this heritage to the newly conquered lands of northern India, laying the foundations for the essentially Persian culture which was to prevail in Muslim India until the 19th century.&quot;

===Deccan===

The Deccan region&#x27;s integration into the Indo-Persian culture of the north began in the early 14th century, when the Delhi Sultanate made political movements towards the south, and the Deccan was brought into the Sultanate under the conquests of the Tughluq dynasty. Due to the Sultan Muhammad Shah policy of ordering a migration of the North Indian Muslim population of Delhi to the Deccan city of Daulatabad in 1327, in order to build a large Muslim urban centre in the Deccan. This led to a formal introduction of Indo-Persian culture in the Deccan, extending beyond the realm of the court.
In the middle of the 14th century, the Urdu-speaking immigrant population of Daulatabad staged a revolt breaking off from the Delhi Sultanate, but Indo-Persian culture lived on in the region. The breakaway Bahmani Sultanate was established in 1347, by Hasan Gangu. Its rulers were greatly influenced by Persian culture, they were well-versed in the language and its literature, and promoted Persian language education throughout their empire. The Persianised nature of the court is reflected in the fact that the Bahmanis celebrated festivals like Nowruz. The architecture cultivated by them had significant Iranian influences, even more than that of the Muslims in the north.

The Bahmani Sultans actively recruited Persian or Persianised men in their administration, and such foreigners were in fact favoured over Indians who were known as the Dakhani. Sultan Firuz Shah (1397–1422) sent ships from his ports in Goa and Chaul to the Persian Gulf to bring back talented men of letters, administrators, jurists, soldiers and artisans. This included the high-born Iranian Mahmud Gawan (1411–1481) who rose to become a powerful minister of that state during the reign of another Bahmani Sultan.
This led to factional strife between the Dakhanis, the ruling indigenous Muslim elite of the Bahmanid dynasty, being descendants of Sunni immigrants from Northern India, and the foreign newcomers like Mahmud Gawan who were called the Afaqis(Cosmopolitans or Travellers). According to Richard Eaton, Dakhanis believed that the privileges, patronage and positions of power in the Sultanate should have been reserved solely for them, based on their ethnic origin and their sense of pride of having launched the Bahmanid dynasty. Eaton also cites a linguistic divide where the Dakhanis spoke the Dakhni dialect of the Urdu language while the Afaqis favored the Persian language. In 1481, the Dakhanis poisoned the ears of the Sultan, leading to the execution of Mahmud Gawan. What followed was a wholescale massacre of the Iranian Georgian and Turkmen population in the urban centres by Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri, who lead the Deccani faction. Factional strife between the Afaqis and Dakhanis resulted in pitched battles with the Afaqis usually being victims of violence due to the Deccanis&#x27; greater ties to local military networks. This frequently resulted in indiscriminate violence towards people of Iranian origin including learned men, pilgrims, petty merchants, nobles and servants, such the massacres of foreigners of Chakan in 1450, Bidar in 1481, and Ahmadnagar in 1591 by the Deccan Muslims. According to Eaton, the Dakhanis and Afaqis represented more than just two competing factions jostling for influence in the court; they stood for differing conceptions of state and society. If the Dakhanis manifested a colonial idea, namely, a society composed of transplanted settler-founders and their descendants, the Afaqis or Cosmopolitans represented a cultural idea, a refined style of comportment, an eminent tradition of statescraft, a prestigious language. Since each class was legitimate in its own way, neither could be fully disloged from the Bahmanid political system or the Deccan Sultanates. However, the activity of the Afaqis, unlike the Dakhani Muslim nobles, were solely dependent on the patronization of their host Dakhani Sultans, so that whenever there was a change or instability in the court, the Afaqis would leave altogether. Sebouh Aslanian described this mobile community as a &quot;circulation society&quot;. According to Roy Fischel, more than any other group, the Dakhani Muslims were the social group that were most associated with the Deccan Sultanates, and the most dominant political group when it comes to determining the direction of the Sultanates.

According to Richard Eaton, even the Hindu Vijayanagara empire from the same period was highly Persianised in its culture. The royal quarters of the capital had many Persian architectural elements such as domes and vaulted arches.

The Bahmani Sultanate disintegrated into five Deccan Sultanates, similar in culture. Hyderabad, built by the Golconda Sultanate in the 16th century, was inspired by Isfahan. The use of Persian as a court language in Hyderabad continued under the Nizams of Hyderabad, and was only replaced by Urdu in 1886.

The court language during the Deccan sultanate period was Persian or Arabic, however, Marathi was widely used during the period especially by the Adil Shahis of Bijapur and the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Although the rulers were Muslims, the local feudal landlords and the revenue collectors were Hindus and so was the majority of the population. Political expediency made it important for the sultans to make use of Marathi. Nevertheless, Marathi in official documents from the era is totally Persianised in its vocabulary. The Persian influence continues to this day with many Persian derived words used in everyday speech such as bāg (Garden), kārkhānā (factory), shahar (city), bāzār (market), dukān (shop), hushār (clever), kāgad (paper), khurchi (chair), zamīn (land), zāhirāt (advertisement), and hazār (thousand).

===Bengal===

Bengal was the easternmost frontier of the Persian cultural sphere. For over 600 years (1204–1837), the Persian language was an official language in Bengal, including during the provincial period of the Delhi Sultanate; the independent period of the Bengal Sultanate; the dominion period of the Bengal Subah in the Mughal Empire; and the quasi-independent Nawabi period. Bengal was the subcontinent&#x27;s wealthiest region for centuries, where Persian people, as well as Persianate Turks, settled in the Ganges delta to work as teachers, lawyers, poets, administrators, soldiers and aristocrats. The Bengali language continues to have a significant number of Persian loanwords. A popular literary dialect called Dobhashi emerged which mixed Persian and Bengali words as a writing format. Several Bengali cities were once centres of Persian prose and poetry. Hafez, one of the masters of Persian poetry, kept a notable correspondence with Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah and they composed a poem together. The Mughal period saw the zenith of Persian cultural expression in Bengal.

During the Bengali Renaissance, Persian was studied by not only Bengali Muslims but even Hindu scholars, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy. From the mid-eighteenth century towards the 19th century, five to six daily magazines were published in Calcutta, most notably the Durbin and the Sultan al-Akhbar.

The use of Persian as an official language was prohibited by Act no. XXIX of 1837 passed by the President of the Council of India in Council on 20 November 1837.

== During the British colonial era ==

Given that the Mughals had historically symbolised Indo-Persian culture to one degree or another, the dethroning of Bahadur Shah Zafar and the institution of the direct control of the British Crown in 1858 may be considered as marking the end of the Indo-Persian era, even if, after the Indian Rebellion, Persian would still retain an audience and even produce commendable literature such as the philosophical poetry of Muhammad Iqbal (d. 1938). The British would absorb elements of the culture&#x27;s architectural style into the buildings of the Raj, producing Indo-Saracenic architecture. For 20th century Indian Muslims, and Urdu poets in particular, learning the Persian language was viewed as necessary for a full understanding of Urdu and central to the comportment of an educated North Indian Muslim man.

== Adab ==
In Indo-Persian cultures in North India, Adab, which could be understood as a form of virtue ethics, is a code of values determining social behavior that forms the defining characteristic in Indo-Muslim culture.

== Language ==
== Cuisine ==

The Indo-Persian synthesis led to the development of cuisine that combined indigenous foods and ingredients with the tastes and methods of the Turko-Persians. This was especially under the Mughals, who invited cooks (&quot;bawarchis)&quot; from various parts of the Islamic world. This resultant cuisine is referred to as Mughlai cuisine, and has left a great impact on the regional eating habits of South Asia. It was further developed in the kitchens of regional Islamic powers, leading to distinctive styles such as the Awadhi and Hyderabadi cuisines.

Due to this synthesis, the Indian subcontinent shares Central and West Asian food, such as &quot;naan&quot; and &quot;kebab&quot;, and is home to unique dishes such as &quot;biryani.&quot;

== Architecture ==

The Indian subcontinent&#x27;s Islamic period produced architecture that drew stylistically from Persianate culture, using features such as domes, iwans, minars, and baghs. Early Islamic rulers tended to use spolia from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain buildings, resulting in an Indianised style which would be refined by later kingdoms. Hence monuments came to feature uniquely Indian architectural elements, such as corbelled arches and jali. The main buildings produced were mosques, forts, and tombs. These still stand today and are well-represented in the architecture of cities such as Lahore, Delhi, and Hyderabad, to name a few.

Indo-Persian architecture was not exclusive to Islamic power, as the members and rulers of other religions incorporated it in their monuments. Sikh architecture is a notable example of this. The Hindu Vijayanagara Empire used Indo-Persian architecture in courtly monuments.

== Music ==

Prior to Islamic conquest, the Indian subcontinent had a history of musical practice that drew from Sanskritic culture. The subsequent Indo-Persian synthesis resulted in an influx of Iranian musical elements, leading to further developments in the region&#x27;s musical culture through the patronage of new Persianate rulers. This appears to have been the impetus for divergence in indigenous music, leading to the divergence of Hindustani classical music from Carnatic Music. Some of the main instruments used in this style, such as the sitar, santoor and sarod, are thought to have close historical ties with Persian instruments (for an example, see setar). Musical genres such as &quot;khyal&quot; and &quot;tarana&quot;, and the musical performance of &quot;ghazals&quot;, are examples of the Indo-Persian musical confluence. Notably, the Sufi devotional music of &quot;qawwali&quot; bears evident impact from Persian influence, such as the frequent usage of Persian poems.

The creation of many of these practices is credited to 13th-century poet, scholar, and musician Amir Khusrau.

<text>Bolesław Leśmian (born Bolesław Lesman; 22 January 1877 – 5 November 1937) was a Polish poet, artist, and member of the Polish Academy of Literature, one of the first poets to introduce Symbolism and Expressionism to Polish verse. 

Though largely a marginal figure in his lifetime, Leśmian is now considered one of Poland&#x27;s greatest poets. He is, however, little known outside Poland, mostly on account of his neologism-rich idiosyncratic style, dubbed &quot;almost untranslatable&quot; by Czesław Miłosz and &quot;the ultimate and overwhelming proof for the untranslatability of poetry&quot; by noted Polish Shakespearean translator, Stanisław Barańczak.

==Life==

Bolesław Leśmian was born on 22 January 1877 in Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, to a Polonized Jewish family. He spent his childhood and youth in Kyiv, where he graduated from the law faculty of Saint Vladimir University. In 1901 he returned to Warsaw. From there, he visited various European cities, including Munich and Paris, where he married painter Zofia Chylińska. Heavily influenced by French modernists, Leśmian returned to Warsaw, where he became cofounder of an experimental &quot;Artistic Theatre&quot;. There he also met one of his closest friends, Zenon Przesmycki, with whom he became involved in the publication of &quot;Chimera&quot;, an art newspaper.

Although he made his debut in 1895 (a series of poems published in &quot;Wędrowiec&quot; magazine), his works initially went unnoticed. To sound &quot;more Polish&quot;, Leśmian adopted a slightly modified version of his surname which included typically Polish sounds (previously it had been Lesman). According to various conflicting sources, the author of the pen-name which eventually became his official surname was either the known poet and poet&#x27;s uncle Antoni Lange, or a renowned bon-vivant of Warsaw, Franc Fiszer. The first booklet issued in Warsaw in 1912 (&quot;Sad Rozstajny&quot;) did not bring him much publicity either, and in 1912 Leśmian moved back to France. He returned in 1914.

From 1918 until 1934, he worked as a notary of large landed estates in Hrubieszów and then as a lawyer in Zamość. At the same time he published the best known of his books: &quot;Łąka&quot; (&quot;The Meadow&quot;, 1920) and &quot;Napój cienisty&quot; (&quot;Shadowy Drink&quot;, 1936). In 1933, he was accepted as a permanent member of the Polish Academy of Literature. In 1935, he moved back to Warsaw, where he died two years later. He is buried in Powązki Cemetery, in the Alley of the Meritorious, among other notable Polish writers, politicians and military men.

Leśmian and Chylińska had two daughters, one of who, Wanda &quot;Dunia&quot; Leśmianówna, would later marry British adventurer and traveller Denis Hills. Actress and singer Gillian Hills - famous for her brief appearances in Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot; and Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; in two similar scenes - was born of this marriage in 1944. Leśmian was nephew of the famous poet and writer of the Young Poland movement, Antoni Lange, and the cousin of another notable poet of the epoch, Jan Brzechwa.

==Work==
To Polish readers, Leśmian&#x27;s style is unique and easily recognizable, intuitively accessible despite its idiosyncrasy. In his poems, in a fantastical, mythical and fabulous environment — often inhabited with creatures taken from the Polish folklore and traditions — Leśmian expounds his life philosophy, revolving around his equally deep and personal fascinations with God and death. The protagonists of his works are usually &quot;handicapped humans&quot;, struggling between Culture and Nature, unable to accept their in-between existence. For Leśmian, the only ones who can do this - the only ones able to live with both Culture and Nature simultaneously — are poets, the last examples of &quot;the primitive mankind.&quot;

Relying heavily on &quot;the vertiginous word-formation potential of Polish,&quot; Leśmian&#x27;s style is especially notable for its numerous neologisms, many of which are still in use in everyday Polish language (as opposed to, say, Cyprian Norwid&#x27;s similar experiments). Referred to as &quot;leśmianisms&quot; by subsequent scholars, these neologisms are usually the product of the versatile &quot;prefix+verb/noun(+suffix)&quot; formula natural to most Slavic languages, but peculiar to many other languages, rendering Leśmian&#x27;s poetry &quot;almost untranslatable&quot; into English.

Some of Leśmian&#x27;s favourite prefixes include those who imply a lack of certain qualities (like &quot;bez-&quot; or &quot;nie-&quot;, loosely, &quot;without,&quot; or &quot;non-&quot;), leading certain scholars to dub him &quot;the Dante of non-being.&quot; Considered one of the greatest Polish poets in history, Leśmian is certainly one of the most interesting artists of the interwar period, creator of a uniquely stylised Polish folk ballad and profoundly personal — and, nevertheless, popular — metaphysical lyrics. In addition, he is frequently mentioned as the most notable poet of erotic verses in the history of the Polish language.

<doc id="1291563" wikidata="Q16161258" url="?curid=1291563" title="Making Fiends (web series)">
<text>Making Fiends is an adult animated web series by Amy Winfrey. It follows the interactions between Vendetta, a villainous tomboy that regularly makes terrible creatures called &quot;fiends&quot;, and Charlotte, a cheerful and gullible girly-girl who thinks that Vendetta is her best friend. Charlotte unintentionally irritates and annoys Vendetta. As a result, Vendetta attempts to assassinate her with fiends, but she always fails due to Charlotte&#x27;s luck.

The site was first put up on June 3, 2003, and the series debuted with its first episode on July 14, 2003. In 2004, the series was licensed by Nickelodeon, and eventually the episodes were broadcast on TurboNick. The series would later be uploaded to Amy Winfrey&#x27;s YouTube page in 2012 in remastered HD quality. A 30-minute animated horror comedy cartoon television series was greenlit in 2008 on Nicktoons, which aired only 6 episodes each before being cancelled. Nickelodeon Animation Studio, Cyber Chicken Animation Studio and DQ Entertainment Limited all televised the TV show.

==Characters==
Vendetta: (Voiced by Aglaia Mortcheva) Vendetta is a sociopathic, narcissistic and histrionic young tomboy with the power to create &quot;fiends&quot; with a book of recipes. She is moss green and wears pigtails that tend to fly up when she yells. She constantly squints her eyes for emphasis. She spends her time reading magazines and tormenting the other children in her school with her monstrous creations. She uses her dangerous fiends to get what she wants, such as her constant assistant Grudge who helps her give out physical punishment. She develops a one-sided rivalry with Charlotte, and often attempts to kill her. Vendetta almost always uses fiends for her attempts, but she has also done methods like tricking Charlotte into wearing concrete shoes and walking off the edge of a pier. She despises music, to the point of being hurt by it. Her diet consists of almost entirely beef jerky, clams, and grape punch. She speaks in a thick Bulgarian accent and has somewhat broken English. Vendetta appeared in every episode except for episode 14.

Charlotte: (Voiced by Amy Winfrey) A light-blue, optimistic girly-girl from Vermont. She has curly hair and wears a hairbow. Charlotte believes that all creatures are cute and harmless, and everybody is a potential friend. She tries to find the best in any person or situation, and ignores anything she finds strange. She is convinced that Vendetta is her new best friend, much to Vendetta&#x27;s chagrin. Charlotte&#x27;s naivete and oblivious invulnerability results in many of Vendetta&#x27;s plans for torment to backfire. Vendetta seeks to kill Charlotte, but is never successful. A running gag is that Charlotte sees projectiles thrown at her as gifts. Almost every episode includes her singing a song that she makes up on the spot. Charlotte has the uncanny ability to hold her breath for nine hours. She has a pet hamster named Buttons. Charlotte is the only character present in every web episode.

Grudge: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) Vendetta&#x27;s giant hamster fiend, mistaken for a bear by Charlotte and a dog by Mrs. Minty. Grudge does not speak, but rather grunts and growls, and is Vendetta&#x27;s constant sidekick. He assists Vendetta in making fiends and giving threats to those who defy her. Vendetta almost never refers to him by name, simply calling him &quot;hamster&quot;. Unlike most other fiends, he seems to actually care for Vendetta and her safety, despite her harsh treatment of him. Like Rubella and the cat fiend, he is also capable of eating inedible objects. In episode 18, Grudge is replaced by Rubella. In episode 20, Vendetta takes Grudge back after he protects her from rogue fiends.

Mr. Milk: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) The teacher of Charlotte&#x27;s and Vendetta&#x27;s class. He is a beige, nearly bald man with a tie and glasses whose few remaining hairs stick up when he is scared or surprised. He speaks in a nervous, disjointed monotone due to Vendetta&#x27;s domination, and is forced to do Vendetta&#x27;s bidding out of fear of her. He is also afraid of the fanged red bird fiend that is constantly glaring at him. Mr. Milk is probably inspired by Caspar Milquetoast, a comic book character remarkably similar to him. He also physically resembles the South Park character Herbert Garrison, notable because Amy Winfrey worked on the first few episodes of South Park. He has a tenor singing voice.

Marion: (Voiced by Amy Winfrey) A pale blue, overweight girl who sits next to Charlotte and speaks in a nasal whisper. She has a collection of glass animals, and has many allergies. A cowardly girl, she was the first student to talk to Charlotte and warn her about Vendetta. She appears to be friends with Malachi, and her DVD commentary implies that she has a crush on Marvin.

Malachi: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) A grey boy who follows Charlotte around school, giving her dire cautions about Vendetta and her fiends, which Charlotte does not understand and ignores. He is Marion&#x27;s friend. He is a Puritan; he speaks in complicated, archaic English and refuses to sing because it is blasphemous.

Marvin: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) A taller, dark green boy who almost always starts his sentences with &quot;my&quot;, usually because his belongings are always stolen from him, but also as a verbal tic. Once an episode, he will exclaim &quot;My [possession]!&quot;. He is very unlucky, slow and weak. According to Marion&#x27;s commentary, he brought a banana to show and tell because his father works at the banana factory.

Maggie: (Voiced by Amy Winfrey) A grey girl who sits next to Marvin and doesn&#x27;t speak until episode 14, when she cogently remarks, &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s dumb&quot;. In the background, she is seen writing.

Rubella: (Voiced by Elissa Calfin) Vendetta&#x27;s replacement fiend sidekick. She is a giant doll who resembles Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. She eats non-edible food (like wood, glass and plaster) and talks in one- and two-word sentences. She is named after the disease Rubella. She thinks of Vendetta as her friend rather than boss, and gave her a musical toy bear, which angered Vendetta and let her to abandonment.

Giant Kitty: (Voiced by Amy Winfrey) Also called &quot;Hellcat&quot;. A giant red cat fiend, and the first fiend to appear in the web cartoon. He often attacks the students when they&#x27;re outside, and has an immense appetite, able to eat anything that will fit in his stomach. He is temporarily tamed by Charlotte, where Charlotte brushes and cares for him, although he gets angry again when Charlotte says he needs a bath.

Buttons: Charlotte&#x27;s pet hamster, her &quot;favorite hamster in the whole world&quot;, first seen in episode 2. He is known for making a high-pitched noise at the sign of any danger.

Scissor fiend: A fiend Vendetta made for Charlotte that resembles a bird and can cut things with its scissorlike beak. Charlotte thinks it&#x27;s a puppy, and it ends up being her friend instead of killing her. It has a talent for making Valentines gifts. It tries to rescue Charlotte even in the most dangerous situations. In the TV series, Charlotte names it Buttons 2.

Mrs. Minty: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) A substitute teacher. She is an elderly woman who, true to her name, is mint green. She refers to the classmates as &quot;buttercups&quot;, &quot;ducklings&quot;, and other diminutive terms of endearment. She seems to be unaware of Vendetta&#x27;s reputation and abilities, not unlike Charlotte. Her main debut is in episode 9, and she is also seen in episodes 20 and 21, but does not talk.

Mort: A blue boy with glasses that was seen in episode 19, being picked up by an ice cream fiend. He is added as another student in Mr. Milk&#x27;s classroom in the TV series.

Other recurring characters include the Mrs. Millet the lunch lady, and her pet red frog-like fiend on the lunch counter that controls her. There are also other grey, unnamed students, a girl with clips in her hair that is often seen screaming and waving her arms in the episode &quot;Vegetables&quot;, and a boy with a baseball cap, both of which are in the classroom next to Vendetta&#x27;s.

==Games==
* Halloween Treat (Released October 25th, 2004)
A flash game that is put on the website on Halloween (web series style.) Unlike the Christmas Bonus and Thanksgiving Treat, its URL is not available on the official website year-round, although it can be played here (renamed Pumpkin Plunkin on Nick.com). At the beginning of the game, the rules are explained by both Charlotte and Vendetta. The overall objective is to throw pumpkins at Charlotte while she moves around the screen in various costumes. The maximum is 30 and there are different end screens depending on how any pumpkins you throw at Charlotte.

==DVD Releases==
The Season One DVD was first shipped out on December 10, 2004.

The Season Two DVD was first shipped out on December 14, 2005.
In 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010, a message was posted on the front page saying that a fiend was to be temporarily placed in charge of the site. On April Fool&#x27;s Day, the main menu had a bite taken out of it, and the fiend was there to explain that he got hungry and ate some episodes, but fixed them. As a result, the episodes 4, 6, 11, 18, 19, and 20 were replaced with their alternate DVD versions as an April Fool&#x27;s joke.

==Broadcast on TurboNick==
Nickelodeon bought the series and did a successful test run of &quot;Making Fiends&quot; on its Web-based TurboNick. Few restrictions were made by the network execs when they made the deal, they told Amy Winfrey, &quot;Just don&#x27;t mention Hitler, and don&#x27;t hit people on the head&quot;.

Winfrey conceded to a few small changes. For example, a classroom poster that read &quot;A is for Alimony&quot; had to be changed. She was stumped for a while on what A should be for. Aglaia would pop into Winfrey&#x27;s office and suggest things, such as Alcoholism. They settled on &quot;A is for Abomination&quot;.

<doc id="1291577" wikidata="Q169822" url="?curid=1291577" title="Bee pollen">
<text>Bee pollen, also known as bee bread and ambrosia, is a ball or pellet of field-gathered flower pollen packed by worker honeybees, and used as the primary food source for the hive. It consists of simple sugars, protein, minerals and vitamins, fatty acids, and a small percentage of other components. Bee pollen is stored in brood cells, mixed with saliva, and sealed with a drop of honey. Bee pollen is harvested as food for humans and marketed as having various, but yet unproven, health benefits.

==Details==

In honeybees (&quot;Apis&quot; species) pollen is stored in the chambers of the hives. It differs from field-gathered pollen as honeybee secretions induce a fermentation process, where biochemical transformations break down the walls of flower pollen grains and render the nutrients more readily available.

Forager bees that gather pollen do not eat it themselves, since they stop producing the proteolytic enzymes necessary to digest it when they transition to foraging. The foragers unload the pollen they gather directly into open cells located at the interface between the brood and stored honey, creating a typical band of what is called bee bread – the substance which is the main food source for honeybee larvae and workers.

Foraging bees bring pollen back to the hive, where they pass it off to other worker bees, who pack the pollen into cells with their heads. During collection and possibly packing, the pollen is mixed with nectar and bee salivary secretions, signaling the start of the lactic fermentation process. Bee pollen is the primary source of protein for the hive.

Bees other than &quot;Apis&quot; typically form pollen into balls; these are primarily ground-nesting bees or twig-nesting bees, most of which are solitary, such as leafcutter bees. With the leafcutter bee, as in most such bees, when the pollen ball is complete, the female lays an egg on top of the pollen ball, and seals the brood cell. The egg hatches and the larva consumes the pollen directly; the pollen is not stored separately from the brood. This method of pollen usage can also be seen in the wood-nesting bee species &quot;Xylocopa sulcatipes&quot; and &quot;Xylocopa sonorina&quot;.

==Composition==
Like honey and propolis, other well-known honeybee products that are gathered rather than secreted (i.e., in contrast to royal jelly and beeswax), the exact chemical composition depends on the plants from which the worker bees gather the pollen, and can vary from hour to hour, day to day, week to week, colony to colony, even in the same apiary, with no two samples of bee pollen being exactly identical. Accordingly, chemical and nutritional analyses of bee pollen apply only to the specific samples being tested and cannot be extrapolated to samples gathered in other places or other times.

Although there is no specific chemical composition, the average composition is said to be 40–60% simple sugars (fructose and glucose), 20–60% proteins, 3% minerals and vitamins, 1–32% fatty acids, and 5% diverse other components. Bee bread is a niche for yeasts and bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria, &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot;, &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp., and others. A study of bee pollen samples showed that they may contain 188 kinds of fungi and 29 kinds of bacteria. Despite this microbial diversity, stored pollen is a preservation environment similar to honey, and contains consistently low microbial biomass.

==Use as a health supplement==
Bee pollen has been touted by herbalists as a treatment for a variety of medical conditions. Bee bread is rich in micronutrients, minerals, and phenolic compounds.

Potential risks of consuming bee pollen include contamination by fungal mycotoxins, pesticides, or toxic metals. Bee pollen is safe for short term use, but for those with pollen allergies, allergic reactions may occur (shortness of breath, hives, swelling, and anaphylaxis). Bee pollen is not safe for pregnant people and should not be used during breastfeeding. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against the use of some bee pollen products because they are adulterated with unapproved drugs including sibutramine and phenolphthalein.

== Alternative diets for honeybees ==
There are several artificial pollen diets available for honeybees that incorporate a variety of ingredients like soy, corn gluten, yeast, egg, or milk protein, but they often fail to provide the essential macronutrients (such as lipids and proteins), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), and antioxidants needed by honeybees to thrive.

<doc id="1291578" wikidata="Q5545908" url="?curid=1291578" title="George Washington's Farewell Address">
<text>Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address is a letter written by President George Washington as a valedictory to &quot;friends and fellow-citizens&quot; after 20 years of public service to the United States. He wrote it near the end of the second term of his presidency before retiring to his home at Mount Vernon in Virginia.

The letter was first published as The Address of Gen. Washington to the People of America on His Declining the Presidency of the United States in &quot;Claypoole&#x27;s American Daily Advertiser&quot; on September 19, 1796, about ten weeks before the presidential electors cast their votes in the 1796 election. In it, he writes about the importance of national unity while warning Americans of the political dangers of regionalism, partisanship and foreign influence, which they must avoid to remain true to their values. It was almost immediately reprinted in newspapers around the country, and later in pamphlet form.

The first draft was originally prepared by James Madison in June 1792, as Washington contemplated retiring at the end of his first term in office. However, he set it aside and ran for a second term because of heated disputes between Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson which convinced Washington that the growing tensions would rip apart the country without his leadership. This included the state of foreign affairs, and divisions between the newly formed Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties.

As his second term came to a close four years later, Washington prepared a revision of the original letter with the help of Hamilton to write a new farewell address to announce his intention to decline a third term in office. He reflects on the emerging issues of the American political landscape in 1796, expresses his support for the government eight years after the adoption of the Constitution, defends his administration&#x27;s record, and gives valedictory advice to the American people. The letter also attempted to reunite the country, which had partly turned against Washington following the controversial 1794 Jay Treaty.

== Summary ==

The thought of the United States without George Washington as its president caused concern among many Americans. Thomas Jefferson disagreed with many of Washington&#x27;s policies and later led the Democratic-Republicans in opposition to many Federalist policies, but he joined his political rival Alexander Hamilton, leader of the Federalists, in convincing Washington to delay his retirement and serve a second term. The two men feared that the nation would be torn apart without his leadership. Washington most likely referred to this when he told the American people that he had wanted to retire before the last election, but he was convinced by people who were, in his words, &quot;entitled to my confidence&quot; that it was his duty to serve a second term. 

All of the ideas presented in Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address came from Washington; however, Alexander Hamilton wrote most of it.

Washington sought to convince the American people that his service was no longer necessary by telling them, as he had in his first inaugural address, that he truly believed that he was never qualified to be president. If he accomplished anything during his presidency, he said, it was as a result of their support and efforts to help the country survive and prosper. Despite his confidence that the country would survive without his leadership, Washington used the majority of the letter to offer advice as a &quot;parting friend&quot; on what he believed were the greatest threats to the nation.

=== Unity and sectionalism ===
The Address expresses Washington&#x27;s understanding of republicanism by affirming popular government and warning about threats to &quot;Republican liberty&quot;. He begins his warnings to the American people by stressing that their independence, peace at home and abroad, safety, prosperity, and liberty are all dependent upon unity among the states. He warns them that the union of states created by the Constitution will come under the most frequent and focused attacks by foreign and domestic enemies of the country. He warns the American people to be suspicious of anyone who seeks to abandon the Union, secede a portion of the country from the rest, or weaken the bonds that hold together the constitutional union. To promote the strength of the Union, he urges the people to place their identity as Americans above their identities as members of a state, city, or region, and to focus their efforts and affection on the country above all other local interests. He reminds the people that they do not have more than slight differences in religion, manners, habits, and political principles and that their triumph and possession of independence and liberty are the results of working together.

Washington continues to express his support of the Union by giving some examples of how he believes that the country, its regions, and its people are already benefiting from the unity which they currently share. He then looks to the future in his belief that the combined effort and resources of its people will protect the country from foreign attack and allow them to avoid wars between neighboring nations that often happen due to rivalries and competing relations with foreign nations. He argues that the security provided by the Union will also allow the United States to avoid the creation of an overgrown military which he sees as a great threat to liberty, especially the republican liberty that the United States has created.

Washington goes on to warn the American people to question the ulterior motives of any person or group who argues that the land within the borders of the United States is too large to be ruled as a republic, an argument made by many during the debate on the proposed purchase of the Louisiana Territory, calling on the people to give the experiment of a large republic a chance to work before deciding that it cannot be done. He then offers strong warnings on the dangers of sectionalism, arguing that the true motives of a sectionalist are to create distrust or rivalries between regions and people to gain power and take control of the government. Washington points to the Jay Treaty and Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty which established the borders of the United States western territories between Spanish Mexico and British Canada and secured the rights of western farmers to ship goods along the Mississippi River to New Orleans. He holds up these treaties as proof that the eastern states along the Atlantic Coast and the federal government are looking out for the welfare of all the American people and can win fair treatment from foreign countries as a united nation.

=== Constitution and political factions ===

Washington goes on to state his support for the new constitutional government, calling it an improvement upon the nation&#x27;s original attempt in the Articles of Confederation. He reminds the people that it is the right of the people to alter the government to meet their needs, but it should only be done through constitutional amendments. He reinforces this belief by arguing that violent takeovers of the government should be avoided at all costs and that it is the duty of every member of the republic to follow the constitution and to submit to the laws of the government until it is constitutionally amended by the majority of the American people.

Washington warns the people that political factions may seek to obstruct the execution of the laws created by the government or to prevent the branches of government from exercising the powers provided to them by the constitution. Such factions may claim to be trying to answer popular demands or solve pressing problems, but their true intentions are to take the power from the people and place it in the hands of unjust men.

Washington calls the American people to only change the Constitution through amendments, but he then warns them that groups seeking to overthrow the government may strive to pass constitutional amendments to weaken the government to a point where it is unable to defend itself from political factions, enforce its laws, and protect the people&#x27;s rights and property. As a result, he urges them to give the government time to realize its full potential, and only amend the constitution after thorough time and thought have proven that it is truly necessary instead of simply making changes based upon opinions and hypotheses of the moment.

=== Political parties ===

Washington continues to advance his idea of the dangers of sectionalism and expands his warning to include the dangers of political parties to the country as a whole. These warnings are given in the context of the recent rise of two opposing parties within the government—the Democratic-Republican Party led by Jefferson, and Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist Party. Washington had striven to remain neutral during a conflict between Britain and France brought about by the French Revolution, while the Democratic-Republicans had made efforts to align with France, and the Federalists had made efforts to ally with Great Britain.

Washington recognizes that it is natural for people to organize and operate within groups such as political parties, but he also argues that every government has recognized political parties as an enemy and has sought to repress them because of their tendency to seek more power than other groups and to take revenge on political opponents. He feels that disagreements between political parties weakened the government.

Moreover, he makes the case that &quot;the alternate domination&quot; of one party over another and coinciding efforts to exact revenge upon their opponents have led to horrible atrocities, and &quot;is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.&quot; From Washington&#x27;s perspective and judgment, political parties eventually and &quot;gradually incline the minds of men to seek security… in the absolute power of an individual&quot;, leading to despotism. He acknowledges the fact that parties are sometimes beneficial in promoting liberty in monarchies, but he argues that political parties must be restrained in a popularly elected government because of their tendency to distract the government from their duties, create unfounded jealousies among groups and regions, raise false alarms among the people, promote riots and insurrection, and provide foreign nations and interests access to the government where they can impose their will upon the country.

=== Checks and balances and separation of powers ===

Washington continues his defense of the Constitution by stating that the system of checks and balances and separation of powers within it are important means of preventing a single person or group from seizing control of the country. He advises the American people that, if they believe that it is necessary to modify the powers granted to the government through the Constitution, it should be done through constitutional amendments instead of through force.

=== Religion, morality and education ===
One of the most referenced parts of Washington&#x27;s letter is his strong support of the importance of religion and morality in promoting private and public happiness and in promoting the political prosperity of the nation. He argues that religious principles promote the protection of property, reputation, life, and honor that are the foundations of justice. He cautions against the belief that the nation&#x27;s morality can be maintained without religion:
Washington refers to religious principle as the foundation of a civilized society. He also argues that the American government needs to ensure &quot;the general diffusion of knowledge&quot; throughout the United States; the government has been created to enforce the opinion of the people, so the opinion of the people should be informed and knowledgeable.

=== Credit and government borrowing ===
Washington provides strong support for the balanced federal budget, arguing that the nation&#x27;s credit is an important source of strength and security. He urges the American people to preserve the national credit by avoiding war, avoiding unnecessary borrowing, and paying off any national debt accumulated in times of war as quickly as possible in times of peace so that future generations do not have to take on the financial burdens. Despite his warnings to avoid taking on debt, Washington does state his belief that sometimes it is necessary to spend money to prevent dangers or wars that will cost more if not properly prepared for. At these times, he argues, it is necessary for the people to cooperate by paying taxes to cover these precautionary expenses. He emphasizes how important it is for the government to be careful in choosing the items that will be taxed, but also tells the American people that, no matter how hard the government tries, there will never be a tax which is not inconvenient and unpleasant to those who must pay it.

=== Foreign relations and free trade ===
Washington dedicates a large part of his farewell address to discussing foreign relations and the dangers of permanent alliances between the United States and foreign nations, which he views as foreign entanglements. He advocates a policy of good faith and justice towards all nations, again making reference to proper behavior based upon religious doctrine and morality. He urges the American people to avoid long-term friendly relations or rivalries with any nation, arguing that attachments with or animosity toward other nations will only cloud the government&#x27;s judgment in its foreign policy. He argues that longstanding poor relations will only lead to unnecessary wars due to a tendency to blow minor offenses out of proportion when committed by nations viewed as enemies of the United States. He continues this argument by claiming that alliances are likely to draw the United States into wars that have no justification and no benefit to the country beyond simply defending the favored nation. Alliances, he warns, often lead to poor relations with nations who feel that they are not being treated as well as America&#x27;s allies, and threaten to influence the American government into making decisions based upon the will of their allies instead of the will of the American people.
Washington makes an extended reference to the dangers of foreign nations who will seek to influence the American people and government; nations who may be considered friendly as well as nations considered enemies will equally try to influence the government to do their will. &quot;Real patriots&quot;, he warns, who &quot;resist the intrigues&quot; of foreign nations may find themselves &quot;suspected and odious&quot; in the eyes of others, yet he urges the people to stand firm against such influences all the same. He portrays those who attempt to further such foreign interests as becoming the &quot;tools and dupes&quot; of those nations, stealing the applause and praise of their country away from the &quot;real patriots&quot; while actually working to &quot;surrender&quot; American interests to foreign nations.

Washington goes on to urge the American people to take advantage of their isolated position in the world, and to avoid attachments and entanglements in foreign affairs, especially those of Europe, which he argues have little or nothing to do with the interests of America. He argues that it makes no sense for the American people to become embroiled in European affairs when their isolated position and unity allow them to remain neutral and focus on their own affairs. He argues that the country should avoid permanent alliances with all foreign nations, although temporary alliances during times of extreme danger may be necessary. He states that current treaties should be honored but not extended.

Washington wraps up his foreign policy stance by advocating free trade with all nations, arguing that trade links should be established naturally and the role of the government should be limited to ensuring stable trade, defending the rights of American merchants and any provisions necessary to ensure the conventional rules of trade.

=== Address&#x27;s intentions ===
Washington uses this portion of the address to explain that he does not expect his advice to make any great impression upon the people or to change the course of American politics, but he does hope that the people will remember his devoted service to his country.

=== Defense of the Proclamation of Neutrality ===
Washington then explains his reasoning behind the Proclamation of Neutrality which he made during the French Revolutionary Wars, despite the standing Treaty of Alliance with France. He explains that the United States had a right to remain neutral in the conflict and that the correctness of that decision &quot;has been virtually admitted by all&quot; nations since. Justice and humanity required him to remain neutral during the conflict, he argues, and the neutrality was also necessary to allow the new government a chance to mature and gain enough strength to control its own affairs.

=== Closing thoughts ===
Washington closes his letter to the American people by asking them to forgive any failures that may have occurred during his service to the country, assuring them that they were due to his weaknesses and by no means intentional. The sentences express his excitement about joining his fellow Americans as a private citizen in the free government they created together during his 45 years of public service.

== Legacy ==

Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address is considered to be one of the most important documents in American history and the foundation of the Federalist Party&#x27;s political doctrine.

Washington later accepted a commission from President John Adams, despite his stated desire to retire from public service, as the Senior Officer of a Provisional Army formed to defend the nation against a possible invasion by French forces during the Quasi-War. Washington held true to his statements in his farewell address, despite spending months organizing the Officer Corps of the Provisional Army, and declined suggestions that he return to public office in the presidential election of 1800.

Washington&#x27;s statements on the importance of religion and morality in American politics and his warnings on the dangers of foreign alliances influenced political debates into the twentieth century, and have received special consideration as advice from an American hero.

=== Alliances with foreign nations ===
Washington&#x27;s hope that the United States would end permanent alliances with foreign nations was realized in 1800 with the Convention of 1800, the Treaty of Mortefontaine which officially ended the 1778 Treaty of Alliance, in exchange for ending the Quasi-War and establishing most favored nation trade relations with Napoleonic France. In 1823, Washington&#x27;s foreign policy goals were further realized in the Monroe Doctrine, which promised non-interference in European affairs so long as the nations of Europe did not seek to colonize or interfere with the newly independent Latin American nations of Central and South America. The United States did not enter into any permanent military alliances with foreign nations until the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty which formed NATO.

=== Reading in Congress ===
Philadelphia residents signed a petition in January 1862 during the American Civil War requesting that Congress commemorate the 130th anniversary of Washington&#x27;s birth by reading his Farewell Address &quot;in one or the other of the Houses of Congress.&quot; It was first read in the House of Representatives in February 1862, and reading Washington&#x27;s address became a tradition in both houses by 1899. The House of Representatives abandoned the practice in 1984, but the Senate continues the tradition. Washington&#x27;s Birthday is observed by selecting a member of the Senate to read the address aloud on the Senate floor, alternating between political parties each year since 1896. Additionally, some senators may choose to make brief remarks and commentary before reading the speech. After finishing, readers make an entry into a black, leather-bound journal maintained by the Secretary of the Senate upon finishing.

During Strom Thurmond&#x27;s filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address was read by Strom Thurmond.

=== In American national mythology ===
According to political journalist John Avlon, the Farewell Address was &quot;once celebrated as a civic Scripture, more widely reprinted than the Declaration of Independence&quot; but adds that it &quot;is now almost forgotten.&quot; He suggested that it had long been &quot;eclipsed in the national memory&quot; until the Broadway musical &quot;Hamilton&quot; brought it back to popular awareness in the song &quot;One Last Time&quot;, where lines are sung by Washington and Hamilton from the end of the Address.

<doc id="1291587" wikidata="Q1046841" url="?curid=1291587" title="Vanity Fair (2004 film)">
<text>Vanity Fair is a 2004 historical drama film directed by Mira Nair and adapted from William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s 1848 novel of the same name. The novel has been the subject of numerous television and film adaptations. Nair&#x27;s version made notable changes in the development of the main character Becky Sharp, played by Reese Witherspoon.

The film received several awards and nominations, including being nominated for the Golden Lion at the 2004 Venice Film Festival.

==Plot==
In 1802 UK, Becky Sharp, the orphaned daughter of a poor painter, has finished her studies and offered to be a governess to Sir Pitt Crawley&#x27;s daughters. Before starting, she travels to London with her close friend Amelia Sedley and her family. While there she begins a campaign to charm Amelia&#x27;s awkward and overweight brother &quot;Jos&quot; Sedley, a wealthy trader living in India. Smitten with Becky, he almost proposes, but is dissuaded by Amelia&#x27;s snobbish fiancé George Osborne, reminding him that Becky has no dowry.

Not finding a rich husband, Becky takes up her post. Horrified by the house and her employer Sir Pitt, she diligently teaches his daughters and prepares the house for his half-sister Miss Crawley. His youngest son, Rawdon Crawley, an army captain, comes with them and immediately fancies Becky. She manages to secure a post with ill-tempered Miss Crawley.

Meanwhile, Amelia&#x27;s prospective father-in-law, Mr. Osborne, is trying to arrange a more advantageous marriage for his son George. When George refuses to consider her, Mr. Osborne bankrupts Mr. Sedley, forcing George to break his engagement to Amelia. She now lives in squalor with her family but is hopeful he will come for her, believing the gift of a piano from George&#x27;s friend Dobbin is from George himself.

Rawdon Crawley and Becky marry secretly, but Miss Crawley soon finds out expelling her from her house and disinheriting Rawdon. George Osborne marries Amelia, rebelling against his father, and is soon after deployed with Dobbin and Rawdon to Belgium, as Napoleon escaped Elba and returned to France. Becky and Amelia accompany their husbands. The newly-wedded Osborne tires of Amelia, and hits on Becky. The ball they are attending is interrupted by an announcement that Napoleon has attacked, and they must march in three hours. Before leaving, Rawdon gives Becky all he&#x27;s won at cards. The next day, as she tries to flee the city, she sees Amelia in the mob and leaves her carriage to be with her in Brussels, waiting out the battle.

In the ensuing Battle of Waterloo, George is killed and Rawdon survives. Amelia bears his son, also named George. Mr. Osborne refuses to acknowledge his grandson, so Amelia returns to live in poverty with her parents. Now-Major William Dobbin, young George&#x27;s godfather, continues to show his love for the widowed Amelia by small kindnesses. She is too in love with George&#x27;s memory to return Dobbin&#x27;s affections. Saddened, he transfers to an army post in India. Meanwhile, Becky&#x27;s son is also named after his father.

Several years pass. Rawdon has been passed over for inheritance by both his aunt and father, and they are sinking deep into debt. Amelia struggles to raise her son and reluctantly gives him up to be raised by his grandfather Mr. Osborne, for a fine education and lifestyle. Bailiffs arrive to repossess the Crawleys&#x27; furniture, but Becky is saved by their neighbor Lord Steyne, who she remembers from the past as a keen buyer of her father&#x27;s paintings. He becomes her patron, giving her money and introducing her to London high society.

On the night of her triumphant presentation to King George IV, Becky receives word that Rawdon has been arrested and thrown into debtors&#x27; prison. Lord Steyne insists she spends the night with him in return for the services he has rendered her, and Rawdon, after being bailed out by his sister-in-law, walks in on Steyne forcing himself upon Becky. He throws him out but realizes Becky has been taking money for months in secret without sharing it with him. He leaves her, entrusting the care of their son to his older brother, the new Sir Pitt, and his wife.

Twelve years later, Becky is a card dealer at a casino in Baden-Baden, Germany. Rawdon died from malaria soon after leaving her, while posted to a tropical island by Lord Steyne. She comes across Amelia&#x27;s grown son George Jr., who invites her to tea with his mother. Mr. Osborne finally accepted Amelia, leaving her and George Jr. with a large inheritance. Becky confronts Amelia over her obsession with the late George, showing her a love note from him many years earlier. She urges Amelia to love Dobbin, who has been loyal for many years. Although at first angered, Amelia realizes her mistake and declares her love to Dobbin.

Alone again in the casino, Becky meets Jos Sedley, who has come to Germany after Amelia tells him Becky was there. He invites her to live in India with him, and she delightedly accepts. They depart to make a new life for themselves.

==Production==
The film adaptation of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; had been in development for over 10 years, with writers Matthew Faulk and Mark Skeet working on the screenplay. Mira Nair became attached to the project in 2002 and scrapped most of the initial screenplay. She brought Julian Fellowes in to rewrite the film; he agreed with her that the character of Becky Sharp should be made more sympathetic than in the novel. The ending was also changed, with Becky journeying to India with Joseph Sedley. The film had a budget of $23 million and originally was supposed to be in pre-production for 18 weeks. However, Reese Witherspoon became pregnant so it was necessary to speed up both pre-production and filming. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was shot in Bath, Kent, the Chatham Dockyard, and at Stanway House in Gloucestershire.

Robert Pattinson initially had a small but important role as the grown-up son of Becky Sharp. He later revealed that he discovered his scenes were cut during the premiere screening.

==Reception==
Critics gave the film mixed reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 51% based on 167 reviews, and an average rating of 5.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A more likable Becky Sharp makes for a less interesting movie.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave a positive review, calling the movie &quot;Mira Nair&#x27;s fine movie version of the 1848 book, in all its glory and scope and wit.&quot; In the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot;, Lawrence Toppman commented that &quot;The filmmakers have wisely retained the main structure of the book&quot; and that &quot;The cast is uniformly good, even when dealing with sudden mood changes forced by the screenwriters&#x27; need to move forward.&quot;

Meanwhile, Lisa Schwarzbaum, in her review in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, rated the film a B−, and added that &quot;The dismaying switcheroo in director Mira Nair&#x27;s adaptation [...] that Botoxes Thackeray’s riotous, unruly masterpiece, is that this &#x27;Vanity Fair&#x27; is, indeed, genteel and inoffensive. In fact, it borders on perky – a duller, safer tonal choice for the story of a conniving go-getter whose fall is as precipitous as her rise.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
Mira Nair, the director of the film, searched for good Indian musicians to compose a song for the album, and finally selected the trio Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy at the last minute. She showed them a rough footage of the situation she wanted them to compose for, which was the last few sequences of the film. The trio used tabla and several other Indian musical instruments for the song, without any synth, to give it an ethnic feel. The song was sung by Shankar, accompanied by Richa Sharma and Jerry McCulley of &quot;Celtic Instruments&quot; described the song as &quot;a sprightly duet&quot;, while &quot;SoundtrackNet&quot; said the &quot;aforementioned upbeat vocal number &quot;Gori Re&quot;&quot; is enjoyable in its own way for one who enjoys Indian musical styles.

<text>Tenebrism, from Italian (&#x27;dark, gloomy, mysterious&#x27;), also occasionally called dramatic illumination, is a style of painting using especially pronounced chiaroscuro, where there are violent contrasts of light and dark, and where darkness becomes a dominating feature of the image. The technique was developed to add drama to an image through a spotlight effect, and is common in Baroque paintings. Tenebrism is used only to obtain a dramatic impact while chiaroscuro is a broader term, also covering the use of less extreme contrasts of light to enhance the illusion of three-dimensionality.

==Baroque== 

The artist Caravaggio is generally credited with the invention of the style, although this technique was also used by earlier artists such as Albrecht Dürer in his several self portraits; by Tintoretto in his dramatic religious paintings, such as The Miracle of St Mark; by El Greco, who painted three versions of a composition with a boy, a man, and a monkey grouped in darkness around a single flame; and lesser known painters such as Adam Elsheimer, who painted night-scenes with a restricted lighted areas. The term is usually applied to artists from the 17th century onward.

Among the best known tenebrist artists are Italian, Dutch and Spanish followers of Caravaggio. These include the Italian Baroque follower of Caravaggio, Artemisia Gentileschi, who was an outstanding exponent of tenebrism. Other exponents include the Dutch painters of the Utrecht School and the Spanish painters Francisco Ribalta, Jusepe de Ribera, and their followers, with the term most often being applied to these painters.
Tenebrism is sometimes applied to other 17th-century painters in what has been called the &quot;candlelight tradition&quot;. These include Georges de La Tour, who painted many works illuminated with a single candle, Trophime Bigot, Gerrit van Honthorst, and Rembrandt. In Flanders Adam de Coster was recognized as a leading tenebrist who excelled in scenes in which a single candle has its light blocked by an object. The Dutch artist Godfried Schalcken painted many candle-lit scenes. The northern painters (but not always Rembrandt) often achieved a mood of stillness and tranquility through their extreme lighting, rather the reverse of the impression that Spanish painters intended. They are typically as interested in the very dimly-lit areas of the painting as the spot-lit ones, and their light diffuses gently across much of the picture area.

==Later development==
Later, similar compositions were painted by Joseph Wright of Derby and other artists of the Romantic Movement, but the term is rarely used to characterize their work in general.

<text>Porky&#x27;s Badtime Story is a 1937 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon directed by Robert Clampett (his first short as director) and an uncredited Chuck Jones. The short was released on July 24, 1937, and stars Porky Pig and Gabby Goat. The short was later remade as &quot;Tick Tock Tuckered&quot; (1944), with Daffy Duck taking Gabby&#x27;s role.

Despite being the first cartoon directed by Bob Clampett, the short could have been started by Ub Iwerks (with the first two, &quot;Porky and Gabby&quot; and &quot;Porky&#x27;s Super Service&quot; fully completed by Iwerks) and finished by Clampett, alongside &quot;Get Rich Quick Porky&quot;. Clampett would direct &quot;Rover&#x27;s Rival&quot; without any involvement with Iwerks, which would go on to release later that year.

==Plot==
When Porky Pig and Gabby Goat realize that they overslept to 10:00 after their alarm goes off at 06:00, they end up rushing to work at Peter Piper Pickled Peppers and sneaking in. When clocking in, Gabby tries to pull the lever, but ends up struggling and the clock goes crazy. Their boss catches them and initially states in a friendly tone that if they weren&#x27;t going to make it, he would have sent their work to them. The boss then drops the friendly act and gets furious, warning them that if they are late one more time, they are fired. The boss then orders them to get to work, to which they dash into their office and close the door so fast that the sign on the door shatters.

At 08:00 that night after returning home from work and dealing with their irate boss, Porky sets the alarm clock as Gabby complains about having to go to bed early. Porky reminds Gabby about their boss&#x27; threat that if they are late again, they will be fired. Porky climbs into bed, and they both fall asleep until a bunch of cats next door wake them up; and later a fly bugs them, literally. Later that night, the moon comes out and its light wakes up Porky. One of Porky&#x27;s attempts to close the window ends up wrecking his bed. As the night progresses, a thunderstorm occurs while Porky is sleeping in Gabby&#x27;s bed. A leak in the roof disturbs Gabby, who then opens an umbrella in the house with Porky telling him that it&#x27;s bad luck. Gabby ignores Porky&#x27;s statement until lightning destroys the umbrella. When Gabby quips that he should try sleeping under Niagara Falls, a lot of water comes through the roof and down on them.

The next morning, Porky and Gabby are shown sleeping in the drawers when the alarm clock goes off at 06:00. They get themselves ready and drive off to work to make sure their jobs stay safe from termination. When Porky and Gabby arrive at Peter Piper Pickled Peppers, they see a sign on the door that says &quot;Closed Sunday&quot;, revealing that their workplace is closed for the day. Porky and Gabby drive home, and when they climb back into the drawers to sleep, the alarm clock goes off again at 06:15 and Porky hits it with a mallet, leaving the clock dazed.

== Legacy ==
Bob Clampett later directed a remake of the short as &quot;Tick Tock Tuckered&quot; (1944), with Daffy Duck taking Gabby&#x27;s role.

<doc id="1291594" wikidata="Q2915444" url="?curid=1291594" title="Fantasmic!">
<text>Fantasmic! is a nighttime show at Disneyland and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios. The show formerly operated at Tokyo DisneySea. It features fireworks, characters, live actors, water effects, pyrotechnics, lasers, music, audio-animatronics, searchlights, decorated boat floats, and mist screen projections. The narrative of &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; is a voyage through Mickey Mouse&#x27;s imagination that culminates in a battle against the Disney Villains.

&quot;Fantasmic!&quot; originated at Disneyland in 1992 after Walt Disney Creative Entertainment was asked to create a nighttime spectacular involving water and fireworks to reinvigorate the space in front of the Rivers of America. The area was reworked, including terracing the walkways to accommodate viewing and modifying part of Tom Sawyer Island to allow the show&#x27;s staged live action segments. The producers employed the resources of Walt Disney Imagineering and Walt Disney Animation Studios.

A second version featuring new scenes opened at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in 1998, and a third version premiered at Tokyo DisneySea in 2011, replacing &quot;BraviSEAmo!&quot;. An updated version of Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; debuted in 2017, featuring a re-recorded soundtrack in addition to new scenes, lighting, choreography and costumes. A third version premiered at Disneyland in 2022 with new clouded lasers and searchlights in the viewing area. A revamped version premiered at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in 2022 with new scenes and special effects. After a fire destroyed the animatronic dragon in April 2023, a fourth version premiered at Disneyland in May 2024 with a new Maleficent and Sorcerer Mickey battle sequence.

==Disneyland version==
&quot;Fantasmic!&quot; takes place on the waters of the Rivers of America at Disneyland and on a stage across the waterway on Tom Sawyer Island.

===Synopsis (since 2024)===
The show begins with Mickey Mouse being transported into his dream. He dances and orchestrates various water fountain, pyrotechnic, projection, laser and lighting effects to the show&#x27;s theme. Mist screens rise from the water, acting as projection surfaces for various scenes from Disney movies. The show then transitions into a jungle scene from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, featuring a puppet of Kaa and three floating barges carrying King Louie and black-lit monkeys (that debuted in the Tokyo version) across the river stage. The song transitions into &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot;. The music then segues into a dubstep rendition of &quot;Pink Elephants on Parade&quot; from &quot;Dumbo&quot;, as animated pink elephants appear onscreen and in the form of performers on the island. The scene then transitions to &quot;Friend Like Me&quot; from &quot;Aladdin&quot;. Sorcerer Mickey watches the Genie perform tricks. Then they go under the sea as they head into the world of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. A bubble floats by and Jiminy Cricket appears onscreen, searching underwater for Pinocchio. An animated Monstro appears suddenly, accompanied by a heavy musical score as he crashes through water. The sea morphs into the &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; flood scene. As Mickey looks around in the dark and asks &quot;What&#x27;s going on?&quot;, a ship caught in a storm appears.

A cannon is fired from Sailing Ship &quot;Columbia&quot;, portraying itself as the Jolly Roger. The Lost Boys and the pirates participate in a stunt sequence with Peter Pan, Wendy Darling, Captain Hook and Mr. Smee and it ends with the fountains that projecting the crocodile chasing Hook away. As the scene concludes, Tinker Bell draws the moon, with projections of Prince Naveen, Tiana, Prince Philip, Aurora, Snow White and the prince. The projections turn to clouds as Aladdin and Jasmine are on the stage while a rendition of &quot;A Whole New World&quot; plays. Then three small barges arrive carrying Belle and the Beast, Ariel and Prince Eric, and Rapunzel and Flynn Rider, with the accompanying signature melody from each film — &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Part of Your World&quot;, and &quot;I See the Light&quot;.

Mickey&#x27;s dream takes a turn for the worse. The magic mirror appears onscreen and tempts Mickey to enter the darker realms of his imagination. When asked if he has the courage, Mickey accepts the challenge, and the mirror traps Mickey inside. The Evil Queen calls all the villains to partake in Mickey&#x27;s nightmare, invoking a riled Ursula who joins the Queen&#x27;s plot to destroy Mickey. Ursula calls upon Chernabog, who summons deceased spirits. Chernabog then summons Maleficent, who threatens Sorcerer Mickey as she rises from the pillar. Onstage, Maleficent sets the waters ablaze, summoning fire onto the river. Mickey defeats Maleficent, destroying the villains in the process.

Tink reappears with the &quot;Mark Twain&quot; Riverboat approaching with fireworks, and a black-and-white Mickey from &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; appears. Mickey then appears again to conduct a final set of fireworks and water fountains before leaving in a bright blast of fireworks.

====Development====
The original Disneyland soft opening and press premiere were scheduled to begin on Wednesday, April 29, 1992, and continue through the weekend. By late afternoon, rioting began in Los Angeles following the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers involved in the Rodney King beating. Promotional materials with the catchphrase &quot;Be There When the Night Ignites&quot; were quickly pulled from public circulation.

====Refurbishments====
Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; has undergone several technical refreshes. A new sound system debuted in the summer of 2007, along with new show barges featuring LED lighting arrays. A complete overhaul of the lighting system debuted in the spring of 2008. The three mainland lighting towers, which rise hydraulically from pits in the ground prior to the show, were rebuilt with pull-out slides for the new Clay Paky Alpha Spots and Washes and redesigned for the new Strong Gladiator IV followspots. The footlights on the mainland side at water level were replaced with LED fixtures. Refurbished pyrotechnic barges were given new technologies derived from Disneyland&#x27;s Air-Launch Firework (ALF) system.

In 2008, the three original 70mm projectors were replaced with high definition (HD) digital projectors. A new audio-animatronic dragon (nicknamed Murphy by fans, after Murphy&#x27;s law, when the dragon experienced multiple delays in 2009) was built to replace the previous dragon which had been a mechanical dragon&#x27;s head mounted to the top of a Genie boom lift where the man basket used to go and two wing assemblies that were raised up and were flapped manually with poles. The new dragon was designed to be a full-bodied replica of Maleficent&#x27;s final form in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, standing at 45 feet tall.

In early February 2010, the entire Rivers of America were drained. Both the &quot;Mark Twain&quot; and the Sailing Ship &quot;Columbia&quot; were refurbished, and the track along which the ships travel was replaced. The show&#x27;s underwater effects underwent maintenance as well, and the laser effects for the finale were upgraded. On August 28, the second-generation dragon broke again, partly collapsing during a performance. It was restored to the show on November 12.

&quot;Fantasmic!&quot; and other attractions were closed on January 11, 2016, due to the construction of &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge. It reopened on July 15, 2017. This version features some scenes that are inspired by the defunct Tokyo DisneySea version of &quot;Fantasmic!&quot;, along with the &quot;Imagination&quot; song as part of the post-show. The show was remastered, featuring a new sequence with segments from &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Tangled&quot;.

In December 2023, Disneyland announced that the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; segment would revert to the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; segment.

===2023 fire incident===

On April 22, 2023, during the performance of the show, the audio-animatronic Maleficent dragon caught fire. It became engulfed in flames which resulted in its destruction. The Frontierland area was evacuated, with no injuries being reported according to the Anaheim Fire Department. The show returned in 2024 without the audio-animatronic dragon.

==Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios version==
===Synopsis (since 2022)===

The Florida version of the event and show takes place at the Hollywood Hills Amphitheater, with a rocky mountain and a façade of trees serving as the setting. The narrative of the Walt Disney World version is fairly similar to that of Disneyland&#x27;s original version and defunct Tokyo DisneySea version, with the show&#x27;s introduction and conclusion nearly identical. However, there are some notable differences throughout the rest of the show.
* The &quot;Fantasia&quot; sequence at the beginning of the show transitions into a scene from &quot;The Lion King&quot; only.
* The &quot;Dumbo&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Little Mermaid&quot;, and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; sequences are replaced with a segment containing a bubble montage of Disney animated films being presented on the mist screens that includes &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Tangled&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, and &quot;Frozen&quot;.
* The &quot;Peter Pan&quot; segment is replaced with a medley of Disney heroes and heroines, featuring onstage appearances of Pocahontas, Mulan, Aladdin, Elsa, and Moana. From 1998 to 2020, the original show instead featured an onstage battle scene from &quot;Pocahontas&quot; during the entirety of this act.
* Snow White and the Prince still appear in the princess segment, dancing to &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;, instead of Rapunzel and Flynn.
* Scenes of Evil Queen that summons the Magic Mirror and her transformation as Old Hag, which was appeared at the original Disneyland version, is being retained in the Florida version.
* The climax features more villains than in the Disneyland version. In addition to the Evil Queen, Ursula, Chernabog, and Maleficent, Cruella de Vil from &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, Scar from &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Frollo from &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, Jafar from &quot;Aladdin&quot; and Hades from &quot;Hercules&quot; also appear. 
* The battle between Mickey and the villains, as well as their subsequent defeat, is no longer in the Florida version.
* Mickey appears in his &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot; attire and uses the sword to defeat Maleficent, in her dragon form.
* Instead of the &quot;Mark Twain&quot; Riverboat, the characters appear on board the &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; during the finale.

===Hollywood Hills Amphitheater===

Hollywood Hills Amphitheater is a purpose-built seat riverside amphitheatre at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios located at the Walt Disney World Resort, in Florida, that showcases the nighttime spectacular &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; It is located off of Sunset Boulevard, between &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror and the Theater of the Stars, where the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; stage show takes place. The &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; stage in Florida is significantly larger than Disneyland&#x27;s, featuring a man-made, mountain on which Sorcerer Mickey stands and from which the dragon emerges. The amphitheater has 6,900 seats, with room for an additional 3,000 people standing. The moat around the island itself can hold of water.

Pop Secret became the official sponsor of &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios. Prior to this, &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; was the only nighttime fireworks show at Walt Disney World without a sponsor, with &quot;&quot; gaining sponsorship from Pandora Jewelry in 2014, while was sponsored by General Electric from 1999 to 2003 and sponsored by Siemens from 2005 until 2017.

==== Refurbishments ====
In March 2020, this version of &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Walt Disney World reopened it in July with the lagoon drained. &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; reopened a short time later.

The show was later remastered in 2022 featuring a new heroics sequence with segments from &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Moana&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot;. The duration is twenty-nine minutes long.

===Alternate show: &quot;Taste of Fantasmic!&quot;===
The Florida version has a four-minute-long substitute show that plays when inclement weather prohibits the presentation of the regular show. The alternative show does not showcase any of the performers, floats, or puppets due to the dangerous conditions that are posed to the performers because of the possibility of rain accumulating on the stage. Instead the ancillary show is a brief summation of the conventional show; including a fountain display synchronized to &quot;Little April Shower&quot;, a sequence integrating the &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; music, and a finale orchestrated with all of the usual pyrotechnics and musical fanfare from the original show&#x27;s conclusion.

==Tokyo DisneySea version==

&quot;Fantasmic!&quot; debuted at Tokyo DisneySea on April 28, 2011, replacing the &quot;BraviSEAmo!&quot; show in the Mediterranean Harbor. The show was originally planned to debut on April 23 with the park&#x27;s 10th Anniversary &quot;Be Magical!&quot; celebration, but was delayed by the Great East Japan Earthquake in the previous month. Originally, Fantasmic! was planned in 2001 for the park and the story would be themed around Tokyo DisneySea but was scrapped and instead DisneySea Symphony debuted. It is said that of the barges were reused from Tokyo DisneySea&#x27;s former nighttime Christmas show &quot;Candelight Reflections&quot;, but were reimagined. The Christmas tree barge was used for Mickey&#x27;s sorcerer hat. This barge would also be used for Tokyo DisneySea&#x27;s former nighttime Christmas show &quot;Colors of Christmas&quot; (2012–2019). While it hasn&#x27;t been confirmed, one could assume this could be true if you study the barge bases very carefully. Also, the natural gas line in the harbor and 5 water cannons originally used for BraviSEAmo! were also repurposed. Many don&#x27;t know that the natural gas line was installed during the construction of the park for the original planned version of Fantasmic! that would’ve debuted in 2001.

The show&#x27;s score was recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, composed by Don L. Harper, featuring Bruce Healey&#x27;s theme from the original &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; at the US parks. The DisneySea version has new scenes and narrative elements, including scenes based on &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and the original new song &quot;Imagination&quot;. This is the only version of &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; to not have a stationary stage, with the show taking place entirely on barges. All of the characters&#x27; dialogue and sung parts were recorded in Japanese by the characters&#x27; respective Japanese voice artists.

This version of Fantasmic! was directed by Steven Davidson and because of this, he implemented technologies used in Disney California Adventure&#x27;s World of Color nighttime spectacular. 5 of the 6 barges were equipped with World of Color-style water fountains. One central, underwater water screen nozzle was installed under the harbor, as well as the 4 moving barges were equipped with water screens as well. This created that large-style water screen used in World of Color. The show itself seems like a hybrid version of Fantasmic! and World of Color. This concept would later be used in some form for Disneyland&#x27;s renewal version in 2017 as it drew lots of inspiration from Tokyo DisneySea&#x27;s version.

This version of &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; closed on February 29, 2020. It was originally scheduled to conclude its run on March 25 and then close on March 26, but was moved up due to the extended closure of Tokyo Disney Resort in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

Sometime in late March 2020, guests staying at the Hotel MiraCosta spotted all the barges out in Mediterranean Harbor in the late morning/afternoon. The entertainment department decided to do a full run through of the show in broad daylight without any performers. This was most likely done to allow barge drivers a final chance to perform their routines before retiring the show completely.

Fantasmic! was replaced by an all-new nighttime spectacular called &quot;Believe! Sea of Dreams&quot;, debuting on November 11, 2022.

A few months after the end of Fantasmic!, the former hat barge was lifted out of the water and placed on a small area of the original dry dock (behind Soaring A Fantastic Flight show building). The hat itself was dismantled, along with old equipment. The base was then refurbished for its new role in Believe! Sea of Dreams.

=== Future/Potential Paris version ===
In late September 2020, the &quot;Fantasmic!&quot; barges were spotted backstage in dry dock at Tokyo DisneySea. While it was thought that they would all be dismantled, in February 2021, it was discovered that Disneyland Paris had purchased a few of the barges for a future version of Fantasmic! or other nighttime show on the future Adventure Bay over at Disney Adventure World. Sometime in late 2020, early 2021, the barges were shipped to Paris. It was confirmed that the 4 main barges that circle the harbor were shipped to Paris and have since then been housed in a backstage parade warehouse until they can be lowered into the backstage marina of Adventure Bay. It has also been confirmed that Tokyo did not sell the magic mirror/dragon barge. Tokyo also did not sell Paris the “Sorcerer Apprentice’s Hat” barge to Paris as they wanted to repurpose the barge base itself for the “Second Star to the Right” barge that is used in Believe! Sea of Dreams.

The soundtrack for the original Disneyland show was included in the 2015 release of &quot;Walt Disney Records The Legacy Collection: Disneyland&quot;.

<doc id="1291598" wikidata="Q859266" url="?curid=1291598" title="List of best-selling music artists">
<text>The following list of best-selling music artists includes musical artists from the 20th century to the present with claims of 75 million or more record sales worldwide. The sales figures are calculated based on the formula detailed below.

The tables are listed with each artist&#x27;s claimed sales figure(s) and their total independently certified units and are ranked in descending order by claimed sales. If two or more artists have the same claimed sales, they are then ranked by certified units. The claimed sales figure and the total of certified units (for each country) within the provided sources include sales of albums, singles, compilation-albums, music videos as well as downloads of singles and full-length albums. Sales figures, such as those from SoundScan, which are sometimes published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, have not been included in the certified units column.

==Definitions==

Gold/Platinum certifications issued after 2016, especially on singles, are in some cases more than 50% streaming generated. Some of the 20th century artists can also have significant amount of streaming based certifications. The certified units of the newer artists may sometimes be higher than their listed claimed figures. This is because Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and almost all other certifying bodies count streaming towards Gold and Platinum thresholds required for Digital Single Award certification. For this reason, some singles and even albums get over certified by hundreds of thousands of units. The over certified figures, however, are often in millions of units for RIAA certifications, one such example is Rihanna&#x27;s single &quot;We Found Love&quot;, which is certified at nine times Platinum by the RIAA, yet during the time of the certification, it had sold 5.4 million downloads.

The certified units for some artists/bands who have multi-disc albums can be higher than their listed claimed figures due to the RIAA counting each unit within a set as one unit toward certification. The certified units also can be inflated by the redundancy of certifications, because each of tracks downloads and streams contributed to the certifications of both of the single and the respective album. The RIAA counts 10 downloads of individual track as well as 1,500 audio/video streams as an equivalent to one unit of album, including those from singles released prior to the album release. Theoretically, if one song were streamed 1.5 billion times on YouTube, the single would receive Diamond and the whole album could be certified Platinum, thus creating a combined total of 11 million certified units without any sales. Kanye West&#x27;s album &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot; achieved Platinum without selling a single copy and was only available for streaming.

Issued certifications for songs which have been recorded by multiple artists including featured artists are added to each artist&#x27;s total amount of certified units, as all the artists would have played a significant part in a song. For example, &quot;This Is What You Came For&quot; and &quot;Where Them Girls At&quot; include Rihanna and Flo Rida, Nicki Minaj as featured artists respectively, so the certifications issued for these songs are added to the total amount of certified units for all involved artists. However, the certifications issued for songs that have been recorded by four or more artists are not included as the artists involved would have played minor roles, examples of such songs are Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Monster&quot; and/or &quot;All Day&quot;.

===Standards===
* The figures of total certified units within the tables below are based on certified units of albums, singles (including digital downloads) and videos.
* Markets&#x27; order within the tables is based on &quot;Retail Value&quot;: each market generates respectively, the largest market at the top and smallest at the bottom.
* The column for certified sales includes markets, the databases of which contain certifications representing figures of 100,000 and more.

<text>Brian O&#x27;Doherty (4 May 1928 – 7 November 2022) was an Irish-American art critic, writer, visual artist, and academic. He lived in New York City for over 50 years, serving as an art critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and NBC, as well as an editor for &quot;Art in America&quot;. He used a number of alter egos, including Patrick Ireland.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Doherty was born at Ballaghaderreen in County Roscommon in 1928, and grew up in Dublin. He studied medicine at University College Dublin, and did post-graduate work at Cambridge University and at the Harvard School of Public Health.

In 1957, O&#x27;Doherty spent a year working in a cancer hospital before devoting himself full-time to the visual arts. Speaking of his experience after Harvard:

==Career==
In the 1960s, O&#x27;Doherty was an art critic for the &quot;New York Times.&quot; He commissioned Roland Barthes to write his &quot;Death of the Author&quot; essay for a special edition of &quot;Aspen&quot; magazine in 1967. He was also an editor of &quot;Art in America&quot; and an on-air art critic for NBC.

In his mid-career, O&#x27;Doherty began signing his work under the name &quot;Patrick Ireland&quot; in reaction to the Bloody Sunday killings in Derry in 1972. 
For many years, O&#x27;Doherty was an influential member of the senior staff of the National Endowment for the Arts; first as director of the Visual Arts Program, and subsequently as director of the Media Arts Program, where he was responsible for the creation of such major public television series as &quot;American Masters&quot; and &quot;Great Performances&quot;.

He authored numerous works of art criticism, including his books &quot;American Masters&quot; (1973) and &quot;Inside the White Cube: The Ideology of the Gallery Space&quot; (1976), a series of essays first published in &quot;Artforum&quot;. In the latter book, he discusses and invents the term for the contemporary gallery space. He also wrote novels: &quot;The Strange Case of Mademoiselle P.&quot; (1992), the 2000 Booker Prize-nominated &quot;The Deposition of Father McGreevy&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Crossdresser&#x27;s Secret&quot; (2014). He had a retrospective at Dublin&#x27;s Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art in 2005.

In 1975, after a visit to the home of Beverly Pepper in Todi, Italy, O&#x27;Doherty and his wife bought a vacation home in the town, and painted the plastered interior walls in vibrant colors. The house is now open for tours and is known as the Casa Dipinta of Todi.

On 20 May 2008, in recognition of the progress for peace in Ireland, O&#x27;Doherty ceremoniously buried his alter ego at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, and resumed being called by his birth name.

In 2018, at the age of 90, O’Doherty was the subject of three exhibitions celebrating his work in his native Ireland, including the restoration of the room sized “One Here Now” installation he created at the Sirius Arts Centre in Cork in 1995-96.

In &quot;The modern art collection, Trinity College Dublin&quot;, David Scott writes that:

Much influenced by Marcel Duchamp he is an essentially interrogative artist, constantly questioning artistic conventions and the assumptions on which we base our aesthetic judgements.

==Personal life and death==
For more than 30 years, O&#x27;Doherty was married to art historian and former chair of the Art History department at Barnard College, Barbara Novak. He lived and worked in the United States.

O&#x27;Doherty died at his home in New York on 7 November 2022, at the age of 94.

<text>Matthew Turner (died 1788), a Liverpool physician, is considered (for example by Berman, 1990) to be the author or co-author of the 1782 pamphlet, &quot;Answer to Dr. Priestley&#x27;s Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever&quot;, the first published work of avowed atheism in Britain. Turner was also a pioneer in the use of ether for medical purposes, and wrote a pamphlet on the subject. In a footnote, Turner was the man who introduced Josiah Wedgwood to Thomas Bentley in Liverpool, a friendship which led to the formation of the company that produced the famous pottery.

Turner was a friend of Peter Perez Burdett and his scientific knowledge was referred to Joseph Wright of Derby when he constructed his painting of &quot;The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus&quot; in 1771 which is now in Derby Museum and Art Gallery.

<doc id="1291638" wikidata="Q1725167" url="?curid=1291638" title="Lanyon Quoit">
<text>Lanyon Quoit is a dolmen in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, 2 miles southeast of Morvah. It collapsed in a storm in 1815 and was re-erected nine years later, and as a result the dolmen is now very different from its original appearance.

==Location==
Lanyon Quoit is located northwest of Penzance on the road between Madron and Morvah. It stands 50 metres to the east of the road.

700 metres to the west lie the remains of another dolmen known as West Lanyon Quoit.

==Description==
Lanyon Quoit currently has three support stones which stand to a height of 1.5 metres. These bear a capstone which is 5.5 metres long, and which weighs more than 12 tonnes.

In the eighteenth century the quoit had four supporting stones and the structure was tall enough for a person on horseback to ride under. On 19 October 1815, Lanyon Quoit fell down in a storm. Nine years later enough money was raised by local inhabitants to re-erect the structure, under the guidance of Captain Giddy of the Royal Navy. One of the original stones was considered too badly damaged to put back in place, thus there are only three uprights today and the structure does not stand so high as it once did. One of the uprights was turned at right-angles when the quoit was re-erected, but that is the only part of it which had its orientation changed. The cap stone is still aligned much as it was before the monument fell.
The quoit lies at the north end of a long barrow 26 metres long and 12 metres wide. The barrow, which is covered by grass and bracken, is damaged and its outline is difficult to see. At the south end of the barrow are some more large stones that may be the remains of one or more cists.

==Investigations==
In 1769 William Borlase described the megalithic site for the first time in a publication, illustrated with etchings in which the Lanyon Quoit&#x27;s design and floor plan has a different look from today, given changes made following its 1815 collapse. Lanyon Quoit collapsed in a storm in 1815 and was re-erected in 1824.

An etching from 1857 by R. T. Pentreath shows the megaliths in their present arrangement. A similar drawing appears in the 1864 book &quot;A Week at the Land&#x27;s End&quot; by John Thomas Blight.

In 1872 William Copeland Borlase, a descendant of the earlier Borlase, conducted further investigations and excavations were carried out. He reproduced the etchings of his ancestor and found them much more valuable than any other contemporary sketch since the monument had been subjected to such considerable change.

In 1952 the then owner Edward Bolitho from Tregwainton donated the plot of land with the monument to the National Trust.

<doc id="1291639" wikidata="Q4571028" url="?curid=1291639" title="1963 (song)">
<text>&quot;1963&quot; is a track by English rock group New Order. It was originally released as a B-side to &quot;True Faith&quot; in 1987 and appeared on the &quot;Substance&quot; compilation of the same year. It was then released as a single in January 1995, in a radio mix by Arthur Baker.

&quot;1963&quot;&#x27;s B-sides are all remixes of the title track or songs previously released.

==Lyrics==
In &quot;New Order Music 1981–89&quot;, the band&#x27;s lyricist Bernard Sumner writes a tongue-in-cheek account of the song&#x27;s lyrics that relate it to the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Sumner facetiously theorises that Kennedy arranged for Lee Harvey Oswald to shoot his wife so that &quot;J.F. could do one with M. Monroe&quot;. Monroe commits suicide when Oswald hits the wrong target (in reality, Marilyn Monroe died in 1962, over a year before the assassination took place) and Oswald is later shot by his boss (implied to be Jack Ruby), for &quot;doing such a bad job and causing his hit-man business to go bust.&quot;

The producer Stephen Hague has referred to the song as &quot;the only song about domestic violence that you can dance to.&quot;

==Versions==
The original 1987 version ended in a fade-out while repeating the last line of the outro, &quot;I will always feel free&quot;. The &quot;94 album mix&quot;, also included on the international edition of &quot;(The Best of) New Order&quot; as &quot;1963-94&quot;, had all new orchestration and is similar in structure to the original version, except that the outro is removed and replaced with a repeat of the final bridge and chorus, faded out. The 1995 Arthur Baker remix restores the original outro, and, instead of fading out, has a cold ending after four repeats of the last line.

An alternate mix of &quot;1963-94&quot; appeared on the 2005 &quot;Singles&quot; compilation, while the 2016 re-release of &quot;Singles&quot; features the Arthur Baker remix.

==Music video==
The video for the single&#x27;s release, featuring the &quot;95 Arthur Baker Radio remix&quot;, was directed by Gina Birch and produced by Michael H. Shamberg. It depicts British comic actress Jane Horrocks waking up in a box in the countryside and walking to the city. Jane&#x27;s suitcase becomes bigger in each camera take, eventually growing to the size of the box she initially emerged from before she climbs inside.

<doc id="1291648" wikidata="Q62430" url="?curid=1291648" title="Emilie Schindler">
<text>Emilie Schindler (; ; 22 October 1907 – 5 October 2001) was a Sudeten German-born woman who, with her husband Oskar Schindler, helped to save the lives of 1,200 Jews during World War II by employing them in his enamelware and munitions factories, providing them immunity from the Nazis. She was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Israel&#x27;s Yad Vashem in 1994.

== Early life ==
She was born in the village of Maletín in Czechoslovakia, to Sudeten German farmers Josef and Marie Pelzl. She had an older brother, Franz, with whom she was very close.

Schindler&#x27;s early life in Alt Moletein was idyllic, and she was quite fond of nature and animals. She was also interested in the Romani who would camp near the village for a few days at a time; their nomadic lifestyle, their music, and their stories fascinated her.

== Marriage ==
Emilie Pelzl first met Oskar Schindler in 1928, when he came to Alt Moletein to sell electric motors to her father. After dating for six weeks, the couple married on 6 March 1928 in an inn on the outskirts of Svitavy, Schindler&#x27;s hometown.

== World War II ==

In 1938, the unemployed Oskar Schindler joined the Nazi Party and moved to Kraków, leaving his wife in Svitavy. There he gained ownership of an enamelware factory that had lain idle and in bankruptcy for many years and that he renamed &quot;Deutsche Emaillewaren-Fabrik&quot;, where he principally employed Jewish workers because they were the cheapest. However, he soon realized the true brutalities of the Nazis, and the Schindlers started protecting his Jewish laborers. Initially, they saved the workers by bribing the SS guards; later, they listed their employees as essential factory workers, manufacturing munitions for the Reich. When conditions worsened and they started running out of money, she sold her jewels to buy food, clothes, and medicine. She looked after sick workers in a secret sanatorium in the camp in Brněnec, Czech Protectorate, with medical equipment purchased on the black market.

One of the survivors, Maurice Markheim, later recalled:

The Schindlers saved more than 1,200 Jews from extermination camps. In May 1945, when the Soviets moved into Brünnlitz, the Schindlers left the Jews in the factory and went into hiding, in fear of being prosecuted because of Oskar&#x27;s ties with the Nazi party.

== Life after the war ==
The Schindlers fled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, with a dozen of the Schindler Jews. In 1949, they settled there as farmers and were supported financially by a Jewish organization.

In 1957, a bankrupt Oskar Schindler abandoned his wife and returned to Germany, where he died in 1974. Although they never divorced, they also never saw each other again. In 1993, during the production of the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, Emilie Schindler and a number of surviving Schindler Jews visited her husband&#x27;s grave in Jerusalem; she was accompanied by Caroline Goodall, the actress who portrayed her in the film.

After the film&#x27;s release, Emilie&#x27;s close friend and biographer, Erika Rosenberg, quoted Emilie in her book as saying that the filmmakers had paid &quot;not a penny&quot; to Emilie for her contributions to the film. These claims were disputed by Thomas Keneally, author of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;, who claimed he had recently sent Emilie a cheque of his own, and that he had gotten into an argument with Rosenberg over this issue before Emilie angrily told Rosenberg to drop the subject. In his 2001 film &quot;In Praise of Love&quot;, filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard accuses Steven Spielberg of neglecting Emilie while she was supposedly dying, impoverished, in Argentina. In response to Godard, film critic Roger Ebert mused, &quot;Has Godard, having also used her, sent her any money?&quot; and &quot;Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors?&quot;

Schindler lived with her pets for many years in her small house in San Vicente, 40 kilometres south-west of Buenos Aires. She received a small pension from Israel and Germany. Uniformed Argentinian police were posted 24 hours a day to protect her from anti-Semitic extremist groups. She formed friendships with many of the soldiers.

== Death ==
In July 2001, during a visit to Berlin, Schindler told reporters that it was her &quot;greatest and last wish&quot; to spend her final years in Germany, adding that she had become increasingly homesick. She died at the age of 93 from the effects of a stroke in Märkisch-Oderland Hospital, Strausberg, on the night of 5 October 2001, 2½ weeks before her 94th birthday. Her only relative was a niece in Bavaria. She is buried at the cemetery in Waldkraiburg, Germany, about an hour away from Munich. Her tombstone includes the words from the Mishnah, Sanhedrin 4:5, &quot;Wer einen Menschen rettet, rettet die Ganze Welt&quot; (&quot;Whoever saves one life, saves the entire world.&quot;).

== Legacy ==
Schindler was honored by several Jewish organizations for her efforts during World War II. In May 1994, she and her husband received the title Righteous Among the Nations from Yad Vashem, along with Miep Gies, the woman who hid Anne Frank and her family in the Netherlands during the war. In 1995, she was decorated with the Order of May, the highest honor given to foreigners who are not heads of state in Argentina. Her life inspired Erika Rosenberg&#x27;s book &quot;Where Light and Shadow Meet&quot;, first published in Spanish in 1992 and later made available in English and German translations.

She appears in the Thomas Keneally novel &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;.

She is the subject of the opera &quot;Frau Schindler&quot; by composer Thomas Morse, which premiered in 2017 at the Gärtnerplatz Theater in Munich. The following year a new production of the opera, directed by Vladimir Alenikov, was produced at the Stanislavsky Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre for their hundredth anniversary season.

<text>Cazin () is a city located in Una-Sana Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is situated in northwest Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Bosanska Krajina region, near the border with Croatia. As of 2013, it has a population of 66,149 inhabitants. The municipality is often also called Cazinska Krajina. The town of Cazin is located on the main road which connects Bihać and Velika Kladuša.

==History==

Cazin has several historic places, some dating back to the 14th century. The Ostrožac Castle and Radetina Tower are located in Cazin. During the Middle Ages, the city served as the seat of the Roman Catholic bishop of Knin.

The Cazin uprising of 1950, an armed anti-communist rebellion of peasants, occurred in Cazin and neighboring Velika Kladuša and Slunj, which were all part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the time. The peasants revolted against the forced collectivization and collective farms by the Yugoslav government on the farmers of its country.

Following a drought in 1949, the peasants of Yugoslavia were unable to meet unrealistic quotas set by their government and were punished. The revolt that followed the drought resulted in the killings and persecution of those who organized the uprising, but also many innocent civilians. It was the only peasant rebellion in the history of Europe that occurred during the Cold War.

<text>The early modern period is a historical period that is part of, or (depending on the historian) immediately preceded, the modern period, with divisions based primarily on the history of Europe and the broader concept of modernity. There is no exact date that marks the beginning or end of the period and its extent may vary depending on the area of history being studied. In general, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from around the start of the 16th century to the start of the 19th century (about 1500–1800). In a European context, it is defined as the period following the Middle Ages and preceding the advent of modernity; but the dates of these boundaries are far from universally agreed. In the context of global history, the early modern period is often used even in contexts where there is no equivalent &quot;medieval&quot; period.

Various events and historical transitions have been proposed as the start of the early modern period, including the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the start of the Renaissance, the end of the Crusades, the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism and the beginning of the Age of Discovery and with it the onset of the first wave of European colonization. Its end is often marked by the French Revolution, and sometimes also the American Revolution or Napoleon&#x27;s rise to power, with the advent of the second wave modern colonization of New Imperialism.

Historians in recent decades have argued that, from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its spreading globalizing character. New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the period. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of mercantilism as an economic theory. Other notable trends of the period include the development of experimental science, increasingly rapid technological progress, secularized civic politics, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, and the emergence of nation states.

== Definition ==
The early modern period is a subdivision of the most recent of the three major periods of European history: antiquity, the Middle Ages and the modern period. The term &quot;early modern&quot; was first proposed by medieval historian Lynn Thorndike in his 1926 work &quot;A Short History of Civilization&quot; as a broader alternative to the Renaissance. It was first picked up within the field of economic history during the 1940s and 1950s and gradually spread to other historians in the following decades and became widely known among scholars during the 1990s.

== Overview ==

At the onset of the early modern period, trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. Feudalism declined in Europe, and Christendom saw the end of the Crusades and of religious unity in Western Europe under the Roman Catholic Church. The old order was destabilized by the Protestant Reformation, which caused a backlash that expanded the Inquisition and sparked the disastrous European wars of religion, which included the especially bloody Thirty Years&#x27; War and ended with the establishment of the modern international system in the Peace of Westphalia. Along with the European colonization of the Americas, this period also contained the Commercial Revolution and the Golden Age of Piracy. The globalization of the period can be seen in the medieval North Italian city-states and maritime republics, particularly Genoa, Venice, and Milan. Russia reached the Pacific coast in 1647 and consolidated its control over the Russian Far East in the 19th century. The Great Divergence took place as Western Europe greatly surpassed China in technology and per capita wealth.

As the Age of Revolution dawned, beginning with revolts in America and France, political changes were then pushed forward in other countries partly as a result of upheavals of the Napoleonic Wars and their impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing armies. The early period ended in a time of political and economic change, as a result of mechanization in society, the American Revolution, and the first French Revolution; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the of the Congress of Vienna and the peace established by the Second Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars.

In the Americas, pre-Columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the Aztec Empire, the Inca civilization, the Maya civilization and its cities, and the Muisca. The European colonization of the Americas began during the early modern period, as did the establishment of European trading hubs in Asia and Africa, which contributed to the spread of Christianity around the world. The rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe, in particular the Columbian Exchange that linked the Old World and the New World, greatly altered the human environment. Notably, the Atlantic slave trade and colonization of Native Americans began during this period. The Ottoman Empire conquered Southeastern Europe, and parts of West Asia and North Africa.

In the Islamic world, after the fall of the Timurid Renaissance, powers such as the Ottoman, Suri, Safavid, and Mughal empires grew in strength (three of which are known as gunpowder empires for the military technology that enabled them). Particularly in the Indian subcontinent, Mughal architecture, culture, and art reached their zenith, while the empire itself is believed to have had the world&#x27;s largest economy, bigger than the entirety of Western Europe and worth 25% of global GDP. By the mid-18th century, India was a major proto-industrializing region.

Various Chinese dynasties controlled the East Asian sphere. In Japan, the Edo period from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. In Korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the Joseon dynasty to the enthronement of King Gojong. By the 16th century, Asian economies under the Ming dynasty and Mughal Bengal were stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the Nanban trade after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the Azuchi–Momoyama period.

Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia, the Toungoo Empire along with Ayutthaya experienced a golden age and ruled a large extent of Mainland Southeast Asia, with the Nguyen and Trinh lords de facto ruling the south and north of present-day Vietnam respectively, whereas the Mataram Sultanate was the dominant power in Maritime Southeast Asia. The early modern period experienced an influx of European traders and missionaries into the region.

== Asia and Africa ==
=== East Asia ===
In early modern times, the major nations of East Asia attempted to pursue a course of isolationism from the outside world but this policy was not always enforced uniformly or successfully. However, by the end of the early modern period, China, Korea and Japan were mostly closed and uninterested in Europeans, even while trading relationships grew in port cities such as Guangzhou and Dejima.

==== Chinese dynasties ====
Around the beginning of the ethnically Han Ming dynasty (1368–1644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China&#x27;s scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them. Many scholars have speculated about the reason behind China&#x27;s lag in advancement. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China&#x27;s urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe&#x27;s and China&#x27;s inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China&#x27;s Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists to break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei. Despite inventing gunpowder in the 9th century, it was in Europe that the classic handheld firearms, matchlocks, were invented, with evidence of use around the 1480s. China was using the matchlocks by 1540, after the Portuguese brought their matchlocks to Japan in the early 1500s. China during the Ming dynasty established a bureau to maintain its calendar. The bureau was necessary because the calendars were linked to celestial phenomena and that needs regular maintenance because twelve lunar months have 344 or 355 days, so occasional leap months have to be added in order to maintain 365 days per year.

In the early Ming dynasty, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. In the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China&#x27;s global trade, its economy ran on paper money. However, in the 14th century, China&#x27;s paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed. The silver imports helped fill the void left by the broken paper money system, which helps explain why the value of silver in China was twice as high as the value of silver in Spain during the end of the 16th century.

China under the later Ming dynasty became isolated, prohibiting the construction of ocean going sea vessels. Despite isolationist policies the Ming economy still suffered from an inflation due to an overabundance of Spanish New World silver entering its economy through new European colonies such as Macau. Ming China was further strained by victorious but costly wars to protect Korea from Japanese invasion. The European trade depression of the 1620s also hurt the Chinese economy, which sunk to the point where all of China&#x27;s trading partners cut ties with them: Philip IV restricted shipments of exports from Acapulco, the Japanese cut off all trade with Macau, and the Dutch severed connections between Goa and Macau.

The damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient Little Ice Age, natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people&#x27;s livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as Li Zicheng, to challenge Ming authority.

The Ming dynasty fell around 1644 to the ethnically Manchu Qing dynasty, which would be the last dynasty of China. The Qing ruled from 1644 to 1912, with a brief, abortive restoration in 1917. During its reign, the Qing dynasty adopted many of the outward features of Chinese culture in establishing its rule, but did not necessarily &quot;assimilate&quot;, instead adopting a more universalist style of governance. The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens. When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng&#x27;s peasant rebels in 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper. Schoppa, the editor of &quot;The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History&quot; argues, &quot;A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical &#x27;reality&#x27;. It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&quot;

==== Japanese shogunates ====
The Sengoku period that began around 1467 and lasted around a century consisted of several continually &quot;warring states&quot;.

Following contact with the Portuguese on Tanegashima Isle in 1543, the Japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the arquebus, European-style cuirasses, European ships), religion (Christianity), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a Western vocabulary) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced tempura and valuable refined sugar.

Central government was largely reestablished by Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Azuchi–Momoyama period. Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install Ashikaga Yoshiaki as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the Ashikaga shogunate, and it lasts until the coming to power of Tokugawa Ieyasu after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Tokugawa received the title of &quot;shōgun&quot; in 1603, establishing the Tokugawa shogunate.

The Edo period from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a feudalist regime of Japan established by Tokugawa Ieyasu and ruled by the &quot;shōguns&quot; of the Tokugawa clan. The period gets its name from the capital city, Edo, now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from Edo Castle from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the Meiji Restoration in the late Edo period (often called the Late Tokugawa shogunate).

Society in the Japanese &quot;Tokugawa period&quot; (Edo society), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The &quot;daimyōs&quot; (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of samurai, with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the &quot;Sakoku&quot; policy. Literacy among the Japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.

In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, &quot;daimyōs&quot; and samurai were more or less identical, since &quot;daimyōs&quot; might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.

==== Korean dynasty ====
In 1392, General Yi Seong-gye established the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. Yi Seong-gye moved the capital of Korea to the location of modern-day Seoul. The dynasty was heavily influenced by Confucianism, which also played a large role to shaping Korea&#x27;s strong cultural identity. King Sejong the Great (1418–1450), one of the only two kings in Korea&#x27;s history to earn the title of great in their posthumous titles, reclaimed Korean territory to the north and created the Korean alphabet.

During the end of the 16th century, Korea was invaded twice by Japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. Japan failed both times due to Admiral Yi Sun-sin, Korea&#x27;s revered naval genius, who led the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called turtle ships. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi&#x27;s navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan&#x27;s second invasion. During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by Manchurians, who would later take over China as the Qing dynasty. In 1637, King Injo was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubines to the Qing Prince Dorgon.

=== South Asia ===

====Indian empires====


The rise of the Mughal Empire is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the Middle Ages. It was an Islamic Persianate imperial power that ruled most of the area as Hindustan by the late 17th and the early 18th centuries. The empire dominated South Asia,
becoming the largest global economy and manufacturing power, with a nominal GDP valued at a quarter of the global economy, superior than the combined GDP of Europe. The empire, prior to the death of the last prominent emperor Aurangzeb, was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting its different provinces. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterized by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Confederacy, founded in the southwest of present-day India, surpassed the Mughals as the dominant power in India from 1740 and rapidly expanded until the Third Battle of Panipat halted their expansion in 1761.

==== British and Dutch colonization ====
The development of New Imperialism saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers. The commercial colonization of India commenced in 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, when the Nawab of Bengal surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company, in 1765, when the company was granted the &quot;diwani&quot;, or the right to collect revenue, in Bengal and Bihar, or in 1772, when the company established a capital in Calcutta, appointed its first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and became directly involved in governance.

The Maratha Confederacy, following the Anglo-Maratha wars, eventually lost to the British East India Company in 1818 with the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Rule by the Company lasted until 1858, when, after the Indian rebellion of 1857 and following the Government of India Act 1858, the British government assumed the task of directly administering India in the new British Raj. In 1819, Stamford Raffles established Singapore as a key trading post for Britain in its rivalry with the Dutch. However, the rivalry cooled in 1824 when an Anglo-Dutch treaty demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.

=== Southeast Asia ===
At the start of the modern era, the Spice Route between India and China crossed Majapahit, an archipelagic empire based on the island of Java. It was the last of the major Hindu empires of Maritime Southeast Asia and is considered one of the greatest states in Indonesian history. Its influence extended to Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and eastern Indonesia, though the effectiveness of this influence remains debated. Majapahit struggled to control the rising Sultanate of Malacca, which dominated Muslim Malay settlements in Phuket, Satun, Pattani, and Sumatra. The Portuguese invaded Malacca&#x27;s capital in 1511, and by 1528, the Sultanate of Johor was established by a Malaccan prince to succeed Malacca.

=== West Asia and North Africa ===
==== Ottoman Empire ====

During the early modern era, the Ottoman Empire enjoyed an expansion and consolidation of power, leading to a &quot;Pax Ottomana&quot;. This was perhaps the golden age of the empire. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent Persian Shi&#x27;a Safavid Empire to the east.

==== North Africa ====
In the Ottoman sphere, the Turks seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of Algeria, Tunisia, and Tripolitania (between 1519 and 1551), Morocco remaining an independent Arabized Berber state under the Sharifan dynasty.

==== Safavid Iran ====

The Safavid Empire was a great Shia Persianate empire after the Islamic conquest of Persia and the establishment of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sassanids to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.

What fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi&#x27;a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.

==== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ====

In the 16th to early 18th centuries, Central Asia was under the rule of Uzbeks, and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local Pashtuns. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the Kipchaks, Naimans, Kangly, Khongirad, and Manghuds. These groups were led by Muhammad Shaybani, who was the Khan of the Uzbeks.

The lineage of the Afghan Pashtuns stretches back to the Hotaki dynasty. Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun &quot;ghazis&quot; (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the Lodhi dynasty and Suri dynasty. Pashtun forces also invaded Persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in the Battle of Gulnabad. The Pashtuns later formed the Durrani Empire.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===

The Songhai Empire took control of the trans-Saharan trade at the beginning of the modern era. It seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to Gao.

== Europe ==
Many major events caused Europe to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the fall of Muslim Spain and the discovery of the Americas in 1492, and Martin Luther&#x27;s Protestant Reformation in 1517. In England the modern period is often dated to the start of the Tudor period with the victory of Henry VII over Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Early modern European history is usually seen to span from the start of the 15th century, through the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century.

The early modern period is taken to end with the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire at the Congress of Vienna. At the end of the early modern period, the British and Russian empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of colonial empires, while the three great Asian empires of the early modern period, Ottoman Turkey, Mughal India and Qing China, all entered a period of stagnation or decline.

=== Gunpowder and firearms ===

When gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use; European countries took advantage of this and were the first to create the classic firearms. The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets. The musket was able to penetrate all forms of armor available at the time, making armor obsolete, and as a consequence the heavy musket as well. Although there is relatively little to no difference in design between arquebus and musket except in size and strength, it was the term &quot;musket&quot; which remained in use up into the 1800s.

=== European kingdoms and movements ===
In the early modern period, the Holy Roman Empire was a union of territories in Central Europe under a Holy Roman Emperor the first of which was Otto I. The last was Francis II, who abdicated and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.

The Renaissance was a cultural movement that began in the 14th century, beginning in Italy in the Late Middle Ages and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic era, but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on classical sources, the development of linear perspective in painting, and gradual but widespread educational reform.

==== Notable individuals ====
Johannes Gutenberg is credited as the first European to use movable type printing, around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical printing press. Nicolaus Copernicus formulated a comprehensive heliocentric cosmology (1543), which displaced the Earth from the center of the universe. His book, &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres&quot;) began modern astronomy and sparked the Scientific Revolution. Another notable individual was Machiavelli, an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern political science. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, The Prince, a work of realist political theory. The Swiss Paracelsus (1493–1541) is associated with a medical revolution while the Anglo-Irish Robert Boyle was one of the founders of modern chemistry. In visual arts, notable representatives included the &quot;three giants of the High Renaissance&quot;, namely Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, Albrecht Dürer (often considered the greatest artist of Northern Renaissance), Titian from the Venetian school, Peter Paul Rubens of the Flemish Baroque traditions. Famous composers included Guillaume Du Fay, Heinrich Isaac, Josquin des Prez, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Claudio Monteverdi, Jean-Baptiste Lully.

Among the notable royalty of the time was Charles the Bold (1433–1477), the last Valois Duke of Burgundy, known as &quot;Charles the Bold (or Rash)&quot; to his enemies, His early death was a pivotal moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit, although in administrative affairs, he introduced remarkable modernizing innovations. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, Mary of Burgundy, as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor secured the match for his son, the future Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, with the aid of Mary&#x27;s stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, Archduke of Austria. A conflict between the Burgundian side (Maximilian brought with himself almost no resources from the Empire) and France ensued, culminating in the Treaty of Senlis (1493) which gave the majority of Burgundian inheritance to the Habsburg (Mary already died in 1482). The rise of the Habsburg dynasty was a prime factor in the spreading of the Renaissance.

In Central Europe, King Matthias Corvinus (1443–1490), a notable nation builder, conqueror (Hungary in his time was the most powerful in Central Europe) and patron, was the first who introduced the Renaissance outside of Italy. In military area, he introduced the Black Army, one of the first standing armies in Europe and a remarkably modern force.

Some noblemen from the generation that lived during this period have been attributed the moniker &quot;the last knight&quot;, with the most notable being the above-mentioned Maximilian I (1459–1519), Chevalier de Bayard (1476–1524), Franz von Sickingen (1481–1523) and Götz von Berlichingen (1480–1562). Maximilian (although Claude Michaud opines that he could claim &quot;last knight&quot; status by virtue of being the last medieval epic poet) was actually a chief modernizing force of the time (whose reform initiatives led to Europe-wide revolutions in the areas of warfare and communications, among others), who broke the back of the knight class (causing many to become robber barons) and had personal conflicts with the three other men on the matter of the knight&#x27;s status.

=== Christians and Christendom ===

Christianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the Counter Reformation.

==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====
The Hussite Crusades (1419–1434) involved military actions against the followers of Jan Hus in Bohemia, concluding with the Battle of Grotniki. These wars were notable for being among the first European conflicts where hand-held gunpowder weapons, like muskets, played a decisive role. The Taborite faction of Hussite warriors, primarily infantry, decisively defeated larger armies with heavily armored knights, contributing to the infantry revolution. However, the Hussite Crusades were ultimately inconclusive.

The final crusade, the Crusade of 1456, was organized to counter the advancing Ottoman Empire and lift the Siege of Belgrade (1456), led by John Hunyadi and Giovanni da Capistrano. The siege culminated in a counterattack that forced Sultan Mehmet II to retreat, with the victory being credited with deciding the fate of Christendom. The noon bell, ordered by Pope Callixtus III, commemorates this victory across the Christian world to this day.

Nearly a century later, the Peace of Augsburg (1555) ended the concept of a united Christian church. The principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; allowed rulers to determine their state&#x27;s religion. This framework was solidified by the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which ended the European Wars of Religion and the notion of a singular Christian hegemony. The treaty also marked the birth of the modern concept of national sovereignty.

==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====
The Inquisition in the modern era refers to several institutions within the Catholic Church tasked with prosecuting heretics and others who violated canon law. The first significant manifestation was the Spanish Inquisition (1478–1834). The Inquisition prosecuted crimes such as sorcery, blasphemy, Judaizing, witchcraft, and censorship of printed literature. Its jurisdiction was limited to baptized Catholics, while non-Christians were typically tried by secular courts.

The Reformation and rise of modernity in the early 16th century brought changes to Christendom. The Augustinian friar Martin Luther in Germany challenged the Church with his Ninety-five Theses, marking the start of the Reformation. Luther&#x27;s movement, supported by the Electorate of Saxony, developed at the University of Wittenberg, where he became a professor.

Luther&#x27;s 95 Theses criticized practices like the sale of indulgences and sparked debates, leading to the rise of rival Protestant denominations, such as Lutheranism and the Reformed tradition. In England, the movement became known as the English Reformation, resulting in the formation of Anglicanism.

The Diet of Worms (1521) declared Luther a heretic, but Emperor Charles V was preoccupied with external threats and allowed German princes to decide whether to enforce the Edict of Worms. The religious conflict escalated, leading to the formation of the Schmalkaldic League to defend Protestant interests. This culminated in the Peace of Augsburg (1555), which established the principle of cuius regio, eius religio—allowing rulers to determine the religion of their territories.

Two main Inquisitions remained active in the modern era:

*The Portuguese Inquisition (1536–1821), similar to the Spanish Inquisition.
*The Roman Inquisition (1542–circa 1860), covering most of the Italian peninsula and certain other areas.
The Counter-Reformation began in 1545 with the Council of Trent in response to the Protestant Reformation. Its goal was to reform internal Church practices while reaffirming the Church&#x27;s authority as the true Church of Christ.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
In development of the Third Rome ideas, the Grand Duke Ivan IV (the &quot;Awesome&quot; or &quot;the Terrible&quot;) was officially crowned the first Tsar (&quot;Caesar&quot;) of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws (Sudebnik of 1550), established the first Russian feudal representative body (Zemsky Sobor) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions. During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated Golden Horde): Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga River, and Sibirean Khanate in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a multiethnic, multiconfessional and transcontinental state.

Russia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of Cossacks. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World. The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian/Ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the steppe and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.

==== Mercantile capitalism ====
===== Trade and the new economy =====
In the Old World, the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and spices. Western Europeans used the compass, new sailing ship technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable trade route to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.
===== Piracy&#x27;s Golden Age =====
The Golden Age of Piracy is a designation given to one or more outbursts of piracy in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The buccaneering period covers approximately the late 17th century. This period was characterized by Anglo-French seamen based in Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The Pirate Round was a route followed by certain Anglo-American pirates in the early 18th century, involving voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to attack Muslim and East India Company ships in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-War of the Spanish Succession period saw many unemployed sailors and privateers turning to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, West Africa, and the Indian Ocean.

==== European states and politics ====
The 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today&#x27;s states. Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term &quot;Renaissance man&quot;.

The Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern diplomatic congress. Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire. The Treaty of the Pyrenees, signed in 1659, ended the war between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.

===== French power =====
Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include Mazarin, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Turenne, Vauban. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including Molière, Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, Lully, Le Brun, Rigaud, Louis Le Vau, Jules Hardouin Mansart, Claude Perrault and Le Nôtre.

===== Early English revolutions =====
Before the Age of Revolution, the English Civil War was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament&#x27;s consent. The English Restoration, or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 establishes modern parliamentary democracy in England.

===== International balance of power =====
The Peace of Utrecht established after a series of individual peace treaties signed in the Dutch city of Utrecht concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and Philip V of Spain on the one hand, and representatives of Queen Anne of Great Britain, the Duke of Savoy, and the United Provinces on the other. The treaty enregistered the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of Louis XIV and preserved the European system based on the balance of power. The Treaty of Utrecht marked the change from Dutch to British naval supremacy.

== Americas ==

The term &quot;colonialism&quot; is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to Sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Australia and the Philippines.

=== Exploration and conquest of the Americas ===
=== Colonial Latin America ===
Initially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in sugarcane. Black African slave labour from Portugal&#x27;s West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized some Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.

=== Colonial North America ===

North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia, but nowhere near the size of those in New Spain or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called New Netherland (now New York State.). France colonized what is now Eastern Canada, founding Quebec City in 1608. France&#x27;s loss in the Seven Years&#x27; War resulted in the transfer of New France to Great Britain.

The Thirteen Colonies, in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule through 1765–1783, due to various factors such as belief in natural rights, the enforcement of new taxes levied by a Parliament which they could not vote for representatives in, and opposition to monarchy. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on 4 July 1776, and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War, Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies&#x27; independence.

==Atlantic World==
A key development in early modern history is the creation of the Atlantic World as a category. The term generally encompasses Western Europe, West Africa, and the Americas. It seeks to illustrate both local and regional developments, as well as the connections between these geographical regions through trade, migration, and cultural exchange.

== Religion, science, philosophy, and education ==
=== Protestant Reformation ===
The early modern period was initiated by the Reformation and the collapse of the unity of the medieval Western Church. The theology of Calvinism in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of capitalism. Max Weber has written a highly influential book on this called &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.&quot;

=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===
The Counter-Reformation was a period of Catholic revival in response to the Reformation during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical reforms as well as political and spiritual movements.

Such reforms included the foundation of seminaries for the proper training of priests, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations, and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with Christ, including the Spanish mystics and the French school of spirituality. It also involved political activities that included the Roman Inquisition.

New religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the Capuchins, Ursulines, Theatines, Discalced Carmelites, the Barnabites, and especially the Jesuits strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church, and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.

=== Scientific Revolution ===

The Great Divergence in scientific discovery, technological innovation, and economic development began in the early modern period as the pace of change in Western countries increased significantly compared to the rest of the world.

During the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, empiricism and modern science replaced older methods of studying nature, which had relied on ancient texts by writers like Aristotle. By the time of the Revolution, these methods resulted in an accumulation of knowledge that overturned ideas inherited from ancient Greece and Islamic scholars. Major changes during the Scientific Revolution and the 18th century included:
*The ancient geocentric model of the solar system (the other planets circle the Earth) was replaced by the heliocentrism (the planets circle the Sun). This shift, known as the Copernican Revolution, is marked by the 1543 publication of Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;. Copernicus&#x27; work, influenced by earlier scholars such as Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Din al-Urdi, sparked a significant paradigm shift. The Catholic Church resisted this theory, and the Inquisition famously imprisoned Galileo Galilei for promoting it.
*Using precise astronomical observations by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler developed Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, demonstrating that planets move in ellipses rather than perfect circles. The idea that the stars were fixed on celestial spheres was replaced by the idea that stars are distant suns. Astrology and astronomy began to separate into different disciplines, with only astronomy using scientific methods. Telescope technology improved tremendously as did the study of optics.
*Aristotle&#x27;s laws of motion were replaced by Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. The 1687 publication of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; is often used to mark the end of the Scientific Revolution, as it established the fundamental laws of physics that would dominate scientific thinking for centuries.
*Advances in anatomy were marked by the publication of &quot;De Humani Corporis Fabrica Libri Septem&quot; (1543) by Andreas Vesalius, which revolutionized the understanding of human anatomy and corrected errors in the works of Galen. In 1628, William Harvey&#x27;s &quot;De Motu Cordis&quot; advanced knowledge of the circulatory system.
*Both the 8th century Islamic experimenter Jabir ibn Hayyan and the 17th century scientist Robert Boyle have been described as founders of modern chemistry. Both worked as alchemists before the fields were clearly separated. Boyle argued for corpuscularianism in the 1661 book &quot;The Sceptical Chymist&quot; and discovered Boyle&#x27;s law of gases. The chemical revolution followed with the discovery of the conservation of mass, which led to the rejection of phlogiston theory and the identification of chemical elements.
*Modern scientific dentistry was founded by Pierre Fauchard, who is credited with pioneering dental techniques in his 1728 work &quot;Le Chirurgien Dentiste&quot;.
*The smallpox vaccine was invented in the 1770s and popularized by Edward Jenner in the 1790s, though it was unclear at the time how it worked.
*The ancient theory of spontaneous generation remained dominant throughout the early modern period, but the history of evolutionary thought includes some who questioned the strictest form of this dogma. The idea of partial common descent was famously promoted by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. Evolution was not fully articulated and accepted until the 19th century.
*The invention of the microscope led to the development of microbiology, with early observations of microorganisms by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s.
*Carl Linnaeus published the first modern taxonomy in &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (1735), introducing the classification of organisms into hierarchical categories and replacing Aristotle&#x27;s ideas.
*Early modern geology was established with the work of Nicolas Steno, who proposed the law of superposition in 1669, and the systematic study of fossils and rock types began to question the biblical age of the Earth.
*Early developments in the history of electromagnetism included research into the relationship between electricity and magnetism, the development of the electrostatic generator, and the discovery of Coulomb&#x27;s law in 1784, which described the force between electric charges.

In the social sciences:
*Historical linguistics began in the late 18th century, with William Jones identifying the common origin of what are now called Indo-European languages.
* The fields of anthropology and paleoanthropology emerged in the 18th century, but much of early modern anthropology is now considered scientific racism.
*Adam Smith&#x27;s work, such as his seminal book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, has been interpreted as the foundation of classical economics.

===Technology===

Inventions of the early modern period included the floating dock, lifting tower, newspaper, grenade musket, lightning rod, bifocals, and Franklin stove. Early attempts at building a practical electrical telegraph were hindered because static electricity was the only source available.

=== Enlightenment and reason ===


The Age of Enlightenment is also called the Age of Reason because it marked a departure from the medieval tradition of scholasticism, which was rooted in Christian dogma, and from Renaissance philosophy&#x27;s occultist approaches. Instead, reason became the central source of knowledge, initiating the era of modern philosophy, especially in Western philosophy. This period in Europe was characterized by system-builders—philosophers who established unified theories of epistemology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, and sometimes even politics and the physical sciences.

Early 17th-century philosophy is often referred to as the Age of Rationalism, succeeding Renaissance philosophy and preceding the Enlightenment. Some consider it the earliest part of the Enlightenment, stretching over two centuries. This era includes the works of Isaac Newton (1643–1727), such as Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), and the development of Descartes&#x27; famous proposition Cogito, ergo sum (1637). The first major advancements in modern science included Newton&#x27;s theory of gravity, which, along with the contributions of John Locke, Pierre Bayle, Baruch Spinoza, and others, fueled the Enlightenment.

The 18th century saw the rise of secularization in Europe, notably following the French Revolution. Immanuel Kant classified his predecessors into two philosophical schools: Rationalism and Empiricism. The former was represented by figures such as René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz. Roger Williams established the colony of Providence Plantations in New England on the principle of separation of church and state after being exiled by the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

French salon culture played a key role in spreading Enlightenment ideas, culminating in the influential Encyclopédie (1751–72), edited by Denis Diderot with contributions from thinkers such as Voltaire and Montesquieu. The Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns stirred debate within the French Academy, elevating contemporary knowledge over classical Greek and Roman wisdom. Enlightenment thought also significantly influenced German philosophy, fostered by Frederick the Great, with Immanuel Kant emerging as a leading figure. These developments also had profound impacts on the Scottish Enlightenment, Russian Enlightenment, Enlightenment in Spain, and Enlightenment in Poland. The Enlightenment flourished until around 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to Romanticism and the growing influence of Counter-Enlightenment movements.

=== Humanism ===
With the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian Renaissance Humanism spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the Reformation.

Developing during the Enlightenment era, Renaissance humanism as an intellectual movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). The term &quot;umanista&quot; comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the &quot;studia humanitatis&quot;, a novel curriculum that was competing with the &quot;quadrivium&quot; and scholastic logic.

In France, pre-eminent Humanist Guillaume Budé (1467–1540) applied the philological methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on Justinian&#x27;s Code. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian &quot;umanisti&quot;), Budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for Francis I and helping to found the Collège des Lecteurs Royaux (later the ). Meanwhile, Marguerite de Navarre, the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic, gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including Clément Marot, Pierre de Ronsard and François Rabelais.

== Death in the early modern period ==
=== Mortality rates ===
During the early modern period, thorough and accurate global data on mortality rates is limited for a number of reasons including disparities in medical practices and views on the dead. However, there still remains data from European countries that still holds valuable information on the mortality rates of infants during this era. In his book &quot;Life Under Pressure: Mortality and Living Standards in Europe and Asia, 1700–1900&quot;, Tommy Bengtsson provides adequate information pertaining to the data of infant mortality rates in European countries as well as provide necessary contextual influences on these mortality rates.

==== European infant mortality rates ====
Infant mortality was a global concern during the early modern period as many newborns would not survive into childhood. Bengsston provides comparative data on infant mortality averages in a variety of European towns, cities, regions and countries starting from the mid-1600s to the 1800s. These statistics are measured for infant deaths within the first month of every 1,000 births in a given area.

For instance, the average infant mortality rate in what is now Germany was 108 infant deaths for every 1,000 births; in Bavaria, there were 140–190 infant deaths reported for every 1,000 births. In France, Beauvaisis reported 140–160 infants dying per every 1,000 babies born. In what is now Italy, Venice averaged 134 infant deaths per 1,000 births. In Geneva, 80–110 infants died per every 1,000 babies born. In Sweden, 70–95 infants died per 1,000 births in Linköping, 48 infants died per 1,000 births in Sundsvall, and 41 infants died per 1,000 births in Vastanfors.

==== Causes of infant mortality ====
Bengsston writes that climate conditions were the most important factor in determining infant mortality rates: &quot;For the period from birth to the fifth birthday, [climate] is clearly the most important determinant of death&quot;. Winters proved to be harsh on families and their newborns, especially if the other seasons of the year were warmer. This seasonal drop in temperature was a lot for an infant&#x27;s body to adapt to.

For instance, Italy is home to a very warm climate in the summer, and the temperature drops immensely in the winter. This lends context to Bengsston writing that &quot;the [Italian] winter peak was the cruelest: during the first 10 days of life, a newborn was four times more likely to die than in the summer&quot;. According to Bengsston, this trend existed amongst cities in different parts of Italy and in various parts of Europe even though cities operated under different economic and agricultural conditions. This leads Bengsston to his conclusion on what may have caused mortality rates in infants to spike during winter: &quot;The strong protective effect of summer for neonatal deaths leads us to suppose that in many cases, these might be due to the insufficient heating systems of the houses or to the exposure of the newborn to cold during the baptism ceremony. This last hypothesis could explain why the effect was so strong in Italy&quot;.

=== Capital punishment ===

During the early modern period, many societies&#x27; views on death changed greatly. With the implementation of new torture techniques, and increased public executions, people began to give more value to their life, and their body after death. Along with the views on death, methods of execution also changed. New devices to torture and execute criminals were invented. The number of criminals executed by gibbeting increased, as did the total rate of executions during the early modern period.

<text>Albert Neilson Hornby, nicknamed Monkey Hornby (10 February 1847 – 17 December 1925) was one of the best-known sportsmen in England during the nineteenth century excelling in both rugby and cricket. He was the first of only two men to captain the country at both rugby and cricket but is also remembered as the England cricket captain whose side lost the Test match which gave rise to the Ashes, at home against the Australians in 1882. Additionally, he played football for Blackburn Rovers.

==Early life==
He was the sixth son of William Henry Hornby, a cotton mill proprietor and director of the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway who was Member of Parliament (MP) for Blackburn from 1857 to 1865. His brothers, Edward and Harry, were also MPs for Blackburn from 1869 to 1874, and from 1886 to 1910 respectively. Edward and another brother Cecil also played first-class cricket. Albert attended Harrow School, for whom he played against Eton College at Lord&#x27;s, and from there returned to Lancashire to join the family business.

==Cricket career==
Whilst at Harrow, his family had moved to Shrewbridge Hall, Nantwich, Cheshire, and he first played cricket for that county in 1862 and played in 20 matches between then and 1876. His club cricket was for the East Lancashire Club, Blackburn and he was first tried for Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1867. It was with his county that he was to play his finest cricket. From 1869 to 1899 he played 683 innings in first-class cricket with an average of over 24 runs. He played for Lancashire for 33 years, 17 as captain (in 1879–1893 and 1897–1898). For many years he provided an ideal attacking foil to the careful defence of his opening partner, Dick Barlow, with whom he was immortalised in one of the best known of all cricket poems, &quot;At Lord&#x27;s&quot; by Francis Thompson which contains the following lines:

&lt;poem&gt;
 It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,
 Though my own red roses there may blow;
 It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,
 Though the red roses crest the caps, I know.
 For the field is full of shades as I near a shadowy coast,
 And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,
 And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host
 As the run stealers flicker to and fro,
 To and fro:
 O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!
&lt;/poem&gt;

His lack of stature and excess of energy earned him the nickname &quot;Monkey&quot; whilst at school and this stuck, while his players called him &quot;The Boss&quot;, for his martinet approach to captaincy. His prowess as a forceful front-foot player, was matched by his fielding abilities. Between 1870 and 1881 he was the only player for Lancashire to reach a century for the club, which he did on seven occasions and in 1881 he topped the national averages, with his 1531 runs including three centuries.

Hornby was unable to carry his county form with the bat into the Test arena, his 3.50 average being a testament to this fact. In his debut Test on the 1878–79 Australian tour (during this tour, Hornby was caught up in the Sydney Riot of 1879) he lost his wicket in both innings to Spofforth; this was to be repeated in his next Test in 1882. The Test match in 1882 was a one-off game played at The Oval in London, England, and the English cricket team lost it to Australia by seven runs. In response, the Sporting Times printed the following &quot;obituary&quot; to English cricket:
&quot;In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. N.B. – The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.&quot;
Thus was born the greatest rivalry in cricket which to this day is known as The Ashes. AN Hornby captained England in only one more Test (his last), standing in for Lord Harris (who had stood out in protest) in the first Test of 1884. The match was played at Old Trafford on 10, 11 and 12 July 1884 and was drawn. Hornby avoided Spofforth but his 0 and 4 in the two innings remained undistinguished and in the same test match he also became the first player to be stumped in both innings of a single test match.

In addition to his county and country, he also played first-class cricket for Marylebone Cricket Club between 1873 and 1898. Aside from his playing for Lancashire, Hornby also held the posts of Lancashire chairman from 1878 to 1898, and Lancashire president from 1894 to 1916. He denounced the formation of cricket leagues as being against the best interests of the game.

==Rugby career==
Hornby first played for the Preston Grasshoppers and thence on to Manchester Football Club. His first game for England was on 5 February 1877 under the captaincy of Edward Kewley, a fellow Lancastrian. This match was the first 15-a-side international and was between England and Ireland at the Oval. He played as a three-quarter and despite being 30 years old, kept his place. He was present in the team in 1878 but due to his overseas international cricketing commitments in 1879 was unable to play rugby for his country that year. He was recalled to the side in 1880 as a full back and it was in this position that he was called upon to captain his country in 1882. The game was played in Manchester on 4 March 1882 against Scotland who won by 2 tries to nil. When, later that year, Hornby led the England cricket team out at the Oval to play the Australians he became the first man to captain his country in both sports and this in his 36th year. He is one of only two men to have captained England at both these sports, the other being Andrew Stoddart.

==Association football==
As well as becoming captain of the national side for both cricket and rugby, Hornby was also selected to play for Blackburn Rovers in their inaugural game at Alexandra Meadows, against Partick Thistle on 2 January 1878. He played for them in a few subsequent matches. He later appeared for Nantwich where he also served as Club President.

Newspaper correspondence in the 1950s suggests the 1877 formation of Crewe Alexandra Football Club as an offshoot of Crewe Alexandra Cricket Club was proposed by Hornby, who elicited the support of &#x27;Thomas Abrams&#x27; (presumably Thomas Abraham) and other founders.

==Personal life==
 In 1876 he married Ada Sarah Ingram, the daughter of Herbert Ingram MP, the founder and proprietor of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;. With Ada he lived in Church Minshull, Nantwich and they had four sons all of whom went to Harrow. George Vernon (1879–1905) died in South Africa, having served in the Boer War whilst Walter Ingram (1878–1918) died of wounds received in France. The youngest, John, (1880–1927) was also wounded during the First World War, was awarded the Military Cross, and later died when exploring in the north of Canada. The eldest son, Albert Henry (1877–1952) went on to Trinity College, Cambridge and like his father played and captained Lancashire. Between 1899 and 1914 he played 283 matches – only nine matches fewer than his father.

Hornby was also a Captain of 1st Royal Cheshire Militia. He died at Parkfield, Nantwich, Cheshire on 17 December 1925, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church in nearby Acton.

==Portrayals==
Hornby is one of the main characters in the Netflix mini-series &quot;The English Game&quot; (2020), played by Harry Michell.

<text>The order Polypodiales encompasses the major lineages of polypod ferns, which comprise more than 80% of today&#x27;s fern species. They are found in many parts of the world including tropical, semitropical and temperate areas.

==Description==
Polypodiales are unique in bearing sporangia with a vertical annulus interrupted by the stalk and stomium. These sporangial characters were used by Johann Jakob Bernhardi to define a group of ferns he called the &quot;Cathetogyratae&quot;; the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group has suggested reviving this name as the informal term cathetogyrates, to replace the ambiguously circumscribed term &quot;polypods&quot; when referring to the Polypodiales. The sporangia are born on stalks 1–3 cells thick and are often long-stalked. (In contrast, the Hymenophyllales have a stalk composed of four rows of cells.) The sporangia do not reach maturity simultaneously. Many groups in the order lack indusia, but when present, they are attached either along the edge of the indusium or in its center.

Both Polypodiales and Cyatheales differ from other ferns in having a photoreceptor called a neochrome, which allows them to perform photosynthesis better in low-light conditions, such as in the shadows on the forest floor. The common ancestor of the two groups appears to have derived the neochrome via horizontal gene transfer from a hornwort.

Their gametophytes are green, usually heart-shaped, and grow at the surface (rather than underground, as in Ophioglossales).

==Taxonomy==
The order Polypodiales was first described by Link in 1833. The circumscription of the order has changed over time as ferns have been classified in many different ways (see the review by Christenhusz and Chase, 2014). Smith et al. (2006) carried out the first higher-level pteridophyte classification published in the molecular phylogenetic era. They referred to the ferns (now including horsetails) as monilophytes, dividing them into four groups, with the vast majority of species being placed in a taxon they called &quot;Polypodiopsida&quot;. The four-fold grouping has persisted through subsequent systems, despite changes in nomenclature. Polypodiopsida is now used for all ferns (&quot;sensu lato&quot;), with Smith et al.&#x27;s group being subclass Polypodiidae. This group, which includes Polypodiales, is also informally known as the leptosporangiate ferns, while the remaining three groups (subclasses) are referred to as eusporangiate ferns. The Polypodiidae have been divided into seven orders, Polypodiales being the largest. The phylogenetic position of Polypodiales in relation to the other orders of Polypodiidae is shown in the following cladogram.
=== Evolution ===
Despite being the most diverse order of ferns, they appeared relatively late in the evolutionary history of the group, during the Early Cretaceous, and diversified substantially throughout the period.

=== Subdivision ===
The division of the Polypodiales into families has changed somewhat between the pioneering work of Smith et al. (2006) and the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group&#x27;s classification of 2016, with a general increase in the number of divisions recognized, albeit sometimes at different ranks. The table below summarizes four systems; families are listed alphabetically within three broad groups. Although the same families are used in more than one system, circumscriptions may differ. Christenhusz and Chase in 2014 used a very broad circumscription of Aspleniaceae and Polypodiaceae, reducing families used in other systems to subfamilies.

Smith et al. (2006) divided the Polypodiales into fifteen families, a practice continued in their 2008 revision, with members of the eupolypods placed in two unranked clades. The families are listed in the table. While many of these families had previously been recognized with similar circumscriptions, the authors noted that Dryopteridaceae was more narrowly bounded than in historical circumscriptions, which had included their Tectariaceae, Onocleaceae and Woodsiaceae. The circumscription of Lomariopsidaceae changed dramatically, with most historical genera of that family (except &quot;Lomariopsis&quot; and &quot;Thysanosoria&quot;) being moved to Dryopteridaceae, while &quot;Cyclopeltis&quot; and &quot;Nephrolepis&quot; were added. Saccolomataceae were removed from the dennstaedtioids. &quot;Cystodium&quot; was tentatively placed in Lindsaeaceae, away from its historical position with the tree ferns. Woodsiaceae was acknowledged to be of uncertain circumscription and perhaps paraphyletic; the inclusion of &quot;Hypodematium&quot;, &quot;Didymochlaena&quot;, and &quot;Leucostegia&quot; perhaps also rendering Dryopteridaceae paraphyletic. The grammitids were included in Polypodiaceae to render that family monophyletic.

The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009), incorporated new phylogenetic evidence to make several changes at the familial level, resulting in an expansion to 23 families. &quot;Lonchitis&quot; and &quot;Cystodium&quot; were removed from the Lindsaeaceae and incorporated into new families, Lonchitidaceae and Cystodiaceae respectively. Within eupolypods I, Woodsiaceae proved to be paraphyletic and was reduced to the genera &quot;Cheilanthopsis&quot;, &quot;Hymenocystis&quot;, and &quot;Woodsia&quot;, while the remainder of its genera were removed to Cystopteridaceae, Diplaziopsidaceae, Rhachidosoraceae, Athyriaceae, and Hemidictyaceae. Within eupolypods II, &quot;Nephrolepis&quot; was placed in a new family, the Nephrolepidaceae, due to uncertainty in its phylogenetic placement, while Hypodematiaceae was split from Dryopteridaceae to contain the three problematic genera mentioned by Smith et al.

The classification of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) dramatically reduced the number of families recognized in this order to eight by &quot;lumping&quot;, reducing many families to subfamilies and expanding the circumscription of Polypodiaceae and Aspleniaceae to encompass all of eupolypods I and eupolypods II, respectively. Former families became subfamilies (see the table above). The former Hemidictyaceae were included in the Asplenioideae, and the Onocleaceae in the Blechnoideae. In the new Polypodiaceae, &quot;Didymochlaena&quot; was placed in its own subfamily, Didymochlaenoideae.

The PPG I classification (2016) used a process intermediate between the two previous approaches, by introducing a new rank, that of suborder, and organising 26 families (in some cases very narrowly circumscribed) into six suborders, largely returning to the families set out by Christenhusz et al. in 2011. In lieu of the expansion of Aspleniaceae and Polypodiaceae, eupolypods I and II were recognized and named as suborders:
*Saccolomatineae includes the single family Saccolomataceae.
*Lindsaeinae corresponds to the Lindseaceae of Smith et al., and includes the Cystodiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, and Lonchitidaceae. It is probably not monophyletic.
*Pteridineae includes the single family Pteridaceae.
*Dennstaedtiineae includes the single family Dennstaedtiaceae.
*Aspleniinae (formerly eupolypods I) includes the families Cystopteridaceae, Rhachidosoraceae, Diplaziopsidaceae, Desmophlebiaceae (containing only &quot;Desmophlebium&quot;), Hemidictyaceae, Aspleniaceae, Woodsiaceae, Onocleaceae, Blechnaceae, Athyriaceae, and Thelypteridaceae.
*Polypodiineae (formerly eupolypods II) includes the families Didymochlaenaceae (containing only &quot;Didymochlaena&quot;), Hypodematiaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Lomariopsidaceae, Nephrolepidaceae, Tectariaceae, Oleandraceae, Davalliaceae, and Polypodiaceae.

===Phylogeny===
===Obsolete families===
Now-obsolete families of Polypodiales include:
* Drynariaceae - now in Polypodiaceae
* Grammitidaceae - now in Polypodiaceae
* Gymnogrammitidaceae - now in Polypodiaceae
* Loxogrammaceae - now in Polypodiaceae
* Platyceriaceae - now in Polypodiaceae
* Pleursoriopsidaceae - now in Polypodiaceae
* Vittariaceae - now in Pteridaceae

=== Evolution ===

Polypodiales may be regarded as one of the most evolutionarily advanced orders of monilophytes (ferns), based on recent genetic analysis. They arose and diversified about 100 million years ago, probably subsequent to the diversification of the angiosperms.

<text>Edward Dean Winter (June 3, 1937 – March 8, 2001) was an American actor. He is best known for his recurring role, Colonel Samuel Flagg, in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; from 1973 to 1979.

His other notable television roles were as U.S. Air Force investigator Capt. Ben Ryan in season 2 of &quot;Project U.F.O.&quot; (1978–1979); and in &quot;Hollywood Beat&quot; (1985), &quot;9 to 5&quot; (1986–1988), and &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; (1991–1994).

Winter received two Tony Awards for Best Featured Actor in a Musical nominations for his performances in the original productions of &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966) and &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (1968). He also appeared in films such as &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; (1980), &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Buddy System&quot; (1984).

==Early career==
Winter was born in Ventura, California and began his acting career in Ashland, Oregon as a member of the cast of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. During the 1961 season, he played Claudius in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and stayed for an extended repertory season where he appeared in &quot;The Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;Rashomon&quot;. He went on to early successes on Broadway. Winter was twice nominated for Tony Awards as Best Supporting or Featured Actor (Musical). The first was in 1967, as Ernst Ludwig in &quot;Cabaret&quot;, then in 1969 as J.D. Sheldrake in &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;. He moved on to television, appearing on the daytime serials &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; and &quot;Somerset&quot;.

==Later career==
Winter was cast on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; as Lt. Col. (later Col.) Flagg, becoming one of the program&#x27;s more memorable and popular recurring characters. He appeared in seven episodes as Flagg during the show&#x27;s 11-year run. The Flagg character was an intelligence agent (claiming to be C.I.A. several times) who brought a stereotypically paranoid, conspiracy-driven approach to his tasks. In some episodes his character was particularly vicious.
Before his introduction as Flagg, Winter had appeared in the Season 2 episode &quot;Deal Me Out&quot; as Cpt. Halloran. A number of fans have expressed the belief that Halloran might have been one of Flagg&#x27;s many aliases, especially as he said to Dr. Freedman, &quot;we played poker once,&quot; which Cpt. Halloran had. However, this is debatable, as Halloran was a reasonably amiable character, whilst every other persona Flagg adopted was highly antagonistic, regardless of the alias. Winter reprised the role of Col. Flagg in an episode of the spin-off series &quot;AfterMASH&quot; in 1984. In 1985 he appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Misfits of Science&quot; as an army officer who is killed trying to stop an insane general, played by Larry Linville.

In 1974, he played a pedophile in the &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; episode &quot;The Outrage&quot;. The same year, he appeared in the films &quot;The Parallax View&quot; and &quot;The Disappearance of Flight 412&quot;. In 1976, he appeared in the crime comedy &quot;Special Delivery&quot;. In 1975, he played Wes Greenfield in &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; as an aspiring insurance company Executive. (Season 3, Episode 6 - The Gray Flannel Shrink). In 1976, he appeared in a season two episode of &quot;Phyllis,&quot; playing a boyfriend of Phyllis who comes out as gay. He also appeared in two memorable episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot; in 1981 as plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Waring, Mitch Cooper&#x27;s mentor. Winter also appeared in the TV show &quot;Alice&quot;, Season 2 Episode 7. He played Alice&#x27;s possible boyfriend, Jack. Winter was a recurring character in the first season of the prime time sitcom &quot;Soap&quot; in 1977–78, portraying Congressman Walter McCallum, who was having an affair with the Tates&#x27; daughter, Eunice. In 1977, Winter appeared in an episode of &quot;Lou Grant&quot; titled &quot;Housewarming,&quot; as a reporter who beat his wife. The same year, he appeared in the popular TV movie &quot;The Gathering&quot;, also starring Ed Asner, and &quot;Never Con a Killer,&quot; the pilot for the crime drama &quot;The Feather and Father Gang&quot;. In 1976, he appeared in &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, in which he played a congressman with a former tie to organized crime. He guest-starred in season one on &quot;The A-Team&quot; in the episode &quot;Holiday in the Hills&quot; and appeared in the season 5 episode &quot;Road Games&quot;.

Winter starred in the 1979 NBC primetime drama &quot;Project UFO&quot; and was featured in the 1980 film &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;. In 1979, Winter played the role of NASA astronaut Commander Buck Fulton in the 2-part episode of &quot;Salvage 1&quot; titled &quot;Golden Orbit.&quot; He appeared as the corrupt county commissioner Bob Gebhardt in the 1983 movie &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot;, the romantic comedy &quot;The Buddy System&quot; (1984), and in &quot;From the Hip&quot; (1987), also directed by &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; director Bob Clark. In 1980 he played Clark Gable in the TV movie &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot;. Winter co-starred in the 1986 TV movie &quot;A Christmas Gift&quot; as Thomas Renfield, with co-star John Denver. Three years later he portrayed Las Vegas entertainer Johnny Roman in &quot;Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All&quot;. He appeared as murder victim Charlton &#x27;Charlie&#x27; Chambers (as Ed Winter) in a 1990 episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo&quot;. Winter had a recurring role on the Fox sitcom &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot; from 1991 to 1994. Winter portrayed Mr. Crawford, an executive at Waterton Publishing. He was featured as the real-life character of Carl Lawson in a 1995 episode of UPN&#x27;s &quot;Real Ghosts&quot;, also known as &quot;Haunted Lives: True Ghost Stories&quot;. He did voice work on such programs as &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;Duckman&quot;, &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Max&quot;, &quot;Paddington Bear&quot; and the animated film &quot;Adventures in Odyssey: Shadow of a Doubt&quot;.

==Death==
On March 8, 2001, Winter died at age 63 in Woodland Hills, California, of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

<text>OpenSecrets is a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, including a revolving door database which documents the individuals who have worked in both the public sector and lobbying firms and may have conflicts of interest. It was created from the 2021 merger of the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) and the National Institute on Money in Politics (NIMP), both of which were organizations that tracked data on campaign finance in the United States and advocated for stricter regulation and disclosure of political donations.

Examples of investigations conducted by the organization include uncovering that Carolina Rising, a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization spent $4.7 million in 2014 on political ads in support of Thom Tillis, Senate candidate from North Carolina, and that the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign was financially related to the rally that preceded the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

The organization is funded by donations; since 2020, the largest donors have been: the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Democracy Fund, the Gaia Fund, Google, the Hewlett Foundation, the Kaphan Foundation, Mertz Gilmore Foundation, the Omidyar Network, Open Society Foundations, the Popplestone Foundation, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. In 2023, the organization reported $2.5 million in revenue and $4.3 million in expenses. In 2024, having serious financial difficulties, OpenSecrets laid off a third of its staff.

==History==
===Center for Responsive Politics===
The Center for Responsive Politics was founded in 1983 by retired U.S. Senators Frank Church of Idaho, of the Democratic Party, and Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, of the Republican Party. In the 1980s, Church and Scott launched a &quot;money-in-politics&quot; project, whose outcome consisted of large, printed books. Their first book, &quot;Spending in Congressional Elections: A Never-Ending Spiral&quot;, published in 1988, analyzed spending patterns in congressional elections from 1974 through 1986, including 1986 soft money contributions in five states. The first data was published by CRP in 1990 and the website OpenSecrets.org was launched in 1996, making the data more readily available.

===National Institute on Money in Politics===
The National Institute on Money in Politics traces its roots to the &quot;Money in Western Politics&quot; project launched in 1991 and funded by the MacArthur Foundation. Prior to 1991, data was not digitized and therefore was not easily available. In 1999, three regional teams merged to form NIMP, based in Helena, Montana. The organization published the Follow The Money website, where it compiled political funding information from government disclosure agencies.

The organization did not receive any government funding and relied on philanthropic efforts; among its donations received was $2.3 million in funding from Open Society Foundations.

===Leadership history===
Sheila Krumholz, who joined the organization in 1989, was the executive director of OpenSecrets and its predecessor from December 2006, having previously served as research director, until December 2023.

<doc id="1291698" wikidata="Q17152628" url="?curid=1291698" title="Optical autocorrelation">
<text>In optics, various autocorrelation functions can be experimentally realized. The field autocorrelation may be used to calculate the spectrum of a source of light, while the intensity autocorrelation and the interferometric autocorrelation are commonly used to &quot;estimate&quot; the duration of ultrashort pulses produced by modelocked lasers. The laser pulse duration cannot be easily measured by optoelectronic methods, since the response time of photodiodes and oscilloscopes are at best of the order of 200 femtoseconds, yet laser pulses can be made as short as a few femtoseconds.

In the following examples, the autocorrelation signal is generated by the nonlinear process of second-harmonic generation (SHG). Other techniques based on two-photon absorption may also be used in autocorrelation measurements, as well as higher-order nonlinear optical processes such as third-harmonic generation, in which case the mathematical expressions of the signal will be slightly modified, but the basic interpretation of an autocorrelation trace remains the same. A detailed discussion on interferometric autocorrelation is given in several well-known textbooks.

==Field autocorrelation==
For a complex electric field formula_1, the field autocorrelation function is defined by

: formula_2
The Wiener-Khinchin theorem states that the Fourier transform of the field autocorrelation is the spectrum of formula_1, i.e., the square of the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the Fourier transform of formula_1. As a result, the field autocorrelation is not sensitive to the spectral &quot;phase&quot;.
The field autocorrelation is readily measured experimentally by placing a slow detector at the output of a Michelson interferometer. The detector is illuminated by the input electric field formula_1 coming from one arm, and by the delayed replica formula_6 from the other arm. If the time response of the detector is much larger than the time duration of the signal formula_1, or if the recorded signal is integrated, the detector measures the intensity formula_8 as the delay formula_9 is scanned:

: formula_10

Expanding formula_11 reveals that one of the terms is formula_12, proving that a Michelson interferometer can be used to measure the field autocorrelation, or the spectrum of formula_1 (and only the spectrum). This principle is the basis for Fourier transform spectroscopy.
==Intensity autocorrelation==
To a complex electric field formula_1 corresponds an intensity formula_15 and an intensity autocorrelation function defined by

: formula_16

The optical implementation of the intensity autocorrelation is not as straightforward as for the field autocorrelation. Similarly to the previous setup, two parallel beams with a variable delay are generated, then focused into a second-harmonic-generation crystal (see nonlinear optics) to obtain a signal proportional to formula_17. Only the beam propagating on the optical axis, proportional to the cross-product formula_18, is retained. This signal is then recorded by a slow detector, which measures

: formula_19

formula_11 is exactly the intensity autocorrelation formula_12.

The generation of the second harmonic in crystals is a nonlinear process that requires high peak power, unlike the previous setup. However, such high peak power can be obtained from a limited amount of energy by ultrashort pulses, and as a result their intensity autocorrelation is often measured experimentally. Another difficulty with this setup is that both beams must be focused at the same point inside the crystal &quot;as the delay is scanned&quot; in order for the second harmonic to be generated.

It can be shown that the intensity autocorrelation width of a pulse is related to the intensity width. For a Gaussian time profile, the autocorrelation width is formula_22 longer than the width of the intensity, and it is 1.54 longer in the case of a hyperbolic secant squared (sech2) pulse. This numerical factor, which depends on the shape of the pulse, is sometimes called the &quot;deconvolution factor&quot;. If this factor is known, or assumed, the time duration (intensity width) of a pulse can be measured using an intensity autocorrelation. However, the phase cannot be measured.
==Interferometric autocorrelation==
As a combination of both previous cases, a nonlinear crystal can be used to generate the second harmonic at the output of a Michelson interferometer, in a &quot;collinear geometry&quot;. In this case, the signal recorded by a slow detector is

: formula_23

formula_11 is called the interferometric autocorrelation. It contains some information about the phase of the pulse: the fringes in the autocorrelation trace wash out as the spectral phase becomes more complex.


==Pupil function autocorrelation==
The optical transfer function &quot;T&quot;(&quot;w&quot;) of an optical system is given by the autocorrelation of its pupil function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;):

:formula_25

<doc id="1291703" wikidata="Q188122" url="?curid=1291703" title="Juan Pablo Duarte">
<text>Juan Pablo Duarte y Díez (January 26, 1813 – July 15, 1876) was a Dominican military leader, writer, activist, and nationalist politician who was the foremost of the Founding Fathers of the Dominican Republic and bears the title of Father of the Nation. As one of the most celebrated figures in Dominican history, Duarte is considered a folk hero and revolutionary visionary in the modern Dominican Republic, who along with military generals Ramón Matías Mella and Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, organized and promoted La Trinitaria, a secret society that eventually led to the Dominican revolt and independence from Haitian rule in 1844 and the start of the Dominican War of Independence.

Born into a middle-upper class family in 1813, his childhood was engulfed in several administrative changes in Santo Domingo. He was a toddler during the years of España Boba, which came to an end with the proclamation of José Núñez de Cáceres, who declared the first independence of Santo Domingo in 1821. Not long after this, Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer invaded the country, establishing a military occupation that would last for 22 years. This period was ravaged with economic and social repression. Duarte&#x27;s desire for knowledge and his dreams of improvement led him to Europe, where he strengthened his liberal ideas. These ideas formulated the outline for establishing an independent Dominican state. Upon returning, he voluntarily dedicated himself to teaching in the streets, improvising a school in his father&#x27;s business, determined that the people of his era assimilate his ideals of revolutionary enlightenment. In 1834, Duarte became an officer in the Haitian National Guard, rising to the rank of colonel.

In 1843 he participated in the &quot;Reformist Revolution&quot; against Boyer in favor of Charles Rivière-Hérard. However, the new president issued a manhunt for Duarte, forcing him to flee the island. In the meantime, two of his most prominent followers, Francisco del Rosario Sánchez and Matías Ramón Mella, continued the fight for independence, which had finally been achieved on February 27, 1844. Having returned in time to take part in the Dominican War of Independence, he was immediately acquired into the new government. As a member of the Central Governing Board, he originally rejected a proposal to take the presidency by his followers. On June 9, 1844, he launched the 18 Dominican Brumaire against said institution that would dismiss most of its members, becoming, after that, the first inspector general of the national troops. He would accept being proclaimed president by his supporters in the Cibao, which would earn him being declared &quot;a traitor and unfaithful to the Homeland&quot; and being expelled from the country by the then government presided over by the landowner Pedro Santana.

Duarte lived in exile in Venezuela due to the political and military conflicts that existed in the Dominican Republic, which constituted a serious danger to his life. In Venezuela, he was received and welcomed making this land his second home. He maintained a relatively low profile in the Venezuelan jungle, moving from city to city, though he gradually emerged from recluse by the early 1860s. However, he returned to Caracas in 1862 to raise funds and return to the Dominican Republic upon learning of the annexation to Spain. By the time of the outbreak of the Dominican Restoration War, he returned to his homeland but the restoring Government of Dominican President José Antonio Salcedo asked him to return to Venezuela on a diplomatic mission as Plenipotentiary Minister to request the support of the Government of Venezuelan President Juan Crisóstomo Falcón to the cause of the restoration of Dominican Independence. Duarte, although not very much in agreement with the mission, returned to Caracas and fulfilled as much as possible. After completing his diplomatic mission, he stayed to live in this country where he died in Caracas on July 15, 1876.

== Early years ==
Duarte was born on January 26, 1813 in Santo Domingo, Captaincy General of Santo Domingo during the period commonly called &quot;España Boba&quot;. In his memoirs, La Trinitaria member described Duarte as a man with a rosy complexion, sharp features, blue eyes, and a golden hair that contrasted with his thick, dark moustache. Duarte was born into a middle-class family that was dedicated to maritime trade and hardware in the port area of Santo Domingo. His father was Juan José Duarte Rodríguez, a Peninsular from Vejer de la Frontera, Kingdom of Seville, Spain, and his mother was Manuela Díez Jiménez from El Seibo, Captaincy General of Santo Domingo; three of Duarte&#x27;s grandparents were Europeans. Duarte had 9 siblings: his eldest brother, (1802–1865), a tall, long-haired brunette man, was a store owner, woodcutter and cattle rancher who was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico; one of Duarte&#x27;s sisters was Rosa Protomártir Duarte (1820–1888), a performer who collaborated with him within the Independence movement. 

In 1801 the Duarte family migrated from Santo Domingo to Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. They were evading the unrest caused by the Haitian Revolution in the island. Many Dominican families left the island during this period. Toussaint Louverture, governor of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), a former colony of France located on the western third of Hispaniola, arrived to the capital of Santo Domingo, located on the island&#x27;s eastern two-thirds, the previous year and proclaimed the end of slavery (although the changes were not permanent). At the time, France and Saint-Domingue (the western third of the island), were going through exhaustive social movements, namely, the French Revolution and the Haitian Revolution. In occupying the Spanish side of the island L&#x27;Ouverture was using as a pretext the previous agreements between the governments of France and Spain in the Peace of Basel signed in 1795, which had given the Spanish area to France. Louverture wanted to convert the old Spanish institutions to French and re-establish the plantation economy on both sides of the island.
Upon arrival in Santo Domingo Norte, L&#x27;Ouverture immediately sought to abolish slavery in Dominican territory, even lthough though slavery was abolished in 1821 per Spanish Haiti constitution. Puerto Rico was still a Spanish colony, and Mayagüez, being so close to Hispaniola, just across the Mona Passage, had become a refuge for wealthy migrants from Santo Domingo like the Duartes and other native born on the Spanish side who did not accept Haitian dictatorship. Most scholars assume that the Duartes&#x27; first son, Vicente Celestino, was born here at this time on the eastern side of the Mona Passage. The family returned to Santo Domingo in 1809, however, after the Spanish reconquest of Santo Domingo, led by governor- general Juan Sánchez Ramírez, that decisively crushed French rule in Santo Domingo, but returned to Spanish rule.
In 1819, Duarte enrolled in Manuel Aybar&#x27;s school where he learned reading, writing, grammar and arithmetic. He was a disciple of Dr. Juan Vicente Moscoso from whom he obtained his higher education in Latin, philosophy and law, due to the closure of the university by the Haitian authorities. After the exile of Dr. Moscoso to Cuba, his role was continued by the priest Gaspar Hernández.

==Ephemeral Independence==
===First Dominican independence, 1821===
In December 1821, when Duarte was eight years old, members of a Creole elite of Santo Domingo&#x27;s capital proclaimed its independence from Spanish rule, calling themselves &quot;Haití Español&quot;. Historians today call this elite&#x27;s brief courtship with sovereignty the Ephemeral Independence. The most prominent leader of the coup against Spanish colonial government was one of its former supporters, José Núñez de Cáceres. These individuals were tired of being ignored by the Crown, and some were also concerned with the new liberal turn in Madrid.
Their deed was not an isolated event. The 1820s was a time of profound political changes throughout the entire Spanish Atlantic World, which affected directly the lives of middle-class like the Duartes. It began with the conflictive period between Spanish royalists and liberals in the Iberian Peninsula, which is known today as the &quot;Trienio Liberal&quot;. American patriots in arms, like Simón Bolívar in South America, immediately reaped the fruits of Spain&#x27;s destabilization, and began pushing back colonial troops. Even conservative elites in New Spain (like Agustín de Iturbide in Mexico), who had no intention of being ruled by Spanish anticlericals, moved to break ties with the crown in Spain.

Many others in Santo Domingo wanted independence from Spain for reasons much closer to home. Inspired by the revolution and independence on the island, Dominicans mounted a number of different movements and conspiracies in the period from 1809 to 1821 against slavery and colonialism.
The Cáceres provisional government requested support from Simón Bolivar&#x27;s new government, but their petition was ignored given the internal conflicts of the Gran Colombia.

===Annexation by Haiti===
Meanwhile, a plan for unification with Haiti grew stronger. Haitian politicians wanted to keep the island out of the hands of European imperial powers and thus a way to safeguard the Haitian Revolution . Haiti&#x27;s President Jean-Pierre Boyer sent an army that took over the eastern portion of Hispaniola. The Spaniards residing in Santo Domingo, especially those of Catalan origin, welcomed the country&#x27;s incorporation into the Republic of Haiti. Thus, when Boyer arrived in the city at the head of his troops, the Spanish traders sent him a letter in which they adhered to the new order that was implemented. However, Duarte&#x27;s father was the one of the Spanish merchants in the city who refused to sign the document and, according to several documents, he chose to get involved in separatist conspiracies that tried to take shape during the initial years of Haitian domination, though it never materialized.

On January 6, 1823, Boyer decreed that all young men between the ages of 16 and 25 would be drafted into the Haitian army. This measure caused the University of Santo Domingo to lose its students and consequently had to close its doors. On November 14, 1824, Boyer established French as the official, sole and obligatory language in the acts of the Courts, the Civil Registry and public notaries throughout the island. Struggles between Boyer and the old colonial helped produce a migration of planters and elite. Following the bourgeoisie custom of sending promising sons abroad for education, the Duartes sent Juan Pablo to the United States and Europe in 1828 .

=== Revolutionary origins ===

For his trip, Duarte was accompanied by Pablo Pujols, a Catalan merchant who was also a family friend of the Duartes. Pujols had lived in the country for some time, and for the trip, he agreed to be the tutor for the young Duarte. However, as Duarte boarded the ship, the captain reproached the two travelers due to the fact that the inhabitants of the Spanish part of the island were now living under Haitian domination. He even asserted that he would only board him unless Duarte told him that he felt no shame in being &quot;Haitian.&quot; Although Duarte responded that he was Dominican, the captain harshly boasted that the Dominicans were cowards for submitting to Haitian yoke, and therefore, was undeserving of an identity, expressing the following words: &quot;You have no name, because neither you nor your parents deserve to have one, because, cowardly and servile, they bow their heads under the time of their slaves.&quot; This moment completely moved the still teenaged Duarte, who would readdres years later that these humiliating words led him at that very moment to the resolution to fight for Dominican Independence. He then assured the captain that he would not rest until his people were free.

==Era of Enlightenment==

Duarte left the country for the first time for Spain as a teenager. Before coming to Europe, where he would go to study, he spent a brief time in the United States. Although it is believed that he entered North America through New York, another version indicates that he did so through Providence, Rhode Island, on July 2, 1829, and that from there he went to the city known today as the Big Apple. In New York he studied English, a language Mr. Groot had introduced him to in Santo Domingo. In addition, as noted by Rosa Duarte in &quot;Notes&quot;, he began to study Universal Geography with Mr. W. Davis, who gave him classes at his own residence. According to historian, Pedro Troncoso Sánchez, while in England, specifically Southampton, from where Duarte would go to London was his gateway to Europe, he would study philosophy, history, law, political science and geography. His continued on to France, where he arrived at Le Havre and then touched Paris. It was there that he perfected his French, a language he had studied in Santo Domingo by Monsieur Bruat. While attending a banquet in Hamburg, through a lodge called Oriente, he was introduced to Freemasonry, absorbing ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity.

In Europe, convulsed in the era of romanticism, liberalism, nationalism and utopian socialism, it was engulfed with revolutionary atmospheres at the time. Numerous political and social events that shook several European nations in the second and third decades of the 19th century. Such events included those in Portugal (expulsion in 1811 of the French troops by the British under the command of the Duke of Wellington; the English military occupation until in 1822 King John VI returned from Brazil and accepted a liberal constitution), Belgium (1795–1815 France occupies it; in 1815 unification with the United Provinces; 1830 the secession of Holland and independence of the Belgian provinces), and Italy (political upheavals after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte). Duarte was also curious to learn of the events iin Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Mexico, among other nations, after Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain in 1808, further influencing his liberal ideals towards his own country. Presumably, Duarte knew that General Rafael del Riego, a Spanish soldier and politician, fought against the occupation of Spain by France in 1808, a general who introduced Masonic principles into military barracks, Masonic principles that both attracted Duarte throughout his life. The Spanish events of 1808 and the death of General Riego in 1823 by hanging, as presumed, were discussed when Duarte arrived in Spain in 1828 and must have captured his attention in a decisive manner.

Also upon Duarte&#x27;s arrival in Spain, the events of the Liberal Triennium (1820–1823) were very fresh, when on March 9, 1820, General del Riego led a military movement that forced King Ferdinand VII to swear an oath on July 9, as constitutional king, a government in which the liberals played an important role. The fight for independence in America, the support of Ferdinand VII for the return to absolutism and the invasion of the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis sponsored by the Holy Alliance, caused the collapse of the liberal government and the return to absolutism on October 1, 1823. The study of these events must have been very important for Duarte. As Duarte was in Spain, the events of the July Revolution of 1830 occurred in Paris, where the figure of the Spanish liberal José de Espronceda moved incessantly in the trenches to allow liberalism in France to achieve victory against the conservatives who advocated that the Bourbons will continue with the absolutist regime.

Having thrown himself into these scenes of European radicalism, Duarte himself had the pleasure of witnessing the new regimes of liberty and rights that had arisen after the French Revolution; He was intrigued by the new changes produced in Germany and France, but none was caught his interest more that that of Spain, of which reforms introduced by Cortes of Cádiz. He would remain in Barcelona for the rest of his travels, where it is believed that he studied law. According to military historian, Rafael Percival Peña, Duarte also acquired some military training during his time in Spain.

It was then that his political ideology began to take shape, in which nationalism and liberalism merged on a romantic background: Duarte understood that the Dominican people had their own identity and had the absolute right to bring about political independence. Since the beginning of the 16th century, the Dominicans, despite the economic disadvantages, have a history of rebelling and triumphing battles against Dutch, British, French, and Spanish forces, (the latter two of which in recent decades, were expelled from Santo Domingo by Dominican rebels in 1809 and 1821 respectively). This time, Duarte firmly believed that the Dominicans would now have to rise up arms against the fierce might of the Haitians. Upon the success of this goal, the newly independent nation would be organized on the basis of the institutionalism of representative democracy. Having formalized these ideals, the enlightened Duarte returned to his homeland In 1833. From Barcelona he arrived in Puerto Rico, then to Saint Thomas, and from this island, to his native country.

With his return, Duarte returned to his hometown of Santo Domingo, where he devotes himself to putting his newly formed ideals to test, while at the same time, working in his father&#x27;s business. According to historian Orlando Inoa, backed by records from the lodge named Constante Union No. 8, a lodge that was chartered through the Grand Oriente of Haiti, Duarte became a freemason at the legal age of 21. He was said to have been appointed as the Architect Decorator of this lodge. (It is believed by some historians that some of his key collaboraters were also members of this lodge). He had even joined the Haitian National Guard, furthering his military training, as well as studying the military tactics of occupying forces. He eventually reached the rank of colonel.

He leads an intense social life that allows him to come into contact with many important sectors of the urban communities. He witnessed marriages, sponsors, baptisms and attended meetings of a cultural nature. This experience of society is what moved him to realize that within the population, there is a patriotic feeling that rejects the Haitian presence in the country. His merit, not only as a patriot, but also as a political organizer, lies fundamentally in the fact that he was well aware of the historic moment that accumulated in Dominican society at that time; the reluctance of its most decisive layers to accept Haitian rule, of which by now was becoming more despotic and unruly.

His ideas found greater echo within the middle class. While cultivating his spirit, Duarte did not stop transmitting the knowledge he acquired to the youth of his native city. For four consecutive years, from 1834 to 1838, he offered language and mathematics classes to a group of humble young people who went every afternoon to the warehouse located on La Atarazana street. The young master&#x27;s popularity grew among a large part of the population. Many of his disciples began to feel a fervent attachment to him. In a short time the La Atarazana warehouse becomes the headquarters of a revolutionary junta. Duarte&#x27;s word has penetrated the hearts of a group of young idealists and little by little the wills of all have merged into a common aspiration: that of separating the Dominican part of the island from the Haitian part. Duarte launched the idea and it was enthusiastically received by those of his disciples who had stood out the most for their fervor for the principles he preached and those who testified to his most self-sacrificing fidelity.

==Struggle for independence==
But what could have been a traditionalist reaction in those young people, thanks to Duarte, was headed towards the formation of a democratic-revolutionary nucleus. Perhaps the key was in the fact that they were all young. The repudiation of oppression, without commitment to the past, made them receptive to Duarte&#x27;s preachings. The conglomerate of friends, united under his guidance in the activity of study and intellectual reflection, was the antecedent of the revolutionary organization formed years later. These activities were strengthened upon the arrival to the country of Peruvian priest Gaspar Hernández, appointed parish priest of San Carlos, with high intellectual training, who organized a philosophy study group in 1842. However, Hernández had no responsibility in the patriotic and revolutionary leadership of the group of young people, since he was a supporter of the return of Spanish rule.

===Founding of &quot;La Trinitaria&quot;===
On July 16, 1838, in the place of Arzobispo Nouel Street, (in front of the Church of Carmen), Duarte and others established a secret patriotic society called La Trinitaria, which helped undermine Haitian occupation. Named after the Holy Trinity, this movement, as described by his sister Rosa, was referred as a youth movement, due to the fact that most of the members were very young. Some of its first members included Juan Isidro Pérez, Pedro Alejandro Pina, Jacinto de la Concha, Félix María Ruiz, José María Serra, Benito González, Felipe Alfau and Juan Nepomuceno Ravelo. La Trinitaria was an organization that had no precedent in the country: the first revolutionary group animated by a political doctrine, with a program and an organizational system. Its raison d&#x27;etre lay in realizing the objective that Duarte had preached: overthrowing Haitian rule to found an independent State. As can be read in the oath, the entity was organized around fidelity to the person of Duarte. The teachings of the founding father summarized the doctrine and program of the society. The Trinitarian movement, said his sister Rosa Duarte, was known as the “boys&#x27; revolution” because of the youth of almost everyone. Conservatives viewed them with distrust and ridicule for their disinterested idealism. They coined the derogatory neologism “filorios”, a word that came from philosophers, which meant to denote that they were romantics lacking realism.

Contrary to this vision, Duarte provided La Trinitaria with the practical and organizational resources necessary to achieve its objectives. You can associate La Trinitaria with the Masonic tradition and the libertarian organizations of the Mediterranean countries that advocated the implementation of liberal regimes, such as the Carbonarians of Italy. Its main distinguishing feature was the secrecy that was to guide the activities. It was equipped with a cellular organization, according to which each nucleus of conspirators had to exist as a body independent of the rest. It was conceived, therefore, as a chain of conspirators that converged in the first initiates: each of them had to create a cell with two more members and, in turn, each of these created other cells with the incorporation of two new adepts. But each member only had to know the members of the cells to which he belonged.

====&quot;La Filantrópica&quot; and &quot;La Dramática&quot;====
Later, Duarte and others founded a society called &quot;La Filantrópica&quot;, which had a more public presence, seeking to spread veiled ideas of liberation through theatrical stages. This group went by the motto &quot;Peace, Union, and Friendship.&quot; Some of their plays included: &quot;Free Rome&quot; by Italian playwright Vittorio Alfieri, &quot;La Viuda de Padilla&quot; by Francisco Martínez de la Rosa, &quot;A Day of the year 23 in Cádiz&quot; by Eugenio de Ochoa. The Haitian governor, Bernard-Philippe-Alexis Carrié, at first, wasn&#x27;t suspectuful, so he ignored the performances. But the public flocked to the theater with such enthusiasm and the actors caused such delirium in the audience that Alexis Carrié was alerted by his spies. The first impulse of the occupation authorities was to suspend the activities of the movement and close the theater. After several failed attempts, the unsatisfied Trinitarios founded &quot;La Dramática.&quot; In this new society, all the members devoted themselves to acting. Many of the people enjoyed these activities and at the same time, learned through the representation of theatrical works they directed. They staged the struggle of a people to free themselves from an oppressive government.

===Brief alliance with the Haitians===

The years 1842-1843 are defining for the creation of propitious conditions that culminated with the moment for Dominican independence. Catastrophic natural phenomena such as the earthquake that affected Haiti on May 7, 1842, which left the northern city of Cap-Haïtian practically destroyed and that it equally affected Santiago and other northern cities in the eastern part. Nearly 5,000 deaths were recorded in said earthquake and accusations of incapacity and insensitivity of the authorities in handling said natural event that influenced the beginning of its political deterioration that had already begun before. Added as a catastrophe, there was a fire in Port-au-Prince that left it in ruins in January 1843, and a political unrest that had been gaining ground was combined with shortages and the economic-commercial crisis that accompanied it. The political attrition of Jean-Pierre Boyer produces ruptures within Haiti and also in the eastern part of the island with separatist movements that sought to overthrow Boyer on one side, and on the other side, sought to make the Spanish part of the island take the opportunity to gain independence.

There were coincidences and differences in purposes. For Duarte, he felt that a shudder was needed, since the Trinitarios could not manage to transfer its influence from the circle of young people to the upper urban sector. This allowed them to move to shift their attentions towards a new movement: La Reforma. Upon learning of the conspiracy led by deposed liberal deputies in Les Cayes and other parts of the South, he arranged for Matías Ramón Mella to move to that region and reach agreements with Boyer&#x27;s enemies. Mella fulfilled his duty, and after a brief visit, he returned to Santo Domingo a day before the insurrection that began of January 27, 1843. After military operations, Boyer resigned on March 13, 1843.

Nearly two weeks later, news reached Santo Domingo about Boyer&#x27;s fall. Following this, a mobilization of the Trinitarios and the Haitian liberals residing in the city hurled into the streets in repudiation of despotism and hailed Dominican triumph. The conservatives, however, were disturbed by this union, accusing Duarte of being &quot;Colombian,&quot; alluding to the prior independence leader, José Núñez de Caceres. In response to this, Duarte strongly emphasized that independence was not what was sought at that time, but the Reformation. (Duarte, who wanted to carry out his plan discrete, alluded this for the purpose of not publicly speaking of the true conditions of proclamation for independence).

Meanwhile, the Haitian authorities of the city, headed by Governor Carrié, opposed the popular movement and a shootout occurred in the Plaza de Armas (today Parque Colón) when the crowd approached his residence to demand his resignation. Many protesters hid, while others, like Duarte, marched towards San Cristóbal, where important conspirators were located. In that town, they received reinforcements from other places in the south, causing Carrié to resign from office. Étienne Desgrotte, the leader of the Haitian liberals in Santo Domingo, was appointed governor. After this, a popular board was formed by Alcius Ponthieux, who assigned Duarte, in addition to Pedro Alejandro Piña and Manuel Jiménes, as members to the board. Duarte was entrusted with the mission of expanding the work to the localities from the east.

Divergences soon emerged between the Haitian liberals and the Dominican liberals. On the occasion of the holding of elections for the designation of legislative representatives, three tendencies competed: the Dominican conservatives, the Dominican liberals and the Haitian liberals. Despite the little relationship that the Trinidadians had with the people, they triumphed in those elections because they embodied the desire for freedom of the most conscious sectors of the Dominican population. Additionally, days before the request had been sent to the Haitian authorities that the official documents be written in Spanish, since the Dominicans could not be treated as a conquered people. This alerted Haitian liberals about what the Dominicans were after.

Despite the struggle between liberals and conservatives, some of the latter understood that it was necessary to reach an agreement with the Trinitarios, since they alone lacked the strength to achieve a break with Haiti. To this end, meetings were held between Duarte and conservative personalities, in search of unity of action. The conservatives demanded concessions contrary to Dominican sovereignty that Duarte considered inadmissible, which is why the negotiations reached a stalemate. However, the Trinitarios continued to try to gather greater support from various sectors and did not renounce unity, as long as the objective of a fully independent State was maintained. Duarte himself, in the work of the Popular Board, managed to incorporate the brothers Ramón and Pedro Santana, two of the most influential landowners in the eastern region, recognized for their opposition to the Haitian yoke. Duarte spoke with Ramón Santana, of patriotic inclinations, who declined the proposal to be named colonel because he understood that this position should correspond to his brother Pedro, with a vocation for command. Duarte later sent Sánchez to ratify the agreement, as he was a personal friend of the Santana brothers. This episode, undoubtedly true, shows that, despite the dispute between Trinitarians and French people, agreements were made between some of the latter and the movement of the former.

==Birth of a new nation==
===First exile and declaration of independence===

This alliance of purposes, however, did not last long. The true motives of Duarte had reached the ears of Charles Rivière-Hérard, who responded with the call of repression of the revolutionaries on the eastern side of the island. The fights started as a result of these differences produced the reaction of the new Haitian government and under the command of Hérard, he launched it against the Trinitarios, commanding two battalions that accompanied him from the city of Port-au-Prince.

During the month of July 1843, the military forces of the Haitian Government intensified the persecution against the Trinitarios. On July 24, 1843, the residence of the family of Juan Pablo Duarte and that of his uncle José Díez, were raided by Haitian soldiers who were trying to locate the Trinitarian leader. The requisition was led by the Haitian commander Hipólito Franquil, who, according to Rosa Duarte, &quot;was accompanied by a large troop of which one part surrounded the block and the other entered the house divided into two rows of two in background; a line of armed soldiers entered through the main bedroom into the inner rooms; and the other extended from the street through the room to the corrals.&quot; That day, Duarte and several of his companions managed to escape by jumping through the patios of neighboring residences until they reached the house of Mr. Teodoro Ariza. They later moved to Pajarito, (present day Villa Duarte, Santo Domingo Este), where they took refuge in the house of Spanish citizen Pascual C. López. They left there at 10 p.m. that same day. Eventually, Duarte had received information from one of his &quot;repentant persecutors&quot; that his head had a price and for this reason, the person who gave him the confidence suggested that he leave Santo Domingo. According to the informant, the Haitian government gave three thousand pesos and the colonel&#x27;s epaulette &quot;for the leader of the revolution,&quot; but many believed that the amount of the offer was low. Duarte and Pedro Alejandrino Pina left the Pedro Cote residence, in the company of Juan Alejandro Acosta and another friend that Rosa Duarte does not identify. Finally, on August 2, 1843, Duarte decided to leave the island for Curaçao due to his insurgent behavior, where he was surprised by the news of his father&#x27;s death on 25 November of that year. Then, Duarte tells his mother to sell the family business to finance the separatist revolution, to which his mother is opposed at first.

In his absence, Francisco del Rosario Sánchez had to take the reins of the separatist movement and make an alliance with the conservative sector headed by Tomás Bobadilla and Buenaventura Báez, resulting in the Manifesto of January 16, 1844. All of this, along with the help of many who wanted to get rid of the Haitians who ruled over the Dominicans, triumphed, as the Dominicans successfully expelled the Haitians out of the country, leading to the proclamation of independence on February 27, 1844. In accordance to Duarte&#x27;s wishes, a new republican government, once again free of foreign control, was established, and Independent Santo Domingo was officially renamed as the &quot;Dominican Republic&quot;.

=== First return to Dominican Republic ===

With the purpose of preparing the return of Duarte, a commission was formed, headed by Juan Nepomuceno Ravelo, in charge of bringing the patrician back to his homeland. Four days later, on March 15, 1844, Duarte entered the Port of Santo Domingo, where he was acclaimed by the people. With him, he brought weapons and war materials that he was able to obtain on a trip to Curaçao. His presence caused great joy among his followers and he was received by a procession that paid him the honors of a head of state. Archbishop Tomás Portes Infante greeted the Patrician with these effusive words: &quot;Save the Father of the Nation!&quot; Duarte was proclaimed General in Chief of the Armies of the Republic, but the Government appointed him Brigadier General and Member of the Central Government Junta. He began working on his project to develop a Constitution, which he left unfinished, to join the army and face the Haitians, in the Battle of Azua, on March 19, 1844. During the development of this battle, contradictions began between Santana and Duarte, since Santana, a very influential person due to his status as a herd owner, had little military experience and for the first time had to face such a powerful army. He considered it imperative to obtain a resounding military success against the Haitians, and asked to be appointed to the southern front, where he was assigned as a general associated with Santana. Already in Baní, Duarte advocated an offensive tactic that was rejected by Santana, who was always characterized by adopting defensive military postures. Duarte&#x27;s subordinate officers encouraged him to take the offensive on his own, ignoring Santana&#x27;s position, but he preferred to follow the instructions of the Government Board. Given the disagreements with Santana, on April 4 the Board summoned him back to Santo Domingo, in obvious disapproval of his position. Despite that, Santana defeated the Haitians in the development of this battle. News reached the capital city that the Haitians were advancing towards the Cibao area. On March 30, 1844, the Battle of Santiago took place and after long hours of combat, the Dominican forces inflicted a crushing defeat on Haitian forces.

===Drafted constitution of 1844===

Although Duarte was supported by many as a candidate for the presidency and Mella even declared him president, Duarte declined arguing that he would only accept the position if the majority election of the Dominicans voted in his flavored. Instead, Tomas Bobadilla took office. Duarte was supported by many as a candidate for the presidency of the new-born Republic. Mella wanted Duarte to simply declare himself president. Duarte never giving up on the principles of democracy and fairness by which he lived, would only accept if voted in by a majority of the Dominican people. Duarte had a definite concept of the Dominican nation and its members. His conception of a republic was that of a republican, abolitionist, anticolonial, liberal and progressive patriot.

At that time he drafted a constitution that clearly states that the Dominican flag can shelter all races, without excluding or giving predominance to any. In his project for the Constitution, Duarte wrote that National Independence was the source of liberties and raised the need for Dominicans to have a fundamental law, in order to govern. The constitutional thought of Duarte expressed his most advanced conception regarding the organization of the State as a supreme organ of power.
One of the most important provisions contained in its draft Constitution says, among other things:
Another very important part is the one that refers to the Powers of the State, whose division he conceives, in tripartite form in three parts, putting the Municipal Power, together with the Legislative, judicial and Executive powers. This disposition reveals the spirit of good sense and justice that always accompanied Duarte. It was intended to prevent rulers from making use of unlimited power, which could harm majorities.

The constitutional ideas embodied in his Draft Constitution reflect the influence received by Duarte from the European ideologies of the 18th and 19th centuries. The conceptions expressed in this project allude that Duarte knew the works &quot;The Social Contract,&quot; by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot; by Montesquieu. In addition, American thinkers who inspired the United States Constitution of 1787 influenced the formation of Duarte&#x27;s ideals, such as Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine.

===Clashes with the Central Government Board===

While these events were taking place, differences within the government continued to develop, as the group of conservatives continued their conspiracies for new protectorate plans. The Trinitarios, motivated by the fear that this situation caused them, requested that Duarte be appointed General in Chief of the Army, as well as other important positions for some Trinitarios. Thanks to the conservative hegemony in the Central Government Board, on March 8 that body had taken the resolution to partially adopt a plan that had been outlined in the capital of Haiti by the consul general of France and several Dominican representatives when they were participating in the Constituent Assembly that had been held as a result of the triumph of La Reforma. The Levausser plan stipulated the appointment of a French governor as executive of the Dominican State, with which the country would remain in the status of French protectorate. It also stipulated the cession to France in perpetuity of the Samaná peninsula and active aid to France in the event that it decided to reconquer its former colony in the west of the island. The justification for this resolution was based on the Haitian military threat. In the months of March to May, the conservative leaders placed all their expectations on French aid. Francisco del Rosario Sánchez foresaw that several of the conservatives could lose their lives in the movement and warned them of the scope of the plan so that they would have time to seek asylum in the French consulate, as several later did.

The Trinitarios had initiated the plan to overthrow the members of the Central Government Board, at the end of May 1844, because they understood that they endangered national sovereignty. As part of the project, on May 31, 1844, Juan Pablo Duarte and a group of his followers began a plan with the purpose of taking power in the nascent Dominican Republic, because it had fallen into the hands of the conservative groups represented by the President of the Central Government Board, Tomás Bobadilla, who favored the idea that the Nation would become a protectorate of France.

That same day, Duarte and a group of followers met with the garrison of the Ozama Fortress, and managed to get 56 active officers to sign a document addressed to the Central Government Board, to request that Duarte be named General in Chief of the Army, and the other Trinitarios, including the heroes Francisco del Rosario Sánchez and Matías Ramón Mella, were named Division Generals or Brigadier Generals. The only one who was accepted for promotion was José Joaquín Puello, however some Seybanos along with the friends and supporters of Major General Santana, outraged by the requests, spoke out against it, causing the Board to postpone the Duartistas&#x27; request. On June 1, 1844, Duarte would rejoin the Junta, now headed by President José María Caminero, and signed the request for protection and recognition of independence by France. The new request for French protectorate no longer included the transfer of the Samaná peninsula in perpetuity, instead it was replaced by a provisional occupation by French forces of Samaná bay if necessary.

=== 18 Dominican Brumaire ===
Secretly, however, Duarte and Puello formed a conspiracy that would stage a coup to overthrow José María Caminero. Duarte and Puello had the support of between 150 and 200 officers who had been former slaves. These freedman joined their entourage because they were convinced that their freedom was threatened by the Board after the Duartistas told them that supporters of the protectorate wanted to sell the country to the French and restore slavery. Duarte was in a position to carry out the coup, since Brigadier General Ramón Santana, who was feared by Puello&#x27;s supporters, was in a critical state of health, and in addition, the French warship &quot;Naiade&quot; was absent.

On June 31, 1844, in the morning, Duarte gave a speech to the troops gathered in the arsenal of the Ozama Fortress and the officers of his General Staff where he proclaimed Puello as brigadier general and, in turn, proclaimed Duarte as inspector general of the Dominican troops; General Puello took charge of the city and moved to the Junta upon hearing the shouts: &quot;Down with Bobadilla!&quot; Down Caminero! Death to the traitors! &quot;Death to Delmonte, Javier Abreu, Francisco Ruiz and Báez!&quot; The commander of the department of Santo Domingo, Manuel Jimenes, decided to appear before the Board to obtain from it, voluntarily or by force, the ratification of the coup along with the expulsion of Caminero and Bobadilla, forcing them at the same time to the signing of a ban list. Duarte and Puello then led twenty officers to the Junta and there, in the name of the people and the troops, they imposed their appointments, obtaining, almost without resistance, the sanction of everything they had just done.

This new Junta, now headed by Sánchez, would introduce Pérez and Pina among its members. Duarte was now in control of the government.

=== Proclamation as president ===

Sánchez was appointed President and other members of the Cabinet were Pedro Alejandro Pina, Manuel María Valverde, Juan Isidro Pérez and Duarte himself. Now, the task of the Trinitarians was focused on discarding the influence of Santana and fighting against the actions of the group made up of conservatives. This was not possible because Santana had great influence in the government. Pedro Santana, aware of the military coup, wrote to the Central Government Board, requesting a medical license to retire from the army, on the pretext that he was suffering from an illness.

Meanwhile, Buenaventura Báez and other conspirators communicated frequently with Santana and made a deal to get him approved for sick leave. General Sánchez was appointed assistant chief of Santana, but he was unable to fulfill that mission. Santana began preparing his plot and organized troops made up of his friends. He went to the city of Santo Domingo, with the purpose of &quot;restoring order.&quot; After these events, on July 4, 1844, in the city of Santiago, Mella, who was Commander of the Department of Cibao, oblivious to what was happening in Azua with Santana, proclaimed Juan Pablo Duarte, President of the Republic. Duarte said that he would only accept that position if he was elected in democratic elections, in which all the peoples participated.

Duarte continued to Puerto Plata on July 8, where he was again proclaimed president by the people and the army. The strong support for the liberals was a product of the fact that commercial agriculture had developed more in the Cibao region than in the rest of the country, and therefore the urban sectors in favor of a democratic society were stronger.

===Arrest and second exile===

Meanwhile, Santana was approaching the capital city with an army made up of more than 2,000 soldiers. The French consul threatened the members of the Junta with intervention if they confronted Santana militarily. Some soldiers were pressured and Colonel José Joaquín Puello, Chief of the Plaza, denied support for the Trinitarios. After Santana&#x27;s entry with his troops, he rallied his supporters. Colonel Antonio Abad Alfau harangued the soldiers, who received the soldier under the cry: &quot;Down with the Junta! Long live General Santana!&quot; On July 15, 1844, Santana met with the members of the Governing Board to present their purposes. When Sánchez refused to cooperate, Santana, in revenge, ordered Sánchez&#x27;s arrest. A month later, in a document drafted by Bobadilla and Caminero, the Junta chaired by Santana declared, among other things:
The first deportees by Santana were: Mella, Pina and JJ Illas, a Venezuelan poet, friend of Duarte. Duarte was arrested in the city of Puerto Plata, along with Juan Evangelista Jiménez and other companions. On September 2, 1844 in a ship captained by Juan Bautista Cambiaso. Upon arriving in the capital, the Patrician was locked up in La Torre del Homenaje, (present-day Ozama Fortress). The imprisoned revolutionaries were then sent to exile in Hamburg. He spent nineteen days in the city, where he interacted with members of Freemasonry, an institution which belinged a few years before, as was common among people of certain educational level in the country. His short stay in Germany can be attributed to the fact that he was interested in being as close to his homeland as posible. After a brief stay in Hamburg, on November 30, 1844, Duarte moved to the Caribbean island of Saint Thomas, where he rejected offers to enter the service of Haiti or Spain to oppose Santana. From there, he moved to La Guaira, Venezuela, where his entire family, now plunged into misery, had also been exiled by Santana.

==Life in Venezuela==

In these first years of Duarte&#x27;s arrival in Venezuela, the country is extremely convulsed and is torn between various political interests: on one hand, there were military veterans of the Venezuelan War of Independence who exerted strong pressure to take charge of power after the belief that the mere fact of their participation in the war made them worthy of this, such as José Antonio Páez (first President of the Republic), Carlos Soublette and the brothers José Tadeo Monagas and José Gregorio Monagas. On the other hand, the Liberal Party, newly formed and beginning a strong fight to take over power, were the merchants and intellectuals of the civil sphere who promoted the ideas of the development of the country according to the newly released liberal ideas - especially in the economic sphere, through which they presented themselves as the most suitable sector to govern the destinies of the nation; Prominent among them were the intellectuals Antonio Leocadio Guzmán and Tomás Lander, founders of the party and controversial propagandists of liberal ideas. Finally, the landowners, responsible for agricultural and livestock production as the basis of the economy of the time, also fought to gain power, who became known as Conservatives and also pushed to take charge of power based on the authority generated by their economic power.

In addition, the denominations of Conservative or Liberal did not have any radical difference of thought in Venezuela at the time because, on occasions, the so-called Conservatives adopted measures so liberal that even the Liberal leaders tended to criticize them and confront them publicly, just as the case of the laws of April 10, 1834 and the “Wait and Quit” law – dictated by so-called Conservative governments – which left commercial transactions in the hands of the parties without effective intervention from the State, which is why they went to ruin a considerable number of landowners and merchants from either side. This strong political confrontation was expressed in popular demonstrations and protests in the streets of the main cities and in the fields. In the cities, the constants were arrests, persecutions and confiscations of property and, in the countryside, uprisings, riots and guerrillas, which caused tempers to flare up and keep the country in permanent anxiety, to the point that it could It can be stated, without fear of being wrong, that throughout the 19th century Venezuela experienced a single civil war, with some, very few, moments of calm. Faced with such political instability and in his condition as a foreigner and exile, in other words, by the Dominican government that at times acted as an ally of Venezuela, Duarte decided not to commit himself – much less to his family – and go into the deepest part. from the country. He directs his course towards the town of San Carlos de Río Negro (today a Municipality of the Amazonas state) with the clear intention of going unnoticed. 

=== Retreat to the jungle ===
In February 1845, while in Caracas, he received the news of the execution of María Trinidad Sánchez. Assuming guilt for this death, and rejecting the idea of encouraging a civil war, Duarte disappears from public life, entering the Venezuelan jungle. After writing his book &quot;La Cartera Del Proscripto,&quot; he settled in the city of Angostura, where he lost all contact with friends and family for more than fifteen years. He was apparently suffering from a state of chronic depression. At one point, family members left him for dead. Little is known about his life in the interior of Venezuela, although he established relationships with figures of the radical liberal current of that country. He spent most of his time in a very remote area, El Apure, completely disconnected from what was happening in the world. It is known that he led a poor life, unconcerned with material aspects, interacting with the priest Juan Bautista Sangenis, who taught him sacred history and encouraged him to take priestly habits, which he did not accept, since he believed that he had not yet completed his mission in his homeland.

His friendship with the priest began to change him. His presence in those solitudes impressed the missionary, who was moved by his period of the exile. A deep friendship was born from their conversations. Duarte&#x27;s mysticism was strengthened by contact with the elevated spirit of the priest, well versed in religion and politics. Little by little, Sangenis convinced him to abandon his isolation and move to a less inhospitable place. Around 1852, when Duarte moved to the then Apure, he met with Venezuelan intellectuals, politicians and soldiers dissatisfied with the government had gathered. He traveled through that area of extensive plains with prolonged periods of rain that flooded everything, wreaking havoc with malaria and yellow fever.

=== Achaguas ===
Later, Duarte settled in Achaguas, a city with buildings made of mud and bahareque cane, on the banks of the Apure River, where he remained for some years. There he began a new life, among friends with whom he conversed in Portuguese. In Achaguas he had another faithful friend and protector, Marcelino Muñoz, of great prestige in the region, a defender, like Sangenis, of the demands to transform Venezuelan society, dominated by an elite of landowners. Duarte compromised with him until 1856, when Muñoz suddenly passed. At his funeral, Duarte delivered an elegy reproduced in the pamphlet “Posthumous Honors of Mr. Marcelino Muñoz,” included as an appendix in the booklet “Contributions to a Bibliography on the State of Apure,” written by Argenis Méndez Echenique. 

=== San Fernando de Apure ===
After the death of Muñez, perhaps fleeing the devastation caused by the Federal War, Duarte moved to the capital city of San Fernando de Apure. He visited other towns on the Apureña plains, probably accompanying Sangenis in his ministry, who upon confirming his faith and attachment to religious and philosophical disciplines, invited him to embrace an ecclesiastical career. The answer was communicated by Duarte in a letter to his family: &quot;He wanted me to dedicate myself to the Church, but the affairs of my country, which I hoped to conclude, prevented me from taking that status.&quot; The letter rejoiced the family, who were finally relieved to have heard from their lost relative after so many years.

=== Family and studies ===
Rosa Duarte&#x27;s diary does not record anything between 1846 and 1862. She was surely not interested in returning to the country under the conditions of conservative hegemony, when politics did not correspond to her ideals. Juan Pablo was the only one of the Trinitarios expelled in 1844 who did not return after the amnesty of 1848, and his memory was erased from public consciousness or was surrounded by an image stigmatized by the accusations made against him by Santana and Bobadilla.

Duarte&#x27;s family in Venezuela lived and worked in an affluent area. Duarte&#x27;s cousin Manuel Diez became vice president of the country and helped shelter his kinsman. Duarte&#x27;s family was known to produce candles, this was a major retail and wholesale product since light bulbs for lighting had not been invented yet. While not luxuriously rich an income was available for the Duarte&#x27;s. Duarte, even though he and his family were already by this time residents of the country, still felt ambivalent about openly participating in the country&#x27;s political life, all this despite the fact that the aforementioned cousin Manuel Antonio Díez from the vice presidency, went on to become President of Venezuela in an Ad Tempore capacity.

Duarte travels in Venezuela involved studying the indigenous people and learning from the black and mulatto communities as well as observing as much as he could of the Venezuela of his time. Duarte was an extremely educated man, fluent in many languages, he was a former soldier and teacher. These abilities helped him survive and thrive in those places he travelled. It also marked him as an outsider, given the fact that he was of Caribbean descent, he probably sounded much different than most of the Spanish speakers around him. However, Santo Domingo and the Republic that he had helped father were also highly likely always close to his heart and his mind. He was very much a man divided, excited and deeply moved by the current surroundings, people&#x27;s and events around him, however very much thinking about his beloved land and people whom he sacrificed so much for. A man in a contemplative mood, wounded by the drastic expulsion such as he suffered, would have very little time for a long term wife, children or true stability.

==Restoration of Dominican independence==
===Prelude to annexation===

Within the 17 years of the First Republic, the nation was ravaged with political and economic instability. The Haitians attempted on numerous occasions to regain control over the Dominican part of the island, but were defeated again and again. Political power passed to the conservative group of hateros and former Frenchified boyerista officials, thanks to the control of the presidency of the Central Government Board by Bobadilla and of the Liberation Army by General Santana, who ruled dictatorially in various periods. As time progressed, the constant power struggles between Santana and Buenaventura Báez, who gradually was revealed as more cunning and no less annexationist than the former, set the stage for a period of political and economic chaos.

Between 1853 and 1857, Santana and Báez engaged in a series of political confrontations that eventually reached its breaking point with the outbreak of the Cibaeño Revolution during Báez&#x27;s second term in office. All the while, both would continue to propose that the Dominican Republic be annexed to a foreign power, with Santana choosing Spain, and Báez subjecting the United States. With Báez&#x27;s overthrow in 1858, Santana once again president. But by now, the nation was on the brink of collapse due to the heavy spending of the war, and the bankrupt treasury left behind from Báez administration. All of this, in addition to fears of a renewed Haitian invasion, led to Santana to seek out the proposals from Queen Isabella II of Spain.

Sánchez and Mella, however, did not abandon their liberal positions and patriotic essentials. Their relationships with prominent conservatives was the price to remain in the interior of the country and influence so that things could take the best possible direction. Duarte, however, saw things differently. He believed it was impossible to accept any type of agreement with what he described as &quot;faction.&quot; According to a letter from Juan Isidro Pérez, Duarte was disappointed in Sánchez, whom he had placed in charge following his 1843 exile, due to reaching an agreement with Santana. For Duarte, patriotism of the people was the only possible cause, therefore he refused to conceive the existence of the parties, only recognizing the opposition of traitors. Referring to Báez and his early inclination in favor of the United States, he wrote in 1865:
Duarte preferred complete isolation to any concession. Politics had to be guided by noble purposes or it would be distorted. Consequently, politics implied high ideals, reflection and action for the benefit of the community. Above all things, for Duarte, politics was equivalent to patriotism. His notion of a free country, which was synthesized in the willingness to sacrifice in favor of the principles and the well-being of the people, was the opposite of the common-mind considered as politics: the realm of the struggle for power.

===Assistance from Venezuela===

Although many aspects of his life in Venezuela remain unknown, it is certain that Duarte did not abandon the disposition to action. When sensing danger approaching his country, he did not hesitate to present himself. It was when he learned of the annexation of the Dominican Republic to Spain in March 1861, news that he received more than a year later in the depths of the Venezuelan jungle, and moved to Caracas in August 1862. During the following months, he remained mainly in expectation. It can be deduced that he considered that his prolonged absence from the county is what caused him not to take initiatives. Some even argue that Duarte felt regret for the country, since apparently the majority of the population accepted Santana&#x27;s betrayal. In a brief letter, he wrote:
It was when the Dominican Restoration War broke out, in August 1863, when Duarte started moving. His sister&#x27;s diary was stated that on December 20, 1863, he moved to Caracas with his uncle Mariano Diez. As soon as he found out that the people had begun the fight against Spanish domination, Duarte formed a revolutionary center in Caracas. His brother Vicente Celestino, his uncle Mariano Diez, the young poet Manuel Rodríguez Objío and Candelario Oquendo joined him. Several Venezuelans were interested in supporting the Dominican cause, those who stood out between Blas and Manuel Bruzual the latter known as The Fearless Soldier, exponent of the radical positions of liberalism. President Juan Crisóstomo Falcón received Duarte and promised him help, despite the difficult situation in which Venezuela found itself, after several years of federal war. Despite Falcón&#x27;s good disposition, the help received by Duarte was minimal, since the matter was left in the hands of the vice president, Antonio Guzmán Blanco, (future autocrat of Venezuela), who was not interested in helping the Dominicans. Duarte reflected that In matters of intrigue, Venezuelans were no different from the Dominicans. Apparently he only received a thousand pesos from the Venezuelan government. Many Dominicans came to stand at Duarte&#x27;s orders, but he could not do anything due to lack of funds. Therefore, without having managed to gather resources, as was his wish, together with the four aforementioned companions, he was able to embark in Curaçao in route to his homeland in March 1864. Enduring a long voyage on the &quot;Gold Munster&quot; schooner, they returned to Guaira and passed through the Turks and Caicos Islands, where they had to evade the intense pursuit of a Spanish warship. From there, he arrived in Haiti, in the town of Cap-Haïtien, then from there, he made his way to the Dominican Republic. After 20 years of exile, he was now back in his homeland.

===Second return to Dominican Republic===

He arrived in Monte Cristi on March 25, 1864 and immediately addressed the government of the Restoration. He was joyfully received by General Benito Monción.The next day, they left for Guayubín, where he saw his old friend, Matías Ramón Mella, appointed a few days before as Vice President of the Provisional Government. But unfortunately, Mella was bedridden in a serious state, which destroyed Duarte&#x27;s soul. (Duarte always had special trust in Mella, as well as a close friendship. It was Mella that Duarte sent to Haiti to concretize the political alliance with the reformist Haitians who were fighting against Boyer, and it was Mella, once national independence was achieved, who proclaimed Duarte president of the Republic in Cibao, facts that prove the friendship and trust that existed between them). General José María Cabral, hero of the Battle of Santomé, was present at the emotional meeting.

On March 28, he wrote a letter to the restoration government of Santiago expressing his willingness to consecrate what remains of his strength and life to the service of the Dominican Restoration. A few days later, the acting president, Ulises Francisco Espaillat, responded by saying that the Government “sees with indescribable joy” his return to the heart of the Homeland. In Guayubín he was attacked by malarial fever, so he had to stay bedridden until April 2, 1864. That day, still ill, he left for Santiago, and to make the occasion more unfortunate, they carried the seriously ill General Mella. They arrived in Santiago two days later and the next day he appeared before the restoration authorities, to whom he reiterated the concepts of his letter of the April 28, 1864. His health was going from bad to worse, so for a week he had to remain immobilized in bed. He could not see President General José Antonio Salcedo because he was campaigning in the South. On the 14th he received a letter from the Minister of Finance, Alfredo Deetjen, in which he communicated this: “My government having accepted the services that you have spontaneously offered us has decided to use them, entrusting the Republic of Venezuela with a mission whose purpose You will be informed in due course. In this virtue, my government hopes that you will be willing to get ready to embark on a trip while the credentials and instructions for the case are prepared.”

===Final exile===

The restoration government did not evaluate the importance that it had the presence of Duarte, which could have been due to the fact that his figure had has been buried by oblivion and that some of the leaders of the national contest had been supporters of Santana. That letter dismayed Duarte. Sad and disappointed, he was shaken by his most varied thoughts, to the point that he came to think that his presence was not pleasant to certain circles of the government. This mission, neither desired nor requested by him, contradicted the effort made to return to the homeland and his desire to remain in the country fighting for the Restoration.

In April 1864, the government of Santiago, through Espaillat, Duarte was asked to move to Venezuela at the head of a diplomatic mission in order to get help. He was not willing to accept the assignment, because his interest was to participate in the struggle in the interior of the country. But, a few days later, an article published in the Diario de la Marina, in Havana, was received, signed by G. (who could have been the writer Manuel de Jesús Galván, the main Dominican spokesperson of the Spanish regime in Santo Domingo), which predicted internal struggles among the restaurateurs for control due to the return of Duarte. So that it could not be thought that he was motivated by personal ambitions, Duarte informed Espaillat that he accepted the appointment, although for a few days he hoped to remain in the interior of the country. Espaillat, however, confirmed Duarte&#x27;s appointment, although he told him that he should not stay with the impression that G.&#x27;s intrigue had had an effect. At the beginning of June, invested as Minister Plenipotentiary, he left for Haiti, and at the end of the month, on the 28th, he arrived in Saint Thomas. He then continued to Curaçao, where he remained almost two months making enormous diplomatic efforts. In August, he returned to Caracas. His eyes never again saw his Dominican Republic, the land that he always loved and for which he resignedly accepted the greatest sacrifices. After nearly two years of war, Spain annulled the annexation and called off its remaining troops. As a result, independence was restored, and by July 1865, the Spanish forces were off the island.

==Final years==
===Post-Restoration War===
Duarte closely followed the evolution of the country, as shown in the active correspondence he had during those months, although he resigned from diplomatic representation following the overthrow of President Gaspar Polanco, who had released his credentials. He was above all concerned about the recomposition of annexationism, this time in favor of the United States, which was promoted mainly by Buenaventura Báez. That is why he pointed out in a letter to Félix María Delmonte:
From the end of 1865, Dominican politics moved away of the patriotic objectives stated in the Restoration. Most of the leaders who emerged from that war oriented toward anarchic and conservative positions. Duarte must have assessed the poverty of the political leadership, as he refers in another letter to Delmonte on May 2, 1865:
He was said to have experienced new disappointment when he saw that the old annexationist, Buenaventura Báez, the architect of the Levasseur Plan of 1843, was elevated to the presidency, brought by none other than the then president, José María Cabral, champion of the Restoration in the south. From then on, although he did not leave Caracas, he disassociated himself from Dominican politics. The country entered a whirlwind of passions between leaders and a difficult situation in which annexation to the United States was approved in 1870. Practically, everyone forgot about Duarte; Occasionally he received visits or correspondence from liberal intellectuals interested in the reconstruction of the events that led to the birth of the Republic. Gregorio Luperón, the hero of the Restoration War, made efforts to return Duarte back to the country. In addition, Duarte received a letter from President Ignacio María González, who invited him to reintegrate into the Dominican Republic. But by now, Duarte was in extreme poverty and his health was fading rapidly. Therefore, he could not respond to these calls for his return.

===Death===
On July 14, 1876, Duarte&#x27;s health was seriously deteriorating. Suffering from tuberculosis and pneumonia, his breathing had worsened, causing him to be confined to his bed. In his final moment, residing in his home, located on the corners of Zamuro and Pájaro, he was accompanied by sisters Rosa and Francisco, and his brother, Manuel. The next day, at 3 in the morning, he passed away. A text narrates that gloomy day in these terms:

The first news of his death was announced through the Diario de Avisos, of Caracas, in the afternoon edition of July 15, 1876. The note states the following:
Very few attended Duarte&#x27;s funeral with the exceptions of family members, friends, and some immediate neighbors. Among the attendees were: Manuel Duarte, Enrique Duarte, José Ayala, Francisco Tejera, Federico Tejera, AS de Vizcarrondo, Marcos Guzmán, Felipe Tejera, Miguel Tejera and Andrés Tejera.

==Personal life==

Duarte&#x27;s personal life to date is the subject of discussion. It is known that he was a poet who followed Romanticism. He also used to play the guitar, the piano and the flute; he also practiced fencing. Duarte was also a polyglot who spoke six languages: Spanish, Latin, Portuguese, French, English and German.

During his youth, Duarte had several love affairs. His first relationship was with María Antonia Bobadilla, which she ended years later for unknown reasons. The Duarte Museum is said to have preserved the ring in which he gave to her as a sign of commitment. Years later, Duarte fell in love with Prudencia &quot;Nona&quot; Lluberes, a Catalan descendant with whom he formalized a relationship that was interrupted due to his exile and his subsequent suffering from tuberculosis. The dates on which Duarte maintained these relationships are not known, given the imprecision about his private life and the last years of his life in exile. Some historians also certify that he had a son during his stay in Venezuela with a woman named Marcela Mercedes.

Jose Joaquin Perez Saviñon, director of the Duartiano Institute, commented on Duarte&#x27;s first love story: &quot;For unknown reasons, the engagement was broken.&quot; But Duarte would have the opportunity to fall in love again, this time with a descendant of Catalans and a relative of various patriots, Prudencia Lluberes, La Nona. Troncoso Sánchez says in &quot;Apuntes Duartianos&quot; that &quot;his second girlfriend received, like his first, his promise of marriage symbolized in a ring.&quot;

Always persecuted by his ideals, Duarte loved, but could not continue with Prudencia &quot;Nona&quot; Lluberes. Pérez Saviñón comments that Yovanny Ferrúa wrote an article highlighting that already in exile, Duarte wanted to marry her by her power, but they did not let him because he already suffered from tuberculosis. &quot;They even tore up the letters he sent her for fear of contagion from her, which is why Duarte&#x27;s love letters are not preserved,&quot; says the president of the Duartiano Institute.

Pérez Saviñón assures that Prudencia always hoped and dreamed of the Father of the country. She never married. Saviñón ecxplained:
While the country maintains the version that Duarte never married, much less that he had children, Bulletin 117 of the General Archive of the Nation, called &quot;The Duarte family: Genealogy at the service of history,&quot; Antonio José Guerra Sánchez refers to the Theories of the descendants of Juan Pablo Duarte Díez.

Guerra Sánchez says:

However, he adds that it is unknown that there was a Vicenta Díez and even less is known of which of the brothers of the mother of the hero was her daughter.
What is certain is that Duarte did not marry, and according to Pérez Saviñón he did not “because he clearly said that he had married the country, all his efforts were for the country. The love for the homeland was superior to everything, even though he was already a defeated old man, he still thought about the homeland. He sacrificed himself for his spirit of service,&quot; he says.

==Writings==

Aside from his stature as a revolutionary leader, he was also known as a writer. Duarte did not pretend to be a poet, as Don Vetilio says, although he liked poetry as demonstrated by his published verses, including some saved poems, which he wrote when he was almost lost in the Venezuelan jungle. His poetry, as Ángela Peña points out, is “an extension of his patriotic and political work, even though there are poems of his in which he sings to women. It cannot be considered that the Father of the Nation was a poet. Literary creation was not a habit in his life. He wrote responding to the imperatives of the moment without having poetry as a constant and permanent way of expression.&quot; Among the known poems, written by Juan Pablo Duarte in Santo Domingo, are Tristezas de la noche, Santana, Canto de guerra, Antifona, El Criollo, Desconsuelo, Suplica, Himno, La Cartera del proscribado, and four other poems without titles. In his romantic production, is the poem &quot;Romance&quot;, the theme of bitterness is evident. Remoteness portrays the stormy pain of feeling expatriated from her land along with her eight companions in misfortune, those who gave everything to see her free and sovereign:
However, of the writings in his eventful years of exile, there are only a few verses without titles, contributed by the Venezuelan historian Francisco Manuel de las Heras y Borrero in his essay Juan Pablo Duarte in Venezuela, written while he lived in Chaguas: “Here the Patricio will participate in literary and social gatherings, avoiding overtly political ones, given his refugee status. (…). Duarte&#x27;s presence in this geographical location is clearly identified in 1856, the year in which the first book published in Apure was published. These are the Posthumous Honors of Mr. Marcelino Muñoz (…). In the reviewed publication, a poem by Juan Pablo Duarte appears, dedicated to extolling the merits of the deceased, his friend, &quot;who was the president of the Masonic Sociedad Joven Achaguas, which Juan Pablo Duarte frequentedHere are the verses contributed by de las Heras and Borreros:
==Legacy and honors==
===Symbol of Dominican independence===

Duarte was, in his time, the most consistent exponent of nationalist and independence ideas derived from the liberal principles of the American Revolution and French Revolution of 1776 and 1789, respectively. He was also the main promoter of national consciousness and permanent defender of the Dominican national identity. He advocated the union of all Dominicans, as well as the establishment of a democratic republic based on the rule of the Constitution and the laws in order to fully guarantee the public rights and freedoms of citizens.

Duarte was never in favor of violating democratic procedures to access political power and direct national destinies. He believed in national unity as an indispensable principle to prevent civil discord and the desires of foreign powers from causing his independence project to succumb. He is remembered with respect as &quot;Father of the Dominican Republic &quot; with preservation of his admirable patriotic legacy, because thanks to his fruitful revolutionary work that today Dominicans constitute an ethnic and cultural community (which evolved throughout the centuries) proud to have as their own. He was always willing to defend national sovereignty against the claims of those who &quot;without judgment and without heart they conspire against the health of the country.”

Duarte managed to establish a free Republic, which through the voting process, could give rise to a democracy where all citizens, in theory, could be equal and free. The study trips he made to Europe in his adolescence, a continent where liberal ideas resulting from the French Revolution were debated and imposed, greatly influenced his later attitudes in the independence struggles. His political thought and his magnificent feat in the independence struggle, undoubtedly, places him in the position of Simón Bolívar, José de San Martín, José Gervasio Artigas, Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, Antonio Maceo and José Martí.
He is considered a national hero and father of democracy in the Dominican Republic. He is also credited with being the precursor of Dominican theater by being the first to promote theatrical events through the La Filantrópica and La Dramática societies, which aimed to present theatrical works alluding to Dominican freedom. Duarte ran serious dangers and misfortunes due to his profound knowledge acquired in Europe and his decision to create a Republic that would serve as a base for Dominicans to get rid of Haitian repression and the betrayals of conservatives who had accommodated their interests to Spain, France, Great Britain, and the United States, regardless of the persecution that Duarte and his followers fell victim to. In this vein, Dominican historian Vetilio Alfau Durán writes:
One of his most emblematic phrases was without a doubt &quot;Living without a country is the same as living without honor!&quot; This quote left a great mark on the Dominican people. In addition, his dream of a nation free of all foreign power is evident through another famous phrase: &quot;Our homeland must be free and independent from any foreign power or the island sinks.&quot;

===Admiration by other historical figures===

Duarte&#x27;s revolutionary work has earned him praised from other leaders throughout North America. He gained acknowledgement from other Caribbean independence leaders, especially Eugenio Maria de Hostos of Puerto Rico, and José Martí of Cuba. Both leaders spoke admirably of Dominican Republic&#x27;s struggle for freedom, with the former even referring to Duarte as the master of patriotism. The distinguished Dominican intellectual Federico Henríquez y Carvajal, a close friend and collaborator of Hostos, in his speech read, in his capacity as President of the Erector Board, at the inauguration of the monument to Juan Pablo Duarte on July 16, 1930, cites the following words of the Puerto Rican humanist referring to the patrician:
Hostos left evidence in his intellectual work of the admiration and respect that the historical figure of the patrician inspired in him. In the book &quot;Visión de Hostos sobre Duarte&quot;, published in 2013 under the auspices of the General Archive of the Nation, we bring together several texts by the immortal author of &quot;Moral Social&quot; referring to the three fathers of the Dominican homeland, but with emphasis on Duarte. In &quot;The municipality of Santo Domingo&quot; - or &quot;The repatriation of Duarte&#x27;s ashes&quot;, as this short article can be titled - Hostos discusses the interest of the First City in bringing the remains of Duarte to the Dominican Republic: &quot;For a long time now, Luperón and other patriots had asked public opinion for the repatriation of Duarte&#x27;s ashes. They preached in the desert,” says Hostos.

It remains pending, for a later and more exhaustive investigation, to rescue a dramatic text that Hostos wrote in Chile alluding to the Duarte&#x27;s return to his homeland in March 1864, according to the information that the historian Emilio Rodríguez Demorizi records: &quot;There [in Chile] he wrote the children&#x27;s comedy &quot;Duarte&#x27;s Arrival&quot;, not to Chile naturally, but to the distant homeland. His children play, warlike, Dominicans and Haitians, and he is excited like a child when the eldest of them, victorious, shows him with his index finger, on the highest branch of an olive tree, the Duarte flag.&quot;

Hostos refers to this children&#x27;s play in a letter addressed to the editor of the newspaper &quot;El Telefono&quot; , from Santiago de Chile, on 23 September 1890, the year in which we assume he wrote the aforementioned comedy. He regrets not having been able, due to health problems that afflicted him, to perform &quot;The Arrival of Duarte,&quot; a children&#x27;s comedy animated by affectionate memories and acclamations from little Dominicans that would not have failed to resonate among the spectators. In that letter there is a lot of love shown towards Duarte&#x27;s homeland: &quot;I have spent the [Chilean] national holidays unwell. Consequently, I have not been able to take the part in them that I wanted, and that would have made our Quisqueya and its flag take.&quot;

Martí, who knew the life and work of Duarte, wrote about him on several occasions. In this regard, Emilio Rodríguez Demorizi published an essential text to know Martí&#x27;s relationship with the Dominican Republic: &quot;Martí in Santo Domingo.&quot; The book collects everything that Martí, nicknamed the &quot;Cuban Apostle,&quot; wrote on Dominican topics, including those referring to Duarte. For the month of April 1894, funds were collected in Santo Domingo to erect the statue of the founder of the Republic, Juan Pablo Duarte. Generalissimo Máximo Gómez was in New York, where he was preparing to set off for Cuba to fight in the Cuban War of Independence, and decided to take a “parenthesis in revolutionary work to write to the director of &quot;Patria&quot;, by José Martí.” (&quot;Patria&quot; was the Cuban revolutionary newspaper). In Gómez&#x27;s letter he requests the contribution of Cubans to &quot;increase the funds (to) erect a statue of Juan Pablo Duarte worthy of his memory.&quot;

Martí&#x27;s response as director of &quot;Patria&quot;, called, &quot;Adhesion of Patria&quot; and General Gómez&#x27;s letter were published on April 17. In it Martí shows great mastery of the Dominican historical process and, especially, of the figure of the founder of the Republic. There he speaks:

<doc id="1291705" wikidata="Q549005" url="?curid=1291705" title="Nelson A. Miles">
<text>Nelson Appleton Miles (August 8, 1839 – May 15, 1925) was a United States Army officer who served in the American Civil War (1861–1865), the later American Indian Wars (1840–1890), and the Spanish–American War,
(1898). From 1895 to 1903, Miles served as the last Commanding General of the United States Army, before the office was transformed into the current Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in 1903.

==Early life==
Nelson A. Miles was born on his family&#x27;s farm in Westminster, Massachusetts on August 8, 1839, the son of Daniel Miles and Mary (Curtis) Miles. He was raised and educated in Westminster, and attended the academy run by educator John R. Galt. Having decided on a business career, as a teenager, he moved to Boston, where he worked as a clerk in the John Collamore &amp; Company crockery store.

While living in Boston, he also attended Comer&#x27;s Commercial College, a business school that offered night courses. With the outbreak of the American Civil War likely, Miles was among several young men in Boston who began to study drill and ceremony, tactics, and strategy under the tutelage of Eugene Salignac, who used the title &quot;colonel&quot; and claimed to be a French army veteran.

==Civil War==
The war started in April 1861; on September 9, 1861, Miles enlisted in the Union Army and was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, which was organized and commanded by Henry Wilson. He was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of the 61st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment on May 31, 1862. He was promoted to the rank of colonel after the Battle of Antietam of September 1862.

Other battles he participated in include Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville (during which he was shot in the neck and abdomen), the Overland Campaign, and the final Appomattox Campaign, and Wounded four times in battle. Following the war, two years later, on March 2, 1867, Miles was brevetted a brigadier general in the regular army in recognition of his earlier wartime actions of 1863 at Chancellorsville. He was again brevetted, this time to the rank of major general, for his documented actions at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House in 1864. Three decades later, he received the Medal of Honor on July 23, 1892, for his gallantry at Chancellorsville. He was appointed brigadier general of volunteers as of May 12, 1864, for the Battles of the Wilderness and Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. Six months after the end of the Civil War, on October 21, 1865, he was appointed a major general of volunteers at the young age of 26. After the war, he was commandant of Fort Monroe, Virginia at the mouth of the Hampton Roads harbor and the southern end of Chesapeake Bay and the James River, where former Confederate President, Jefferson Davis (1808–1889), was held prisoner. During his tenure at Fortress Monroe, General Miles was forced to defend himself against charges that Davis was being mistreated.

==Indian Wars==
In July 1866, Miles was appointed a colonel in the Regular Army, confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The next year, in April 1867, he was appointed assistant commissioner of the North Carolina branch of the United States War Department&#x27;s Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, (Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau), serving under Bureau Commissioner, Brigadier General Oliver O. Howard (1830–1909). On June 30, 1868, he married Mary Hoyt Sherman (daughter of Charles Taylor Sherman, niece of fellow Union Army General William T. Sherman and U.S. Senator John Sherman, and granddaughter of Charles R. Sherman). In March 1869, he became commander of the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment, a position he held for 11 years.

Miles played a leading role in nearly all of the U.S. Army&#x27;s campaigns of the 
later American Indian Wars against the native American Indian tribes of the Great Plains, of the Mid-West, among whom he was known as &quot;Bearcoat&quot; (for his characteristic bearskin fur coat). In 1874–1875, he was a field commander in the force that defeated the Kiowa, Comanche, and the Southern Cheyenne along the upper Red River of the South. Between 1876 and 1877, he participated in the campaign that scoured the Northern Plains after 5 companies of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment under the command of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer were massacred at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in June 1876, and forced the Lakota Sioux tribe under chiefs Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and their native allies onto designated federal Indian reservations. In the winter of 1877, he drove his bluecoat mounted troops on a forced march across the eastern Montana Territory to intercept and stop the Nez Perce tribal band led by Chief Joseph (1840–1904), after the Nez Perce War, heading north to cross the border into British Canada. For the rest of his career, General Miles would quarrel with General Oliver O. Howard (1830–1909), who also led the pursuing expedition over taking credit for Chief Joseph&#x27;s capture. Later while on the Yellowstone River, he developed expertise with the use of the heliograph for sending long-distance communications signals utilizing ancient principles of sunlight and mirrors, establishing a line of stations with heliographs connecting far-flung military posts of Fort Keogh and Fort Custer, in the Montana Territory in 1878. The heliographs were supplied by Brig. Gen. Albert J. Myer (1828–1880), of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Signal Corps.

In December 1880, Miles was promoted to brigadier general in the Regular Army. He was then assigned to command the military Department of the Columbia (1881–1885) in Oregon and the Washington Territory, and subsequently the Department of Missouri (1885–1886). In 1886, Miles replaced General George R. Crook (1828–1890), as commander of forces fighting against Geronimo (1829–1909), a Chiricahua Apache renegade chief / guerrilla-fighter leader, in the military&#x27;s Department of Arizona in the old Arizona Territory in the Southwest. General Crook had relied heavily on Apache scouts in his efforts to capture Geronimo. Instead, Miles relied instead on white regular cavalry troops, who eventually traveled without success as they tracked Geronimo through the tortuous Sierra Madre Mountains of neighboring northern Mexico. Finally, young First Lieutenant Charles B. Gatewood (1853–1896), who had studied Apache culture and ways, succeeded in meeting with and negotiating a surrender of the war chief at a subsequent meeting arranged and held with General Miles, under the terms of which Geronimo and his few remaining followers agreed to temporarily spend two years in exile on a Florida reservation far to the east. Geronimo agreed on these terms, being unaware of the real plot behind the negotiations (that there was no real intent to let them go back to their native lands in Arizona and New Mexico). The exile included even the Chiricahuas Apache scouts who had worked for the army, in violation of Miles&#x27; original agreement with them. Miles denied Lt. Gatewood any credit for the negotiations and had him transferred far north to the Dakota Territory. During this campaign, Miles&#x27; special signals unit used the heliograph extensively, proving its worth in the field. The special signals unit was under the command of Captain W. A. Glassford. In 1888, Miles became the commander of the Army&#x27;s Military Division of the Pacific and the Department of California, headquartered at The Presidio in San Francisco.

Two years later in April 1890, Miles was promoted to major general in the Regular Army and became the commander of the Military Division of the Missouri. The Ghost Dance movement of the Lakota Sioux people, which started in 1889, led to the Pine Ridge Campaign of the so-called Ghost Dance War and General Miles being brought back into the field. During the campaign, he commanded U.S. Army troops stationed near the several federal Indian reservations in the new state of South Dakota and hoped that Lakota chief Sitting Bull could be peacefully removed from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. However, on December 15, 1890, Chief Sitting Bull was killed by Indian agency police attempting to arrest him, and 14 days later on December 29th, American cavalry troops surrounded and massacred hundreds of Lakota Sioux at Wounded Knee. Miles was not directly involved in the tragic massacre, and was critical of the Army&#x27;s commanding officer of the reconstituted / reorganized and ill-fated 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment in the field, Colonel James W. Forsyth (1833–1906). Just two days after the massacre, Miles wrote to his wife, describing it as &quot;the most abominable criminal military blunder and a horrible massacre of women and children&quot;. After his retirement from the Army a decade later, he fought for compensation payments to the Lakota Sioux survivors of the massacre. Overall, however, he believed that the United States federal government should have authority over the native Indians, with the Lakota under military control.

==Spanish–American War and later life==
In his capacity as commander of the Department of the East from 1894 to 1895, Miles commanded the troops mobilized to put down the Pullman strike riots. He was named Commanding General of the United States Army in 1895, a post he held during the Spanish–American War. Miles commanded forces at Cuban sites such as Siboney.

After the surrender of Santiago de Cuba by the Spaniards, he led the invasion of Puerto Rico, landing in Guánica in what is known as the Puerto Rican Campaign. He served as the first head of the military government established on the island, acting as both heads of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs. Upon returning to the United States, Miles was a vocal critic of the Army&#x27;s quartermaster general, Brigadier General Charles P. Eagan, for providing rancid canned meat to troops in the field during what was known as the Army beef scandal. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general in 1900 based on his performance in the war. Miles was an opponent of the Philippine–American War and supported an inquiry into the brutality of American troops in the Philippines. In response, President Roosevelt called Miles a hypocrite and reminded him of his complicity in the Wounded Knee massacre. Miles would release his own report on US atrocities in the Philippines to the public. He condemned the use of concentration camps and said that the use of torture was widespread and was undertaken with the knowledge of some senior officers.

To show that he was still physically able to command, on July 14, 1903, less than a month before his 64th birthday, General Miles rode the 90 miles from Fort Sill to Fort Reno, Oklahoma, in eight hours&#x27; riding time (10 hrs 20 mins total), in temperatures between . The distance was covered on a relay of horses stationed at 10-mile intervals; the first 30 miles were covered in 2 hours, 25 minutes. This was the longest horseback ride ever made by a commanding general of the army.

Called a &quot;brave peacock&quot; by President Theodore Roosevelt, Miles nevertheless retired from the army in 1903 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64. Upon his retirement, the office of Commanding General of the United States Army was abolished by an Act of Congress and the Army Chief of Staff system was introduced. A year later, standing as a presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention, he received a handful of votes. The Prohibition Party was going to give him their nomination, but an hour before balloting he sent a telegram to the convention stating that he did not want the nomination which went to Silas C. Swallow instead. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the 77-year-old general offered to serve, but President Woodrow Wilson turned him down.

Miles died in 1925 at the age of 85 from a heart attack while attending the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in Washington, D.C., with his grandchildren. First Lady Grace Coolidge was also in attendance at the circus that day, and upon arriving at the showgrounds the general told circus owner John Ringling that he never missed a circus. Nelson was one of the last surviving general officers who served during the Civil War on either side. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in the Miles Mausoleum. It is one of only two mausoleums within the confines of the cemetery. George Burroughs Torrey painted his portrait.

Miles&#x27; legacy as an Indian fighter has seen him portrayed by Kevin Tighe in the film &quot;&quot;, by Hugh O&#x27;Brian in the film &quot;&quot;, and by Shaun Johnston in the film adaptation of &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;. There is a bust of General Miles in the Massachusetts State Capitol in Boston. General Miles&#x27; son, Sherman Miles (1882–1966), was a career Army officer who graduated from West Point in 1905 and rose to the rank of major general during World War II. His daughter Cecelia was the wife of Colonel Samuel Reber II, and the mother of Miles and Samuel Reber III.

<doc id="1291713" wikidata="Q241256" url="?curid=1291713" title="African civet">
<text>The African civet (Civettictis civetta) is a large viverrid native to sub-Saharan Africa, where it is considered common and widely distributed in woodlands and secondary forests. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008. In some countries, it is threatened by hunting, and wild-caught individuals are kept for producing civetone for the perfume industry.

The African civet is primarily nocturnal and spends the day sleeping in dense vegetation, but wakes up at sunset. It is a mammal with a unique coloration: the black and white blotches covering its coarse pelage and rings on the tail are an effective cryptic pattern. The black bands surrounding its eyes closely resemble those of the raccoon. Other distinguishing features are its disproportionately large hindquarters and its erectile dorsal crest. It is an omnivorous generalist, preying on small vertebrates, invertebrates, eggs, carrion, and vegetable matter. It is one of the few carnivores capable of eating toxic invertebrates such as termites and millipedes. It detects prey primarily by smell and sound rather than by sight. It is the only living member of the genus Civettictis.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
&quot;Viverra civetta&quot; was the scientific name introduced in 1776 by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber when he described African civets based on previous descriptions and accounts. Schreber is therefore considered the binomial authority.
In 1915, Reginald Innes Pocock described the structural differences between feet of African and large Indian civet (&quot;Viverra zibetha&quot;) specimens in the zoological collection of the Natural History Museum, London. Because of marked differences, he proposed &quot;Civettictis&quot; as a new genus, with &quot;C. civetta&quot; as only species.
The following subspecies were proposed in the 20th century:
*&quot;C. c. congica&quot; described by Ángel Cabrera in 1929 was a zoological specimen from the upper Congo River.
*&quot;C. c. schwarzi&quot; was proposed by Cabrera in 1929 for African civet specimens from East Africa.
*&quot;C. c. australis&quot; described by in 1955 was based on a male type specimen and three paratype specimens collected near the Olifants River in northeastern Transvaal province.
*&quot;C. c. volkmanni&quot; also described by Lundholm in 1955 was a specimen from the vicinity of Otavi in Namibia.
*&quot;C. c. pauli&quot; described in 2000 by , Künzel and Rayaleh was a specimen collected close to the coast near Djibouti.

A 1969 study noted that this civet showed enough differences from the rest of the viverrines in terms of dentition to be classified under its own genus.

===Evolution===
A 2006 phylogenetic study showed that the African civet is closely related to the genus &quot;Viverra&quot;. It was estimated that the &quot;Civettictis&quot;-&quot;Viverra&quot; clade diverged from &quot;Viverricula&quot; around 16.2 Mya; the African civet split from &quot;Viverra&quot; 12.3 Mya. The authors suggested that the subfamily Viverrinae should be bifurcated into Genettinae (&quot;Poiana&quot; and &quot;Genetta&quot;) and Viverrinae (&quot;Civettictis&quot;, &quot;Viverra,&quot; and &quot;Viverricula&quot;). The following cladogram is based on this study.

== Etymology ==
The generic name &quot;Civettictis&quot; is a fusion of the French word &quot;civette&quot; and the Greek word &quot;ictis&quot;, meaning &quot;weasel&quot;. The specific name &quot;civetta&quot; and the common name &quot;civet&quot; come from the French &quot;civette&quot; or the Arabic &quot;zabād&quot; or &quot;sinnawr al-zabād&quot; (&quot;civet cat&quot;).

===Local and indigenous names===
*In Tigrinya: (&quot;zibad&quot;) 
*In Akan: 
*In Yoruba: , 
*In Igbo: 

==Characteristics==
The African civet has a coarse and wiry fur that varies in colour from white to creamy yellow to reddish on the back. The stripes, spots, and blotches are deep brown to black. Horizontal lines are prominent on the hind limbs, spots are normally present on its midsection and fade into vertical stripes above the forelimbs. Its muzzle is pointed, ears small and rounded. A black band stretches across its small eyes, and two black bands are around its short broad neck. Following the spine of the animal extending from the neck to the base of the tail is the erectile dorsal crest. The hairs of the erectile crest are longer than those of the rest of the pelage.

The sagittal crest of its skull is well-developed providing a large area for attachment of the temporal muscle. The zygomatic arch is robust and provides a large area for attachment of the masseter muscle. This musculature and its strong mandible give it a powerful bite. Its dental formula is . Its black paws are compact with hairless soles, five digits per manus in which the first toe is slightly set back from the others. Its long, curved claws are semi-retractile. Its head-and-body length is , with a long tail. The average weight is within a range of .
It is the largest viverrid in Africa. Only the binturong is likely heavier among the world&#x27;s viverrids. Its shoulder height averages . Both male and female have perineal and anal glands, which are bigger in males. The perineal glands are located between the scrotum and the penis in males, and between the anus and the vulva in females.

== Distribution and habitat ==

African civets typically sleep during the day in the tall grasses near water sources in central and southern Africa. It often inhabits savannahs, forests, and sometimes near rivers as the tall grasses and thickets present provide them with necessary cover during the day. In Guinea&#x27;s National Park of Upper Niger, it was recorded during surveys conducted in 1996 to 1997.
In Gabon&#x27;s Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, it was photographed close to forested areas during a survey in 2012.
In Batéké Plateau National Park, it was recorded in gallery forest along the Mpassa River during surveys conducted between June 2014 and May 2015.

In the Republic of Congo, it was recorded in the Western Congolian forest–savanna mosaic of Odzala-Kokoua National Park during surveys in 2007.

In the transboundary Dinder–Alatash (Sudan and Ethiopia) protected area complex it was recorded during surveys between 2015 and 2018. It is also frequently spotted in Ethiopia&#x27;s northern Degua Tembien massif.

==Behaviour and ecology==
African civets deposit their feces in large piles called latrines, or specifically &quot;civetries&quot;. The latrines are characterized by fruits, seeds, exoskeletons of insect and millipede rings, and occasionally clumps of grass. The role of civet latrines as a mechanism of seed dispersal and forest regeneration is still being researched. Like felids, male African civets scent mark by spraying urine backwards.

African civets are typically solitary creatures. They use their perineal gland secretion to mark their territories around their civetries. These markings typically follow common routes and paths and lie within 100 meters of civetries 96.72% of the time.

If an African civet feels threatened, it raises its dorsal crest to make itself look larger and thus more formidable and dangerous to attack. This behavior is a predatory defense.

=== Feeding ===
Research in southeastern Nigeria revealed that the African civet has an omnivorous diet. It feeds on rodents like giant pouched rats (&quot;Cricetomys&quot;), Temminck&#x27;s mouse (&quot;Mus musculoides&quot;), Tullberg&#x27;s soft-furred mouse (&quot;Praomys tulbergi&quot;), greater cane rat (&quot;Thryonomys swinderianus&quot;), and typical striped grass mouse (&quot;Lemniscomys striatus&quot;), amphibians and small reptiles like Hallowell&#x27;s toad (&quot;Amietophrynus maculatus&quot;), herald snake (&quot;Crotaphopeltis hotamboeia&quot;), black-necked spitting cobra (&quot;Naja nigricollis&quot;), common agama (&quot;Agama agama&quot;), and &quot;Mabuya&quot; skinks, birds, millipedes, and insects such as Orthoptera, Coleoptera, and Blattodea, as well as carrion, eggs, fruits (such as &quot;Strychnos&quot;), berries and seeds.
African civets can take prey as large as hares but can be somewhat clumsy killers with sizable prey. Stomach content of three African civets in Botswana included foremost husks of fan palm (&quot;Hyphaene petersiana&quot;) and jackalberry (&quot;Diospyros mespiliformis&quot;), and some remains of African red toad (&quot;Schismaderma carens&quot;), Acrididae grasshoppers and larvae of Dytiscidae beetles.

Green grass is also frequently found in feces, and this seems to be linked to the eating of snakes and amphibians.

===Reproduction===
Captive females are polyestrous. Mating lasts 40 to 70 seconds.
In Southern Africa, African civets probably mate from October to November, and females give birth in the rainy season between January and February.

The average lifespan of a captive African civet is 15 to 20 years. Females create a nest which is normally in dense vegetation and commonly in a hole dug by another animal. Female African civets normally give birth to one to four young. The young are born in advanced stages compared to most carnivores. They are covered in a dark, short fur and can crawl at birth. The young leave the nest after 18 days but are still dependent on the mother for milk and protection for another two months.

==Threats==
In 2006, it was estimated that about 9,400 African civets are hunted yearly in the Nigerian part and more than 5,800 in the Cameroon part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests.
Skins and skulls of African civets were found in 2007 at the Dantokpa Market in southern Benin, where it was among the most expensive small carnivores. Local hunters considered it a rare species, indicating that the population declined due to hunting for trade as bushmeat.

The African civet has historically been hunted for the secretion of perineal glands. This secretion is a white or yellow waxy substance called civetone, which has been used as a basic ingredient for many perfumes for hundreds of years. In Ethiopia, African civets are hunted alive, and are kept in small cages. Most die within three weeks after capture, most likely due to stress. Extraction of the civetone is cruel and has been criticised by animal rights activists. The writer Daniel Defoe once invested in a scheme to raise civets in captivity for their secretions.

The population of African civet in Botswana is listed under Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

<text>Hlučín Region (, , ) is a historically significant part of Czech Silesia, now part of the Moravian-Silesian Region in the Czech Republic. It is named after its largest town, Hlučín. Its area is , and in 2021, it had 66,750 inhabitants.

==Municipalities==
In terms of the current municipal division, the region consists of the following 27 municipalities. Towns are shown in bold.

Bělá &quot;(Bielau)&quot; – Bohuslavice &quot;(Buslawitz)&quot; – Bolatice &quot;(Bolatitz)&quot; – Chlebičov &quot;(Klebsch)&quot; – Chuchelná &quot;(Kuchelna)&quot; – Darkovice &quot;(Groß Darkowitz)&quot; – Dolní Benešov &quot;(Beneschau)&quot; – Hať &quot;(Haatsch)&quot; – Hlučín &quot;(Hultschin)&quot; – Hněvošice &quot;(Schreibersdorf)&quot; – Kobeřice &quot;(Köberwitz)&quot; – Kozmice &quot;(Kosmütz)&quot; – Kravaře &quot;(Deutsch Krawarn)&quot; – Ludgeřovice &quot;(Ludgierzowitz)&quot; – Markvartovice &quot;(Markersdorf)&quot; – Oldřišov &quot;(Odersch)&quot; – Píšť &quot;(Pyschcz / Sandau)&quot; – Rohov &quot;(Rohow)&quot; – Šilheřovice &quot;(Schillersdorf)&quot; – Služovice &quot;(Schlausewitz)&quot; – Štěpánkovice &quot;(Schepankowitz)&quot; – Strahovice &quot;(Strandorf)&quot; – Sudice &quot;(Zauditz)&quot; – Třebom &quot;(Thröm)&quot; – Velké Hoštice &quot;(Groß Hoschütz)&quot; – Vřesina &quot;(Wreschin)&quot; – Závada &quot;(Zawada bei Beneschau)&quot;

These municipalities cooperate in microregion &quot;Sdružení obcí Hlučínska&quot; since 1992.

Also, the former municipalities of Malé Hoštice &quot;(Klein Hoschütz)&quot;, now district of Opava, and Hošťálkovice &quot;(Hoschialkowitz)&quot;, Lhotka &quot;(Ellguth)&quot;, Petřkovice &quot;(Petershofen)&quot;, Koblov &quot;(Koblau)&quot; and Antošovice &quot;(Antoschowitz)&quot;, now districts or parts of Ostrava, once belonged to the region.

==Geography==
Hlučín Region lies in the Opava Hilly Land within the Silesian Lowlands. The Opava River flows through the region. Hlučín Region contains several water bodies, the largest of which are the artificial lakes Hlučínské and Jezero, and the Nezmar fish pond.

==History==
Archaeological finds suggest that the area was inhabited since 4500 to 2500 BC.

The mediaeval bishoprics of both Olomouc and Wrocław attempted to control it. In the end, Olomouc won the dispute, and the area became part of the March of Moravia. In 1269, Hlučín belonged to the lands that were split off Moravia by King Ottokar II of Bohemia as the Duchy of Opava, ruled by his illegitimate son Duke Nicholas I. Differences in culture, traditions and economic development from the rest of Moravia then grew, mainly caused by Germanisation during the course of the Ostsiedlung. From 1526 onwards, the Duchy of Troppau, along with the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, was part of the Habsburg monarchy.

The history of Hlučín Region as an entity began with the Treaty of Breslau, signed on 11 June 1742 between King Frederick II of Prussia and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. In 1740, Prussia started the First Silesian War and conquered most of Silesia. According to the terms of the treaty, the Duchy of Troppau was partitioned: the lands south of the Opava River remained with Austrian Silesia, whereas the northern part around Hlučín fell to Prussia and was incorporated into the Province of Silesia in 1815.

On 4 February 1920, Hlučín Region was handed over without a referendum to Czechoslovakia, according to Article 83 of the Treaty of Versailles, though surveys suggested that its people felt more as being part of Upper Silesia and mostly would have preferred to join the German Weimar Republic.

Czechoslovak troops and authorities did not receive the friendly reception that they had expected as &quot;liberators&quot;. When the Czechoslovaks moved into Deutsch-Krawarn, the whole population was in the streets and sang in unison the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;.

Even though the region&#x27;s German speakers were officially protected in their rights by Czechoslovakia, repressions on language policy and schooling in German were instituted. The enforcement of a Czechoslovak identity on the citizens also raised public opposition.

On 1 October 1938, Hlučín Region was occupied by Nazi Germany, as part of the area taken from Czechoslovakia, with the Munich Agreement. However, unlike the other formerly Czechoslovak domains, it was not attached to the &quot;Reichsgau&quot; Sudetenland but again to the Prussian Province of Silesia (Upper Silesia from 1941).

After World War II, Hlučín Region, like the rest of the Sudetenland, was returned to Czechoslovakia. However, unlike millions of other German speakers in the country, the region was spared a mass expulsion, and only 3000 citizens had to emigrate.

After the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the region became part of the Czech Republic. Today, a sizable number of the region&#x27;s citizens are binationals and also have German citizenship.

<doc id="1291727" wikidata="Q845157" url="?curid=1291727" title="Booty Call">
<text>Booty Call is a 1997 American buddy comedy film directed by Jeff Pollack, and written by J. Stanford Parker (credited as Bootsie) and Takashi Bufford. The film stars Jamie Foxx, Tommy Davidson, Vivica A. Fox, and Tamala Jones. It received generally negative reviews.

==Plot==
Rushon Askins, a tender-hearted, upwardly-mobile man, has been dating his self-righteous-to-a-fault girlfriend Nikki for seven weeks. They really like each other, but their relationship has not yet been consummated; Nikki is unsure if their relationship is ready for the next stage.

Rushon asks Nikki out to dinner, but Nikki wants it to be a double date. She brings her opinionated friend and neighbor Lysterine &quot;Lysti&quot;, and Rushon comes with his &quot;bad boy&quot; buddy Bunz. Lysti and Bunz soon end up bonding as both are sexually adventurous and completely uninhibited, despite some initial bickering and resentment towards one another as each of them overplayed their roles by trying to come off as a player (Bunz) or overly high-maintenance (Lysti). Meanwhile, the more conservative and prudish Nikki decides it is time for her and Rushon to take their relationship to the next level, much to Rushon&#x27;s surprise and excitement. However, they have one small problem: this is the 1990s, and Nikki wants to practice safe sex. Rushon produces a condom and just as he removes the wrapper, Nikki&#x27;s mischievous, poorly trained, small terrier dog named &quot;Killer&quot; snatches and destroys Rushon&#x27;s only condom, forcing him to have to go out and buy more condoms. Nikki then calls Lysterine and urges her to make Bunz (also condomless) use a condom as well. Therefore, Rushon (who has to take Killer along for his walk) and Bunz go on wild, late night adventures from store to store trying to find &quot;protection&quot; before everyone&#x27;s mood evaporates. The two friends run across a wild assortment of characters which includes a Chinese medicine store owner, wacky Punjabi convenience store owners, a would-be armed robber, a hypocritical judge (Bernie Mac) and his female clerk/secret lover, and last but not least, a disobedient Killer who escapes his leash while Rushon and Bunz are in a store and leads them on a blocks-long chase.

Things soon lead to all four friends being at the hospital when Bunz accidentally shoots Rushon in the leg with a gun he took from a paranoid cabbie moments earlier. The group initially encounters a rude, unsympathetic admissions nurse who denies Rushon entry into the hospital because he has no insurance until Bunz runs across a doctor&#x27;s credentials and impersonates the doctor to get his buddy admitted into the facility. However, &quot;Doctor&quot; Bunz is soon called in to help deliver a baby, which takes priority over a flesh wound, and he loses track of Rushon who is mistaken for a patient who is scheduled to be castrated (that patient shrewdly switched charts with Rushon upon finding out about his operation). The real doctor whom Bunz is impersonating eventually surfaces which leads the admissions nurse and security to search the hospital for the group. Bunz, Lysterine, and Nikki frantically search for Rushon who is soon anesthetized and prepared for castration. Nikki finds him right before the surgery begins and abruptly stops it by yelling that Rushon has no insurance. As both couples leave the hospital, everyone make up as both women take their men home for some long-delayed, kinky but safe sex.

==Cast==
* Tommy Davidson – Rushon Askins
* Jamie Foxx – Bunz
* Vivica A. Fox – Lysterine
* Tamala Jones – Nikki
* Amy Monique Waddell – Arguing Woman
* Art Malik – Akmed
* Bernie Mac – Judge Peabody
* David Hemblen – Dr. Blade
* Amanda Tapping – Dr. Moore
* Gedde Watanabe – Chan
* Karen Robinson – Admitting Nurse
* Ric Young – Mr. Chiu
* Scott LaRose – Singh

==Production==
The original script was heavily rewritten by director Jeff Pollack and Tommy Davidson. Prior to the film&#x27;s release, it was noted that there were similarities with its condom plot to another film in development, &quot;Trojan War&quot;, which featured an all-white cast and which would also be released in 1997. Takashi Bufford said &quot;Booty Call&quot; was written entirely without knowledge of &quot;Trojan War&quot;&#x27;s existence and said &quot;Sometimes these things just bubble up from the zeitgeist.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes it has a 31% rating based on reviews from 13 critics. 
Siskel and Ebert gave the film two thumbs up on a 1997 episode of their program. They praised the crude humor, comparing it to &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. Ebert in particular said the scenes involving Nikki&#x27;s pet Jack Russell Terrier were &quot;very, very funny.&quot; In his review, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed &quot;this contemporary sex farce, directed by Jeff Pollack, has the attention span of a hyperactive child.&quot; Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; labelled it &quot;oddly effective&quot;, and said &quot;a mixed bag of street humor, broad, bawdy jokes and hip-hop music, the film is very much on target to score a bull’s-eye with African-American auds.&quot;

A mixed review at the time came from Mike D&#x27;Angelo of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; who gave it a C rating. D&#x27;Angelo wrote, &quot;no, &quot;Booty Call&quot; has nothing to do with pirates and their ill-gotten gain. Then again, maybe there is: Two modern-day swashbucklers (Jamie Foxx and Tommy Davidson) yearn to plunder two willing maidens (Vivica A. Fox and Tamala Jones), but first they have to locate a couple of sheaths for their swords, if you know what I mean.&quot; D&#x27;Angelo went on to write, &quot;most of the time, the amiable foursome is left ambling aimlessly from one so-so sketch concept to the next: four characters in search of a comedy.&quot; Bruce Walker of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also had a mixed review, writing, &quot;the name is enough to clue you in that this is not highbrow humor. In fact, it will appeal mostly to those who can appreciate basic juvenile humor.&quot; He added, &quot;the movie seems more like a series of skits, some of which work and some of which don&#x27;t.&quot;

In a 1997 interview with Charlie Rose, black actor and filmmaker Charles S. Dutton criticized young African-Americans who went to see &quot;Booty Call&quot; rather than the historical drama &quot;Rosewood&quot;, which was released around the same time. It was later referenced in a 1999 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Beyond Blunderdome&quot;, where a film executive character labels a fictitious director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Booty Call&quot; as &quot;fabulous&quot;.
