<text>, better known as  or Keijirō (慶次郎), was a Japanese samurai lord of the Sengoku period through early Edo period. He was the nephew of Maeda Toshiie and Maeda Matsu. In legends and fictions, he is one of the most celebrated &quot;kabukimono&quot; (samurai gangster) of the time period who is known for his monstrous height and his peerless strength. Toshimasu&#x27;s horse and companion, Matsukaze, was one of the most famous warhorses in Japan.

==Biography==
In 1543, Toshimasu was born in the village of Arako (present-day Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya), Toshimasu was born to the Takigawa Clan, originally the son of Takigawa Kazumasu. He was adopted by Maeda Toshihisa, the older brother of Maeda Toshiie. Toshimasu served under Oda Nobunaga along with his uncle. Toshimasu was originally intended to inherit Maeda family headship; however, after Oda Nobunaga replaced Toshihisa with Toshiie as Maeda family head, he lost this position. Perhaps because of this loss of inheritance, Toshimasu is well known for quarreling with his uncle.

Keiji&#x27;s armor can still be seen today at the Miyasaka Museum.

In 1581, Toshimasu was under the command of his uncle, and made a reputation for himself through conflicts within Noto Province and was rewarded with 5,000 koku. 

In 1584, during the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Toshimasu came with Maeda Toshiie&#x27;s to rescue Suemori Castle when was attacked by Sassa Narimasa. 

When Maeda Toshihisa died in 1587, Toshimasu sent his son into the Maeda family&#x27;s service. Keiji was barred from Toyotomi&#x27;s Kyushu Campaign for his wild ways. 

In 1590, he continued to help his uncle in the Odawara campaign. After Odawara campaign, Toshimasu returned to the capital and devoted himself to arts and literature. Either after Toshihisa&#x27;s death or in 1590, relations between him and Toshiie grew sour. He fled from the Maeda family without taking his wife or child. After his escape, he resided in Kyoto. While in Kyoto, Toshimasu met and befriended Naoe Kanetsugu from the Uesugi clan. The two became close friends, and Toshimasu agreed to join Kanetsugu at Sekigahara Campaign, in the Uesugi clan&#x27;s invasion of Aizu. 

Later in 1600, at the Siege of Hasedō against Mogami clan and Date clan. He was led the center garrison of Uesugi forces, after Uesugi failed, Toshimasu was appointed to lead the rear guard during the retreat. Riding his horse &quot;Matsukaze&quot; into battle and brandishing a two-pronged spear, he made a splendid show of force. Due in part to Toshimasu&#x27;s actions, the Uesugi forces were able to retreat largely intact. Legend says he broke through the enemy lines with only eight riders, and shattered their formation. After the Uesugi clan&#x27;s move to the Yonezawa Domain, Toshimasu remained as a retainer and spent half retired life at Mukuan (Toshimasu`s fortified residence).

==Matsukaze==
Matsukaze (&quot;wind in the pines&quot;) was Toshimasu&#x27;s famous mount. According to the legend, he was bred of only the finest horses, but he refused to let anyone ride him and eventually ran away. Toshimasu managed to tame the wild horse, possibly due to Toshimasu&#x27;s own wild personality. Since then, the two were never seen apart.

Matsukaze was said to be a horse of immense strength, able to carry his master&#x27;s large frame for days. Supposedly, Matsukaze ran away after his master&#x27;s death, never seen again.

== Depictions in fiction ==
Toshimasu is a playable character from the Western Army in the original &quot;Kessen&quot; and in &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; under the name Keiji.

He is also playable in the &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot; series, as Maeda Keiji.

He is a playable character in &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot; (Pokémon + Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition in Japan), with his partner Pokémon being Bastiodon and Terrakion.

In 2015, Tatsuya Fuji played the role of Toshimasu in the jidaigeki drama Kabukimono Keiji.

<doc id="1275715" wikidata="Q1301614" url="?curid=1275715" title="Macris">
<text>In Greek mythology, Macris (Ancient Greek: Μακρἰς meaning &quot;far away&quot; or &quot;long&quot;, a reference to the elongated shape of Euboea) was a daughter of Aristaeus and Autonoe.

== Mythology ==
Macris reared the young Hera in Euboea during the goddess&#x27; early childhood in some versions. One day Hera&#x27;s brother Zeus stole her away, where Mount Cithaeron, in the words of Plutarch, &quot;afforded them a shady recess&quot;. When Macris came looking for her ward, the mountain-god Cithaeron drove her away from the couple, saying that Zeus was taking his pleasure there with the goddess Leto.

Sometime later, Macris gave newborn Dionysus honey to eat on Euboea after Hermes saved him. Macris was expelled from Euboea by Hera as punishment. Macris fled to a cave on a small island where she was helped by the goddess Demeter. Demeter taught the residents of the island how to grow cereal grain. According to a scholiast commenting on verses in Argonautica, the island she fled to was subsequently named after her. Apollonius Rhodius, who composed &quot;Argonautica&quot;, only refers to the island as &quot;Drepane&quot; but he does mention its connection with Macris and Demeter. Modern Scholars have identified the island with modern Corfu, the historical &quot;Corcyra&quot;. According to Apollonius of Rhodes, the cave where Macris once lived was later the marriage chamber for Jason and Medea, and the marriage was consummated there on the Golden Fleece. Thereafter Macris&#x27;s cave was called &quot;Medea&#x27;s Cave&quot;.

<text>Ogoniok (; pre-reform orthography: Огонекъ) was one of the oldest weekly illustrated magazines in Russia.

==History and profile==
&quot;Ogoniok&quot; was first issued on (earlier a magazine with the same name was published in 1879–1883). It ceased to be published in 1918 and was re-established in the Soviet Union in 1923 by Mikhail Koltsov. The headquarters is in Moscow. In 1957 the circulation of the magazine was 850,000 copies.

The colour magazine reached the pinnacle of its popularity in the Perestroika years, when its editor-in-chief Vitaly Korotich &quot;was guiding &quot;Ogoniok&quot; to a pro-American and pro-capitalist position&quot;. Those years are the subject matter of the book &quot;Small Fires: Letters From the Soviet People to Ogonyok Magazine 1987-1990&quot; (Summit Books, New York, 1990) selected and edited by Christopher Cerf, Marina Albee, and with an introduction by Korotich. The magazine sold 1.5 million copies in 1987 and 4.6 million copies in 1990.

In the early 1990s, &quot;Ogoniok&quot; was owned by Boris Berezovsky, and its popularity started to decline. It sold 0.2 million copies in 1993. Viktor Loshak, the former editor of &quot;Moskovskiye Novosti&quot;, took over as editor in 2003. , it was published by the Russian OVA-PRESS publishing house. At the height of the 2008–2009 Russian financial crisis, in January 2009, the publication was suspended due to an ownership change.

After a four-month break, publication of &quot;Ogoniok&quot; was resumed on 18 May 2009, by Kommersant Publishing Group. The first issue published by &quot;Kommersant&quot; is the 5079th &quot;Ogoniok&quot; since 1899.

In December 2020, release of &quot;Ogoniok&quot; was suspended due to financial problems.

<doc id="1275728" wikidata="Q7579591" url="?curid=1275728" title="Sporting Options">
<text>Sporting Options was an English betting exchange, based in Sussex. The company was founded in 2000 by former City of London options traders Robert Byrne and Kevin Griffiths. Sporting Options went into administration on 15 November 2004 amid allegations of criminal wrongdoing. Industry leader Betfair stepped in with a rescue package.

==Cause of collapse==
Sporting Options appeared to be matching bets worth up to 15% of those matched at Betfair. But it was alleged the turnover was being financed by the owners of Sporting Options using their own funds to create the liquidity.

By late 2004, it was alleged Sporting Options was in fact fraudulently financing its apparent liquidity by using funds from its own clients&#x27; account. On 15 November 2004 administrators were called in. By 8 December the administrators had determined that the company owed £3.6 million to its clients, but held only minimal funds in the clients&#x27; account.

==Betfair rescue package==
Soon after Sporting Options went into administration, Betfair announced a rescue package to compensate the 5,342 Sporting Options clients who had lost money. The clients affected were required to register as customers of Betfair to be eligible. Each qualifying client owed less than £1,000 was compensated for the full amount owing (in the form of a credit to his or her Betfair account). Those owed more than £1,000 received either £1,000 or 20 per cent of their Sporting Options account balance, whichever was greater. Any amount owing over and above this payout could be earned back though a commission rebate program, valid through to 30 November 2006.

Some speculated that Betfair&#x27;s apparent act of generosity was a bid to protect the reputation of the betting exchange industry, while simultaneously securing exclusive access to Sporting Options&#x27; clients. Betfair and most other exchanges have stressed their clients&#x27; funds are ring-fenced to ensure the exchanges&#x27; financial integrity.

<text>Andrew Ronald Brideson is an Australian politician. He was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1992 until 2006, representing Waverley Province. A former teacher and trade unionist, he was a backbencher for about half of his career. The other half was spent as Chairman of the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee 1996-99 and Chairman of the prestigious Road Safety Committee from 1999–2002. He served two years as Shadow Cabinet Secretary in an understaffed shadow ministry from 2002- 2004. He did not contest the 2006 state election, having a long-standing belief that political parties need to regenerate.

==Early life and education==
Brideson was born in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, and studied at Bentleigh and McKinnon High Schools. He studied teaching at Frankston Teachers College and the Hawthorn Institute of Education

==Teaching career==
Brideson occupied teaching positions at various rural schools in the West Gippsland and Wimmera regions between 1964 and 1975. In 1976, he was promoted to the position of deputy principal, and worked in this position in a number of schools.

During his teaching career, Brideson had been an active trade unionist in both the Teachers Association of Australia and Victorian Affiliated Teachers Federation, and at the end of the 1983 school year, took up positions heading both organisations. In a rare move for a unionist, Brideson acted as an advisor to several shadow ministers in the conservative Liberal Party state opposition of the time. He was an active participant in the Victorian Trades Hall Council and was a delegate at ACTU conferences. He led the Victorian organisation until his move into politics in October 1992.

==Politics==
In the leadup to the 1992 state election, Brideson succeeded in obtaining Liberal preselection for the seat of Waverley Province which was held by the Labor Party. In his first six-year term, he served on the Public Bodies Review Committee (1992–1996).He also served as the parliamentary representative on the Monash University Council from 1997. However, he was overlooked for a ministerial position in Jeff Kennett&#x27;s Liberal government.

He was re-elected at the 1999 election, which saw the Liberal Party lose power to the Labor Party under Steve Bracks, but was subsequently appointed Chairman of the Road Safety Committee regardless. In this way, he headed an inquiry that aimed to bring down the number of road deaths, after it had reached its highest number for several years. Though his term was for the most part relatively uneventful, Brideson was involved in a minor scandal in 2001 when he was accused of plagiarising parts of a parliamentary report by taking slabs of material directly from the internet.

Brideson did not face election in 2002, which saw the Liberal opposition defeated in a landslide, which saw the other Liberal member for Waverley Province lose their seat, as well as several shadow members. The devastating loss opened up numerous shadow ministerial positions, and Brideson was given the portfolios of scrutiny of government and waste watch and appointed as the Secretary to the Shadow Cabinet. He was a relatively low-profile figure in these roles, however, and received far less attention than his predecessor, David Davis. He subsequently lost the first two positions to younger MLC Richard Dalla-Riva in January 2004, though he remained Secretary to the Shadow Cabinet without portfolio for the remainder of his career.

Brideson kept a particularly low profile after his demotion, and rumours of his impending retirement began circulating in late 2004. On 11 March 2005, Brideson became the second Liberal frontbencher to announce publicly that he would not be contesting his seat at the 2006 state election. He also suggested that other older Liberal MPs should consider stepping down at the election.

<text>Prydain (, ; Middle Welsh: Prydein) is the modern Welsh name for Great Britain.

==Medieval==

&quot;Prydain&quot; is the medieval Welsh term for the island of Britain. The Latin name Albion was not used by the Welsh. More specifically, Prydain may refer to the Brittonic parts of the island; that is, the parts south of Caledonia. This distinction appears to derive from Roman times, when the island was divided into Roman Britain to the south and the land of the Caledonians to the North. The peoples north of the Roman borders eventually came to be known as the Picts (Welsh: &quot;Brithwyr&quot;); the Welsh term for Pictland was &quot;Prydyn&quot;, which caused some confusion in the texts with &quot;Prydain&quot;.

In Middle Welsh texts, the related term &quot;Ynys Prydein&quot; (Island of Britain), or &quot;Ynys Brydein&quot;, can also refer to the island (&quot;ynys&quot;) itself but more often is a name for the Brittonic territories south of Caledonia. It is in this context that the name of the collection of traditional material arranged in triads known as &quot;Trioedd Ynys Prydein&quot; should be understood. In modern Welsh &quot;ynys&quot; means &#x27;island&#x27;, but in Middle Welsh it can also mean &#x27;land&#x27; or &#x27;realm&#x27; (cf. Latin &quot;insula&quot;).

There are numerous other instances of the term &quot;Prydain&quot; in medieval Welsh texts. One of the best known is found in the title of the 10th-century vaticinatory poem &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; (&#x27;The Prophecy of Britain&#x27;).

==In popular culture==
Prydain is also used by Lloyd Alexander as the name for the realm in which his fantasy book series &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; takes place.

<doc id="1275748" wikidata="Q887684" url="?curid=1275748" title="Muslim conquest of Persia">
<text>As part of the early Muslim conquests, which were initiated by Muhammad in 622, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the Sasanian Empire between 632 and 654. This event led to the decline of Zoroastrianism, which had been the official religion of Persia (or Iran) since the time of the Achaemenid Empire. The persecution of Zoroastrians by the early Muslims during and after this conflict prompted many of them to flee eastward to India, where they were granted refuge by various kings.

While Arabia was experiencing the rise of Islam in the 7th century, Persia was struggling with unprecedented levels of political, social, economic, and military weakness; the Sasanian army had greatly exhausted itself in the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. Following the execution of Sasanian shah Khosrow II in 628, Persia&#x27;s internal political stability began deteriorating at a rapid pace. Subsequently, ten new royal claimants were enthroned within the next four years. Shortly afterwards, Persia was further devastated by the Sasanian Interregnum, a large-scale civil war that began in 628 and resulted in the government&#x27;s decentralization by 632.

Amidst Persia&#x27;s turmoil, the first Rashidun invasion of Sasanian territory took place in 633, when the Rashidun army conquered parts of Asoristan, which was the Sasanians&#x27; political and economic centre in Mesopotamia. Later, the regional Rashidun army commander Khalid ibn al-Walid was transferred to oversee the Muslim conquest of the Levant, and as the Rashidun army became increasingly focused on the Byzantine Empire, the newly conquered Mesopotamian territories were retaken by the Sasanian army. The second Rashidun invasion began in 636, under Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas, when a key victory at the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah permanently ended all Sasanian control to the west of modern-day Iran. For the next six years, the Zagros Mountains, a natural barrier, marked the political boundary between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Sasanian Empire. In 642, Umar ibn al-Khattab, eight years into his reign as Islam&#x27;s second caliph, ordered a full-scale invasion of the rest of the Sasanian Empire. Directing the war from the city of Medina in Arabia, Umar&#x27;s quick conquest of Persia in a series of coordinated and multi-pronged attacks became his greatest triumph, contributing to his reputation as a great military and political strategist. In 644, however, he was assassinated by the Persian craftsman Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a Firuz, who had been captured by Rashidun troops and brought to Arabia as a slave.

Some Iranian historians have defended their forebears by using Arab sources to illustrate that &quot;contrary to the claims of some historians, Iranians, in fact, fought long and hard against the invading Arabs.&quot; By 651, most of the urban centres in Iranian lands, with the notable exception of the provinces along the Caspian Sea (i.e., in Tabaristan and Transoxiana), had come under Muslim domination. Many localities fought against the invaders; although the Rashidun army had established hegemony over most of the country, many cities rose in rebellion by killing their Arab governors or attacking their garrisons. Eventually, military reinforcements quashed the Iranian insurgencies and imposed complete control. The Islamization of Iran was gradual and incentivized in various ways over a period of centuries, though some Iranians never converted and there is widespread evidence of Zoroastrian scriptures and all other pre-Islamic being systematically burnt and Zoroastrian priests being executed, particularly in areas that were centers of resistance. Islam had become Iran&#x27;s predominant religion by the Late Middle Ages; the majority of Iranians were Sunni Muslims until the Safavids forcefully converted Iran to Shia Islam in the 16th century.

This was the first time since the collapse of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC with the Battle of Opis, that Mesopotamia was ruled again by Semitic-speaking people, after centuries of Persian (Achaemenid, Parthian and Sasanian empires), and Roman-Greek (Macedonian, Seleucid, and Roman empires) ruling periods.

==Historiography and recent scholarship==

When Western academics first investigated the Muslim conquest of Persia, they relied solely on the accounts of the Armenian Christian bishop Sebeos, and accounts in Arabic written some time after the events they describe. The most significant work was probably that of Arthur Christensen, and his &quot;L’Iran sous les Sassanides&quot;, published in Copenhagen and Paris in 1944.

Recent scholarship has begun to question the traditional narrative: Parvaneh Pourshariati, in her &quot;Decline and Fall of the Sasanian Empire: The Sasanian-Parthian Confederacy and the Arab Conquest of Iran&quot;, published in 2008, provides both a detailed overview of the problematic nature of trying to establish exactly what happened, and a great deal of original research that questions fundamental facts of the traditional narrative, including the timeline and specific dates.

Pourshariati&#x27;s central thesis is that contrary to what was commonly assumed, the Sassanian Empire was highly decentralized, and was in fact a &quot;confederation&quot; with the Parthians, who themselves retained a high level of independence. Despite their recent victories over the Byzantine Empire, the Parthians unexpectedly withdrew from the confederation, and the Sassanians were thus ill-prepared and ill-equipped to mount an effective and cohesive defense against the Muslim armies. Moreover, the powerful northern and eastern Parthian families, the kust-i khwarasan and kust-i adurbadagan, withdrew to their respective strongholds and made peace with the Arabs, refusing to fight alongside the Sassanians.

Another important theme of Pourshariati&#x27;s study is a re-evaluation of the traditional timeline. Pourshariati argues that the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia &quot;took place, not, as has been conventionally believed, in the years 632–634, after the accession of the last Sasanian king Yazdgerd III (632–651) to power, but in the period from 628 to 632.&quot; An important consequence of this change in timeline means that the Arab conquest started precisely when the Sassanians and Parthians were engaged in internecine warfare over succession to the Sassanian throne.

==Sasanian Empire before the conquest==
Since the 1st century BC, the border between the Roman (later Byzantine) and Parthian (later Sasanian) empires had been the Euphrates River. The border was constantly contested. Most battles, and thus most fortifications, were concentrated in the hilly regions of the north, as the vast Arabian or Syrian Desert (Roman Arabia) separated the rival empires in the south. The only dangers expected from the south were occasional raids by nomadic Arab tribesmen. Both empires therefore allied themselves with small, semi-independent Arab principalities, which served as buffer states and protected Byzantium and Persia from Bedouin attacks. The Byzantine clients were the Ghassanids; the Persian clients were the Lakhmids. The Ghassanids and Lakhmids feuded constantly, which kept them occupied, but that did not greatly affect the Byzantines or the Persians. In the 6th and 7th centuries, various factors destroyed the balance of power that had held for so many centuries.

The conflict with the Byzantines greatly contributed to its weakness, by draining Sassanid resources, leaving it a prime target for the Muslims.

===Social problems===
Sasanian society was divided into four classes: priests, warriors, secretaries, and commoners. The latter formed the bulk of the population, served as its sole tax base, and remained its poorest class.

At the climax of Khosrow II&#x27;s ambitious Byzantine territory conquests in the Levant and much of Asia Minor, taxes rose dramatically, and most people could not pay. Years of Sassanid-Byzantine wars had ruined trade routes and industry, the population&#x27;s main income sources. The existing Sassanid administrative structure proved inadequate when faced with the combined demands of a suddenly expanded empire, economy, and population. Rapid turnover of rulers and increasing provincial landholder (dehqan) power further diminished the Sasanians. Over a period of fourteen years and twelve successive kings, the Sassanid Empire weakened considerably, and the power of the central authority passed into the hands of its generals. Even when a strong king emerged following a series of coups, the Sassanids never completely recovered.

===Events===
====Revolt of the Arab client states (602)====
The Byzantine clients, the Arab Ghassanids, converted to the Monophysite form of Christianity, which was regarded as heretical by the established Byzantine Eastern Orthodox Church. The Byzantines attempted to suppress the heresy, alienating the Ghassanids and sparking rebellions on their desert frontiers. The Lakhmids also revolted against the Persian king Khusrau II. Nu&#x27;man III (son of Al-Monder IV), the first Christian Lakhmid king, was deposed and killed by Khusrau II in 602, because of his attempt to throw off Persian suzerainty. After Khusrau&#x27;s assassination in 628, the Persian Empire fractured and the Lakhmids were effectively semi-independent. It is now widely believed that the annexation of the Lakhmid kingdom was one of the main factors behind the fall of the Sasanian Empire and the subsequent Islamic conquest of Persia, as the Lakhmids agreed to act as spies for the Muslims after being defeated in the Battle of Hira by Khalid ibn al-Walid.

====Byzantine–Sassanid War (602–628)====
The Persian ruler Khosrau II (Parviz) defeated a dangerous rebellion within his own empire, Bahram Chobin&#x27;s rebellion. He then turned his focus to his traditional Byzantine enemies, leading to the Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628. For a few years, he succeeded. From 612 to 622, he extended the Persian borders almost to the same extent that they were under the Achaemenid dynasty (550–330 BC), capturing Western states as far as Egypt, Palestine (the conquest of the latter being assisted by a Jewish army), and more.

The Byzantines regrouped and pushed back in 622 under Heraclius. Khosrau was defeated at the Battle of Nineveh in 627, and the Byzantines recaptured all of Syria and penetrated far into the Persian provinces of Mesopotamia. In 629, Khosrau&#x27;s general Shahrbaraz agreed to peace, and the border between the two empires was once again the same as it had been in 602.

====Plague of Sheroe====

The Plague of Sheroe (627–628) was one of several epidemics that occurred in or close to Iran within two centuries after the first epidemic was brought by the Sasanian armies from its campaigns in Constantinople, Syria, and Armenia. It caused the death of many Aryan and therefore contributed to the fall of the Sasanian Empire.

====Execution of Khosrau II====

Khosrau II was executed in 628 and, as a result, there were numerous claimants to the throne; from 628 to 632 there were ten kings and queens of Persia. The last, Yazdegerd III, was a grandson of Khosrau II and was said to be a mere child aged 8 years.

====Muhammad&#x27;s Letter====
After the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in 628, Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad sent many letters to the princes, kings, and chiefs of the various tribes and kingdoms of the time, exhorting them to convert to Islam and bow to the order of God. These letters were carried by ambassadors to Persia, Byzantium, Ethiopia, Egypt, Yemen, and the city of Al-Hirah in Iraq on the same day. This assertion has been brought under scrutiny by some modern historians of Islam—notably Grimme and Caetani. Particularly in dispute is the assertion that Khosrau II received a letter from Muhammad, as the Sassanid court ceremony was notoriously intricate, and it is unlikely that a letter from what at the time was a minor regional power would have reached the hands of the Shahanshah.

With regards to Persia, Muslim histories further recount that at the beginning of the seventh year of migration, Muhammad appointed one of his officers, Abdullah Huzafah Sahmi Qarashi, to carry his letter to Khosrow II inviting him to convert:

There are differing accounts of the reaction of Khosrow II.

===Military===

Years of warfare between the Sasanians and the Byzantines, as well as the strain of the Khazar invasion of Transcaucasia, had exhausted the army. No effective ruler followed Khosrau II, causing chaos in society and problems in the provincial administration, until Yazdegerd III rose to power. All these factors undermined the strength of the Persian army. Yazdegerd III was merely 8 years old when he came to the throne and, lacking experience, did not try to rebuild the army. The Sasanian Empire was highly decentralized, and was in fact a &quot;confederation&quot; with the Parthians, who themselves retained a high level of independence. After the last Sasanian-Byzantine war, the Parthians wanted to withdraw from the confederation, and the Sasanians were thus ill-prepared and ill-equipped to mount an effective and cohesive defense against the Muslim armies. Moreover, the powerful northern and eastern Parthian families, the Kust-i Khwarasan and Kust-i Adurbadagan, withdrew to their respective strongholds and made peace with the Arabs, refusing to fight alongside the Sasanians.

Pourshariati argues that the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia &quot;took place, not, as has been conventionally believed, in the years 632–634, after the accession of the last Sasanian king Yazdgerd III (632–651) to power, but in the period from 628 to 632.&quot; An important consequence of this change in timeline means that the Arab conquest started precisely when the Sasanians and Parthians were engaged in internecine warfare over who was to succeed the Sasanian throne.

When Arab squadrons made their first raids into Sasanian territory, Yazdegerd III did not consider them a threat, and he refused to send an army to encounter the invaders. When the main Arab army reached the Persian borders, Yazdegerd III procrastinated in dispatching an army against the Arabs. Even Rostam-e Farokhzad, who was both Eran Spahbod and Viceroy, did not see the Arabs as a threat. Without opposition, the Arabs had time to consolidate and fortify their positions.

When hostilities between the Sasanians and the Arabs finally began, the Persian army faced fundamental problems. While their heavy cavalry had proved effective against the Roman forces, it was too slow and regimented to act with full force against the agile and unpredictable lightly armed Arab cavalry and foot archers.

The Persian army had a few initial successes. War elephants temporarily halted the Arab army, but when Arab veterans returned from the Syrian fronts, where they had been fighting against Byzantine forces, they provided crucial instruction on how to effectively counter the war elephants.

These factors contributed to the decisive Sassanid defeat at the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. The Persians, who had only one generation before conquered Egypt and Asia Minor, lost decisive battles when nimble, lightly armed Arabs accustomed to skirmishes and desert warfare attacked them. The Arab squadrons defeated the Persian army in several more battles culminating in the Battle of Nahāvand, the last major battle of the Sassanids. The Sassanid dynasty came to an end with the death of Yazdegerd III in 651.

==Rise of the Caliphate==
Muhammad died in June 632, and Abu Bakr took the title of Caliph and political successor at Medina. Soon after Abu Bakr&#x27;s succession, several Arab tribes revolted, in the Ridda Wars (Arabic for the Wars of Apostasy). The Ridda Wars preoccupied the Caliphate until March 633, and ended with the entirety of the Arab Peninsula under the authority of the Caliph at Medina.

Abu Bakr set in motion a historical trajectory (continued later by Umar and Uthman) that in a few decades led to one of the largest empires in history, beginning with a confrontation with the Sassanid Empire under the general Khalid ibn al-Walid.

==Conquest of Mesopotamia (633–638)==
===First invasion (633)===
After the Ridda wars, a tribal chief of northeastern Arabia, Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha, raided the Sasanian towns in Mesopotamia, actions that generated a considerable amount of booty was collected. Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha went to Medina to inform Abu Bakr about his success and was appointed commander of his people, after which he began to raid deeper into Mesopotamia. Using the mobility of his light cavalry, he could easily raid any town near the desert and disappear again into the desert, beyond the reach of the Sasanian army. Al-Muthanna&#x27;s acts made Abu Bakr think about the expansion of the Rashidun Caliphate.

To ensure victory, Abu Bakr used a volunteer army and put his best general, Khalid ibn al-Walid, in command. After defeating the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama, Khalid was still at Al-Yamama when Abu Bakr ordered him to invade the Sasanian Empire. Making Al-Hirah the objective of Khalid, Abu Bakr sent reinforcements and ordered the tribal chiefs of northeastern Arabia, Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha, Mazhur bin Adi, Harmala and Sulma to operate under Khalid&#x27;s command. Around the third week of March 633 (first week of Muharram 12th Hijrah) Khalid set out from Al-Yamama with an army of 10,000. The tribal chiefs, with 2,000 warriors each, joined him, swelling his ranks to 18,000. After entering Mesopotamia, he dispatched messages to every governor and deputy who ruled the provinces calling on them to either embrace Islam or pay tribute. Khalid did not receive any responses and continued with his tactical plans.

Khalid went on to win decisive victories in four consecutive battles: the Battle of Chains, fought in April; the Battle of River, fought in the third week of April; the Battle of Walaja the following month (where he successfully used a double envelopment manoeuvre), and the Battle of Ullais, fought in mid-May. The Persian court, already disturbed by internal problems, was thrown into chaos. In the last week of May, the important city of Al-Hirah fell to the Muslims. After resting his armies, in June, Khalid laid siege to the city of al-Anbar, which surrendered in July. Khalid then moved south, and conquered the city of Ayn al-Tamr in the last week of July. At this point, most of what is now Iraq was under Islamic control.

Khalid received a call for aid from northern Arabia at Dawmat al-Jandal, where another Muslim Arab general, Iyad ibn Ghanm, was trapped among the rebel tribes. Khalid went there and defeated the rebels in the Battle of Dawmat al-Jandal in the last week of August. Upon his return, he received news of the assembling of a large Persian army. He decided to defeat them all separately to avoid the risk of being defeated by a large unified Persian army. Four divisions of Persian and Christian Arab auxiliaries were present at Hanafiz, Zumiel, Sanni and Muzieh. Khalid divided his army into three units, and employed them in well-coordinated attacks against the Persians from three different sides at night, in the Battle of Muzayyah, then the Battle of Saniyy, and finally the Battle of Zumail, all during the month of November. These devastating defeats ended Persian control over Mesopotamia, and left the Persian capital Ctesiphon vulnerable. Before attacking Ctesiphon, Khalid decided to eliminate all Persian forces in the south and west. He accordingly marched against the border city of Firaz, where he allegedly defeated the combined forces of the Sasanian Persians, the Byzantines and Christian Arabs in December. However this has been disputed, as there is doubt to any large-scale Persian forces, and the suspect elements of the battle including casualty numbers and a lack of names of allied commanders point to an Islamic cover-up, which may have in fact been a defeat of Khalid. This battle was the last in his conquest of Mesopotamia. While Khalid was on his way to attack Qadissiyah (a key fort en route to Ctesiphon), Abu Bakr ordered him to the Roman front in Syria to assume command there.

===Second invasion (634–636)===
====Battle of the Bridge====

According to the will of Abu Bakr, Umar was to continue the conquest of Syria and Mesopotamia. On the northeastern borders of the Empire, in Mesopotamia, the situation was rapidly deteriorating. During Abu Bakr&#x27;s era, Khalid ibn al-Walid had left Mesopotamia with half his army of 9000 soldiers to assume command in Syria, whereupon the Persians decided to take back their lost territory. The Muslim army was forced to leave the conquered areas and concentrate on the border. Umar immediately sent reinforcements to aid Muthanna ibn Haritha in Mesopotamia under the command of Abu Ubaid al-Thaqafi. At that time, a series of battles between the Persians and Arabs occurred in the region of Sawad, such as Namaraq, Kaskar and Baqusiatha, in which the Arabs managed to maintain their presence in the area. Later on, the Persians defeated Abu Ubaid in the Battle of the Bridge. Muthanna bin Haritha was later victorious in the Battle of Buwayb. In 635 Yazdgerd III sought an alliance with Emperor Heraclius of the Eastern Roman Empire, marrying the latter&#x27;s daughter (or, by some traditions, his granddaughter) in order to seal the arrangement. While Heraclius prepared for a major offence in the Levant, Yazdegerd ordered the concentration of massive armies to push the Muslims out of Mesopotamia for good through a series of well-coordinated attacks on two fronts.


====Battle of Qadisiyyah====

Umar ordered his army to retreat to the Arabian border and began raising armies at Medina for another campaign into Mesopotamia. Owing to the critical situation, Umar wished to command the army personally, but the members of Majlis ash-Shura demurred, claiming that the two-front war required Umar&#x27;s presence in Medina. Accordingly, Umar appointed Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, a respected senior officer, even though Saad was suffering from sciatica. Saad left Medina with his army in May 636 and arrived at Qadisiyyah in June.

While Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd was unable to muster his armies in time to provide the Byzantines with Persian support. Umar, allegedly aware of this alliance and not wanting to risk a battle with two great powers simultaneously, quickly reinforced the Muslim army at Yarmouk to engage and defeat the Byzantines. Meanwhile, he ordered Saad to enter into peace negotiations with Yazdegerd III and invite him to convert to Islam to prevent Persian forces from taking the field. Heraclius instructed his general Vahan not to engage in battle with the Muslims before receiving explicit orders. Fearing more Arab reinforcements, Vahan attacked the Muslim army in the Battle of Yarmouk in August 636, and was routed.

With the Byzantine threat ended, the Sasanian Empire was still a formidable power with vast manpower reserves, and the Arabs soon found themselves confronting a huge Persian army with troops drawn from every corner of the empire, including war elephants, and commanded by its foremost generals. Within three months, Saad defeated the Persian army in the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, effectively ending Sasanian rule west of Persia proper. This victory is largely regarded as a decisive turning point in Islam&#x27;s growth: with the bulk of Persian forces defeated, Saad with his companions later conquered Babylon (Battle of Babylon (636)), Kūthā, Sābāṭ (Valashabad) and Bahurasīr (Veh-Ardashir). Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, fell in March 637 after a siege of three months.

===Final campaign and conquest (636–638)===
In December 636, Umar ordered Utbah ibn Ghazwan to head south to capture al-Ubulla (known as &quot;port of Apologos&quot; in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea) and Basra, in order to cut ties between the Persian garrison there and Ctesiphon. Utbah ibn Ghazwan arrived in April 637, and captured the region. The Persians withdrew to the Maysan region, which the Muslims seized later as well.

After the conquest of Ctesiphon, several detachments were immediately sent west to capture Circesium and Heet, both forts at the Byzantine border. Several fortified Persian armies were still active north-east of Ctesiphon at Jalawla and north of the Tigris at Tikrit and Mosul.

After withdrawal from Ctesiphon, the Persian armies gathered at Jalawla, a place of strategic importance due to routes leading from here to Mesopotamia, Khurasan and Azerbaijan. The Persian forces at Jalawla were commanded by Mihran. His deputy was Farrukhzad, a brother of Rustam, who had commanded the Persian forces at the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah. Umar decided to deal with Jalawla first, thereby clearing the way to the north, before taking any decisive action against Tikrit and Mosul. Umar appointed Hashim ibn Utbah to take Jalawla and Abdullah ibn Muta&#x27;am to conquer Tikrit and Mosul. In April 637, Hashim led 12,000 troops from Ctesiphon to win a victory over the Persians at the Battle of Jalawla. He then laid siege to Jalawla for seven months, ending in the city&#x27;s capture. Then, Abdullah ibn Muta&#x27;am marched against Tikrit and captured the city with the help of Christians, after fierce resistance. He next sent an army to Mosul which surrendered on the condition of paying Jizya. With victory at Jalawla and occupation of the Tikrit-Mosul region, the whole of Mesopotamia was under Muslim control.

Thereafter, a Muslim force under Qa&#x27;qa marched in pursuit of the escaping Persians at Khaniqeen, 25 kilometres (15 mi) from Jalawla on the road to Iran, still under the command of Mihran. Qa&#x27;qa defeated the Persian forces in the Battle of Khaniqeen and captured the city. The Persians then withdrew to Hulwan. Qa&#x27;qa followed and laid siege to the city, which was captured in January 638. Qa&#x27;qa sought permission to operate deeper in Persia, but Umar rejected the proposal, writing in response:
==Persian raids in Mesopotamia (638–641)==
By February 638 there was a lull in the fighting on the Persian front. The Suwad, the Tigris valley, and the Euphrates valley were now under complete Muslim control. The Persians had withdrawn to Persia proper, east of the Zagros mountains. The Persians continued raiding Mesopotamia, which remained politically unstable. It seemed the Zagros range was the dividing line between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Sassanids. In the latter part of 638, Hormuzan, who was one of the seven great chiefs of Persia, and had commanded a corps at the Battle of Qadisiyyah, intensified his raids in Mesopotamia. Saad, on Umar&#x27;s instructions, attacked Hormuzan, while Utbah ibn Ghazwan, aided by Nouman ibn Muqarin, attacked Ahvaz and forced Hormuzan into a peace treaty, under which Ahvaz would remain in Hormuzan&#x27;s possession as a Muslim vassal state and would pay tribute. Hormuzan broke the treaty, leading Umar to send Abu Musa Ashaari, governor of Busra, to deal with him. After another defeat, Hormuzan signed another treaty on similar terms to the last. This peace also proved short-lived once Hormuzan was reinforced by fresh Persian troops sent by Emperor Yazdgerd III in late 640. The troops concentrated at Tuster, north of Ahvaz. Umar sent the Governor of Kufa, Ammar ibn Yasir, the governor of Busra, Abu Musa, and Nouman ibn Muqarin there, where Hormuzan was defeated, captured and sent to Umar in Medina. Hormuzan apparently converted to Islam and remained a useful adviser to Umar throughout the remainder of the Persian campaign. He is also believed to be the mastermind behind Umar&#x27;s assassination in 644.

After the victory at Tustar, Abu Musa marched against the strategically important Susa in January 641, capturing it after a siege of a couple of months. Next, Abu Musa marched against Junde Sabur, the only place left of military importance in the Persian province of Khuzistan, which surrendered to the Muslims after a siege of a few weeks.

==Battle of Nahavand (642)==
After the conquest of Khuzistan, Umar wanted peace. Though considerably weakened, the image of the Persian Empire as a fearsome superpower still resonated in the minds of the newly-ascendant Arabs, and Umar was wary of unnecessary military engagement with it, preferring to leave the rump of the Persian Empire alone, commenting, &quot;I wish there was a mountain of fire between us and the Persians, so that neither they could get to us, nor we to them.&quot;
Persian pride was hurt by the Arab conquest, making the &quot;status quo&quot; intolerable.

After the defeat of the Persian forces at the Battle of Jalula in 637, Yazdgerd III went to Rey and from there moved to Merv, where he set up his capital and directed his chiefs to conduct continuous raids in Mesopotamia. Within four years, Yazdgerd III felt powerful enough to challenge the Muslims again for control of Mesopotamia. Accordingly, he recruited 100,000 hardened veterans and young volunteers from all parts of Persia, under the command of Mardan Shah, which marched to Nahavand for the last titanic struggle with the Caliphate.

The Governor of Kufa, Ammar ibn Yasir, received intelligence of the Persian movements and concentration at Nahavand and reported them to Umar. Although Umar had expressed a desire for Mesopotamia to be his easternmost frontier, the concentration of the Persian army at Nahavand forced him to act. He now believed that as long as Persia proper remained under Sasanian rule, the raids into Mesopotamia would continue. Hudheifa ibn Al Yaman was appointed commander of the forces of Kufa, and was ordered to march to Nahavand. Abu Musa was to march to Nahavand from Busra, while Nouman ibn Muqarrin marched from Ctesiphon. Umar decided to personally take the army concentrated at Medina to Nahavand to assume overall command. The members of the Majlis al-Shura suggested that Umar should command the campaign from Medina, appointing an astute field commander for Nahavand. Umar acquiesced, appointing Mugheera ibn Shuba as commander of the forces concentrated at Medina, and Nouman ibn Muqarrin as commander-in-chief at Nahavand. The Muslim army first concentrated at Tazar, and then defeated the Persians at the Battle of Nahavand in December 642. Nouman died in the action, and, as per Umar&#x27;s instructions, Hudheifa ibn Al Yaman became the new commander-in-chief. Thereafter, the Muslims captured the whole district of Hamadan, encountering only feeble resistance.

==Conquest of Persia (642–651)==
After several years, Caliph Umar adopted a new offensive policy, preparing to launch a full-scale invasion of what remained of the Sasanian Empire. The Battle of Nahavand was one of the most decisive battles in Islamic history and proved to be the key to Persia. After the devastating defeat at Nahavand, the last Sassanid emperor, Yazdegerd III, fled to different parts of Persia to raise a new army, with limited success, while Umar attempted to capture him.

===Strategic planning for the conquest of Persia===
Umar decided to strike the Persians immediately after their defeat at Nahavand, while he still possessed a psychological advantage. Umar had to decide which of three provinces to conquer first: Fars in the south, Azerbaijan in the north or Isfahan in the center. Umar chose Isfahan, as it was the heart of the Persian Empire and a conduit for supply and communications among the Sasanian garrisons, and its capture would isolate Fars and Azerbaijan from Khorasan, Yazdegerd&#x27;s stronghold. After he had taken Fars and Isfahan, the next attacks would be simultaneously launched against Azerbaijan, the northwestern province, and Sistan, the easternmost province of the Persian Empire. The conquest of those provinces would leave Khorasan isolated and vulnerable, the last stage of the conquest of Sassanid Persia.

Preparations were complete by January 642. The success of the plan depended upon how effectively Umar could coordinate these attacks from Medina, about 1500 kilometers from Persia, and upon the skill of his field commanders. Umar adopted a different approach to the command structure. Instead of appointing a single field commander to press the campaign, Umar appointed several commanders, each assigned a different mission. Once a commander&#x27;s mission ended, he would become an ordinary soldier under the new field commander for the latter&#x27;s mission. The purpose of this strategy was to allow commanders to mix with their soldiers and to remind them that they are like everyone else: command is only given to the most competent, and, once the battle is over, the commander returns to his previous position.

On the eve of the campaign, Umar, in order to boost morale, decided to reinstall Khalid as field commander, four years after his dismissal. Khalid&#x27;s reputation as the conqueror of the Eastern Roman provinces demoralized the Persian commanders, most of whom had already been defeated by him during his conquest of Mesopotamia in 633. Before Umar could issue the reappointment order, Khalid died in Emesa.

Throughout the Persian campaign, Umar even appointed the commanders of the wings, the center and the cavalry of the army. Umar strictly instructed his commanders to consult him before making any decisive move in Persia. All the commanders, before starting their assigned campaigns, were instructed to send a detailed report of the geography and terrain of the region and the positions of the Persian garrisons, forts, cities and troops. Umar then would send them a detailed plan of how he wanted the region to be captured. Only the tactical issues were left to the field commanders to tackle in accordance with the situation they faced at their fronts. Umar appointed the best available and well-reputed commanders for the campaign.

===Conquest of Central Iran===
In the wake of Khalid&#x27;s demise, Umar appointed Abdullah ibn Uthman as commander of the Muslim forces for the invasion of Isfahan. From Nahavand, Nu&#x27;man ibn Muqaarin marched to Hamadan, and then proceeded 370 kilometres (230 mi) southeast to the city of Isfahan, defeating a Sasanian army there. The Sassanian commander, Shahrvaraz Jadhuyih, along with another Sasanian general, was killed during the battle. Nu&#x27;man, reinforced by fresh troops from Busra and Kufa under the command of Abu Musa Ashaari and Ahnaf ibn Qais, then besieged the city. The siege continued for a few months before the city surrendered.

In 651, Nu&#x27;aym ibn Muqaarin, Nu&#x27;man&#x27;s brother, marched northeast to Rey, Iran, about 320 kilometres (200 mi) from Hamadan, and laid siege to the city, which surrendered after fierce resistance. Nu&#x27;aym then marched 240 kilometres (150 mi) northeast toward Qom, which was captured without much resistance. This represented the boundary of the Isfahan region. Further northeast was Khurasan, and southeast lay Sistan. Meanwhile, Hamadan and Rey had rebelled. Umar sent Nu&#x27;aym, whose brother Nu&#x27;man had recently died, to Hamadan to crush the rebellion and clear Isfahan&#x27;s western frontier. Nu&#x27;aym recaptured Hamadan after a bloody battle, and then proceeded to Rey. There too the Persians resisted but were defeated outside the fort, and the Muslims recaptured the city. The Persian citizens sued for peace, agreeing to pay the Jizya. From Rey, Nu&#x27;aym moved north to Tabaristan, south of the Caspian Sea. The ruler of Tabaristan then signed a peace treaty with the Caliphate.

===Conquest of Fars===

====First Muslim invasion and the successful Sasanian counter-attack====
The Muslim invasion of Fars began in 638/9, when the Rashidun governor of Bahrain, al-&#x27;Ala&#x27; ibn al-Hadrami, having defeated some rebellious Arab tribes, seized an island in the Persian Gulf. Although al-&#x27;Ala&#x27; and the rest of the Arabs had been ordered to not invade Fars or its surrounding islands, he and his men continued their raids into the province. Al-&#x27;Ala quickly prepared an army which he divided into three groups, one under al-Jarud ibn Mu&#x27;alla, the second under al-Sawwar ibn Hammam, and the third under Khulayd ibn al-Mundhir ibn Sawa.

When the first group entered Fars, it was quickly defeated and al-Jarud was killed. The same thing soon happened to the second group. Khulayd and the third group kept the defenders at bay, but were blocked from withdrawing to Bahrain by the Sasanians. Umar, having found out about al-&#x27;Ala&#x27;s invasion of Fars, had him replaced with Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas as governor. Umar then ordered Utbah ibn Ghazwan to send reinforcements to Khulayd. Once the reinforcements arrived, Khulayd and some of his men managed to withdraw to Bahrain, while the rest withdrew to Basra.

====Second and last Muslim invasion====
In , Uthman ibn Abi al-As seized Bishapur, which signed a peace treaty. In 644, al-&#x27;Ala&#x27; once again attacked Fars from Bahrain, reaching as far as Estakhr, until he was repulsed by the Persian governor (&quot;marzban&quot;) of Fars, Shahrag. Some time later, Uthman ibn Abi al-As managed to establish a military base at Tawwaj, and soon defeated and killed Shahrag near Rew-shahr. Persian convert to Islam, Hormoz ibn Hayyan al-&#x27;Abdi, was then sent by Uthman ibn Abi al-As to attack a fortress known as Senez on the coast of Fars. After the accession of Uthman ibn Affan as the new Rashidun Caliph on 11 November, the inhabitants of Bishapur, under the leadership of Shahrag&#x27;s brother, declared independence, but were defeated. The Persian historian al-Baladhuri said this occurred in 646.

In 648, &#x27;Abd-Allah ibn al-&#x27;Ash&#x27;ari forced the governor of Estakhr, Mahak, to surrender the city. Its citizens rebelled in 649/650 while its newly appointed governor, &#x27;Abd-Allah ibn &#x27;Amir, was trying to capture Gor. The military governor of Estakhr, &#x27;Ubayd Allah ibn Ma&#x27;mar, was defeated and killed. In 650/651, Yazdegerd went there to plan an organized resistance against the Arabs, and, after some time, went to Gor. Estakhr put up a weak resistance and was soon sacked by the Arabs, who killed over 40,000 defenders. The Arabs then quickly seized Gor, Kazerun and Siraf, while Yazdegerd fled to Kerman. Muslim control of Fars remained shaky for a time, with several local rebellions following the conquest.

===Conquest of Southeastern Persia (Kerman and Makran)===
The expedition to Kerman, under Suhail ibn Adi, was sent at roughly the same time as the expeditions to Sistan and Azerbaijan. Suhail marched from Busra in 643; passing through Shiraz and Persepolis, he joined with other armies and then marched against Kerman, which was subdued after a pitched battle with the local garrisons.

===Conquest of Sakastan===
The Arabs were raiding Sakastan as early as Umar&#x27;s caliphate. The first real invasion took place in 650, when Abd-Allah ibn Amir, having secured his position in Kerman, sent an army under Mujashi ibn Mas&#x27;ud there. After crossing the Dasht-i Lut desert, Mujashi ibn Mas&#x27;ud reached Sakastan, but suffered a heavy defeat and was forced to retreat.

One year later, Abd-Allah ibn Amir sent an army under Rabi ibn Ziyad Harithi to Sakastan. After some time, Rabi reached Zaliq, a Sakastani border town, where he forced the dehqan of the town to acknowledge Rashidun authority. He then did the same at the fortress of Karkuya, which had a famous fire temple mentioned in the Tarikh-i Sistan. He then seized more land in the province. Next, he besieged the provincial capital, Zrang, and, after a heavy battle outside the city, its governor, Aparviz, surrendered. When Aparviz went to Rabi ibn Ziyad to negotiate a treaty, he saw that Rabi was using the bodies of two dead soldiers as a chair. This horrified Aparviz, who, in order to spare the inhabitants of Sakastan from the Arabs, made peace with them in return for a heavy tribute of 1 million dirhams, including 1,000 slave boys (or girls) bearing 1,000 golden vessels. Rabi ibn Ziyad was then appointed governor of the province.

Eighteen months later, Rabi was summoned to Basra, and was replaced by &#x27;Abd al-Rahman ibn Samura. The inhabitants of Sakastan used this opportunity to rebel, defeating the Muslim garrison at Zrang. When &#x27;Abd al-Rahman ibn Samura reached Sakastan, he suppressed the rebellion and defeated the Zunbils of Zabulistan, seizing Bust and a few cities in Zabulistan.

===Conquest of Iranian Azerbaijan===
The conquest of Iranian Azerbaijan started in 651, part of a simultaneous attack launched against Kerman and Makran in the southeast (described above), against Sistan in the northeast and against Azerbaijan in the northwest. Hudheifa ibn Al Yaman was assigned Azerbaijan. Hudheifa marched from Rey in central Persia to Zanjan, a well-fortified Persian stronghold in the north. The Persians came out of the city and gave battle, but Hudheifa defeated them, captured the city, and those who sought peace were granted it on the usual &quot;jizya&quot; conditions. From Zanjan, Hudheifa marched to Ardabil which surrendered peacefully. Hudheifa then continued his march north along the western coast of the Caspian Sea and captured Bab al-Abwab by force. At this point Hudheifa was recalled by Uthman, to be replaced by Bukair ibn Abdullah and Utba ibn Farqad. They were sent to carry out a two-pronged attack against Azerbaijan: Bukair along the western coast of the Caspian Sea, and Uthba into the heart of Azerbaijan. On his way north Bukair was halted by a large Persian force under Isfandiyar, the son of Farrukhzad. A pitched battle was fought, after which Isfandiyar was defeated and captured. In return for his life, he agreed to surrender his estates in Azerbaijan and persuade others to submit to Muslim rule. Uthba ibn Farqad then defeated Bahram, brother of Isfandiyar. He too sued for peace. Azerbaijan then surrendered to Caliph Umar, agreeing to pay the annual &quot;jizya&quot;.

===Conquest of Armenia===

The Muslims had conquered Byzantine Armenia in 638–639. Armenia, remained in Persian hands, along with Khurasan. Umar refused to take any chances; he did not consider the Persians weak, which facilitated the speedy conquest of the Persian Empire. Again Umar sent simultaneous expeditions to the far north-east and north-west of the Persian Empire, one to Khurasan in late 643 and the other to Armenia.
Bukair ibn Abdullah was ordered to capture Tiflis. From Bab, on the western coast of the Caspian Sea, Bukair continued his march north. Umar employed his traditional successful strategy of multi-pronged attacks. While Bukair was still kilometres away from Tiflis, Umar instructed him to divide his army into three corps. Umar appointed Habib ibn Muslaima to capture Tiflis, Abdulrehman to march north against the mountains and Hudheifa to march against the southern mountains. With the success of all three missions, the advance into Armenia came to an end with the death of Umar in November 644. By then almost the whole of the South Caucasus was captured.

===Conquest of Khorasan===

Khorasan was the second-largest province of the Sasanian Empire. It stretched from what is now northeastern Iran, northwestern Afghanistan and southern Turkmenistan. In 651 the conquest of Khurasan was assigned to Ahnaf ibn Qais. Ahnaf marched from Kufa and took a short and less frequented route via Rey and Nishapur. Rey was already in Muslim hands and Nishapur surrendered without resistance. From Nishapur, Ahnaf marched to Herat in western Afghanistan. Herat was a fortified town, and the resulting siege lasted for a few months before it surrendered, bringing the whole of southern Khorasan under Muslim control. Ahnaf then marched north directly to Merv, in present-day Turkmenistan. Merv was the capital of Khurasan and here Yazdegred III held his court. On hearing of the Muslim advance, Yazdegerd III left for Balkh. No resistance was offered at Merv, and the Muslims occupied the capital of Khurasan without a fight. Ahnaf stayed at Merv and waited for reinforcement from Kufa. Meanwhile, Yazdegerd had also gathered considerable power at Balkh and allied with the Turkic Khan of Farghana, who personally led the relief contingent. Umar ordered Ahnaf to break up the alliance. The Khan of Farghana, realizing that fighting against the Muslims might endanger his own kingdom, withdrew from the alliance and pulled back to Farghana. The remainder of Yazdegerd&#x27;s army was defeated at the Battle of Oxus River and retreated across the Oxus to Transoxiana. Yazdegerd himself narrowly escaped to China.The Muslims had now reached the outermost frontiers of Persia. Beyond that lay the lands of the Turks and still further lay China. Ahnaf returned to Merv and sent a detailed report of his success to the anxiously waiting Umar, and sought permission to cross the Oxus river and invade Transoxiana. Umar ordered Ahnaf to stand down and instead consolidate his power south of the Oxus.

==Persian rebellion and reconquest==
Umar was assassinated in November 644 by a Persian slave named Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a Firuz, after having refused to lift a tax imposed upon the latter. Soon after, Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a&#x27;s was either executed or committed suicide. In retaliation, Ubayd Allah ibn Umar (one of Umar&#x27;s sons) killed Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a&#x27;s daughter, and declared his intention to kill all non-Arabs residing in Medina. Acting upon a claim that they had been seen conspiring with Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a while he was holding the murder weapon, Ubayd Allah killed Hurmuzān, an ex-Sasanian military officer who had been working for Umar as an adviser after his capture by the Muslims, and Jufayna, a Christian man from the city of Al-Hira in Iraq who had been taken to Medina to serve as a tutor. Just like Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a&#x27;s assassination of Umar over something as trivial as a tax burden, Ubayd Allah&#x27;s retaliatory killing of apparently random non-Arabs bears witness to the strong tensions that existed between Arabs and non-Arabs in the early Islamic caliphate.

Uthman ibn Affan (644–656) succeeded Umar as caliph. During his reign, almost the whole of the former Sassanid empire&#x27;s territory rebelled from time to time, requiring him to send several military expeditions to crush the rebellions and recapture Persia and its vassal states. The main rebellions were in the Persian provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Fars, Sistan (in 649), Khorasan (651), and Makran (650). Finally, in 651, Yazdegerd III, the last Sassanid emperor, was killed near Merv by a local miller for his purse, thus putting an end to both his dynasty and to organized Persian resistance. Meanwhile, Uthman&#x27;s empire expanded beyond the borders of the Sasanian Empire, to Transoxiana, Baluchistan, and the Caucasus. For many decades to come, this was the easternmost limit of Muslim rule.

==Persia under Muslim rule==

According to Bernard Lewis:

Arab Muslims conquests have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders. Both perceptions are of course valid, depending on one&#x27;s angle of vision. Iran was Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna.

===Administration===
Under Umar and his immediate successors, the Arab conquerors attempted to maintain their political and cultural cohesion despite the attractions of the civilizations they had conquered. The Arabs initially settled in the garrison towns rather than on scattered estates.

The new non-Muslim subjects were protected by the state and known as &quot;dhimmi&quot; (&quot;protected&quot;), and were to pay a special tax, the jizya (&quot;tribute&quot;), which was calculated at varying individual rates, usually two dirhams for able-bodied men of military age, in return for exemption from military service. Women and children were exempted from the jizya.
Mass conversions were neither desired nor allowed, at least in the first few centuries of Arab rule.

Umar is reported to have issued the following instructions about the protected people: &quot;Make it easy for him, who can not pay tribute; help him who is weak, let them keep their titles, but do not give them our kuniyat [&quot;Arabic traditional nicknames or titles&quot;].&quot;
Umar&#x27;s liberal policies were continued by at least his immediate successors. In his dying charge to Uthman, he is reported to have said, &quot;I charge the caliph after me to be kind to the dhimmis, to keep their covenant, to protect them and not to burden them over their strength.&quot;
As a matter of practicality, the jizya replaced the Sasanian poll taxes, which tended to be much higher than the jizya. In addition to the jizya, the old Sasanian &quot;land tax&quot; (known in Arabic as &quot;Kharaj&quot;) was also adopted. Umar is said to have occasionally set up commissions to survey tax burdens in order to ensure that they wouldn&#x27;t be more than the land could bear. It is reported that Zoroastrians were subjected to humiliation and ridicule when paying the jizya in order to make them feel inferior.

At least under the Rashiduns and early Umayyads, the administrative system of the late Sasanian period was largely retained: a pyramidal system where each quarter of the state was divided into provinces, the provinces into districts, and the districts into sub-districts. Provinces were called &quot;ustan&quot; (Middle Persian &quot;ostan&quot;), and the districts &quot;shahrs&quot;, centered upon a district capital known as a &quot;shahristan&quot;. The subdistricts were called &quot;tasok&quot; in Middle Persian, which was adopted into Arabic as &quot;tassuj&quot; (plural &quot;tasasij&quot;).

===Religion===
Zoroastrians were made to pay an extra tax called jizya, or be killed, enslaved or imprisoned. Those paying jizya were subjected to insults and humiliation by the tax collectors. Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted to Islam. While giving freedom of choice, the Arab conquerors designated privileges for those who converted to Islam. The conversion process was slow and uncompleted, stretching over many centuries, with a majority of Persians still following Zoroastrianism at the turn of the millennium.

Muslim leaders in their effort to win converts encouraged attendance at Muslim prayer with promises of money and allowed the Quran to be recited in Persian instead of Arabic so that it would be intelligible to all. Islam was readily accepted by Zoroastrians who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure. Moreover, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, the Persian would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis. In Afghanistan, Islam was spread due to Umayyad missionary efforts particularly under the reigns of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik and Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz.

There were also large and thriving Christian and Jewish communities, along with smaller numbers of Buddhists and other groups. The population moved slowly and steadily toward Islam. The nobility and citizens converted first. Islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the &quot;dihqans&quot;, or landed gentry. By the late 10th century, the majority of the Persians had become Muslim.

Until the 15th century, most Persian Muslims were Sunni Muslims of the Shafi&#x27;i and Hanafi legal schools, with the rise of the Safavids in the early 16th century and their forced conversion of Sunnis, Shi&#x27;a Islam came to dominate the land.

==Language of Persia==
During the Rashidun Caliphate, the official language of Persia (including Mesopotamia) remained Middle Persian (Pahlavi), just as the official languages of Syria and Egypt remained Greek, both languages came to the region through the conquering Greek Macedonian and Persian Achaemenid empires. During the Umayyad Caliphate, the Umayyads made Arabic the primary language of their subjected people throughout their empire. Particularly, Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (661–714) officially changed the administrative language of Iraq from Middle Persian (Pahlavi) to Arabic, this was the first since the Neo-Babylonian Empire that a Semitic language was reinstated as an official language in Mesopotamia (Iraq). Arabic mainly supplanted other Afro-Asiatic sister languages, like Coptic in Egypt and Berber and Punic in the Maghreb region (Berber is still spoken and official in Algeria and Morocco), but the more distant Indo-European languages like Middle Persian and Kurdish proved to be more enduring. Most of Middle Persian structure and vocabulary survived, evolving into New Persian. Persian incorporated a certain amount of Arabic vocabulary, especially words pertaining to religion (and later to science and arts), and it switched from the Pahlavi scripts to a modified version of the Arabic alphabet. Today Persian is spoken officially in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.

==Urbanisation==
The Arab conquest of Persia led to a period of extreme urbanisation in Iran, starting with the ascension of the Abbasid dynasty and ending in the 11th century CE. This was particularly true for the eastern parts of the country, for regions like Khorasan and Transoxiana. During this period, Iran saw the development of massive metropolises, some reaching population numbers of up to 200,000 people. This period of extreme urbanisation was followed in the late 11th and early 12th century by a collapse of the Iranian economy, which led to large scale emigrations of Iranians into Central Asia, India, the rest of the Middle East, and Anatolia. This catastrophe has been cited by some as reason for the Persian language becoming widespread throughout Central Asia and large parts of the Middle East.

<doc id="1275750" wikidata="Q933408" url="?curid=1275750" title="Induced coma">
<text>An induced comaalso known as a medically induced coma (MIC), barbiturate-induced coma, or drug-induced comais a temporary coma (a deep state of unconsciousness) brought on by a controlled dose of an anesthetic drug, often a barbiturate such as pentobarbital or thiopental. Other intravenous anesthetic drugs such as midazolam or propofol may be used.

Drug-induced comas are used to protect the brain during major neurosurgery, as a last line of treatment in certain cases of status epilepticus that have not responded to other treatments, and in refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury.

Induced coma usually results in significant systemic adverse effects. The patient is likely to completely lose respiratory drive and require mechanical ventilation; gut motility is reduced; hypotension can complicate efforts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure and often requires the use of vasopressor drugs. Hypokalemia often results. The completely immobile patient is at increased risk of bed sores as well as infection from catheters.

The presence of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation alone are not indications of continuous sedation and coma. Only certain conditions such as intracranial hypertension, refractory status epilepticus, the inability to oxygenate with movement, et cetera justify the high risks of medically induced comas.

Brain disruption from sedation can lead to an eight times increased risk of the development of ICU delirium. This is associated with a doubled risk of mortality during hospital admission. For every one day of delirium, there is a 10% increased risk of death. Medically induced comas that achieve a RASS level of −4 or −5 are an independent predictor of death.  

Although patients are not sleeping while sedated, they can experience hallucinations and delusions that are often graphic and traumatizing in nature. This can lead to post-ICU PTSD after hospital discharge. Patients that develop ICU delirium are at 120 times greater risk of long-term cognitive impairments.

Considering the high risks of medically induced comas, protocols such as the ABCDEF Bundle and PADIS guidelines have been developed to guide ICU teams to avoid unnecessary sedation and comas. ICU teams that master these protocols to keep patients as awake and mobile as possible are called &quot;Awake and Walking ICUs&quot;. These are teams that only implement medically induced comas when the possible benefits of sedation outweigh the high risks during specific cases. 

Survivors of prolonged medically induced comas are at high risk of suffering from post-ICU syndrome and may require extended physical, cognitive, and psychological rehabilitation.

== Theory ==
Barbiturates reduce the metabolic rate of brain tissue, as well as the cerebral blood flow. With these reductions, the blood vessels in the brain narrow, resulting in a shrunken brain, and hence lower intracranial pressure. The hope is that, with the swelling relieved, the pressure decreases and some or all brain damage may be averted. Several studies have supported this theory by showing reduced mortality when treating refractory intracranial hypertension with a barbiturate coma.

About 60% of the glucose and oxygen used by the brain is meant for its electrical activity and the rest for all other activities such as metabolism. When barbiturates are given to brain injured patients for induced coma, they act by reducing the electrical activity of the brain, which reduces the metabolic and oxygen demand. Their action limits oxidative damage to lipid membranes and may scavenge free radicals. They also lead to reduced vasogenic edema, fatty acid release and intracellular calcium release.

The infusion dose rate of barbiturates is increased under monitoring by electroencephalography until burst suppression or cortical electrical silence (isoelectric &quot;flatline&quot;) is attained. Once there is improvement in the patient&#x27;s general condition, the barbiturates are withdrawn gradually and the patient regains consciousness.

Controversy exists over the benefits of using barbiturates to control intracranial hypertension. Some studies have found that barbiturate-induced coma can reduce intracranial hypertension but does not necessarily prevent brain damage. Furthermore, the reduction in intracranial hypertension may not be sustained. Some randomized trials have failed to demonstrate any survival or morbidity benefit of induced coma in diverse conditions such as neurosurgical operations, head trauma, intracranial aneurysm rupture, intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and status epilepticus. If the patient survives, cognitive impairment may also follow recovery from the coma. Due to these risks, barbiturate-induced coma should be reserved for cases of refractory intracranial pressure elevation.

<text>Pakil, officially the Municipality of Pakil (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 23,495 people.

==History==

=== Spanish colonial period ===

When the Spanish conquistadors together with the Augustinians stationed at Bay came to the place in 1571, this colony was under the leadership of Gat Paquil whose name was used to name the settlement as &quot;Paquil&quot;, which remained during the whole Spanish Regime and early part of the American period.

When the Franciscan missionaries came in 1578, Pakil was attached to Paete in 1602 as its &quot;visita&quot;. Padre Francisco Barajas, made efforts to separate this town from Paete, and Don Diego Jorge became the first Capitan Municipal or Gobernadorcillo on May 12, 1676. Pakil was named as an independent town with the administration of the &quot;Capitan Municipal&quot; at the helm of the local colonial government, the last of whom was Capitan Municipal Don Nicolas Regalado.

=== American colonial period ===

With the change of government from the Spanish to Philippine, and eventually American after the total occupation of the Philippines by the United States after the defeat of the Philippine Republican Army in the Philippine–American War of 1898–1900, the Americans had to reorganize the pattern of the Civil Government in the country in 1901. It was Bernardo Gonzales was appointed the first &quot;Presidente Municipal&quot; (Municipal President) during the American Period until November 25, 1903. Upon the reorganization, the Public Law No. 1009, of the Philippine Commission, the town of Pakil was merged with Pangil in order to reduce the number of existing towns where the smaller towns are merged with more secure towns to stabilize the local economy due to the damages of the previous war. After nineteen years, On October 1, 1927, by virtue of Executive Order No. 77, Pakil was re-established as a municipality, with its spelling changed from Paquil to Pakil.

===World War II and Japanese occupation===

The invasion of the Philippines started on 8 December 1941, ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. At Pearl Harbor, American aircraft were severely damaged in the initial Japanese attack. Lacking air cover, the American Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines withdrew to Java on 12 December 1941. General Douglas MacArthur was ordered out, leaving his men at Corregidor on the night of 11 March 1942 for Australia, away. The 76,000 starving and sick American and Filipino defenders in Bataan surrendered on 9 April 1942, and were forced to endure the infamous Bataan Death March on which 7,000–10,000 died or were murdered. The 13,000 survivors on Corregidor surrendered on 6 May.

Japan occupied the Philippines for over three years, until their surrender in 1945. A highly effective guerilla campaign by Philippine resistance forces controlled sixty percent of the islands, mostly in the jungle and mountain areas. MacArthur supplied them by submarine, and sent reinforcements and officers. Filipinos remained loyal to the United States, partly because of the American guarantee of independence, and also because the Japanese had pressed large numbers of Filipinos into work details and even put young Filipino women into brothels.

General MacArthur kept his promise to return to the Philippines on 20 October 1944. The landings on the island of Leyte were accompanied by a force of 700 vessels and 174,000 men. Through December 1944, the islands of Leyte and Mindoro were cleared of Japanese soldiers. During the campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army conducted a suicidal defense of the islands. Cities such as Manila were reduced to rubble. Around 500,000 Filipinos died during the Japanese occupation period.

In 1942, the Japanese troops occupied in Pakil, Laguna and in 1945, Pakil was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces after the Philippine Army and Philippine Constabulary entered the town along with the local recognized guerrillas against the Japanese forces during the Second World War.

=== Modern era ===
In 1954, the sitios known as Casa Real, Casinsin and Kabulusan were converted into barrios. Durado followed suit in 1957.

==Geography==
Pakil&#x27;s land area consists of two non-contiguous parts, separated by Laguna de Bay. It borders Mabitac to the north, Pangil to the west, and Paete to the south. Pakil is from Santa Cruz, from Manila, and from Lucena.

===Barangays===
Pakil is politically subdivided into 13 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

== Economy ==
==Culture==
Music was formally initiated in the town of Pakil by San Pedro Bautista (1586) the Guardian of the Franciscan order. He established the only Music Academy in the country. The school started with 400 children from towns along the Laguna Bay.
These students started as church choir members and were taught how to make musical instruments out of locally available materials like bamboo, cans, wood and coconut shells. These kids were called “Tiple” and they trained other younger children to become members of the church choir.

The entire population became involved in teaching their youth to sing and play instruments. This tradition was handed down from generation to generation. The Adonay family influenced the spread of musical interest and helped form the first brass band in Pakil.

The elderly Tacio Celis helped train children to read musical notes and play instruments. Since then, many young musicians finished college on scholarships by playing for their school bands.

Currently Pakil Music Program is helping out young students to continue the rich musical heritage of the town. Pakil Music Program (PMP) is providing music education through note reading and instrument performances with the help of some retired musicians. The current executive director of the PMP is Mr. Roy Regalado.

==Religion==
===St. Peter of Alcantara Parish===

The St. Peter of Alcantara Parish, also the Diocesan Shrine of the Our Lady of Turumba is a Roman Catholic Church in Pakil and home to the Our Lady of Sorrows de Turumba.

=== Our Lady of Turumba ===
Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de Turumba (&quot;Our Lady of Sorrows of Turumba&quot;) is the name for a specific statue of the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Sorrows, enshrined in Pakil.

===Liceo de Pakil===

Liceo de Pakil is a private sectarian Catholic high school originally established by the Maryknoll Fathers in 1956. At first, the school was named Maryknoll Fathers High School following the namesake of its leaders. When the Maryknoll Fathers had to go to their mission in Davao, they ceded the leadership to the Maryknoll Sisters who subsequently changed the school&#x27;s name into Maryknoll High School. Upon the termination of the mission of the Maryknoll Sisters in 1972, Bishop Pedro N. Bantigue invited the Augustinian Recollect Sisters to administer the school. The name was changed again to Mary Immaculate Academy by the Augustinian Recollect Sisters. In 1982, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Liceo De Pakil by the Diocese of San Pablo. The first batch to graduate under Liceo de Pakil was the batch of 1983 graduating class. In 1986, the administration of the school was passed on to the Missionary Catechists of St. Therese (MCST). Liceo De Pakil is currently under the administration of the MCST and the Diocese of San Pablo.

<text>Shiprock (, &quot;rock with wings&quot; or &quot;winged rock&quot;) is a monadnock rising nearly above the high-desert plain of the Navajo Nation in San Juan County, New Mexico, United States. Its peak elevation is above sea level. It is southwest of the town of Shiprock, which is named for the peak.

Governed by the Navajo Nation, the formation is in the Four Corners region and plays a significant role in Navajo religion, myth, and tradition. Shiprock is a point of interest for rock climbers and photographers and has been featured in several film productions and novels. It is the most prominent landmark in northwestern New Mexico. In 1975, Shiprock was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

==Name==
The Navajo name for the peak, , &quot;rock with wings&quot; or &quot;winged rock&quot;, refers to the legend of the great bird that brought the Navajo from the north to their present lands. The name &quot;Shiprock&quot; or Shiprock Peak or Ship Rock derives from the peak&#x27;s resemblance to an enormous 19th-century clipper ship. Americans first called the peak &quot;The Needle&quot;, a name given to the topmost pinnacle by Captain J. F. McComb in 1860. United States Geological Survey maps indicate that the name &quot;Ship Rock&quot; dates from the 1870s.

==Geology==
Shiprock, an example of a volcanic neck, is composed of fractured volcanic breccia and black dikes of igneous rock called minette, a type of lamprophyre. It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano, and the volcanic breccia formed in a diatreme. The rock probably was originally formed 2,500–3,000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth&#x27;s surface, but it was exposed after millions of years of erosion. Wall-like sheets of minette, known as dikes, radiate away from the central formation. Radiometric age determinations of the minette establish that these volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo volcanic field—a field that includes intrusions and flows of minette and other unusual igneous rocks that formed about 30 million years ago. Agathla (El Capitan) in Monument Valley is another prominent volcanic neck in this volcanic field.
==Climbing history and legal status==
The recorded first ascent was in 1939, by a Sierra Club party including David Brower, Raffi Bedayn, Bestor Robinson and John Dyer. This was the first climb in the United States to use expansion bolts for protection. Pitons were used for direct aid. This first ascent route is featured in the 1979 book &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot;.

Since then at least seven routes have been climbed on the peak, all of them of great technical difficulty. A modification of the original route is recorded as the easiest, and it is rated as Grade IV, YDS 5.9, A1. It was considered a great unsolved problem by the climbing community in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time there was a widespread rumor of a $1000 prize for climbing the peak, which inspired &quot;dozens of attempts by the experienced and inexperienced alike&quot;.

The idea of climbing Shiprock is repugnant to many Navajo people. Climbing has been illegal since 1970. In spite of this, rock climbers continue to see Shiprock as an interesting place to climb.

Serious injuries to three climbers in March 1970 caused the Navajo Nation to ban rock climbing not only on Shiprock but all over the Navajo Nation on monoliths, spires and within tribal parks under the jurisdiction of Navajo Parks &amp; Recreation. The Navajo Nation announced that the ban was &quot;absolute, final and unconditional&quot;.

According to reports from the Navajo Parks and Recreation Department, which administers recreational activities on Navajo land, there have been false claims that the department allows rock climbing and cooperates with rock climbing organizations. A 2006 press release addressing Monument Valley, another area of monoliths within the Navajo Nation, states:


Permits are issued by the department to camp and hike in some areas, but not for sacred monuments such as Shiprock.

==Religious and cultural significance==
Shiprock and the surrounding land have religious and historical significance to the Navajo people. It is mentioned in many of their myths and legends. Foremost is the peak&#x27;s role as the agent that brought the Navajo to the southwest. According to one legend, after being transported from another place, the Navajos lived on the monolith, &quot;coming down only to plant their fields and get water.&quot; One day, the peak was struck by lightning, obliterating the trail and leaving only a sheer cliff, and stranding the women and children on top to starve. The presence of people on the peak is forbidden &quot;for fear they might stir up the (ghosts), or rob their corpses.&quot;

Navajo legend puts the peak in a larger geographic context. Shiprock is said to be either a medicine pouch or a bow carried by the &quot;Goods of Value Mountain&quot;, a large mythic male figure comprising several mountain features throughout the region. The Chuska Mountains comprise the body, Chuska Peak is the head, the Carrizo Mountains are the legs, and Beautiful Mountain is the feet.

Navajo legend has it that Bird Monsters () nested on the peak and fed on human flesh. After Monster Slayer, elder of the Warrior Twins, destroyed at Red Mesa, he killed two adult Bird Monsters at Shiprock and changed two young ones into an eagle and an owl. The peak is mentioned in stories from the Enemy Side Ceremony and the Navajo Mountain Chant, and is associated with the Bead Chant and the Naayee&#x27;ee Ceremony.

Notes:

# On this occasion, two executions took place.
# On this occasion, three executions took place.
# This is what the chart claimed in 2005, but contrary to popular belief, Adonijah Bailey was not the oldest person executed at age 79 in 1824; instead, he was tried and sentenced to death at age 80 in January 1825 for the murder of Jeremiah W. Pollock, and hanged himself on May 24, over 2 weeks before he was to be executed. The title of the oldest person executed goes instead to Gershon Marx, hanged on May 18, 1905, for murder at age 73.

<doc id="1275764" wikidata="Q3078005" url="?curid=1275764" title="Fort Rouge (electoral district)">
<text>Fort Rouge () is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1957, and formally came into existence in the general election of 1958. The riding was eliminated in 1989, and re-established in 1999. It is located in the central section of the City of Winnipeg.

Fort Rouge is bordered on the east by St. Boniface, to the south by Fort Garry-Riverview, to the north by Logan, and to the west by River Heights. The actual Legislative Assembly of Manitoba building is located across the river from Fort Rouge.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,364. In 1999, the average family income was $49,361, and the unemployment rate was 8.70%. 39.6% of Fort Rouge&#x27;s residents are listed as low-income, the sixth-highest rate in the province. Almost 80% of occupied dwelling are rentals, and over 20% of households are single-parent families. Almost 25% of Fort Rouge&#x27;s residents have a university degree—one of the highest rates in the province.

Fort Rouge has an immigrant population of 20%. Eight per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are aboriginal. The service sector accounts for 21% of Fort Rouge&#x27;s industry, with a further 11% in social services.

The seat was held by the Progressive Conservatives from 1958 to 1973, and was a rare bastion of Liberal strength in the province from 1973 to 1981. Lloyd Axworthy was the riding&#x27;s representative from 1973 to 1979; for a time, he was the only Liberal in the legislature. Roland Penner&#x27;s election for the New Democratic Party in 1981, however, foretold of future NDP successes in the riding. Though Jim Carr would win the riding back for the Liberals in 1988, the seat would be broken into Crescentwood, Broadway and Osborne for the 1990 election. By the time the seat was reestablished in 1999, Crescentwood, Broadway and Osborne would all have NDP representatives, with Crescentwood MLA Tim Sale becoming the first MLA of the reestablished Fort Rouge. It has been continuously represented by the NDP since the riding was reestablished in 1999.

In the 2007, 2011 and 2016 provincial elections the Liberals were the main challengers to the NDP, though the party would continue to hold the seat with Jennifer Howard. In 2016, Liberal leader Rana Bokhari ran in Fort Rouge, losing to the NDP star candidate Wab Kinew. At the 2015 federal election, according to Elections Canada data, Fort Rouge voted heavily Liberal. In the 2019 and 2023 elections, the Progressive Conservatives finished second behind the NDP, with the Liberals falling behind Green candidate James Beddome in 2019.

The district is represented by NDP leader and Premier Wab Kinew.

<text>The Bught ( ; ) is an area of the Scottish city of Inverness. A &quot;bught&quot; is defined in the Dictionary of the Scots Language as follows &quot;Bowcht, Bucht, n. Also: boucht; bowght, bought. [Flem. bocht, bucht, inclosure for swine, sheep, etc.] A sheep-fold; a milking fold for ewes.&quot;

It is situated between the River Ness and the Caledonian Canal in the west of the city. It is a recreational area and contains the sports ground Bught Park, Inverness Sports Centre &amp; Aquadome, Inverness Ice Rink, Whin Park and the Ness Islands. There is also a caravan park and extensive playing fields in the area.

The sports fields are used as the home grounds for Inverness Blitz American football home games.

Due to the recreational nature of the area, there is very little housing and most people live in the nearby areas of Dalneigh and Ballifeary.

<doc id="1275771" wikidata="Q1669902" url="?curid=1275771" title="M. A. Foster">
<text>Michael Anthony Foster (July 2, 1939 – November 14, 2020) was an American science fiction writer from Greensboro, North Carolina. He spent over sixteen years as a captain and Russian linguist in the United States Air Force.

==&quot;Ler&quot; books==
Foster wrote a loosely connected trilogy about an offshoot of humanity called the Ler: &quot;The Warriors of Dawn &quot;(1975), &quot;The Gameplayers of Zan &quot;(1977), and &quot;The Day of The Klesh &quot;(1979). &quot;The Gameplayers of Zan&quot; takes place much earlier than the others, on Earth, and details the Ler&#x27;s departure from Earth; the other two books cover two separate human-Ler encounters on other planets. The &quot;game&quot; from the title of &quot;The Gameplayers of Zan&quot; is based on cellular automata, a more intricate version of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life.

&quot;The Warriors of Dawn&quot; mostly concerns the relationship between a human man and a ler woman, and &quot;The Day of The Klesh&quot; represents the ler as a mostly inscrutable humanoid race. &quot;The Gameplayers of Zan&quot;, on the other hand, discusses the origins of the Ler as an engineered offshoot of humanity, and is as much about ler culture as their interactions with humanity. Most of the action in this book takes place in Unwharrie National Forest, North Carolina.

Ler reproduce infrequently, only becoming fertile at age thirty after a long adolescence: they experience two fertility periods, five years apart. Hence most ler females have only two children, but occasionally they have a third, and twins are not unknown.

Ler family structure is organized around a &quot;braid,&quot; which they have designed to preserve maximum genetic diversity to offset their low initial population and small birth rate. A braid starts with two &quot;fore-parents&quot;. They mate and produce the &quot;elder outsibling&quot;. Then each of the fore-parents goes forth and brings back another ler of the appropriate gender, the &quot;after-parents&quot;. The fore-parents each mate with an after-parent and produce the &quot;insiblings&quot;, five years younger than the elder outsibling. Then the after-parents mate and produce the &quot;younger outsibling&quot;, five years younger than the insiblings. The insiblings remain in the braid and become the fore-parents to the next generation; the outsiblings will leave to join other braids as after-parents. The rare surplus children tend to be given the responsibility of beginning completely new braids together. Alternation in the gender of children is enforced with pheromones. In rare cases, sometimes on purpose, two same-sex insiblings are born; the braid line ends there, as all four children must weave into other braids as after-parents.

Ler communicate mainly using a verbal language called Singlespeech. Each ler has a name consisting of three syllables, e.g. &quot;Maellenkleth&quot;, though their intimates sometimes use shortened versions of the name. Various categories of objects always have names with the same numbers of syllables, e.g. stars have four-syllable names. As in the Chinese language, each Singlespeech syllable has four possible meanings, but unlike Chinese, Singlespeech is not a tonal language. Instead, each Singlespeech word has four &quot;modes&quot; corresponding to the four classical Greek elements (Earth, Air, Fire, Water), with each mode having a symbolic meaning borrowed from the Divinatory tarot, and complex grammatical rules govern the allowed transitions from mode to mode. The meanings of Singlespeech words are therefore highly context-dependent, and careful attention must be paid to mode transitions during a conversation.

Elemental symbolism extends also to the meanings of ler personal names, but each individual keeps their &quot;governing element&quot; a secret; this latter custom complicates ler marriage negotiations, since each foreparent must choose the other foreparents&#x27; second (afterparent) mate, and the governing elements of each foreparent/afterparent mating must be complementary: Earth with Air, and Fire with Water.

There is also a less frequently used mode of communication called Multispeech, which uses all the available communication channels, verbal and nonverbal, to convey information in a much more detailed fashion than Singlespeech ever could.

After the completion of the Ler trilogy, Foster continued to work on the development and explication of Singlespeech, which he renamed Layaklan (which name back-translates to &#x27;Understanding&#x27; in English). A substantial Layaklan-to-English lexicon and an outline of a corresponding English-to-Layaklan lexicon (both of which were written by Foster), accompanied by supporting articles concerning Layaklan, were available online but were subsequently lost.

==The Morphodite Trilogy==
This series consists of: &quot;The Morphodite&quot; (1981), &quot;Transformer&quot; (1983), and &quot;Preserver&quot; (1985). The title character is a reluctant assassin who can change forms, invariably alternating sex and decreasing in age as he/she does so. The stories themselves are centered on either a different planet or in space, with short segues that lead the reader from place to place.

In &quot;The Morphodite&quot;, we discover the initial character, Rael, as a fearsome assassin who has never been unleashed upon the world. He (as he/she then is) is caged in &quot;The Mask Factory&quot;, and his captors fear him much more than any of their other creations. Rael is not a bioengineered assassin: he/she instead initiates Change through a form of meditation. The process of Change is similar to a small death without the &quot;ever after&quot; aspects of it, and is quite painful—not something Rael does lightly. Additionally, Change involves a forced decrease in age of 10 to 20 years, limiting the number of Changes possible in a short period of time. We discover why Rael is so feared shortly after &quot;his&quot; introduction--&quot;he&quot; has evolved a scientific method of predicting or divining the future. Most particularly, this art can identify the single person whose death would precipitate a societal change. That art is elaborated in &quot;Transformer&quot;, but in brief it is likened to a version of the &quot;I Ching&quot; that is both scientifically rigorous and orders of magnitude more complex. This divination tool is referred to as &quot;the art&quot; through the books. &quot;The Morphodite&quot; depicts Rael&#x27;s unleashing on the unchanging world of Oerlikon and the changes he/she thereby unleashes upon it.

Oerlikon is an out-of-the way world that has gathered a group of people who desire to suppress change. In order to do so, they have a highly regimented society and the equivalent of a police state. This unchanging state is artificially enabled by an outside party that has stationed researchers throughout Oerlikon. Rael changes Oelikon by killing one of the observers using his/her assassin skills and his divination art. As the first domino begins to tumble, the observed suddenly become aware of the observers, and interrogations of captured observers lead society into a spiral of self-destruction. Rael then initiates Change and becomes Damistofina, a younger, female version of his then-current self. But Damistofina is eventually identified as the Morphodite and pursued, leading her to kill her pursuer and Change yet again, this time to Phaedrus, a yet-younger male. Eventually the upheaval grinds to a halt and Phaedrus gathers small groups of refugees to himself, becoming a sort of mind-healer. He does not go on to be king or gain immense power; instead, he is at peace.

In &quot;The Transformer&quot;, we resume where Phaedrus left off, content with his life, a few adopted children and a gather-woman. He is recognized as an adviser to the local ruler because of his efforts at providing peace. Unfortunately, there is more to the researchers than we originally supposed. Before Phaedrus was Rael, he was a woman named Jedily Tulily. Jedily was originally an observer who somehow displeased the Regents of Heliarctos and was dumped into The Mask Factory to be used up as a test subject. Upon discovering that Phaedrus still exists, they dispatch assassins to destroy him. Through a convenient quirk of fate, Phaedrus is summoned to the local ruler when the attempt occurs. His lover and adopted children are not so lucky. Initiating Change again, Phaedrus becomes Nazarine, a young woman who is barely out of her teens. Nazarine realizes both that she cannot Change again without becoming an infant and that the Regents (unknown to her at this point) won&#x27;t stop trying to kill her.

Following back through her past, she recovers some of the documents from The Mask Factory that lets her determine that Jedily was an off-world observer. After making that connection, Nazarine travels to the only spaceport, intent on traveling off-planet. She purchases a ticket on a ship while the Regents&#x27; assassins follow closely behind. One of her companions is killed by an assassin but gives up her new name in the process. Faren Kiricky, a ship tech, and Dorje, a ship security officer, befriend Nazarine and help her to identify the assassins. After using her art of divination, Nazarine confronts the data processor of the assassin pair and convinces her that Nazarine already knows how to win. In despair, the data processor commits suicide. The killer of the assassin pair evades capture by entering the bowels of the ship. Nazarine and Faren track and finally confront him. Nazarine tells him that no matter what he does, his actions will actually destroy the Regents - and then she lets him go. Nazarine discloses what she is to Faren and asks Faren to take care of her. Faren agrees, and Nazarine initiates Change resulting in a male infant.

Led by a Chief Review Officer - the department&#x27;s chief executive - the Office has approximately 150 designated review officers located in five regions. These regions are: Northern, Waikato/Bay of Plenty, Central, Southern, and Te Uepū ā-Motu (ERO&#x27;s Māori review services unit).

The Education Review Office and the Ministry of Education are two separate public service departments. The functions and powers of the office are set out in Part 28 (sections 323–328) of the Education Act 1989.

In May 2023, the Independent Children&#x27;s Monitor was transferred from the Ministry of Social Development, and reconstituted as a departmental agency of the Education Review Office. The Children&#x27;s Monitor oversees the entire Oranga Tamariki (Ministry for Children) system. 

==Mandate and responsibilities==
ERO reviews the education provided for school students in all state schools, private schools and kura kaupapa Māori. It also reviews the education and care provided for children in early childhood education services and kōhanga reo. Reviews are carried out every three years on average, but are more frequent where the performance of a school or service is below standard or there are risks to the education or safety of the students or children. The department also checks that schools are meeting necessary legal requirements. Occasionally, special reviews of individual schools are ordered outside of the normal review cycle, which focus on specific areas of concern with a school&#x27;s management.

ERO reports to individual boards of trustees on what they are doing well and where they need to improve. In some cases of poor performance or major risks to students, the department may recommend to the Minister and Secretary of Education some form of intervention to the school&#x27;s management. Reports on individual schools and early childhood services are freely available to the public via ERO&#x27;s website.

These reviews may take place in Māori-medium, English-medium and Pacific-medium contexts, and additionally has the ability to undertake reviews of private and independent schools, homeschooling, schools and kura with international students, school hostels, and new and merging schools’ readiness to open.

The majority of reviews undertaken by the ERO are initiated by Chief Review Officer, however the Minister of Education does also have the ability to request reviews of specific aspects of the education sector under the ERO&#x27;s remits. The ERO does not hold its own policy mandate, instead fulfilling more of a research and evaluation function but does support relevant policy development based on its operational insights.

==History==
In late October 2024, ERO released truancy figures confirming that over 80,000 students were absent from school for more than three weeks during Term 2 of the 2024 school year. The department recommended that the Ministry of Education shift its focus from its Early Attendance Service programmes to preventing children from missing out from schools.

<doc id="1275796" wikidata="Q60786966" url="?curid=1275796" title="Shorebirds (band)">
<text>Shorebirds were a short-lived punk rock band from Olympia, Washington, formed in 2007 by Mattie Jo Canino, Chris Bauermeister and Keith Henderson.

== History ==
The band was formed in 2007 following the breakup of Latterman and Mattie Jo Canino&#x27;s relocation to Olympia, Washington. Canino connected with Bauermeister, having moved to Olympia following the demise of Jawbreaker in the late 90s and Keith Henderson, a local drummer. Together they released a self-titled 7&quot; inch and a split with Something&#x27;s Wrong in 2007. The following year they released their only full length, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Get Ugly&quot; via Rumbletowne Records before quietly disbanding at the end of 2008.

Canino and Bauermeister would go on to play in the short lived Mutoid Men together (not to be confused with Mutoid Man). Canino would then go on to form the acclaimed RVIVR in 2011 with Bauermeister rejoining temporarily in 2014 to record bass on their &quot;Bicker &amp; Breathe&quot; EP. Bauermeister would eventually go on to rejoin Jawbreaker in 2017 with a highly successful reunion at Chicago&#x27;s Riot Fest.

<doc id="1275800" wikidata="Q2753015" url="?curid=1275800" title="North-Eastern Rhodesia">
<text>North-Eastern Rhodesia was a British protectorate in south central Africa formed in 1900. The protectorate was administered under charter by the British South Africa Company. It was one of what were colloquially referred to as the &quot;three Rhodesian protectorates&quot;, the other two being Southern Rhodesia and Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia. It was amalgamated with Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia, another territory administered by the British South Africa Company, to form Northern Rhodesia in 1911.

==History==
The colonisation of the region that would become North-Eastern Rhodesia began in 1890. Joseph Thompson was dispatched by Cecil Rhodes of the British South Africa Company to negotiate agreements with African chiefs. Alfred Sharpe was similarly dispatched by the British Consul for Nyasaland for the same purpose. After failing to secure any agreements, Sharpe and Thompson used force to subdue the local people. In 1895 the British South Africa Company was granted land and mineral rights over 10,000 square miles by Mozambique Gold, Land and Concession Company, a company it had bought in 1893. In order to better exploit the anticipated mineral wealth, the British South Africa Company incorporated a subsidiary, North Charterland Exploration Company in 1895. Effective administration of the region was achieved by the end of 1899.

In January 1900 Queen Victoria signed the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1900. This Order made official the name &quot;North-Eastern Rhodesia&quot; and formally proclaimed it a British protectorate. Under the Order a regime for the Company&#x27;s governance of the new protectorate was established. The new protectorate was administered by an Administrator appointed by the High Commissioner for South Africa. The High Commissioner legislated by proclamation for the protectorate. The protectorate was divided into seven administrative districts.

In 1900 Robert Edward Codrington was appointed as the first Administrator. He held this post until 1907. The last person to serve as Administrator was Lawrence Aubrey Wallace from 1907 until 1909 after which the position was left vacant. The capital was at Fort Jameson, today called Chipata.

When the protectorate was amalgamated with Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia to form Northern Rhodesia, the Administrator of Northern Rhodesia took over the functions that had been carried out by the Administrator of North-Eastern Rhodesia.

==Laws==
The laws of England applied to the protectorate, as far as local circumstances permitted. In civil cases between natives, native laws applied so far as was not repugnant to natural justice, or morality, or to any Order in Council, or any regulation thereunder. The Protectorate had a High Court, District Courts and Magistrates&#x27; Courts. Appeals from the Protectorate Courts could be made to the Supreme Court of Cape Colony and from there to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom.

<text>Music in the Canadian province Saskatchewan, one of the Prairie Provinces, includes a variety of genres including Indigenous music, folk, country, jazz, and classical traditions.

== History ==
In the early days of settlement, the musical landscape of the province was defined by military and police bands, church choirs, immigrant teachers, and many traveling groups of artists who traveled by rail across the continent.

== Cultural centres ==

===Regina===

Regina was incorporated in 1883, and became the provincial capital in 1905. Early in its history, the city boasted numerous bands, including a brass band, Musical and Dramatic Society and a number of church choirs.

Frank L. Laubach, a professional Scottish musician arrived in Regina in 1904, and was a prominent figure for eighteen years. During that time, he founded the Regina Philharmonic Society (1904), the Regina Orchestral Society (1908), the Regina Operatic Society (1909) and the province-wide Saskatchewan Music Festival (1908, with F. W. Chisholm).

After Laubach&#x27;s retirement in 1922, three choral and orchestra society groups exist: Regina Symphony Orchestra, Regina Male Voice Choir and Regina Choral Society. Only two years later, the three societies again merged to form the Regina Philharmonic Association. The Regina Symphony Orchestra later departed from that association, in 1926.

Musicians from Regina include Edith Fowke, Helen Dahlstrom, Nina Dempsey, Norman Farrow, Barbara Franklin, Stu Davis, Colin James, Audrey Johannesen, Muriel Kerr, Gary Kosloski, Peter Clements, June Kowalchuk, Owen Underhill, Gaelyne Gabora, Jack Semple, Rob Bryanton, Val Halla, Ron Scott, Brett Dolter, Beth Curry, Joel Fuller, Tyler Gilbert, John Dick, Dagan Harding (formerly of Despistado and Geronimo), Kenny Shields of Streetheart, and Paul Sloman from A Horse Called Horse.

Bands from Regina include The Dead South, Birds are Dinosaurs, Def 3, E Tea, Ghosts of Modern Man, Intergalactic Virgin, Into Eternity, LazerBlade, Library Voices, Pnice, Rah Rah, Tinsel Trees, The War Doves, and Robot Hive.

Dj&#x27;s and Electronic Music Artists Neon Tetra, Limbo, Guidewire, Jeff Galaxy, Short Fat Steve and Hardtoe, DIG.IT.ALL, Mike Trues, Submit, Pulsewidth, Cueball, DR. J, Jadybug, Square Sound Round Body, and A Horse Called Horse.

William Earl Brown founded the Soundaround label starting in the 1960s which featured many of the local country and ethnic bands recording in his basement studio. Mel West &amp; The Meteors, and The Canadian Downbeats had a few singles on the Soundaround label, later picked up Canada-wide via Stan Klees&#x27; &quot;Red Leaf&quot; label. Mel West &amp; The Meteors would chart Canada wide with their tracks &quot;Sad &amp; Blue&quot; and &quot;Seventh Saint&quot;. Earl had later success with the Grand Coulee Old Tyme Jug Band, and sold a number of albums via TV infomercials in the 1980s.

Most current bands/artists produce CDs by themselves or with the aid of the Saskatchewan Recording Industry Association (SaskMusic). However, an increasing number of artists have moved to post their music on websites such as Myspace.

===Saskatoon===

The city of Saskatoon was founded in 1882 and incorporated in 1903. During that time, the city&#x27;s population grew swiftly. In the early 20th century, operettas by Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, vaudeville and minstrel shows were among the most common forms of musical performance. Saskatoon&#x27;s first concert was held on December 1, 1884, by the Pioneer Society. It featured solos, duets, choruses, readings, and recitations.

The Saskatoon Philharmonic Society was founded in 1908, and won a prize at the first Saskatchewan Music Festival in 1909. The number of professional groups continued to grow. The Saskatoon Oratorio Society was founded in 1913, performing Handel&#x27;s Messiah with nearly 200 singers at Third Avenue Methodist Church in December 1913. The Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra formed under that name in 1931, after several earlier attempts to form an orchestra had occurred.

With the Great Depression in the early 1930s the musical community suffered. However, private teacher Lyell Gustin and his students presented twenty concerts a year in Saskatoon during the thirties, as well as teaching in surrounding areas. The Western Board of Music was organized in 1936, led by Arthur Collingwood, Chair of Music at the University of Saskatchewan. The music festival movement continued to expand, and in 1936 the Music Teachers’ Association was established.

The Celebrity Concert Series, held by the Saskatoon Kinsmen Club, began, in 1944, to introduce international celebrities every year for twenty-six years. Other groups include the Saskatoon Lyric Theatre Society (active 1955), the Saskatoon Opera Association (founded 1978), and the Prairie Opera Inc. (founded 1986). At the University of Saskatchewan, the student chorus the Greystone Singers was founded in 1959. Alumni of the Greystone Singers founded the Saskatoon Chamber Singers in 1977.

Musicians from Saskatoon include Joni Mitchell, Neil Chotem, Jon Ballantyne, Jen Lane, John Antoniuk, Brenton Price Dutton, Susan Pesklevits Jacks, Lorraine McAllister Richards, Irene Bubniuk, Brenda Baker, Chris Lindgren, Paddy Tutty, Kyle Riabko, David Swan, Lesia Zubrack Romanoff, Kim Brandt, Mike Ferbey (of the Rhythm Pals), Walter Babiak. and Jon Pare (The Jawns, Jon.Pea)

Bands from Saskatoon include Loop Bias, This Autumn Low, One Bad Son, The Sheepdogs, and Wide Mouth Mason.

In 2004, Theresa Sokyrka, born in Moose Jaw and since moved to Saskatoon, became first runner-up in the second season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; with her jazz and blues-influenced musicianship. Lionel Richie, appearing on one episode, said that Sokyrka had inside her the soul of an old black woman.

===Moose Jaw===

Moose Jaw is home to the Moose Jaw Band and Choral Festival, which has been held every year since 1950. The city co-hosted the Juno Awards of 2013. Connect-22, billed as Saskatchewan&#x27;s 22nd and Final Electronic &amp; Tribal Music Festival is scheduled for Besant Campground near Moose Jaw in 2017.

==Bands from Saskatchewan==
===Public bands===
The Saskatoon Concert Band is a civilian public band based in the city, consisting of two bands: the concert band and the auxiliary band. The Saskatoon Auxiliary Concert Band was formed in 1987 to cater to a demographic of musicians who came out of retirement. The Saskatoon Concert Band was founded in 1949 as the 406 Wing Band of the Royal Canadian Air Force and would later be renamed as the 23rd Wing Band. During this era, it took part in the Canadian National Exhibition as well as performing jointly with Mexican solo trumpeter Rafael Méndez as a guest artist. 10 years later, it was dissolved to create the Kinsmen Concert Band. In the mid-1960s, a section from the band came back into military service, this time as the HMCS Unicorn Band in the Royal Canadian Navy. The band evolved into its current form in 1982 as a non-profit organization.

The band took part Saskatchewan&#x27;s Centennial year celebrations, during which it toured Northern Saskatchewan, as well as performed at events in the Saskatchewan Legislature.

<text>Elias Nikolaus Ammerbach (c. 1530 – January 29, 1597) was a German organist and arranger of organ music of the Renaissance. He published the earliest printed book of organ music in Germany and is grouped among the composers known as the Colorists.

He was born in Naumburg, educated at the University of Leipzig (1548–49), and was afterwards employed as organist at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, probably for the rest of his life. He was married three times (his first two wives died). According to the preface of his 1571 publication of organ tablature he traveled to foreign lands to study, but he gave no specifics.

Ammerbach developed a method of music notation for keyboard playing, known as tablature, which was specifically adapted for organ. His method became known as the &quot;new German organ tablature&quot; and involved letter notation for the pitches with rhythmic symbols placed above.

It is not known if Ammerbach was himself a composer; if he was, he did not sign his music. His publications of music in tablature include arrangements of numerous composers popular in the mid-16th century, including Ludwig Senfl, Heinrich Isaac, Josquin des Prez, Clemens non Papa, Orlande de Lassus, and others; Lassus is particularly well represented, as can be expected both because of his extraordinary fame and his presence in Germany (he was in Munich between 1563 and 1594). Most of the secular music in Ammerbach&#x27;s collections is printed with German titles, while sacred music retains Latin. In his last publication (1583) he includes a considerable quantity of Italian madrigals arranged for keyboard.

<text>Y2J () is a Taiwanese rock band composed of two participants (Yuming Lai and Jane Huang) from the 2007 season of One Million Star, a singing competition. The band released its debut album &quot;Live For You&quot; on 25 August 2008.

The two-member band&#x27;s English name is derived Yuming Lai&#x27;s first initial (Y), the number of band members (2), and Jane Huang&#x27;s first initial (J). The band&#x27;s Chinese name &quot;Shenmu yu Tong&quot;, means &quot;sacred tree and pupil (of the eye)&quot;. &quot;Shénmù&quot; (神木), meaning &quot;sacred tree&quot;, comes from a large tree in Lai&#x27;s village which shares the name &quot;Yuming&quot;. &quot;Little Tong&quot; (瞳 tóng, &quot;pupil&quot;)&quot; is a nickname Jane Huang has had from childhood.

== Member history ==
Yuming Lai (Lai Ming Wei) (25 June 1984 -), was born in Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City), Taiwan, to a mother of the Atayal indigenous tribe. He graduated from Yongfeng High School and the Grand Cathay Institute of Technology. In 2007, he decided to participate in the One Million Star Taiwanese singing competition. In January 2008, he was crowned champion of the competition.

Jane Huang (Huang Mei Zhen) (19 January 1983 -), was born in Taitung County, Taiwan. She is a member of Taiwan&#x27;s Puyuma aboriginal people. In 2007, she finished seventh in the One Million Star Taiwanese singing competition, but her strength in the rock genre was clear. With the strong support of her fans, she became the popular vote winner.

In January 2008, the duo got their big break when they were signed to the Universal Music Taiwan record label. Since then, they have released a Chinese version of the song &quot;We Rock&quot; from the Disney Channel movie Camp Rock. In August 2008, their debut album was released in China, Taiwan, and other parts of East Asia, with music videos for the first single &quot;Live For You&quot; and several other songs.

<text>Pangil, officially the Municipality of Pangil (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 25,026 people.

==Etymology==
According to a paper entitled &quot;Alamat ng Pangil, Laguna&quot; written by Santiago T. Adre, there are three commonly believed and popular theories from which the name &quot;Pangil&quot; was derived:
# One theory reveals that the town derived its name from the peculiar shape of the land area of the town looked like especially when viewed from a high place. The town&#x27;s shape resembles a wild boar&#x27;s Fang.
# The second theory shows that the town&#x27;s name was derived from the name of the pioneer settlers in this area who were known as &quot;Panguilagan&quot;. The town was eventually given the name &quot;Panguil&quot; (this is the spelling which appears in moost Spanish Era documents) because most of the Spaniards had a hard time pronouncing the original term &quot;Panguilagan&quot;.
#The last theory discloses that the town&#x27;s first pre-Hispanic leader, a certain &quot;Gat Paguil&quot;. When the Spaniards had reached the area, it was this leader whom they recognized and talked with.

It was when the Americans came and took control of the Philippines in 1898, that the former name &quot;Panguil&quot; became what its present name &quot;Pangil&quot;.

==History==
Pangil is one of the oldest settlements in Laguna, rich in Hispanic, American and Japanese history. Discovered artifacts of the 12th century Ming and Sung Dynasty were attributed to Chinese immigrants and traders who settled in this place then. According to oral literature, the first leader of the area, which now encompasses four separate towns, was Gat Pangil, who united four ancient settlements to establish a Tagalog kingdom in the area. During the Hispanic period, Pangil became a staging ground of the Spanish missionaries in Christian Evangelization drive in 1578 in the present-day provinces of Rizal, Laguna and Quezon (then known as Tayabas), until it gained recognition as a town through the Franciscan friars in the year 1579.

Pangil has a high advocacy for environmental protection and fast becoming a hub for ecotourism. Vested with all sorts of natural attributes, such as clean and pristine water included its natural falls, rivers, nature trails, forest, communities by the lake, cool breeze by the lake, Baguio-like microclimate in its upland, represents a wide array of highland, lowland and lake-ecosystems. It also holds a vast of natural attributes that a small and simple town can possibly be contented of and when these resources are sustainably developed. And can contribute to provide all its need to move forward as a very progressive yet an environment-friendly municipality.

The municipality is strategically situated at the southern tip of Sierra Madre mountain range (six barangays) and along the eastern margin of Jalajala Peninsula and just west of the northwestern shore of the easternmost major embayment of Laguna de Bay (two barangays). Its narrow strip of territory traverses in its length by Pangil River (), valued for its pristine and abundant water contributing to its domestic, agricultural, ecotourism and other potential economic uses like bulk water and hydropower. Its topography is generally flat in between rolling and steep hills.

Currently, based on the results of the Barangay Information Management System (BIMS) data, the municipality of Pangil has a total population of 27,711 consisting of 5,728 households, with about 4.84 average household size. Of the eight barangays of Pangil, five are classified as urban barangays which is actually the communities that compose the town proper, one rural barangay in the upland and two other rural barangays across the lake.

===King Charles III in Pangil===

One of the revered myths in the town of Pangil is the belief that in the year 1724, Prince Carlos, the son of King Philip V of Spain, was banished from his country and was sent to the Philippines. The young prince stayed in the town for three years and resided with the Franciscans in the adjoining convent of the Paroquia del Nuestra Señora de la Natividad Church considered then as the biggest in Laguna. The prince was a known hunter and he enjoyed his stay in the Sierra Madre mountain range that was known as a good hunting ground for wild animals and fowls. He was also very fond of the creek that branched out from the Pangil River and now called as the Bambang Hari or King&#x27;s Canal.

By the year 1728, the King lifted the ban on the Prince and ordered the latter to return to their kingdom. With his ascension to the throne of Spain as King Charles III, he ordered his emissaries to send the statue of Nuestra Seńora de la O (Our Lady of Expectation) and the statue of Santo Nińo de la O (Holy Child of Expectation) as a sign of gratitude and appreciation to the Pangilenians for the hospitality and kindness that was accorded to him. Although this story is a source of pride among the Pangilenos, there is nothing in the historical records of the archives of the Franciscan Province in the Philippines or the Archdiocese of Manila, or the Ministerio del Ultramar in Madrid that could corroborate this folk history.

===Post-Spanish era===
In 1903, Pangil, alongside Famy, was absorbed into the town of Siniloan by virtue of Act No. 939. It was later separated from Siniloan to become a present-day municipality.

==Geography==
This town is separated by the Laguna de Bay from each other. Pangil is from Santa Cruz, from Manila, and from Lucena.

=== Barangays ===

Pangil is politically subdivided into 8 barangays: Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

The &quot;Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception&quot;, the principal church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chanthaburi, is the largest church in Thailand.

==Climate==
Chanthaburi has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;), with little variation in temperature throughout the year. Rainfall, however, varies dramatically by season. Rainfall is light and infrequent in the short dry season (December to February), but the wet season (April to October) features torrential rain. March and November are transitional months, during which significant rainfall may occur in some years, while in other years little rain falls.

==Transportation==
Route 3 (Sukhumvit Road) passes near Chanthaburi and connects to city to Rayong, Pattaya, Chonburi, and Bangkok to the northwest and Trat to the southeast. Route 317 connects Chanthaburi to Sa Kaeo.

<doc id="1275854" wikidata="Q18348382" url="?curid=1275854" title="Colony of New South Wales">
<text>The Colony of New South Wales was a colony of the British Empire from 1788 to 1901, when it became a State of the Commonwealth of Australia. At its greatest extent, the colony of New South Wales included the present-day Australian states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia, the Northern Territory as well as New Zealand. 

The first responsible self-government of New South Wales was formed on 6 June 1856 with Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson appointed by Governor Sir William Denison as its first Colonial Secretary.

==History==
===Formation===
On 18 January 1788, the First Fleet led by Captain Arthur Phillip founded the first British settlement in Australian history as a penal colony. Having set sail on 13 May 1787, Captain Arthur Phillip assumed the role of governor of the settlement upon arrival. On 18 January 1788, the first ship of the First Fleet, HMS &quot;Supply&quot;, with Phillip aboard, reached Botany Bay. However, Botany Bay was found to be unsuitable by Phillip. After Phillip led the exploration of Port Jackson, he sailed and reached Sydney Cove on night of 25 January 1788. On the morning of 26 January, men on board this ship went ashore and started clearing land for a camp. In the afternoon-evening, they erected a flag pole, raised the Union Jack, and the officers ashore made toasts to the Royal Family and the success of the colony. Probably some, or all, ships of the First Fleet were present for the flag raising. On the morning of 27 January, all the fit male convicts, marines, and likely some ships&#x27; crew went ashore to establish the camp and find food. The female convicts came ashore on 6 February 1788. About midday on 7 February, the convicts, marines and others who were staying were gathered by the Governor for the reading of the proclamation of New South Wales and a long reading of the rights of the convicts and others. Thus, the Colony of New South Wales was formally proclaimed on 7 February 1788. Before that, British naval administration applied. The colony faced extreme difficulty in its earliest years from water scarcity.

===Separation of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land===
Major-General Ralph Darling was appointed Governor of New South Wales in 1825, and in the same year he visited Hobart Town, and on 3 December proclaimed the establishment of the independent colony, of which he was Governor for three days.

===Separation of South Australia===
In 1834, the British Parliament passed the &quot;South Australia Act 1834&quot;, which enabled the colony of South Australia to be established.

===Separation of New Zealand===
On 16 November 1840, the British government issued the Charter for Erecting the Colony of New Zealand. The Charter stated that the Colony of New Zealand would be established as a Crown colony separate from New South Wales on 1 July 1841.

=== Separation of Victoria ===
On 1 July 1851, writs were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute independence of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria.

===Separation of Queensland===

A public meeting was held in 1851 to consider Queensland&#x27;s proposed separation from New South Wales. On 6 June 1859, Queen Victoria signed Letters Patent to form the separate Colony of Queensland. Brisbane was named as the capital city. On 10 December 1859, a proclamation was read by British author George Bowen, whereby Queensland was formally separated from the state of New South Wales. As a result, Bowen became the first Governor of Queensland. On 22 May 1860 the first Queensland election was held and Robert Herbert, Bowen&#x27;s private secretary, was appointed as the first Premier of Queensland.

== Demographics ==
According to the 1891 Census: 

* The Colony of New South Wales had a population of 1,123,954 people, with males counted at 608,003 and females counted at 515,951. This number included the population of people living in the Federal Territory, now the Australian Capital Territory. This number also did not include full-blooded Aboriginals. 

== Federation ==

The Federation of Australia was the process by which the six separate British self-governing colonies of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia agreed to unite and form the Commonwealth of Australia, establishing a system of federalism in Australia. This effectively changed New South Wales from being a colony to a state of Australia.

=== Australia Act ===

In the Australia Act 1986, the states of Australia achieved independence from the United Kingdom as constituents of Australian confederation. The Act followed discovery that, when Australia ratified the 1931 Statute of Westminster, only the federal state became independent of the United Kingdom due to State concerns of a grab for power by the Commonwealth Government. The 1986 Act ended the British government&#x27;s authority over the six Australian unitary states in confederation, just as it had ceased to have authority over the Commonwealth during the inter-war period. All colonial-era laws were no longer were subject to Imperial powers of disallowance and reservation. Acts of the federal state, i.e. the Commonwealth of Australia, remain subject to power of disallowance and reservation by the monarch of Australia, per sections 59 and 60 of the Australian Constitution. But as the Australian monarch can act only on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister, those two provisions are effectively dead letters.

<doc id="1275862" wikidata="Q947321" url="?curid=1275862" title="Microprinting">
<text>Microprinting is the production of recognizable patterns or characters in a printed medium at a scale that typically requires magnification to read with the naked eye. To the unaided eye, the text may appear as a solid line. Attempts to reproduce by methods of photocopy, image scanning, or pantograph typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale. Microprint is predominantly used as an anti-counterfeiting technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by widespread digital methods.

While microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was significantly influenced by Albert Boni in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs, this technology might enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space. Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. (, ) This process proved to produce a 6&quot; by 9&quot; index card that stored 100 pages of text from the normal-sized publications he was reproducing. Boni began the Readex Microprint company to produce and license this technology. He also published an article &quot;A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects (1943)&quot;, which appeared in a supplemental 18th issue of the Photo-Lab Index.

==Usage==
Currency commonly exhibits the highest quality (smallest size) of microprint because it demands the highest level of counterfeiting deterrence. For example, on the series 2004 United States $20 bill, microprint is hidden within the border in the lower left corner of the obverse (front) side, as well as the Twenty USA background.
Bank cheques, as well as various other items of value may also commonly leverage microprinting methods, but generally not of such extreme size. For example, personal bank cheques commonly place the characters &quot;MP&quot; next to the signature line of the cheque; these characters represent &quot;microprint&quot; and indicate that the signature line or other cheque features are actually microprinted characters. The microprinted characters are used as an anti-counterfeiting feature due to their difficulty in being reproduced while the prominent MP serves as an overt deterrent warning that the item employs microprint.

While microprinting at some scales may be readable to the human eye without microscopy, there is no differentiation between microprinting at these different scales.

The first US postage stamp to incorporate microprinting was the American Wildflower Series introduced by The United States Postal Service in 1992. It was also the first commemorative stamp wholly produced by offset lithography. The USPS has since issued other stamps with more complex microprinting incorporated along with dates, words, and abbreviations such as &quot;USPS&quot; and even entire stamp designs composed of microprint letters.

There was passing interest in microprinting as a solution to book storage in libraries in the 1940s. Librarian Fremont Rider championed microprinting over micro-film for its reduced cost. He also suggested that entire books could be printed on the backs of library catalog cards, which are generally blank, replacing the storage of full-sized books on library shelves.

==Production==
Microprint of the smallest scale is only producible by hand using engraved offset printing plates or some other method of intaglio (printmaking).

Digital microtext printers utilize specially designed fonts and ink for the purpose. The ink used is most commonly MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) toner particles but may also be polyester based toners and styrene acrylate polymer based toners. The ink is not limited to grayscale only, but may also use color toners or even more specialized toners containing dyes sensitive to ultraviolet or infrared radiation and producing fluorescence when exposed to those radiations.

Microprint of the scale capable by other printing methods cannot be produced by a digital printer regardless of the resolution of the device. Some digital fonts are designed specifically for the purpose of microprinting. These pseudo-microprint fonts are referred to as microtext.

Xerox was acclaimed for developing a microtext font they claimed could produce characters 1/100 of an inch tall (equivalent to 0.72 points).

In April 2015, Videojet Technologies released their 1650 High Resolution (HR) and 1620 HR Continuous Inkjet (CIJ) printers, said to be capable of printing sub-pixel size characters as small as 0.6 mm in height (equivalent to 1.70079 points). The printers use a 40-micron nozzle that outputs more than 100,000 drops per second of ink. While these printers make microprinting faster and easier to produce digitally, they still have not reached the true sub-pixel size of less than 1 point.

The smallest scale microtext a laser printer can produce is 0.5 pt.

==Microstructures==
Using gold nanoparticle inks on a glass substrate, scientists concluded that it was possible for them to control the production of print patterns to a scale of 2 microns. After printing, the nano-particle ink suspension was heated using a Gaussian laser; as it heated, the glass would expand due to the thermal conductivity of the gold nano-ink. In further experiments, they were able to fuse the nano-particles together into a tighter formation a continuous conductive line. Such experiments did not directly include font characters but could translate to such usage.

<text>Yitzchak Meir Rotenberg-Alter (, , ) (1799 – 10 March 1866), was the first Rebbe of the Ger Hasidic dynasty, which he founded in the town of Góra Kalwaria (known as &quot;Ger&quot; in Yiddish), Poland. He headed the Kupath Rabbi Meir Baal Haness Kollel Polen (Poland) Varsha (Warsaw) (Hebrew ). He was also known as The Chiddushei HaRim () for his Torah writings, and was sometimes fondly called &quot;Reb Itche Meir&quot; (Yiddish) by his followers.

== Biography ==
Alter was born in Magnuszew, Austrian Poland, in late 1799. He came from a very distinguished family of rabbis, among the most prominent in Germany and Poland. He was a descendant of Rashi and of the Tosafist, Rabbi Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg.

He married Feigele Lipszyc, daughter of Moshe &#x27;Halfon&#x27; Lipszyc, in 1811, and settled in Warsaw. They had fourteen children, according to most published sources, most of whom died in infancy and only one of his daughters didn&#x27;t die while he was alive. 

Alter became known as a Talmudic gaon. At first, he was close to the rebbes of Kozhnitz, however after some years, he was drawn to Rebbe Simcha Bunim of Peshischa, whose close adherent he became. After the demise of Simcha Bunim, Alter became a disciple of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, also known as the Kotzker Rebbe, who was famous for his acerbic wit and Talmudic brilliance. He was soon followed by a large number of Simcha Bunim&#x27;s followers. Alter and the Kotzker Rebbe eventually became brothers-in-law, when the latter married Chaya Lipszyc, the sister of Alter&#x27;s wife Feigele.

In 1830, he was forced to change his name to &quot;Alter&quot; because of his support towards the Poles during the November Uprising.

One of his sons, Avraham Mordechai, and three daughters, Cyna Pesia, Leah Hudes, and Esther, survived to adulthood and married. However, by the time of Alter&#x27;s death on 23 Adar 5626 (1866), only one child (Esther) remained alive.

After his passing, Rabbi Chanoch Henoch of Aleksander succeeded him in his position and transferred the Chasidic center to the city of Alexander. Four years later, Rabbi Alexander passed away, and the Alter&#x27;s grandson, Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter, known as &quot;Sfas Emes&quot; (the son of Avraham Mordechai), became the new Rebbe of the Chasidic dynasty.

==Works==
Rabbi Alter is still well known for his talmudic commentary, though he wrote on many other areas. Extant published works are:

<text>Bergen Arches is an abandoned railroad right of way through Bergen Hill (the lower New Jersey Palisades) in Jersey City, New Jersey.

==History==
Bergen Arches is the common name for the Erie Cut, the Erie Railroad&#x27;s mile-long, four-track cut which linked the railroad&#x27;s main line to its Hudson River waterfront Pavonia Terminal, where travelers to Manhattan could transfer to the Pavonia Ferry or the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. From 1906 to 1910, using 250,000 pounds of dynamite, workers blasted through of blue trap rock; of earth were excavated. There were construction cost overruns (and settlements paid to local homeowners for damage and injuries from flying rock), with a total cost around $5 million, that led to financial trouble for the Erie and the cancellation of plans to build a new terminal along the Jersey City waterfront. The term &quot;Bergen Arches&quot; originally referred to the massive bridges over the cut, but the two terms have become synonymous.

The last trains to the terminal ran in 1957. The line was abandoned that year. The adjacent tunnel (the Long Dock Tunnel) from the mid-19th century that the Erie Cut replaced is used for freight, and is being restored as part of Liberty Corridor Project as an extension of National Docks Secondary line.

==Future==
Various projects have been proposed for the abandoned track bed: for a four-lane or six-lane highway that would connect the New Jersey Turnpike and U.S. Route 1/9 bypassing traffic headed along New Jersey Route 139 for the Holland Tunnel, extension of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail, or in conjunction with the Harsimus Stem Embankment, a recreational greenway.

A freeway proposed in 1989 by Governor Thomas Kean was strongly supported by then-Mayor Bret Schundler. In 1998, this project was allocated $26 million in the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. During the 2001 mayoral race, candidates instead lobbied for a mass transit line, and in 2002 the plans were dropped during Mayor Cunningham&#x27;s administration. In that year, Parsons Brinckerhoff, a consulting firm, released another report commissioned by New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and describing the conditions and analyzing of various options. NJDOT has continued to fund studies for the project. In March 2011, an additional $13.4 million was allocated to advance the project.

A Bergen Arches Preservation Coalition has proposed to run the East Coast Greenway through the Arches.

<text>The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) is the agency responsible for transportation issues and policy in New Jersey, including maintaining and operating the state&#x27;s highway and public road system, planning and developing transportation policy, and assisting with rail, freight, and intermodal transportation issues. It is headed by the Commissioner of Transportation. The present acting commissioner is Francis K. O&#x27;Connor.

==History==

The agency that became NJDOT began as the New Jersey State Highway Department (NJSHD) . NJDOT was established in 1966 as the first state transportation agency in the United States. The Transportation Act of 1966 (Chapter 301, Public Laws, 1966) established the NJDOT on December 12, 1966.

Since the late 1970s, NJDOT has been phasing out or modifying many traffic circles in New Jersey. In 1979, with the establishment of New Jersey Transit, NJDOT&#x27;s rail division, which funded and supported state-sponsored passenger rail service, was folded into the new agency.

Until 2003, the NJDOT included the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which was reorganized as the self-operating New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC).

== Divisions, programs and services ==

=== Public roads ===
NJDOT operates, develops, and maintains the State&#x27;s public road system, including Interstate, State and Federal highways, with a total of 2,316.69 miles of NJDOT-owned and operated roads (as of July 2015). Most major highways including Interstate, U.S. and NJ State routes within New Jersey are under NJDOT jurisdiction, except toll routes including the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway (under the New Jersey Turnpike Authority) and the Atlantic City Expressway as well as the interstate toll bridges and tunnels.

=== Freight planning ===
NJDOT develops interim and long-term plans and strategic policy on freight and shipping in and around the state. These intermodal policies cover trucking, rail, maritime and air freight.

=== Capital programs ===
The Transportation Capital Program and the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) allocate state and federal transportation funding, including projected projects and investment.

=== Community programs ===
Assistance to local communities and grants for transportation-related projects, such as transit villages.

=== Engineering ===
This refers to technical planning, development, design and research for projects.

=== Bureau of Aeronautics ===
NJDOT&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics has general oversight of public use airports and restricted use facilities, including airstrips, heliports and balloon ports, addresses aviation safety and provides licensing and registration on aviation facilities and aerial activities including advertising, aerial racing, and sports.

=== Railroads ===
The NJDOT was also responsible for funding and supporting passenger rail service within New Jersey and to and from nearby points from the late 1960s onward, including procuring new modern equipment and rolling stock. The agency purchased EMD GP40Ps for the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1968, the GE U34CH locomotives and Comet I cars for the Erie Lackawanna (1970) and Arrow I, II &amp; III electric MU cars for the Penn Central in 1968–69, 1974 and 1977–78 respectively. During 1976 NJDOT took control of passenger rail routes operated by the Penn Central, Erie Lackawanna, CNJ and Reading Lines (with Conrail operating services under contract).

In 1979, New Jersey Transit assumed responsibilities for passenger rail in New Jersey.

NJDOT is a member of the Northeast Corridor Commission.

==Traffic management==

NJDOT maintains the Statewide Traffic Management Center (sTMC) headquartered in Woodbridge Township. STMC is also the home to New Jersey State Police and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. STMC is staffed 24/7 and is responsible for the coordination and logistics of statewide resources during major incidents within New Jersey.

<text>Raymond Boulevard is a major thoroughfare in Newark, New Jersey. The eastern portion of the road acts as the westbound member of a one-way pair; eastbound traffic uses Market Street and Ferry Street. Raymond Boulevard carries eastbound and westbound traffic west of Market Street, passing through Newark Penn Station and intersecting with McCarter Highway (New Jersey Route 21), Broad Street, Halsey Street, Washington Street, among others.

==History==
The street was built on the filled-in Morris Canal, a portion of which became the underground right-of-way for the Newark City Subway. The eastern were part of the Lincoln Highway.

==Route description==

The road carries traffic from the interchange at the west end of the Pulaski Skyway (U.S. Route 1/9) and U.S. Route 1-9 Truck in the Ironbound, passing thorough historic Riverbank Park and abutting Newark Riverfront Park on the Passaic River.

At Pennsylvania Station, it enters the high-tech corridor of downtown Newark and is lined with modern office skyscrapers such as the Gateway Center, Newark Legal Center, One Newark Center, and 80 Park Plaza.

The Eleven 80 building, an Art Deco office tower and one of the tallest buildings in Newark, is named for its Raymond Boulevard address, across from Military Park.

The avenue crosses Broad Street two blocks north of Four Corners, the traditional center of the city. Proceeding west, it passes the campuses of Rutgers–Newark and New Jersey Institute of Technology. At the Warren Street intersection, Raymond Boulevard ends when it merges into Lock Street.

<text>Silent is a Brazilian Arena Rock Band from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

== Biography ==
A Brazilian rock band imagined and created in February of 91 by Gus Andriew (Gustavo Andriewiski). The goal was to start a band that in two months would already have material ready to be presented in a first concert. For that he summoned friends, like L.A. Tilly who had already been on past musical ventures, on the drums, followed by Marcoz Ferraz on the bass, and lastly Alexandre França on lead guitar. In two months SILENT was ready and able to perform. Their first show was on April 25 of 1991, in the once renowned but now closed Babilônia (night club and concert hall). The concert brought in a crowd of about 900 people. Two months passed and they recorded their first demo, and in January of 92 SILENT shot their first music video (For the song Watching), that was selected to premier on MTV Brazil’s show called “Demo MTV” and was included in the regular channel programing. In 93 Marcoz left the band, being replaced by Federico Arana, on the bass and vocals. In the same year SILENT starred in the sound track of a Brazilian soap opera called “O Mapa da Mina”, produced by Rede Globo de Televisão. In the following years that would repeat itself, in 96 and 97, which finally lead to the release of the album “The Bright Side” in 2001, that received raved reviews from around the world, even scoring an 83 grade in the well-known Japanese magazine Burnn. That year also marked the leave of Gustavo Andriewiski from the band. From 2002 to 2005 the band tried to reinvent itself and release new material, but all of these efforts were in vain, and the band broke up.

== Before The Comeback ==
In 2006 Gustavo, Alexandre França and Tilly rejoined in a modern Brazilian rock act called &#x27;Repplica&#x27;. At first they had André Bighinzolli (Genoma, Metalmorphose) playing the bass, later replaced by Márcio Chicralla (Celso Blues Boy Band). This project ended in 2010.

==The Comeback==
In December 2010, Gustavo, Alexandre, and Tilly, found themselves on a bar table throwing around ideas, when Alexandre suggested that they should give new life to the once forgotten idea of SILENT, and they decided to schedule their first come back rehearsal after the holidays, in January 2011. Destiny had a different plan, and, Alexandre França died alongside his wife and his son, in one of the worst natural disasters of Brazilian history. After one year of grieving, Gustavo and Tilly decided to carry on with their friend’s plan. 2012 and 2013 were dedicated to forming a new quartet, and rerecording old songs from the original repertoire of the first years of the band, and also composing new songs.

==Reborn==
With a new formation defined in 2014, Gustavo Andriewiski on guitar and vocals, Alex Cavalcanti on guitar, Douglas Boiago on the bass, and Luiz “Tilly” Alexandre on the drums, they start recording their second album. In 2015, with their new album “Land Of Lightning” ready, videos from the beginning of their careers salvaged, and a new single/music video ready to be released, the band signed their first contract with the recording label Planet Music Brazil. The single &quot;Around The Sun&quot; was released in October 2015, followed by the Album &quot;Land Of Lightning&quot;, released on November. Soon after that, the video clip for &quot;Around The Sun&quot; is released on Vevo and in their Silent Vevo YouTube channel.

<doc id="1275907" wikidata="Q4119820" url="?curid=1275907" title="Islam in Ivory Coast">
<text>Islam was the first Abrahamic monotheistic religion to arrive in Ivory Coast. According to the 2021 census, it is professed by 42.5% of the total population. 

As of the late 1980s, only the most devout Muslims in Ivory Coast prayed, fasted, and gave alms as required by strict tenets of Islam, and only the most wealthy performed the hajj. Most Ivoirian Muslims are Sunni, following the Maliki version of Islamic law. Sufism, involving the organization of mystical brotherhoods (Tariqa) for the purification and spread of Islam, is also widespread, laced with indigenous beliefs and practices. The four major Sufi brotherhoods are all represented in Ivory Coast, although the Qadiriya, founded in the eleventh century, and the Tidjaniya, founded in the eighteenth century, are most popular. The Qadiriya is prevalent in the west, and the Tidjaniya, in the east. The other two major Islamic brotherhoods have few adherents in Ivory Coast. The Senoussiya is identified with Libya, where its influence is substantial. Ahmadiyya movement is also present in Ivory Coast.

The significant religious authority is the marabout. He is believed to be a miracle worker, a physician, and a mystic, who exercises both magical and moral authority. He is also respected as a dispenser of amulets, which protect the wearer—Muslim or non-Muslim—against evil. The influence of marabouts has produced a number of reactions in Ivoirian society, among them a series of reformist movements. These reform movements often condemn Sufism and marabouts as un-Islamic, but the poor see that marabouts often speak out on behalf of the downtrodden.

Hamallism began as an Islamic reform movement in the French Sudan early in the twentieth century and has provided a channel for expressing political and religious discontent. Its founder, Hamallah, was exiled from the French Sudan to Ivory Coast during the 1930s. He preached Islamic reform tempered by tolerance of many local practices, but he condemned many aspects of Sufism. Orthodox brotherhoods were able to convince the French authorities in Ivory Coast that Hamallah had been responsible for earlier political uprisings in the French Sudan. Authorities then expelled Hamallah from Ivory Coast and banned his teachings.

The massive immigration of Muslims from the Muslim majority countries Burkina Faso and Mali helped to increase the number of Muslims substantially.

According to Pew Forum the population of Shia in Ivory Coast is less than one percent of the total Muslim population of Ivory Coast while as per Imam Husayn (as) Encyclopedia the population of Shia in Ivory Coast is around five percent of the total Muslim population of Ivory Coast.

<text>Box Hill Central is a regional shopping centre complex and public transport hub located in the eastern Melbourne suburb of Box Hill, Australia. It is made up of two separate centres, Box Hill Central South and Box Hill Central North. The centre is approximately east of the Melbourne central business district.

With over of leasable area, the centre features the largest concentration of retail space in Box Hill, one of nine designated Metropolitan Activity Centres in Melbourne that are centralised hubs of employment, services and housing. After years of consolidating nearby property holdings, Box Hill Central is currently undergoing a major expansion as part of a 10 year masterplan scheduled to be fully completed by 2030.

==History==

===Background===
The rapid expansion of Melbourne&#x27;s suburbs following the Second World War caused significant population increases in the eastern parts of the metropolitan area. Box Hill, previously a separate town, became more connected to the rest of the city and grew in importance as a regional centre. 

Following the opening of the Forest Hill Chase shopping centre in 1964, the Box Hill City Council and existing businessowners in Box Hill became worried about the competition this would bring. A spate of further centralised shopping centres built in nearby Ringwood and Doncaster only heightened their concerns and accelerated plans for Box Hill to develop its own retail hub. An old timber yard in Clisby Street had been identified as a possible site for a large-scale development in 1961 which now became the focal point for a new shopping centre.

===Opening - north===
Following many years of planning, tenders were called for a new centre in 1973 for a new multi-storey carpark and shopping centre. In November 1974 it opened as &quot;Whitehorse Plaza&quot;, a three-level regional shopping centre, at a cost of $3.5 million. it housed anchor tenants such as Coles, Kmart, and Venture, larger tenants like Sussans, Williams The Shoeman, Priceline, Lincraft, and Medicare, along with other assorted retailers, eateries, and services. This is the section today known as &quot;Box Hill Central North&quot;.

===Opening - south===
Box Hill Central South was originally constructed in the early 1980s, when the old Box Hill railway station and level crossing was removed, and Market and Main Streets were closed to traffic. Box Hill Central opened in 1987, as a single-level regional shopping centre. It housed anchor tenants Target and Woolworths.

===First redevelopment - south (1998-2000)===
The shopping centre was reconstructed in 1998 and in 2000 and acquired by Centro Properties, who renamed it to Centro Box Hill South, though many still referred to it as Box Hill Central.

===First redevelopment - north (2000-2003)===
Due to a lack of tenants, Whitehorse Plaza closed in 2000 before undergoing a complete refurbishment. All tenancies within the centre were demolished, the development&#x27;s layout and car parks were reconfigured, and there was major refurbishment of external and internal facades. Named Whitehorse City before opening, the centre was reopened on 1 July 2003 by Centro Properties as &quot;Centro Whitehorse&quot;, a two-level regional shopping centre, featuring anchor tenants Coles and Best &amp; Less.

===Second redevelopment - north (2007)===
In 2007, &quot;Centro Whitehorse&quot; was rebranded to &quot;Centro Box Hill North&quot; and partially redeveloped, with Best &amp; Less closing down and being replaced by a Harris Scarfe location.

On 2 February 2020, Harris Scarfe closed its store at Box Hill, as part of its restructure and reduction in store locations. The location was leased to Dimmeys. The Coles supermarket closed in August 2022 and relocated to Box Hill Central South.

===Second redevelopment - south (2010)===

In 2010, the shopping centre was again refurbished, with Target being replaced by Big W, and Woolworths being renovated and reopened.

===Rebranding and consolidation (2013)===
In 2013, both centres were again rebranded as &quot;Box Hill Central South&quot; and &quot;Box Hill Central North&quot; as a result of an organisation-wide rebranding of all centres owned by Federation Limited.

===Third redevelopment and masterplan (2021-onwards)===
In 2020 Vicinity Centres released a masterplan planning significant changes to both the north and south sections of the centre. It outlined plans to move retail activity to the south side of the site, construct additional office and residential towers, and provide new open space. Upon completion, it is planned to cover over of residential, office and retail area.

The first stage of the ten year masterplan commenced in July 2021 and was completed in August 2022. This added a new entrance to Box Hill Central South to the south from Carrington Road and rebuilt the south-western corner of the site to a new design and with additional retail space. A new Coles supermarket replaced the former Big W.

==Complex==
===Box Hill Central North===
This older and largest section of the complex was formerly known as &quot;Whitehorse Plaza&quot;. It comprises two floors with some minor office use.

===Box Hill Central South===

Straddling the underground railway station, this building is bounded by Station Street, Carrington Road, Thurston Street and Main Street. It is significantly larger than its northern counterpart and consists of several newer and older sections.

===Office use===
Both centres have office facilities located above or adjacent to the retail areas. Box Hill Central South provides of co-working office space while the North houses a small number of medical facilities.

===Transport interchange===

Box Hill Central South is built above the underground Box Hill railway station with the entrance contained inside the shopping centre. It provides a direct link through the shopping complex to the Box Hill Bus Station on its roof, servicing 18 different bus routes. The centre is also serviced by tram route 109 with its terminus nearby on Whitehorse Road.

Box Hill Central has seven levels of undercover car parking spread across the south and north sections of the complex. Some bicycle parking is also located at most major entrances.

==Retail==
The two shopping centres have a combined 157 shops and services across a gross leasable area of . The majority of this area is located in Box Hill Central South. Its two anchor tenants, Coles and Woolworths supermarkets, occupy 31% of the total leasable space of the South complex. Coles was formerly located in the Box Hill Central North complex before moving to its present space in 2022.

Other mini major retailers in Box Hill Central include NQR, Priceline Pharmacy, Daiso and Dimmeys.

A large portion of both centres are dedicated to food and beverage outlets. These are concentrated in two central food courts, one in each of the centres, as well as along Main Street between the two buildings.

Previous tenants of Box Hill Central include Big W, Kmart, Kmart Food, Target, Venture, Harris Scarfe, EB Games, Sanity and Best &amp; Less.

The Box Hill region is known for its Chinese population, with the first wave being Hong Kong Chinese followed by a larger wave of Mainland Chinese alongside a smaller number of Taiwanese, Malaysians and Vietnamese. This is reflected in the produce in many of the food and beverage outlets, medicinal herb retailers and clothing shops.

<doc id="1275912" wikidata="Q2891454" url="?curid=1275912" title="Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter">
<text>Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter (, 15 April 1847 – 11 January 1905), also known by the title of his main work, the Sfas Emes (Ashkenazic Pronunciation) or &quot;Sefat Emet (&quot;) (Modern Hebrew), was a Hasidic rabbi who succeeded his grandfather, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter, as the &quot;Av beis din&quot; (head of the rabbinical court) and Rav of Góra Kalwaria, Poland (known in Yiddish as the town of Ger), and succeeded Rabbi Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin of Aleksander as Rebbe of the Gerrer Hasidim.

==Biography==
===Early years===
He was born in 1847 (5608) and named Yehudah Leib, he was known to family and friends as Leybl. His father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, died when Yehudah Leib was only eight years old, and his mother Mrs. Esther Alter (née Landsztajn) died before that in 1849. Orphaned of both parents, he was brought up by his grandparents, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter (known as the &quot;Chiddushei Harim&quot;) and his wife. When he was about ten years old, his grandfather took him to visit the Kotzker Rebbe, which left a lifelong impression on him.

In 1862 he married Yocheved Rivka, daughter of Yehuda Leib (&quot;Yidl&quot;) Kaminer, descendant of the Magen Abraham. In order not to have the same name as his father-in-law, his own name was changed to Yehudah Aryeh Leib. He is said to have been attached to the name Yehudah, and was upset at not being able to use it as his name any longer.

===Leadership===
When his grandfather, Yitzchak Meir, died in 1866, many of the Gerrer Hasidim sought to bestow the mantle of leadership upon eighteen-year-old Yehudah Aryeh Leib. He refused that position, and leadership went to Rabbi Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin of Aleksandrów Łódzki. However, after the death of the latter in 1870, the Hasidim succeeded in gaining Alter&#x27;s assent to become their Rebbe. Ten children were born to Alter, of whom four sons and two daughters stayed alive after his death. The eldest among them was Rabbi Avraham Mordechai, who would later succeed him as leader.

===Death and burial===
On September 2, 1901, his wife, Yocheved Rivka, passed away. A year later, a fire consumed the Chassidic buildings in Góra Kalwaria, including Alter&#x27;s home and hisBeth midrash. Following this, Alter married his second wife, Reizel, the daughter of Rabbi Baruch Halberstam of Gorlice.

During the Russo-Japanese War, many of his young followers were drafted into the Russian Army and sent to the battlefields in Manchuria. Alter was very worried over these devotees and would constantly write to them. His health suffered, and he died at the age of 57 on 11 January 1905 (5 Shevat 5665).



===Succession===
Alter was succeeded as Gerrer Rebbe by his son, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter. Most of Gerrer hasidim followed Avraham Mordechai, but some chasidim followed the brother-in-law of Alter - Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Justman of Piltz.

==Lasting influence==
Alter was one of the greatest Torah scholars of his generation, teaching students such as Rabbi Nachman Shlomo Greenspan and many others. His output was prodigious, and his works (all entitled &quot;Sfas Emes&quot;) deal with the Talmud, the ethics of the Midrash, and mysticism of the Zohar.

His Torah homilies as delivered to his hasidim, and arranged according to the weekly parashah and the festivals, were the first to be published posthumously under the name &quot;Sfas Emes&quot; (שפת אמת). The title was taken from the closing words of the final piece he wrote (&quot;Sfas Emes&quot;, Vayechi 5665). His &quot;chiddushim&quot; (original Torah thoughts) on many Talmudic tractates, and on Yoreh De&#x27;ah, have been published under the same name.

The Sochatchover Rebbe, Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain (known as the &quot;Avnei Nezer&quot;), a leading Torah scholar and posek in his own right, is said to have maintained two bookcases — one for Rishonim (earlier commentators) and another for Acharonim (later commentators). The volumes of the &quot;Sfas Emes&quot;, written in the late 1800s, were to be found in his bookcase containing the Rishonim. To study some portions of the Talmud without the &quot;Sfas Emes&quot; is unthinkable to the modern-day scholar. 

The Sfas Emes Yeshiva in Jerusalem is named after him and includes his teachings in the curriculum.

<text>The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) is an American non-profit organization dedicated to advancing professional licensure for engineers and surveyors. The Council’s members are the engineering and surveying licensure boards from all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These boards are divided into four geographic zones: Central, Northeast, Southern, Western. It is headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina.

== Engineering ==
NCEES develops and scores the FE, PE and SE exams for engineering licensure. The FE exam is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed engineer (PE). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree from an EAC/ABET- accredited program. The PE exam is designed to test for a minimum level of competency in a particular engineering discipline. It is designed for engineers who have gained a minimum of four years of work experience in their chosen engineering discipline. The PE Structural Engineering exam is predominantly developed to test engineers who practice in jurisdictions that license structural engineers separately from other professional engineers.

* The Fundamentals of Engineering exam (FE exam) is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed engineer (PE). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree from an EAC/ABET-accredited program. The FE exam is a computer-based exam administered year-round at NCEES-approved Pearson VUE test centers.
* The Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam (PE exam) tests for a minimum level of competency in a particular engineering discipline. It is designed for engineers who have gained a minimum of four years’ post-college work experience in their chosen engineering discipline.
* The PE Structural Engineering exam tests for a minimum level of competency in structural engineering. It is predominantly developed to test engineers who practice in jurisdictions that license structural engineers separately from other professional engineers. This 16-hour exam uses separate vertical and lateral components to test one&#x27;s ability to safely design buildings or bridges, especially in areas of high seismicity and high wind.

== Land Surveying ==
NCEES also prepares examinations for land surveyor licensing in the United States. These exams consist of:

* The Fundamentals of Surveying (FS) exam is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed surveyor (PS). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate surveying degree from an ABET accredited program. The FS exam is a computer-based exam administered year-round in testing windows at NCEES-approved Pearson VUE test centers.
* The Principles and Practice of Surveying (PS) exam tests one&#x27;s ability to practice the surveying profession competently. It is designed for surveyors who have gained at least four years of professional experience.

== Records ==
The NCEES Records program is designed for currently licensed engineers and surveyors who are looking for an easier and faster way to complete the licensure process in multiple jurisdictions, including all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An established NCEES Record will include most—if not all—of the materials one needs to apply for comity licensure in additional states and territories.

== Credentials evaluations ==
NCEES Credentials Evaluations is a service for state licensing boards and applicants. It is designed primarily for candidates who have earned their degrees outside the United States and are pursuing licensure through one of the member licensing boards of NCEES.

<doc id="1275926" wikidata="Q449235" url="?curid=1275926" title="James Fenton">
<text>James Martin Fenton (born 25 April 1949) is an English poet, journalist and literary critic. He is a former Oxford Professor of Poetry.

==Life and career==
Born in Lincoln, Fenton grew up in Lincolnshire and Staffordshire, the son of Canon John Fenton, a biblical scholar. He was educated at the Durham Choristers School, Repton and Magdalen College, Oxford. He graduated with a B.A. in 1970.

While at school Fenton acquired an enthusiasm for the work of W. H. Auden. At Oxford, his tutor John Fuller, who was writing &quot;A Reader&#x27;s Guide to W. H. Auden&quot; at the time, further encouraged that enthusiasm. Auden became perhaps the most significant single influence on Fenton&#x27;s work.

In his first year at university, Fenton won the Newdigate Prize for his sonnet sequence &quot;Our Western Furniture&quot;. Later published by Fuller&#x27;s Sycamore Press, it largely concerns the cultural collision in the 19th century between the United States and Japan. It displays in embryo many of the characteristics that define Fenton&#x27;s later work: technical mastery combined with a fascination with issues that arise from the Western interaction with other cultures. &quot;Our Western Furniture&quot; was followed by &quot;Exempla&quot;, a poetry sequence later published in &quot;The Memory of War&quot;. The poem is notable for its frequent use of unfamiliar words, as well as commonplace words employed in an unfamiliar manner.

While studying at Oxford, Fenton became a close friend of Christopher Hitchens, whose memoir &quot;Hitch-22&quot; is dedicated to Fenton and has a chapter on their friendship. Hitchens praised Fenton&#x27;s extraordinary talent, stating that he too believed him to be the greatest poet of his generation. He also expounded on Fenton&#x27;s modesty, describing him as infinitely more mature than himself and Martin Amis. Fenton and Hitchens shared a house together in their third year, and continued to be close friends until Hitchens&#x27;s death. Fenton read his poem &#x27;For Andrew Wood&#x27; at the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; Hitchens memorial service.

His first collection, &quot;Terminal Moraine&quot; (1972) won a Gregory Award. With the proceeds he traveled to East Asia, where he wrote of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam and the end of the Lon Nol regime in Cambodia, which presaged the rise of Pol Pot. The poems featured in his collection &quot;The Memory of War&quot; (1982) ensured his reputation as one of the greatest war poets of his time.

Fenton returned to London in 1976. He was political correspondent of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, where he worked alongside Christopher Hitchens, Julian Barnes and Martin Amis. He became the Assistant Literary Editor in 1971, and Editorial Assistant in 1972. Hitchens had formally recruited Fenton to the International Socialists and earlier in his journalistic career, like Hitchens, Fenton had written for &quot;Socialist Worker&quot;, the weekly paper of the International Socialists. Fenton was an occasional war reporter in Vietnam during the late phase of the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975. His experiences in Vietnam and Cambodia from summer 1973 form a part of &quot;All the Wrong Places&quot; (1988). The publication of the book revealed some of Fenton&#x27;s second thoughts about revolutionary socialism.

In 1983, Fenton accompanied his friend Redmond O&#x27;Hanlon to Borneo. A description of the voyage can be found in the book &quot;Into the Heart of Borneo&quot;.

Fenton won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize in 1984 for &quot;Children in Exile: Poems 1968–1984&quot;. He was appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry in 1994, a post he held till 1999. He was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 2007. The American composer Charles Wuorinen set several of his poems to music, and Fenton served as librettist for Wuorinen&#x27;s opera &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot; (2001, premiered in 2004), based on Salman Rushdie&#x27;s novel.

Fenton has said: &quot;The writing of a poem is like a child throwing stones into a mineshaft. You compose first, then you listen for the reverberation.&quot; In response to criticisms of his comparatively slim &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (2006), he warned against the notion of poets churning out poetry in a regular, automated fashion.

Fenton has been a frequent contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. He once wrote the head column in the editorials of each Friday&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. In 2007, he appeared in a list of the &quot;100 most influential gay and lesbian people in Britain&quot; published by &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;.

Fenton&#x27;s partner is Darryl Pinckney, the prize-winning novelist, playwright and essayist perhaps best known for the novel &quot;High Cotton&quot; (1992).

===Musical theatre influence===
Fenton has been influenced in his writing by musical theatre, as evidenced in &quot;Here Come the Drum Majorettes&quot; from &quot;Out of Danger&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Gleb meet Glubb.
Glubb meet Glob.
God that&#x27;s glum, that glib Glob dig.
&#x27;Dig that bog!&#x27;
&#x27;Frag that frog.&#x27;
Stap that chap, he snuck that cig.&#x27;&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

He was the original English librettist for the musical of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; but Cameron Mackintosh later replaced him with Herbert Kretzmer. Kretzmer credited Fenton with creating the general structure of the adaptation, and Fenton is credited for additional lyrics, for which he receives royalties, as stipulated in his contract.

<doc id="1275939" wikidata="Q5592460" url="?curid=1275939" title="Graffiti House">
<text>The Graffiti House, located at 19484 Brandy Road in the eastern end of the town of Brandy Station, Virginia, is believed by the Brandy Station Foundation to have been built in 1858. It is one of few dwellings in the village built before the American Civil War to survive intact to this day. The house is notable because of the Civil War era graffiti on many of the walls. The graffiti found includes names, drawings, names of units, and inscriptions left by soldiers.

==History==
Because of its location on the Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad and the Carolina Road, the house, which was less than from the train depot, is thought by the Foundation to have been a commercial building as well as a dwelling. The Foundation reports that some graffiti has been removed or destroyed but considerable graffiti still remain. New graffiti were discovered as recently as December 2010.

The house was owned by James Barbour (brother of the railroad&#x27;s president John S. Barbour Jr.) during the Civil War but the Barbour family&#x27;s main residence was on a ridge about to the south (and during the war was used by Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart). Barbour served on the staff of Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell until January 1863.

Because of its strategic location near the railroad, this house was used extensively by both the Union Army and Confederate States Army throughout the Civil War. Confederates used it as a field hospital during the Battle of Brandy Station and at other times when battles occurred in the area. It was probably used as a field hospital for wounded soldiers evacuated by train after the Battle of First Bull Run or First Manassas. The earliest known graffiti in the house date to the Second Manassas Campaign in August 1862, as the armies transited Culpeper County.

At the outset of the Gettysburg Campaign, the Battle of Brandy Station, the largest cavalry battle ever to take place in North America occurred on June 9, 1863, in the fields adjacent to the Graffiti House and extended to the heights on which the main house stood. After the fighting ended, the lower house was used as a Confederate field hospital. Later that year, Federal troops occupied the building when the Army of the Potomac camped in Culpeper County during the winter of 1863–64. The house was headquarters to Brigadier General Henry Prince, a division commander in the Third Corps of the Army of the Potomac during the Union Army pursuit of the Army of Northern Virginia after its retreat from the Battle of Gettysburg, sometimes called the Rapidan campaign but this name could be confused with the beginning of the Overland Campaign, and during the Mine Run Campaign later in 1863.

The plaster walls on the house&#x27;s second floor are covered with an outstanding and unique collection of charcoal and pencil graffiti left by soldiers from both armies. In addition to their autographs, the soldiers drew elaborate pictures of men and women, and wrote inscriptions commemorating their units and their battles. After the war, new paint and wallpaper led to their being forgotten. The graffiti were rediscovered during a renovation in 1993. The Brandy Station Foundation purchased the house in 2002, and its website lists the days it is open for viewing. The house includes a small museum and serves as a headquarters for the Brandy Station Foundation and the Foundation&#x27;s visitor center for the Brandy Station battlefield.

<text>Gunns Limited was a major forestry enterprise located in Tasmania, Australia. It had operations in forest management, woodchipping, sawmilling and veneer production. The company was placed into liquidation in March 2013.

==History==
Founded in 1875 by brothers John and Thomas Gunn, it was one of Australia&#x27;s oldest companies. It had over 900 square kilometres of plantations, mainly eucalyptus trees. In 2001 Gunns paid $335 million for Tasmania&#x27;s biggest woodchip company, North Forest Products, making it Australia&#x27;s biggest exporter of woodchips. At one stage it became Tasmania&#x27;s largest private land-owner. The company employed over 1,200 people and had suffered a dramatic turnaround in revenue in its final years, going from a turnover in excess of A$600 million in 2006, to a loss of over $350 million in 2011. Gunns was one of the largest export woodchip operation in the Southern Hemisphere, and one of two chip export companies sourcing raw materials from Tasmanian forests, the other being Neville Smith Forest Products through their SmartFiber branch in Bell Bay. Gunns announced a $900 million loss for 2011–12 and debts of $3 billion. On 25 September 2012, Gunns announced to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) that its board had decided to put the company into voluntary administration after its financier withdrew its support, and in March 2013 the company was placed into liquidation.

New Forests purchased the assets and employed former staff of the old company.

The move to expand its base into mainland operation began with the acquisition of Auspine in 2007. In September 2010, Gunns announced that it would end logging of old growth forests and move to plantation timber. In November 2011, the Gunns Mitre 10 stores were re-branded as Beck&#x27;s Home Timber and Hardware, after being sold to Danks Brothers Hardware Group, a subsidiary of Woolworths Limited.

Gunns was placed into voluntary administration on 25 September 2012, and later liquidated, after it was unable to raise further capital or restructure the business.

===Tasmania===
Gunns operated sawmills across the state, as well as three woodchipping mills: Longreach, near Bell Bay; Triabunna, on the east coast; and Hampshire, near Burnie. The company was forced to close all three woodchipping mills and most of its sawmills in 2011. After being placed into voluntary administration in 2012, the Longreach mill was reopened and began exporting woodchips for a time.

In 2008, operations at a sawmill in Scottsdale were restructured, resulting in the loss of 70 jobs. The sackings broke an agreement with the federal government, leading to the cancellation of substantial funding assistance. In the same year, around 135 workers at another Auspine sawmill at Tonganah lost their jobs after a softwood timber contract had gone to a competitor.

===Victoria===
In 2009, the company was awarded a contract to operate a new woodchip processing facility at Portland. The woodchipping mill was later sold off to Australian Bluegum Plantations in 2012, for $61.8 million.

===South Australia===
In South Australia the company managed blue gum plantations on Kangaroo Island. In Jamestown Gunns was a major customer of Morgan Sawmill.

Gunns bought the Tarpeena softwood sawmill from the now failed Forest Enterprises Australia, and which was later sold on to Timberlink.

===Western Australia===
Gunns operated three hardwood sawmills in Western Australia. Their nationwide product line of timber flooring included the hardwood, jarrah, found in the southwest of the state. The timber is reddish-brown when hewn and is, &quot;renowned for its beauty, warmth and durability&quot;. Their environmental initiatives included achieving certification under international standard ISO 14001:2004. Gunns supplied local trade and retail markets from its distribution yard in Welshpool, near Perth.

==Criticism==
The company has been the focus of criticism from environmentalists, primarily for its four woodchip mills which produce 4 million tonnes of chips for export annually. Green groups claim that native forests are harvested specifically for woodchipping, whereas Gunns claim that the majority of their chips come from residue from their sawmilling and veneer operations. Gunns&#x27; major customers are paper producers in Northern Asia, mainly Japan, including Mitsubishi, Nippon and Oji Paper. Gunns has also been criticised for its logging operations in the Styx Valley and for its use of 1080 poison to kill wildlife including protected species (baiting and particularly aerial spraying of forest prior to clearfelling).

In 1989, the chairman of Gunns, Edmund Rouse, unsuccessfully attempted to bribe a Labor Party member, Jim Cox, to cross the floor, which would have allowed the pro-logging Tasmanian government of premier Robin Gray and the Liberal Party to resume power. A Royal Commission followed and convicted Rouse. Robin Gray became director of Gunns Limited on 21 February 2000. He retired from the position in 2010.

Further allegations of corruption appeared when Paul Lennon, Premier of Tasmania, had his heritage home renovated by a Gunns-owned company at the height of Gunns&#x27; push for the Bell Bay Pulp Mill. Lennon refused to disclose how much he paid for the renovations.

===Bell Bay Pulp Mill===
The company was planning to build a $2 billion pulp mill in the Tamar Valley, near Launceston. The proposed mill would have used the Kraft process, Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching, and been fed with plantation eucalypt forest timber. The project was supported by the State Government for the perceived economic and employment benefits which were said to include $6.7 billion in spending over 25 years and 2000 temporary jobs created during the construction phase, but was opposed by environmental and social activist groups.
Federal Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull gave approval for the project on Wednesday 3 October 2007. This decision was however challenged by The Wilderness Society and later overturned on appeal due to alleged flaws discovered in the approval process.

===Gunns 20===
In the 2005 &quot;Gunns Limited v Marr &amp; Ors&quot; case, Gunns filed a writ in the Supreme Court of Victoria, against 20 individuals and organisations including Senator Bob Brown, for over A$7.8 million.

The original list of defendants were:

*Bob Brown - federal Greens senator (dropped December 2006)
*Simon Leo Brown - settled following certain undertakings not to protest
*Adam Burling - Huon Valley Environment Centre - dropped
*Brian Dimmick
*Doctors for Native Forests Inc. (Split off into separate action in November 2006 and settled as part of Nicklason apology)
*Heidi Douglas - The Wilderness Society (TWS). Settled in 2009 following certain undertakings not to protest.
*Neal Funnell. Settled in 2009 following self representation and limited undertakings not to protest.
*Helen Gee (dropped November 2006)
*Lou Geraghty
*Russell Hanson - TWS. Settled in 2007 following certain undertakings not to protest.
*the Huon Valley Environment Centre Inc.
*Geoff Law - TWS. Settled in September 2008 with damages of $15,000 awarded to Gunns.
*Alec Marr - TWS. Settled in May 2008 with damages of $45,000 and costs of $70,000 awarded to Gunns.
*Leanne Minshull - Settled with TWS 2008 agreement
*Louise Morris - Settled in 2009 following self representation limited undertakings not to protest.
*Ben Morrow. Settled in May 2008 with damages of $45,000 and costs of $70,000 awarded to Gunns.
*Frank Nicklason - Settled following written public apology from Nicklason withdrawing claims of legionella in woodchip piles.
*Peter Pullinger (dropped November 2006)
*Margaret (Peg) Putt - Greens MHA (dropped December 2006)
*The Wilderness Society Inc.Settled in May 2008 with damages of $45,000 and costs of $70,000 awarded to Gunns.

Gunns claims that the defendants have sullied its reputation and caused it to lose jobs and profits. The defendants claim that they are protecting the environment. The defendants have become collectively known as the &quot;Gunns 20&quot;.

Opponents and critics of the case have suggested that the writ was filed with the intent to discourage public criticism of the company, in a similar vein to a Strategic lawsuit against public participation, commonly used in North America, and the English McLibel case of McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants against environmental activists Helen Steel and David Morris over a pamphlet critical of the company. Gunns has maintained the position that they are merely trying to prevent parties enjoined to the writ from undertaking unlawful activities that disrupt their business. The statement of claim alleged incidents of assault against forestry workers and vandalism.

At a hearing before the Supreme Court of Victoria, an amended statement of claim lodged by the company and served on defendants on 1 July 2005 was dismissed. However, the judge in the case granted the company leave to lodge a third version of their statement of claim with the court no later than 15 August 2005.

The application continued before the court, before being brought to a close on 20 October 2006. In his ruling, The Honourable Justice Bongiorno, made an award of costs in favour of the respondents.

In November 2006, Gunns dropped the case against Helen Gee, Peter Pullinger and Doctors for Forests. In December 2006, it abandoned the claim against Greens MPs Bob Brown and Peg Putt. The other matters were all settled. A documentary about the case &quot;Defendant 5&quot; (by and about Heidi Douglas) has been shown on ABC and Al Jazeera.

===Redevelopment of Triabunna Woodchipping Mill===
In 2011, online travel entrepreneur Graeme Wood (Wotif.com) and outdoor wear entrepreneur Jan Cameron (Kathmandu) purchased the Triabunna Mill from Gunns for $10 million, out-maneuvering rival forest-related bids by providing prompt payment. Wood and Cameron, both wealthy environmentalists, planned to redevelop the site as an eco-friendly tourist resort or theme park. The instigator of the negotiations was Alec Marr, formerly head of the Wilderness Society. When Tony Abbott later became Prime Minister, he and Eric Abetz wanted to compulsorily acquire the mill for woodchipping. To forestall this plan, Alec Marr secretly recruited three ship welders and an electrician, and they smashed up the control room and other critical infrastructure, so that the mill could never be in operation again.

===Insider trading===
In August 2013, the former CEO John Gay, who had presided over much of Gunns&#x27; latter years (1986 to 2010) including its disastrous demise, was convicted of insider trading relating to his sale of company shares in December 2009 just prior to a shock announcement of a half-year profit collapse of 98%.

<doc id="1275948" wikidata="Q1292040" url="?curid=1275948" title="Operation Royal Marine">
<text>Operation Royal Marine was a military operation in May 1940 of the Second World War, during the Battle of France (10 May – 25 June 1940). The British floated fluvial mines down rivers which flowed into Germany from France. The plan was to destroy German bridges, barges and other water transport. After several postponements insisted on by the French government, fearful of German retaliation, the operation began on 10 May 1940, when the German offensive in the west began.

The mines caused some damage and delay to German river traffic on the Rhine from Karlsruhe to Koblenz and damaged bridges and protective barriers. Part of the plan was for Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers to drop the mines into rivers and canals on moonlit nights but this had hardly begun when the campaign ended. The success of the plot was nullified by the Allied defeat and the Franco-German Armistice of 22 June 1940.

==Background==
Despite the concerns of the French government during the Phoney War, over German air attacks and reprisals against French waterways, it was intended that the operation would take place simultaneously with Operation Wilfred, a scheme to mine the waters around Norway. The novelty of Operation Royal Marine was intended to divert American attention from the possible illegality of Operation Wilfred. Wilfred was to force German convoys transporting Swedish iron ore into international waters, where they could be attacked by the Royal Navy.

Simultaneous attacks with fluvial (river) mines against Germany was intended to deflect criticism that the Allies were not making war on Germany but the small countries around it, that they claimed to be protecting. A decision of the Anglo French Supreme War Council was taken on 28 March 1940 to commence Operation Royal Marine on 4 April and the air-dropping of mines on 15 April. The decision was vetoed shortly afterwards by the French War Committee, a ruling which was not rescinded for about three months. Operation Wilfred was left to take place on its own on 5 April and was then postponed to 8 April, later parts of the plan being cancelled when news arrived that the German fleet had sailed. The British and French were able to agree that Operation Royal Marine could begin as soon as the German offensive in the west commenced.

==Prelude==

===Plan===
The plan had been presented to the British Cabinet in November 1939 by Winston Churchill, as a means of retaliation against illegal German minelaying. (Sir Edward Spears claimed that he had originally proposed the idea to Churchill, when they visited eastern France in August 1939 but by the time the operation began, Churchill believed the idea to be his.) A stock of mines, with being produced per week, were to be put into rivers in France that flowed into western Germany, by naval parties led by Commander G. R. S. Wellby. The sailors were to be based in the Maginot Line, about distant from the Rhine, to put mines in the river, interfering with commercial traffic for beyond Karlsruhe.

The mines would sabotage barge traffic and other river craft but become inert before reaching neutral territory at the Netherlands border. On 6 March 1940, the Cabinet was notified that mines would be ready for release from riverbanks on 12 March and to be dropped by RAF bombers by mid-April, between Bingen am Rhein and Koblenz on moonlit nights. Neutrals were to be warned and the first mines were ready by the night of after French objections for fear of German retaliation, the plan was postponed. In April, Churchill tried to persuade the French to drop their objections to Royal Marine and remarked after meeting the French Prime Minister, Édouard Daladier, &quot;&quot;.

===Mines===
The mines were specially developed for the operation by Ministry of Defence 1 (MD1, &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Toyshop&quot;), a British weapon research and development organisation. The mine, known as the &#x27;W&#x27; Bomb, was designed by Millis Jefferis, who had received the request for the device on 10 November and had completed the first demonstration model by 24 November. A delayed-action fuze based on a soluble chemical pellet was devised by Jefferis&#x27; assistant, Stuart Macrae, using an Alka-Seltzer tablet, which was found to dissolve at a predictable rate. Each mine contained of Trinitrotoluene (TNT). Trials of the mines were carried out in the Thames in December 1939 and depending upon type, either floated or bounced along the riverbed. Because Jefferis&#x27; department only consisted of three people at the point, the trials had to be conducted with the help of a boat crewed by local Sea Scouts, who followed the mines after they had been dropped from Chiswick Bridge. Over 20,000 &#x27;W&#x27; Bombs were produced in the course of the war.

==Operation==

On 10 May 1940, mines were released into the Moselle to destroy pontoon bridges built by German army engineers; other mines were put into the Rhine to negligible effect. On 13 May, the British put in the Rhine near Soufflenheim, reported by General Victor Bourret, the Fifth Army commander, to have caused damage to the barge barrier protecting the bridge at Karlsruhe. Several pontoon bridges were damaged and river traffic was temporarily suspended between Karlsruhe and Mainz. By 24 May, over had been released into the Rhine, Moselle and Meuse rivers. On 9 June, André-Gaston Prételat, commander of 2, ordered the fluvial mines to be sent down the Rhine to delay a German attack on the Maginot Line. RAF Bomber Command mine dropping began between Bingen and Koblenz and into canals and river estuaries feeding the Heligoland Bight but few mines were laid by aircraft before the Battle of France ended; any damage caused could not be measured.

==Aftermath==

In &quot;Assignment to Catastrophe&quot; (1954), Edward Spears, the representative of Churchill to the French Prime Minister, who had first mooted the mining of German rivers in 1939, quoted Churchill from &quot;Their Finest Hour&quot; (1949) that,

<text>Pila, officially the Municipality of Pila (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 54,613 people.

The town of Pila is the site for some well-preserved houses dating back to the Spanish period as well as the old Saint Anthony of Padua Parish Church, the first Antonine church in the Philippines.

==History==

===Early history===
Pila and adjacent towns along the shores of Laguna de Bay are considered by archaeologists as one of the oldest settlements in the Philippines. The community is one of three such concentrations of population known archaeologically to have been in place before A.D. 1000. Archaeologists recovered in Pinagbayanan potteries and artifacts that indicate considerable settlement in the area during the Late Tang dynasty (900 A.D.). Archaeologists also recovered ancient horse bones ending the debate on whether the Spaniards brought them or not. The scientists were able to uncover Philippines’ oldest crematorium in the same area. It is worthwhile to note that the oldest Philippine document, the 900 A.D. Laguna Copperplate Inscription, mentioned Pila (as &quot;Pailah&quot;) twice and its ruler Jayadewa.
Pre-Hispanic Pila was one of the biggest barangay domains in Southern Luzon. Its leader was not only the local chief but also the regional datu. The bards of the shore towns of the Morong Peninsula across the lake from Pila sang of the exploits of Gat Salyan Maguinto, the “gold-rich” datu of Pila who extended his kingdom far and wide into their settlements. In fact, the greater territory was also called Pila. Wary of concentrating power on a noble Indio, the conquistadors later dismantled his realm and to avoid confusion, they changed the name of the Pila dependencies to Pililla, which means “minor Pila.” The original territory had encompassed the present towns of Morong (from which the town of Pililla or Pilang Morong separated in 1583); Baras (separated from Morong in 1588); Tanay (separated from Pililla in 1606); Jala-jala whose old name was also Pila (separated from Pililla in 1786) and Talim Island, which until now, has a sitio Pila. The descendants of Gat Salyan were also regarded as the founders of the other towns of the present province of Rizal.

Around 1375, due to some calamity of weather most probably flooding, the original seat of Pila had to be abandoned and the barangay transferred to Pagalangan, which signifies “the place of Reverence”. The Franciscan chronicler, Fray Juan Plasencia gathered that the datu of Pila, “ with his own gold” purchased the new site from another chief who had owned it and who thus moved to another place. The datu then farmed out the arable land among the nobles and the freemen who, in return, paid him an annual rent of a hundred ganta of rice

Even before the coming of the Spaniards, Pila was already noted for its spiritual ambiance. The center of the town was known as Pagalangan, which means “The Place of Reverence.”

===Spanish colonial era===

In 1571, the Spanish conquistadors, led by Don Juan de Salcedo, “discovered” Pila in Pagalangan after the “pacification” of Manila. On 14 November of the same year Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Spanish governor-general, awarded the &quot;encomienda &quot;(tributes) of Pagalangan and other Laguna villages to Don Francisco de Herrera, a &quot;regidor &quot;(councilman) of Manila. With the reorganization of the encomiendas in 1575, the tributes of Pila were granted to Don Hernando Ramirez on 29 July.

The Franciscans arrived in 1578 to evangelize the people of Pila and soon afterward built a church dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, the first Antonine house of worship in the Philippines. Due to the nobleness and mildness of the character of its inhabitants, the Spanish leadership honored the town with an exceptional title &quot;La Noble Villa de Pila&quot;, one of five villas named by the Spaniards in the 16th and 17th century in the Philippines. During this period, the demesne of Pila includes Victoria, Laguna, and Jala-Jala, Rizal.
The Franciscans established in Pila the second printing press in the Philippines in 1611 under the auspices of Tomas Pinpin and Domingo Loag. The press printed in 1613, the Philippines’ oldest dictionary and the first book printed using the movable type, the &quot;Vocabulario de Lengua Tagala&quot;. The book was written and compiled by Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura and printed by Tomas Pinpin, the Prince of Filipino printers. The book is twenty-seven years older than the Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in the United States in 1640.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the town was transferred from Pagalangan to the present site of Santa Clara because of perennial flooding.

===Post-colonial era===
In 1949, the barrios of Bancabanca, Daniw, Masapang, Nanhaya, San Benito, San Felix, San Francisco, and San Roque were excised from Pila to form the new independent municipality of Victoria, by virtue of Executive Order No. 282.

In 1957, the sitio of Pinagbayanan was converted into a barrio, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1689.

== Economy ==
Pila is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. 
==Tourism==

The National Historical Institute of the Philippines (now National Historical Commission of the Philippines) declared the town plaza and surrounding ancestral houses a National Historical Landmark on May 17, 2000, by NHI Resolution no. 2, series of 2002. It cited Pila as an early pre-Hispanic center of culture and trade in Laguna known as &quot;La Noble Villa de Pila&quot; and has been recognized as one of the country&#x27;s more important archeological sites where clay potteries were discovered in excavations made in Pinagbayanan in 1967. The historic town of Pila is bounded by General Luna Street in the north, M. H. del Pilar Street in the east, Mabini Street in the south, and Bonifacio Street in the west, and including the Pila Elementary School, and the Juan Fuentes and Santiago Fernandez house.

Two years later, on July 9, 2002, the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Pablo proclaimed the parish church of San Antonio de Padua de Pila as the Diocesan Shrine of St. Anthony. According to Philippine historian, Dr. Luciano Santiago, it is the only town in the Philippines that is formally recognized as a historical site by both the church and the state.

=== National Shrine of San Antonio de Padua ===

Formerly San Antonio de Padua Parish Church, the original Pila church was built in Pagalangan in the 1578 with Rev. Juan de Florencia serving as its first priest. The whole structure, including the convent, was completed in 1618. The church was then transferred to its present location at the town square in 1800 due to frequent flooding in the original town center. Transfer and reconstruction of the church was finished along with the convent in 1849. Both however, were severely damaged by an earthquake in 1880. It was once more built in the early 19th century after the damage caused by the earthquake. The church was luckily spared from the ravages of WWII.

Pila Church is among the Newest churches in Laguna. This is evident in its strong stone structure. Its red bell tower is one of its distinguishable features. The church is dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and it was declared by the Pontificate of Pope John Paul II as the Diocesan Shrine of the said saint on July 9, 2002. Inside, wood is prominently seen as the material of choice for the chairs and altar. The altar is a massive structure that holds a relic of St. Anthony&#x27;s garment.

=== Pila Museum ===
Pila Museum is one of the Municipal Museums in Laguna—the other one being in Paete. The museum is under the direct jurisdiction of the office of the mayor of Pila. It was built through the efforts of the Pila Historical Society Foundation, a group of concerned citizens that seek to preserve the cultural heritage of Pila. The museum was built on November 10, 1993, from funds raised by the foundation. The foundation was also responsible for securing the declaration of the town as a National Historical Landmark, which was granted in the year 2000. The declaration was formalized by the installation of a landmark in the middle of the open field adjacent to the museum on December 4, 2007, with former President Ramos as the guest of honor.

It occupies a part of the Pila Elementary School with an area of about 50 square meters. The majority of what is contained within are artifacts dating from the Chinese period like jars, plates and jugs. The rest of the exhibit consist of American period appliances like sewing machines, Bakelite telephones, and adding machines. Most of the Chinese period artifacts were dug from the Pinagbayanan Crematorium while others were donated by old families in the town.

The Elizalde family donated 250–300 specimens to the Pila museum—with the museum also donated by them. The contents of the museum were transferred to a heritage building in 1994. Some of the specimens given are the following:
* Celadon Dishes with fish motifs
* Qingbai and blue and white jarlets
* Lead-glazed water droppers and teapots
* Carabao figurines
* Brown wares
* Iron and glass bracelets
* Gold or copper colored beads and earrings

=== Old Ancestral Houses ===

It is a common misconception that the old ancestral houses are Hispanic in design. According to the town&#x27;s curator and tourism officer however, these houses were built during the early American period. A number of them are still in pristine condition, preserved by the descendants of the original owners of the house while some are converted into shops and cafés. A majority of the houses within the site are derelict but the town officials are taking action to restore these architectural treasures.

Some of the old ancestral houses:
* Casto Maceda / Concha Monserrat house
* Corazon Rivera House
* Jose Agra / Rosario Villarica house
* Teodora Alava House

==Culture==
===Pop culture===
In the popular culture, the town served as the location for the reality show, &quot;The Amazing Race Asia 2&quot; of AXN, including daytime drama hit series &quot;Be Careful With My Heart,&quot; and primetime series &quot;Huwag Kang Mangamba&quot; both from the now-defunct ABS-CBN.

==Government==
===Municipal Hall===

The Pila Municipal Hall is a small and quaint structure right in front of the Pila Church. It is distinguishable by its white paint scheme with red tiled roof and brown pillars. Outside is a statue of Rizal standing guard in memoriam to the national hero. The hall has been situated there since 1931 and has been renovated time and again.

The open field in front of the hall serves as a waiting spots for those with appointments to the mayor or any public official. Parking space is adequate and tricycles parked near the hall can be easily hailed to go about town.

As with any municipal hall, it houses the local post office, the assessor&#x27;s office, the local internal revenue office, and health center. Unlike most municipal halls, the office of the Tourism officer is not located within but is stationed at the Pila Museum.

== Archaeology ==

Esso Standard Philippines and Elizalde Family Project funded an archaeological project along Laguna de Bay. It was supervised by Dr. Robert Fox and Mr. Avelino Legaspi of the Anthropology Department of the National Museum.

In total, there were ten excavations from May to October 1967. Talim Island, Balibago, and Rizal were the first to be excavated. It was followed by Pinagbayanan and Bagong Pook. Pila and Lumban were the last site to be excavated. Three of the four sites mentioned exposed 153 graves aging from the 12th to 15th century.

=== Access to trade ===
As a place situated along Laguna de Bay, Pila was an accessible area for foreign trade. Vessels filled with merchants carrying goods and services traded with the locals for their products.

Since Laguna de Bay is connected to Manila Bay, the geographical area covered by the trade before was wide.

The items retrieved from the area were of very good quality and expensive looking. This indicates that the people that once lived in Pila were wealthy.

=== Cremation activities ===
Professor Henry Otley Beyer pointed out that cremation was once practiced in Novaliches. In Pila&#x27;s case, the team members found traces of cremation practice in the site. In their data, 40% of the cremated remains were found to be buried in soil and the remaining 60% were found in medium-sized jars.

In Pinagbayanan, the cremation burials were secondary burials. In the first phase, the body is let alone to decompose. It is then followed by a ritual performance. The body is burned because, according to the belief of ancient people, the “spirit is as clean as though washed in gold&quot; once the body is set on fire.

=== Stratigraphy of the Pinagbayanan Excavation ===
Six major layers:
# Thin humus level of light brown soil, banana trees and young coconut trees are planted
# Compact, fine-grained, gray-brown, 10 cm thickness. No cultural materials found in this layer.
# Soft black loam rich with organic material, 15–20 cm below the surface. Sherds were also found here. Also, cremation burials and postholes were found, that is why it is thought of that this area was home for the ancient people and burial site. Animal remains of pigs and horses were recovered. A C14 date of 1375+-25 bp was obtained on a ceremonial burial.
# Medium-grained, reddish-brown, and sandy clay found in here shows that it is a burial ground. The fourth level is 85 centimeters.
# Compact, fine-grained, and sandy clay. Dated as part of the Iron Age.
# Water table and stable natural soil.

<text>Avraham Mordechai Alter (, Yiddish: Avram Mordche Alter, ; 25 December 1865 – 13 June 1948), was also known as the Imrei Emes after the works he authored. He was fourth Rebbe of the Hasidic dynasty of Ger. The Ger Rebbe, from 1905 until his death in 1948. A participant in the foundation of the Agudas Israel in Poland. Rebbe Alter was influential in establishing a network of Jewish schools. He led over two-hundred-thousand Hasidim (followers).

==Personal life==
Rebbe Alter married his first wife, Chaya Ruda Czarna. Rebbe Alter and his first wife had eight children. She was daughter of Noah Czarny, a prominent Gerrer Hasid in Biala. Rabbi Meir Alter, was a Torah scholar and businessman, the eldest son. The second son was Rabbi Yitzchak Alter. The second son, died in 1934 in Poland. Rabbi Meir, the eldest, was murdered in Treblinka, along with all of his offspring and their children, all perished. This was during the Holocaust.

In 1922, Rebbe Alter&#x27;s wife Chaya Ruda died. Feyge Mintshe Biderman was his next wife, who also was his niece. By 1926 the youngest child, Pinchas Menachem Alter, was born.

In 1924, Rebbe Alter accompanied the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah delegation which visited Palestine. It included Rabbi Hirsh Heynekh Lewin, who was his brother in-law, Yitzhak-Meir Levin who also was his son-in-law, along with the Sokolover Rebbe Yitzchak Zelig Morgenstern, and several other distinguished rabbis and rebbes. They visited Jerusalem, Safed, Hebron, Tiberias and Tel Aviv. This was a more than six week visit. 

==World War II==
During World War II, Rebbe Alter was targeted by the Nazi authorities in occupied Poland. In 1940, he managed to escape Nazi Poland. Rebbe Alter made it to Palestine with several of his sons. He rebuilt the Ger Hasidic dynasty in Palestine. This became the Sfas Emes Yeshiva, and he remained from 1940 until his death in 1948.

==Death and legacy==
With the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Alter was trapped in Jerusalem. He died during the holiday of Shavuot of natural causes during the siege of the city by the Jordanian Arab Legion. As bodies could not be removed to the Mount of Olives during wartime, he was buried in the yeshiva courtyard on the condition that he would be reburied elsewhere after the war. However, his sons and successors, the Beis Yisrael and Lev Simcha, declined to go through with the reburial.

After Alter&#x27;s death, the dynasty continued with his three remaining sons, who became the consecutive next three heads of the Gerrer Hasidim worldwide: Rabbi Yisrael Alter (fifth rebbe of Ger); Rabbi Simchah Bunim Alter (sixth rebbe of Ger); and Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter (seventh rebbe of Ger). In 1996, Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter was buried next to his father in the courtyard and a red-brick ohel was placed over both graves, which are visited regularly by students in the adjoining yeshiva.

The Hebrew acronym for Rabbi Avraham Mordechai is &quot;Re&#x27;em (). A religious moshav in central Israel is named for the Rebbe, Bnei Re&#x27;em, (&quot;lit.&quot; Sons of Re&#x27;em) as well as the nearby junction of highway 40 and highway 3.

<doc id="1275964" wikidata="Q744417" url="?curid=1275964" title="Italo disco">
<text>Italo disco (variously capitalized, and sometimes hyphenated as Italo-disco) is a music genre which originated in Italy in the late 1970s and was mainly produced in the 1980s. Italo disco evolved from the then-current underground dance, pop, and electronic music, both domestic and foreign (hi-NRG, Euro disco) and developed into a diverse genre. The genre employs electronic drums, drum machines, synthesizers, and occasionally vocoders. It is usually sung in English, and to a lesser extent in Italian and Spanish.

The origin of the genre&#x27;s name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982. Italo disco faded in the early 1990s, then split into many genres (Eurobeat, Italo house, Italo dance).

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Italo&quot;, a generic prefix meaning Italian, had been used on pop music compilation albums in West Germany as early as 1978, such as &quot;Italo Top Hits&quot; on the K-Tel label and the first volume of &quot;Italo Super Hits&quot; on the Ariola label.

There is no documentation of where the term &quot;Italo-Disco&quot; first appeared, but its origins are generally traced to Italian and other European disco recordings released in the West German market. Examples include the phrase &quot;Original Italo-Disco&quot; on the sleeve of the West German edition of &quot;Girls on Me&quot; by Amin-Peck in 1982, and the 1983 compilation album &quot;The Best of Italo-Disco&quot;. These records, along with the &quot;Italo Boot Mix&quot; megamix, were released by Bernhard Mikulski on his ZYX label, who was therefore credited with coining the term &quot;Italo disco&quot;. The &quot;Best of&quot; and &quot;Boot Mix&quot; compilations each became a 16-volume series that culminated in 1991. Both series primarily featured disco music of Italian origin, often licensed from independent Italian labels which had limited distribution outside Italy, as well as songs in a similar style by other European artists.

The presenters of the Italian music show &quot;Discoring&quot; (produced by RAI) usually referred to Italo disco tracks as &quot;rock elettronico&quot; (electronic rock) or &quot;balli da discoteca&quot; (disco dance) before the term &quot;Italo disco&quot; came into existence.

==History==
===Origins: 1977–1990===

Italo disco originated in Europe in the late 1970s. After Disco Demolition Night in 1979, American interest in disco sharply declined, whereas in Europe the genre maintained mainstream popularity and survived into the 1980s.

The adoption of synthesizers and other electronic instruments by disco artists led to electronic dance music, which spawned many subgenres such as hi-NRG in America and space disco in Europe. Italo disco&#x27;s influences include Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, French musician Didier Marouani, Italo-French drummer Cerrone, and the San Francisco-based hi-NRG producer Patrick Cowley, who worked with singers as Sylvester and Paul Parker.

In the late 1970s, Italo disco group D.D. Sound (La Bionda) released the song &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, Gimme Some More&quot;. In 1979, Jacques Fred Petrus and Mauro Malavasi created the soulful post-disco groups Change and B.B. &amp; Q. Band. In 1981, both groups gained US R&amp;B and Dance hits with &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;On the Beat&quot; respectively.

Italo disco often features electronic sounds, electronic drums, drum machines, catchy melodies, vocoders, overdubs, and heavily accented English lyrics. By 1983, Italo disco&#x27;s instrumentation was predominantly electronic. Along with love, Italo disco themes deal with robots and space, sometimes combining all three in songs like &quot;Robot Is Systematic&quot; (1982) by Lectric Workers and &quot;Spacer Woman&quot; (1983) by Charlie.In 1983, there were frequent hit singles, and labels such as American Disco, Crash, Merak, Sensation and X-Energy appeared. The popular label Discomagic Records released more than thirty singles within the year. It was also the year that the term &quot;Italo disco&quot; became widely known outside Italy, with the release of the first volumes of &quot;The Best of Italo Disco&quot; compilation series on the West German record label ZYX. After 1983, Italo disco was also produced outside Italy.

Although Italo disco was successful in mainland Europe during the 1980s, only a few singles reached the UK charts, such as Ryan Paris&#x27;s &quot;Dolce Vita&quot;, Laura Branigan&#x27;s &quot;Self Control&quot;, Baltimora&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot;, Spagna&#x27;s &quot;Call Me&quot; and Sabrina&#x27;s &quot;Boys&quot;, all of which were top 5 hits. Italo disco maintained an influence in the UK&#x27;s underground music scenes in the UK, and its impact can be heard in the music of several British electronic acts such as the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and New Order.
===Derivative styles===

Canada, particularly Quebec, produced several remarkable Italo disco acts, including Trans X (&quot;Living on Video&quot;), Lime (&quot;Angel Eyes&quot;), Rational Youth (&quot;City of Night&quot;), Pluton &amp; the Humanoids (&quot;World Invaders&quot;), Purple Flash Orchestra (&quot;We Can Make It&quot;), and Tapps (&quot;Forbidden Lover&quot;). Those productions were called &quot;Canadian disco&quot; during 1980–1984 in Europe and hi-NRG disco in the U.S.

In English-speaking countries, it was called Italo disco and hi-NRG. In Mexico the style is known just as &quot;disco&quot;, having nothing to do with the 1970s genre. West German productions were sung in English and were characterized by an emphasis on melody, exaggerated production, and a more earnest approach to the themes of love; examples may be found in the works of: Modern Talking, Fancy, American-born singer and Fancy protégé Grant Miller, Bad Boys Blue, Joy, Silent Circle, the Twins, Lian Ross, C. C. Catch, Blue System and London Boys.

During the mid-1980s, spacesynth, a derivation of Italo disco, developed. It was mostly instrumental, featured space sounds, and was exemplified by musicians, such as: Koto, Proxyon, Rofo, Cyber People, Hipnosis, Laserdance and Mike Mareen (whose music inhabited the spacesynth/hi-NRG overlap). 

===Eurobeat===

As Italo disco declined in Europe, Italian and West German producers adapted the sound to Japanese tastes, creating &quot;Eurobeat&quot;. Music produced in this style is sold exclusively in Japan due to the country&#x27;s Para Para culture, produced by Italian producers for the Japanese market. The two most famous Eurobeat labels are A-Beat-C Records and Time Records. One traditional Italo disco label, S.A.I.F.A.M., still produces Eurobeat music for Japan.

Around 1989 in Italy, Italo disco evolved into Italo house when Italian Italo disco artists experimented with harder beats and the &quot;house&quot; sound.

==Related styles and legacy==
===Space disco===
Space disco is a type of dance music using synthesizers and space-like sounds and themes.

At least one modern history of &quot;space disco&quot; traces the genre&#x27;s origins to science fiction themes (outer space, robots, and the future) in the titles, lyrics and cover artwork of dance music in the late 1970s. Plausible associations are drawn between the popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (released mid-1977), the subsequent surge of interest in science fiction themes in popular culture, and the release of a number of science fiction themed and &quot;futuristic&quot;-sounding (synthesizer and arpeggiator-infused) disco music worldwide. The most commercially successful space disco tracks were &quot;Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band&quot; (1977) by Meco, and &quot;Automatic Lover&quot; (1978) by Dee D. Jackson, with each song reaching the top ten in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom.
Additional examples of space disco usually include the compositions &quot;Just Blue&quot; and &quot;Symphony&quot; (both 1978) of French band Space, the same for the track Magic Fly; additional tracks by Dee D. Jackson during the 1970s and 1980s, and &quot;I Feel Space&quot; by Lindstrøm.

Labels producing this type of music include
* Whatever We Want Records (Brooklyn, NY, US)
* Feedelity (run by Lindstrøm) (Europe)
* Eskimo , Bear Entertainment/Bear Funk, Prins Thomas&#x27; Full Pupp (Belgium)
* Tirk (UK) and D. C. Recordings (UK).

===Post-disco and house music===
New York City-based post-disco record label Emergency Records specialized in reissuing/selling records from Italy (e.g. Kano &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;), since the 1970s. Kano is noted for incorporating American musical elements (&quot;heavy funk&quot; influences, &quot;breakbeat&quot; rhythm, the use of vocoder) with electronic music while using rudimentary synthesizers, constituting one of the earliest forms of Italo disco. This form of Americanized Italo disco, that also includes Klein + M.B.O. (&quot;Dirty Talk&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot;, &quot;The M. B. O. Theme&quot;), re-entered the States and was known to be influential on the development of house music. Doctor&#x27;s Cat (&quot;Feel the Drive&quot;), likewise, was one of the earliest &quot;house music&quot; songs.

Record labels include
* Emergency Records (NYC, US; 1980s)

<text>Ronald Henry Bowden (born 20 July 1942) is an Australian politician. He was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1992 until 2006, representing South Eastern Province.

He was born in Sydney, and studied at PMG Engineering College and Sydney Technical College, before spending time in the United States studying at the General Electric Executive Staff College. Bowden worked with General Electric from 1965 to 1984, serving in several marketing, sales and management positions, and then as a state manager for ASEA Australia from 1984 to 1986. He has also served as a director with numerous companies.

Bowden became involved in politics during the early 1990s, serving as vice-president of his local party branch in 1992, before securing Liberal Party pre-selection to contest the safe Liberal Legislative Council seat of South Eastern Province. He has been a low-profile member of the Legislative Council, though he has actively campaigned for improved transport options in his electorate, such as the improvement of the dilapidated Stony Point railway line. He also served on the Economic Development Committee from 1996 to 1999, and on the Law Reform Committee from 2000 to 2002.

Though he was easily re-elected in 1999, Bowden came under increasing pressure during his second term to resign and make way for a younger replacement. In August 2005, Bowden made the announcement that he would stand down at the 2006 state election to take up &quot;an invitation from the international business community.&quot;

In September 2008 he was elected to the Committee of the Australian American Association (Vic).

<doc id="1275975" wikidata="Q591877" url="?curid=1275975" title="Disruptive selection">
<text>In evolutionary biology, disruptive selection, also called diversifying selection, describes changes in population genetics in which extreme values for a trait are favored over intermediate values. In this case, the variance of the trait increases and the population is divided into two distinct groups. In this more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both ends of the distribution curve.

== Overview ==
Natural selection is known to be one of the most important biological processes behind evolution. There are many variations of traits, and some cause greater or lesser reproductive success of the individual. The effect of selection is to promote certain alleles, traits, and individuals that have a higher chance to survive and reproduce in their specific environment. Since the environment has a carrying capacity, nature acts on this mode of selection on individuals to let only the most fit offspring survive and reproduce to their full potential. The more advantageous the trait is the more common it will become in the population. Disruptive selection is a specific type of natural selection that actively selects against the intermediate in a population, favoring both extremes of the spectrum.

Disruptive selection is inferred to oftentimes lead to sympatric speciation through a phyletic gradualism mode of evolution. Disruptive selection can be caused or influenced by multiple factors and also have multiple outcomes, in addition to speciation. Individuals within the same environment can develop a preference for extremes of a trait, against the intermediate. Selection can act on having divergent body morphologies in accessing food, such as beak and dental structure. It is seen that often this is more prevalent in environments where there is not a wide clinal range of resources, causing heterozygote disadvantage or selection favoring homozygotes.

Niche partitioning allows for selection of differential patterns of resource usage, which can drive speciation. To the contrast, niche conservation pulls individuals toward ancestral ecological traits in an evolutionary tug-of-war. Also, nature tends to have a &#x27;jump on the band wagon&#x27; perspective when something beneficial is found. This can lead to the opposite occurring with disruptive selection eventually selecting against the average; when everyone starts taking advantage of that resource it will become depleted and the extremes will be favored. Furthermore, gradualism is a more realistic view when looking at speciation as compared to punctuated equilibrium.

Disruptive selection can initially rapidly intensify divergence; this is because it is only manipulating alleles that already exist. Often it is not creating new ones by mutation which takes a long time. Usually complete reproductive isolation does not occur until many generations, but behavioral or morphological differences separate the species from reproducing generally. Furthermore, generally hybrids have reduced fitness which promotes reproductive isolation.

== Example ==
Suppose there is a population of rabbits. The colour of the rabbits is governed by two incompletely dominant traits: black fur, represented by &quot;B&quot;, and white fur, represented by &quot;b&quot;. A rabbit in this population with a genotype of &quot;BB&quot; would have a phenotype of black fur, a genotype of &quot;Bb&quot; would have grey fur (a display of both black and white), and a genotype of &quot;bb&quot; would have white fur.

If this population of rabbits occurred in an environment that had areas of black rocks as well as areas of white rocks, the rabbits with black fur would be able to hide from predators amongst the black rocks, and the rabbits with white fur likewise amongst the white rocks. The rabbits with grey fur, however, would stand out in all areas of the habitat, and would thereby suffer greater predation.

As a consequence of this type of selective pressure, our hypothetical rabbit population would be disruptively selected for extreme values of the fur colour trait: white or black, but not grey. This is an example of underdominance (heterozygote disadvantage) leading to disruptive selection.

==Sympatric speciation==
It is believed that disruptive selection is one of the main forces that drive sympatric speciation in natural populations. The pathways that lead from disruptive selection to sympatric speciation seldom are prone to deviation; such speciation is a domino effect that depends on the consistency of each distinct variable. These pathways are the result of disruptive selection in intraspecific competition; it may cause reproductive isolation, and finally culminate in sympatric speciation.

It is important to keep in mind that disruptive selection does not always have to be based on intraspecific competition. It is also important to know that this type of natural selection is similar to the other ones. Where it is not the major factor, intraspecific competition can be discounted in assessing the operative aspects of the course of adaptation. For example, what may drive disruptive selection instead of intraspecific competition might be polymorphisms that lead to reproductive isolation, and thence to speciation.

When disruptive selection is based on intraspecific competition, the resulting selection in turn promotes ecological niche diversification and polymorphisms. If multiple morphs (phenotypic forms) occupy different niches, such separation could be expected to promote reduced competition for resources. Disruptive selection is seen more often in high density populations rather than in low density populations because intraspecific competition tends to be more intense within higher density populations. This is because higher density populations often imply more competition for resources. The resulting competition drives polymorphisms to exploit different niches or changes in niches in order to avoid competition. If one morph has no need for resources used by another morph, then it is likely that neither would experience pressure to compete or interact, thereby supporting the persistence and possibly the intensification of the distinctness of the two morphs within the population. This theory does not necessarily have a lot of supporting evidence in natural populations, but it has been seen many times in experimental situations using existing populations. These experiments further support that, under the right situations (as described above), this theory could prove to be true in nature.

When intraspecific competition is not at work disruptive selection can still lead to sympatric speciation and it does this through maintaining polymorphisms. Once the polymorphisms are maintained in the population, if assortative mating is taking place, then this is one way that disruptive selection can lead in the direction of sympatric speciation. If different morphs have different mating preferences then assortative mating can occur, especially if the polymorphic trait is a &quot;magic trait&quot;, meaning a trait that is under ecological selection and in turn has a side effect on reproductive behavior. In a situation where the polymorphic trait is &quot;not&quot; a magic trait then there has to be some kind of fitness penalty for those individuals who do not mate assortatively and a mechanism that causes assortative mating has to evolve in the population. For example, if a species of butterflies develops two kinds of wing patterns, crucial to mimicry purposes in their preferred habitat, then mating between two butterflies of different wing patterns leads to an unfavorable heterozygote. Therefore, butterflies will tend to mate with others of the same wing pattern promoting increased fitness, eventually eliminating the heterozygote altogether. This unfavorable heterozygote generates pressure for a mechanism that cause assortative mating which will then lead to reproductive isolation due to the production of post-mating barriers. It is actually fairly common to see sympatric speciation when disruptive selection is supporting two morphs, specifically when the phenotypic trait affects fitness rather than mate choice.

In both situations, one where intraspecific competition is at work and the other where it is not, if all these factors are in place, they will lead to reproductive isolation, which can lead to sympatric speciation.

== Significance ==

Disruptive selection is of particular significance in the history of evolutionary study, as it is involved in one of evolution&#x27;s &quot;cardinal cases&quot;, namely the finch populations observed by Darwin in the Galápagos.
He observed that the species of finches were similar enough to ostensibly have been descended from a single species. However, they exhibited disruptive variation in beak size. This variation appeared to be adaptively related to the seed size available on the respective islands (big beaks for big seeds, small beaks for small seeds). Medium beaks had difficulty retrieving small seeds and were also not tough enough for the bigger seeds, and were hence maladaptive.

While it is true that disruptive selection can lead to speciation, this is not as quick or straightforward of a process as other types of speciation or evolutionary change. This introduces the topic of gradualism, which is a slow but continuous accumulation of changes over long periods of time. This is largely because the results of disruptive selection are less stable than the results of directional selection (directional selection favors individuals at only one end of the spectrum).

For example, let us take the mathematically straightforward yet biologically improbable case of the rabbits: Suppose directional selection were taking place. The field only has dark rocks in it, so the darker the rabbit, the more effectively it can hide from predators. Eventually there will be a lot of black rabbits in the population (hence many &quot;B&quot; alleles) and a lesser amount of grey rabbits (who contribute 50% chromosomes with &quot;B&quot; allele and 50% chromosomes with &quot;b&quot; allele to the population). There will be few white rabbits (not very many contributors of chromosomes with &quot;b&quot; allele to the population). This could eventually lead to a situation in which chromosomes with &quot;b&quot; allele die out, making black the only possible color for all subsequent rabbits. The reason for this is that there is nothing &quot;boosting&quot; the level of &quot;b&quot; chromosomes in the population. They can only go down, and eventually die out.

Consider now the case of disruptive selection. The result is equal numbers of black and white rabbits, and hence equal numbers of chromosomes with &quot;B&quot; or &quot;b&quot; allele, still floating around in that population. Every time a white rabbit mates with a black one, only gray rabbits results. So, in order for the results to &quot;click&quot;, there needs to be a force causing white rabbits to choose other white rabbits, and black rabbits to choose other black ones. In the case of the finches, this &quot;force&quot; was geographic/niche isolation. This leads one to think that disruptive selection cannot happen and is normally because of species being geographically isolated, directional selection or by stabilising selection.

<text>In mathematics, the Seifert conjecture states that every nonsingular, continuous vector field on the 3-sphere has a closed orbit. It is named after Herbert Seifert. In a 1950 paper, Seifert asked if such a vector field exists, but did not phrase non-existence as a conjecture. He also established the conjecture for perturbations of the Hopf fibration.

The conjecture was disproven in 1974 by Paul Schweitzer, who exhibited a formula_1 counterexample. Schweitzer&#x27;s construction was then modified by Jenny Harrison in 1988 to make a formula_2 counterexample for some formula_3. The existence of smoother counterexamples remained an open question until 1993 when Krystyna Kuperberg constructed a very different formula_4 counterexample. Later this construction was shown to have real analytic and piecewise linear versions.
In 1997 for the particular case of incompressible fluids it was shown that all formula_5 steady state flows on formula_6 possess closed flowlines based on similar results for Beltrami flows on the Weinstein conjecture.

<text>The Lebanese University (LU; ) is the only state-funded public university in Lebanon. It was established in 1951.

The university&#x27;s main campus was originally located in Beirut, but a few satellite campuses were opened due to travel restrictions during the Lebanese Civil War. It has three main campuses: Rafic Hariri Campus, Fanar Campus and North Campus. The Roumieh campus, which features a faculty of engineering, is one of the satellite campuses.

The university currently enrolls thousands of students and is organized into 16 faculties. It offers a range of degree programs, include undergraduate, graduate and doctoral levels. The primary language of instruction is Arabic.

== History ==
The creation of the Lebanese University was an idea first mentioned in the speech of the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hamid Frangieh, during the closing ceremony of the Third UNESCO Conference in Beirut held on 11 December 1948, during which he said: &quot;Lebanon hopes to see the creation of a Lebanese university having the spirit of UNESCO.&quot;

The establishment of the Lebanese University came as a result of a popular and student mobilization initiated on 23 January 1951 with a general strike that lasted for a long period during which, secondary and university students, mostly from Saint Joseph University participated. The movement included demonstrations and clashes with security forces that lead the Council of Ministers to meet on 5 February of the same year.

== University presidents ==
Since its inception, the Lebanese University has been headed by:

and it has been headed by Bassam Badran since 2021.

== Faculties and campuses ==
The university issued successive decrees since its inception, establishing faculties and institutes, which contributed to its expansion and development until reaching 16 faculties:
In addition to three Doctoral Schools:
The university is also affiliated with the Institute of Applied Sciences and Economics (CNAM-ISAE), which operates in cooperation with CNAM in France.

== Honorary doctorates ==
The university awarded honorary doctorates to a number of heads of state and officials, including in chronological order:

In 2009, the Lebanese University started awarding honorary doctorates to Lebanese personalities.

== Mission ==
The Lebanese University is the only public institution in Lebanon carrying out the functions of the public higher education with its various majors and degrees, scientific research, and continuous training.

== Rankings and reputation ==

In the 2024 QS World University Rankings, the Lebanese University ranks 577 worldwide, a record-high after being placed 701–750 in 2021.

<doc id="1275984" wikidata="Q1863109" url="?curid=1275984" title="On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation">
<text>On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (19 April 1817) is a book by David Ricardo on economics. The book concludes that land rent grows as population increases. It also presents the theory of comparative advantage, the theory that free trade between two or more countries can be mutually beneficial, even when one country has an absolute advantage over the other countries in all areas of production.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Ricardo grew weary of the Corn Laws, a tax imposed on wheat by the British that made it impossible to import wheat from the rest of Europe. Ricardo, despite his wealth, supported those who could no longer afford grains and bread once the price floor was in effect to support farmers. In his argument, for what is now free trade, Ricardo highlights the idea that if a country can get a good from another country at a lower cost, it would behoove a country to source that item from the cheaper producing country than to produce the good locally. “To produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labour of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the same country, might require the labour of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth.” Ricardo&#x27;s theory demonstrates that a country, when choosing between two goods to produce and trade, could still achieve an advantage by focusing on the good requiring fewer resources to produce, even if the country does not have an absolute advantage in that good. This allows countries with an absolute advantage in multiple goods, or with no absolute advantage at all, to still benefit from international trade.

Ricardo claims in the preface that Turgot, James Steuart, Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, Sismondi, and others had not written enough &quot;satisfactory information&quot; on the topics of rent, profit, and wages. &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; is Ricardo&#x27;s effort to fill that gap in the literature. Regardless of whether the book achieved that goal, it secured, according to Ronald Max Hartwell, Ricardo&#x27;s position among the great classical economists Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx.

In his book &quot;Adam&#x27;s Fallacy: A Guide to Economic Theology&quot;, economist Duncan K. Foley highlights that in the &quot;Principles&quot; Ricardo criticizes Adam Smith&#x27;s treatment of the theory of value and distribution for circular reasoning, in particular as far as concerns rent, and that Ricardo considers the labor theory of value, properly understood, a more logically sound basis for political economic reasoning.

Foley also discusses the chapter &quot;On Machinery&quot;, which Ricardo included in his third and final (1821) version of &quot;Principles&quot;. Here Ricardo famously analysed the impact of the adoption of machinery on the different classes of society, revising his earlier view that mechanization could be expected to be of benefit to each of the classes of the society. The increase in productivity due to mechanization lowers the production costs and thus also the real prices of commodities. Whereas the landowning class and capitalists benefit from the lower prices, workers in contrast do not reap such benefit from the lower prices if capitalists reduce the wage fund in order to finance the expensive machinery, causing technological unemployment among workers. In this case, Ricardo points out, wages are forced down by competition among workers, and the introduction of new machines can lead to an overall decline in the well-being of the working class.

<text>Câmpulung Moldovenesc (; formerly spelled &quot;Cîmpulung Moldovenesc&quot;) is a city in Suceava County, northeastern Romania. It is situated in the historical region of Bukovina.

Câmpulung Moldovenesc is the fourth largest urban settlement in the county, with a population of 15,642 inhabitants, according to the 2021 census. It was declared a municipality in 1995, along with two other towns in Suceava County, more specifically Fălticeni and Rădăuți. Câmpulung Moldovenesc covers an area of and it was the capital of former Câmpulung County (until 1950).

== Name ==
&quot;Câmpulung&quot; means &quot;Long Field&quot; in Romanian. Moldovenesc (&quot;Moldavian&quot;) is used to differentiate between this town and Câmpulung Muscel (Argeș County, Wallachia). The town is also known as &quot;Moldovahosszúmező&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;Kimpolung&quot; or &quot;Kimpulung&quot; in German, &quot;Kimpulung Moldovanesk&quot; (Кимпулунг Молдованеск) or &quot;Dovhopillja&quot; (Довгопілля) in Ukrainian, and &quot;Kimpulung Mołdawski&quot; in Polish.

== Geography ==
Câmpulung Moldovenesc is situated in the region of Bukovina, in north-eastern Romania. The city is located in the mountain area of the Bukovinian Subcarpathians known as Obcinele Bucovinei, on the banks of the Moldova River.

The city is accessible by both car and train. The European route E58, that links the region of Moldavia with Transylvania, crosses the city. There are two railway stations located in the city: Câmpulung Moldovenesc in the city center and Câmpulung Est in Capu Satului neighborhood.

There are many places of interest located in and around Câmpulung Moldovenesc, such as the Rarău peak in the Rarău Massif and the Giumalău peak in the , which at and are the highest peaks in the region. One can also enjoy the forests which surround Câmpulung Moldovenesc or visit a monastery in one of the nearby villages.

== History ==
The first written mention of the village of Câmpulung Moldovenesc dates back to April 14, 1411. At that time, the ruling prince of Moldavia was Alexandru cel Bun. Dimitrie Cantemir, in his well-known work &quot;Descriptio Moldaviae&quot;, mentions &quot;Ocolul Câmpulung&quot;, an autonomous region in northern Moldavia that has its own rules and leaders. This region consisted of 15 villages. During the late Middle Ages, as the medieval town of Suceava and other neighbouring towns in the region of Moldavia, Câmpulung Moldovenesc operated under the Magdeburg law ().

Together with the rest of Bukovina, Câmpulung Moldovenesc was under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy (later Austria-Hungary) from 1775 to 1918. Câmpulung was in the Austrian part of the empire after the compromise of 1867, head of the district with the same name, one of the 9 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bukovina province. Other main district cities were &quot;Dorna Watra&quot; (Vatra Dornei) and &quot;Wama&quot; (Vama) in 1900.

After the Union of Bukovina with Romania at the end of World War I, the town became part of the Kingdom of Romania. Later, between 1925 and 1950, Câmpulung Moldovenesc was the capital of the former Câmpulung County, the most extensive county in Bukovina. The spa and ski resort Vatra Dornei was the second most important town in Câmpulung County. Following the administrative reforms implemented by the communist regime in 1950, the city became part of Suceava Region, while in 1968 it became part of Suceava County.

== Administration and local politics ==

=== Town council ===
The town&#x27;s current local council has the following political composition, according to the results of the 2020 Romanian local elections:

== Culture ==
Câmpulung Moldovenesc has the Wooden Spoons Museum, a museum that displays the wooden spoons collection of the deceased history professor Ion Țugui.

== Demographics ==
Câmpulung Moldovenesc reached its peak population in 1992, when more than 22,000 people were living within the city limits. As of 2016, the town of Câmpulung Moldovenesc was the fourth largest urban settlement in Suceava County, after the county capital, Suceava, and the larger towns of Rădăuți and Fălticeni.

At the 2011 census, Câmpulung Moldovenesc had a population of 16,105 inhabitants, as follows: 99.08% of inhabitants were ethnic Romanians, 0.25% Germans (Bukovina Germans), 0.22% Roma, 0.17% Ukrainians, and 0.09% Hungarians. At the 2021 census, the city had a population of 15,642.

== Economy ==
The main industries in Câmpulung Moldovenesc are dairy products, lumber, and ecotourism. Part of the city inhabitants works in agriculture and bovine growth.

<doc id="1275987" wikidata="Q741976" url="?curid=1275987" title="Moon illusion">
<text>The Moon illusion is the optical illusion of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does higher up in the sky. It has been known since ancient times and recorded by various cultures. The explanation of this illusion is still debated.

==Proof of illusion==
The angle that the diameter of the full Moon subtends at an observer&#x27;s eye can be measured directly with a theodolite to show that it remains constant as the Moon rises or sinks in the sky. Photographs of the Moon at different elevations also show that its size remains the same. 
A simple way of demonstrating that the effect is an illusion is to hold a small pebble (say, wide) at arm&#x27;s length () with one eye closed, positioning the pebble so that it covers (eclipses) the full Moon when high in the night sky. Then, when the seemingly very large Moon is on the horizon, the same pebble will also cover it, revealing that there has been no change in the size of the Moon.

Across different full moons, the Moon&#x27;s angular diameter can vary from 29.43 arcminutes at apogee to 33.5 arcminutes at perigee—a variation of around 14% in apparent diameter or 30% in apparent area. This is because of the eccentricity of the Moon&#x27;s orbit.

==Possible explanations==
The size of a viewed object can be measured objectively either as an &quot;angular size&quot; (the visual angle that it subtends at the eye, corresponding to the proportion of the visual field that it occupies), or as &quot;physical size&quot; (its real size measured in, say, meters). Perceived size is only loosely related to these concepts, however. For example, if two identical, familiar objects are placed at distances of five and ten meters, respectively, then the more distant object subtends approximately half the visual angle of the nearer object, but it is normally perceived to be the same size (a phenomenon referred to as &quot;size constancy&quot;), not as half the size. Conversely, if the more distant object did subtend the same angle as the nearer object then it is normally perceived to be twice as big.

One question concerning the Moon illusion, therefore, is whether the horizon Moon appears larger because its perceived angular size seems greater, or because its perceived physical size seems greater, or some combination of both. There is currently no consensus on this point. Most recent research on the Moon illusion has been conducted by psychologists specializing in human perception. The 2013 book &quot;The Moon Illusion&quot;, edited by Hershenson, offers 19 chapters written by various illusion researchers reaching different conclusions. After reviewing the many different explanations in their 2002 book &quot;The Mystery of the Moon Illusion&quot;, Ross and Plug conclude &quot;No single theory has emerged victorious.&quot; They argue that the size of the illusion is variable, but is usually an apparent increase in diameter of about 50 percent. The most important factor is the sight of the terrain, but there is a small contribution from other factors such as the angle of regard, posture, and eye movements.

===Refraction and distance===
Ptolemy attempted to explain the Moon illusion through atmospheric refraction in the &quot;Almagest&quot;, and later (in the &quot;Optics&quot;) as an optical illusion due to apparent distance, or the difficulty of looking upwards, although interpretations of the account in the &quot;Optics&quot; are disputed. Similarly Cleomedes (about 200 A.D.), in his book on astronomy, ascribed the illusion both to refraction and to changes in apparent distance. In the &quot;Book of Optics&quot; (1011–1022 A.D.), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) repeated refraction as an explanation, but also proposed a more detailed explanation based on intervening objects and apparent distance.

Through additional works (by Roger Bacon, John Pecham, Witelo, and others) based on Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s explanation, the Moon illusion came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon in the 17th century.

===Apparent distance hypothesis===
An apparent distance theory evidently was first clearly described by Cleomedes around 200 A.D. The theory proposes that the horizon Moon looks larger than the zenith Moon because it looks further away. Ibn al-Haytham was more specific: his argument was that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer; however, since there are no intervening objects between the Earth and the Moon, the perceived distance is too short and the Moon appears smaller than on the horizon. Researchers have argued that the apparent distance hypothesis is problematic scientifically because it explains perceptions as consequences of perceptions: the Moon looks further away because it looks larger. However, there are probably complex internal processes behind this relationship.

In 1813, Schopenhauer wrote about this, that the Moon illusion is &quot;purely intellectual or cerebral and not optical or sensuous&quot;. The brain takes the sense data that is given to it from the eye and it apprehends a large Moon because &quot;our intuitively perceiving understanding regards everything that is seen in a horizontal direction as being more distant and therefore as being larger than objects that are seen in a vertical direction.&quot; The brain is accustomed to seeing terrestrially-sized objects in a horizontal direction and also as they are affected by atmospheric perspective, according to Schopenhauer.

If the Moon is perceived to be in the general vicinity of the other things seen in the sky, it would be expected to also recede as it approaches the horizon, which should result in a smaller retinal image. But since its retinal image is approximately the same size whether it is near the horizon or not, the brain, attempting to compensate for perspective, assumes that a low Moon must be physically larger.

Extensive experiments in 1962 by Kaufman and Rock showed that a crucial causative factor in the illusion is a change in the pattern of cues to distance, comparable to the Ponzo illusion. The horizon Moon is perceived to be at the end of a stretch of terrain receding into the distance, accompanied by distant trees, buildings and so forth, all of which indicate that it must be a long way away, while these cues are absent from the zenith moon. Experiments by many other researchers have found the same result; namely, when pictorial cues to a great distance are subtracted from the vista of the large-looking horizon Moon it looks smaller. When pictorial cues to an increased distance are added into the vista of the zenith Moon, it appears larger.

A potential problem for the apparent distance theory has been that few people (perhaps about 5%) perceive the horizon Moon as being both larger and further away. Indeed, most people (perhaps 90%) say the horizon Moon looks both larger and &quot;closer&quot; than the zenith Moon (Boring, 1962; Hershenson, 1982; McCready, 1965, 1986; Restle, 1970). Most of the rest say it looks larger and about the same distance away as the zenith Moon, with a few people reporting no Moon illusion at all. However, the response that the horizon Moon appears larger, but not closer than the zenith Moon could be because the viewer&#x27;s logic confounds their perception; because the viewer knows that the Moon can&#x27;t possibly be &quot;physically&quot; further away, they are not consciously aware of the perception. This is reinforced by the idea that the brain does not consciously perceive distance and size, as spatial awareness is a subconscious, retino cortical cognition. In line with the possibility that the reported distance of the Moon is due to logic, rather than perception, is the finding that these varying reports—with some reporting closer distances and others not—are likely due to response biases. Nevertheless, the apparent distance explanation is the one most often found in textbooks.

===Relative size hypothesis===
Historically, the best-known alternative to the &quot;apparent distance&quot; theory has been a &quot;relative size&quot; theory. This states that the perceived size of an object depends not only on its retinal size, but also on the size of objects in its immediate visual environment. In the case of the Moon illusion, objects in the vicinity of the horizon Moon (that is, objects on or near the horizon) exhibit a fine detail that makes the Moon appear larger, while the zenith Moon is surrounded by large expanses of empty sky that make it appear smaller.

The effect is illustrated by the classic Ebbinghaus illusion, where a circle appears larger when surrounded by smaller circles, than it does when surrounded by larger circles.

===Angle of regard hypothesis===
According to the &quot;angle of regard&quot; hypothesis, the Moon illusion is produced by changes in the position of the eyes in the head accompanying changes in the angle of elevation of the Moon. Though once popular, this explanation no longer has much support. Looking through one&#x27;s legs at the horizon Moon does reduce the illusion noticeably, but this may be because the image on the retina is inverted. Raising the eyes or tilting the head when in an upright posture gives only a very small reduction in the illusion.

==Historical references==
Immanuel Kant refers to the Moon illusion in his 1781 text &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, when he writes that &quot;the astronomer cannot prevent himself from seeing the moon larger at its rising than some time afterwards, although he is not deceived by this illusion&quot;. Schopenhauer (1813) was cited above. Wade shortly summarizes historical references to the moon illusion starting with Aristotle; he lists quotes by Aristotle (~330 BC), Ptolemy (~142, 150), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (1083), John Pecham (~1280), Leonardo da Vinci (~1500), René Descartes (1637), Benedetto Castelli (1639), Pierre Gassendi (1642), Thomas Hobbes (1655), J. Rohault (1671), Nicolas Malebranche (1674), William Molyneux (1687), J. Wallis (1687), George Berkeley (1709), J.T. Desaguliers (1736), W. Porterfield (1737), R. Smith (1738), C.N. Le Cat (1744), D. Hartley (1749), Thomas Young (1807), and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1830).

<text>Yisrael Alter (, Hebrew: ; October 1895 – 20 February 1977), also known as the Beit Yisrael, after the works he authored, was the fifth Rebbe of the Hasidic dynasty of Ger, a position he held from 1948 until 1977.

== Biography ==

Yisrael Alter was born in Poland on the holiday of Isru Chag Sukkot (1894), the third son of Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter. Until the age of ten, he studied with his grandfather, Rabbi Yehuda Aryeh Leib Alter, and was already known as a prodigy. He was particularly known for his strict adherence to time. At thirteen, he became engaged to Chaya Sarah, the daughter of his cousin Rabbi Yaakov Meir Biderman, and married her in 1910. They had two children, a daughter named Rivka Yocheved, born in 1917, and a son, Yehuda Aryeh Leib (Leibele), born in 1921.

Following his father&#x27;s request for assistance, Yisrael began leading a group of young scholars within the Gerrer community, guiding them with spiritual teachings and personal instructions. This was confirmed by his brother, Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter, in a public address two weeks before his death.

In the month of Shevat 1932, Yisrael joined his father on his fourth journey to the Land of Israel and again in 1935 on the fifth trip. During the Holocaust, Yisrael fled with his father from Poland, eventually reaching Israel on the 8th of Nisan 1940. His immediate family—his wife and children—were murdered by the Nazis, as were most of the Gerrer Hasidim who lived in Poland. After his father&#x27;s death in 1948, Yisrael was appointed as his successor in the Gerrer Hasidic dynasty. In the same year, he remarried Perel (Charlotte), the daughter of David Weinfeld. They had no children.

== In Israel ==
As the new Gerrer Rebbe, Yisrael worked to rebuild the Hasidic movement, increasing its influence and shaping its future direction. He gathered the remaining Gerrer Hasidim who had settled in Israel before the war, along with Holocaust survivors, and sought to bring back those who, or whose families, had distanced themselves from the Hasidic movement.

He is considered one of the major figures in the rebuilding of the Haredi community after the Holocaust, particularly in establishing public norms regarding modesty, gender segregation, and separation from secular culture. His influence extended far beyond Gerrer Hasidim, attracting followers from other segments of society.

=== Public activity ===
Yisrael’s public activities were primarily within the framework of Agudat Yisrael. He placed great emphasis on education, working with other Haredi leaders to establish the Independent Education System, an autonomous religious education framework. Additionally, he was instrumental in founding the Haredi daily newspaper, Hamodia, and worked tirelessly to secure its financial stability.

The importance Yisrael placed on education and religious journalism can be seen in the fact that during his leadership, he avoided fundraising campaigns for any cause, except for a single fundraiser for the newspaper Hamodia and another for Independent Education.

In addition to his role as Rebbe and leader of Gerrer Hasidim, Yisrael also served as the chairman of the Council of Torah Sages. Through this position, he exerted significant influence over the policies and direction of Agudat Yisrael, a movement co-founded by his father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, known as the &quot;Imrei Emes&quot;. He also supported and encouraged the re-establishment of Hasidic courts from various communities destroyed during the war.

== Leadership ==
=== Reintroducing the pilgrimage to the Rebbe ===
As part of the effort to rebuild Gerrer Hasidism after the Holocaust, Yisrael revived the custom of traveling to the Rebbe for Shabbat and holidays, a central feature of pre-war Hasidism. This pilgrimage became a cornerstone of the Hasidic way of life and a key means of maintaining a close connection between the Rebbe and his followers.

=== Conducting the Tisch ===
Yisrael&#x27;s Tish (Hasidic feast) gatherings on Shabbat and holidays drew great attention. He placed significant importance on the Tish, and for nearly three decades of his leadership, only rarely did he miss conducting one, except when he was ill or resting in places like Haifa. He usually held two Tishes each Shabbat: one on Friday nights and another during the Seudah Shlishit (the third Shabbat meal), a time considered especially conducive to spiritual elevation in Hasidism (known as &quot;Re&#x27;uta de&#x27;Re&#x27;uta&quot;).

=== Emphasis on Jewish values (Yiddishkeit) ===
Yisrael placed a strong emphasis on Jewish values, particularly modesty, education on safeguarding the covenant, and separating from permissive, secular society. He viewed these values as foundational to the survival of the Jewish people and believed that strict observance could avert severe decrees upon Israel. His famous saying was, &quot;Yiddish doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters is Yiddishkeit.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
=== Holiness and spiritual ascension ===
In the biographical book &quot;Par Yisrael,&quot; Rabbi Baruch Vidislavsky, edited by Rabbi Aharon Sorsky, describes Yisrael’s leadership philosophy: &quot;He demanded of his followers spiritual ascension and sanctification. He believed that one could not escape sin without distancing oneself from physical pleasures, even those that were not prohibited by Torah.&quot;

=== Stringencies and asceticism ===
Yisrael instituted a stringent code of conduct for his followers, designed to distance them from sin and elevate them spiritually. Among other things, he imposed restrictions on physical contact between spouses, limiting marital relations to the bare minimum necessary. These regulations sparked opposition from some rabbis, including Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, who anonymously published a pamphlet criticizing Yisrael’s stringent approach. However, Kanievsky refrained from a public confrontation and expressed regret when his authorship was revealed.

== Death ==
Five years before his death, Yisrael underwent a successful surgery to remove a tumor from his intestines. He died in the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital on the 2nd of Adar 1977, of intestinal gangrene due to arterial blockage, after refusing to be taken to the hospital on the preceding day, Shabbat. He was buried in the &quot;Gerrer Cave&quot; on Mount of Olives.

<doc id="1275990" wikidata="Q208436" url="?curid=1275990" title="Martín Palermo">
<text>Martín Palermo (; born 7 November 1973) is an Argentine football manager and former player who played as a striker. He is currently the manager of Olimpia.

Palermo played mainly as a forward for Boca Juniors. A prolific goalscorer, he is Boca Juniors&#x27; all-time top scorer with 236 goals, and is placed 7th among all-time Primera División top scorers with 227 goals in 408 matches. He also played in Argentina for Estudiantes de La Plata and in Spain for Villarreal, Real Betis, and Alavés. During his playing career, he was nicknamed &quot;Loco&quot; (, ) and &quot;Titán&quot; (, ). In a 2008 poll, Boca Juniors fans chose him as the greatest idol in the club&#x27;s history.

With the Argentina national team, Palermo earned 15 caps and scored 9 goals. He played at the 1999 Copa América and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with a decade-long hiatus in between. Since 2012, he has worked as a manager in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Paraguay.

==Club career==

===Estudiantes===

Born in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Palermo began his career at Estudiantes de La Plata and played there for five years from 1992 to 1997 and later was transferred to Boca Juniors.

===Boca Juniors===
Palermo had a slow to start with Boca Juniors. In their seventh match of the 1997 Apertura on 30 September 1997, he scored his first goal in a 2–1 victory against Independiente.
In 1999, Palermo&#x27;s good goal average and performances with Boca and with the Argentina national team led European teams Lazio, Real Betis, and Milan to be interested in signing him up. But on 13 November 1999, in a game against Colón, he had a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament of his right knee; before leaving and without knowing the seriousness of the injury, he scored his 100th goal in the Argentine First Division.

He took six months to recover from the injury. On 24 May 2000, he returned, playing the last fifteen minutes of the quarterfinal match of the Copa Libertadores against River Plate and scoring a goal, leaving the score at 3–0 to Boca Juniors (the first match had ended 1–2).

He played in the Intercontinental Cup in 2000, scoring the two goals in Boca&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Real Madrid, winning the man of the match award and catching the attention of football clubs in Spain.

===Spell in Spain===
Palermo signed with Spanish La Liga newcomers Villarreal in January 2001, on a deal for the next four seasons. The transfer fee was 1.2 billion Spanish pesetas (€7.2 million). He made his debut on 5 February in a 2–0 home win over Alavés, in which he was substituted after 65 minutes for goalscorer Gheorghe Craioveanu. A week later, he scored his first goal to equalise in a 3–1 win at Real Oviedo. He scored six goals in 17 games in his first season for the team from the Province of Castellón, including one on 22 April as he was sent off in a 2–2 draw against Mallorca.

On 29 November 2001, Palermo scored an extra-time goal away to Levante in the last 32 of the Copa del Rey. He celebrated by standing on a small concrete wall, which collapsed under the weight of his team&#x27;s fans and broke both the tibia and fibula of his left leg. He did not recover until April 2002. On 5 May, his first start since the recovery, he took nine minutes to score in a 2–1 win over Real Zaragoza.

Villarreal reached the final of the 2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup, and Palermo was sent off for a foul on Josemi as they lost on aggregate to compatriots Málaga; the Spaniard also received a red card for retaliation. He did not score a league goal until the 11th game, when he netted in a 1–1 draw at a Mallorca side who were chasing first place. The 2002–03 season produced his best league figures of seven goals for Villarreal, but he left by mutual consent on 20 August 2003 after the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; added Sonny Anderson and José Mari to their front line.

The day after leaving Villarreal, Palermo signed for Real Betis of the same league on a one-year deal with the option of two more. He played only 12 total games for the team from Seville, scoring once on 3 September in a 2–2 home draw with Espanyol.

Palermo left Betis in March 2004 due to lack of playing time, and joined Alavés in the Segunda División. He scored three times in 14 games.

===Back to Boca Juniors===
On 13 July 2004, Palermo returned to Boca Juniors. On 17 December he scored his 100th goal with Boca on the final of the 2004 Copa Sudamericana a 2–0 victory over Bolívar.

On 26 May 2005, Palermo scored twice in a 4–0 Copa Libertadores victory over Atletico Junior, with Boca winning 7–3 on aggregate after a 3–3 draw in the first leg and qualifying to the Quarterfinals, which would be played against Chivas Guadalajara. In the first leg against Chivas at Estadio Jalisco, Boca suffered a heavy 4–0 defeat. In the second leg at home on 2 June, Palermo was involved in a brawl with Chivas player Adolfo Bautista and was sent off, and the match was eventually finished early due to a large brawl.

On 22 November 2005, in the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana SF against Chilean club Universidad Católica, Palermo scored Boca&#x27;s second goal to tie the score at 2–2; this goal proved to be very important as Boca won 1–0 away in the second leg and qualified to the finals. In the second leg of the Copa Sudamericana finals on 18 December 2005 against Pumas UNAM, Palermo scored a goal in the match which eventually finished 1–1 and went to penalties. In the penalty shootout, Palermo missed his penalty, but regardless Boca were champions after winning the shootout 4–3.

Palermo, once again back in top form, remained one of the best scorers in the Argentine league, scoring 11 goals in three consecutive matches (2006 Clausura, 2006 Apertura and top scorer of the 2007 Clausura). During the 2007 Clausura tournament he had several memorable moments, on 25 February he scored a half pitch goal in the last seconds of a 3–1 victory over Independiente and two weeks later, on 10 March, he scored three goals against his former team Estudiantes in a 3–1 Boca victory at La Plata. It was the fourth hat-trick of his career. A game later, on 18 March, he scored a career-high of four goals in the 5–1 victory against Gimnasia de la Plata, Estudiantes de La Plata&#x27;s arch-rivals.

The following season the 2007 Apertura, he continued to be among the Argentine league top scorers with 13 goals. His best game that season was on 16 September, in a game against Banfield, in which he scored four goals, in the 6–0 Boca victory.

In the second leg of the 2008 Copa Libertadores QF against Atlas, Palermo scored his fifth career hat-trick in a 3–0 victory in Jalisco, Mexico, on 21 May 2008, a hat-trick which sent Boca to the Copa Libertadores semi-finals. In the semifinals against Fluminense, Boca lost 5–3 on aggregate, with Palermo scoring Boca&#x27;s only goal in the 3–1 loss in Rio de Janeiro.

At the beginning of the 2008 Apertura, on 24 August he suffered yet another serious injury, this time he injured his anterior cruciate and tore his medial collateral ligament during the 2–1 victory against Lanús, with an expected recovery period of 5 to 8 months.
After this was known, Argentine coach Alfio Basile said that he had chosen him to play for the national team for the following match in the World Cup qualifiers.

Palermo&#x27;s first goal since his injury came on the fourth game he played, during a 3–1 victory over Huracán on 1 March in the 2009 Clausura; this was Martín Palermo&#x27;s 195 goal with Boca Juniors, breaking Francisco Varallo record of 194 goals in the professional era. Nearly two months later. on 30 April, Martín scored a bicycle kick goal, which gave him 200 goals with Boca Juniors, in a 3–0 victory against Deportivo Táchira.

During the 2009 Apertura, on 4 October in a game against Vélez Sársfield, Martín Palermo scored a very special goal (a header that traveled around 38.9 meters). This goal gave him 200 goals in the Argentine First Division and also gave Boca a 3–2 victory.

On 22 July 2010, at 36 years of age, Palermo announced that he had renewed his contract with Boca Juniors for one year and that he would retire at the end of the contract. Palermo scored his sixth career hat-trick on 19 September 2010 in a 3–1 Boca victory over Colón.

On 13 December 2010, Palermo scored his 300th career goal in the final match of the 2010 Apertura in a 1–1 draw against Gimnasia de La Plata.

On 24 April 2011, Palermo scored the third goal of Boca Juniors against Huracán in a 3–0 away win, ending a streak of 10 matches without scoring. Then he scored in the next consecutive matches against Independiente, Argentinos Juniors and in the 2–0 victory over River Plate in the Superclasico.

Palermo achieved legendary status in Boca in the last few years, thanks to his many memorable goals for both the club and the Argentina national team. On 12 June 2011, Palermo played his last home match at La Bombonera, after the match Martín was honored by the club and was given several gifts, among them being one of the goal frames in the stadium.

Palermo officially retired from football on 18 June 2011, in a 2–2 draw against his classic rival Gimnasia de La Plata. He provided a headed assist for Boca&#x27;s second goal in the last minute of the match, marking the end of a 19-year playing career at senior level.

==International career==
With the Argentina national football team, Palermo played fifteen matches and scored nine goals. He is in the Guinness Book of World Records for missing three penalties for Argentina in a single international match against Colombia in the 1999 Copa América; the first penalty rebounded off the crossbar; the second penalty went over; the third was saved by the Colombian goalkeeper, Miguel Calero. Though his international career seemed to be over at the end of 1999, the 2008 Argentine national coach Alfio Basile stated that he had been considering offering Palermo a return to international football and was disappointed that Palermo was injured at the time.

In September 2009, Diego Maradona recalled Palermo to the national team and introduced him as a substitute in a 2010 World Cup qualifying match against Paraguay after a 10-year exile from the international scene.
A couple of weeks later he was once again called up to play a friendly against Ghana. In this game, Palermo was part of the starting eleven and made the most of it by scoring both of Argentina&#x27;s goals, resulting in a 2–0 win. Palermo&#x27;s next match was on 10 October, a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Peru. Palermo sealed a 2–1 victory for Argentina with a 93rd-minute strike, causing Maradona to describe the goal after the game as &quot;one more miracle of Saint Palermo.&quot;

On 19 May 2010, Palermo was selected by Maradona as part of the Argentina national team&#x27;s 23-man final roster for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Palermo&#x27;s first World Cup. On 22 June 2010, Palermo played his first World Cup match, coming in as a substitute in the second half of Argentina&#x27;s final group match against Greece. In the 89th minute, he scored his first ever World Cup goal on a rebound from a shot by Lionel Messi. Argentina won the match 2–0 and finished at the top of their group. This goal also made Palermo the oldest Argentine national footballer to score a goal in World Cup play, an honor previously held by Maradona himself.

<doc id="1276001" wikidata="Q6723553" url="?curid=1276001" title="Machiavelli and the Four Seasons">
<text>Machiavelli and the Four Seasons is the third studio album by the Australian rock group TISM (This Is Serious Mum). It was released on 4 May 1995.

== Background and release ==
TISM worked on what would become their next album at Metropolis Audio between December 1992 and September 1993 with various producers, including Tony Cohen, Laurence Maddy and Paul McKercher. Tracks known from these sessions include &quot;Jung Talent Time&quot;, &quot;Aussiemandias&quot;, &quot;Abscess Makes the Heart Grow Fonder&quot; and &quot;State Schools are Great Schools&quot;. The group became dissatisfied with the hard rock sound they had cultivated with Cohen and realised after playing alongside Soundgarden on the Big Day Out in January 1994 that they did not want to be associated with grunge, which was at the height of its popularity at the time. The group abandoned work on the album and started recording new demos in a techno-influenced alternative dance style after returning from the Big Day Out. Three months later, their demos were wiped by a computer virus.

In September 1994, the group recorded &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot; at Platinum Studios. The final track list included &quot;Jung Talent Time&quot; and &quot;Aussiemandias&quot; from the September 1993 sessions. The chorus to &quot;How Do I Love Thee&quot; is taken from the end of the second movement of &quot;Opium is the Religion of the Masses&quot;, a song written by TISM in 1983 and played during the &quot;Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance&quot; tour in 1988.

A song entitled &quot;Russia&quot; was intended to be the last song on the album, but was removed for legal reasons due to the song&#x27;s chorus, which was seen to be similar to &quot;Back in the USSR&quot; by The Beatles. It remained unreleased until 2009, when an edited version, retitled &quot;The Last Soviet Star&quot;, was released as an iTunes bonus. The original version, however, was uploaded to an old version of the TISM website, appeared on promotional pressings released in late 1994, and is known to have been played during TISM&#x27;s set at the 1993 Big Day Out, at Melbourne Showgrounds (a diatribe recited at this concert appeared on &quot;Australia the Lucky Cunt&quot;). It would later see wide release for the first time as a hidden track on the 2023 CD reissue.

The title is a composite phrase of doo wop group Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and thinker Niccolò Machiavelli. The cover of the album is a picture of The Hollywood Argyles.

On 26 August 2024, music journalist and known TISM fan Tyler Jenke announced a book in the &quot;33 1/3&quot; series about the album, to be released on 1 May 2025.

== Singles ==
* &quot;Jung Talent Time&quot; was released in February 1995 as the album&#x27;s lead single.
* &quot;(He&#x27;ll Never Be An) Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; was released in June 1995. The album peaked at number 23 on the ARIA Charts.)
* &quot;Greg! The Stop Sign!!&quot; was released in August 1995. The song peaked at number 59 on the ARIA Charts and was nominated for an ARIA Award at the ARIA Music Awards of 1996.
* &quot;Garbage&quot; was released in January 1996
* &quot;All Homeboys Are Dickheads&quot; was pressed up and prepared for sale, but for reasons unknown, prior to shipping, TISM ordered that the single be deleted. Copies of the single did make their way into the hands of TISM fans. It was also released as a promo with &quot;Machines Against the Rage&quot;.

==Reception==
The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 8 on the ARIA Charts and was certified Gold in 1996. To celebrate &quot;Machiavelli&quot; going &quot;gold&quot;, it was re-released with a bonus disc in January 1996. The album was re-released again in December 1996 with a live album.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, the album won the ARIA Award for Best Independent Release. Three of its songs reached Triple J Hottest 100, 1995, two of them in the top 10.

Jonathan Lewis from AllMusic said TISM &quot;had generated a strong cult following during the 14 years of their existence prior to the release of this album, but commercial success had proved elusive.. but for &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot;, the band chose to embrace dance music and the resulting commercial success this album enjoyed came as a shock, at least to the band, if to no one else.&quot; Lewis opined the album &quot;sees TISM at their wittiest since &quot;Great Truckin&#x27; Songs of the Renaissance&quot;&quot; adding &quot;Their lyrics are smart and their use of musical trends extremely clever... Funny, clever, and just tasteless enough to make it interesting, &quot;Machiavelli and the Four Seasons&quot; was easily the best TISM album of the &#x27;90s.&quot;

In 2021, the album was ranked #74 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 200 Greatest Australian Albums of All Time, with Tyler Jenke stating the album was &quot;another musical evolution for the group, combining the whip-smart social satire they employed within their lyrics and pairing it with compositions that coupled commercial appeal with stellar musicianship and artistry&quot; and concluding his writing saying the band &quot;had crafted one of the decade’s best and most memorable albums, and their success and recognition was truly deserved.

On January 10, 2023, Paul Simpson highlighted the album as one of AllMusic&#x27;s Staff Picks of that week, comparing the band to the likes of the &quot;Justified Ancients of Mu Mu&quot; and &quot;Chumbawamba&quot;, &quot;but more absurd and tasteless&quot; and that the band &quot;embraced rave culture in the mid-‘90s and unexpectedly hit the top ten with their gold-selling third album.&quot; He highlights “(He’ll Never Be An) Ol’ Man River” as the breakthrough hit, but said &quot;the best song is “Garbage”, a thrashing breakbeat techno track with lyrics condemning classic rock and the endless recycling of nostalgia.&quot;

<text>The Niranam poets, also known as the Kannassan poets, were three poets from the same family by the names of Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar, and Rama Panikkar. They hailed from Niranam, a small village in southern Kerala, India, near the town of Thiruvalla. Their works mainly comprised translation and adaptation of Sanskrit epics and Puranic works and were for devotional purposes. They lived between 1350 and 1450 C.E.

It is believed that they all belonged to the same Kannassa family and that Madhava Panikkar and Sankara Panikkar were the uncles of Rama Panikkar, the youngest of the three.

As Kannassa, they were probably Nair Panikkers or members of the Kaniyar caste, which makes their claim to mastery of Sanskrit a significant feature as Kaniyar, being adept in Astrology and Ayurveda, they were accepted by then the Kings 

Their works have been mostly assigned to the &quot;Pattu&quot; &quot;taxon&quot;. It revived the &quot;Bhakti&quot; school of literature and reasserted the seriousness of the poetic vocation in the place of the excessive sensuality and eroticism of the &quot;Manipravalam&quot; poets. Divergence from the &quot;Manipravalam&quot; school, through non-usage of Dravidian metre and Sanskrit grammatical forms, are noted.

Madhava Panikkar&#x27;s &quot;Bhasha Bhagavadgita&quot;, a condensed Malayalam translation of &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; was its first translation into any modern Indian language. Sankara Panikkar&#x27;s main work is &quot;Bharatamala&quot;, a masterly condensation of &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Perhaps the most important was Rama Panikkar, who is the author of &quot;Ramayanam&quot;, &quot;Bharatam&quot;, &quot;Bhagavatam&quot;, and &quot;Sivarathri Mahatmyam&quot;. &quot;Kannassa Ramayanam&quot; and &quot;Kannassa Bharatam&quot; are the most important of these Niranam works. The former is an important link between Cheeraman&#x27;s &quot;Ramacharitam&quot;, Ayyappilli Asan&#x27;s &quot;Ramakathapattu&quot; and Ezhuthachan&#x27;s &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam&quot;. Ulloor has said that Rama Panikkar holds the same position in Malayalam literature that Edmund Spenser has in English literature.

<text>The Eumuroida are a clade defined in 2004 by Steppan et al. to describe a group of muroid rodents (mice, rats and relatives). The clade is not defined in the standard taxonomic hierarchy, but it is between superfamily and family.

The Eumuroida are technically defined as the clade including all organisms descended from the most recent common ancestor of the Calomyscidae, Nesomyidae, Cricetidae, and Muridae. It specifically excludes the fossorial forms of mouse-like rodents in the family Spalacidae. It has yet to be determined if the Platacanthomyidae belong to the Eumuroida, but Norris et al. (2004) suggested they do not because of subtle features in the skull.

Norris et al. (2004) noted that two characters can be used to define the Eumuroida: the infraorbital foramen is V-shaped and extends to the roof of the palate, and the incisive foramina are medium to large in size. The zygomatic plate is at least moderately developed in this group, producing the V shape. The common ancestors of the Eumuroida were probably not specialized as burrowing animals, whereas the spalacid ancestor may have been.

Jansa and Weksler (2004) noted that the Eumuroid ancestors likely had hamster-like (cricetid) molars as opposed to mouse-like molars (murid). Essentially, the occlusal surface of the molars probably had two rows of cusps (cricetid) instead of three (murid).

Early fossil muroids, such as cricetodontines, represent a possible ancestor to the Eumuroida. These rodents have cricetid teeth, hence the name: Neo-Latin &quot;cricetus&quot; &#x27;hamster&#x27;, Ancient Greek &quot;odóntes&quot; &#x27;teeth&#x27;. The presence of these fossils in Eurasia is parsimonious, because most families of eumuroids (except the Nesomyidae) have representatives in Asia. Steppan et al. (2004) suggested the most recent common ancestor of the Eumuroida lived around the transition between the Oligocene and Miocene. This date only slightly precedes the first appearance of cricetodontines.

<text>Xinzheng () is a county-level city of Henan Province, China. It is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Zhengzhou, the provincial capital. The city has a population of 600,000 people and covers an area of , of which is urban.

==History==
Xinzheng is considered one of the birthplaces of the Chinese nation. More than 8000 years ago, Neolithic people of Peiligang culture lived in the vicinity. The legendary Yellow Emperor was said to have been born in Xinzheng 5000 years ago. During the Zhou dynasty it was the capital of the state of Zheng and later, the state of Han, after the conquest of the former by the latter. It was the seat of government for the Qin dynasty, from about 221 BCE, which is considered the beginning of a unified China. The word &quot;qin&quot; (), which is pronounced similar to &quot;chin&quot;, is thought to be the basis for the word &quot;China.&quot;

Historically, this prefecture was an integrated part of Zhengzhou. However, in 1994, the Henan Provincial Council authorized the incorporation of Xinzheng into a separate municipality.

==Administrative divisions==
As 2012, this city is divided to three subdistricts, nine towns and three townships.

==Climate==

==Education==
Xinzheng has one of the largest concentrations of foreign teachers in central China due to the presence of Sias International University. The school has over 27,000 students and over 120 foreign teachers and their 40 dependent family members. Along with Sias University, the city is also home to another university: ShengDa.

==Economy==
Xinzheng has a diversified economy, though agriculture and heavy industry dominate the economic landscape.

===Agriculture===
Xinzheng&#x27;s agriculture involves the cultivation of maize, cotton, tobacco and other industrial crops. The city is well known for its jujube or Chinese Date. At harvest time, large quantities of these fruits are sold in markets, as well as on the side of the roads into the town.

===Industry===
Xinzheng is home to several industrial factories, namely cigarette factories, which are located near the center of town. In 2006, more than US$2 billion was invested in a nearby industrial project, although the status of this investment is currently unknown. Mining coal locally has also been an important source of income.

===Impact of educational institutions===
Two large private universities, ShengDa University and Sias International University play a major role in the local economy as well. ShengDa has 14,000 students, and Sias University has over 27,000 students. Service industries (restaurants, hotels, banks, retail shops, etc.) to accommodate the students have sprung out around the universities in abundance. At Sias, the administration tacitly allows students to live off campus, creating a large community of landlords around the university. The presence of 40,000 students has had an undeniable and long lasting impact on the community.

===Tourism===

Due to limited accommodation, lack of infrastructure, pollution and other factors, tourism has been slow to take off in Xinzheng. Every Spring, the city hosts a ceremony honoring the Yellow Emperor, the legendary ancestor of the Chinese nation. In 2009, this celebration attracted over 10,000 Chinese people from within the People&#x27;s Republic of China, as well as many Overseas Chinese.

However, many of these guests find accommodations in nearby Zhengzhou, and the economic impact to the city is minimal. Xinzheng is said to be an &#x27;open-air&#x27; museum, and the nearby Shizu mountain is said to be the exact birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. The Zhengzhou Dragon realization company began construction at the turn of the 21st century of a large concrete dragon that would straddle the mountain.

A giant dragon was being constructed by private investors near the city out of concrete and marble with a 29.9m tall head and a body that would have stretched along the ridge line of Shizu Mountain. The hollow body of the dragon was slated to be 9m high and 6m wide and would have contained a light rail system along with facilities for sight seeing and leisure, such as shops, restaurants and luxury clubs. The project was expected to be completed before October 1, 2009, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. However, lack of funding, and a general lack of interest, left the project unfinished.

==Transportation==

===Air===
The airport that serves the provincial capital, Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport , is located in Xinzheng. This is of particular importance not only because it is an airport for a large urban center, but because it is the only international airport for the province of 100 million. On February 8, 2009, a nonstop air route between Zhengzhou and Taipei–Taoyuan was launched; this route was initially operated by Shenzhen Airlines.

===Rail===
As in the rest of China, rail transport in Xinzheng is handled by the China Railway Corporation. Xinzheng itself had a small railroad station, , at the edge of town that used to accommodate trains on the Beijing–Guangzhou railway, as well as to and from Zhengzhou. It is no longer open.

However, nearby Zhengzhou is a major railway hub, with services radiating in all directions nationally. As of 2007, high-speed rail service began between Zhengzhou and Beijing. To do any travel beyond the Zhengzhou immediate area, most residents travel to Zhengzhou, then onward.

===Mass transit===
The regional bus station to the north of the town&#x27;s city center () serves buses destined for Zhengzhou, Xinmi, Kaifeng, and Luoyang.

===Taxi===
All Xinzheng taxis belong to the same local company, with a starting fare of 6 renminbi.

===Roads===
Xinzheng is well connected to Zhengzhou and points south by China National Highway 107. All inter-city roads are well maintained. Within the city limits, as in the rest of many small Chinese cities, many residential roads remain in a serious state of disrepair.

<doc id="1276014" wikidata="Q1814517" url="?curid=1276014" title="Nissan Vanette">
<text>The is a cabover van and pickup truck produced by the Japanese automaker Nissan from 1978 until 2011. The first two generations were engineered by Nissan&#x27;s Aichi Manufacturing Division for private, personal ownership, with the last two generations built by Mazda, rebadged as Nissans and refocused as commercial vehicles, based on the Mazda Bongo. The van has also been sold as the Nissan Sunny-Vanette or Nissan Van. The private purchase passenger platform was replaced by the Nissan Serena in 1991, renamed Vanette in various international markets, and came equipped with multiple engine and drivetrain configurations.

2WD and 4WD versions were produced, with manual, automatic, floor and column shift options available. While no longer produced for the Japanese market, it was still available in other markets around the world such as Malaysia. Production ended around 2010, eventually being replaced by the Nissan NV200.

==History==
The first appearance of a cabover truck/delivery van appeared in 1962 with the Datsun Cablight, a rebadged version of the earlier Kurogane Mighty Nissan acquired when they assumed the operations of Tokyu Kogyo Kurogane. As the Cablight was reengineered, it was offered as a cab-over truck and van called the Datsun Sunny Cab/Nissan Cherry Cab (C20) introduced in 1969, and was one size smaller from the Prince Homer truck and the Prince Homy van. The cabover approach allowed the exterior dimensions to remain unchanged while increasing the length of the cargo area of the Nissan Sunny truck. The Sunny Cab Van/Cherry Cab Van passenger van could accommodate five passengers and an extended length coach that could carry eight people. Both Cab Vans didn&#x27;t have sliding passenger doors, instead they had conventional front-hinged doors with extended lengths on the passenger side. The rear tailgate was a clamshell design where the door separated into two pieces that would extend up, with a tailgate on the lower half of the door.


The commercial model was basic, that kept the price low. The Sunny Truck continued to be built after the introduction of the second generation passenger version, and was only replaced in early 1971 by the new B120-series truck. The Cabover trucks were renamed the Nissan Vanette and the Nissan Cherry Cab/Vanette or Vonnate.
== First generation (C120; 1978–1988)==
Introduced in October 1978 as a replacement for the 1969 Nissan Cherry Cab/Sunny Cab C20 and Nissan Sunny Cab Van/Nissan Cherry Cab Van, the first Vanette was exported as the Datsun C20 (later the Nissan C20) or as the Nissan Datsun Vanette (later the Nissan Vanette). In the home market it was initially marketed as either the &#x27;Nissan Sunny Vanette&#x27; or the &#x27;Nissan Cherry Vanette&#x27;, depending on the distribution network, although in engineering terms it borrowed heavily from the rear-wheel drive generations of the Sunny line—in particular the B210 and B310 series models, with which it shared engines and transmissions. The Sunny Vanette was sold through &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot; and the Cherry Vanette was sold through &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; locations. These two models had somewhat differing front-end treatment. In March 1980, a Datsun Vanette version was also added, sold through the &quot;Nissan Bluebird Store&quot; dealer network. The Datsun Vanette received twin headlights, while its related models had single headlights. It was a junior model to the larger Nissan Caravan.

Initially it was available in three lines: a truck version, vans (usually with passenger accommodation), and as a 9-seat minibus (Vanette Coach). The Coach received a A14 four cylinder, producing at 5,400 rpm. The van and truck versions originally had to make do with the lesser A12 of and at the same engine speed. Later, the 1400 engine became available in Van and Truck versions as well. In July 1979, a high-roof version was added, as well as a long wheelbase van and ten-seater Coach version. This was stretched by 33 cm between the front and side doors, LWB versions were never available with the A12 engine. Some versions received separate air conditioning outlets for the rear.
In June 1980, the Coach version changed from the A14 to the larger (1,487 cc) A15 engine, offering . There was also a luxurious SGL version of the Vanette Coach added, with an available sunroof and swivelling captain&#x27;s chairs in the rear – both firsts for the segment in Japan. To indicate its luxurious nature, the SGL received double square headlights for a more modern appearance. In June 1981 the LD20 diesel engine was added, as was a 2-litre gasoline version (Z20) for the top-of-the-line SGX version.

In 1981, Nissan introduced a smaller passenger vehicle which had sliding passenger doors on both sides of the vehicle, with conventional front doors, called the Nissan Prairie, making the Vanette/Largo no longer the smallest cargo van offered.

In October 1982, minor changes occurred (along with the introduction of the bigger &quot;Largo&quot;). The dashboard was redesigned, while the base &#x27;CT&#x27; model received front disc brakes, the optional air conditioning system was modernized, and an inexpensive &#x27;FL&#x27; Coach version was added. In October 1983 a DX-A version was added, followed by modifications to the transmission carried out in August 1985. The next month, production of Van and Coach models ended as they were replaced by the C22 Vanette. The truck versions of the C120 Vanette remained in production (with light modifications carried out in August 1986) until September 1988.

On February 3, 1986, Nissan and Daewoo signed an agreement where the latter would build the Vanette under a technical collaboration agreement, partially agreed on in response to Seoul&#x27;s announcement that they would abolish restrictions on manufacturing certain vehicle types. On May 3, 1987, the first Daewoo Vanette would be sold in South Korea.

=== Vanette Largo ===
The Vanette Largo (GC120) was introduced in October 1982 and was a wider (by 90 mm, to stay just beneath the important Japanese 1,700 mm tax threshold) and somewhat longer version. This was then developed into a cargo version built in Spain (by Nissan Ibérica), called the Nissan/Datsun Vanette Cargo. This largely supplanted the smaller Vanette versions in European markets. Engines were the A15 and Z20 gasoline versions, accompanied by the diesel LD20 (also available turbocharged). The Spanish-built versions were originally intended to be built with a Spanish-made Perkins diesel motor but this did not materialize. There was a minibus &#x27;Coach&#x27; version of the Largo as well, with a luxurious &quot;Grand Saloon&quot; version topping the range.

The Vanette Largo continued in production until a GC22 successor arrived, in May 1986. From this point the Vanette name was dropped and the Largo became a separate, more luxurious model in its own right. In the Japanese market, the C120 vehicle was either marketed as the Datsun Vanette Largo or as a Nissan with the Cherry and Sunny prefixes. The Spanish C220 received a facelift and continued to be built into the 1990s, and was mostly sold in markets which hindered the import of Japanese-built vehicles.

== Second generation (C22; 1985–1994)==
=== Japan ===
5 trim levels, 4 engine options and 2 transmission options were available for the C22 Vanette COACH series launched in Japan.
SC - 5/6 seater, available in 1.5L A15 (67ps) petrol engine and 2L LD20.II (67ps) diesel engine. Manual only transmission. Distinguished by round headlamps and no rear screen wiper.

GL - 8/9 seater, available in 1.5L engine and 2L diesel. Manual only transmission. Square headlamps.

SGL- 8/9 seater, available in 1.5L and 2L diesel engine. Automatic transmission optional. Rectangle headlamps with high roof. All SGL variants has collapsible seats, rotatable middle row seat and rear air conditioning. Longer body length of 4050mm vs the SC and GL at 3980mm 

SGL Panorama Roof - Similar to SGL except with the optional glass sunroof that stretches from driver seat row to 2nd row seats. 

SGL EXCEL - 8 seater, available in 2L petrol Z20S or 2L diesel LD20.II engine. Later models came with CA20 petrol engine. Automatic transmission optional. Top of the range model which comes with color coded bumpers, chrome trimming, central locking, panorama glass roof, factory fitted audio and cooler box mounted in the center console.
A late model update with enlarged version similar to the US market Nissan Van was again sold in Japan as the Largo, until 1992 when the Serena-based Nissan Largo was launched.

===South Korea===
The Vanette would continue to be produced in South Korea under Daewoo up to 1992. It suffered from a poorly performing Isuzu 2.2-liter diesel engine which was used instead of the original Nissan engine.

=== United States ===
The Nissan C22 was modified for the United States market to compete with the similar sized Toyota Van and Mitsubishi Van, and to join the growing minivan market in the US. This van was sold as the &quot;Nissan Van&quot; in the US from 1986–1989, where it was billed as a cheaper alternative to Chrysler&#x27;s minivans. Most of the vans were sold in the Sun Belt states, particularly California, Texas, and Florida, and sales were strongest for the first two years. Nissan had to engineer its larger 2.4-liter Z24i engine into the C22 to handle American market requirements which included air conditioning and highway driving. The C22 was not originally designed for such a large engine, and the resulting tight quarters would later contribute to overheating and engine fire issues.

In 1994, after four safety recalls did not end the engine fire problems, and with a class action lawsuit pending, Nissan took the unprecedented step of recalling every Nissan Van sold in the US. Van owners were offered Kelly Blue Book value or more for their van, and most accepted, but a few opted to keep their vans. Critics argued that Nissan had been long aware of the problems with the vans (the first reports of fires appeared in 1987, shortly after they went on sale in the US), but did not take action for years, after which they had been replaced by the Nissan Quest. By the time of the recall in 1994, at least 135 fires had been reported, although none of them had resulted in deaths or injuries. The class-action settlement offered discounts on the purchase of a new Nissan vehicle. The vehicles which were recalled were crushed &quot;en masse&quot;.

The Nissan Van was intended mainly as a stopgap for the North American market until a proper minivan could be introduced, and it was replaced by the Nissan Quest in 1993, a vehicle designed in a joint venture with Ford.

===Malaysia===

The C22 Nissan Vanette was built in Malaysia at the Tan Chong assembly plant in Segambut (Kuala Lumpur) until 2010. After 13 years in production, it was the longest running model built in Malaysia. There was a chassis cab, a truck, a panel van, and a window van version. Malaysian Vanettes have the venerable 1.5-liter pushrod A15 engine, with . While it has had a few facelifts over the years, the basic body was still the same. The 1980s interior is still intact. Malaysia was the only place where the Vanette was built for many years, being exported from there to many other markets. After a brief hiatus, it was replaced by the Nissan NV200, which retains the &quot;Vanette&quot; name in the Malaysian market.

=== Philippines ===
The Nissan Vanette was available in the Philippines until the end of 1999 as the Nissan Vanette Grand coach. In its final version it remains essentially the same Vanette as in previous years except for a different wheel design, upgraded seat materials and a faux wood trim dashboard. The sole engine available is the Z20 2.0-liter gasoline engine. Unlike in other Asian countries, no diesel variant was offered or available, which was an oversight on Nissan&#x27;s part that could have made the difference in the van&#x27;s popularity.

=== India ===
The C22 Vanette also provides the basis for Ashok Leyland&#x27;s &quot;Dost&quot;, the Indian truck manufacturer&#x27;s first entry into this market segment.

<text>Andy Walker is a Canadian television personality and journalist.

He is best known as having been a co-host alongside Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur of &quot;Call for Help&quot;, a technology help television program on G4techTV Canada in Canada and the HOW TO Channel in Australia. His most popular segments on the show were what he called &quot;food demos&quot; which use household groceries like cheese and whip cream to show how complex technology mechanisms work. In one show he built a transistor out of cheddar cheese and tomato juice.

Walker is also the owner of Cyberwalker.com , a technology advice website, and the author of &quot;The Absolute Beginner&#x27;s Guide to Security, Spam, Spyware and Viruses&quot; and &quot;Windows Vista Help Desk&quot; both from Que Books. He also co-authored the book &quot;You Call This the Future?&quot; (Chicago Review Press) with Nick Sagan and Mark Frary.

In December 2013, Walker announced he had signed deal with Pearson Education to write his 5th book called Super You: How Technology is Revolutionizing What it Means to Be Human. It was co-authored with blogger/entrepreneur Kay Svela (AwesomeLifeClub.com; DeathisObsolete.comDepression Zone) and Walker&#x27;s longtime collaborator Sean Carruthers. Super You was published in June 2016.
Walker was married to Svela in July 2014. They have a boy Carter Devon Walker, born in February 2014.

Besides channelling his two most recent books toward transhumanism and hyper longevity, Walker is also working as a futurist keynote speaker.

==Background==
On August 31, 2005, after hosting &quot;Call for Help&quot; with Leo Laporte for over a year, Walker announced that he was leaving the show due to an unsatisfactory pay cut in his proposed contract renewal.

Walker hosted two spin-offs to Call For Help called Web Gems and My Media. 
Web Gems focused on tips and tricks on navigating the Internet. 
My Media was focused on TV and living room technology. Both shows aired on G4techTV Canada until late 2006. He appeared as one of the first guests on Leo Laporte&#x27;s old television show The Lab with Leo Laporte, which started production in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in April 2007 and aired in May 2007 on G4techTV Canada in Canada and the HOW TO Channel in Australia. Walker also co-hosted an internet technology podcast called Lab-Rats with Sean Carruthers until late 2011. But in 2012, Andy Walker and Sean Carruthers once again started the Lab Rats podcast which can be found at Lab Rats.

In January 2013, it was announced that Walker would be a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal. Walker&#x27;s community service includes founder of the Little Geeks Foundation, a national Canadian non-profit charity that provides computers to school children from families in need. Walker also serves as a technology advisor to His Honour David Onley on his aboriginal children literacy initiative. Walker was also a technology advisor to Kids Help Phone, a national 24-hour telephone and online counselling service for children.

She has moderated sessions with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, former FBI Director James Comey, business coach Tony Robbins, literary icon Margaret Atwood, and many other leading public figures. Keynote topics include digital approaches to successful business and, most recently, artificial intelligence.

===Technology===
MacArthur worked for Microsoft for two years as a web strategist, as a web designer at Razorfish in San Francisco, and as a judge at the Webby Awards 2000. She was also Director of Web Marketing at HigherMarkets, &quot;where she managed corporate branding initiatives, software usability and online course development.&quot; In 2007, she co-founded a media company MGImedia Communications Inc. with her brother Jeff.

===Television===
Upon graduation, MacArthur worked in her hometown of Charlottetown at CBC Television, as an associate reporter from April to July 1999, and the San Francisco radio station KQED. In July 2002, she co-hosted a Discovery Channel special &quot;Science on the Red Carpet&quot;, with Dave Foley at the Science &amp; Technical Academy Awards. She appeared weekly in the summer of 2006, as a tech columnist for CBC Newsworld.

In 2004, MacArthur became a host on &quot;Call for Help&quot;, a technology series produced for G4techTV Canada, which still airs daily on G4 Canada and HOW TO Channel in Australia. MacArthur is the subject of a song written in tribute to &quot;Call for Help&quot; 2.0. While working as a host on &quot;Call for Help&quot;, MacArthur joined the series &quot;Gadgets and Gizmos&quot; as a co-host, working with Marc Saltzman and Andy Walker until the show ended production in 2005.

From August 2004 to September 2006, MacArthur was host of the G4techTV Canada program &quot;Torrent&quot;, which is still in production. She also hosted &quot;Gadgets and Gizmos&quot; for the Canadian channel.

On 28 August 2006, MacArthur announced on her blog that she was leaving her position at G4techTV and would no longer appear on &quot;Call For Help&quot;, &quot;Torrent&quot;, or &quot;Gadgets and Gizmos&quot;.

In mid-September, she joined Citytv, CP24 in Toronto with the title &quot;New Media Specialist&quot;, to report on &quot;new media and interactive trends&quot; for City&quot;News&quot; International. She first appeared on the station&#x27;s nightly newscast, &quot;CityNews at Six&quot;, commenting in another reporter&#x27;s story on 9/11 conspiracy theories propagated through the Internet. Segments since have ranged from former sex trade workers blogging the Robert Pickton trial, to a Toronto Transit Commission/Google Maps mashup.

In January 2007, she launched a weekly program on CP24, which became quite popular as a vodcast. Originally titled &quot;Inside Popnology&quot;, the CHUM Television-produced program quickly became &quot;Webnation&quot;. She resigned in October to go for freelance projects, feeling she was being asked to target too old an audience, and wanted to pursue two projects in the United States. They convinced her to stick around for two more months, after Rogers Communications promised her show would be weekly on the Citytv network and on G4techTV Canada, reformatted, as of January 2008 as &quot;Webnation V2&quot;. (CTV&#x27;s parent company; CTVglobemedia bought out CHUM Limited in June 2007, with the exception of the Citytv network, which was sold to Rogers.)

She was informed on 4 January 2008 that the budget was not there for the program. Just before the announcement, the program was named the &quot;Top New Podcast Award for 2007&quot; by iTunes. Citytv began airing &quot;The Lab with Leo Laporte&quot; around this time. CP24 has since made some reorganization to the anchors/reporters as a result of the change in ownership of CP24&#x27;s former parent company; CHUM Limited. For a time, after David Onley was named Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, MacArthur hosted &quot;Home Page&quot;; Jee-Yun Lee replaced her when MacArthur resigned. MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;Webnation&quot; replaced &quot;HomePage&quot; on the CP24 schedule 14 October 2009.

Over the years, she has been a technology guest on CBC Newsworld, CBC Radio, Global TV, CTV Montreal, MTV Live, MuchMoreMusic, Life Network, and CFRB.

===Podcasting===
In June 2005, MacArthur started the weekly video podcast &quot;commandN&quot;, which covered technology trends both online and offline. The podcast has not released an episode since June 2013, however. A commercial study found that commandN was the fifth most-downloaded podcast among surveyed Canadians.

Through October 2006, she worked on a podcast with &quot;Call for Help&quot; co-host Leo Laporte called &quot;Inside the Net&quot;, which then morphed into &quot;net@night&quot;, and then &quot;The Social Hour&quot; with Sarah Lane, a Friday lunch time live broadcast. The show was available as part of the TWIT.tv network before it was retired from the Twit network in October 2014.

MacArthur describes how various types of technology work on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio show/podcast Spark.

===Journalism===
Since summer of 2006, she has written a monthly &quot;Web Trends&quot; column for &quot;The Calgary Sun Urbane Magazine&quot;. She has been quoted by major Canadian newspapers, when they need a tech expert. &quot;Now Magazine&quot; declared her the &quot;Best geek personality&quot;, 2006.

<doc id="1276019" wikidata="Q75938" url="?curid=1276019" title="Santa Cruz, Laguna">
<text>Santa Cruz, officially the Municipality of Santa Cruz (), is a municipality and capital of the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 123,574 people.

Santa Cruz is situated on the banks of the Santa Cruz River which flows into the eastern part of Laguna de Bay. The town is bounded by the Bay on the north, by Lumban and Pagsanjan towns in the east, Pagsanjan and Magdalena towns in the south, and Pila in the west. It is from Manila via Calamba and Los Baños. It is accessible by land from Metro Manila passing through Rizal Province via Manila East Road or via South Luzon Expressway

Santa Cruz is considered as the service and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. The town is composed of five barangays in the Poblacion area and 21 classified urban barangays. Although relatively far from the immediate urbanizing influence of Metropolitan Manila, Santa Cruz continues to progress. It is now classified as municipality. The present administration is headed by the Mayor Egay San Luis Sr.. Santa Cruz is also the seat of the provincial government since 1885, giving the municipality an additional administrative function over the entire province. It also functions as the service center for transportation, commerce, health, education, and other social services for the predominantly rural north-eastern municipalities of the province. Boosting the economy of the municipality are the incipient and fast-growing agribusiness industries such as livestock raising, horticulture and aquaculture. The town is composed of twenty-six (26) urban barangays. All barangays are being classified as urban.

The development of Santa Cruz as the administrative, commercial, and service center of Laguna makes it accessible for all private/public vehicles going to nearby places particularly Pagsanjan, Lake Caliraya, Liliw, Paete and Nagcarlan.

==History==

=== Spanish colonial period ===
During the last decade of the 16th century, Santa Cruz was once a well populated barrio of the present municipality of Lumban, as well as other contemporary towns like Pagsanjan, Cavinti, Paete and Pangil. On September 6, 1602, Santa Cruz separated from Lumban and became a pueblo with its church and local government. For being in an unhealthy state, the center of the town was moved in 1608 to where it is today.

Since its foundation in 1602, the town had been ravaged by calamitous forces such as fires, typhoons, floods and human vandalism during the Philippine Revolution of 1896–1899, the war of the Philippine Independence (1899–1902), Battle of Santa Cruz and the assault of the &quot;tulisanes&quot; (bandits) during the Spanish period. 

Characterized by fertile flat lands situated along the coastal plains of Laguna de Bay, the economic base of the town had been traditionally anchored on two primary industries, namely agriculture and fishing which still remain up to the present. In view of the strategic location of Santa Cruz relative to the other coastal settlements about the lake, trading activities have likewise rooted on the town during those early settlement days. The town proper which has always been the focal point of activities used to be accessible to the other lake-shore areas due to the navigable Santa Cruz River aside from Laguna de Bay itself. Since those early days, water is the principal mode of transportation.

=== World War II ===
The Filipino troops of the pre-war 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and recognized guerrillas also came from the town and was involved in the Second Battle of Santa Cruz on January 26, 1945.

<doc id="1276024" wikidata="Q4793348" url="?curid=1276024" title="Armenians of Romania">
<text>[[Armenians]] have been present in what are now the states of Romania and Moldova for over a millennium, and have been an important presence as traders since the 14th century. Numbering only in the thousands in modern times, they were culturally suppressed in the Communist era, but have undergone a cultural revival since the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

==History==
===Danubian Principalities===
The earliest traces of Armenians in what was later Moldavia are dated by 967 (recorded presence in Cetatea Albă). Early Armenian Diasporas stemmed in the fall of the Bagratuni rule (c. 885–1045) and other disasters, including the 13th-century Mongol invasion.

Armenian expatriates were awarded tax exemptions at different times in the Danubian Principalities&#x27; history. Encouraged to settle as early as the 14th century, they became a familiar presence in towns, usually as the main entrepreneurs of the community – for this, in early modern Botoșani and several other places, Armenians as a guild were awarded political representation and degrees of self-rule. A considerable number of noble families in the Principalities were of Armenian descent. In 1572–1574, John III the Terrible, grandson of Stephen the Great and son of Bogdan III and his Armenian concubine Serpega, was Hospodar (Prince) of Moldavia.

In Bucharest, an Armenian presence was first recorded in the second half of the 14th century – most likely, immigrants from the Ottoman-ruled Balkans, as well as from the area around Kamianets-Podilskyi and towns in Moldavia; throughout the 19th century, a large part of Armenian Bucharesters had arrived from Rousse, in present-day Bulgaria. The Gregorian Armenians were given the right to build a church around 1638 – it was rebuilt and expanded in 1685, but was damaged by the Russian attack during the 1768–1774 war with the Ottomans.

Citizenship was bestowed on the community only with the decision taken by the international protectorate over the two countries (instituted after the Crimean War and the ensuing 1856 Treaty of Paris) to extend civil rights to all religious minorities.

===Transylvania===

Armenians were present from early on in Transylvania, clearly attested in a document issued by Hungarian King Ladislaus IV the Cuman (late 13th century). Here, they were even allowed to found their own trading towns, the most notable one being Gherla, called &quot;Armenopolis&quot;/&quot;Armenierstadt&quot; or &quot;Hayakaghak&quot; (Հայաքաղաք). The second important Armenian town in Transylvania is Dumbrăveni (Elisabethstadt).

Despite their increasing autonomy, the townspeople&#x27;s adherence to the Roman Catholic Church was nonetheless demanded (a conversion begun through the efforts of a Botoșani-born prelate, Oxendius Vărzărescu, 1655–1715), and further submitted to forced integration by the Habsburg monarchy since the 18th century. The Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania is nowadays centered on Gherla, and is placed under the jurisdiction of the Romanian Roman-Catholic Church archbishops of Alba Iulia.

Most Armenians from Transylvania were magyarized in the last half of the 19th century.

===Romania===
After the Armenian genocide of 1915, Romania was the first state to officially provide political asylum to refugees from the area.

Following World War 1, Romania acquired territories including 40,000 Armenians (15,000 in Bessarabia, 20,000 in Transylvania, and 5,000 refugees), thereby raising the Armenian population of Romania to 50,000—they were represented by the Union of Romanian Armenians (headed by Harutiun A. Khentirian who would later become the honorary consul-general of Armenia in Romania in 1922–1924) which sought to gain them minority rights and to facilitate repatriation to Armenia. Despite cosigning the Treaty of Sèvres with Armenia, Romania withheld &quot;de jure&quot; recognition &quot;pending the final determination of Armenia&#x27;s boundaries and ratification of the Turkish peace treaty.&quot;

In 1940 about 40,000 Armenians lived in Romania. Under communist rule, Armenians started to leave the country, and Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s regime eventually closed all Armenian schools.

In the 1990s, after the dissolution of the USSR, the poor economic conditions in Armenia and the military conflicts in the Caucasus, Iraq or Lebanon caused a number of Armenians to seek a better future in Romania as emigrants or travel through Romania to Western Europe or the United States. Since the 1990s, Armenians of Romania enjoyed a cultural revival. As a state-recognized national minority, the Armenians of Romania have 1 seat in the Chamber of Deputies. The Armenians of Romania have 3 newspapers: &quot;Nor Ghiank&quot;, &quot;Ararat&quot; and the Romanian-funded &quot;Lăcașuri de cult&quot;.

==Churches and monasteries==
==Notable Romanians of Armenian descent==
Romanians of Armenian descent have been very active in Romanian political, cultural, academic and social life. Most worthy of mention would be Vazgen I, Catholicos of Armenia, and Iacob Zadig, a general in the Romanian Army during World War I.

<doc id="1276027" wikidata="Q541223" url="?curid=1276027" title="Islam in Jordan">
<text>The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a majority Muslim country with 96% of the population following Sunni Islam while a small minority follow Shiite branches. There are also about 20,000 to 32,000 Druze living mostly in the north of Jordan, even though most Druze no longer consider themselves Muslim. Many Jordanian Muslims practice Sufism. 

The 1952 Constitution grants freedom of religion while stipulating that the king and his successors must be Muslims and sons of Muslim parents. Religious minorities include Christians of various denominations (1%) and even fewer adherents of other faiths. Jordan is a religious and conservative country.

==Islam in Social Life pre-1980s==
Despite a strong identification with and loyalty to Islam, religious practices varied among segments of Jordan&#x27;s population. This unevenness in practice did not necessarily correlate with a rural-urban division or differing levels of education. The religious observance of some Jordanians was marked by beliefs and practices that were sometimes antithetical to the teachings of Islam. Authorities attributed at least some of these elements to pre-Islamic beliefs and customs common to the area.

In daily life, neither rural dwellers nor urbanites were overly fatalistic. They did not directly hold God responsible for all occurrences; rather, they placed events in a religious context that imbued them with meaning. The expression in shari&#x27;a Allah often accompanied statements of intention, and the term bismillah (in the name of Allah) accompanied the performance of most important actions. Such pronouncements did not indicate a ceding of control over one&#x27;s life or events. Jordanian Muslims generally believed that in matters that they could control, God expected them to work diligently.

Muslims have other ways of invoking God&#x27;s presence in daily life. Despite Islam&#x27;s unequivocal teaching that God is one and that no being resembles him in sanctity, some people accepted the notion that certain persons (saints) have baraka, a special quality of personal holiness and affinity to God. The intercession of these beings was believed to help in all manner of trouble, and shrines to such people could be found in some localities. Devotees often visited the shrine of their patron, especially seeking relief from illness or inability to have children.

Numerous spiritual creatures were believed to inhabit the world. Evil spirits known as jinn — fiery, intelligent beings that are capable of appearing in human and other forms — could cause all sorts of malicious mischief. For protection, villagers carried in their clothing bits of paper inscribed with Qur&#x27;anic verses (amulets), and they frequently pronounced the name of God. A copy of the Qur&#x27;an was said to keep a house safe from jinn. The &quot;evil eye&quot; also could be foiled by the same means. Although any literate Muslim was able to prepare amulets, some persons gained reputations as being particularly skilled in prescribing and preparing them. To underscore the difficulty in drawing a fine distinction between orthodox and popular Islam, one only needs note that some religious shaykhs were sought for their ability to prepare successful amulets. For example, in the 1980s in a village in northern Jordan, two elderly shaykhs (who also were brothers) were famous for their abilities in specific areas: one was skilled in warding off illness among children; the other was sought for his skills in curing infertility.

Their reverence for Islam notwithstanding, Muslims did not always practice strict adherence to the five pillars. Although most people tried to give the impression that they fulfilled their religious duties, many people did not fast during Ramadan. They generally avoided breaking the fast in public, however. In addition, most people did not contribute the required proportion of alms to support religious institutions, nor was a pilgrimage to Mecca common. Attendance at public prayers and prayer in general increased during the 1980s as part of a regional concern with strengthening Islamic values and beliefs.

Traditionally, social segregation of the sexes prevented women from participating in much of the formal religious life of the community. The 1980s brought several changes in women&#x27;s religious practices. Younger women, particularly university students, were seen more often praying in the mosques and could be said to have carved a place for themselves in the public domain of Islam.

Although some women in the late 1980s resorted to unorthodox practices and beliefs, women generally were considered more religiously observant than men. They fasted more than men and prayed more regularly in the home. Education, particularly of women, diminished the folk-religious component of belief and practice and probably enhanced observance of the more orthodox aspects of Islam.

==Islamic Revival 1980s onward==
The 1980s witnessed a stronger and more visible adherence to Islamic customs and beliefs among significant segments of the population. The increased interest in incorporating Islam more fully into daily life was expressed in a variety of ways. Women wearing conservative Islamic dress and the headscarf were seen with greater frequency in the streets of urban as well as rural areas; men with beards also were more often seen. Attendance at Friday prayers rose, as did the number of people observing Ramadan.

Women in the 1980s, particularly university students, were actively involved in expressions of Islamic revival. Women wearing Islamic garb were a common sight at the country&#x27;s universities. For example, the mosque at Yarmouk University had a large women&#x27;s section. The section was usually full, and women there formed groups to study Islam. By and large, women and girls who adopted Islamic dress apparently did so of their own volition, although it was not unusual for men to insist that their sisters, wives, and daughters cover their hair in public.

The adoption of the Islamic form of dress did not signify a return to segregation of the sexes or female seclusion. Indeed, women who adopted Islamic clothing often were working women and students who interacted daily with men. They cited a lag in cultural attitudes as part of the reason for donning such dress. In other words, when dressed in Islamic garb they felt that they received more respect from and were taken more seriously by their fellow students and colleagues. Women also could move more readily in public if they were modestly attired. The increased religious observance also accounted for women&#x27;s new style of dress. In the 1980s, Islamic dress did not indicate social status, particularly wealth, as it had in the past; Islamic dress was being worn by women of all classes, especially the lower and middle classes.

Several factors gave rise to increased adherence to Islamic practices. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Middle East region saw a rise of Islamism in response to the economic recession and to the failure of nationalist politics to solve regional problems. In this context, Islam was an idiom for expressing social discontent. In Jordan, opposition politics had long been forbidden, and since the 1950s the Muslim Brotherhood had been the only legal political party. These factors were exacerbated by King Hussein&#x27;s public support for the shah of Iran in his confrontation with Ayatollah Khomeini and the forces of opposition, by continued relations with Egypt in the wake of the 1979 Treaty of Peace Between Egypt and Israel, and by the king&#x27;s support for Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War.

Although Islamic opposition politics never became as widespread in Jordan as in Iran and Egypt, they were pervasive enough for the regime to act swiftly to bring them under its supervision. By the close of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, government-controlled television regularly showed the king and his brother Hasan attending Friday prayers. The media granted more time to religious programs and broadcasts. Aware that the Islamic movement might become a vehicle for expressing opposition to the regime and its policies, and in a move to repair relations with Syria, in the mid-1980s the government began to promote a moderate form of Islam, denouncing fanatical and intolerant forms.

<text>Robert M. &quot;Bob&quot; Gordon (born July 3, 1950) is an American politician serving as a commissioner of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. Prior to being commissioner, Gordon was a Democratic Party politician who served in the New Jersey Senate from January 8, 2008 to April 4, 2018 representing the 38th Legislative District. He also served in the General Assembly from 2004 to 2008.

==Early life and education==
Gordon was born in Paterson and grew up in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political economy from Williams College in 1972, a Master of Public Policy from the University of California, Berkeley, and an MBA in finance and health care management from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1978.

== Career ==
Gordon began his career an analyst in the Congressional Budget Office from 1975 to 1977.

Gordon served on the Fair Lawn Borough Council from 1986 to 1995, on its Planning Board from 1986 to 1995 and was Mayor of Fair Lawn, New Jersey from 1988 to 1991. He was the Fair Lawn Fire Commissioner from 1986 to 1995 and served on the Fair Lawn Ethics Board from 1999 to 2003. During this time he also served as an aide in the New Jersey Office of the Governor from 1990 to 1991. He was also a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1988 and 1992. In 1996, Gordon ran in the Democratic primary for the open Congressional seat in the 9th district but was defeated in a landslide against former Englewood mayor Steve Rothman.

He served on the Democratic State Committee from 1993 to 1998. Gordon is a real estate development consultant in addition to being a state senator.

=== New Jersey Assembly ===
In the 2003 election, Gordon and Joan Voss unseated the incumbents, Green Party candidate Matt Ahearn and Republican Rose Marie Heck, to win the Assembly seats. Bergen County Freeholder and Paramus Councilwoman Connie Wagner replaced Gordon on the Democrats&#x27; 2007 Assembly ticket.

=== New Jersey Senate ===
Gordon was the 2007 Democratic nominee to succeed outgoing Senator Joseph Coniglio and won the seat with 59.9% of the vote. He was re-elected in 2011 and served on the Legislative Oversight Committee (Chair), the Transportation Committee (Vice-Chair), and the Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee.

In the 2013 election, the then-increasingly popular Governor Chris Christie targeted the 38th Legislative District to unseat Gordon. However, Gordon prevailed who said he was &quot;pleased that he&#x27;s on Christie&#x27;s radar screen.&quot; He became one of the leading proponents of increased accountability and transparency at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey after the 2013 Fort Lee Bridgegate Scandal.

Gordon also served as chair of the Senate Transportation Committee and co-chair of a special panel which investigated problems with NJ Transit.

=== Board of Public Utilities ===
Gordon had been a Commissioner of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities from April 2018 through April 2023, when he retired from State service. He was originally appointed by Governor Phil Murphy to fill the Commissioner role.

== Personal life ==
The Democratic lawmaker is married to Gail Balph Gordon, a Republican who served on the staff of Richard Thornburgh, the former Pennsylvania Governor and United States Attorney General, and as a member of Governor Chris Christie&#x27;s campaign finance committee and his transition team. In February, 2013, Gail Gordon joined the Florio Perrucci Steinhardt &amp; Fader law firm, which is headed by former Democratic Governor Jim Florio.

<doc id="1276042" wikidata="Q702322" url="?curid=1276042" title="Koryo Hotel">
<text>The Koryo Hotel (or Pyongyang Koryo Hotel) is the second largest operating hotel in North Korea, the largest being the Yanggakdo Hotel. The Ryugyong Hotel is larger than both, but is not yet operating. The twin-towered Koryo Hotel building is 143 metres (469 ft) tall and contains 43 stories. Erected in 1985 under Kim Il Sung, it was intended to &quot;showcase the glory and strength of the DPRK.&quot;

The hotel is rated five stars by North Korea. A section of the hotel reportedly caught fire on 11 June 2015 due to undisclosed circumstances, leaving the bridge between the two buildings badly damaged.

==Name==
&quot;Koryo&quot; is the name of an early kingdom which is the source of the English name &quot;Korea&quot;. It is also used in the name of the North Korean airline, Air Koryo.

The Koryo Hotel replaced an older hotel of the same name, but in a different location. For a time after 1946, the leader of North Korea&#x27;s Democratic Party Cho Man-sik was kept under house arrest in the older Koryo Hotel.

==Location==

The hotel is situated close to Pyongyang Station in Chung-guyok, central Pyongyang.

==Features==
The hotel&#x27;s extravagance is exemplified by its entryway, which consists of a 9-metre (30 ft) wide jade dragon&#x27;s mouth that leads into an expansive lobby dominated by a mosaic of North Korean cultural symbols. The mosaic tiles make use of a wide variety of precious metals and gemstones underneath low-dispersion glass panes, which are replaced biannually to preserve the mosaic&#x27;s luster.

The hotel has 500 rooms. Rooms are equipped with a mini-bar and TV. Guests have reported power outages within the hotel grounds.
Amenities include a hard currency gift shop, gym, a swimming pool, a revolving restaurant on the 45th floor, a circular bar on the 44th floor and two cinemas; one with 200 seats and one with 70 seats. There is a coffee shop on the ground floor. The hotel also features a billiards room on the second floor and a casino in the basement. The casino offers blackjack, roulette, and slot machines. The casino is staffed by Chinese workers. Amenities do not include the use of the internet.

===Restaurants===
Each tower is topped by a revolving restaurant, however only one is open. The revolving restaurant apparently had a 9 pm closing time but in 2010 it was reported that in recent years the closing time would be extended or relaxed based on the quality of the guests&#x27; tipping. Aside from the single open revolving restaurant, the hotel has four other restaurants including a Japanese restaurant and a Korean BBQ restaurant.

The restaurants are operated by Japanese expatriates and are run as private businesses, but they must pay a fee to the state.

==Guest liberty==
By some reports, guests are prevented by guards from leaving the hotel. However, others report the ability to wander off the hotel grounds. The hotel is a few blocks from the city&#x27;s restaurant district and the Pyongyang Railroad Station.

<text>Antonio Pacchioni (13 June 1665– 5 November 1726) was an Italian scientist and anatomist, who focused chiefly on the outermost meningeal layer of the brain, the dura mater.

&quot;Pacchioni&#x27;s granulations&quot; (or Pacchionian bodies), where the arachnoid layer protrudes through the dura, are named after him (although they are now generally known as arachnoid granulations).

==Biography==
Pacchioni was born in Reggio Emilia, where he later attended university. He received his degree in medicine in 1688, and left for Rome in 1689.

Pacchioni studied medicine at the University of his native city, obtaining his degree on April 25, 1688. The next year he moved to Rome to devote himself to anatomy in particular; he spent his most productive years in Rome. He was a friend and student of Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694), who lived in Rome from 1691 to 1694. First attending the Santo Spirito in Sassia Hospital, he was an assistant physician at the Ospedale della Conzolazione from May 26, 1690 to June 3, 1693, and then remained for six years in Tivoli as the town doctor.

In 1699 Pacchioni returned to Rome and established a successful medical practice. He later became head physician at the Hospital of San Giovanni in Laterano and then at the Ospedale della Consolazione. In Rome, he made the acquaintance of the clinician and botanist Giovanni Maria Lancisi (1654-1720), with whom he collaborated in the publication of the anatomical plates of Eustachius in 1714.

Pacchioni&#x27;s most important works particularly concerned the anatomy and function of the dura mater. His first dissertation on this dates from 1701 on, the most important being Dissertatio epistolaris de glandulis ... (1705) in which he described the arachnoidal granulations that are named after him.

==Career and life==
Pacchioni was a &quot;short man, with oblong face, vivid eye and a rather melancholic temperament&quot; Following the customs of his time, he initially studied philosophy and only later turned to medicine, demonstrating a natural talent for anatomical dissection. He worked under the guidance of Antonio Vallisneri (1661-1730), Professor of Medicine at the University of Padova and member of the Royal Society of London (Vallisneri is also credited with the first description of the anatomical features of Stein Leventhal syndrome). After moving to Rome, he first attended the Ospedaledi S. Spirito in Sassia and then successfully applied for a position as assistant physician at the Ospedale della Consolazione (May 26, 1690), well known at that time for emergency medicine. As stated by Pacchioni himself, this early experience involved the frequent management of head injuries, which aroused his particular interest in brain coverings. Thanks to Malpighi&#x27;s support, in July, 1693, Pacchioni became the town doctor in Tivoli, quickly gaining popular esteem and approval. Here he spent 6 years under the patronage of the Duke of Modena at the Villa d&#x27;Este. Upon his return to Rome, he published in 1701 his first observations on the structure and function of dura mater: &quot;De Dura Meninge Fabrica et Usu Disquisitio Analomica&quot;.

Pacchioni had a great passion for research and a constant devotion to constructive scientific debate, mutual confrontation with colleagues, exchange of experiences, and education of younger colleagues (he often presented candidates in the discussion of their doctoral thesis). Moreover, Pacchioni exhibited a remarkable attention to scientific progress beyond Italy&#x27;s borders as shown by the frequent quotation of foreign authors in his works (Willis and Vieussens among others). Further evidence of his merits is the deferential friendship he shared with great men such as Giambattista Morgagni (1682-1771), Malpighi (1627- 1694), and especially with Lancisi (1654-1720), who requested the collaboration of Pacchioni in the preparation of his famous De Motu Cordis et Aneurismatibus (1728) and in the first edition of the Tabulae Anatomicae (1714) collected by Bartolomeo Eustachio (1500-1574).

In 1700, Pacchioni was on the verge of becoming Lancisi&#x27;s successor for the Chair of Anatomy at the University La Sapienza, upon the recommendation of Lancisi himself. Sadly, he decided to withdraw—formally in deference to his competitor Giorgio Baglivi (1668-1707), but more likely because the latter was known to be a protegé of Pope Innocenzo XII.

The year 1705 was a special time in Pacchioni&#x27;s life: he was appointed &quot;head physician&quot; at the ancient Ospedaledi S. Giovanni in Laterano, and published the original description of arachnoid granulations in his Dissertatio Epistolaris de Glandulis Conglobatis Durae Meningis Humanae. He was fellow of several prestigious academies such as the Accademia delle Scienze of Bologna, Accademia dei Fisiocritici of Siena, and the Accademia Cesareo-Leopoldina de&#x27; Curiosi della Natura of Leipzig; he also attended meetings of the Roman Accademia dell&#x27; Arcadia under the pseudonym of &quot;Euforo Craneo&quot; (&quot;attentive observer of the skull&quot;). He was sometimes asked for consultation as a &quot;police doctor.&quot;

==Final years==
Precarious health forced Pacchioni to accept the less demanding charge of &quot;head physician&quot; at his favorite Ospedale della Consolazione, where he worked until retirement. He was struck by an undetermined disease of the central nervous system (perhaps a tumor or intracranial hematoma) that caused seizures, a right hemiparesis, and progressive mental deterioration. He was attended to by his most trusted colleagues and his old master Vallisneri. Pacchioni died in Rome at 62 years of age.

==Thoughts and works==
Despite his extreme versatility, Pacchioni is best known as an anatomist and a skilled dissector. He made significant contributions to the elucidation of the structure and function of dura mater, investigating its fine structure. Following Malpighi&#x27;s teachings, he &quot;made use of the microscope&quot;, an &quot;advanced technology of his time&quot;, and systematically treated the anatomical specimens by original techniques of maceration into &quot;... strong, sour, salted, sweet, and oily fluids ... &quot;. For example, in the Dissertatio Epistotaris..., Pacchioni pointed out how arachnoid villi swell &quot;... to the size of a millet seed... &quot; after dura is &quot;...soaked for a month first into plain water and then into vinegar...&quot; (recommending frequent renewal of the bath in order to avoid smell!)

The interpretation of Pacchioni&#x27;s morphological findings was adversely influenced by his adherence to the &quot;iatromechanical doctrine,&quot; whereby the function of an organ was merely based on its mechanical activity. Therefore, he believed that dura mater was a special kind of membranous muscle (&quot;musculus suigeneris membranaceus&quot;), comparable to cardiac muscle, made up of several layers of fibers and arranged in three bellies and four tendons; its contractions served to squeeze the glands which, in Malpighi&#x27;s opinion, constituted the cerebral cortex, pushing their secretion along nerve roots? Among Pacchioni&#x27;s findings, we recall the description of the tentorial notch (the so-called &quot;Pacchioni&#x27;s oval foramen&quot;), the observation that dural adherence to the inner table is variable in different areas, and especially the discovery of arachnoid granulations. In 1705, Pacchioni dedicated to Professor Luca Schrok (a German colleague from Augsburg) the &quot;Dissertatio Epistolaris de Glandulis Conglobatis Durae Meningis Hurnanae, indeque Ortis Lymphaticis&quot; and &quot;Piam Meningem produclis.&quot; 

One of his popular papers is written in Latin and illustrated with two figures and remarkable for its scientific rigor, careful report of materials and methods, and frequent quotation of up-to-date international literature. While exploring the internal structure of the superior sagittal sinus, Pacchioni was struck by those minute globular bodies (which he named &quot;glandulae conglo-batae&quot;), each wrapped by its own capsule, clustering on either side of the sinus. Numerous thin filaments, which he thought were lymphatic vessels, seemed to bloom from the &quot;glandulae,&quot; running toward the pia on one side and penetrating dural layers on the other. Therefore, he concluded that his &quot;glandulae&quot; (glands) had the function of secreting lymph to lubricate the sliding movements between brain and meninges during contractions. Although these speculations appear grossly incorrect in the light of present knowledge, new observations seem &quot;to do justice&quot; to Antonio Pacchioni. In a recent study, Go, et al., ~ using enzyme ultracnytochemistry, detected Na+/K + adenosine triphosphatase activity on cap cells of arachnoid villi; they proposed that this biochemical mechanism could contribute to CSF absorption. This assumption implies a &quot;&#x27;secretory&quot; component in CSF absorption along with the already widely accepted mechanisms. It is remarkable to note that, if this single observation is confirmed, we may have to look at arachnoid villi not simply as hydrostatic pressure-gated valves, but as actual secreting structures: that is, as glands or &quot;glandulae,&quot; as Antonio Pacchioni suggested three centuries ago.

<doc id="1276050" wikidata="Q6742048" url="?curid=1276050" title="1969 Malaysian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Malaysia on Saturday, 10 May 1969, although voting was postponed until between 6 June and 4 July 1970 in Sabah and Sarawak. This election marked the first parliamentary election held in Sabah and Sarawak after the formation of Malaysia in 1963.

The elections resulted in the return to power, with a reduced majority, of the ruling Alliance Party, comprising the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the Malayan Chinese Association, and the Malayan Indian Congress. The Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan) and the Democratic Action Party (DAP), which had campaigned against Bumiputra privileges outlined by Article 153 of the Constitution, made major gains in the election. Voter turnout was 73.6%. Opposition won 54 seats in total causing the Alliance to lose its two-thirds majority in the Parliament (two-thirds majority being the majority required to pass most constitutional amendments) for the first time.

The elections also saw Alliance lose its majority in Perak, Selangor and Penang in addition to Kelantan. The result of the election and subsequent reactions would cause widespread race riots also known as the 13 May Incident. As a consequence of this incident, the federal government decided to suspend parliament and government administration was monitored by MAGERAN until 1971. It also marked the end of Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s administration as Prime Minister before he was succeeded by Tun Abdul Razak several months later. Razak would then seek the main purpose to establish the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur.

State elections also took place in 330 state constituencies in 12 (out of 13, except Sabah) states of Malaysia on the same day.

==Results==
===Dewan Rakyat===
Candidates were returned unopposed in 19 constituencies. Voting in one constituency was postponed.

West Malaysia went to the polls on 10 May, while Sabah was scheduled to vote on 25 May and Sarawak on 7 June. The Alliance won eight seats on nomination day being unopposed in some constituencies. Tun Mustapha Datu Harun&#x27;s United Sabah National Organisation (USNO) won 10 out of 16 seats unopposed on nomination day.

The opposition parties&#x27; gain at state level was more shocking to the Alliance Party which not only continued to lose to PAS in Kelantan, but also to political infant Gerakan in Penang. No party commanded an absolute majority in two other states. The Alliance held only 14 out of 24 seats in Selangor and 19 out of 40 in Perak.

The attrition of Malay support was much higher than that of the non-Malays. Malay opposition parties&#x27; vote shares in the peninsula increased drastically from about 15% in 1964 to 25% in 1969 while the support for non-Malay opposition parties remained roughly the same at 26% in both elections. Thanks to the electoral system, however, PAS seats increased from nine to 12 seats only while non-Malay opposition party, DAP, from 1 to 13.

===State Assemblies===
==Aftermath==
Gerakan and DAP held a victory rally in Kuala Lumpur on 12 May. The rally soon turned rowdy, as party members and Malay bystanders started to shout racial epithets at each other. UMNO retaliated with its own rally on 13 May, which soon broke out into full-scale rioting. This event subsequently became known as the 13 May Incident.

<doc id="1276053" wikidata="Q1480604" url="?curid=1276053" title="Château de Pau">
<text>The Château de Pau (, ) is a castle in the centre of the city of Pau, the capital of Pyrénées-Atlantiques and Béarn. It dominates that quarter of the city.

Henry IV of France and Navarre was born here on December 13, 1553, and it was once used by Napoleon as a holiday home during his period of power.

The château has been classified as a &quot;Monument historique&quot; since 1840 by the French Ministry of Culture.
Nowadays, as the Musée national du Château de Pau, it contains a collection of tapestries.

== History ==
===Origins===
Pau Castle was founded in the Middle Ages. First and foremost a military structure, it is a typical fortified castle built on top of the hill overlooking the Gave bounded by the Hédas ravine.

Since its construction, the castle has taken on a symbolic importance: possessing a stockade of piles (&quot;pau&quot;, in Béarnese), it designates, by metonymy, the city itself. These piles, symbolizing loyalty and righteousness, are each like &quot;axis mundi&quot; in a Béarnese version. In the twelfth century Gaston IV of Béarn built three towers at the fortress. They are called Mazères, Billère and Montauser.

===Gaston Fébus===
The fourteenth century was troublesome as the region was torn between the competing claims of the powerful warring enemy kingdoms of France and England. In contrast, the local lords sought to make Béarn united and independent, under a sovereign count. Such a man was the formidable Gaston III, Count of Foix, better known as Gaston Fébus (also spelt Phoebus). He greatly reinforced the fortress&#x27;s defences and added a new 33-metre-high brick tower, defiantly inscribed in Béarnaise: &quot;Febus me fe&quot; (Fébus made me).

===The Kings of Navarre===
During the Renaissance, the installation of the court of Navarre in 1512 significantly altered the appearance of the castle. Originally a fortress, it now became a pleasure residence. Henry II of Navarre resided there with his wife Marguerite d&#x27;Angoulême, sister of Francis I, best known as Marguerite de Navarre, author of The &quot;Heptaméron&quot;. They marked the place with their initials, still present on the walls and ceilings, and great care was taken to maintain and reproduce the initials even over the subsequent restorations.

===Henry IV===
But their grandson gave the castle the fame it has today: not by any architectural endeavor, nor even by his own will. The future Henry IV was born in it on December 13, 1553, and the story did the rest. The fame of the King, baby boy cradled in a turtle shell preserved by Béarn through the vicissitudes of revolutions, gives the castle, which did not see him grow up or die, a particular taste, and the right to claim the honor due those who give birth to supermen. But the real recognition of the King is posthumous, and the castle that he was born in was soon forgotten, except to unite Navarre and Béarn with the Kingdom of France (for which Louis XIII signed the treaty in 1620).

===The restoration===
Louis-Philippe, who would combine the ideals of the Revolution and those of the monarchy, had the idea of restoring the castle of the man who reconciled Catholic and Protestant into a royal residence.

The castle was a gilded prison in 1848 for the emir Abd El-Kader, conquered by France in Algeria. In order that this castle should retain its character, Henricians placed there many &quot;neo-Renaissance&quot; and &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; objects, and a collection of tapestries (16th - 19th century), to recall the halcyon days of the good king. Louis-Philippe, in exile in England, could never stay at this place which was visited by Napoleon III. It is the Renaissance portal through which one enters and which bears the initials of the royal couple of Navarre, founder of the modern castle.

=== The national museum ===
Then the castle became a presidential residence in the Republic. It is currently a national museum which houses the works preserved from the days of Henry IV and especially during the restoration made by Louis-Philippe. The collections are increasing every year around the Henrician theme. It currently hosts over 100,000 visitors annually, making it the most visited heritage site of the French department of Pyrénées-Atlantiques.

<text>Seddon is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Maribyrnong local government area. Seddon recorded a population of 5,143 at the .

Located south of Footscray and north of Yarraville, Seddon was formerly a semi-industrial, working-class suburb. In recent years Seddon has experienced rapid gentrification due to its close proximity to the Melbourne City Centre.

==History==

Originally known as &quot;Belgravia&quot;, Seddon was officially declared a suburb in 1906, named after Richard Seddon, the Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 to 1906, who resided there before he moved to Bendigo and later to New Zealand.

Seddon was, on occasion, considered part of neighbouring Footscray. The original State Bank of Victoria in Charles Street, Seddon used to stamp its Bank Account passbooks as Footscray South Vic. Not unusual, considering Seddon is south of Footscray. However, while central Footscray is one of the main shopping and transport hubs for Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs, Seddon, in contrast, is quiet, leafy and residential.

The main streets of Victoria, Charles and Gamon used to accommodate a tram line that ran through the middle of the Seddon Village. It has since been replaced with central garden beds and tree plantings in the middle of the streets.

Seddon street names were named for monarchs. Reading from west to east, Charles intersects with Alfred, Edward, Henry, James, William, Victoria (which runs parallel to Windsor) and terminates at Albert. 
Seddon Post Office opened on 29 September 1908 and closed in 1976. Seddon West Post Office opened in 1924 and has since been renamed to the Seddon Post Office after its relocation further south on Victoria Street. Seddon shares its postcode with neighbouring Footscray – 3011.

==Community organisations==

The Seddon Community Group with the assistance of the Maribyrnong Council puts on the Seddon Festival each year, closing all the main streets in the village to vehicles for exclusive pedestrian access. Several large band stages are erected on streets throughout the village and traders extend their seating onto the streets for the day. The Seddon Festival plays host to the Seddon Waiters Race, an event in which all of the local cafes and restaurants enter a waiter to compete carrying drinks and food through a short course on the street. The Snapshots of Seddon photography competition is also usually awarded judges prizes at the festival after entrants have had their photos displayed in the windows of the local business for the preceding month for judging of the peoples choice award.

The Seddon Makers Market (formerly Maribyrnong Makers Market) operates throughout the year on the grounds of the Seddon Uniting Church on Gamon Street. Established in 2008, the market is a not-for-profit, community based designer market run by a local volunteer group. The group provides a forum for artists and crafts people to promote and sell handmade wares.

==Sport and activities==

The Seddon Cricket Club has its home ground in the Yarraville Gardens.

Seddon also shares its Australian Rules football team, Yarraville-Seddon, with neighbouring Yarraville. The team competes in the Western Region Football League.

Opposite Seddon Station is the 5th Footscray Scout Group. With programs for children aged 6 to 15, the group is part of Scouts Australia, and meets in a historic hall built in the 1930s.

==Local landmarks==
===Residential architecture===
Residential Seddon consists predominantly of single storey Victorian &#x27;workers cottages&#x27; and Edwardian terrace houses, with some larger double storey early 20th century buildings in the village.

===Public spaces===
Seddon features many small gardens, parks and playgrounds scattered throughout the suburb. Harris Reserve is on the corner of Gamon Street and Thomson Street. Bristow Reserve is a favourite among toddlers and barbecue masters alike and is located on the corner of Pilgrim Street and John Street. Mappin Reserve, the largest green space, can be found between Bell Street and Nicholson Street.

==Public transportation== 

Seddon&#x27;s railway station is on the Werribee and Williamstown railway lines of the Melbourne train network. Seddon Village is most closely serviced by the Middle Footscray station on the Sunbury line, as well as the 223 and 472 bus routes.

==National broadband network==
Most of Seddon is connected to the National Broadband Network (NBN) via fibre optic cabling, replacing the ageing copper network and providing relief for the Footscray copper exchange.

<doc id="1276068" wikidata="Q794106" url="?curid=1276068" title="Azrael (DC Comics)">
<text>Azrael is an alias used by multiple fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The original version, [[Jean-Paul Valley]], was created by Denny O&#x27;Neil, Joe Quesada, and Peter Milligan, and debuted in &quot;Batman: Sword of Azrael&quot; #1 (October 1992). The second character to assume the alias was [[Azrael (DC Comics)|Michael Washington Lane]], in &quot;Azrael: Death&#x27;s Dark Knight&quot; #1 (May 2009). Both iterations are Christian vigilantes and assassins created by the Order of St. Dumas and its derivatives (i.e the Order of Purity), secretive religious organizations seeking to restore justice to Gotham City through religious extremism. They are typically portrayed as antiheroes and reluctant allies of the superhero Batman and the Batman Family, battling forms of manipulations employed by their respective orders, violent tendencies shaped by tragedies in their life, and proving themselves trusted allies to Batman.

Both Jean-Paul Valley and Michael Lane have appeared in associated DC media. Additionally, an original iteration, [[Theo Galavan]], appears in the second season of &quot;Gotham&quot;, portrayed by James Frain.

==Characters==
===Jean-Paul Valley===

Jean-Paul Valley was introduced as the original Azrael in the 1992 four-issue miniseries &quot;Batman: Sword of Azrael&quot;.

He later briefly assumed the identity of Batman in the &quot;&quot; story arc (1993-1994), after Bruce Wayne was severely injured in a fight with Bane.

Then, he starred in the subsequent &quot;Azrael&quot; series.

===Michael Washington Lane===

Michael Lane was originally introduced in &quot;Batman&quot; #665 (June 2007) as the alter-ego of the supervillain Bat-Devil. In &quot;Azrael: Death&#x27;s Dark Knight&quot; #1 (May 2009), the character was re-introduced as Azrael, as part of the &quot;&quot; story arc.

===Others===
A number of other characters besides Valley and Lane have assumed the identity of Azrael in the DC Universe:
* Valley&#x27;s father was the previous Azrael, as seen in &quot;Batman: Sword of Azrael&quot; (in which he was identified as Jean-Paul Valley Sr.). In &quot;Azrael Annual&quot; #1, the character&#x27;s role as Azrael is depicted in more depth, and he is now identified as just Ludovic Valley.
* A Chinese man, supposedly given the same training as Valley and an identical costume, is briefly under the control of the Order. Also, the position of the Order of St. Dumas&#x27; enforcer has been passed on since medieval times.
* Early in the &quot;Azrael&quot; series, another man is supposedly selected and trained in the same way as Valley and the Chinese man to be Valley&#x27;s replacement. He is defeated by Valley and supposedly falls to his death, only to resurface in Gotham City in &quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot; wearing one of Valley&#x27;s &#x27;Batman&#x27; armored costumes and engaging in illegal underground fights after having made a deal with Abra Kadabra (acting on behalf of Neron) for his soul in return for his life.
* An unrelated character also named Azrael was created by Marv Wolfman and José Luis García-López and debuted in &quot;Tales of the Teen Titans&quot; #52 in 1985. This version, whose origins remained a mystery, appeared as a supporting character in the Titans stories in the late 1980s.

==In other media==
===Television===
An original incarnation of Azrael, Theo Galavan, appears in the second season of &quot;Gotham&quot;, portrayed by James Frain. He is a billionaire industrialist, heir apparent of the Order of St. Dumas, brother of Tabitha Galavan, uncle of Silver St. Cloud, benefactor of a criminal group called the &quot;Maniax&quot;, and later mayor of Gotham City. After being exposed and killed by Oswald Cobblepot and Jim Gordon, Theo is later revived by Hugo Strange, but is rendered insane and amnesiac. Under the belief that he is Azrael, an ancient immortal warrior who vanquished the Order&#x27;s enemies, Strange gives Theo armor, a mask, and sword and tasks him with killing Gordon, only for Theo to be killed by Cobblepot and Butch Gilzean via an RPG.

===Video games===
* The Jean-Paul Valley incarnation of Azrael appears as an unlockable playable character in the Nintendo DS version of &quot;Lego Batman: The Videogame&quot;.
* The Jean-Paul Valley and Michael Lane incarnations of Azrael appear as character summons in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.
* The Michael Lane incarnation of Azrael appears as a playable character in the handheld versions of &quot;Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes&quot;.
* The Michael Lane incarnation of Azrael appears in the &quot;&quot; franchise, voiced by Khary Payton.

===Miscellaneous===
The Jean-Paul Ludovic Valley and Jean-Paul Valley Jr. incarnations of Azrael appear in the &quot;Batman: Knightfall&quot; audio drama.

<text>Siniloan, officially the Municipality of Siniloan (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 39,460 people.

Sinilóan is a center of education, commerce and transportation, serving towns in eastern Laguna and some towns from the provinces of Quezon and Rizal. The municipality has active business and trade activities.

==Etymology==
From the early period of Spanish colonialisation, some female inhabitants of the place were milling their palay in their fields. While doing this, some Spaniards came and asked them, &quot;Como se llama esta pueblo?&quot; The natives, not knowing Spanish thought that they were asked what they were doing and one of them answered, &quot;camí po ay gumiguiling&quot;. The Spaniards repeated, &quot;Guiling-Guiling&quot;, to which the natives nodded. Some this place known as &quot;Guiling-Guiling&quot; from 1583 to 1604.

Another story has it that during the later part of the year 1604, three brothers, namely, Juan Puno, Juan Pili, and Juan Puhuwan, migrated into this community. They selected a lot adjacent to the river Río Romelo and divided it equally among themselves. When the parish priest saw the ingenuity of the three brothers in equally dividing the land, he asked the natives how equally was expressed in Tagalog. The natives gave him the expression &quot;Sinloan&quot;. Right then and there, the name Guiling-Guiling was changed to &quot;Siniloang&quot; which meant justice, equality and fairness. The word travelled from mouth to mouth with sound variations. Because of the difficulty of some Spaniards in pronouncing &quot;Siniloang&quot;, the name &quot;Siniloan&quot; struck and became the official name of this town.

The name Siniloan is also believed to have been taken from a legendary story about Luis and Ana, a married couple who chased a wild boar from a place called Luisiana. They ran after that big boar from Luisiana to Cavinti (kapit sa Binti). The people along the way who saw Luis and Ana chasing the boar took pity on them and helped them to catch it. The people chased the boar through the towns of Lumbán, Kalayaan, Loñgos, Paéte, Paquil, and Pañguil until they finally caught the boar in this town by means of the lassoed captivity or Siniloan. Siniloan start on 3 eggs.

==History==
In 1583, Sinilóan came to be as a town. This was the year when Don Juan de Salcedo came to this place and the parish was established jointly by Friar Diégo de Orpesa and Friar Juan de Plasencia. The first stone church was erected in 1733 by a Franciscan Friar, Fr. Melchor de San Antonio. The towns of Santa Maria (formerly Caboan) and Mabitac, also former visitas or barrios of Sinilóan, were separated from the town in 1602 and 1613, respectively. Calumpang, a barrio later known as the town of Famy, was separated from the town two centuries later.

In 1903, Famy and Pangil were consolidated with Siniloan. In 1910, Famy separated to become a town once again. Pangil was also separated.

<text>Gary U.S. Bonds (born Gary Levone Anderson; June 6, 1939) is an American rhythm and blues and rock and roll singer, known for his hits &quot;New Orleans&quot; and &quot;Quarter to Three&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Bonds lived in Norfolk, Virginia, in the 1950s when he began singing publicly in church and with a group called the Turks. He joined record producer Frank Guida&#x27;s small Legrand Records label where Guida chose Anderson&#x27;s stage name, U.S. Bonds, in hopes that it would be confused with a public service announcement advertising the sale of government bonds and thereby garner more DJ attention. His first three singles and first album, &quot;Dance &#x27;Til Quarter to Three&quot;, were released under the U.S. Bonds name, but people assumed it was the name of a group. To avoid confusion, subsequent releases, including his second album &quot;Twist Up Calypso&quot;, were made under the name Gary (U.S.) Bonds. The parentheses were discarded in the 1970s.

&quot;Quarter to Three&quot; sold one million records, earning a gold disc. Subsequent hits, under his modified name, included &quot;School Is Out&quot; (#5), &quot;Dear Lady Twist&quot; (#9), &quot;School Is In&quot; (#28) and &quot;Twist, Twist Senora&quot; (#9) in the early 1960s. In a 1963 tour of Europe, he headlined above the Beatles. His hits featured solos by the saxophonist Gene Barge.

&quot;Quarter to Three&quot; appears on The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list.

In the early 1980s, Bonds had a career resurgence with two albums, both of them recorded with Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt, and the E Street Band. &quot;Dedication&quot; was released in 1981, and &quot;On the Line&quot; followed in 1982. The albums spawned several hits including &quot;This Little Girl&quot; (his comeback hit in 1981, which reached No. 11 on the pop chart in Billboard and No. 5 on the mainstream rock chart), &quot;Jolé Blon&quot; and &quot;Out of Work&quot;.

Bonds released an album in 2004 called &quot;Back in 20&quot;, the title referencing his repeated sporadic pop-ups of popularity (his first hits were in the 1960s, then again in the 1980s, and another significant album in the early 2000s, each 20-odd years apart). The album features guest appearances by Springsteen and Southside Johnny.

In 2009, he released a new album, &quot;Let Them Talk&quot;, and toured the UK as a special guest of Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings. In 2010, Bonds contributed duet vocals on the song &quot;Umbrella in My Drink&quot; on Southside Johnny&#x27;s album &quot;Pills and Ammo&quot;.

While Bonds is mostly known for achievements within rhythm and blues and rock and roll, some of his songs are equally at home in other genres; for example, &quot;She&#x27;s All I Got&quot;, co-written by Jerry Williams, Jr. (better known as Swamp Dogg), was nominated for the Country Music Association&#x27;s &quot;Song of the Year&quot; in 1972 when it was a big hit for Johnny Paycheck. (Freddie North also charted his only pop hit with a soul cover of the same song.) Bonds is also a 1997 honoree of the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation. He is an accomplished golfer and often plays celebrity PGA Tour events.

The series was broadcast in June the following year when the UK viewing public first saw Eyo as Denny Blood in a pink PVC suit dancing to the &quot;N-Trance&quot; remix of &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; by the Bee Gees.

===&quot;Bad Girls&quot;===
At the end of the sixth series (in which Eyo did not appear), the character of Denny Blood was voted the sixth favourite inmate on &quot;Bad Girls: Most Wanted&quot;. Denny&#x27;s tragic upbringing, lead to the touching and tragic storylines with her mother, Jessie Devlin (played by Denise Black), and the relationship with stand-in mother Yvonne Atkins (Linda Henry). Blood also met the love of her life Shaz Wiley (Lindsey Fawcett), who died at the end of Series 4. Denny was devastated but found comfort in painting and was last seen being transferred to an open prison to serve the rest of her sentence. Just before &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was axed, the &quot;Bad Girls&quot;&#x27; creators were going to ask Eyo to reprise her role as Denny.

During this time, Eyo also appeared in the film &quot;The Low Down&quot;, in an episode of &quot;Urban Gothic&quot; and in &quot;Tube Tales&quot;. Since leaving &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, Eyo appeared in &quot;Holby City&quot; twice, as two separate characters, and the BBC daytime drama &quot;Doctors&quot;. Eyo plays Gaynor Harvey in Shed Productions drama &quot;Bombshell&quot;. However, &quot;Bombshell&quot; still has not been shown in the UK, but has aired in New Zealand.

===Theatre===
Eyo studied at the Court Theatre Training Company in London, graduating in 1996. Since her graduation Eyo has also performed at various theatres including the Royal Court Theatre, Theatre Royal (Nottingham), Theatre 503 and the Everyman (Liverpool). She also performed in the critically acclaimed play &quot;Any Which Way&quot;.

===&quot;Emmerdale&quot;===
In October 2011, Eyo began appearing in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; as Ruby Haswell, the lesbian partner of Ali Spencer (Kelli Hollis). Eyo&#x27;s role ended on 6 August 2015 when her character died in a helicopter crash.

==Personal life==
Eyo is a pescatarian. She is a supporter and patron of The Proud Trust, an LGBT charity that provides services and support for young people.

==Functions and responsibilities==
As well as undertaking basic research, and operating the national geological hazards monitoring network (GeoNet) and the National Isotope Centre (NIC),

GNS Science contracts its services to various private groups (notably energy companies) both in New Zealand and overseas, as well as to central and local government agencies, to provide scientific advice and information.

GNS Science has its head office in Avalon, Lower Hutt, with other facilities in Gracefield, Dunedin, Wairakei, Auckland and Tokyo.

==History==
GNS Science was known as the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (IGNS) from 1992 to 2005. Originally part of the New Zealand Government&#x27;s Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), it was established as an independent organisation when the Crown Research Institutes were set up in 1992.

In late September 2024, GNS Science confirmed that 59 roles would be cut, amounting to ten percent of its workforce. In addition, 37 new roles would be created. This was part of the Sixth National Government&#x27;s public sector job cuts.

<doc id="1276102" wikidata="Q5687926" url="?curid=1276102" title="Hazel Hawke">
<text>Hazel Susan Hawke (née Masterson, 20 July 192923 May 2013) was the first wife of Bob Hawke, the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia. She married him in 1956, and supported him throughout his prime ministership (1983–1991); they divorced in 1995. She worked in social policy areas, and was an amateur pianist and a patron of the arts. After she was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, she made public appearances in order to raise awareness of the disease.

==Biography==
Hazel Masterson was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1929. She met her future husband Bob Hawke at a church fellowship in Perth. They married on 3 March 1956. They lived in Melbourne from 1958 to 1983, including during his term as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (1969-1980). Bob spent much of his time in Canberra after his election to Parliament in 1980. After he became prime minister on 11 March 1983, the family lived in The Lodge in Canberra, until Hawke was replaced as prime minister by Paul Keating in December 1991.

During their marriage, Bob Hawke had an affair with Blanche d&#x27;Alpuget in the 1970s. Hawke proposed to his mistress in 1978, but later withdrew the offer saying that a divorce from Hazel could cost Hawke three percent (3%) of the vote to elect the latter to a safe seat. D&#x27;Alpuget was initially so upset at Hawke&#x27;s decision not to leave Hazel that she considered either assassinating him or taking her own life, but they reconciled and remained friends; so much so that she became his official biographer. From 1980 to 1982 d&#x27;Alpuget worked closely with Hawke in preparing his 1982 biography. In 1988 Hawke and d&#x27;Alpuget resumed their affair but he remained ostensibly committed to his wife during his prime ministership. After he left office in 1991, he and Hazel announced their separation and divorced in 1994. Hawke and d&#x27;Alpuget married in 1995. Bob Hawke formally apologised for the toll the divorce and subsequent remarriage took on the family.

Hazel had four children with Bob Hawke: Susan Pieters-Hawke (born 1957), Stephen (born 1959), Rosslyn (born 1960) and Robert Jr, who died in his infancy. Hazel and Bob also had an illegal termination before they were married to allow Bob the best chance of getting his Rhodes scholarship, which was only conferred to unwed candidates.

==Views and interests==
Hawke acted as a prominent pro-choice advocate in Australia, often drawing on her personal experience of having an illegal abortion in 1952 so that her future husband Bob Hawke could further his education at the University of Oxford.

She wrote books, such as &quot;My Own Life: An Autobiography&quot; (copyright 1992) and &quot;A Little Bit of Magic: Thoughts For Women&quot; (copyright 1994).

Hawke was an excellent pianist. In 1990, she was one of the three soloists in Mozart&#x27;s Concerto in F for Three Pianos and Orchestra, K. 242, the others being Duncan Gifford and Rebecca Chambers. They played at the Sydney Opera House with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under John Hopkins. The performance was recorded and is currently available to purchase.

She was the inaugural Patron of the Kendall National Violin Competition, and later the Patron Emeritus.

Hawke was elected as a republican delegate to the 1998 Constitutional Convention.

==Honours==

In June 2001 she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia. The citation read: &quot;For service to the community, particularly through the promotion of the reconciliation process, support for continued improvement in the quality of children&#x27;s television, as a contributor to the preservation of heritage items, and involvement with environmental and wildlife preservation groups&quot;.

==Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and death==
On 3 November 2003, the ABC aired an episode of &quot;Australian Story&quot; in which Hawke publicly revealed that she was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Her family had noticed significant short-term memory loss, leading to the diagnosis in 2001. She had been reluctant to go public about the illness she called the &#x27;Big A&#x27;, but eventually did so to publicise a fund for supporting Alzheimer&#x27;s sufferers that she had jointly set up with Alzheimer&#x27;s Australia.

In 2004, Hazel Flynn and Hawke&#x27;s daughter Susan Pieters-Hawke published a book, &quot;Hazel&#x27;s Journey: A personal experience of Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot;, describing the previous decade of Hawke&#x27;s life and the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s. At the book launch on 1 November 2004, Pieters-Hawke revealed that her mother had reached the mid-stages of the disease and was now suffering from quite severe short-term memory loss. That year the Hazel Hawke Dementia and Care Fund was established. Hawke&#x27;s granddaughter Sophie Pieters-Hawke launched an education kit for schoolchildren about Alzheimers in 2007.

In August 2009, she was placed in high level care. On 23 May 2013, she died from complications associated with the disease. She was 83 years old. Her family had been by her side in her last days. Public tributes were paid to her by the prime minister, Julia Gillard and the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce. A state memorial service was held for her at the Sydney Opera House on 25 June 2013, attended by five prime ministers (Hawke, Keating, Howard, Rudd and Gillard), the Governor-General, and a range of state leaders and other federal politicians.

<doc id="1276111" wikidata="Q1925762" url="?curid=1276111" title="Green Line (Montreal Metro)">
<text>The Green Line (, ), also known as Line 1 (), is one of the four lines of the Montreal Metro in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The line runs through the commercial section of downtown Montreal underneath Boulevard de Maisonneuve, formerly . It runs mainly on a northeast to southwest axis with a connection to the Orange and Yellow Lines at Berri-UQAM, and with the Orange Line west of downtown at Lionel-Groulx.

The section between Atwater and Frontenac was part of the initial network; the line was extended to Honoré-Beaugrand in 1976 to provide easy access to 1976 Summer Olympics sites. It was extended to Angrignon in 1978. All but three stations — De L&#x27;Église, , and Charlevoix — are side platform stations.

==History==
On November 3, 1961, Montreal City Council approved an initial Metro network in length. The main line, or Line 1 (Green Line) was to pass between the two most important arteries, Saint Catherine and Sherbrooke streets, more or less under the De Maisonneuve Boulevard. It would extend between the English-speaking west at Atwater station and French-speaking east at .

Construction of the first two lines began May 23, 1962, under the supervision of the Director of Public Works, Lucien L&#x27;Allier. On August 6, 1963, it was agreed that the under construction line would be extended to Square-Victoria and Bonaventure stations, after construction costs for tunnels were lower than expected.

The first stations, found on the section between Atwater and Papineau, opened on October 14, 1966. Several smaller sections were delayed by several months. On December 19, 1966, the line was further extended from Papineau to Frontenac, and two days later came the stopover Beaudry between Berri-UQAM and Papineau. On December 20, 1967, Frédéric Back completed his art piece &quot; L&#x27;histoire de la musique à Montréal&quot; (&quot;The history of music in Montreal&quot;) in Place-des-Arts station. This commissioned piece was the first artwork completed in the Metro system.

The construction of the second phase began in 1971, when Montreal was awarded the bid to host the 1976 Summer Olympics. The goal was to have the ability to transport visitors from downtown to the Olympic Park in the east end. The opening of the section between Frontenac and Honoré-Beaugrand took place on June 6, 1976, six weeks before the start of the Summer Olympics. Green Line trains inaugurated an autopilot feature on November 8, 1976.

The third expansion phase, between Atwater and Angrignon, came into operation on September 3, 1978.

In the 2010s and 2020s, renovation work and the installation of elevators took place at many stations on the Green Line. , ten stations on the line are accessible, including both interchange stations at Berri-UQAM and Lionel-Groulx.

In 2024, following years of studies, the STM&#x27;s parent agency, the ARTM, in conjunction with the Ministère des Transports et de la Mobilité Durable du Québec and the City of Montreal began conducting surveys regarding a possible extension of the Green Line westwards towards Lachine.

== Service ==

=== Operation hours and frequency ===
The Green Line operates between 5:30 a.m. and 12:35 a.m on weekdays and Sunday, and between 5:30 a.m. and 1:05 a.m on Saturday. Trains arrive at stations every 2 to 5 minutes during peak periods, every 3 to 8 minutes during off peak periods, and every 6 to 10 minutes at weekends.

=== Rolling stock ===

At the line&#x27;s opening in 1966, MR-63 cars were used on the Green Line. Upon the introduction of the MR-73 cars on the Green Line in 1976, the older MR-63 cars were used on the Orange Line. From the early-1980s to 2018, MR-63 cars were again used on the Green Line.

With the introduction of the newer MPM-10 trains (also known as Azur) from 2016 on the Orange Line, the Green Line is now primarily served by both the MR-73 and MPM-10 cars. The MR-63 trains were fully retired on June 21, 2018. As of December 2021, all 71 Azur train sets had been delivered. Of these, 26 Azur train sets run on the Green Line.

In the 2020s, work to order new rolling stock to replace the MR-73 trains began. The STM also noted that to increase the capacity of the Green Line by 37%, works to upgrade garages and signalling systems would also be required.

<text>Kalonymus Haberkasten was a rabbi and Talmudist in sixteenth century Poland. He is well known as the rosh yeshiva of many great rabbis including Rabbi Solomon Luria, who married his daughter Lipka.

Haberkasten was rosh yeshiva in Lviv, and was later the first rabbi of the city of Ostroh, Volhynia. He left Ostroh to assume the position of rosh yeshiva in Brest and Luria succeeded him in Ostroh. Haberkasten then went to Eretz Yisroel/Ottoman Syria, in about 1560.

Haberkasten was also a Kabbalist and was known to have made the acquaintance of the great Kabbalists in the Holy Land, including Rabbi Chaim Vital.

<doc id="1276118" wikidata="Q1815020" url="?curid=1276118" title="Alabama language">
<text>Alabama, also known as Alibamu, () is a Native American language, spoken by the Alabama-Coushatta tribe of Texas. It was once spoken by the Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town of Oklahoma, but there are no more Alabama speakers in Oklahoma. It is a Muskogean language, and is believed to have been related to the Muklasa and Tuskegee languages, which are no longer extant. Alabama is closely related to Koasati and Apalachee, and more distantly to other Muskogean languages like Hitchiti, Chickasaw and Choctaw.

==History==
The Alabama first encountered Europeans when Hernando de Soto arrived in 1540. (See here for other de Soto contactees) In the 18th century, the French arrived on the Gulf Coast and built a fort at what became Mobile, Alabama.

The &quot;Alibamu&quot; and &quot;Koasati&quot; tribes were part of the Creek Confederacy. They had less contact with British settlers than other Creek tribes did. They were the first to leave when British settlers swarmed into the area by the middle of the 18th century, after the land was ceded by the French following the British victory in the French and Indian War. Under pressure as well by Native American enemies, the Alabama and Coushatta tribes wanted to avoid the powerful Choctaw in present-day Mississippi. They moved into territories of future states, first into Louisiana and then into Texas.

In 1795, the Coushatta arrived in the Big Thicket area of East Texas. In 1805, nearly 1,000 Alabama came to Tyler County&#x27;s Peach Tree Village in East Texas. The two tribes developed a strong friendship as they roamed and hunted their new land together. In the early 19th century, the Texas Congress granted each tribe two strips of land along the Trinity River. Their land was soon taken over by European-American settlers, leaving them homeless. Sam Houston, the governor of Texas, recommended that the state purchase for the Alabamas. Although money was appropriated to buy for the Coushatta, the land was never bought. Either through marriage or special permission, many Coushatta went to live on the land given to the Alabama. Other Coushatta had stayed in an area in southern Louisiana near the Red River. Many of their descendants are enrolled members of the federally recognized Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana.

Alabama and Coushatta towns were divided into &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot; towns. The &quot;white&quot; towns were responsible for keeping the peace and for providing refuge, while the &quot;red&quot; towns were responsible for conducting military campaigns. Though they had &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot; towns, the Alabama-Coushatta thought of themselves as a peace-loving people.

By 1820, there were three main Alabama towns and three large Coushatta towns in east Texas, in the region known as the Big Thicket. In 1854, the Alabama were given in Polk County. The following year, , also in Polk County, were given to the Coushattas. The Coushatta claim was disputed by white settlers in 1859. When the Coushatta lost the land claim, the Alabama invited them to live on their land claim.

The federal government approved a large grant in 1928 to purchase additional land near the reservation; it was granted to the &quot;Alabama and Coushatta tribes.&quot; Since that time, the reservation has officially been known as “Alabama-Coushatta&quot;.

Origin myths focus on the interconnectedness of the tribes. One myth states that the two tribes sprouted from either side of a cypress tree. Another legend was recorded in 1857 from , one of the oldest Creeks in Indian Territory. He said that the tribes “sprang out of the ground between the Cohawba and Alabama Rivers.” The symbol of the Alabama-Coushatta tribe comes from pre-contact Mississippian culture: two intertwined woodpeckers, now symbolic of the connection between the two tribes.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
There are fourteen consonant phonemes in Alabama.
 is apico-alveolar, . The voiceless stops are typically fortis and unlike in many other Southeastern languages they are not voiced between vowels. All consonants can occur geminated. The post-alveolar affricate is realized as when it occurs as the first member of a consonant cluster and the geminate is realized as . The only voiced obstruent in Alabama is , which is realized as when it occurs in coda (syllable final) position. The geminate is realized as . The two nasal phonemes become velar before the velar stop . In syllable-final position, is often realized as lengthening of the preceding vowel.

===Vowels===
There are three vowel qualities, . Vowel length is distinctive. Vowels can be nasalized in certain morphological contexts.

===Prosody===
In Alabama, the final syllable generally carries the primary stress, except in the case of certain grammatical operations which move the stress. There is also a pitch accent system with two contrastive tones: high-level and high-falling. The two phonemic tones have several different allophonic realizations depending on vowel length and neighboring consonants.

==Revitalization efforts==
Since January 2024, the Alabama–Coushatta Tribe of Texas has engaged in a revitalization and documentation effort in partnership with the WOLF (Working on Language in the Field) Lab at Harvard University, with a five-year goal &quot;to document the language, study its grammar and lexicon, and produce educational resources for the Alabama-Coushatta community.&quot;

<doc id="1276123" wikidata="Q746928" url="?curid=1276123" title="Gerbera jamesonii">
<text>Gerbera jamesonii is a species of flowering plant in the genus &quot;Gerbera&quot; belonging to the basal Mutisieae tribe within the large Asteraceae (or Compositae) family. It is indigenous to South Eastern Africa and commonly known as the Barberton daisy, the Transvaal daisy, and as Barbertonse madeliefie or Rooigousblom in Afrikaans. It was the first species of Gerbera to be the subject of a scientific description, studied by J. D. Hooker in &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot; in 1889.

==Etymology==
The genus was named in honour of German botanist and medical doctor Traugott Gerber (1710 — 1743).

The &quot;Gerbera jamesonii&quot; was named in honour of Robert Jameson, who collected the plant near Barberton. The species epithet was proposed by the prominent South African botanist Harry Bolus, but first published by Richard Wills Adlam in 1888, so should be ascribed to him.

==Description==
&quot;Gerbera jamesonii&quot; is a tufted perennial herb with the naked flowering scapes up to 75 cm high. Petiolate, deeply undulating or lobed leaves are 15–42 (up to 68) cm long and 4–14 cm wide, gathered in rosette. The plant produces spectacular flowers (capitula) of 4–5 cm in diameter with normally orange-red (rarely yellow, orange, white, pink) ray florets. It flowers from September to December, reproduces asexually. The seeds have a pappus of bristles.

==Distribution==
&quot;Gerbera jamesonii&quot; is endemic to Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Eswatini. The plant is introduced into several countries of Latin America, Equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia.

==Ecology==
The species grows from 500 to 1670 m above sea level on rocky slopes in woodland, usually in some shade or under bushes and trees. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects. The seeds are light and easily dispersed by wind.

==Uses==
The species is the ancestor of all cultivated forms of Gerbera, or they originate from the cross &quot;Gerbera jamesonii&quot; and &quot;Gerbera viridifolia&quot;, originally made by R. I. Lynch in Cambridge, England about 1890. He named the hybrid as &quot;Gerbera × cantebrigiensis&quot;, known today as &quot;Gerbera × hybrida&quot;. Nowadays thousands of cultivars exist and they are the important article of trade belonging to the most important ornamental crops in the world together with rose, chrysanthemum, carnation, lily and tulip. The popular cultivars include &quot;Sazou&quot;, &quot;Sangria&quot;, &quot;Rosalin&quot;, &quot;Pink Elegance&quot;, &quot;Tropic Blend&quot;, &quot;Piton&quot;, &quot;Winter Queen&quot;, &quot;Savannah&quot;, &quot;Primrose&quot; and many others. They are propagated by tissue culture and by seeds.
==In culture==
The flag and coat of arms of the Province of Mpumalanga include a depiction of this flower.

==Pests==
===Fungi===
* Foot rot caused by &quot;Phytophthora tentaculata&quot;
* Root rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium irregulare.
* Grey mildew caused by Botrytis cinerea
* White powdery mildew caused by Golovinomyces cichoracearum
* Leaf blight caused by Alternaria alternata, A. citri, A. tennuisssima.
* Leaf spots caused by Ascochyta gerberae, Gloeosporium spp. and other fungi.

===Insects===
* Plant lice Aphids.

<text>The Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy of Argentina (Spanish: Escuela Superior de Mecánica de la Armada, commonly referred to by its acronym ESMA) has gone through three major transformations throughout its history. Originally ESMA served as an educational facility of the Argentine Navy. The original ESMA was a complex located at 8151 Libertador Avenue, in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, in the &quot;barrio&quot; of Núñez. Additionally, It was the seat of U.T.3.3.2—Unidad de Tareas (Task Unit) 2 of G.T.3.3 [es].

However, ESMA later operated as an illegal, secret detention center for opponents of the 1976–1983 military dictatorship, described as &quot;subversives&quot; during what was described as the Dirty War. The military took the babies born to mothers imprisoned there, suppressed their true identities, and allowed military families and associates of the regime to illegally adopt them. The Unidad de Tareas (Task Unit) was responsible for thousands of instances of forced disappearance, torture, and murder during this time. ESMA was the largest detention center of its kind during the Dirty War.

The ESMA building has been converted into a memorial museum to show and honor those who were &quot;disappeared&quot; during Argentina&#x27;s Dirty War. The National Congress passed a law on 5 August 2004 that converted the ESMA complex into a museum, the Space for Memory and for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (&quot;Espacio para la Memoria y para la Promoción y Defensa de los Derechos Humanos&quot;). On 10 June 2014 the Museo Malvinas was inaugurated in the ESMA campus, a museum about the islands disputed and fought over by the United Kingdom (calling them Falkland Islands) and Argentina (Islas Malvinas).

The site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2023 under the name &#x27;ESMA Museum and Site of Memory – Former Clandestine Center of Detention, Torture and Extermination&#x27;.

In 2001, the School, once again legitimate, was renamed Escuela de Suboficiales de la Armada (ESSA; English: Navy Petty-Officers&#x27; School), and moved in 2005 to the Puerto Belgrano Naval Base, 28 km from the city of Bahía Blanca, and about 600 km southwest of Buenos Aires.

==History==

===Functions and authorities===

====Legitimate====

According to the ESSA Web site, in 1897 the &quot;Escuela de Aprendices Mecánicos de la Armada&quot; (Navy Apprentice Mechanics School) was founded in premises that are now the Historical Naval Museum of Tigre, in Buenos Aires Province. In 1900 the School moved to naval workshops in Dársena Norte; in 1902 it became &quot;Escuela de Aprendices Mecánicos y Foguistas&quot; (Apprentice Mechanics and Stokers School). Two years later it became &quot;Escuela de Mecánicos de la Armada&quot;, and in 1911 &quot;Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada&quot;. In 1928 it moved to its later notorious premises, designed by the architect Raúl J. Álvarez, on Blandengues street (now Avenida del Libertador), between Arroyo Medrano and the extension of Deheza street. Once again a legitimate educational establishment, it was renamed &quot;Escuela de suboficiales de la Armada&quot; in 2001, and moved to Puerto Belgrano in 2005, merging the NCO schools of the Argentina Marines and the Argentine Naval Aviation in the process into one institution.

Other sources say that the School was founded in 1924, on land granted that year by the Municipality of Buenos Aires to the Ministry of the Navy by a decree that year, during the presidency of Marcelo T. de Alvear. Under the terms of the decree, it was to revert to the city if it ceased to be a military educational establishment. The School of Mechanics, Naval War School, and Officers&#x27; Mess were built on the land.

Each year about 10,000 youths signed up to enter as regular students, of whom around half were admitted and given scholarships for courses of study such as electronics, aeronautics, management, marine engineering (&quot;mecánico naval&quot;), radio operation, meteorology, and oceanography. The students lived in the complex from Monday through Friday, taking 8 to 10 hours of classes per day. The degrees could be completed in up to three years of studies, with the students receiving the degree of &quot;técnico&quot; (&quot;technician&quot;), with the option of continuing either as naval servicemen, professional army, or air force NCOs or working elsewhere either in the public or private sector.

The main entrance opens onto the central pavilion, where the authorities&#x27; offices were located. A covered patio there was used to show movies to the student body. To the left of this building was petty officers&#x27; housing, and further off and separated, the officers&#x27; housing, where the clandestine detention center operated during the 1976-1983 military dictatorship. To the right of the central pavilion were the checkpoint, the military guard building, and the Naval War School (&quot;Escuela de Guerra Naval&quot;).

Behind, at the rear, were the dormitories and, across Avenida Lugones, the institution&#x27;s sports field. On the perimeter of the school were checkpoints which were staffed by the students in rotating shifts, at least one week per year for each student.

In 1982, 230 final-year students of the ESMA were drafted to fight in the Falklands War; some of them died in the sinking of the ARA &quot;Belgrano&quot; and the attack on ARA &quot;Sobral&quot;.

In 1998, president Carlos Menem ordered the move of the School to the Puerto Belgrano base, and the use of the old campus as a museum. It was granted the name ESSA in 1999 as the by now sole NCO school of the Navy and continues to function in the Puerto Belgrano base.

===Etymology and usage during the Dirty War===

Almost 5,000 people were abducted and held in the original ESMA campus in its active participation in the Dirty War between 1976-1983; all except 150 were killed during or after interrogation and torture. When announcements were made that prisoners were to be &quot;transferred&quot;, people came to understand they were going to be executed. The prisoners were taken to the basement, sedated, and then killed, some by shooting, others in death flights: they were flown over the Atlantic Ocean or the Río de la Plata and pushed out of the aircraft. These are only some examples of the many treatments that prisoners of the ESMA were forced to experience during the kidnappings that forced them into clandestine detention centers.

====Extrajudicial detention center====

The ESMA was used as a detention center from the very start of the 1976 dictatorship: on 24 March, the day of the coup d&#x27;état, several people kidnapped by the Armed Forces were taken there.

Task Unit 3.2.2 was led by Rear-Admiral Rubén Jacinto Chamorro and Captain Carlos Acosta Ambone. Jorge Vildoza has been identified by survivors as the second-in-command of ESMA. Among the Task Unit&#x27;s ranks were Jorge Eduardo Acosta, Alfredo Astiz, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo and Adolfo Scilingo, who became notorious as torturers. Astiz was known as the &quot;Blond Angel of Death&quot;. Its chaplain during 1977 was Father Alberto Ángel Zanchetta. It was in charge of the city of Buenos Aires proper and the northern part of the metropolitan area (Gran Buenos Aires). Officers in charge were under strict orders not to reveal their identities or military affiliation when capturing prisoners.

Between 1976 and 1978, the group was ultimately under the orders of Navy Commander-in-Chief Emilio Eduardo Massera. Massera had reportedly been present when the unit was set up, gave an opening speech to the officers, and personally participated in the first illegal detentions.

====Layout of the ESMA====

Once kidnapped, it was very rare that these prisoners would return home, leaving loved ones wondering if they would ever see their family members or friends again. During the beginning stages of the Dirty War, Argentinians living in Buenos Aires were unaware that the building that once housed a school had been transformed into a center for punishing &quot;subversion&quot;. Once the prisoners had arrived to this new &quot;renovation&quot;, their basic human rights would be ignored. Instead, they were taken to certain floors depending on their status of punishment in an effort to dehumanize the victims. The basement contained interrogation rooms and a station meant for taking and maintaining photographs of each of the prisoners. These photos would allow victims to be recorded, providing an accurate count today as to the five thousand people who died due to the treatment within this camp. The first floor was staged as an operation room for the leaders of the torture to plan, execute, and continue their efforts to punish the prisoners. The second and third floors were adequately furnished and kept, as these were the floors where the officers lived and slept. These officers were committed to torturing the dissidents, contributing twenty four hours, seven days a week of fear for the victims who never knew when the next hit would happen. Also on the third floor, extending to the fourth floor, was an area known as the &quot;capucha&quot;, or hood. This was where prisoners were kept, and this was where conditions were purposefully kept dark and hopeless.

====Who became &quot;los&quot; &quot;desaparecidos/&quot;the disappeared?====
There were certain types of individuals within Argentinian society who were to be kidnapped and removed from it. Stories show, for example, that there was a disproportionate number of Jews taken in custody, shedding light on anti-Semitic victimization. Another group targeted included the people who potentially supported a different government, opposing the current junta and military dictatorship of Argentina. If there was any suspicion that Argentinians were meeting secretly and consistently to resist General Jorge Rafael Videla and his regime, the government would kidnap these people and place them in detention centers such as the ESMA. This would serve as a lesson to incite fear within other members of the community who were also against the current governmental structure of Argentina. Upon being kidnapped, for example, many kidnappers would interrogate the prisoners about why they were opposing the Argentinian dictatorship and spreading a new political ideology, disregarding the fact of whether or not this was actually the case.

====Survivor stories of the ESMA====
A few victims that survived and escaped the ESMA have made it a priority to share their experiences of the torture and human rights infractions they faced while living in this center.

=====Ana María Martí=====
One detainee who survived, Ana María Martí, has related some of the horrific treatment she faced while in the confines of the ESMA. By the time she was captured, information was out that this torture center was something to fear. When she was kidnapped, the officers who snatched her laughed at the fear she had at the mention of the ESMA. Once she arrived, her stories telling her torture resembled the other stories that have been told by those lucky enough to survive. The main goal of the ESMA officers was to inflict as much pain as was possible, testing every victim&#x27;s capability of surviving amidst deathly circumstances. Just within the basement floor of the interrogation methods, victims were subjugated to electric shocks, humiliating treatments, and removal of genitalia and other organs of the human body.

The &quot;capucha&quot; of the ESMA was another terrifying area within this clandestine detention center. After the initial torturing and interrogations, prisoners were chained on the third floor and left alone while hooded (hence the name of the &quot;capucha&quot;). They were left in complete darkness with no communication, forced to be isolated in another way to instigate panic and fear for the prisoners. Eventually, night and day turned into one continual nightmare once prisoners became more veteran members of this torture site. Ana María Martí survived these horrid conditions, but she witnessed many other of her fellow victims suffer and die at the hands of the officers. She remarked that prisoners would begin to know when someone was about to be taken to the killing chambers; in order to prepare, the ESMA would properly feed and take care of the victims to bulk them up. This was in a concerted effort to make the eventual corpses seem more healthy and less connected to the operations of the ESMA.

=====Susana Reyes=====
Susana Reyes recalled that when it came time to shower, the bathrooms had no doors, which the guards took advantage of to objectify the women. The guard would yell obscenities and make sexually explicit comments to the women while they were showering. Leading Susana Reyes to decide to always shower fully dressed. One day Susana Reyes defied an authority after a nasty remark about her body which led to her being tied up and brutally beaten with a baton. Susana Reyes was an expecting mother in the ESMA and was gifted a hood for her unborn child. The hood was meant to be used for psychological torture since the tiny hood was meant to symbolize the &quot;capucha&quot; and seal the baby&#x27;s fate to a life of torture and suffering alongside her mother. On the contrary, there was a guard who could take good care of Susana Reyes especially when she became ill. However, that same guard would taunt Susana Reyes by saying &quot;take care of him&quot; insinuating that he was going to take away her child in order to raise it as his own. Fortunately, Susana Reyes escaped ESMA before giving birth to her child.

====Killing methods in the ESMA====
The ESMA, because it killed approximately 4,850 prisoners, used a plethora of methods to kill their victims. Many popular techniques did not require that the prisoners left the confines of the ESMA. Inside the basement, interrogation methods such as drowning and electrocuting were common and an easy way to kill. The ESMA officers, in other manners, found more unique ways to commit human rights violations that led to the deaths of many. For example, as seen in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, these officers would attempt scientific experiments to show how well the human body could handle the loss of limbs, the removal of organs, and the fluctuation of hot and cold temperatures. Victims were also taken outside of the ESMA in the custody of those in charge to promote a sense of entertainment on the way to their murders. They would leave the prisoners in the middle of the jungle, supervising them as they unsuccessfully attempted to escape. Eventually, the guards would shoot them until they were dead.

The most cited killing method in the ESMA includes pushing the prisoners off moving planes. Officers would require the ESMA residents to take rides in these planes, only to push them off and watch them fall to their deaths. The victims were often still conscious, despite having been drugged. As a result, numerous bodies of victims washed up on beaches hundreds of kilometers south of Buenos Aires. Also known as death flights, this inhumane treatment contributed in a major way to the numerous deaths that came from this detention center. A portion of the Argentines that were kidnapped by the military did not even make it to the ESMA. Argentines would resist or try to evade their capture forcing the military to wound them in order to take them in. Those that did not survive the trip to the ESMA or could not be saved by the navy doctors, the bodies would be cremated and buried in the athletic field. Overall, the ESMA committed approximately one-sixth of the total murders during the eight-year period of the Dirty War.

===Treatment of women in the ESMA===
Women were subject to psychological torture and sexual abuse while being captive in ESMA. Part of the military&#x27;s psychological torment and disciplining of women was to force them to adhere to beauty standards by giving them make-up, perfume, and wax. For later to be taken on fictional dates where they were later sexually assaulted by their &quot;date&quot; who in reality was a member of the military. ESMA was a place of constant sexual violence where not even pregnancy would spare women from being raped. Additionally, women who were pregnant were forced to give birth or abort their child in an unsafe and horrible medical environment. Children of the women who were forced to give birth were taken away and/or adopted by members of the military. It was common for women to return to ESMA after giving birth without even having the knowledge of what was the sex of their child or its whereabouts. Unlike men, during torture women were being sexually degraded and called slurs like &quot;turra&quot; which is Argentinian slang for whore.

====Trials====
A major trial, nicknamed &quot;the ESMA mega-trial&quot;, of 63 people accused of crimes against humanity (&quot;lesa humanidad&quot;) during the 1976-1983 dictatorship, including those involved in death flights, was reaching its close in July 2015. 830 witnesses and 789 victims were heard. There had been two previous trials after the Supreme Court struck down an amnesty the military dictatorship had granted its members; in the first the one accused committed suicide before a verdict was reached; in a 2009 trial, twelve defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial was still in progress , and was being covered in a dedicated blog, &quot;Causa ESMA&quot;, with links to video reports of significant court sentences and similar events; many items are selected from the Argentine &quot;Infojus Noticias&quot; (National Agency of judicial news) Web site, Nacionales section.

Gonzalo &quot;Chispa&quot; Sánchez was extradited to Argentina and faced charges, as of 2020.

A federal court sentenced eight sailors and police officers and a civilian in the trial of crimes against humanity perpetrated during the military dictatorship at the ESMA on February 19, 2021. Among those convicted are former Navy officer Carlos Castellvi, police officer Raúl Cabral, and civilian Miguel Conde.

====Military testimonies====
Members of the military claim that they were simply obeying orders. It was also claimed that military members were made to believe they were fighting a war against enemies in civilian clothes. Military members never protested their orders despite being aware of the tortures and gruesome acts occurring in the ESMA because they were persuaded to believe that it was a supreme act that needed to be done for the sake of Argentina.

==Memorial Museum &quot;Espacio Memoria y Derechos Humanos&quot; (Former ESMA)==

Since 2004 the original ESMA building has been used as a memorial museum to honor the memory of the disappeared. However, the mission of the memorial museum goes beyond that. ESMA will serve as a warning to assure that the gruesome acts of torture and other crimes done by the dictatorship will never occur ever again. Argentines feel obligated to use the museum to share the stories of those that lost their lives during the Dirty War and to show the horrors that occurred within the walls of ESMA.

<text>Nicholas Keynes Humphrey (born 27 March 1943) is an English neuropsychologist based in Cambridge, known for his work on the evolution of primate intelligence and consciousness. He studied mountain gorillas with Dian Fossey in Rwanda; he was the first to demonstrate the existence of &quot;blindsight&quot; after brain damage in monkeys; he proposed the theory of the &quot;social function of intellect&quot;. He is the only scientist to have edited the literary journal &quot;Granta&quot;.

Humphrey played a significant role in the anti-nuclear movement in the late 1970s and delivered the BBC Bronowski memorial lecture titled &quot;Four Minutes to Midnight&quot; in 1981. 
His 10 books include &quot;Consciousness Regained&quot;, &quot;The Inner Eye&quot;, &quot;A History of the Mind&quot;, &quot;Leaps of Faith&quot;, &quot;The Mind Made Flesh&quot;, &quot;Seeing Red&quot;, &quot;Soul Dust&quot;, and &quot;Sentience&quot;. He has received several honours, including the Martin Luther King Memorial Prize, the Pufendorf Medal and the Mind and Brain Prize. 
He has been lecturer in psychology at Oxford, assistant director of the Subdepartment of Animal Behaviour at Cambridge, professor of psychology at the New School for Social Research, New York, and school professor at the London School of Economics.

==Family==

Humphrey is the son of the immunologist John H. Humphrey and the psychoanalyst Janet Humphrey (née Hill). His maternal grandparents were the Nobel Prize–winning physiologist Archibald Hill and the social reformer Margaret Hill. His great uncle was the economist John Maynard Keynes. His paternal grandfather was the inventor H. A. Humphrey, and his great aunt the pioneering chemist Edith Humphrey. Humphrey married Caroline Waddington, daughter of C. H. Waddington, in 1967 (divorced 1977). In 1994 he married Ayla Kohn, with whom he has two children.

==Early career==

Nicholas Humphrey was educated at Westminster School (1956–61) and Trinity College, Cambridge (1961–67).

His doctoral research at Cambridge, supervised by Lawrence Weiskrantz, was on the neuropsychology of vision in primates. He made the first single cell recordings from the superior colliculus of monkeys, and discovered the existence of a previously unsuspected capacity for vision after total lesions of the striate cortex. This capacity was later confirmed in human beings and is now called &quot;blindsight&quot;.

On moving to Oxford, he turned his attention to evolutionary aesthetics. He did research on monkey visual preferences (especially colour preferences) and wrote the essay &quot;The Illusion of beauty&quot;, which, as a radio broadcast, won the Glaxo Science Writers Prize in 1980.

==Work in evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind==

He returned to Cambridge, to the Sub Department of Animal Behaviour in 1970, and there met Dian Fossey, who invited him to spend three months at her gorilla study camp in Rwanda. His experience with the gorillas, and a subsequent visit to Richard Leakey&#x27;s field-site on Lake Turkana, set Humphrey thinking about how cognitive skills – intelligence and consciousness – could have arisen as an adaption to social life. In 1976 he wrote an essay titled &quot;The Social Function of Intellect&quot;, which is widely regarded as one of the foundational works of evolutionary psychology and the basis for Machiavellian intelligence theory. This paper formed the basis of his first book, &quot;Consciousness Regained: Chapters in the Development of Mind&quot; (1983).

In 1984 Humphrey left his academic post at Cambridge to work on his Channel 4 television series &quot;The Inner Eye&quot;, on the development of the human mind. This series was finished in 1986 with the release of a book of the same name.

In 1987, Daniel Dennett invited Humphrey to work with him at his Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. They worked on developing an empirically based theory of consciousness, and undertook a study on Multiple Personality Disorder.

Humphrey&#x27;s next book, &quot;A History of the Mind&quot; (1992), put forward a theory on how consciousness as feeling rather than thinking may have evolved. This book won the inaugural British Psychological Society&#x27;s annual Book of the Year Award in 1993.

His writings on consciousness continued in &quot;The Mind Made Flesh: Essays from the Frontiers of Evolution and Psychology&quot; (2002), &quot;Seeing Red: A Study in Consciousness&quot; (2006), and &quot;Soul Dust: the Magic of Consciousness&quot; (2011), and most recently &quot;Sentience&quot; .

==Other work==

Humphrey became active in the anti-nuclear movement in the late 1970s. This led to an invitation to deliver the Bronowski lecture on the BBC in 1981. He titled his lecture, on the dangers of the arms race, &quot;Four Minutes to Midnight&quot;. With Robert Lifton he edited an anthology of writings on war and peace, &quot;In a Dark Time&quot;, which was released in 1984 and was awarded the Martin Luther King Memorial Prize.

In 1992, Humphrey was appointed to a Senior Research Fellowship at Darwin College, Cambridge funded by the Perrott-Warwick Fellowship in parapsychology. He undertook a sceptical study of parapsychological phenomena such as extra-sensory perception and psychokinesis, resulting in his book &quot;Soul Searching: Human Nature and Supernatural Belief&quot; (1995) (in America this book was published under the title &quot;Leaps of Faith&quot;).

Humphrey has worked on a number of TV and radio documentaries as well as &quot;The Inner Eye&quot;. The topics range from the psychology of paranormal belief to the psycho-history of mediaeval animal trials.

In 2005, he visited the Ulas family of human quadrupeds in southern Turkey and published a report on them with John Skoyles and Roger Keynes. A documentary entitled &quot;The Family That Walks on All Fours&quot; based on this visit was broadcast on BBC2 in March 2006, and on NOVA in November 2006.

Over the last ten years Humphrey has been investigating the placebo effect, and has put forward a novel theory with John Skoyles of what he calls the &quot;health management system&quot; through which the brain has top-down control over the body&#x27;s healing resources.

He has recently become an Advisor to the BMW Guggenheim Lab, and in 2016 he gave the annual Medawar Lecture at UCL.

Humphrey is an atheist and suggested the analogy of religion to viruses to Richard Dawkins.

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1672/12) with Nicholas Humphrey in 2016 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.

<text>Spanx, LLC is a United States shapewear company, founded by Sara Blakely in Atlanta, Georgia in 2000. The company offers innerwear and outerwear, including activewear, apparel, denim, shapewear, swimwear, intimates, leggings, and hosiery. As of 2021, the company was valued at $1.2 billion and its products are sold in over 50 countries.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
Sara Blakely created Spanx in 2000 as a solution to the discomfort she experienced wearing pantyhose in hot weather and disliking the seamed foot that stuck out of an open-toe shoe. After graduating from Florida State University (FSU) in 1993, Blakely first worked at Walt Disney World Resort, followed by Danka, an office supply company, where she sold fax machines door to door. She cut the feet off her control-top pantyhose to achieve a “smooth look” under white pants but did not like that the pantyhose rolled up her leg. Blakely moved to Atlanta, where she continued working for Danka from 9-5, set aside her $5000 in savings, and spent two years creating her product. Blakely explained that she chose the name “Spanks” because of the “k” sound in the internationally recognized “Coca-Cola” and “Kodak.” She changed the spelling to “Spanx” at the last minute after reading that made-up names sold better. After several hosiery factories turned down her product, Blakely brought her idea to Neiman Marcus, where she convinced the buying rep by modeling her white pants with and without Spanx. She then brought the product to Bloomingdale’s, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman.
Once the Spanx brand was created, Blakely sent several of her products to The Oprah Winfrey Show. In November 2000, the brand was featured in Oprah&#x27;s Favorite Things. In 2001, Blakely arranged with QVC to feature her product. In 2011, Spanx reported revenue of just under $250 million, and Forbes rated Blakely as the youngest self-made female billionaire. Spanx opened its first brick and mortar store in 2012. In 2013, Jessica Alba, Adele and Jennifer Garner wore Spanx to the Oscars. Gwyneth Paltrow also wears the brand.
In 2021, the asset manager firm Blackstone bought a majority stake in Spanx, valuing the company at $1.2 billion. An all-female investment team from Blackstone prepared the deal, and it was announced that the Board of Directors would be all-female, with Blakely serving as executive chairman. At the same time, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Whitney Wolfe Herd also invested in Spanx.

=== Launch ===
In 2000, Blakely launched the Spanx brand from her apartment, undertaking all initial calls and marketing herself. Her boyfriend at the time, a healthcare consultant, later resigned from his job and joined Blakely in the running of the nascent business.

Blakely previously conducted a meeting with a representative of the Neiman Marcus Group, at which she changed into the product in the ladies restroom in the presence of the Neiman Marcus buyer to prove the benefits of her innovation. Blakely&#x27;s product was sold in seven Neiman Marcus stores as a result of the meeting; Bloomingdales, Saks, and Bergdorf Goodman soon followed.

===2000 onwards===
Following the establishment of the company, Blakely&#x27;s then-boyfriend eventually became Spanx&#x27;s chief operating officer (COO) and met Laurie Ann Goldman at the Saks Fifth Avenue in Atlanta in 2001, while she was on maternity leave from her employer at the time, Coca-Cola. Goldman was specifically looking for a Spanx product, and the pair exchanged contact details—Goldman became the CEO of Spanx in 2002.

Writing for &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in February 2014, Colleen Leahey identified Goldman as a key aspect of the company&#x27;s successful growth:
Goldman crafted a business model for the company based on lessons she learned during her 10-year stint at Coke: thinking big, starting small, and scaling fast. She advised her team at SPANX to focus on product quality over profit margins. “Every time somebody puts on a SPANX product, one of two things can happen: Our brand can get stronger, or our brand can get weaker. We gain leverage or we lose leverage.”

In the first half of 2014, Blakely worked on building the company&#x27;s first standalone retail stores in shopping malls along the East Coast of the U.S., and also introduced denim to an expanding Spanx product line for the &quot;Fall&quot; range in March.

Goldman resigned from the company in February 2014, after over 10 years at the head of the Spanx. Gregg Ribatt, who had previously worked as an executive for Bennett Footwear, Stuart Weitzman Holdings and Collective Brands&#x27; Performance &amp; Lifestyle Group, was appointed as interim chief executive officer. Ribatt&#x27;s appointment generated discussions about a potential footwear expansion by Spanx according to a statement Blakely made in October 2013 explaining her ambition to design the world&#x27;s most comfortable high-heel shoe prior to retirement.

In Blakely&#x27;s June 2014 &quot;Forbes&quot; profile, the publication claims that the company generates &quot;over $250 million in annual revenues and net profit margins estimated at 20%&quot;, while Blakely is very strongly committed to maintaining the private status of Spanx. However, speculation arose about a possible IPO following Goldman&#x27;s resignation.

In July 2014, Jan Singer, formerly of Nike, joined Spanx as CEO.

It was announced on October 20, 2021, that Blakely had sold a majority stake in the business to Blackstone. The company was valued at $1.2 billion. The deal was prepared by an all-female investment team from Blackstone, and it was announced that the Board of Directors would be all-female, including Blakely as the Executive Chairwoman.

== Products ==
Spanx has a range of sizes, from XS-3X. The company has expanded from shapewear, intimates and hosiery to apparel, activewear, loungewear, and denim. Their core collections include SPANXshape Booty Boost, SPANX Air Essentials, SPANXsculpt Seamless Power, SPANXsculpt OnCore, and SPANXshape EveryWear SPANXsmooth PerfectFit.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Ownership ===
Spanx is a private company and has not released financial information. Forbes estimates its value at $540 million in 2021.

In 2002, Laurie Ann Goldman, formerly at Coca-Cola, was appointed CEO of Spanx. She stepped down in 2014 and was replaced by Jan Singer, Nike’s head of apparel. In 2024, Caroline (Cricket) Whitton was appointed as CEO and Jeanne Jackson as executive chair of the board.
To celebrate the company&#x27;s $1.2 billion deal with Blackstone, employees received two first-class plane tickets and $10,000 each.

<text>Gilbert Eric Cannan (25 June 1884 – 30 June 1955) was a British novelist and dramatist.

==Early life==

Born in Manchester of Scottish descent, he got on badly with his family, and in 1897 he was sent to live in Oxford with the economist Edwin Cannan. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge; he started on a legal career, but turned to writing in 1908, after a short spell as an actor.

==Career==

Cannan worked first as a translator, and a reviewer in London publications. Many of his novels are in part autobiographical, and fit into a novel sequence the &quot;Lawrie Saga&quot;, around the character Stephen Lawrie. Samuel Butler was a major influence on his fiction. In 1914, the novelist Henry James in an article in &quot;The Times&quot; named Cannan as one of four significant up-and-coming authors, alongside D. H. Lawrence, Compton Mackenzie and Hugh Walpole.

He was employed as a secretary by J. M. Barrie, working with him in their efforts against censorship of the theatre by the Lord Chamberlain. A relationship developed in 1909 between Cannan and Barrie&#x27;s wife Mary Ansell, a former actress who felt neglected in her marriage. Cannan had been wooing Kathleen Bruce, who at the same time was receiving advances from the explorer Robert Falcon Scott. When Bruce decided to marry Scott, Mary Barrie&#x27;s sympathy for Cannan developed a momentum of its own. Her husband sought to be reconciled, but relented and divorced her in a high-profile case, and she and Cannan were married in 1910. Cannan was caricatured as Mr. Gunn, a minor character in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s 1911 drama &quot;Fanny&#x27;s First Play&quot;.
During World War I he was a pacifist and then conscientious objector, and was involved in the National Council Against Conscription. He used his experiences in later novels, making the character Melian Stokes in &quot;Pugs and Peacocks&quot; a portrait of Bertrand Russell. He had known Ottoline Morrell from before the war. During it he moved in her circle, introducing her to D. H. Lawrence, and knew also Dora Carrington, Dorothy Brett and the artist Mark Gertler. Cannan&#x27;s book &quot;Mendel&quot; was based on Gertler&#x27;s early life (Mendel being his Yiddish given name), and explored his relationships with C. R. W. Nevinson and Carrington. Gertler painted &quot;Gilbert Cannan and his Mill&quot;; the picture is now in the Ashmolean Museum. The mill was at Cholesbury in Buckinghamshire, where Cannan was living in 1916, and which attracted a number of his intellectual circle (including Lawrence and his wife Frieda, and Katherine Mansfield and John Middleton Murry). The picture also shows the Cannans&#x27; two Newfoundland dogs, Sammy on the left and Luath, who was also Barrie&#x27;s dog before his divorce from Mary Ansell and the inspiration for Nana, the Darling children&#x27;s nurse in Peter Pan. In 1916, partly in response to the devastating effects of the war and the threat of conscription, Cannan suffered a mental breakdown, an experience which he vividly described in his book, &quot;The Release of the Soul&quot;.

His marriage ended in 1918 when he had an affair with Gwen Wilson who later married Henry Mond in 1920 while Cannan was lecturing in the United States. Unconventionally, Cannan lived with Wilson and her new husband in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; in their home, Mulberry House, in Smith Square, Westminster. A hint of their relationship is suggested in Cannan&#x27;s dedication of &quot;Letters from a Distance&quot; &quot;to Gwen, without whose courage, tenderness and force there would have been no author to write these letters.&quot;

After the war Cannan devoted himself to writing, translation work and travel but another mental breakdown in 1923 proved untreatable. He became a mental patient at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton. He then spent the rest of his life confined to Holloway Sanatorium near Virginia Water where he died of cancer on 30 June 1955.

==Family==
The poet May Wedderburn Cannan and her sister, the writer Joanna Cannan, were cousins of his, daughters of the academic Charles Cannan (Dean of Trinity College, Oxford, and Secretary to the Delegates of Oxford University Press); as was Professor Edwin Cannan, the noted LSE economist (and brother of Charles Cannan); Joanna&#x27;s daughter Diana Pullein-Thompson was his biographer. Joanna Cannan&#x27;s son, Denis Cannan was also a dramatist.

<doc id="1276168" wikidata="Q2152085" url="?curid=1276168" title="Southwest Ranches, Florida">
<text>Southwest Ranches is a town in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is a suburban community part of the Miami metropolitan area and is located on the eastern edge of the Everglades, southwest of Fort Lauderdale and about northwest of Miami. It is unusual in that it consists of three non-contiguous areas, albeit they are in close proximity; the two largest being separated by . It became the county&#x27;s 30th incorporated place in 2000 to avoid annexation into Pembroke Pines and to preserve its semirural lifestyle. Because the area has many horse ranches and is located in the southwestern part of Broward County, residents chose &quot;Southwest Ranches&quot; over other potential town names.

The population at the 2020 census was 7,607. The town includes the former census-designated places of Country Estates, Green Meadow, Ivanhoe Estates, Rolling Oaks, and Sunshine Ranches (as well as subneighborhoods Landmark Ranch Estates and Sterling Ranch Estates), all of which are now Southwest Ranches neighborhoods. To support its rural-equestrian lifestyle, the town has developed many equestrian trails.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, the Tequesta were the native people in the southeastern part of Florida for almost 2,000 years from 500 BCE to the 18th century CE when the Spanish conquered Florida. In the 1970s archeologist excavated a Tequesta burial site, with artifacts that go back to more than a thousand years, that was part of a former Everglades tree island. There is also an old Indian trading post in the town.

In 1996, Pembroke Pines proposed a bill to the Broward County Legislative Delegation to annex all the unincorporated areas between Griffin Road, Sheridan Street, Flamingo Road, and SR 25 into Pembroke Pines. Hundreds of citizens from the unincorporated area of Southwest Ranches packed the delegation hearing in November 1996 at Pembroke Pines City Hall to protest this takeover and to call for the right to form their own city. As a result of this grassroots effort, the State Legislature passed a bill in the 1997 session that called for a vote of Southwest Ranches&#x27; citizens in March 2000; they could be annexed into either Pembroke Pines or Davie, or become a new city.

Southwest Ranches Homeowners Association was an umbrella group composed of individual homeowners associations in the Southwest Ranches area. Anyone belonging to an individual homeowners association was also automatically a member of the group, with full voting rights. In 1997, its members agreed to actively promote incorporation of a new city for the area and formed a political committee to explore this option. A feasibility committee was appointed to determine if a new city would be viable. They would have to know if revenues would be adequate to cover the costs of running a city. Dr. Milan Dluhy of Florida International University was contacted and asked to complete a formal feasibility study; Dluhy had produced many such studies for groups that subsequently became successful cities. The committee also contacted Moyer and Associates, the company that provides contract services to Weston.

The feasibility committee determined that a contract city would be the best option. Contracting would allow the city access to experienced professionals without having to hire these individuals on a full-time basis. This would save taxpayers money and avoid many costly capital expenses. Moyer and Associates provided the feasibility committee and Dr. Dluhy with financial information on which to base estimates of both income and expenses. The committee also considered the figures provided by the PMG study. PMG is the company hired by Broward County to conduct a study comparing the costs of Pembroke Pines and Davie to the costs of being incorporated into a new city.

On July 3, 1999, the Southwest Ranches Homeowners Association sponsored a parade and picnic to declare the area&#x27;s independence. Speakers at the event included then-Senator Howard Forman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, County Commissioner Lori Parrish, Sheriff Ken Jenne, and Weston Mayor Harry Rosen. The bill passed in 1997 authorized the vote in 2000 to determine if residents wanted to form their own city. If the vote was for a new city, a charter was to be drawn up and an election forming the city held in 2001. Leaders realized, however, that if a charter could be drawn up sooner, it could be approved in 2000 and the city formed a year earlier, which would be financially beneficial to the residents.

A charter committee was formed to draw up a charter. The committee met almost weekly during July and August 1999, and formulated a new charter, using the Weston charter as a template. A contest was held to name the town, with 122 different names submitted. A vote was held on October 12, 1999, to select one of the top five names, which Southwest Ranches won. Southwest Ranches Homeowners Association members voted to move forward and request a local bill to allow incorporation in 2000 instead of 2001, which was approved. On March 14, 2000, residents voted overwhelmingly to form a new town rather than be annexed.

The most contentious issue during charter committee meetings was whether or not to have districts. The majority of members felt that council members should be elected at large, meaning that any qualified candidate could run for a seat, no matter where that individual lived, but some felt that candidates should only be able to run if they lived in one of four districts. When the election to approve the charter was held on June 6, 2000, the issue was put to a vote, and the majority of voters selected districts. Council members were elected on July 25, 2000, and the town was officially established.

The area is primarily residential, with most lots consisting of or more. Some are small farms and equestrian ranches. The town has laws that keep homes from being built on lots less than an acre. To conserve the town&#x27;s rural lifestyle, the laws also generally prevent streetlights and sidewalks from being constructed.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 7,607 people, 2,024 households, and 1,730 families residing in the town.

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 United States census, there were 7,345 people, 2,210 households, and 1,844 families residing in the town.
===2000 census===
As of 2000, before being annexed to Southwest Ranches, those who spoke only English accounted for 82.09% of Green Meadow residents, while those who spoke Spanish at home made up 17.90% of the population. In the Rolling Oaks neighborhood, those who spoke only English accounted for 70.42% of all residents, while Spanish speakers were 29.57% of the population. In the Country Estates neighborhood, English-only speakers were 78.46% of the population while Spanish speakers made up 21.53% of the population. In the Sunshine Ranches neighborhood, 76.22% of residents spoke only English while 22.16% spoke Spanish 1.61% spoke Italian.

==Economy==
The Florida Department of Corrections operates the Region IV Correctional Facility Office on the grounds of Broward Correctional Institution in the former Country Estates CDP and in Southwest Ranches. The Broward prison formerly housed the female death row, which was moved to the Lowell Correctional Institution in February 2003.

==Parks and recreation==
To support its rural-equestrian lifestyle, the town has developed miles of multiuse trails. People can be often be seen riding horses or bicycles or walking the trails that spread throughout the town. Since incorporation, the town has also acquired seven open-space parks, only one of which has been developed so far. This park includes a schooling ring, a show ring, and the Equestrian Oasis, an art installation primarily used to provide drinking water for horses.

==Government==
From the time of its founding until 2012, the town conducted its business from a modular office at the South Broward Drainage District headquarters. In 2012, the town, under the leadership of Vice Mayor Doug McKay, renovated a former church to create Southwest Ranches&#x27; first permanent town hall. Police and emergency services are provided by the nearby town of Davie.

Southwest Ranches&#x27; charter defines the governing body as a council with one mayor and four council members. The mayor and the council members are elected at large from the electorate of the town, but the council members represent districts in which they must reside. The mayoral role is largely ceremonial with no more power than any council member. Other charter positions serving Southwest Ranches include the town administrator, financial administrator, and town clerk.

The town&#x27;s first council consisted of Mayor Mecca Fink, Vice Mayor Johnny Dollar, Forrest Blanton, Freddy Fisikelli, and Astor Knight.

<doc id="1276169" wikidata="Q3351875" url="?curid=1276169" title="Dashakumaracharita">
<text>Dashakumaracharita (&quot;The narrative of ten young men&quot;, IAST: &quot;Daśa-kumāra-Carita&quot;, Devanagari: दशकुमारचरित) is a prose romance in Sanskrit, attributed to Dandin (दण्डी), believed to have flourished in the seventh to eighth centuries CE. However, there is some obscurity surrounding its textual tradition, the identity of the author and the date of composition.

It describes the adventures of ten young men, the &quot;Kumaras&quot;, all of whom are either princes or sons of royal ministers, as narrated by the men themselves (however, there are irregularities in the text). These narratives are replete with accounts of demigods, ghosts, prostitutes, gamblers, intrigues with voluptuous women, astonishing coincidences, cockfights, anthropophagy, sorcery, robberies, murders and wars. The reader is treated to some very striking passages; for instance, a seductive young girl (all of whose anatomical features are very frankly described) deftly prepares a fragrant meal of rice-gruel and vegetables for her prospective suitor in the sixth chapter of the &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot;.

The seventh chapter of the &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; contains a specimen of lipogrammatic writing (a species of constrained writing). At the beginning of the chapter, Mantragupta is called upon to relate his adventures. However, during the previous night of vigorous lovemaking, his lips have been nibbled several times by his beloved; as a result, they are now swollen, making it painful for him to close them. Thus, throughout his narrative, he is compelled to refrain from using any labial consonants (प,फ,ब,भ,म).

== The text ==
Most extant texts of &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; are composed of 
# &quot;Pūrvapīthikā&quot; (पूर्वपीठिका, Prologue) divided into 5 chapters (&quot;Ucchvāsa&quot;, उच्छ्वास);
# The &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; proper, divided into 8 chapters;
# The &quot;Uttarapīthikā&quot; (उत्तरपीठिका, Epilogue), without any subdivisions.

Some text at the beginning and the end of &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; proper has been lost; thus it contains only eight of the ten narratives, and furthermore, the stories of Rajavahan and Vishruta are incomplete. The 1st and the 3rd parts seem to have been added later by various authors (some of whom have tried to mimic the style of the original); indeed, there are several disparate versions for these parts in existence.

The plot, as described below, almost makes a coherent whole. However, as mentioned above, it comes from the hands of multiple authors writing in possibly different centuries. There are small discrepancies between the three parts; e.g., the patronage of Pramati as described in the prologue disagrees with the one in &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; proper.

=== The Kumaras ===

The ten Kumaras are named in the first chapter of the prologue as follows:
# Rājavāhana (राजवाहन)
# Sōmadatta (सोमदत्त)
# Pushpōdbhava (पुष्पोद्भव)
# Apahāravarmana (अपहारवर्मन)
# Upahāravarmana (उपहारवर्मन)
# Arthapāla (अर्थपाल)
# Pramati (प्रमति)
# Mitragupta (मित्रगुप्त)
# Mantragupta (मंत्रगुप्त)
# Vishruta (विश्रुत).

=== Prologue ===

The first two chapters of the prologue form the frame story.

==== I ====

King Rajahamsa of Magadha is defeated in a war by the rival King Manasara of Malwa, and thence retires into the Vindhya forest together with his ministers. During his sojourn, he and his ministers respectively sire sons. Several other young men are brought to his dwelling due to various incidents (e.g., one is rescued from a river, another from a tiger, and still another wanders off from a battlefield during a skirmish). These altogether make the ten &quot;Kumaras&quot;. The men are schooled in several disciplines such as law, grammar, astrology, music, medicine and warfare.

==== II ====
The men are dispatched together by the King for a Digvijaya (world conquest). Prince Rajavahana comes across a &quot;Matanga&quot; Brahmana. The latter lures him into a scheme to conquer Patala (the netherworld), and the two disappear into the earth through a chasm. After the scheme is accomplished (and the Brahmana marries the daughter of the King of Asuras), Rajavahana returns to earth, only to find that his friends have all scattered away. Eventually, the young men will meet again and relate their adventures, which will form the body of the present work.

Rajavahana travels to Ujjain, where he meets Somadatta. The latter begins his narrative.

==== III ====

Somadatta had gone to Ujjain in search of the lost Prince, where King Mattakala has usurped King Viraketu. Somadatta finds a jewel near a river, and then gives it to a destitute Brahmana in charity. The latter has him imprisoned as a jewel thief. Somadatta discovers that his fellow prisoners are loyal to the minister of King Viraketu. They break free from the prison, raise an army and overthrow the usurper. The old king is restored to the throne and Somadatta marries his daughter. At the end of this narrative, Rajavahana and Somadatta accidentally meet Pushpodbhava and ask him to relate his adventures. The latter begins his narrative.

==== IV ====

Pushpodbhava saves a man falling from a cliff, who turns out to be his father, who had tried to commit suicide after becoming despondent for having lost his family. Shortly afterwards, he saves a woman from throwing herself in fire due to grief; this turns out to be his mother. Later Pushpodbhava acquires vast wealth by applying magical collyrium to his eyes to detect subterranean riches. He becomes enamoured of the beautiful damsel Balachandrika, who is facing unwelcome advances from a certain Daruvarma. Pushpodbhava spreads a report that Balachandrika is possessed by a Yaksha. He accompanies Balachandrika to Daruvarma&#x27;s apartment disguised as her female attendant, kills him when he tries to sport with her, and blames the death on the Yaksha. He then marries Balachandrika.

==== V ====

Rajavahana relates his adventures. He had gone to the town of Avanti where he became enamoured of Princess Avantisundari (the daughter of Manasara, his father&#x27;s enemy). Meanwhile, Manasara has temporarily abdicated his kingdom to practice penance and left Chandavarman in charge. Rajavahana and Avantisundari are married by a friendly conjurer who makes Chandavarman believe that the wedding ceremony is a delusion. The couple retires into a private chamber for amorous sport.

=== The &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; proper ===

In Chapter I, the text begins in the middle of Rajavahana&#x27;s story.

==== I ====

The lovers are discovered by royal attendants and reported to Chandavarman, who becomes furious, arrests Rajavahana and imprisons him in a wooden cage. Then Chandavarman launches a military campaign against his rival King Simhavarman (carrying along the wooden cage onto the battlefield) and vanquishes him. Meanwhile, a message arrives from Manasara commanding that Rajavahana be executed. As he is about to be trampled to death by an elephant, the chain tied to his feet falls off and is revealed to be a nymph who had previously been cursed into assuming that form. Meanwhile, Chandavarman is killed by a thief. Several military allies of Simhavarman arrive at the scene, amongst whom all of Rajavahana&#x27;s remaining missing friends are found. Now Apaharavarman is asked to relate his adventures.

==== II ====

Apaharavarman travelled to the city of Champa, where he became a gamester and a burglar and helped the maiden Kulapalika to gain her lover by enriching her with burgled wealth. A devious prostitute named Kamanamanjari had defrauded several people in that city. Apaharavarman falls in love with her sister Ragamanjari, tricks Kamanamanjari into giving back her money to her former paramours, and marries the sister. Later he rashly attacks a soldier and is imprisoned. The jailor Kantaka uses his services to dig a tunnel out of the prison into the royal palace since Karnataka is enamoured of the princess and wishes to visit her in secret. However, Apaharavarman kills the jailor and escapes through the tunnel.

==== III ====

Next, Upaharavarman relates his adventures. He had returned to his own country Videha in search of the Prince. He meets his old nurse who informs him that his father&#x27;s kingdom has been usurped by King Vikatavarman. He entices the king into a trap to perform a magical rite in order to exchange his (the King&#x27;s) old and shrivelled body for a new one and succeeds in killing him. The kingdom is restored to his father.

Arthapala narrates his adventures. He had gone to Kashi where he heard the plight of Kampala (his father, and a former royal minister). The latter was sentenced to death by the evil King Simhaghosha. While Kampala is being led to his execution, Arthapala drops a poisonous snake on his body and makes him fall down senseless. The seemingly dead body is carried away and later restored to life by Arthapala (who knows anti-poison charms). Later Arthapala overthrows Simhaghosha and marries the princess Manikarnika.

==== V ====

Pramati relates his adventures. While travelling through the Vindhya mountains, he fell asleep under a tree. During the night he was transported by a nymph to the palace of the princess Navamalika, with whom he fell in love. In order to gain the princess, he hatches a plan in consort with a Brahmana (whom he has met at a cock-fight). The Brahmana dresses Pramati in female garb, and leaves &#x27;her&#x27; in the protection of the King (Navamalika&#x27;s father) telling the King that &#x27;she&#x27; is the Brahmana&#x27;s daughter. While in the palace, Pramati wins the princess&#x27;s affection, but then absconds and joins the Brahmana. The two approach the King, and the Brahmana presents Pramati as his prospective son-in-law who has come to claim his future wife. The King is, of course, unable to produce her, and is forced to give up his own daughter in order to propitiate the Brahmana (who otherwise threatens to immolate himself). Thus Pramati is wedded to Navamalika.

==== VI ====

Mitragupta relates his adventures. He had travelled to the Suhma country, where, by the grace of the goddess Durga, the king had obtained two children, a son (Bhimadhanva) and a daughter (Kandukavati). The goddess had stipulated that the son should be subordinate to the daughter&#x27;s husband. The princess chooses Mitragupta as her husband in a public festival. This infuriates Bhimadhanva (who resents being subordinated to a stranger) and he throws Mitragupta into the sea. He is rescued by a passing vessel of Yavanas who want to hold him as a slave. However, at the same time, their ship is attacked by Bhimadhanva&#x27;s party. Mitragupta helps the Yavanas in repelling the attack and wins their favour. The ship drifts off to an island and Mitragupta lands on the shore. There he meets a Rakshasa who threatens to eat him unless he answers the following four questions: 1. What is cruel by nature? 2. What ensures the happiness of a householder? 3. What is love? and 4. What is the best means of achieving difficult things? He answers 1. The heart of a woman, 2. The virtues of a wife, 3. Imagination and 4. Ability. He illustrates his answers by four stories (told in full in the text). The Rakshasa is appeased by these answers. Just then, another Rakshasa is seen forcibly carrying the princess Kandukavati through the air. She is rescued and then married to Mitragupta.

==== VII ====

Mantragupta relates his adventures, in a speech which is entire &quot;niroshthya&quot; (निरोष्ठ्य, i.e., without labial consonants). One night he sees that a Siddha (sorcerer) is about to sacrifice the princess Kanakalekha of Kalinga in order to obtain miraculous powers. He kills the sorcerer and rescues the princess who falls in love with him. The sorcerer&#x27;s slave (a ghost) is overjoyed to be freed from his master and clandestinely carries Mantragupta into the palace, where he lives with the princess in the ladies chambers. One day, as the king of Kalinga (and the princess), is away on a hunting expedition, their entire retinue is surprised and made captive by the rival king Jayasimha. The latter wishes to possess the princess, who resists his advances. In order to rescue her, Mantragupta dresses in the rags and severed hair of the sorcerer and presents himself as an ascetic possessing magical powers. He convinces Jayasimha to bathe in a presumably enchanted lake which would frighten away the Yaksha who has presumably possessed the princess. Mantragupta hides himself in a cavity along the bank of the lake and drowns Jayasimha when the latter enters. He issues forth as the King (who has acquired a new lustrous body), frees the old king and marries the princess.

==== VIII ====

Vishruta begins to relate his adventures. While wandering through the Vindhya forest, he comes across a young boy accompanied by an old servant. The boy is the prince of Vidarbha whose kingdom has been usurped. This had forced the queen Vasundhara to take refuge (with her son and daughter) with Mitravarma, who proved to be a treacherous ally. Thus the queen is compelled to send away the boy to safety. Vishruta takes upon himself to help the boy. He sends back the servant and instructs him to spread a false report that the young prince is dead. He also sends a poisonous garland to the queen which she uses to kill Mitravarma. Then Vishruta arrives in the city with the young boy, restores the kingdom and meets the queen in a temple of Durga. The boy is restored to his rightful throne, and Vishruta marries the princess.

The text breaks off in the middle of Vishruta&#x27;s story.

=== Epilogue ===

Later Vishruta restores the kingdom of Vidarbha to King Bhaskarvarman by leading an expedition against the usurper Vasantabhanu.

After the narratives have ended, a messenger arrives from the old King Rajahamsa (father of Prince Rajavahana). The King had been very mournful when the &quot;Kumaras&quot; had scattered away, but was comforted by a seer who assured him that they would return after sixteen years. This interval has now come to pass. The &quot;Kumaras&quot; return with an army to Ujjain, and succeed in defeating King Manasara. Various kingdoms are distributed to the &quot;Kumaras&quot;, which they govern with justice and happiness to all.

== Authorship and relationship with the &quot;Avantisundarī&quot; ==

There has been extensive debate about the authorship of the &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot;. The author is traditionally regarded as the poet and grammarian Daṇḍin who composed the &quot;Kavyadarsha&quot;, a manual on poetry and rhetoric, and according to Yigal Bronner, &#x27;there is now a wide consensus that a single Daṇḍin authored all these works at the Pallava court in Kāñcī around the end of the seventh century&#x27;.

In the early twentieth century, Agashe doubted this attribution on the grounds that the two works differ very widely in style and tone. Since a poet &quot;Dandin&quot; (presumably distinct from a prose writer) is also mentioned in sundry ancient Indian texts, he is led to conjecture the existence of at least three distinct &quot;Dandin&quot;s. Since &quot;Dandin&quot; (literally, a staff-bearer) is also a common adjective for ascetics or religious mendicants, Wilson doubted whether it was the author&#x27;s proper name at all.

On the other hand, in the mid twentieth century Kale accepted that &quot;Kavyadarsha&quot; and &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; had been written by the same person. On the basis of textual evidence from the &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot;, he opines that the author must have lived earlier than the Muslim invasion of India, i.e., before the 11th century. Moreover, since the &quot;Kavyadarsha&quot; refers to the Prakrit poem Setubandha (सेतुबंध) composed in the 5th century, he is led to 6th-8th century as the most probable time of composition. (This remains in some tension with the fact that &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; is not referred to by any other text until the 10th century. There is also a conflicting tradition, generally considered unreliable, which makes &quot;Dandin&quot; a contemporary of Kalidasa.)

=== Relationship with the &quot;Avantisundarī&quot; ===

Another work attributed to Daṇḍin is the &quot;Avantisundarī&quot; or &quot;Avantisundarīkathā&quot; (The Story of the Beautiful Lady from Avanti). Like the &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; this is in prose, but is even more fragmentarily preserved: the two surviving manuscripts break off early in the text. A later Sanskrit poem, the &quot;Avantisundarīkathāsāra&quot; (Gist of the Story of the Beautiful Lady from Avanti) seems to have summarised the full story, and its surviving portion covers more of the story, and more again is preserved in a thirteenth-century Telugu translation. These texts overlap significantly with the stories in the &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot;. Precisely how the &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; and the &quot;Avantisundarī&quot; originally related is unclear. Although many have argued that the two must have been composed by different people, the &quot;Avantisundarī&quot; too is &#x27;unmistakably ascribed to Daṇḍin by its colophons and by later sources&#x27;.

Several eminent scholars now believe on stylistic and other grounds that, as suggested by the verse summary and its Telugu translation, both the &quot;Avantisundarī&quot; and
the &quot;Daśakumāracarita&quot; originally formed a single massive prose work that was broken up at a relatively early age in its transmission; another view is that the two represent separate stages in the life and work of the same author.

== Editions and commentaries ==

The first translation, into Telugu, was produced by Ketana in c. 1250. Editions of the original Sanskrit text have been published in modern times by Agashe, Godbole and Parab, Kale, and Wilson. The work has been translated into English by Haksar, Jacob, Kale, Onians, and Ryder. In particular, the edition by Kale includes the original in Sanskrit, a literal English translation, as well as an extensive commentary on the stylistic and historical aspects of the text. In her translation of the lipogrammatic chapter, Onians omits the labial roman letters &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;m&#x27; and &#x27;p&#x27;. (E.g., she uses the circumlocution &#x27;honey-creator&#x27; instead of &#x27;bumblebee&#x27;). There is also a translation into German by Mayer.

Critical commentaries on the text have been written by, &quot;inter alia&quot;, Ghanashyama, Gupta and Pankaj. A more extensive bibliography may be found in Onians.

== Historical research ==

The &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; has been used to examine the creation of the Ajanta Caves, interpreting it as an extended metaphoric telling of the 5th-century fall of the Vākāṭaka dynasty, and a comparison to the 7th-century Pallava dynasty, which is the period that the work is conventionally dated to. Spink argues that the work has an essentially historical core, almost readable as a roman a clef, which is an accurate account of the Vākāṭaka fall and that Dandin (or one of the Dandins) had a personal, perhaps familial, connection to the events in the 5th-century. Evidence from the text has also been used to establish the spread of the worship of Vindhyavasini in the period.

== Criticism and analysis ==

The &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; has been compared to the Spanish genre of picaresque, linking the settings and drawing parallels 6th-century disorder of India to the disorder of Spain in the late mediaeval period. It has also been noted that the &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot;, while fantastic, has realism that is not present in contemporary prestigious works, and involves thieves, prostitutes and other less exalted members of society. Dandin may have borrowed major themes from the &quot;Brihatkatha&quot;. It has been said to focus on &quot;how people are, rather than how they should be&quot;.

<text>The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) is the primary law enforcement, investigative agency, and largest disciplined service under the Security Bureau of Hong Kong.

Pursuant to the one country, two systems principle, the HKPF is officially independent of the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Security of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which under usual circumstances may not interfere with Hong Kong’s local law enforcement matters. All HKPF officers are employed as civil servants and therefore required to pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Basic Law.

The HKPF consists of approximately 34,000 officers, including the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force, civil servants, and its Marine Region (3,000 officers and 143 vessels as of 2009).

==History==


A police force has been serving Hong Kong since shortly after the island was established as a colony in 1841. On 30 April 1841, 12 weeks after the British landed in Hong Kong, Captain Charles Elliot established a policing authority in the new colony, empowering Captain William Caine to enforce Qing law in respect of local inhabitants and &quot;British Police Law&quot; for &quot;non-natives&quot;. By October 1842, an organised police force (still under the direction of Caine who was also Chief Magistrate) was routinely bringing criminals before the courts for trial. Caine&#x27;s role as head of the police force ended when its first Superintendent was appointed on 22 February 1844, Captain Haly of the 41st Madras Native Infantry. The formal establishment of the force was gazetted on 1 May 1844.

During World War II, Japan occupied Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Police Force was temporarily disbanded. Policing duties were assumed by the Japanese Kempeitai, with Chinese officers being forced to serve alongside and officers of other ethnicities sent to Stanley Prison. Some local Chinese were also recruited as police officers, which the force retained after the liberation of Hong Kong from Japan and were given the letter designation of &quot;J&quot;. Officers served pre-war were also reinstated into the force.

The 1950s saw the commencement of Hong Kong&#x27;s 40-year rise to global prominence, during which time the Hong Kong Police tackled many issues that have challenged Hong Kong&#x27;s stability. Between 1949 and 1989, Hong Kong experienced several huge waves of immigration from mainland China, most notably 1958–62. In the 1970s and 1980s, large numbers of Vietnamese boat people arrived in Hong Kong, posing challenges first for marine police, secondly for officers who manned the dozens of camps in the territory and lastly for those who had to repatriate them. The force was granted the use of the title ‘royal’ in 1969 for its handling of the Hong Kong 1967 riots — renaming it the Royal Hong Kong Police Force.

In 1974, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) was created to give government wide-ranging powers to investigate corruption. At the turn of the 1980s, the Hong Kong Police Force began marketing itself as &quot;Asia&#x27;s Finest&quot;.

The recruitment of Europeans to the force ceased in 1994, and in 1995 the Royal Hong Kong Police took responsibility for patrolling the boundary with China. Prior to 1995, the British Army had operated the border patrol. The force played a prominent role in the process of the handover of sovereignty in 1997 and continues to perform ceremonial flag-raising on each anniversary. With the handover of sovereignty, the police force dropped the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; from its name.

In the 2010s, the police force played a prominent role in relation to the 2014 Hong Kong protests and 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Following Chris Tang&#x27;s appointment as the Commissioner of Police in November 2019, the police force changed its motto from &quot;We serve with pride and care&quot;, which had been used for more than 20 years, to &quot;Serving Hong Kong with honour, duty and loyalty.&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; suggested that this change would curry favour with the central government of China. In July 2022, as part of a process to remove colonial aspects from the force, foot drills changed from British style to Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army style with a goose step. The language spoken during drills changed from English to Chinese, and junior officers stopped addressing higher-ranking officers with &quot;Yes Sir&quot;.
===Controversies===
During the 1940s, the HKPF faced a number of corruption scandals involving officers. During the 1950s and 1960s, the force struggled with corruption issues relating to bribes from syndicated drugs and illegal gambling operations. Police corruption again emerged as a major concern in the early 1970s when the Commissioner ordered investigations to break the culture of corruption, causing forty-odd officers to flee Hong Kong with more than HK$80 million cash (about HK$2 million each).

More recently, the Hong Kong Police Force has faced extensive allegations of misconduct during the 2019 protests including excessive force, brutality, torture, and falsified evidence. In particular, the police were criticised for their failure to respond during the mob attack at the Yuen Long MTR station in July 2019. Several lawsuits were filed in October 2019 against the HKPF for failure to show identification during protests.

In May 2023, the HKPF recommended that schools install CCTV cameras in school classrooms to enhance security.

From 2019 to 2022, 24 to 42 police officers were arrested per year.
==Organisation and structure==

The Commissioner of Police serves as the commander of the HKPF and reports directly to the Secretary for Security. The HKPF is divided into six primary departments: Operations &amp; Support, Crime &amp; Security, Personnel &amp; Training, Management Services, Finance, Administration &amp; Planning, and National Security.
===Special Branch===

The Special Branch was established by the British Colonial Government of Hong Kong in 1934 originally as an anti-communist squad under MI5 with assistance from MI6. The branch later joined the Crime Department of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force in 1946 and focussed on preventing pro-KMT rightists and pro-CCP leftists from infiltrating the colony.
==Remuneration==
===Salaries and fringe benefits===
Police officers enjoy remuneration far exceeding median incomes in the Special Administrative Region (HK$18,000 per month in 2019), the base rate for newly recruited police constables with minimal high school education being HK$24,110 per month and that for high school matriculants being HK$42,655. In addition, all officers enjoy extensive housing benefits, free medical and dental benefits (including coverage of family members), with substantial vacation, sick and maternity leave allowances exceeding statutory minimums.

===Police welfare fund===
In addition, officers and their families enjoy substantial fringe benefits through the statutorily entrenched Police Welfare Fund which has current assets exceeding HK$200 million. Attracting funds in excess of HK$50 million per annum, almost entirely donations, the fund trustee, the Commissioner of Police, has unfettered freedom to choose how the funds are to be expended. The Commissioner disburses the bulk of its annual expenditure in the form of cash grants to police officers and their families.

A donation of HK$10 million by the pro-Beijing Friends of Hong Kong Association, which consists of National People’s Congress delegates and members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference national committee, in 2019, raised concern, as did a 2017 donation of HK$15 million, that fringe benefits may be inadequate.

===Addition fringe benefits===
Two trust funds established by statute in 1967 augment the benefits enjoyed by members of the force. The Police Children&#x27;s Education Trust and Police Education &amp; Welfare Trust disburse funds by way of scholarships, bursaries and grants for education expenses and to assist officers with needy children or in financial difficulty. These funds were also the recipients of HK$10 million in 2017 from an undisclosed donor.

==Police associations==
Numerous associations of serving and retired police officers have been formed over the years. Currently, these include:
* Superintendents&#x27; Association
* Hong Kong Police Inspectors&#x27; Association
* Overseas Inspectors&#x27; Association
* Junior Police Officers&#x27; Association
* Royal Hong Kong Police Association

The four serving officers&#x27; associations wield significant power, controlling half of the voting rights on the Police Force Council. Government consultations with Police Force staff are formally conducted through the council and the associations figure prominently at times of controversy.

==Ranks and insignia==
The HKPF continues to use ranks and insignia similar to those used in British police forces. Until 1997, the St Edward&#x27;s Crown was used in the insignia, when it was replaced with the Bauhinia flower crest of the Hong Kong government. Pips were modified with the Bauhinia flower in the middle replacing the insignia from the Order of the Bath. The crest of the force was modified in 1997. The rank structure, organisation and insignia are similar to those used by the Metropolitan Police Service until the mid-1970s.

Up until 1997, uniforms and hats had distinctions according to their rank. For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on the sleeve of the uniform. Special Duties Unit, Marine Police, and the Counter-terrorism Response Unit have their ranks at the back of the helmet or vest. Inspector to senior superintendent ranks have an insignia on the collar of the uniform. Chief Inspectors have a wide black stripe fitted on their police hats. Superintendents also have a small white stripe fitted on the police hat. Senior Superintendents and Chief Superintendents have a wide white stripe on their hats, Assistant and Senior Assistant Commissioners have 1 row of silver oak leaves on the edge of their hats while Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner has 2 rows of silver oak leaves, a slide with a silver vertical line on the collar of the uniform, a black baton, and a red whistle or a black and white whistle on the front right pocket.

==Uniforms and equipment==

===Current uniform===
The current Hong Kong Police uniform was implemented in 2005. Most front-line officers wear a light blue shirt and dark blue cargo trousers, while senior officers wear a white shirt.

A long-sleeved shirt is worn with a black necktie, while a short-sleeved shirt can be worn with an open collar in warm weather. A waist-length dark blue windbreaker can also be worn over the shirt in cooler temperatures.

Male officers typically wear a black peaked cap while female officers wear a black bowler hat with a red stripe. Dark-blue baseball caps may also be worn. Specialized unites wear either dark blue baseball caps or navy blue berets.

HKPF officers do not wear a badge, but instead carry a warrant card for identification. The uniform also does not include shoulder patches. Instead, a silver HKPF emblem is displayed on the headgear. The only patch on the uniform reads “Police” in English and Chinese, and is sewn above the left breast pocket of the shirt. Navy blue epaulettes worn on all uniform shirts and jackets show the officer&#x27;s rank insignia (if any) and unique identification number.

===Equipment===
Uniform officers wear a utility belt which holds a sidearm, extra ammunition, a handcuff, an extendable baton, a pepper spray, a Motorola radio with a connected remote speaker microphone attached to the shoulder and a body-mounted camera.

While the HKPF had been following their past equipment procurement policies for Hong Kong’s British legacy, following the international arms trading embargo imposed after the passing of the National Security Law in 2020, the HKPF had started importing firearms from Mainland China to refresh their inventory.

===Other uniforms===
Traffic Branch Motorcyclists: A heavy, bright, yellow and blue reflective jacket is worn. In warmer weather, a lightweight yellow reflective vest is an alternative. Black knee-high leather riding boots are also worn with navy blue riding trousers, along with protective gear such as gloves and a white helmet. A blue baseball-style cap is worn when not riding.

Rural Patrol Unit: Cargo shirt and trousers in olive green are worn with either a dark blue baseball-style cap or a navy blue beret. Cargo shirt and trousers in Disruptive Pattern Camouflage is also sometimes worn.

Other specialized units: In some specialized units, a cargo shirt is worn in either olive green, dark blue, or disruptive pattern camouflage (depending on the unit), along with matching cargo trousers, and a navy blue beret or a dark blue baseball-style cap.

===Ceremonial uniform===
Ceremonial uniforms include either a white (similar to No.3 Warm weather ceremonial uniform) or navy blue tunic (similar to the old winter uniform). Sword design was based on 1897 pattern British Army infantry officer&#x27;s sword and used for formal occasions such as parade out or Legal Opening Day. They are fitted with a black whistle on the front right pocket and insignia on the collar for commissioned officers. A Sam Browne belt is also worn.

===Retired uniforms===
The previous uniforms were reminiscent of the British colonial era, and were replaced with what were intended to be more modern, international, and cosmopolitan uniforms in 2005.

Retired summer uniform: A short-sleeved olive green tunic-style tropical field shirt, and olive green trousers worn with a black Sam Browne belt with shoulder strap. Female officers wore a short-sleeved beige shirt with a knee-length skirt until the mid-1990s when they were given the same uniform as male officers (without the shoulder strap). Bermuda shorts were worn by male officers instead of trousers from the early 20th century until the 1970s.

Retired winter uniform: A cornflower blue (or white, for commissioned officers) shirt with a blue and red striped necktie, worn under a heavy navy blue tunic coat and a Sam Browne Belt with shoulder strap, and navy blue trousers. The tunic may be removed and shirt sleeves folded up to the elbows when working indoors or in warmer weather.

Retired headgear: Pith helmets, turbans and conical hats were worn (depending on the ethnicity of the officer) in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Berets, peaked caps and bowler hats (for female officers) were introduced in the early to mid-20th century. Baseball-style caps for some specialized units were also introduced in the early 21st century.

Until 1998, all officers wore a black whistle lanyard over the left shoulder running under the epaulet with the double cord attached to a whistle tucked in to the left breast tunic pocket. Officers who had received a Commissioner of Police Commendation or HE Governor&#x27;s Commendation were issued a plaited black, yellow and red lanyard for CP&#x27;s Commendation, or red for Governor&#x27;s.
==Vehicles==

Most police vehicles in Hong Kong are white, with a blue and red 3M retroreflective stripe around on the sides of the vehicle with wording &quot;警 POLICE 察&quot; in white, the only exception being the armoured personnel carriers specially designed for the Police Tactical Unit, which are wholly dark blue and with wording &quot;警 POLICE 察&quot; on a light blue background in white on the sides of the vehicle. Most police vehicles in Hong Kong are equipped with both red and blue emergency vehicle lighting. The vehicles which are assigned to airport duties have additional yellow emergency vehicle lighting and yellow rooftops required for all airport vehicles. All police vehicles are government property and so bear license plates starting with &quot;AM&quot;.

Since 2008, the Hong Kong Police Force have brought in the use of Battenburg markings for new police vehicles of the Traffic Branch for better visibility on the roads. In addition, these new vehicles show the Force crest on the front part of the vehicle, which the Force has not used in the design of new vehicles for the last two decades.

The Hong Kong Police Force has ordered 10 new electric scooters for their officers to help reduce pollution in central Hong Kong. Emergency Unit, Police Tactical Unit, and Traffic Police have identification markings on the back of the car. For example, PTUD 1/3 means PTU D Team 1st Team 3rd car; EUKW 23 means Emergency Unit, Kowloon West region, 23rd car; and TKW 2 means Traffic unit, Kowloon West region, second car. Until 2007, EU, PTU, and TP vehicles had identification markings in a slightly different format. For example, “1/3 PTUD”, “23 EUKW”, and “2 TKW”.
==In popular culture==
The Hong Kong Police Force and its previous incarnation have been the subject of many films and television shows, including the locally produced &quot;Police Story&quot; film series, &quot;The Criminal Investigator&quot;, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; film series, &quot;Cold War&quot;, and &quot;OCTB&quot;. English language films featuring the HKPF include &quot;Rush Hour&quot; and &quot;Skyscraper&quot;.

The Hong Kong Police Force and Special Duties Unit have also appeared in popular video game series such as &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;.
