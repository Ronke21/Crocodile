<text>Chlorocardium rodiei (greenheart) is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is one of two species in the genus &quot;Chlorocardium&quot;. It is native to Guyana and Suriname in South America. Other common names include cogwood, demerara greenheart, greenhart, ispingo moena, sipiri, bebeeru and bibiru.

It is an evergreen tree growing 15 to 30 m tall with a trunk diameter of 35 to 60 cm. The leaves are oppositely arranged and simple with smooth edges. The fruit is a drupe containing a single seed.
The cyclic bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid rodiasine was first isolated from this species. The wood is extremely hard and strong, so hard that it cannot be worked with standard tools. It is durable in marine conditions, so it is used to build docks and other structures, and it was an early choice for fly fishing rods. An estimated 15 to 28% of the original population has been harvested. The species&#x27; use as a commercial timber began in the late 18th century, but most of the harvesting has taken place since the introduction of chainsaws in 1967.

It is often sought for construction projects in parts of the Caribbean, where wood ants are problematic in conventional pine wood construction. It was also used to build the dock gates in Liverpool, such as the Manchester dock gate. It has been used extensively as marine piling, since it is highly resistant to marine borers. It is also extremely dense, and does not float, therefore requiring special water transport arrangement, and is loaded onto specially constructed pontoons for transport to sawmill or direct shipping overseas. As sawn lumber it requires special treatment, and saws with tungsten carbide teeth, since standard steel saw blades cannot be maintained sharp enough to cut any reasonable quantity.

Greenheart was used to sheath the Norwegian fir planks that made up Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s barkentine ice-breaker, &quot;Endurance&quot; and the keel of the United States Coast Guard cutter USS Bear.

<text>Alfred Kerr (&quot;né&quot; Kempner; 25 December 1867 – 12 October 1948, surname: ) was an influential German theatre critic and essayist of Jewish descent, nicknamed the &quot;Kulturpapst&quot; (&quot;Culture Pope&quot;).

==Biography==

===Youth===

Kerr was born in Breslau, Silesia, the son of Helene (Calé) and Meyer Emanuel Kempner, who was a wine trader. He had one sister always known as Annchen: she married Siegfried Ollendorf and ultimately left Germany for Palestine. His family was Jewish. Alfred said while still at school that he intended to shorten his name to &quot;Kerr&quot;, which became official in 1909. He studied literature in Berlin with Erich Schmidt and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Halle. Alfred Kerr worked as a theatre critic for &quot;Der Tag&quot; and later for &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;, and &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;. He wrote weekly Berliner Briefe for the &quot;Breslauer Zeitung&quot; from 1895–1900 and for the &quot;Königsberger Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; from 1897 to 1922. With the publisher Paul Cassirer and the Arts Critic Julius Meier-Graefe he founded the artistic review &quot;Pan&quot; in 1910.

===Career===

Kerr changed his surname to avoid association with Friederike Kempner. Kerr was noted for his treatment of drama criticism as another branch of literary criticism. As his fame grew he engaged in polemics, with the critics Maximilian Harden, Herbert Ihering and Karl Kraus in particular. In the 1920s he was hostile to Bertolt Brecht, and assailed him with accusations of plagiarism.

===Exile===

In 1933 Kerr fled to Prague. His wife Julia and their children followed him to Switzerland later. They then went to Paris and then, after the purchase of a film script by Alexander Korda, to England, United Kingdom. (These years of exile are described, from a child&#x27;s perspective, by Kerr&#x27;s daughter, author Judith Kerr, in her &quot;Out of the Hitler Time&quot; trilogy.) His books were amongst those burnt in May 1933 by the Nazis when they came to power; Kerr had attacked the Nazi Party publicly very early on and Joseph Goebbels said before Adolf Hitler came to power that Kerr would be one of the first he would shoot. He lived in extreme poverty in London. He was a founder of the &quot;Freier Deutscher Kulturbund&quot;, and worked for the German PEN club. An old feud with Karl Kraus worked against him at the BBC.

Kerr became naturalised as a British subject in 1947. In 1948 he visited Hamburg at the start of a planned tour of several German cities but suffered a stroke, and then decided to end his own life via an overdose of Veronal, procured for him by his wife. He was buried, without references to religion according to his wishes, in Ohlsdorf Cemetery in the position &quot;Z 21-217&quot; and his wife was cremated with her ashes buried at the foot of his grave when she died in 1965.

The Alfred-Kerr-Preis für Literaturkritik was established in 1977. His Berliner Briefe for the &quot;Breslauer Zeitung&quot; were published as &quot;Wo liegt Berlin&quot; in 1997, &quot;Warum fliesst der Rhein nicht durch Berlin&quot; and as &quot;Was ist der Mensch in Berlin&quot; in 2017. &quot;Wo liegt Berlin&quot; was a best-seller and the proceeds were given by Michael and Judith Kerr to the Kerr Foundation in Berlin which awards an annual Kerr Prize for a young actor. An eight volume edition of his works has been published by S. Fischer, there is an extensive literature devoted to Kerr.

==Family==
Alfred Kerr married for the first time when he was over 50, to the much younger Ingeborg Thormählen. She died shortly afterwards in the 1918 flu pandemic while pregnant; the bereavement affected him deeply. His second marriage was to musician Julia Weismann (1898–1965) in 1920. Julia was the daughter of a Prussian Secretary of State, . The Kerrs&#x27; son Michael Kerr became a prominent British lawyer. Their daughter Judith Kerr wrote a three-volume autobiography and the children&#x27;s books &quot;The Tiger Who Came To Tea&quot; and the Mog series; the writer Matthew Kneale is her son with Nigel Kneale, the author of &quot;Quatermass&quot; scripts.

<text>Stephen Mack Stigler (born August 10, 1941) is the Ernest DeWitt Burton Distinguished Service Professor at the Department of Statistics of the University of Chicago. He has authored several books on the history of statistics; he is the son of the economist George Stigler.

Stigler is also known for Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy which states that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer – whose first formulation he credits to sociologist Robert K. Merton.

== Biography ==
Stigler was born in Minneapolis. He received his Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of California, Berkeley. His dissertation was on linear functions of order statistics, and his advisor was Lucien Le Cam. His research has focused on statistical theory of robust estimators and the history of statistics.

Stigler taught at University of Wisconsin–Madison until 1979 when he joined the University of Chicago. In 2006, he was elected to membership of the American Philosophical Society, and is a past president (1994) of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

His father was the economist George Stigler, who was a close friend of Milton Friedman.

<text>The Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF), colloquially known as Shabia, was an armed Marxist–Leninist organization that fought for the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia. It emerged in 1973 as a far-left to left-wing nationalist group that split from the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). After achieving Eritrean independence in 1991, it transformed into the People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), which serves as Eritrea&#x27;s sole legal political party.

==History==

===Origins===
In 1967, thirty-three men underwent six months of training in China, including Isaias Afwerki, an engineering student who had left Haile Selassie I University (Addis Ababa University) in 1966 to join the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), and Romodan Mohammed Nur, who had become commissar of the Fourth Zone after military training in Syria. Cuba also received ten individuals, including Ibrahim Affa, a skilled former marine commando, in 1968. Upon their return, these men improved the combat capabilities of the front but also intensified internal conflicts and feuds.

===1970s===
Disillusioned with incompetent and feuding leaders, many young dissidents left the ELF, forming competing organizations. Political disputes began to destroy the ELF from the inside, and some dissidents who did not leave the organization were killed. Efforts at rectification and unity failed, leading to the emergence of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) in August 1973, officially known as Shaabia (&quot;popular&quot; in its Arabic abbreviation) in 1977. Led by Isaias and Ramadan, the EPLF found refuge in the mountains of Sahel, successfully repelling repeated assaults from Nakfa, a garrison town on a high plateau. In order to avoid repeating ELF’s mistakes, they ensured members were not only being trained militarily but politically as well. All members received the same education, no matter their background, to maintain a sense of equality.

The EPLF faced immediate challenges, including a declaration of war by the ELF in mid-1972, leading to the &quot;first civil war&quot; ending inconclusively in 1974. Internal dissension within the EPLF, fueled by accusations of authoritarian practices and military shortcomings, was quelled by Isaias, resulting in the execution of eleven members in August 1974. This event contributed to the centralization and security focus of the EPLF. The Ethiopian Revolution shifted the balance in Eritrea, and a temporary truce allowed joint offensives by the fronts in 1976.

The First Congress of the EPLF occurred in January 1977 and formally set out the policies of this new organization. At this first meeting Romodan Mohammed Nur was elected Secretary-General and Isaias as Assistant Secretary-General. This program specifically targeted a liberalization of women&#x27;s rights as well as a broad educational policy for maintaining every language and improving literacy. It was also set out that the boundaries of an Eritrean state would be based on the colonial treaties of Italy.

From 1975 to 1977, the ELF and EPLF outnumbered the Ethiopian army and overran much of Eritrea. Only Asmara, Barentu, and the ports of Assab and Massawa remained under government control. The road between them cut, however, Asmara and Massawa were under siege. The hopes of a nationalist victory raised by the insurgents’ achievements and fear of the Red Terror drove thousands of young men and women to the fronts, principally to the EPLF. As most of the new recruits were Christian, highland society was no longer peripheral to the conflict. The success of the insurgents was due more to government weakness than their own strength. A counteroffensive in 1978 led to the EPLF&#x27;s strategic withdrawal, establishing a defensive line in 1979.

Ethiopia had the advantage of Soviet support beginning in 1977, which totaled over $11 billion in military funding and arms by the end of the war. On the other hand, the EPLF was scraping by monetarily and militarily, with most of their funds coming from the Eritrean diaspora and most of their supplies from seizing Ethiopian weapons after battles.

===1980s===

The fronts faced a lull in fighting in 1980–81, with the army engaged in operations against rebels. The uneasy peace between the fronts crumbled in August 1980, leading to the &quot;second civil war,&quot; where the ELF was decisively defeated a year later with assistance from the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF). Some ELF fighters joined the winning side, and those in Sudan were disarmed. The ELF ceased as an effective organization by the mid-1980s but continued sporadic operations in Eritrea. The EPLF emerged as the dominant force, defeating major operations in 1982 and 1983. In 1988, the EPLF achieved a historic victory, signaling the defeat of the military regime and the path to Eritrean independence. The organizational structure and guiding ideas played a crucial role in the EPLF&#x27;s success.

One of these guiding ideas was the EPLF&#x27;s focus on solving the problem politically. For example, in November 1980, the EPLF published their seven-point peace plan in an effort to create a focused political goal. At the top of the list was the need for a national referendum to allow the Eritrean people the right to self-determination. Another point called for a ceasefire to ensure the safety of the voters and the country. However, instead of accepting the plan, the Derg ignored the proposed plan and increased their attacks.

Between February and June 1982, over 80,000 Ethiopian troops launched a series of offensives known as the Red Star Campaign in an attempt to crush the EPLF. Despite these efforts, the government forces were thwarted by the EPLF. Rather than crushing the EPLF, the unsuccessful operation had the opposite effect, strengthening it. This outcome led to an increased fervor among the Eritrean people, who rallied behind the EPLF.

Growing from around four hundred men organized in squads, the EPLA became a formidable force by the mid-1980s. The primary combat component was the strategic mobile forces, consisting of permanent units like brigades and divisions. The smallest operational unit was the mesre (squad), followed by ganta (platoon), hayli (company), and bottoloni (battalion). The brigade, comprising three battalions, was the largest unit until the mid-1980s when it was surpassed by the division. Remarkably, nearly a third of the EPLA&#x27;s total force and 15 percent of its frontline combat units were women, challenging traditional gender roles. However, women remained underrepresented in leadership positions. Specialized units within the EPLA effectively employed guerrilla and conventional tactics. By the end of the 1980s, the EPLA consisted of six divisions, fourteen infantry brigades, four mechanized brigades, and various specialized units.

The EPLF, led by a general staff headed by Sebhat Ephrem after 1987, emphasized decentralization and local initiative during defensive guerrilla tactics. Command became more centralized during conventional offensives. The insurgents relied on light and portable equipment, with the AK-47 being the primary individual weapon. Leaving the EPLF was practically impossible, and instances of kidnapping and forcible conscription were reported. Child soldiers, drafted as young as ten, were used between 1979 and 1983 but this policy was abandoned due to internal and external criticism.

The Second Congress in 1987, brought together the EPLF and the Eritrean Liberation Front/Central Leadership (also sometimes referred to as Central Command, CC) in what was called the &quot;Unity Congress&quot;. This was the culmination of negotiations over three years which had brought together the two fighting forces in October 1986, under a unified command. On this congress, Isaias Afewerki replaced secretary-general Ramadan Nur. Subsequently, the movement abandoned most of its formerly Marxist–Leninist ideology, in favour of an own revolutionary left-wing concept and a more comprehensive and pragmatic approach to unite all Eritrean nationalists. This approach was entitled the &quot;National Democratic Program,&quot; and included objectives for the creation and development of Eritrea. It consisted of an 11-point plan, the first point of which was the forming of the nation. The following points emphasized protecting political, social, and religious rights, with the last being a call for a neutral position in foreign policy.

The EPLF won its most resounding victory in March 1988 at the Battle of Afabet. It destroyed the most formidable Ethiopian garrison in northern Eritrea and marked a pivotal moment, setting off a chain of events leading to total victory three years later. After Afabet the front became a virtually unstoppable insurgent force as it began its campaign aimed for the strategic port of Massawa. The Ethiopian army, caught in a long-simmering crisis and plagued by internal divisions, underestimated the resilience, skill, and adaptability of the rebels. Af Abet, one of the three crucial turning points in the Eritrean war, severely weakened the military&#x27;s capacity to wage war and foreshadowed the downfall of the dictatorship, paving the way for Eritrean independence. The battle&#x27;s strategic significance has been likened to the Vietnamese triumph against the French at Diebienphu. As its success grew the EPLF began attracting a wave of new support.

===1990s=== 
After another defeat at Shire in 1989, the EPLF went on the offensive in 1990 directed at Massawa. This offensive was known as Massawa and resulted in EPLF seizing the city and defeating the Ethiopian garrison. The defeat was complete, catastrophic, and irreversible. Even the vengeful bombing, which persisted until the end of March and resulted in the destruction of numerous historic Islamic buildings, could not alter the disastrous outcome. Isaias Afewerki, leader of the victorious army, concurs, acknowledging it as a victory of the greatest strategic value in the history of the struggle.

The Third and last Congress of the EPLF was held in 1994 in Asmara. It was important as it converted the Front from a military organization to a purely political movement. At the time, the organization had 95,000 members. At this Congress, the name of the organization was changed to the People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ).

<doc id="1276719" wikidata="Q741563" url="?curid=1276719" title="Poznań University of Medical Sciences">
<text>Poznan University of Medical Sciences () is a prominent Polish medical university, located in the city of Poznań in western Poland. It traces its beginnings to the foundation of Poznań University in 1919, and was formed as a separate institution in 1950. It gained the status of university in 2007.

==History==
The history of Poznan University of Medical Sciences started in 1919 when a pharmaceutical department was created at the University of Poznań. A year later (in 1920) the Faculty of Medicine was founded within it (in fact, this faculty existed since 1919 as a part of Poznań Society of Friends of Arts and Sciences). The chair of Dentistry was created in 1929. The first rector of Poznan University was and first dean of the Faculty of Medicine was Professor .

In the late autumn of 1939, the University of Poznań was closed by German occupation authorities, but many of its professors continued to teach. In 1940 an underground University of the Western Lands was formed in Warsaw which comprised the faculties of Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry, with most of the faculty coming from the Poznań University. In 1941, the Polish School of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh was founded, where the first dean was surgeon Antoni Jurasz from the University of Poznań. In the last months of the war, during the battle of Poznań, preparations for reopening of the university were begun. The university officially reopened in April 1945, before the end of the war.

According to a plan of reform in 1950, the Medical Faculty, with the Department of Dentistry and the Faculty of Pharmacy of University of Poznań, were detached to form an independent school named the University of Medical Sciences. In 1975 a new Faculty of Nursing was founded, and in 1979 a Department of Medical Analytics was opened. In 1984, the Sejm (the Polish national parliament) named the school after Karol Marcinkowski, a distinguished Polish physician and patriot of the first half of the 19th century who had lived in Poznań, and who was a symbol of the highest professional and ethical values in medicine. In 1992 the Faculty of Medicine was divided into Faculty of Medicine I, responsible for the six-year Polish MD program, and Faculty of Medicine II, comprising the divisions of Dentistry, Post Graduate Medical Education and Medicine and Dentistry with English as the teaching language.

In 1991, the university introduced programs in English, starting in 1993 with the four-year MD program based entirely on the American curriculum and the requirements of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) system. A six-year MD program in English based on the European model followed a year later. Both programs have instituted National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject examinations and compulsory completion on USMLE licensing examinations as a requirement for students. Subsequently, PUMS reached the last of its planned English-language based projects with the introduction of a five-year Dentistry program in 2000, and five-year MSc Pharmacy program in 2004, which was replaced by the six-year Pharm. D. program in 2009, and three-year BSc Physiotherapy program in 2009. These programs meet the European requirements. The students of the English programs are represented by the English Programs&#x27; Student Union (EPSU).

The major research topics in the Faculty of Pharmacy are the stability of drugs, pharmacokinetics and biochemistry, the synthesis and analysis of new therapeutic agents, phytochemistry, toxicology and pharmacology.

The fields of research activity of the Faculty of Health Sciences are health promotion, nursing processes and standards in nursing activity.

The investigations conducted at the university are presented in several hundred research papers published yearly in professional journals.

The university hosts between 5 and 10 major international congresses a year and visits of foreign researchers are a daily routine. The university co-operates regularly with universities in Rennes and Rouen (France), Turku (Finland), Berlin, Göttingen, Halle, Kiel, Magdeburg, Mainz, Munchen Regensburg (Germany), Linköping (Sweden), Oslo University College (Norway), Perugia (Italy), University of Illinois at Chicago (USA).

Many university staff members serve on the boards of international professional and scientific associations or are invited to act as advisers by the WHO and IAEA. Lekarsz and Doktor (stopień naukowy) degrees awarded at the university enjoy wide national recognition. In some countries, e.g. Germany, they are accepted with no further confirmation requirements. They are routinely accepted in Sweden, Britain, the United States and Canada. At present more than 1200 graduates of the university practice or research abroad. Many of them are clinical specialists and heads of hospital departments in Europe, North America, South Africa and elsewhere.

Scientific research constitutes a significant part of Medical University activity. The scope of scientific research conducted by the university ranges in solving problems of basic medical and clinical studies.

<doc id="1276728" wikidata="Q8055711" url="?curid=1276728" title="Yorkshire Engine Company Janus">
<text>The Yorkshire Engine Company Janus is a line of 0-6-0 wheel arrangement, diesel–electric locomotives that weighed and had a maximum speed of . The two Rolls-Royce C6SFL diesel engines gave a total power output of . Each engine had its cooling system at the outer end, and its generator at the inner end. There were two traction motors, each being powered by one generator, thus simplifying the electrical system.

== Service ==

A total of 102 Janus locomotives were built: mostly for the British steel industry, but other customers included Imperial Chemical Industries (12 locomotives), the Port of London Authority (10), and the National Coal Board (7). Three locomotives were exported: one to Jamaica, and two to the Indian Fertilizer Corporation. The Indian locomotives were , and were the only narrow gauge units built. In addition, three modified Janus locomotives – gauge on Bo-Bo trucks – were exported to British Guyana.

Later locomotives had their Rolls-Royce engine uprated by 10 per cent to each. After Rolls-Royce entered the industrial locomotive manufacturing business, YEC started to offer their locomotives with Cummins diesel engines; seven Janus locomotives were built with pairs of Cummins diesels – all for Appleby Frodingham Steel works.

The name Janus is from the two-faced god Janus: the locomotive was symmetrical with two &#x27;faces&#x27;. The similarity in power and speed would indicate that this type of locomotive could have been used in a similar role to the British Rail Class 08 shunter. In recent years the Class 08 shunters owned by DB Cargo UK have replaced Janus locomotives on some industrial railways.

== Loans to British Railways ==
One locomotive was demonstrated to British Railways; it was the second of this type built (works number 2595 of 1956), both the first two locomotives being demonstrated to potential customers before going to the Appleby-Frodingham Steel works in Scunthorpe. It is thought to have been in use there until being scrapped in 1982.

=== Other locomotives loaned ===
In July 1961, an 0-6-0 diesel–hydraulic locomotive was demonstrated on British Railways. It weighed and was powered by a single Rolls-Royce C8SFL engine giving . The design was similar to a lengthened British Rail Class 02. The locomotive was tested near Derby for four days, and following the demonstration was delivered to Llanwern steelworks, Newport.

One 600 hp 0-8-0 diesel hydraulic, a Taurus, was demonstrated and tested on British Railways during 1961 and 1962. It was a ‘trip’ locomotive intended to carry out shunting work and hauling local (short distance) goods trains. This was the duty for which the British Rail Class 14 locomotives were built in 1963.

== Preservation ==
In 2008, 23 were still in industrial service, and seven had been preserved. In November 2016 the seven Cummins engined locomotives at Scunthorpe British Steel works, formerly Appleby Froddingham Steel works, were replaced by German-made NSB Di 8 locomotives, originally built for use on main-line freight operations in Norway.

YE 2868 0-6-0DE &quot;Ludstone&quot; has been undergoing restoration since 2015 at the Foxfield Railway in collaboration with the Industrial Diesel &amp; Railway Preservation Group.

YE 2791 DE5, built in 1962, is cosmetically restored and on display at Rocks by Rail, The Living Ironstone Museum, Cottesmore.

YE 2670, built in September 1959, which worked at Stanton Iron Works, Ilkeston, is preserved at Stainmore Railway Company.

YE 2748 (NCB Number 6), built in 1959 and allocated to Littleton Colliery is in use at Churnet Valley Railway where it is employed on shunting duties. It has been named &quot;Roger H Bennett&quot;, after Roger Bennett, a volunteer on the Churnet Valley Railway.

YE 2877 (BSC Scunthorpe Works No: 1) is in operation at the Appleby Frodingham Railway.

== Models ==
In 2016 Oxford Diecast, in conjunction with Golden Valley Hobbies produced a OO gauge model, with a choice of BP, National Coal Board, Imperial Chemical Industries, Port of London Authority, and Allied Steel and Wire livery.

A finescale etched kit is also available from Judith Edge and can be built to 00, EM and P4 gauges.

<text>==J. Elfreth Watkins Sr.==
John Elfreth Watkins Sr. (1852–1903) was Curator of Mechanical Technology at the United States National Museum (Smithsonian Institution). He received his education at Lafayette College, graduating in 1871, and worked first for the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, as a mining engineer, for a year, and then for the Pennsylvania Railroad as assistant engineer of construction. Disabled in 1873 by an accident that resulted in the loss of his right leg, he was reassigned to the Amboy division of the railroad. In 1883 he became chief clerk of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad and in 1884 chief clerk of the Amboy division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. 

In that same year, he became Honorary Curator of Transportation at the National Museum, taking the job full-time after two years. He left to organize the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s exhibits at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition; stayed in Chicago for a year organizing the Department of Industrial Arts at the Field Columbian Museum; and then returned to the Smithsonian, where he was curator of Mechanical Technology until his death in 1903. 

He played a key role in the preservation of the &quot;John Bull&quot; steam locomotive and its subsequent public displays by the Smithsonian Institution.

==J. Elfreth Watkins Jr.==

In 1900, his son John Elfreth Watkins Jr. (1875–?) contributed an article to the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, entitled &quot;What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years&quot;.
Watkins Jr.&#x27;s predictions were remarkably accurate for 1900.

The prize money AUD$20,000, was the richest and most prestigious award for an unpublished manuscript in Australia. Allen &amp; Unwin guaranteed to publish the winning work.

==History==
The award had been initiated in 1979 by Niels Stevns and was a collaboration between &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper, the publisher Allen &amp; Unwin, and Stevns &amp; Company Pty Ltd. Stevns, founder of the company which made Vogel bread, named the award in honour of Swiss naturopath Alfred Vogel.

The Vogel was not awarded in 1985, 2013, and 2019.

The last award was presented in June 2024.

==&quot;The Australian&quot; Fiction Prize==
The Vogel Prize was replaced by &quot;The Australian&quot; Fiction Prize by &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper in partnership with publisher HarperCollins. The new prize is for an unpublished manuscript–excluding science fiction, young adult, poetry, plays, works for children–of between 75,000 and 100,000 words, and the prize continues at $20,000, plus a $15,000 advance from the publisher, HarperCollins, who will publish the work; there is now no age limit on the entrant, but the entrant must an Australian resident. Submissions in the prize&#x27;s first year opened on 6 May 2024 and closed on 2 August 2024. The judges are Caroline Overington, literary editor of &quot;The Australian&quot;; book critic and literary agent Samuel Bernard; and bookseller Letitia Davy of Gleebooks.

<doc id="1276759" wikidata="Q1699287" url="?curid=1276759" title="Tigray People's Liberation Front">
<text>The Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF; ), also known as the Tigrayan People&#x27;s Liberation Front, is a left-wing ethnic nationalist, paramilitary group, and the former ruling party of Ethiopia. It was classified as a terrorist organization by the Ethiopian government during the Tigray War until its removal from the list in 2023. In older and less formal texts and speech it is known as Woyane () or Weyané ().

The TPLF was founded on February 18, 1975, in Dedebit, Tigray. Within 16 years, it grew from about a dozen men to become the most powerful armed liberation movement in Ethiopia. Unlike the Eritrean or Somali liberation fronts at the time, the TPLF did not seek independence from the Ethiopian state; instead, it aimed to overthrow the central government and implement its own version of the Ethiopian revolution. From 1989 to 2018, it led a political coalition, the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). It fought a 15-year-long war against the Derg regime, which was overthrown on 28 May 1991. The TPLF, with the support of the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF), overthrew the government of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) on May 28, 1991, and installed a new government that remained in power for decades. 

The new ruling EPRDF government, was dominated by the TPLF, who gradually consolidated control over Ethiopia&#x27;s federal administrations, the ENDF, and key economic resources such as foreign aid, loans, and land leases, amassing billions. The TPLF&#x27;s restructuring of Ethiopia into an ethnic federal state further fueled civil conflicts in the ensuing decades.

The TPLF lost control of the federal government in 2018. During the Tigray War that began in 2020, the National Election Board of Ethiopia terminated the party&#x27;s legal status. In 2021, the Ethiopian House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives formally approved a parliamentary resolution designating the TPLF as a terrorist organization. On 2 November 2022, the African Union brokered a deal in Pretoria, South Africa, between the federal government and the TPLF to end the Tigray War. As per the peace agreement, the TPLF began disarming in January 2023. 

Following the Pretoria peace agreement in 2022, the TPLF began experiencing severe internal divisions.

==History==
===Origins===
The TPLF is considered to be the product of the marginalization of Tigrayans within Ethiopia after Menelik II of Shewa became emperor in 1889. The Tigrayan traditional elite and peasantry had a strong regional identity and a resentment due to their own perception of the decline of Tigray. It was popularly referred to as Woyane, for evoking memories of the armed revolt of 1942–43 (the First Woyane) against the re-establishment of imperial rule after Italian occupation remained alive and provided an important reference for the new generations of educated Tigrayan nationalists.

At Haile Selassie I University (now Addis Ababa University), Tigrayan students had formed the Political Association of Tigrayans (PAT) in 1972 and the Tigrayan University Students&#x27; Association (TUSA) beginning in the early 1960s. These student groups evolved into a radical nationalist group that operated in Tigray after the start of the Ethiopian revolution in 1974, and began calling for Tigrayan independence, forming the Tigray Liberation Front (TLF). Meanwhile, a Marxist current emerged in TUSA that advocated national self-determination for Tigray within a revolutionary, democratic Ethiopia.

While the multinational leftist movements prioritized class struggle over national self-determination for the Ethiopian nationalities, the Marxists of the TUSA argued for self-determination as the starting point for the final socialist revolution because of the existing inequalities among the Ethiopian nationalities.

===1974–1977===
In February 1974, the Marxists within TUSA welcomed the Ethiopian Revolution but opposed the Derg (a military junta that ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1991), as they were convinced that it would neither lead a genuine socialist revolution nor correctly resolve the Ethiopian nationality question. Two days after the Derg took power, on 14 September 1974, seven leaders of this trend established the &quot;Association of Progressives of the Tigray Nation&quot; (, &quot;Maḥbär Gäsgästi Bəḥer Təgray&quot;), also known as the Tigrayan National Organization (TNO). The founders were: Alemseged Mengesha (nom de guerre: Haylu), Ammaha Tsehay (Abbay), Aregawi Berhe (Berhu), Embay Mesfin (Seyoum), Fentahun Zere&#x27;atsion (Gidey), Mulugeta Hagos (Asfeha), and Zeru Gesese (Agazi). The TNO was to prepare the ground for the future armed movement in Tigray. 

It secretly approached both the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) and the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF) for support, but the ELF already had relations with the TLF. In November 1974, the EPLF agreed to train TNO members and allowed EPLF fighters from the Tigrayan community in Eritrea, including Mehari Tekle (Mussie), to join the TPLF. The first group of trainees was sent to the EPLF in January 1975.

On the night of 18 February 1975, eleven men, including Gesese Ayyele (Sehul), Gidey, Asfeha, Seyoum, Agazi, and Berhu, left Enda Selassie for Sehul&#x27;s home area of Dedebit, where they founded the TPLF (original name , &quot;Tägadlo Ḥarənnät Ḥəzbi Təgray&quot;, &quot;The Popular Struggle for the Freedom of Tigray&quot;). Welde Selassie Nega (Sebhat), Legese Zenawi (Meles), and others soon joined the original group, and, after the arrival of the trainees from Eritrea in June 1975, the TPLF had about 50 fighters. It then elected a formal leadership consisting of Sehul (the chairman), Muse (the military commander), and the seven TNO founders. Berhu was appointed political commissar. Sehul played a crucial role in helping the nascent TPLF establish itself among the local peasantry.

The TPLF embraced a Marxist vision focused on &#x27;radical decentralization&#x27; of the Ethiopian state. In contrast to the Eritrean and Somali liberation movements, the TPLF sought not independence, but the overthrow of the central government to establish its own revolutionary framework for Ethiopia. 

Although a few successful raids bolstered its military credibility, the TPLF grew to only about 120 fighters in early 1976, but a rapidly growing clandestine network of supporters in the cities and a support base among the peasants provided vital supplies and information. On February 18, 1976, a conference of fighters elected a new leadership: Berhu (chairman), Muse (military committee), Abbay (political committee), Agazi (socioeconomic committee), Seyoum (foreign relations), Gidey, and Sebhat. Meles became head of the political cadre school.

The first three years of its existence were marked by a constant struggle for survival, unstable cooperation with Eritrean forces, and power struggles against the other Tigrayan fronts: in 1975, the TPLF liquidated the TLF; in 1976–78, it fought the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU) in Shire; and in 1978, the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (EPRP) in East Tigray. The front also suffered heavy losses from Derg offensives in the region.

Although the TPLF, the ELF, and the EPLF cooperated during the 1976 and 1978 Derg offensives in Tigray and Eritrea, no stable alliance emerged. The ELF resented the liquidation of the TLF and considered the relationship between the EPLF and the TPLF a serious threat. Since 1977, there had been conflict between ELF and the TPLF over the issue of Eritrean settlers in western Tigray, who were organized at ELF and rejected the TPLF&#x27;s land reform. Relations with the EPLF also did not develop smoothly. Its material support was much less than the TPLF had anticipated. Politically, the EPLF favored the multinational EPRP over the ethno regionalist TPLF with its separatist agenda at the time.

===1978–1990===
After the Derg&#x27;s victory in the Ogaden War in February 1978 and Mengistu Haile Mariam&#x27;s new support from the Soviets permitted the substantial growth of his forces, the TPLF&#x27;s momentum seemed to slow. During the TPLFs early years, the Derg was primarily focused on the Eritrean and Somali insurgencies, allowing it to avoid the full force of the Ethiopian military as its numbers grew to 20,000 strong.

In February 1979, the TPLF held its first regular congress. It declared its struggle the Second Woyane (&quot;kalay wäyyanä&quot;) and changed its Tigrinya name to &quot;Həzbawi Wäyyanä Harənnät Təgray&quot;. It adopted a new political program calling for self-determination within a democratic Ethiopia, with independence an option only if unity proved impossible. Gaining and maintaining the support of the local population was at the core of the TPLF&#x27;s strategy in the 1970s and 1980s. TPLF leaders knew that the goodwill of the population would sustain their movement and ultimately lead them to victory over the Derg. Consequently, any fighter caught mistreating locals was punished or even executed by TPLF authorities. As a result, local support for the TPLF was consistent and invaluable. The local population shared food and resources with the fighters, provided them with safe havens, and, most importantly, provided the TPLF with up-to-date information.

In retrospect, it is evident that the 1978-1985 period further strengthened the TPLF. The increasingly alienating intervention of the Derg, the front&#x27;s handling of famine and refugee problems, and the foreign connections it built through its mission in Khartoum, enabled the movement to mobilize and better equip more fighters to prepare for the shift from guerrilla to frontal attack. Moreover, developments within the TPLF in the mid-1980s led to a conceptual shift from a struggle for the liberation of Tigray to that of all Ethiopia.

They established their headquarters in caves in Addi Geza&#x27;iti, some 50 kilometers west of Mekelle. The Ethiopian People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (EPDM), a TPLF-loyal splinter group from the EPRP, used caves in Melfa (Dogu&#x27;a Tembien).
The TPLF managed to use the catastrophic famine of 1983-85 to its advantage. In early 1985, it organized a march of over 200,000 famine victims from Tigray to Sudan to draw international attention to the plight in Tigray. Its humanitarian arm, the Relief Society of Tigray (REST), founded in 1978, received large amounts of international humanitarian aid for famine victims and small-scale development projects in liberated Tigray.

In 1984–1985, the TPLF diverted Western aid money intended for starving civilians to purchase weapons.

A power struggle in the leadership saw future Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi rise to power during 1985. In July 1985, the Marxist–Leninist League of Tigray (MLLT) was founded at a congress of a few hundred selected cadres. The MLLT was to be the nucleus of the future Marxist–Leninist vanguard party for all Ethiopia. The MLLT invited the genuine revolutionaries in the ranks of the &quot;Derg&quot; regime, which was busy organizing its own communist party, the Ethiopian Workers&#x27; Party, to join it.

In December 1988, the TPLF and EPDM formed the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) as the core of the planned United Democratic Front. In the spring of 1989, first the MLLT and then the TPLF held a congress. Abbay was elected chairman of both organizations, but toward the end of 1989 Meles became chairman of both. In May 1989, the EPDM formed the Ethiopian Marxist–Leninist Force (EMLF).

In July 1989, MLLT and EMLF formed the Union of Ethiopian Proletarian Organizations. In April 1990, the TPLF formed the Ethiopian Democratic Officers Movement from politically re-educated captured Ethiopian officers to undermine the Free Officers Movement, which had been formed in 1987 by exiled Ethiopian officers in opposition to the Derg. In May 1990, Oromo members of the EPDM and politically re-educated Oromo prisoners of war founded the Oromo Peoples&#x27; Democratic Organization (OPDO) to deny the Oromo Liberation Front&#x27;s claim to be the exclusive representative of the Ethiopian Oromo.

In November 1990, a Marxist–Leninist Oromo movement was established within the OPDO. Also in 1990, the TPLF formed the Afar Democratic Union to undermine the Afar movements. It had already helped build liberation fronts in Gambella and Benshangul before 1985.

In early 1988, the EPLF and the TPLF went on the offensive. The evolving situation in both Eritrea and Tigray, as well as the changing international context after the breakup of the Soviet bloc, prompted the TPLF and EPLF to put aside their differences and resume military cooperation. in 1989, the EPRDF formed a shadow government in Ethiopia to administer the liberated areas under its control.

===1991–2018===
In February 1991, the EPRDF began its offensive against the ruling regime with the support of a large EPLF contingent. On May 28, 1991, the EPRDF captured Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, and took control of the country. In July 1991, the EPRDF established the Transitional Government of Ethiopia. In May 1991, the TPLF had 80,000 fighters, the EPDM had 8,000, and the OPDO had 2,000. The total number of TPLF members was well over 100,000.

Reacting to the international political context after the demise of communism, the EPRDF and TPLF dropped all Marxist references in their political discourse and adopted a program of change based on multi-party politics, constitutional democracy, ethno-linguistic federalization, and a mixed economy. The TPLF restructured the Ethiopian state and introduced ethnic federalism, which has contributed significantly to civil conflicts in Ethiopia over the following decades.

Under the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the nation was governed by TPLF leader Meles Zenawi who became the first prime minister. The EPRDF government, particularly in areas concerning the military-security complex and the economy, was dominated by the TPLF. Gradually the TPLF hegemony within the EPRDF grew stronger as the party dominated Ethiopia&#x27;s federal administrations and the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) officer corps. The party exercised, &quot;near-exclusive control over foreign aid, international loans, and the leasing of public land to amass billions of dollars.&quot; With the EPRDF effectively under TPLF control, the Tigrayan position in Ethiopian governance post-1991 mirrored the political dominance that the Amharas had held in the country during most of the 20th century.

PM Meles Zenawi purged many members of the TPLF who opposed him, and a 2001 split in the party nearly saw his removal. Following Zenawi&#x27;s death in 2012, the organization quickly splintered into factions of Meles loyalists, young technocrats in Addis and party officials in Mekelle. These factions took a wide range of positions on core issues, paralyzing the TPLF. Zenawi&#x27;s handpicked successor, Halemariam Desalegn, proved too weak to manage growing internal strife in Ethiopia.

Over the years the TPLF&#x27;s position in the EPRDF weakened as Amhara and Oromo parties pushed backed against Tigrayan dominance. After 30 years of TPLF-based authoritarian rule, strong popular opposition to the dominance of the party emerged across the country during 2016. Amhara and Oromo elites came to an agreement to reform the TPLF created system, resulting in the accession of Abiy Ahmed to Prime Minister of Ethiopia in the following years. Internal power struggles within the EPRDF and its inability to quell popular protests resulted in a major political transition and Abiy Ahmed&#x27;s election in 2018.

===2018–2020===
During 2018, newly elected prime minister Abiy began curtailing the influence and position of the TPLF within Ethiopian politics. In June of that year he unexpectedly sacked the two most powerful TPLF members since Zenawi&#x27;s death - Samora Yunis (army chief of staff) and Getachew Assef (intelligence chief). The party felt threatened as Abiy carried out significant reforms that aimed to merge Ethiopia&#x27;s ethnic parties and reduce the TPLF&#x27;s influence.

In November 2019, PM Abiy and the chairman of the EPRDF unified the constituent parties of the coalition into the new Prosperity Party. The TPLF viewed this merger as illegal and did not participate. Abiy called on the TPLF to dissolve and become part of his newly established Prosperity Party. Many TPLF leaders began shifting from the nation&#x27;s capital of Addis Ababa to the Tigray regional state capital of Mekelle. In this period the organization recruited a substantial amount of fighters from different groups such as the police and paramilitary organizations, while also withdrawing its supporters from the Ethiopian national security establishment. This precipitated the Tigray War in late 2020. As TPLF leaders and parliament members began shifting back to Mekelle, the organization began to challenge the administration of Abiy Ahmed.

In June 2020, the Ethiopian parliament—to which the TPLF was a party—voted to postpone the 2021 Ethiopian General Election, which was originally scheduled to occur in 2020. The TPLF defied the parliamentary vote and held regional elections anyway. The 2020 Tigray regional election was held on 9 September 2020. 2.7 million people participated in the election, though was it was boycotted by Arena Tigray and the Tigray Democratic Party. PM Abiy stated that the federal government would not recognize the results of the Tigray election and banned foreign journalists from traveling to the region document it.

===2020–2022===
In November 2020, a civil conflict erupted between the TPLF and the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) when the TPLF attacked the ENDF Northern Command headquarters in the north of the country in what TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda described as a &quot;preemptive strike&quot;. In November 2020, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared victory over the TPLF. Other sources suggested that the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) controlled only about 70% of the Tigray region. Many TPLF members joined the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF). The TPLF has accused the ENDF and Eritrean forces of war crimes, but it is difficult to independently verify these allegations because of the media blackout imposed by the federal government under Abiy. On March 23, 2021, in response to international pressure, the prime minister admitted for the first time that Eritrean forces had been in the Tigray region. In July 2021, after the Ethiopian government declared a unilateral cease-fire and withdrew from much of the Tigray region, the TDF entered neighboring Afar and Amhara regions. The ENDF then launched its own counteroffensive and recaptured these regions by December 2021. By March 2022, the war had come to a virtual standstill. On 2 November 2022, the Pretoria Peace Agreement was signed, ending the Tigray War.

The TPLF was accused of forcing recruitment into the TDF, including minors. According to several witnesses and Tigrayan administrators, every household in Tigray was required to enlist a family member in the TDF. Those who refused were arrested and imprisoned, including the parents of minors who refused to enlist.

=== 2022–present ===
After the Tigray War significantly reshaped the region&#x27;s political landscape, the TPLF faced deepening divisions following the signing of the Pretoria Agreement. These divisions emerged between two factions: a &#x27;hardline&#x27; group led by TPLF chairman Debretsion Gebremichael and a &#x27;conciliatory&#x27; group led by deputy chairperson Getachew Reda. The power struggle between the Debretsion and Getachew has raised concerns of the creation of a volatile political environment that could reignite the civil war. The TPLF also suffers a crisis of legitimacy among the Tigrayan population following the war. In July 2024, the TPLF released a statement announcing it faced an unprecedented &#x27;severe test&#x27; that has brought the party to the verge of disintegration. The statement accused senior leaders of putting their personal interests above the party, thus threatening its existence.

During August 2024, the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) rejected the TPLF&#x27;s request to reinstate its pre-war legal status. On 12 August, chairman Debretsion declared that NEBE&#x27;s decision undermined the TPLF&#x27;s 50-year legacy and violated the Pretoria deal which had ended the Tigray War during November 2022. Following the decision, the federal government announced that the issue of TPLF registration and legality had been resolved. NEBE also warned against the convening a congress without the election boards approval or monitoring.

==== 14th party congress and growing internal split ====

On 13 August 2024, the TPLF began its controversial 14th party congress in Mekelle, ignoring the NEBE&#x27;s warning. The last congress had been held in September 2018. 14 members of the party&#x27;s central committee, including deputy chair Getachew, boycotted the congress. Getachew described it as, &quot;illegal movements by a group that does not represent the TPLF&quot; several days before it was due to be held. Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed warned that the TPLF could find itself in a war if it went ahead with holding the congress. As the six day long meeting commenced on 13 August, an Ethiopian government minister accused the TPLF of &quot;practically nullifying&quot; the Pretoria agreement and threatening the peace. Debretsion stated that the congress was unprecedented and warned those gathered that the party&#x27;s situation had &quot;gone from bad to worse&quot;. 

Since the 14th party congress, factionalism within the TPLF escalated as both sides became more entrenched in their positions. Debretsion effectively has popular support and power over the TPLF party apparatus, while Getachew maintains authority over Tigray&#x27;s interim regional government and is being backed by the Ethiopian federal government. There is a growing risk the internal split will escalate into the outbreak of violence as it becomes more intractable. In the period following, Debretsion&#x27;s faction removed Getachew and several other officials from their roles in the administration, claiming they &quot;no longer have the authority to lead, make decisions, or issue directives.&quot; In response, the interim administration has accused Debretsion&#x27;s group of attempting to destabilize Tigray through a coup d&#x27;état. Getachews administration has warned that it would pursue legal action against Debretsion&#x27;s faction for allegedly sowing &quot;chaos and anarchy&quot;.

On 10 November 2024, Getachew released a statement declaring that Debretsion Gebremichael&#x27;s TPLF was plotting an &#x27;official coup&#x27; against the interim regional government. He claimed that this faction within the TPLF has escalated from merely obstructing his government to actively plotting to overthrow it.

==Election results==
Elections from 1995 to 2015 were conducted under the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front banner.
==Ideology==
The party has its roots in the 1960s student movement which was ideologically nationalist before shifting towards Marxism–Leninism in late 1960s. After revolutionary students formed the Tigray University Student Association, a new leftwing organization known as the Tigrayan National Organization was founded in 1974, from which the TPLF emerged in February 1975. The core ideology of the party was ethnonationalism infused with the theme of a class-based - ethnonationalism is the fundamental foundation of the party and it persisted throughout the entire existence of the TPLF. The TPLF argues that Ethiopia is a collection of nationalities subjugated by the Amhara ethnic group, which imposes its culture and language over all others; the first manifesto of the party stated: &quot;Disagreement and suspicion among the nations of Ethiopia have resulted from the worsening of the oppression by the Amhara ethnic group over the oppressed nations of Ethiopia and especially over the Tigray ethnic group. Therefore, we now reached a stage where all the oppressed nations of Ethiopia can no more undertake a common class struggle.&quot;

The TPLF castigated the formation of the centralized empire state during the conquests of Menelik II as, &quot;the beginning of national oppression&quot; in the groups manifesto. Initially the group called for independence of Tigray from Ethiopia, arguing that it is the only way to liberate Ethiopian cultures from the ethnic and national oppression of the Amhara culture. However, separatism was abandoned in 1978, which subsequently led to defections and splits within the party. It was increasingly dominated by a faction known as the Marxist–Leninist League of Tigray, which took over the leadership of the party and proclaimed Marxism–Leninism to be the organization&#x27;s overarching ideology. The party&#x27;s ideological shift made Marxist aspects temporarily dominate over the ethnonationalist ones, though the party remained ethnonationalist and envisioned a &#x27;national revolution&#x27; that would install &quot;a planned socialist economy free of exploitation of man by man&quot;. Core Marxist aspects embraced by the TPLF included vanguardism, democratic centralism, dictatorship of the proletariat, and also self-determination in the name of national liberation. The party was also heavily influence by the Albanian communist model of Enver Hoxha, stressing self-reliant economy and every nation having its unique way towards socialism.

After the fall of the USSR, the TPLF moderated itself and rebranded its ideology as &quot;revolutionary democracy&quot;, pledging to introduce a new kind of democracy in Ethiopia that would differ from the liberal democratic structure, while also maintaining the core socialist values of the party. The concept of revolutionary democracy came from Lenin&#x27;s 1919 thesis &quot;Bourgeois Democracy and the Proletarian Dictatorship&quot;, which proposed replacing the &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; parliamentary democracy with revolutionary democracy, which would be secured by a vanguard party representing the masses, which would consult its constituency while still adhering to the socialist ideological guidelines. Meles Zenawi wrote that Ethiopia can become a developed country &quot;if it is guided by &#x27;revolutionary democracy&#x27;&quot;, adding that while &quot;liberal democracy is partial wager, a collector of rents, and a representative of the comprador bourgeoisie, &#x27;revolutionary democracy&#x27; stands for sustainable development.&quot; This marked the point at which TLPF abandoned Marxism-Leninism in favour of socialism and revolutionary ethnonationalism, moving closer to its initial position from the 1970s.

==Allegation of terrorism==
The United States government removed the TPLF&#x27;s classification as a Tier III level terrorist group when the group came to power in 1991. However, an analysis by the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) also classified it as a terrorist group dating back to 1976. According to the TRAC:

In 2021, the Ethiopia federal government passed a parliamentary resolution classifying the TPLF as a terrorist organization. According to Article 23, &quot;this decision applies to organizations and individuals that collaborate with, have links with, or are associated with the ideas and actions of the designated terrorist organizations, as well as others that have undertaken similar activities&quot;. Individuals or organizations that carry out &quot; humanitarian activities&quot;, however, are exempt under Ethiopia&#x27;s Anti-Terrorism Proclamation 1176/2020.

On November 3, 2022, the Ethiopian government and the nationalist paramilitary group entered into a peace agreement, ending their two-year conflict. A draft agreement was sent to The Associated Press stating that the TPLF will first be disarmed with their &quot;light weapons&quot; followed by the Ethiopian federal forces&#x27; retrieval of &quot;all federal facilities, installations, and major infrastructure such as airports and highways within the Tigray region.&quot;

After the signed peace agreement matured for four months, the TPLF was removed from the country&#x27;s list of terrorist group on March 22, 2023.

<doc id="1276765" wikidata="Q4970674" url="?curid=1276765" title="British Rail 18000">
<text>British Rail 18000 was a prototype mainline gas turbine–electric locomotive built for British Railways in 1949 by Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie. An earlier gas-turbine locomotive, 18100, had been ordered from Metropolitan-Vickers by the Great Western Railway but construction was delayed due to World War II; a second, 18000, was thus ordered from Switzerland in 1946. It spent its working life on the Western Region of British Railways, operating express passenger services from Paddington station, London.

== Overview ==
The GWR chose a gas-turbine locomotive because, at the time, there was no single-unit diesel locomotive of sufficient power available. The King class steam locomotive could deliver about at the rail. The LMS diesel locomotives had engines of only . After allowing for transmission losses, this would be down to about at the rail, so two diesels would be needed to match a King.

No. 18000 was of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement and its gas turbine was rated at . It had a maximum speed of and weighed . It was painted in BR black livery, with a silver stripe around the middle of the body and silver numbers.

== Technical details ==

===Gas turbine===
The gas turbine was a Brown Boveri industrial machine. It was of a type which would now be called a turboshaft engine but differed from modern free-turbine turboshaft engines in having only one turbine to drive both the compressor and the output shaft. The emphasis was on fuel economy so it had a heat exchanger (to recover waste heat from the exhaust) and was designed to run on cheap heavy fuel oil (it was also able to burn light oil but this was intended only for startup purposes). This was the same fuel that was used in oil-fired steam locomotives. After leaving the heat exchanger, the pre-heated air entered a large, vertical, combustion chamber where the fuel was injected and burned.

===Auxiliary diesel engine===
There was also an auxiliary diesel engine which provided power for starting the gas turbine. The diesel engine was capable of moving the locomotive at a slow speed when the gas turbine was not running. The usual procedure was to run the locomotive from the shed to Paddington station using the diesel engine and to start the gas turbine only a few minutes before the train was due to leave. This saved fuel and minimised annoyance from noise and exhaust fumes.

===Problems===
It proved a troublesome machine in service. Ash from the heavy fuel oil damaged the turbine blades, and the combustion chamber liner required frequent replacement due to damage. The electrical control systems were extremely complex for the time and gave much trouble; maintenance of the electrical equipment in a steam locomotive environment and knowledge base was difficult. Part way through its life one of the traction motors failed and instead of repairing or replacing it, it was simply removed, leaving the locomotive with only three traction motors and preventing it from achieving its full power output. It also suffered from the destruction of its heat exchanger in a fire at Temple Meads when combustion deposits in the exhaust side of the heat exchanger ignited.

===Fuel costs===
It was also much more expensive to run than expected. The efficiency of a gas turbine reduces dramatically at low power outputs so, to achieve respectable fuel economy, a gas turbine locomotive needs to be operated as much as possible at full power, with periods of part-load running reduced to a minimum. However, it turned out that, even on demanding express passenger schedules, it was not possible to operate the locomotive on full power for very much of the run and extended periods of part-load operation were inevitable, which resulted in heavy fuel consumption. It was also sometimes operated on the much more expensive and scarce light oil normally used only for starting, due to the level of wear caused by the ash from heavy fuel oil.

==Performance==
When reliable operation could be achieved, it did show itself capable of meeting expectations. Unfortunately, however, it was neither possible to achieve a consistently acceptable level of reliability nor to operate it under conditions which would allow reasonable fuel economy.

== Comparison of 18000 and 18100 ==
The following table gives a comparison between 18000 and 18100. There are some anomalies and these are described in the notes.

== Post-BR use ==
At the end of 1960, 18000 was withdrawn from operation and was stored at Swindon Works for four years. It then returned to mainland Europe, where for more than ten years it was used, in substantially altered (and no longer gas-turbine-powered) form, for experiments concerning the interaction between steel wheels and steel rails, under the auspices of the International Union of Railways. In 1975 it was moved to Vienna and displayed outside the Mechanical Engineering Testing building of the Arsenal research centre.

== Preservation ==
In the early 1990s it was secured for preservation. It returned to the UK and was kept at The Railway Age, Crewe. It was then moved to Barrow Hill Roundhouse and was repainted in green livery.

;Exhibited at Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway
In mid-April 2010 it was delivered to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway in order to take part (as a static exhibit) in the celebrations for the 175th birthday of the Great Western Railway from 29 May to 6 June 2010.

;Moved to Didcot Railway Centre
Since then, it has moved to Didcot. It arrived at the yard, west of Didcot Parkway railway station, on 20 July 2011 and was moved into Didcot Railway Centre on 29 July 2011. It is now owned by the Pete Waterman Trust.

== Models ==
18000 is made as a kit and ready-to-run in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models.
A further ready-to run version is planned in 2020 by Rails of Sheffield.

<doc id="1276784" wikidata="Q5354941" url="?curid=1276784" title="Elective mutism">
<text>Elective mutism is an outdated term which was defined as a refusal to speak in almost all social situations (despite normal ability to do so), while selective mutism was considered to be a &quot;failure&quot; to speak in specific situations and is strongly associated with social anxiety disorder. In contrast to selective mutism, it was thought someone who was electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and films. Elective mutism was often attributed to defiance or the effect of trauma. Those who are able to speak freely in some situations but not in others are now better described by selective mutism.

==History==
In 1877, a German physician named the disorder &quot;aphasia voluntaria&quot; to describe children who were able to speak normally but often &quot;refused&quot; to.

In 1980, a study by Torey Hayden identified four &quot;subtypes&quot; of Elective Mutism:
*Symbiotic mutism: the most common of the forms, caused by a vocal and dominating mother and absent father (very rarely the other way around) and characterized by the use of mutism as controlling behavior around other adults.
*Speech phobic mutism: the least common, in which the child showed distinct fear at hearing a recording of their voice. This also involved ritualistic behaviors, which may reflect obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and was thought to be caused by the child having been told to keep a family secret.
*Reactive mutism: a reaction to trauma and/or abuse, with all children showing symptoms of depression and being notably withdrawn, usually showing no facial expressions. Notably, Hayden admits that some children put in this category had no apparent incident to react to, but they were included because of their symptoms.
*Passive-aggressive mutism: silence is used as a display of hostility, connected to anti-social behavior. Some of the children in her study had reportedly not been mute until age 9–12.

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM), first published in 1952, first included Elective Mutism in its third edition, published in 1980. Elective mutism was described as &quot;a continuous refusal to speak in almost all social situations&quot; despite normal ability to speak. While &quot;excessive shyness&quot; and other anxiety-related traits were listed as associated features, predisposing factors included &quot;maternal overprotection&quot;, intellectual disability, and trauma. Elective mutism in the third edition revised (DSM III-R) is described similarly as in the third edition except for specifying that the disorder is &quot;not&quot; related to social anxiety disorder.

In 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM reflected the name change to selective mutism and redefined the disorder.

==Cultural references==

Though elective mutism is no longer recognized by most psychiatrists, it is a popular character element or plot point in stories and movies. Many characters choose to stop speaking, for various reasons. Even more commonly, there are also characters who stop speaking after a traumatic incident. In both these cases, often, and almost always in the second, the character is silent in all situations. This is therefore not selective mutism, and anxiety is very rarely involved. Selective mutism itself is almost nonexistent in pop culture.

The following are a few references to stories including a character who does not speak despite being physically able to:
* In the 1946 film &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot;, the heroine&#x27;s post-traumatic mutism is a major plot device.
* In the 1978 film &quot;Halloween&quot;, Michael Myers is mute after being sent to Smith&#x27;s Grove Sanitarium in the beginning of the story.
* In the season 7 episode of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; &quot;The Silent Cry&quot; (1980), one of the two brothers is depicted as an elective mute, with much of the story revolving around the issues with adopting him due to not speaking.
* In the 1982 novel &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; by Isabel Allende, Clara Trueba is mute after witnessing her sisters molestation and autopsy. &quot;She could not move until the first lights of dawn appeared. Only then did she slip back into her bed, feeling within her the silence of the entire world. Silence filled her utterly.&quot;
* In the 1984 TV film &quot;Threads&quot;, ten years after Britain is attacked in a nuclear war, surviving adults have undergone a collective elective mutism, leading to children born after the war to speak a broken form of English.
* In the 1993 film &quot;House of Cards&quot;, Sally Matthews chooses not to speak after her father dies.
* In the 1993 film &quot;The Piano&quot;, Ada is an elective mute. She chooses to learn to speak at the end of the film.
* In the 1998 novel &quot;Flying Solo&quot; by Ralph Fletcher, the character Rachel is mute for six months after a classmate dies.
* In the 2000 novel &quot;Cut&quot; by Patricia McCormick, the main character, Callie, is an elective mute.
* In the 2001 novel &quot;Ice&quot; by V. C. Andrews, a teacher of the main character, Ice, is concerned that she is an elective mute.
* In the 2006 novel &quot;&quot; by Eric Nylund, Lucy-B091 is mute after she is one of only two survivors from her unit of 300.
* In the 2006 novel &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; by Thomas Harris, Hannibal Lecter is mute after witnessing his sister killed and eaten.
* In the 2011 novel &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;, Christian Grey is depicted as having been an elective mute from age 4, when he witnessed his birth mother&#x27;s drug overdose and death and was with her body for days before being discovered, until he was 6 years old and he spoke his newly adopted baby sister&#x27;s name.
* In the 2014 video game &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;, Aiden Pearce&#x27;s nephew, Jackson, is electively mute after the death of his sister.
* In the 2014 film &quot;The Prophet&quot;, Kamila&#x27;s daughter, Elmitra, is depicted as mute after the death of her father.
* In the 2019 film &quot;A Good Woman Is Hard to Find&quot;, Ben Collins stops speaking after witnessing his father being knifed to death.

<doc id="1276799" wikidata="Q156751" url="?curid=1276799" title="Anaphora (linguistics)">
<text>In linguistics, anaphora () is the use of an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression in context (its antecedent). In a narrower sense, anaphora is the use of an expression that depends specifically upon an antecedent expression and thus is contrasted with cataphora, which is the use of an expression that depends upon a postcedent expression. The anaphoric (referring) term is called an anaphor. For example, in the sentence &quot;Sally arrived, but nobody saw her&quot;, the pronoun &quot;her&quot; is an anaphor, referring back to the antecedent &quot;Sally&quot;. In the sentence &quot;Before her arrival, nobody saw Sally&quot;, the pronoun &quot;her&quot; refers forward to the postcedent &quot;Sally&quot;, so &quot;her&quot; is now a &quot;cataphor&quot; (and an anaphor in the broader, but not the narrower, sense). Usually, an anaphoric expression is a pro-form or some other kind of deictic (contextually dependent) expression. Both anaphora and cataphora are species of endophora, referring to something mentioned elsewhere in a dialog or text.

Anaphora is an important concept for different reasons and on different levels: first, anaphora indicates how discourse is constructed and maintained; second, anaphora binds different syntactical elements together at the level of the sentence; third, anaphora presents a challenge to natural language processing in computational linguistics, since the identification of the reference can be difficult; and fourth, anaphora partially reveals how language is understood and processed, which is relevant to fields of linguistics interested in cognitive psychology.

== Nomenclature and examples ==

The term &quot;anaphora&quot; is actually used in two ways.

In a broad sense, it denotes the act of referring. Any time a given expression (e.g. a pro-form) refers to another contextual entity, anaphora is present.

In a second, narrower sense, the term &quot;anaphora&quot; denotes the act of referring backwards in a dialog or text, such as referring to the left when an anaphor points to its left toward its antecedent in languages that are written from left to right. Etymologically, &quot;anaphora&quot; derives from Ancient Greek ἀναφορά (anaphorá, &quot;a carrying back&quot;), from ἀνά (aná, &quot;up&quot;) + φέρω (phérō, &quot;I carry&quot;). In this narrow sense, anaphora stands in contrast to cataphora, which sees the act of referring forward in a dialog or text, or pointing to the right in languages that are written from left to right: Ancient Greek καταφορά (kataphorá, &quot;a downward motion&quot;), from κατά (katá, &quot;downwards&quot;) + φέρω (phérō, &quot;I carry&quot;). A pro-form is a cataphor when it points to its right toward its postcedent. Both effects together are called either anaphora (broad sense) or less ambiguously, along with self-reference they comprise the category of endophora.

Examples of anaphora (in the narrow sense) and cataphora are given next. Anaphors and cataphors appear in bold, and their antecedents and postcedents are underlined:

::Anaphora (in the narrow sense, species of endophora)

::a. Susan dropped the plate. It shattered loudly. 

::b. The music stopped, and that upset everyone. 

::c. Fred was angry, and so was I. 

::d. If Sam buys a new bike, I shall do it as well. 

::Cataphora (included in the broad sense of anaphora, species of endophora)

::a. Because he was very cold, David put on his coat. 

::b. Although Sam might do so, I shall not buy a new bike. 

::c. In their free time, the boys play video games. 

A further distinction is drawn between endophoric and exophoric reference. Exophoric reference occurs when an expression, an exophor, refers to something that is not directly present in the linguistic context, but is rather present in the situational context. Deictic pro-forms are stereotypical exophors, e.g.

::Exophora

::a. This garden hose is better than that one. 

::b. Jerry is standing over there. 

Exophors cannot be anaphors as they do not substantially refer within the dialog or text, though there is a question of what portions of a conversation or document are accessed by a listener or reader with regard to whether all references to which a term points within that language stream are noticed (i.e., if you hear only a fragment of what someone says using the pronoun &quot;her&quot;, you might never discover who &quot;she&quot; is, though if you heard the rest of what the speaker was saying on the same occasion, you might discover who &quot;she&quot; is, either by anaphoric revelation or by exophoric implication because you realize who &quot;she&quot; must be according to what else is said about &quot;her&quot; even if &quot;her&quot; identity is not explicitly mentioned, as in the case of homophoric reference).

A listener might, for example, realize through listening to other clauses and sentences that &quot;she&quot; is &quot;a Queen&quot; because of some of her attributes or actions mentioned. But which queen? Homophoric reference occurs when a generic phrase obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context. For example, the referent of the phrase &quot;the Queen&quot; (using an emphatic definite article, not the less specific &quot;a Queen&quot;, but also not the more specific &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;) must be determined by the context of the utterance, which would identify the identity of the queen in question. Until further revealed by additional contextual words, gestures, images or other media, a listener would not even know what monarchy or historical period is being discussed, and even after hearing &quot;her&quot; name is &quot;Elizabeth&quot; does not know, even if an English-UK Queen Elizabeth becomes indicated, if this queen means &quot;Queen Elizabeth I&quot; or &quot;Queen Elizabeth II&quot; and must await further clues in additional communications. Similarly, in discussing &#x27;The Mayor&#x27; (of a city), the Mayor&#x27;s identity must be understood broadly through the context which the speech references as general &#x27;object&#x27; of understanding; is a particular human person meant, a current or future or past office-holder, the office in a strict legal sense, or the office in a general sense which includes activities a mayor might conduct, might even be expected to conduct, while they may not be explicitly defined for this office.

== In generative grammar ==

The term &quot;anaphor&quot; is used in a special way in the generative grammar tradition. Here it denotes what would normally be called a reflexive or reciprocal pronoun, such as &quot;himself&quot; or &quot;each other&quot; in English, and analogous forms in other languages. The use of the term &quot;anaphor&quot; in this narrow sense is unique to generative grammar, and in particular, to the traditional binding theory. This theory investigates the syntactic relationship that can or must hold between a given pro-form and its antecedent (or postcedent). In this respect, anaphors (reflexive and reciprocal pronouns) behave very differently from, for instance, personal pronouns.

== Complement anaphora ==
In some cases, anaphora may refer not to its usual antecedent, but to its complement set. In the following example a, the anaphoric pronoun &quot;they&quot; refers to the children who are eating the ice-cream. Contrastingly, example b has &quot;they&quot; seeming to refer to the children who are not eating ice-cream:

::a. Only a few of the children ate their ice-cream. They ate the strawberry flavor first. 

::b. Only a few of the children ate their ice-cream. They threw it around the room instead. 

In its narrower definition, an anaphoric pronoun must refer to some noun (phrase) that has already been introduced into the discourse. In complement anaphora cases, however, the anaphor refers to something that is not yet present in the discourse, since the pronoun&#x27;s referent has not been formerly introduced, including the case of &#x27;everything but&#x27; what has been introduced. The set of ice-cream-eating-children in example b is introduced into the discourse, but then the pronoun &quot;they&quot; refers to the set of non-ice-cream-eating-children, a set which has not been explicitly mentioned.

Both semantic and pragmatics considerations attend this phenomenon, which following discourse representation theory since the early 1980s, such as work by Kamp (1981) and Heim (File Change Semantics, 1982), and generalized quantifier theory, such as work by Barwise and Cooper (1981), was studied in a series of psycholinguistic experiments in the early 1990s by Moxey and Sanford (1993) and Sanford et al. (1994). In complement anaphora as in the case of the pronoun in example b, this anaphora refers to some sort of complement set (i.e. only to the set of non-ice-cream-eating-children) or to the maximal set (i.e. to all the children, both ice-cream-eating-children and non-ice-cream-eating-children) or some hybrid or variant set, including potentially one of those noted to the right of example b. The various possible referents in complement anaphora are discussed by Corblin (1996), Kibble (1997), and Nouwen (2003). Resolving complement anaphora is of interest in shedding light on brain access to information, calculation, mental modeling, communication.

== Anaphora resolution – centering theory ==
There are many theories that attempt to prove how anaphors are related and trace back to their antecedents, with centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) being one of them. Taking the computational theory of mind view of language, centering theory gives a computational analysis of underlying antecedents. In their original theory, Grosz, Joshi, &amp; Weinstein (1983) propose that some discourse entities in utterances are more &quot;central&quot; than others, and this degree of centrality imposes constraints on what can be the antecedent.

In the theory, there are different types of centers: forward facing, backwards facing, and preferred.

=== Forward facing centers ===

A ranked list of discourse entities in an utterance. The ranking is debated, some focusing on theta relations (Yıldırım et al. 2004) and some providing definitive lists.

=== Backwards facing center ===

The highest ranked discourse entity in the previous utterance.

=== Preferred center ===

The highest ranked discourse entity in the previous utterance realised in the current utterance.

<text>Class 80 was the TOPS classification allocated by British Rail to the prototype 25 kV AC electric locomotive. This locomotive was built by Metropolitan-Vickers, initially as a prototype gas turbine–electric locomotive, numbered 18100. British Rail allocated the number E1000 (and later E2001) to the locomotive following its conversion from gas turbine propulsion.

==Conversion==

Its new electric propulsion meant it was rated at , giving a maximum speed of and weighing . In addition, it was also converted from Co-Co to A1A-A1A wheel arrangement when the centre traction motor from each bogie was removed. The new traction motor rating (with four motors) was about the same as the original rating (with six motors). This suggests that new traction motors were fitted.

The conversion of the locomotive began in January 1958 when the locomotive was moved from storage at Dukinfield Works to the Bowesfield Works at Stockton-on-Tees. The work involved the removal of the gas turbine unit, main generator, fuel tank, air filters, the centre traction motor from each bogie and all of the ancillary equipment used for the gas turbine unit.

Once the locomotive had been stripped, the new electrical equipment was installed which included the transformer, the Stone-Faiveley pantograph (for which a section of the roof had to be lowered), a Brown Boveri air blast circuit breaker and the Hackbridge-Hewittic mercury arc rectifier units.

The cabs of the locomotive were converted from Western Region right-hand drive to the standard British Rail left-hand drive arrangement. The rebuilt locomotive was completed and ready for trials in October 1958. It retained its original BR black livery, with a silver stripe around the middle of the body and silver numbers.

==Usage==
The locomotive was used to prepare the ground for the 25 kV AC electrification being installed on the West Coast Main Line, including the testing of overhead line equipment and staff training.

==Withdrawal==

Once the production locomotives (Class 81 onwards) were in service, E2001 was no longer required. It was put into store at the end of 1961, and lasted for over ten years at various locations. It was officially withdrawn in April 1968 and scrapped in November 1972 at J Cashmore in Great Bridge.

== Models ==
E1000/E2001 is being made as a kit and a ready-to-run model in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models.

<doc id="1276817" wikidata="Q673154" url="?curid=1276817" title="Cervelat">
<text>Cervelat, also cervelas, servelat or zervelat, is a sausage produced in Switzerland, France (especially Alsace and Lyon), Belgium, the Netherlands and parts of Germany. The recipe and preparation of the sausage vary regionally.

The sausages are spelled &quot;cervelas&quot; in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, &quot;Cervelat&quot; in the German-speaking part, and &quot;servelat&quot; in the Italian-speaking part. The terms ultimately derive from &quot;cerebrum&quot;, the Latin word for brain, which was used in early recipes. The term &quot;Cervelat&quot; is the oldest of the three. It was first recorded in 1552 by Rabelais, and is derived from &quot;zervelada&quot;, a Milanese word meaning a &quot;large, short sausage filled with meat and pork brains.&quot; Modern recipes do not include brains, and arose towards the end of the 19th century in Basel, as a reworking of the traditional recipe. In Germany, the sausage is sometimes also called &quot;Lyoner&quot; which comes from its perceived origin. In the federal state of Saarland the &quot;Lyoner&quot; sausage is even considered a regional staple dish.

The taste of the sausages depends on the region, but generally they are similar to that of a frankfurter, but with a smokier flavour and a texture brought about by its fat shape and the tightly wrapped natural casing. Various European semi-dry cervelat are similar to summer sausage in the U.S., and Thuringian sausage can be considered a type of cervelat. In the United States, the term &quot;Thuringer sausage&quot; is used for a type of cervelat, rather than Thuringian sausage in the European sense.

==Switzerland==

In Switzerland, cervelats are cooked (slightly smoked and then boiled) or served &quot;raw&quot; (cold, having been cooked during initial manufacture). They contain a mixture of beef, bacon and pork rind. The modern Swiss variety is packed into zebu intestines.

The cervelat is often referred to as the national sausage of Switzerland. Some 160 million cervelats weighing 27,000 metric tons are produced in Switzerland annually, which is equivalent to a consumption of 25 sausages per person each year. Grilling cervelats over an open fire with the ends cut open so they expand like a butterfly&#x27;s wings is a childhood memory for nearly every Swiss person; as a result, many Swiss are emotionally attached to the sausage. Swiss cervelats are made of roughly equal parts of beef, pork, bacon, pork rind and ice, which helps bind the ingredients, along with spices, curing salt and cutter additives. The ingredients are finely minced in a cutter, packed into beef intestines, smoked for an hour and then cooked by boiling for a short time. Processed and packaged varieties sold in Swiss supermarkets also contain nitrites and antioxidants. A cervelat may weigh from about 100 to 200 grams.

Swiss cervelats are prepared and eaten cooked or raw. They are boiled, grilled or fried. They can also be served uncooked, either in a salad or with bread and mustard.

Sometimes sold smoked and uncooked, cervelat can be seasoned, salted and cold smoked for one day.

===2008 casings shortage===
Traditionally, Swiss beef intestines were used for the casings, but towards the end of the 20th century, local cattle producers lost interest in cleaning and preparing them, so meat processors switched to Brazilian zebu intestines, which are not fatty and do not easily split open when roasted. However, beginning on 1 April 2006, the European Union banned the import of many animal parts from Brazil as a measure aimed at preventing the spread of mad cow disease. Among these were beef intestines. Although Switzerland is not an EU member state, it is bound to observe European food protection laws through other treaty agreements. Hence, Swiss and German stockpiles of zebu intestines became very low by 2008, threatening production altogether, and causing some controversy in Switzerland. In January of that year, the Swiss meat industry announced that a national &quot;cervelat task force&quot; had failed in an exhaustive search for an acceptable alternative to zebu intestines.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;the possible demise of cervelas visibly upset the Swiss, a normally even-tempered people.&quot; The cervelat production crisis was covered closely by the Swiss media and in a newspaper poll, 72% of those surveyed said the &quot;&quot;cervelas&quot;, as they knew it, had to be saved.&quot; The cervelat crisis was brought up in a parliamentary debate wherein state councillor and president of the Swiss Meat Association, Rolf Büttiker, spoke of the national sausage&#x27;s social significance, calling it a &quot;cult sausage&quot; and &quot;the worker&#x27;s steak&quot;. The Swiss government entered into negotiations with the EU to seek an exception for zebu intestines, and Swiss scientists were sent to Brazil hoping to show that the intestines posed no risk of transmitting mad cow disease.

By August 2008, most of the Swiss demand for bovine intestines had been met with imports from Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay.

==France==
Cervelas de Lyon are a sausage specialty of Lyonnaise cuisine. They contain finely minced pork, and either truffles or pistachios. Sold uncooked, the sausage has to be boiled before it is eaten.

In Alsatian cuisine, &quot;cervelas d&#x27;Alsace&quot; are split open and served with cheese (gruyère) and bacon.

Born in 1907 in the Governorate of Estonia of the Russian Empire, he emigrated to the United States at an early age. He graduated from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1929. As a lawyer, Shapiro practiced in Kankakee, Illinois. Turning to public service, he was elected state&#x27;s attorney (county prosecutor) of Kankakee County in 1936. From 1947–1961 he served in the Illinois State House of Representatives, where he took a special interest in mental health issues.

Shapiro was elected the 38th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 1960 and again in 1964, and took office as governor when the previous governor Otto Kerner, Jr. resigned to accept appointment to the federal appellate court. Shapiro thus became the second Jewish governor of Illinois (Henry Horner being the first). Illinois thereby became the first state to have had two Jewish governors; New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have each since elected at least a second governor of the faith.

Upon becoming governor, Shapiro ran at once for a full term of his own but was narrowly defeated by Republican Richard B. Ogilvie in the 1968 election. He then returned to private life, although he was called upon several times to serve on special commissions, the most significant of which was a commission to redraw state electoral boundaries in 1981.

Shapiro was an alumnus of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. From 1984 until his death, he led the effort to establish a permanent headquarters for the fraternity&#x27;s national offices. As a result, Alpha Epsilon Pi&#x27;s International Headquarters is dedicated in his honor.

Shapiro continued to work as an attorney; his death was discovered when he failed to appear in court for a client and police were sent to his home in Kankakee to investigate. He is buried in Jewish Waldheim Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois. The state renamed the Kankakee Mental Health Center in his honor.

<text>The Professional Footballers&#x27; Association Men&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year (often called the PFA Men&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year, the Players&#x27; Player of the Year, or simply the Player of the Year) is an annual award given to the player who is adjudged to have been the best of the year in English football. The award has been presented since the 1973–74 season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the players&#x27; trade union, the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA). The current holder is Phil Foden of Manchester City, who won the award for the first time on 20 August 2024.

The first winner of the award was Leeds United defender Norman Hunter. As of 2024, only Mark Hughes, Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Kevin De Bruyne and Mohamed Salah have won the award on two occasions, and only Henry, Ronaldo and De Bruyne have won the award in consecutive seasons. Of the seven, only Shearer won his two awards playing for different teams. Although there is a separate PFA Young Player of the Year award, young players remain eligible to win the senior award, and on three occasions the same player has won both awards for a season, Andy Gray in 1976–77, Ronaldo in 2006–07 and Bale in 2012–13. Only three non-European players have won the award: Luis Suárez (Uruguay) in 2013–14, Riyad Mahrez (Algeria) in 2015–16, and Mohamed Salah (Egypt) in 2017–18 and 2021–22.

Every spring, each member of the association votes for two players. A shortlist of nominees is published in April and the winner of the award, along with the winners of the PFA&#x27;s other annual awards, is announced at a gala event in London. The award is regarded by the players themselves as extremely prestigious, with Teddy Sheringham describing it in 2001 as &quot;the biggest personal award you can get in the game&quot;, and John Terry stating in 2005 that he considered it &quot;the ultimate accolade to be voted for by your fellow professionals whom you play against week-in and week-out&quot;.

==Winners==
The award has been presented on 51 occasions as of 2024, with 44 different winners. The women&#x27;s award has been presented since 2013, with nine different winners. The table also indicates where the winning player also won one or more of the other major &quot;player of the year&quot; awards in English football, namely the Football Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Footballer of the Year award (FWA), the PFA Fans&#x27; Player of the Year award (FPY), the PFA Young Player of the Year award (YPY), the Premier League Player of the Season award (PPS), the Premier League Young Player of the Season award (PYS) and the Football Supporters’ Federation Player of the Year award (FSF).

<doc id="1276826" wikidata="Q883416" url="?curid=1276826" title="Oi! Warning">
<text>Oi! Warning is a 2000 German movie about a 17-year-old boy who runs away from home to become an Oi! skinhead.

The movie was the directorial debut of twin brothers Benjamin and Dominik Reding. It took them about five years to film, mostly due to financial constraints. It was shot in stark black-and-white, underscoring the film&#x27;s gritty feel. Among other recognitions, the film has won the German Camera Award, and a L.A. Outfest &quot;emerging talent&quot; award.

==Plot summary==
Janosch has problems at school and despises the lifestyle of his bourgeois mother. He runs away from home, to his friend Koma, who he had met at a holiday camp. Koma is an Oi! skinhead (also known as a punk-skinhead). He is a particular sort of skinhead who has little political motivations, preferring a lifestyle of partying and binge drinking, and whose musical tastes are a synthesis of skinhead and punk rock music.

Koma&#x27;s girlfriend is pregnant, and wants him to change his ways. She blows up his secret hideaway with dynamite, but this only infuriates Koma, who blames this on the punks he had gotten into a fight with previously.

Meanwhile, Janosch meets Zottel, a punk who earns a living with small circus acts at wealthy people&#x27;s parties. The two fall in love, but their happiness is cut short when Koma attacks Zottel and kills him. In a fit of fury, Janosch grabs a brick and slays Koma.

==Cast list==
* Sascha Backhaus as Janosch. Backhaus portrays the main protagonist Janosch, who escapes his pampered bourgeois lifestyle to become an Oi-skinhead, but later questions the ultra-masculine, testosterone-fueled subculture. Backhaus himself was a real-life squatter.
* Sascha Goerts as Koma. Goerts plays the tough Koma, a hard drinking, kickboxing and often violent Oi-skinhead, who takes Janosch under his wing. Like Backhaus, Goerts was a squatter, and also an occasional street musician. According to the DVD commentary, he gave such a convincing performance that people were shocked when they found out that Goerts is in fact a soft-spoken, intelligent person.
* Sandra Borgmann as Sandra. Borgmann portrays Sandra, Komas skin-girl girlfriend. She later becomes the mother of his twins and grows fed up of his Oi-behaviour. In contrast to Backhaus and Goerts, Borgmann was already an established actress.
* Jens Veith as Zottel. A punk with whom Janosch later has an affair. Veith is a real-life fire-eater and juggler and was one of the last actors cast for the movie.

==Development==
When they started the project, the Reding brothers wanted to authentically portray youths from fringe subcultures like &quot;skinheads (non-political Oi!skins), squatters, modern-primitives and tribes ... who all just do what they like ... Their own way of fun, fights, sorrows and desires. What we didn&#x27;t want to do was: showing stereotypes of youth-culture, like the drug-abusing &quot;problemchild&quot; or the sexually overpowered &quot;teenager&quot; we all know so well from television.&quot; According to them, they then drew a 600-picture storyboard and started choosing actors.

When casting the movie, the Reding brothers looked for people who were &quot;absolutely, 100% believable on the big screen ... This is the reason why the actresses and actors in OI!WARNING are a good mixture of non-professionals and professionals&quot;: male leads Sascha Backhaus and Simon Goerts were non-professionals, whilst female lead Sandra Borgmann was an established actress when the project started. A problem was money, because the &quot;Oi! Warning&quot; production was very low budget. It took over five years to complete, because the Reding brothers frequently had to stop filming until they had earned enough money to continue.

In the film, there is a concert in which the fictional Oi-group &quot;Roimkommando&quot; (the real life punk band &quot;Smegma&quot;) holds a concert, to which Oi-skins led by Koma (Goerts) violently mosh to. On the DVD commentary track, the Redings explain that they could not use the sexually charged word &quot;Smegma&quot; in a film which was meant to be seen by teenagers, so they had to change the name of the band. In addition, all the Oi skinhead extras were real Oi skinheads, who demanded beer as compensation when they slowly grew weary of filming. In addition, they moshed so hard that Goerts was often knocked out of the middle and the scene had to be reshot.

==Awards==
&quot;Oi! Warning&quot; won following prizes:

*Out-Filmfest, Los Angeles: Outstanding Emerging Talent-Award of the Directors Guild of America 1999
*World Filmfestival, Montréal: Air Canada People Award 1999
*International Filmfestival, Leeds: Audience-Award 1999
*Max Ophüls Filmfestival, Saarbrücken: Film-Award of the Governour of the Saarland 1999
*Film Kunst Fest, Schwerin: NDR Young Talent Award 1999
*International Festival du premiere Film, Annonay (France ): Prix Spécial du Jury 2000

<doc id="1276830" wikidata="Q61310" url="?curid=1276830" title="Paul de Lagarde">
<text>Paul Anton de Lagarde (2 November 1827 – 22 December 1891) was a German biblical scholar and orientalist, sometimes regarded as one of the greatest orientalists of the 19th century. Lagarde&#x27;s anti-Semitism, anti-Slavism, and aversion to traditional Christianity are viewed as having been among the most influential precursors of Nazism.

==Life &amp; Career==
Paul Bötticher was born in Berlin to Johann Friedrich Wilhelm and Luise Bötticher. His father was a philologist who taught languages at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium. 18-year old Luise died days after Paul was born. A bereft Wilhelm blamed his newborn son for the loss and treated him miserably. His woeful upbringing led him to feel nothing upon his father&#x27;s death. Two maternal aunts nurtured Paul emotionally and financially. Ernestine de Lagarde was Luise&#x27;s aunt, and she eventually adopted Paul. 

Bötticher attended Humboldt University of Berlin from 1844–6 where he studied Oriental languages, theology, and philosophy under professors like Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg, who was a friend of his father. His primary mentor was Friedrich Rückert. He attended the University of Halle-Wittenberg from 1846–7. 

In 1852, Bötticher received a 1,000 thaler grant from King Frederick William IV to study abroad. He used it to travel to London to work at the British Museum. On his way home in January 1853, Bötticher stayed in Paris to work in the Bibliothèque nationale. He relied on Ernest Renan to check out manuscripts for him. The Syriac texts he studied while abroad led to the publication of &quot;Didascalia apostolorum syriace&quot; in 1854. 

That year, Bötticher married Anna Berger. He also decided to change his name to honor his mother&#x27;s family and to move past his painful childhood. He had already published several volumes under his birth name. 

In 1855, Paul de Lagarde taught languages at Köllnisches Gymnasium in Berlin where his duties included teaching gymnastics. He continued to publish scholarly work, much of it at his own expense. In 1858, he transferred to the Friedrichswerdersches Gymnasium. In 1866, he was given three years leave for research. In 1869, he took over Heinrich Ewald&#x27;s professorship of oriental languages at the University of Göttingen. 

The decade it took to become a professor deepened the bitterness Lagarde already felt over his childhood. He was dogmatic and distrustful of others. Lagarde shunned professional affiliations and frequently attacked colleagues and peers. In a letter to Adolf Hilgenfeld, Lagarde described himself as an &quot;anchorite&quot;, simultaneously lamenting and imposing his self-isolation.

Lagarde was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1891 and kept the diagnosis secret. He had an operation to treat it on December 19. It was unsuccessful, and he died three days later. His own eulogist, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, described Lagarde as a lonely man who sowed the wind and reaped the storm.

==Scholarship==
Paul de Lagarde wrote on a broad range of topics, moving fluidly between multiple languages. His main focus was elucidation of the Bible.

Wilhelm Bötticher was also a prolific scholar, and Lagarde loathed the assembly-line nature of his father&#x27;s writing. Ironically, he would be similarly overproductive, writing many works that were underbaked. A bibliography of his work was prepared in 1892, and it ran to eighteen pages.

Lagarde edited the Aramaic translation (known as the Targum) of the Prophets according to the Codex Reuchlinianus preserved at Karlsruhe, &quot;Prophetae chaldaice&quot; (1872), the &quot;Hagiographa chaldaice&quot; (1874), an Arabic translation of the Gospels, &quot;Die vier Evangelien, arabisch aus der Wiener Handschrift herausgegeben&quot; (1864), a Syriac translation of the Old Testament Apocrypha, &quot;Libri V. T. apocryphi syriace&quot; (1865), a Coptic translation of the Pentateuch, &quot;Der Pentateuch koptisch&quot; (1867), and a part of the Lucianic text of the Septuagint, which he was able to reconstruct from manuscripts for nearly half the Old Testament.

He was also a student of Persian, publishing &quot;Isaias persice&quot; (1883) and &quot;Persische Studien&quot; (1884). In 1880, de Lagarde attempted to reconstruct a Syriac version of Epiphanius&#x27; treatise, &quot;On Weights and Measures&quot;, which he entitled, &quot;Veteris Testamenti ab Origene recensiti fragmenta apud Syros servata quinque. Praemittitur Epiphanii de mensuris et ponderibus liber nunc primum integer et ipse syriacus&quot; (Gootingae 1880). He followed up his Coptic studies with &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (1883), and published many minor contributions to the study of oriental languages in &quot;Gesammelte Abhandlungen&quot; (1866), &quot;Symmicta&quot; (1. 1877, ii. 1880), &quot;Semitica&quot; (i. 1878, ii. 1879), &quot;Orientalia&quot; (1879–1880) and &quot;Mittheilungen&quot; (1884). Mention should also be made of the valuable &quot;Onomastica sacra&quot; (1870; 2nd ed., 1887).

==Political writing==
Lagarde was a member of the Prussian Conservative Party until 1849 when it fabricated evidence of treason against Benedikt Waldeck. He became deeply disenchanted and politically unaligned. In his mid-40s, Lagarde began to write cultural criticism and gave occasional speeches. He eventually collected his essays in &quot;Deutsche Schriften&quot; (German Literature, 1878–1881). 

He postulated a national religion in his first political treatise &quot;Über das Verhältnis des deutschen Staates zu Theologie, Kirche und Religion.&quot; (On the Relationship of the German State to Theology, Church and Religion). He felt the state&#x27;s most important task was to create a climate in which this national religion could flourish. Meanwhile, he obliged those who had faith in God to a radical morality wherein they distinguish solely between &quot;duty or sin&quot; in their every action. In addition, first a formal language must be developed for the religiosity of these newborn men. 

He concludes his 1875 book, &quot;Über die gegenwärtige Lage des deutschen Reichs&quot; (On the Current Situation of the German Reich):

Lagarde despised the bland version of Christianity that he knew and dreamed of a nationalistic religion. He was conversant with Adolf Stoecker, the founder of the anti-Semitic Berlin Movement. He also showed interest in folkish-anti-Semitic societies such as the &quot;Deutscher Volksverein&quot; of Bernhard Förster and Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg, as well as the &quot;Deutschsoziale Partei&quot; of Theodor Fritsch. To the latter, he established contact in 1886 by sending his treatise &quot;Die nächsten Pflichten deutscher Politik&quot; (The Coming Tasks of German Politics), at the core of which he considered to be a German policy of settlement in Eastern Europe.

He considered Jews to be the greatest barrier to German unification, whereas he simultaneously avowed the concept of a German colonization of southeastern Europe and proposed that the Jewish population settled there at the time be resettled to Palestine or Madagascar. The only alternatives for Lagarde were the total assimilation or emigration of the Jews. He also despised Slavs and wrote, &quot;the sooner they perish the better it will be for us and them&quot;.

In his 1887 essay &quot;Jews and Indo-Germanics&quot;, he wrote: “One would have to have a heart of steel to not feel sympathy for the poor Germans and, by the same token, to not hate the Jews, to not hate and despise those who – out of humanity! – advocate for the Jews or are too cowardly to crush these vermin. Trichinella and bacilli would not be negotiated with, trichinella and bacilli would also not be nurtured, they would be destroyed as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.&quot;

In addition to his influence on anti-Semitism and anti-slavism, Lagarde is also of importance to the formation of German imperialist thought. In this regard, he concentrated on German border colonization within Europe rather than the acquisition of overseas colonies. This bears a close resemblance to the later concept of German &quot;Lebensraum&quot; most notably espoused by Friedrich Ratzel. In 1875, Lagarde maintained that the primary objective of German politics was the &quot;gradual Germanization of Poland.&quot; Since he was concerned about how many Germans emigrated in their search for land, he advocated a border colonizing land acquisition for the peasantry, which he considered the &quot;true foundation of the state.&quot; This land acquisition aimed to create a &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; under German leadership &quot;that reaches from the Ems to the mouth of the Danube, from the Neman to Trieste, from Metz to about the Bug.&quot;

==Legacy==
Lagarde was the most renowned Septuagint scholar of the nineteenth century. A 1920 handbook of Septuagint studies concluded that Lagarde&#x27;s work set the modern standard for the field. Shortly after his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Lagarde as &quot;the most remarkable writer on Semitic studies that the world has ever known&quot;. Lagarde bequeathed his library to the Royal Society of Sciences in Göttingen. When John Dyneley Prince was alerted that it was for sale and would immediately bestow the owner with the best Oriental library in America, he arranged for New York University to purchase it for $7,000 in 1893.

In 1894, Lagarde&#x27;s wife Anna published many of his letters in a memoir of her husband.

&quot;Deutsche Schriften&quot; was widely read by figures like Thomas Mann and Theodor Heuss. In his 1918 book, &quot;The New Europe&quot;, Tomáš Masaryk regards Lagarde as one of the leading philosophical and theological spokesmen of Pan-Germanism, and furthermore describes Heinrich von Treitschke as its historian, Wilhelm II as its politician and Friedrich Ratzel as its geopolitical geographer. In all of them he saw the representatives of the imperialistic &quot;German &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot;&quot; that threatened the Slavic countries.

Nazi theorist Alfred Rosenberg was heavily influenced by Lagarde&#x27;s writings. Rosenberg&#x27;s notion of positive Christianity directly descended from Lagarde. 

Fritz Stern zeroed in on the aimless nature of Lagarde&#x27;s political writings:&quot;He wrote as a prophet; he neither reasoned nor exposited, but poured out his excoriations and laments, his intuitive truths and promises. There was nothing limpid or systematic in his work; within each essay he skipped from subject to subject, alternating abstract generalities and concrete proposals. The pervasive mood of the book was despair and the dominant tone a kind of whiny heroism.&quot;

<doc id="1276833" wikidata="Q5378616" url="?curid=1276833" title="English personal pronouns">
<text>The English [[personal pronouns]] are a subset of English pronouns taking various forms according to number, person, case and grammatical gender. Modern English has very little inflection of nouns or adjectives, to the point where some authors describe it as an analytic language, but the Modern English system of personal pronouns has preserved some of the inflectional complexity of Old English and Middle English.

==Forms==
Unlike nouns which are not inflected for case except for possession (&quot;woman/woman&#x27;s&quot;), English personal pronouns have a number of forms, which are named according to their typical grammatical role in a sentence:
* objective (accusative) case (&quot;me&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, etc.), used as the object of a verb, complement of a preposition, and the subject of a verb in some constructions (see below). The same forms are also used as disjunctive pronouns.
* subjective (nominative) case (&quot;I&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, etc.), used as the subject of a verb (see also below).
* reflexive form (&quot;myself&quot;, &quot;ourselves&quot;, etc.). This typically refers back to a noun or pronoun (its antecedent) within the same clause (for example, &quot;She cut herself&quot;). This form is also sometimes used optionally in a non-reflexive function, as a substitute for a non-reflexive pronoun (for example, &quot;For someone like myself, . . .&quot;, &quot;This article was written by Professor Smith and myself&quot;), though some style guides recommend avoiding such use. The same reflexive forms also are used as intensive pronouns (for example, &quot;She made the dress herself&quot;).
Possessive pronouns (&quot;mine&quot;, &quot;ours&quot;, etc.) replace the entity that was referred to previously (as in &quot;I prefer mine&quot;) or serve as predicate adjectives (as in &quot;this book is mine&quot;). For details see English possessive. As they are pronouns they cannot precede any noun.

===Basic===

The basic personal pronouns of modern English are shown in the table below.
Other English pronouns which have distinct forms of the above types are the indefinite pronoun &quot;one&quot;, which has the reflexive &quot;oneself&quot; (the possessive form is written &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;, like a regular English possessive); and the interrogative and relative pronoun &quot;who&quot;, which has the objective form &quot;whom&quot; (now confined mostly to formal English) and the possessive &quot;whose&quot; (which in its relative use can also serve as the possessive for &quot;which&quot;).

Note that singular they is morphosyntactically plural: it is used with a plural verb form, as in &quot;they laugh&quot; or &quot;they are&quot;. See the singular they section for more information.

===Archaic and non-standard===

Apart from the standard forms given above, English also has a number of non-standard, informal and archaic forms of personal pronouns.
* An archaic set of second-person singular pronouns is thou, thee, thy, thine, thyself. In Anglo-Saxon times, these were strictly second person singular. After the Norman Conquest in 1066, they began to be used as a familiar form, like French &quot;tu&quot; and German &quot;du&quot;. They passed out of general use between 1600 and 1800, although they (or variants of them) survive in some English and Scottish dialects and in some Christian religious communities, and in many idioms. For details see &quot;thou&quot;.
* In archaic language, mine and thine may be used in place of &quot;my&quot; and &quot;thy&quot; when followed by a vowel sound.
* For the use of &quot;me&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot;, see 
* An archaic form of plural &quot;you&quot; as a subject pronoun is ye. Some dialects now use &quot;ye&quot; in place of &quot;you&quot;, or as an apocopated or clitic form of &quot;you&quot;. See &quot;ye&quot; (pronoun).
* A non-standard variant of &quot;my&quot; (particularly in British dialects) is me. (This may have its origins in the fact that in Middle English &quot;my&quot; before a consonant was pronounced [mi:], like modern English &quot;me&quot;, (while &quot;me&quot; was [me:], similar to modern &quot;may&quot;) and this was shortened to [mi] or [mɪ], as the pronouns &quot;he&quot; and &quot;we&quot; are nowadays; [hi wɒz] &quot;he was&quot;; versus [ɪt wɒz hi:] &quot;it was he&quot;. As this vowel was short, it was not subject to the Great Vowel Shift, and so emerged in modern English unchanged.)
* Informal second-person plural forms (particularly in North American dialects) include you all, y&#x27;all, youse. Other variants include: &quot;yous&quot;, &quot;you/youse guys&quot;, &quot;you/youse gals&quot;, &quot;you-uns&quot;, &quot;yis&quot;, &quot;yinz&quot;. Possessives may include &quot;you(r) guys&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;you(r) gals&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;yous&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;y&#x27;all&#x27;s&quot; (or &quot;y&#x27;alls&quot;). Reflexives may be formed by adding &quot;selves&quot; after any of the possessive forms. See &quot;y&#x27;all&quot;, &quot;yinz&quot;, &quot;yous&quot;. &quot;Yous&quot; is common in Scotland, particularly in the Central Belt area (though in some parts of the country and in parts of Ireland, &quot;ye&quot; is used for the plural &quot;you&quot;).
* In informal speech &quot;them&quot; is often replaced by &#x27;em, believed to be a survival of the late Old English form &quot;heom&quot;, which appears as &quot;hem&quot; in Chaucer, losing its aspiration due to being used as an unstressed form. (The forms &quot;they&quot;, &quot;them&quot; etc. are of Scandinavian origin.)
* Non-standard reflexive forms ourself and themself are sometimes used in contexts where &quot;we&quot; and &quot;they&quot; are used with singular meaning (see &quot;we&quot; and singular &quot;they&quot;).
* Non-standard reflexive forms hisself and theirselves/theirself are sometimes used (though would be considered incorrect in standard English).
* In some parts of England, the pronoun &quot;hoo&quot; is used as a third person singular pronoun. The exact usage varies by location, as it can refer to a male creature, female creature, or be used as a genderless pronoun depending on where in England it is used.

===Complete table===
A more complete table, including the standard forms and some of the above forms, is given below. Nonstandard, informal and archaic forms are in &quot;italics&quot;.

For further archaic forms, and information on the evolution of the personal pronouns of English, see Old English pronouns.

==Generic &quot;you&quot;==

The pronoun &quot;you&quot; (and its other forms) can be used as a generic or indefinite pronoun, referring to a person in general. A more formal equivalent is the indefinite pronoun &quot;one&quot; (reflexive &quot;oneself&quot;, possessive &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;). For example, &quot;you should keep your secrets to yourself&quot; may be used in place of the more formal &quot;one should keep one&#x27;s secrets to oneself&quot;.

==Gender==

=== Use of &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; and &quot;it&quot; ===

The masculine pronouns, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, and &quot;his&quot; are used to refer to male persons. The feminine pronouns &quot;she&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, and &quot;hers&quot; are used to refer to female persons. &quot;It&quot; and &quot;its&quot; are normally used to refer to an inanimate object or abstract concept; however, babies and young children may sometimes be referred to as &quot;it&quot; (e.g. &quot;a child needs its mother&quot;). Outside of these very limited contexts, use of &quot;it&quot; as a pronoun for people is generally avoided, due to the feeling that it is dehumanizing.

Traditionally, in English, if the gender of a person was not known or ambiguous, then the masculine pronouns were often used by default (e.g. &quot;a good student always does his homework&quot;). Increasingly, though, singular &quot;they&quot; is used in such cases (see below).

Animals are often referred to as &quot;it&quot;, but &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; are sometimes used for animals when the animal&#x27;s sex is known and is of interest, particularly for higher animals, especially pets and other domesticated animals. Inanimate objects with which humans have a close relationship, such as ships, cars and countries considered as political, rather than geographical, entities, are sometimes referred to using feminine pronouns such as &quot;she&quot; and &quot;her&quot;. This may also be extended to other entities, such as towns.

=== Singular &quot;they&quot; ===

The singular &quot;they&quot; emerged by the 14th century, about a century after the plural &quot;they&quot;. Even when used with singular meaning, &quot;they&quot; takes a plural verb: &quot;If attacked, the victim should remain exactly where they are.&quot; Due to this supposed grammatical inconsistency, use of singular &quot;they&quot; was discouraged by some grammarians during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in favor of using generic &quot;he&quot;. Since the 1970s, however, this trend has reversed, and singular &quot;they&quot; now enjoys widespread acceptance.

In the early 21st century, use of singular &quot;they&quot; with known individuals emerged for some non-binary people, or when the sex or social gender of a person is unknown or unspecified. This is a way of producing gender-neutral language while avoiding other pronouns like &quot;he or she&quot;, &quot;he/she&quot;, or &quot;s/he&quot;.

=== Gender agreement of genitives ===
In English, genitive pronouns agree with the gender of the antecedent or referent. This is in contrast to many languages in which such pronouns agree with the gender of the head noun of the NP in which they appear. For example, in &quot;She saw her brother&quot;, the genitive pronoun &quot;her&quot; agrees with antecedent &quot;she&quot;. Both are feminine. In Italian, in contrast, the same sentences is &quot;Lei ha visto suo fratello&quot;. Here &quot;suo&quot; is a third-person, singular, masculine genitive pronoun. It agrees with &quot;fratello&quot; (brother), not with the feminine antecedent &quot;lei&quot;.

==Case usage==
As noted above, most of the personal pronouns have distinct case forms – a subjective (nominative) form and an objective (oblique, accusative) form. In certain instances variation arises in the use of these forms.

As a general rule, the subjective form is used when the pronoun is the subject of a verb, as in he kicked the ball&quot;, whereas the objective form is used as the direct or indirect object of a verb, or the object (complement) of a preposition. For example: &quot;Sue kicked him, &quot;someone gave him the ball&quot;, &quot;Mary was with him&quot;.

When used as a predicative expression, i.e. as the complement of a form of the copula verb &quot;be&quot;, the subjective form was traditionally regarded as more correct (as in &quot;this is I, &quot;it was he), but nowadays the objective form is used predominantly (&quot;this is me, &quot;it was him), and the use of the subjective in such instances is normally regarded as very formal or pedantic; it is more likely (in formal English) when followed by a relative clause (&quot;it is we who sent them to die&quot;). In some cases the subjective may even appear ungrammatical, as in *&quot;is that we in the photograph?&quot; (where us would be expected).

When a pronoun is linked to other nouns or pronouns by a coordinating conjunction such as &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot;, traditional grammar prescribes that the pronoun should appear in the same form as it would take if it were used alone in the same position: &quot;Jay and I will arrive later&quot; (since &quot;I&quot; is used for the subject of a verb), but &quot;between you and me&quot; (since &quot;me&quot; is used for the object of a preposition). However, in informal and less careful usage this rule may not be consistently followed; it is common to hear &quot;Jay and me will arrive...&quot; and &quot;between you and I&quot;. The latter type (use of the subjective form in object position) is seen as an example of hypercorrection, resulting from an awareness that many instances of &quot;and me&quot; (like that in the first example) are considered to require correction to &quot;and I&quot;.

Similar deviations from the grammatical norm are quite common in other examples where the pronoun does not stand alone as the subject or object, as in &quot;Who said us Yorkshiremen&quot; [grammatical: &quot;we Yorkshiremen&quot;] &quot;are tight?&quot;

When a pronoun stands alone without an explicit verb or preposition, the objective form is commonly used, even when traditional grammarians might prefer the subjective: &quot;Who&#x27;s sitting here? Me.&quot; (Here &quot;I&quot; might be regarded as grammatically correct, since it is short for &quot;I am (sitting here)&quot;, but it would sound formal and pedantic, unless followed by &quot;am&quot;.)

A particular case of this type occurs when a pronoun stands alone following the word &quot;than&quot;. Here the objective form is again predominant in informal usage (&quot;they are older than us), as would be expected if &quot;than&quot; were analyzed as a preposition. However traditionally &quot;than&quot; is considered a conjunction, and so in formal and grammatically careful English the pronoun often takes the form that would appear if &quot;than&quot; were followed by a clause: &quot;they are older than we (by analogy with &quot;...than we are&quot;), but &quot;she likes him better than me&quot; (if the intended meaning is &quot;...than she likes me&quot;).

<text>French personal pronouns (analogous to English &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he/she&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, etc.) reflect the person and number of their referent, and in the case of the third person, its gender as well (much like the English distinction between &quot;him&quot; and &quot;her&quot;, except that French lacks an inanimate third person pronoun &quot;it&quot; or a gender neutral &quot;they&quot; and thus draws this distinction among all third person nouns, singular and plural). They also reflect the role they play in their clause: subject, direct object, indirect object, or other.

Personal pronouns display a number of grammatical particularities and complications not found in their English counterparts: some of them can only be used in certain circumstances; some of them change form depending on surrounding words; and their placement is largely unrelated to the placement of the nouns they replace.

==Overview==


===The second person===

French has a T-V distinction in the second person singular. That is, it uses two different sets of pronouns: and and their various forms.

The usage of and depends on the kind of relationship (formal or informal) that exists between the speaker and the person with whom they are speaking and the age differences between these subjects. The pronoun is informal and singular, spoken to an individual who is equal or junior to the speaker. The pronoun is used in the singular (but with second-person plural verb forms) to speak to an individual who is senior to the speaker or socially &quot;more important&quot; than the speaker. is also used in the plural for all groups of people, whether junior, equal or senior.

==Subject pronouns==

As noted above, the personal pronouns change form to reflect the role they play in their clause. The forms used for subjects are called the &quot;subject pronouns&quot;, &quot;subjective pronouns&quot;, or &quot;nominative pronouns&quot;. They are as follows:

When the predicate is () plus a noun phrase, the pronoun ( in elision contexts) is normally used instead of the other third person subject pronouns. For example, (&quot;He is a smart man&quot;), (&quot;Those are my parents&quot;). is primarily used as a &quot;neuter&quot; pronoun to refer to events and situations: , &quot;I saw John yesterday. It was fun.&quot;

Another &quot;neuter&quot; pronoun is when used as the &quot;dummy subject&quot; of an impersonal verb, like English &quot;it&quot; in the same context: , , , , , etc.

Neologisms such as &quot;()&quot;, , , and have emerged in recent years as gender-neutral alternatives to the masculine and feminine pronouns, but are not yet considered standard in French despite their use in some speech communities. (plural ) is the most widely-known and used gender-neutral pronoun.

The third person plural is masculine () when a group contains both males and females or masculine and feminine nouns. This grammar rule is sometimes considered sexist. To erase sexism, a neutral plural pronoun such as can be used by some French people.

===&quot;On&quot;===
The subject pronoun (from Old French , from Latin ) takes third-person singular verb forms in the same way that and do, and is used:

* In the same way as English &quot;one&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;they&quot;, where the subject is generalised or otherwise unclear or unimportant:
: &quot;It is by blacksmithing that one becomes a blacksmith.&quot;
: &quot;to think that you are right,&quot; i.e. &quot;to think oneself right.&quot;
* As an extension of the above, it is often used to avoid the passive voice in French:
: &quot;[Someone] gave it to me.&quot; In English, it would be more common to say, &quot;It was given to me.&quot;, which would be rendered as in French.
* To replace the subject pronoun in informal speech. In this case, takes plural adjectives, even though it always takes a third-person singular verb. The corresponding reflexive object pronoun, , is also third-person, but first-person possessive pronouns must be used when meaning is the antecedent. The associated disjunctive pronoun in this context is .
: &quot;We are about to go.&quot;
: &quot;Us, we are American, and you, you are French.&quot;
: &quot;Shall we get rid of our luggage?&quot;

It is used for the number &quot;one&quot;, or as in &quot;one of them&quot;. As in English, numbers can be used as pronouns, and this is also true of the French word &quot;()&quot;: 
: &quot;Two went in and one came back out.&quot;

 has limited pronoun forms: it has only a reflexive form, , and a disjunctive form (which is also only used when the sense is reflexive). The pronoun () can sometimes be used to fill the roles of :
: &quot;Someone told me...&quot;

==Direct-object pronouns==
Like the English &quot;him&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, and &quot;them&quot;, the pronouns , , and are only used with direct objects. For ones (e.g., &quot;some juice&quot;), is used; see , below.

, , and are not used when the direct object refers to the same entity as the subject; see , below.

Examples:
* (I have a book.) I am giving &quot;it&quot; to the teacher. 
* (Danielle is my sister.) Have you seen &quot;her&quot;? 

==Indirect-object pronouns==


In French, an indirect object is an object of a verb that is introduced using a preposition (especially the preposition ). For example, in the sentence (&quot;I spoke to Jean&quot;), is the indirect object in the French sentence.

Indirect-object pronouns (or &quot;dative pronouns&quot;) generally only replace indirect objects with the preposition . When an indirect object pronoun is used, it replaces the entire prepositional phrase; for example, (&quot;I gave him a book&quot;).

Broadly speaking, and are used to refer to people, and (see , below) is used to refer to things. However, and will sometimes also be used in referring to things.

, , and are replaced with ( before a vowel) when the indirect object refers to the same entity as the subject; see , below.

As mentioned above, the indirect object pronouns are not always used to replace indirect objects:
* They are not used when the preposition is rather than ; but see , below.
* Some verbs are incompatible with indirect object pronouns, such as () and all reflexive verbs. For example, one says, (&quot;I put my trust in him&quot;), .

==Reflexive pronouns==


In French, as in English, reflexive pronouns are used in place of direct- and indirect-object pronouns that refer to the same entity or entities as the subject. A verb with a reflexive pronoun is called a &quot;reflexive verb&quot;, and has many grammatical particularities aside from the choice of pronoun; see French verbs.

There are four kinds of reflexive verbs:
# Verbs that are inherently reflexive. For example, the verb () has no non-reflexive counterpart; the verb has no meaning on its own.
# Verbs whose direct or indirect objects refer to the same entities as their subjects. For example, (&quot;I shall buy myself that&quot;) is just a special case of (&quot;I shall buy him that&quot;) that happens to be reflexive.
# Verbs indicating reciprocal actions. For example, means &quot;They are talking to each other.&quot; In cases of possible ambiguity, the reciprocal interpretation can be reinforced by adding .
# Verbs indicating a passive action. For example, one might say, , which literally means, &quot;The door is opening itself,&quot; but really means, &quot;The door is opening.&quot;
All four kinds use the reflexive pronouns, and exhibit the grammatical particularities of reflexive verbs.

==Disjunctive pronouns==


&quot;Disjunctive pronouns&quot; are the strong forms of French pronouns, the forms used in isolation and in emphatic positions (compare the use of &quot;me&quot; in the English sentence &quot;Me, I believe you, but I am not sure anyone else will&quot;; for more, see Intensive pronoun).

In French, disjunctive pronouns are used in the following circumstances:
* as the objects of prepositions: « Je le fais pour toi », &quot;I am doing it for you.&quot;
* in dislocated positions: « Toi, je t&#x27;ai déjà vu, moi. », &quot;You, I have seen you before, I have.&quot;
* in cleft sentences: « C&#x27;est toi qui as tort », &quot;It is you who are wrong.&quot; &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;It is you who have error/wrong.&quot;
* in compound noun phrases: « Lui et moi sommes américains », &quot;He and I are American&quot; (though one might equally say, « Lui et moi, nous sommes américains / on est américains »).
* as emphatic subjects (third person only): « Lui sait le faire », &quot;He knows how to do it&quot; (though one might equally say, « Lui, il sait le faire »).

The reflexive disjunctive form &quot;soi&quot; can be used as the object of a preposition, if it refers to the same entity as the subject. For example, « Un voyageur sait se sentir chez soi n&#x27;importe où », &quot;A traveller knows how to feel at home anywhere.&quot; Note that this does &quot;not&quot; make the verb reflexive.

==The pronoun &quot;y&quot;==

The pronoun &quot;y&quot; has two distinct uses:
* It is the indirect-object pronoun used with things introduced by the preposition &quot;à&quot;. For more on this use, see above.
* It is used to replace a spatial prepositional phrase. In this sense, it might be translated as &quot;there&quot;. For example:
*: « Je vais &quot;à Paris&quot;. » → « J″y vais. » (&quot;I am going &quot;to Paris&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I am going there.&quot;)
*: « Est-ce que tu travailles &quot;dans ce bureau&quot; ? — Non, je n″y travaille plus. » (&quot;Do you work &quot;in that office&quot;? — No, I do not work there anymore.&quot;)
* It is used idiomatically with certain verbs, without replacing anything:
*: « Il doit y avoir une erreur. » (&quot;There must be a mistake.&quot;)
*: « Je commence à y voir un peu plus clair. » (&quot;I am starting to see things more clearly.&quot;)

==The pronoun &quot;en&quot;==

The pronoun &quot;en&quot; has the following uses:
*It is the indirect-object pronoun used with things (including infinitives) introduced by the preposition &quot;de&quot;. It is also sometimes used in the same way with people (however, it is more common to use disjunctive pronouns rather than using &quot;en&quot; in the case of people).:
*:« Je parle &quot;du problème&quot;. » → « J″en parle. » (&quot;I am talking &quot;about the problem&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I am talking about it.&quot;)
*:« Je parle &quot;de Jean&quot;. » → « J″en parle. » &quot;or&quot; « Je parle &quot;de lui&quot;. » (&quot;I am talking &quot;about Jean&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I am talking about him.&quot;)
*It is used to replace a spatial prepositional phrase introduced by &quot;de&quot; (&quot;from&quot;). In this sense, it might be translated as &quot;from there&quot;:
*:« Je viens &quot;de France&quot;. » → « J″en viens. » (&quot;I come &quot;from France&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I come &quot;from there&quot;.&quot;)
*It is the direct-object pronoun used to replace indefinite direct objects; that is, direct objects that are:
**introduced by the partitive article (including the plural indefinite article)
**:« J″ai bu &quot;du jus de pomme&quot;. » → « J″en ai bu. » (&quot;I drank &quot;some apple juice&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I drank &quot;some&quot;.&quot;)
**introduced by &quot;de&quot; when the verb is negated
**:« Je n&#x27;ai pas vu &quot;de vaches&quot;. » → Je n&#x27;en ai pas vu. (&quot;I did not see&quot; any cows&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I did not see &quot;any&quot;.&quot;)
**introduced by a numeral (including the singular indefinite article) or a plural expression (&quot;d&#x27;autres&quot;, &quot;certains&quot;, &quot;quelques&quot;)
**:« J&#x27;ai mangé &quot;une pomme&quot;. » → « J″en ai mangé &quot;une&quot;. » (&quot;I ate &quot;an apple&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I ate &quot;one&quot;.&quot;)
**:« J&#x27;ai mangé &quot;quelques pommes&quot;. » → J″en ai mangé &quot;quelques-unes&quot;. (&quot;I ate &quot;a number of apples&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I ate &quot;a number of them&quot;.&quot;)
**introduced by another expression of quantity (usually an adverb + &quot;de&quot;)
**:« J&#x27;ai vendu &quot;beaucoup de jus de pomme&quot;. » → « J″en ai vendu &quot;beaucoup&quot;. » (&quot;I sold &quot;a lot of apple juice&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I sold &quot;a lot&quot;.&quot;)
**:« J&#x27;ai acheté &quot;trois kilogrammes de pommes&quot;. » → « J″en ai acheté &quot;trois kilogrammes&quot;. » (&quot;I bought &quot;three kilograms of apples&quot;.&quot; → &quot;I bought &quot;three kilograms&quot;.&quot;)
*It is used idiomatically with certain verbs, without replacing anything:
*:« J&#x27;en veux à Jean. » (&quot;I am mad at Jean.&quot;)
*:« Je vais en finir avec lui. » (&quot;I am going to finish things off with him.&quot;)

==Clitic order==
French personal pronouns, aside from their disjunctive forms, are all clitics, and the order of pronominal clitics as well as the negative clitic &quot;ne&quot; is strictly determined as follows. Only one clitic can be used for each slot. Where one wishes to express an idea that would involve slots that cannot coexist or multiple pronouns from the same slot, the indirect object is expressed as the object of &quot;à&quot; or &quot;pour&quot; (thus &quot;Je me donne à toi&quot; – &quot;I give myself to you&quot;). The use of more than two clitics beyond the subject and, where necessary, &quot;ne&quot; is uncommon; constructions such as &quot;Je lui y en ai donné&quot; may be perceived as unacceptable, and other constructions must then be used to express the same ideas.

;Proclitic order: Slots 3 and 5 cannot coexist.
;Enclitic order: Used only for positive imperatives. Slots 2 and 3 cannot coexist.
# The clitics &quot;-moi&quot; and &quot;-toi&quot; become &quot;-m&#x27;&quot; and &quot;-t&#x27;&quot; respectively when followed by either &quot;-en&quot; or &quot;-y&quot;. In colloquial French, however, it is possible to keep &quot;-moi&quot; and &quot;-toi&quot; intact and change &quot;-en&quot; and &quot;-y&quot; to &quot;-z-en&quot; and &quot;-z-y&quot; respectively, or to put slot 5 before slot 3, or less commonly, before slot 1 or 2.
#:ex. The imperative sentences corresponding to « &quot;Tu m&#x27;en donnes&quot; »:
#:« Donne-m&#x27;en. » (formal)
#:« Donne-moi-z-en. » (informal)
#:« Donnes-en-moi. » (informal)

<doc id="1276856" wikidata="Q2983417" url="?curid=1276856" title="Islam in Libya">
<text>Islam is the dominant religion in Libya, with 97% of Libyans following Sunni Islam. Article 5 of the Libyan Constitution declared that Islam was the official religion of the state. The post-revolution National Transitional Council has explicitly endeavored to reaffirm Islamic values, enhance appreciation of Islamic culture, elevate the status of Quranic law and, to a considerable degree, emphasize Quranic practice in everyday Libyan life with legal implementation in accordance to Islamic jurisprudence known as sharia. Libya has a small presence of Ahmadis and Shias, primarily consisting of Pakistani immigrants, though unrecognized by the state.

==History==
During the seventh century, Muslims, who were spreading their faith, reached Libya and began proselytizing. The urban centers soon became substantially Islamic, but widespread conversion of the nomads of the Sahara did not come until after large-scale invasions in the eleventh century by Bedouin tribes from Arabia and Egypt.

Many pre-Islamic beliefs that had existed in Libya co-mingled with the newly introduced religion. Hence, Islam in Libya became an overlay of Quranic ritual and principles upon the vestiges of earlier beliefs -- prevalent throughout North Africa -- in jinns (spirits), the evil eye, rites to ensure good fortune, and cult veneration of local saints. 

===Islam in Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya===


Under the revolutionary Gaddafi government, the role of orthodox Islam in Libyan life became progressively more important.

Soon after taking office, the Gaddafi government began closing bars and nightclubs, banning entertainment deemed provocative or immodest, and making use of the Islamic calendar mandatory. The intention of reestablishing sharia was announced, and Gaddafi personally assumed chairmanship of a commission to study the problems involved. In November 1973, a new legal code was issued that revised the entire Libyan judicial system to conform to the sharia, and in 1977 the General People&#x27;s Congress (GPC) issued a statement that all future legal codes would be based on the Quran.

Among the laws enacted by the Gaddafi government were a series of legal penalties prescribed during 1973 which included the punishment of armed robbery by amputation of a hand and a foot. The legislation contained qualifying clauses making its execution unlikely, but its enactment had the effect of applying Quranic principles in the modern era. Another act prescribed flogging for individuals breaking the fast of Ramadan, and yet another called for eighty lashes to be administered to both men and women guilty of fornication.

In the early 1970s, Islam played a major role in legitimizing Gaddafi&#x27;s political and social reforms. By the end of the decade, however, he had begun to attack the religious establishment and several fundamental aspects of Sunni Islam. Gaddafi asserted the transcendence of the Quran as the sole guide to Islamic governance and the unimpeded ability of every Muslim to read and interpret it. He denigrated the roles of the ulama, imams, and Islamic jurists and questioned the authenticity of the hadith, and thereby the sunna, as a basis for Islamic law. The sharia itself, Gaddafi maintained, governed only such matters as properly fell within the sphere of religion; all other matters lay outside the purview of religious law. Finally, he called for a revision of the Islamic calendar, saying it should date from Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, an event he felt was more momentous than the hijra ten years earlier.

The government took a leading role in supporting Islamic institutions and in worldwide proselytizing on behalf of Islam. The Jihad Fund, supported by a payroll tax, was established in 1970 to aid the Palestinians in their struggle with Israel. The Faculty of Islamic Studies and Arabic at the University of Benghazi was charged with training Muslim intellectual leaders for the entire Islamic world, and the Islamic Mission Society used public funds for the construction and repair of mosques and Islamic educational centers in cities as widely separated as Vienna and Bangkok.

==Saints and brotherhoods==

Islam as practiced in North Africa is interlaced with indigenous Berber beliefs. Although the Sufi orthodoxy preached the unique and inimitable majesty and Sanctity of God and the equality of God&#x27;s Believers, an important element of Islam for centuries has been a belief in the coalescence of special spiritual power given by God to particular living human beings. The power is known as Barakah, a transferable quality of personal blessedness and spiritual force said to lodge in certain individuals. Those whose claim to possess Barakah can be substantiated—through performance of apparent Miracles, exemplary human insight, or genealogical connection with a recognized possessor—are viewed as saints. These persons are known in the West as marabouts, a French transliteration of al murabitun (those who have made a religious retreat), and the benefits of their Baraka are believed to accrue to those ordinary people who come in contact with them.

The true Islamic way of saints became widespread in rural areas; in urban localities, Islam in its Sunni form prevail. Saints were present in Tripolitania, but they were particularly numerous in Cyrenaica. Their Baraka continued to reside in their tombs after their deaths. The number of venerated tombs varied from tribe to tribe, although there tended to be fewer among the camel herders of the desert than among the sedentary and nomadic tribes of the plateau area. In one village, a visitor in the late 1960s counted sixteen still-venerated tombs.

Coteries of frequently clustered around particular saints, especially those who preached an original tariqa (devotional &quot;way&quot;). Brotherhoods of the followers of such mystical teachers appeared in North Africa at least as early as the eleventh century and in some cases became mass movements. The founder ruled an order of followers, who were organized under the frequently absolute authority of a leader, or sheikh. The brotherhood was centered on a zawiya.

Sufi adherents gathered into brotherhoods, and Sufi orders became extremely popular, particularly in rural areas. Sufi brotherhoods exercised great influence and ultimately played an important part in the religious revival that swept through North Africa during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In Libya, when the Ottoman Empire proved unable to mount effective resistance to the encroachment of Christian missionaries, the work was taken over by Sufi-inspired revivalist movements. Among these, the most forceful and effective was that of the Senussi, which extended into numerous parts of North Africa.

===Senusiyya===

The Senusiyya, or Senussi movement, was a sufi religious revival adapted to desert life. Its zawiyas could be found in Tripolitania and Fezzan, but its influence was strongest in Cyrenaica. The Senusiyya&#x27;s first theocracy was in the city of Bayda, Cyrenaica and that was their center in 1841. After the Italian occupation, the focus turned from government to seminary education and then to the creation of an Islamic University which became in 1960 the University of Mohammed bin Ali al-Sanusi. The arrival of Gaddafi&#x27;s rule changed the course of the university. It is now known as the Omar Al-Mukhtar University. 

The Senussis formed a nucleus of resistance to the Italian colonization of Libya. As Libyan nationalism fostered by unified resistance to the Italians gained adherents, however, the religious fervor of devotion to the movement began to wane, particularly after the Italians destroyed Senussi religious and educational centers during the 1930s. Nonetheless, Idris of Libya was the grandson of the founder of the Senussi movement, and his status as a Senussi gave him the unique ability to command respect from the disparate parts of the Kingdom of Libya.

Despite its momentary political prominence, the Senussi movement never regained its strength as a religious force after its zawiyas were destroyed. A promised restoration never fully took place, and the Idrisid regime used the Senussi heritage as a means of legitimizing political authority rather than to provide religious leadership.

After unseating Idris in 1969, the revolutionary government placed restrictions on the operation of the remaining zawiyas, appointed a supervisor for Senussi properties, and merged the Senussi-sponsored Islamic University with the University of Libya. The movement was virtually banned, but in the 1980s occasional evidence of Senussi activity was nonetheless reported. Senussi-inspired activists were instrumental in freeing Cyrenaica from Gaddafi&#x27;s control during the 2011 Libyan Civil War.

<text>Greta Bösel (née Mueller) (9 May 1908 – 3 May 1947) was a Nazi German nurse and camp guard at Ravensbrück concentration camp. She was arrested and tried for her role in the Holocaust, found guilty of war crimes, and subsequently executed.

== Nazi atrocities, trial and execution ==
Bösel was born on 9 May 1908 in Wuppertal-Elberfeld, Germany. She was a trained nurse.

Bösel became a camp guard at Ravensbrück in August 1944. Her rank at the camp was &quot;Arbeitseinsatzführerin&quot; (Work Input Overseer), a leading assistant in the camp labour office. In November 1944, Bösel was supposed to have been one of the staff members to select prisoners for the gas chamber, or for transfer to Uckermark. She is known to have told another Nazi SS guard &quot;If they [prisoners] cannot work, let them rot.&quot;

After the death march of prisoners out of Ravensbrück following the impending liberation by the Red Army of Soviet troops, Bösel fled the camp with her husband. She was later caught and arrested by British troops.

Bösel, along with other female guards including Dorothea Binz, stood accused at the first Ravensbrück Trial, which took place between December 1946 and February 1947 in Hamburg, Germany. The court found her guilty of maltreatment, murder and taking part in the &quot;selections&quot;. She was executed for her crimes at 9:55 am on 3 May 1947, 24 minutes after Elisabeth Marschall, by Albert Pierrepoint in Hamelin Prison.

<doc id="1276863" wikidata="Q5361588" url="?curid=1276863" title="List of countries by tax rates">
<text>A comparison of tax rates by countries is difficult and somewhat subjective, as tax laws in most countries are extremely complex and the tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national unit. The list focuses on the main types of taxes: corporate tax, individual income tax, and sales tax, including VAT and GST and capital gains tax, but does not list wealth tax or inheritance tax.

Personal income tax includes all applicable taxes, including all unvested social security contributions. Vested social security contributions are not included as they contribute to the personal wealth and will be paid back upon retirement or emigration, either as lump sum or as pension. Only social security contributions without a ceiling can be included in the highest marginal tax rate as only those are effectively a tax for general distribution among the population.

Some other taxes (for instance property tax, substantial in many countries, such as the United States) and income tax are not shown here. The table is not exhaustive in representing the true tax burden to either the corporation or the individual in the listed country. The tax rates displayed are marginal and do not account for deductions, exemptions or rebates. The effective rate is usually lower than the marginal rate. The tax rates given for federations (such as the United States and Canada) are averages and vary depending on the state or province. Territories that have different rates to their respective nation are in italics.

<text>British Rail allocated Class 499 to a fleet of six luggage vans used in electric multiple unit formations on boat train services between London and Dover. They were allocated Southern Region class TLV (meaning Trailer Luggage Van).

They were converted from former Brake Gangwayed (BG) vehicles in 1968 to supplement the Class 419 Motor Luggage Van fleet. However, following the decline of boat train traffic, they were all stored in 1975. After a period in use as match wagons for transferring new Class 432 and 491 units from York Works, they were all taken into departmental stock initially as stores vans, but later as breakdown train tool vans.
TOPS class 499 was subsequently reused for London Underground rolling stock that needed to operate on main line tracks.

<doc id="1276878" wikidata="Q526173" url="?curid=1276878" title="Marc Cherry">
<text>Marc Cherry (born March 23, 1962) is an American television writer and producer. He is best known for creating the ABC dramedy series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Early life ===
Marc Cherry was born in Long Beach, California, and lived briefly in Oklahoma during his childhood. His father was an accountant whose work brought him back to California. After graduating from Troy High School in Fullerton, Cherry attended California State University, Fullerton. He graduated from the school’s theater program in 1985 and initially considered a career in performance. After winning $15,000 as a contestant on &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; in 1986, he decided to move to Hollywood and pursue writing work. His move came at a bad time; the 1988 writers strike hit as soon as Cherry arrived. Cherry broke into the industry by working as &quot;Designing Women&quot; star Dixie Carter&#x27;s personal assistant.

=== Political views ===
In 2007, &quot;Newsweek&quot; described Cherry as a &quot;somewhat conservative, gay Republican.&quot; He was the 2006 recipient of the Log Cabin Republicans&#x27; American Visibility Award. However, in 2018, Cherry said that he &quot;stopped being a Republican the second [Donald Trump&#x27;s] foot hit the escalator.&quot;

=== Family ===

On September 12, 2020, his mother, Martha Kay Cherry, passed away.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===

In 1990, he became a writer and producer for the long-running hit sitcom &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and later its short-lived spinoff &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;. Cherry next co-created &quot;The 5 Mrs. Buchanans&quot;, a sitcom centered on four women married to brothers and their difficult mother-in-law, which had a brief run on CBS during the 1994-1995 season. Cherry also co-created &quot;The Crew&quot; (1995). On his own, he later created &quot;Some of My Best Friends&quot;, a 2001 sitcom that was based in part on the 1997 film &quot;Kiss Me, Guido&quot;.

===&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;===

In 2002, a conversation with his mother inspired him to develop a show about the fractured lives of four upper middle class suburban women. After HBO, FOX, CBS, NBC, Showtime, and Lifetime all passed on the show, circumstances changed for Cherry&#x27;s show when his agent was arrested and sent to jail for embezzlement. His new agents brought the show to the attention of ABC, which decided to pick it up. The series, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, was an immediate ratings smash and generated enormous national (and subsequently, international) debate. Cherry received several lucrative offers from various parties, but chose to sign a long-term deal with Touchstone, since their co-brand, the ABC network, had shown faith in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; when other companies passed.

Cherry featured several actors on &quot;Housewives&quot; with whom he had previously worked. Mark Moses, who played Paul Young, and Harriet Sansom Harris, who played Felicia Tilman, were both cast members of &quot;The 5 Mrs. Buchanans&quot;. In season three, Cherry cast former boss Dixie Carter in the role of Gloria Hodge, Orson&#x27;s unhinged mother. Actor Alec Mapa, who appeared in &quot;Some of My Best Friends&quot;, appeared on &quot;&quot;Housewives&quot; in a recurring role as Gabrielle&#x27;s stylist.

Cherry appeared in a cameo as one of Susan&#x27;s moving men on the final episode of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

==== Nicolette Sheridan accusations and termination ====
On April 5, 2010, former &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; main cast member Nicollette Sheridan filed a $20 million lawsuit against Cherry and ABC, alleging that he had assaulted her on set and wrongfully terminated her contract. Sheridan also alleged in her lawsuit that Cherry was abusive to other actors and writers on the show. ABC said in a statement that they had investigated similar claims made by Sheridan and found them to be of no merit.

The other principal cast members of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, including Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross and Eva Longoria, made statements supporting Cherry. In December 2010, Sheridan removed abuse claims from the suit.

The case finally went to trial in February 2012. On March 13, 2012, the judge dismissed the battery charge against Cherry due to lack of evidence, and Cherry was no longer a defendant in the lawsuit which then focused solely on Sheridan&#x27;s alleged wrongful termination by ABC. Closing arguments were heard in the case on March 14, 2012, and the jury began their deliberations. By March 19, 2012, the twelve members of the jury had failed to reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. A retrial was scheduled to begin on September 10, 2012, but on August 16, 2012, the Los Angeles Court of Appeal determined that Sheridan had not been wrongfully fired and dismissed the retrial. A further appeal made by Sheridan to the California Supreme Court was rejected on November 16, 2012.

===&quot;Devious Maids&quot;===

In 2012, after the end of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, Cherry and Eva Longoria began working on a new series, &quot;Devious Maids&quot;. Initially it had been produced for ABC, but it then aired on Lifetime.

The series is set in Beverly Hills and the protagonists are Latina maids: Marisol (Ana Ortiz), Rosie (Dania Ramirez), Carmen (Roselyn Sanchez), Zoila (Judy Reyes), and Valentina (Edy Ganem), who work for celebrities or rich people. They not only clean the homes of celebrities, but also put order in their lives, and sometimes fall in love. Just like the women of Wisteria Lane, these maids have to deal with mysteries and secrets, since, during the first episode, one of their friends, the maid Flora, is mysteriously murdered, and it&#x27;s up to Marisol to investigate the murder and to exonerate her son Eddie, wrongly accused.

Even for &quot;Devious Maids&quot;, Marc Cherry hired someone who had worked with him: Roselyn Sanchez, who plays Carmen Luna, one of the maids, appeared in the last episode of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. Others in &quot;Devious Maids&quot; who had previously worked with Cherry include Rebecca Wisocky, Melinda Page Hamilton, Valerie Mahaffey, Matt Cedeno, Richard Burgi, and James Denton.

===&quot;Why Women Kill&quot;===
On September 24, 2018, it was announced that CBS All Access had given the production a straight-to-series order.&quot; Why Women Kill&quot; was created by Cherry, who was also expected to executive produce alongside Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Michael Hanel, and Mindy Schultheis. Production companies involved with the series were slated to consist of Imagine Entertainment and CBS Television Studios. On December 10, 2018, it was reported that the series would receive $8.4 million dollars in tax credits from the state of California and premiered on August 15, 2019.

=== Other ventures ===
Cherry appeared as himself in the &quot;Righteous Brothers&quot; episode of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, which was created by fellow &quot;Golden Girls&quot; writer Mitchell Hurwitz. In 2014 and 2016, Cherry was a judge and mentor for the Songbook Academy, a summer intensive for high school students operated by the Great American Songbook Foundation and founded by Michael Feinstein. Cherry serves on the board of directors of The Young Americans youth performing arts group and is a 1979 alumnus of the organization.

<text>Daniel Coon Davis (February 23, 1804 – June 1, 1850) was the captain of Company E in the Mormon Battalion. He became an early leader of Davis County, Utah, which is named after him.

Davis was born in Petersburg, New York.

Davis was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at Council Bluffs, Iowa. In 1839, he was appointed master of the ferry that traveled between Nauvoo, Illinois and Montrose, Iowa.

Captain Davis led a company in the Mormon Battalion during the Mexican War. His wife Susan and son Daniel Jr. accompanied Company E at the beginning of their trek west. Daniel Jr. was the son of Davis first wife, Sophronia Fuller, who had died. Daniel Jr. at six was the youngest person to go all the way with the Mormon Battalion. Later, Davis led many Mormon pioneer groups across the plains to settle the West. In 1849 Davis settled on Davis Creek in what is now Farmington, Utah. In early 1850, on one such trip, Captain Davis became ill and died near Fort Kearney, Nebraska, on his way back to the outfitting stations on the Missouri River.

<text>Room Service is a 1938 American comedy film directed by William A. Seiter, based on the 1937 play of the same name by Allen Boretz and John Murray. The film stars the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo and Chico) and also features Lucille Ball, Ann Miller and Frank Albertson. It was produced and distributed by RKO Pictures; RKO paid $255,000 for filming rights, which was then a record for a sound picture.

This is the only film starring the Marx Brothers with a screenplay based on material that was not written especially for the team. Less frenetic and more physically contained than their other films, the plot revolves around the shenanigans of a broke Broadway producer getting a play staged and funded by a mysterious backer, while evading eviction from a hotel.

RKO remade the movie in 1944 as &quot;Step Lively&quot;, starring George Murphy and Frank Sinatra.

==Plot==
Gordon Miller, a flat-broke theatrical producer, whose staff includes Harry Binelli and Faker Englund, is told by his brother-in-law Joseph Gribble, manager of the White Way Hotel, that he and his cast of twenty-two actors, who have run up a bill of $1,200, must leave the hotel immediately or face the wrath of supervising director Gregory Wagner who has arrived to inspect the books. Miller has hidden the cast and crew of his play, &quot;Hail and Farewell&quot;, in the empty hotel ballroom. Miller is planning on skipping out on the hotel without paying the bill when he receives word that one of his actresses, Christine Marlowe, has found a financial backer for the play. Miller must avoid being evicted and keep the company hidden in the hotel until he can meet with the backer and receive a check.

At the same time, Wagner discovers Miller&#x27;s $1200 debt. Assured by Gribble that Miller had skipped without paying his bill, Wagner is surprised to find Miller still in the hotel, now joined by Leo Davis, the play&#x27;s young author who has arrived unexpectedly. Davis is also broke and hopes to collect an advance on his royalties from the play.

When Wagner threatens to throw Miller out of the hotel before the backer can arrive, Miller and Binelli convince Davis to pretend to be sick. Hungry and with no money for food, Miller promises hotel waiter Sasha Smirnoff a part in the play in exchange for a meal. When Davis leaves to meet with new love interest Hilda Manney, Englund takes over as the sick patient to be examined by Dr. Glass, brought in by Wagner. To delay the doctor giving his report to Wagner, Binelli and Miller tie Glass up, gag him, and lock him in the bathroom. Simon Jenkins, the agent for the wealthy backer, arrives with the check and contract. Wagner returns and interrupts just as Jenkins is about to sign over the check; Binelli and Gribble arrive. After Dr. Glass is freed, he angrily tells Wagner that he overheard everything while tied up in the bathroom: Miller was about to transact a legitimate deal. During the commotion, Jenkins is accidentally hit on the head by Englund as he chases a flying turkey around with a baseball bat. Jenkins, desperately trying to escape the madness, quickly signs over the check and flees.

Davis returns and informs Miller he saw Jenkins in the lobby who told him he is stopping payment on the check and signed it only to get out of the room. Wagner is fooled into believing all is well, and upgrades the boys to a pricier room and extends them more credit. Later, just as the play is about to open, Wagner discovers the check has bounced and has Miller, Binelli, Englund and Davis locked in their room. They manipulate Wagner into believing he&#x27;s driven Davis to suicide by ingesting poison. They pretend to give Davis large quantities of Ipecac (which is actually drunk by Englund), and he eventually pretends to die. Then Englund fakes suicide. Wagner is bluffed into believing he drove both Davis and Englund to kill themselves and helps take Englund&#x27;s &quot;body&quot; down to the alley. As Miller and Wagner prop up Englund on a crate, a passing policeman asks what&#x27;s going on. Miller bluffs their way out of the situation, so he and Wagner make an escape, leaving Englund &quot;asleep&quot; in the alley. They watch the end of the play, a scene where the miners are bringing a dead body from out of the mine. The body on the stretcher is Englund&#x27;s. Wagner realizes he&#x27;s been duped as the play is greeted with thunderous applause and he faints when he sees Davis alive.

==Cast==

*Indicates the actor created the role on Broadway.

==Production==
Zeppo Marx, who had retired from the screen after &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, was now a Hollywood agent representing his brothers. He brokered a deal with RKO to produce the version of the Broadway play &quot;Room Service&quot; by John Murray and Allan Boretz. The play was adapted for the Marxes by Morrie Ryskind. &quot;Room Service&quot; was the only film in which neither the story nor the characters were created especially for the Marx Brothers.

This was only the second Marx Brothers film (the other being &quot;Duck Soup&quot;) in which Chico does not play the piano and Harpo does not play the harp.

Ann Miller was only 15 years old when she made this film. She had lied about her age and obtained a fake birth certificate when she was about 14 years old, which stated that she was 18, just prior to signing with RKO Pictures. In a &quot;Private Screenings&quot; interview with Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movies, Miller described her experience with the Marx brothers. Miller described a situation in which Harpo Marx dropped his pants in front of her, beeped his horn and chased her across the set. Miller described her being so &quot;scared to death of the man&quot; and thought he was &quot;crazy&quot;, but she &quot;loved&quot; Groucho Marx.

==Reception==
Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that the film had not changed much from the play and &quot;the Marxes haven&#x27;t made it any funnier; but neither has their presence interfered to any large extent with the disorderly progress of an antic piece. While there may be some question about the play&#x27;s being a perfect Marx vehicle, there can be none about its being a thoroughly daffy show.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it would &quot;do plenty of business and satisfy on the laugh score.&quot; &quot;Sure-fire comedy smash ... the hilarious proceedings find the Marx Brothers right in their element,&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;A good comedy&quot; with a &quot;pleasant&quot; romance. John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;As comic pictures go, this ranks certainly above average; it has enough of the Marxian note for that. As Marx Brothers movies go, however, it is a minor effort.&quot;

The film recorded a loss of $330,000.

==In popular culture==
* The basic plot of &quot;Room Service&quot; was used for the &quot;Monkees, Manhattan Style&quot; episode of &quot;The Monkees&quot; (season 1, episode 30, first broadcast April 10, 1967, also known as &quot;Monkees in Manhattan&quot;).

<text>Ruth Closius-Neudeck (5 July 1920 – 29 July 1948) was a Nazi &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) supervisor at a Nazi concentration camp complex from December 1944 until March 1945. She was executed for war crimes for her role in the Holocaust.

==Early life==
Ruth Closius was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland). She hoped to become a nurse, but worked a saleswoman in a textiles warehouse. She later married and was known as Ruth Neudeck or Ruth Closius-Neudeck.

==Atrocities in Nazi concentration camps==
In July 1944, she arrived at the Ravensbrück concentration camp to begin her training to be a camp guard. Neudeck soon began impressing her superiors with her unbending brutality towards the female prisoners, resulting in her promotion to the rank of &quot;Blockführerin&quot; (Barrack Overseer) in late July 1944.

In the Ravensbrück camp, she was known as one of the most ruthless female guards. Former French prisoner Geneviève de Gaulle-Anthonioz commented after the war that she had seen Neudeck &quot;cut the throat of an inmate with the sharp edge of her shovel&quot;. Another survivor testified that Neudeck &quot;took off the clothes of some inmates, poured cold water over them and made them stand in the cold for hours.&quot;

In December 1944, Neudeck was promoted to the rank of Oberaufseherin, and moved to the Uckermark extermination complex subcamp close to Ravensbrück. There she was involved in the selection and execution of over 5,000 women and children and running of the gas chambers. The prisoners were mistreated by Neudeck or her fellow SS &quot;Aufseherinnen&quot;. In March 1945, Neudeck became head of the Barth subcamp.

==Capture, trial and execution==
In late April 1945, she fled the camp but was later captured and detained in prison while the British Army investigated the allegations against her. From 26 April 1948, she stood accused at the third Ravensbrück trial, along with other &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) women. The 28-year-old former SS supervisor admitted to the accusations of murder and maltreatment made against her.

The British court found Neudeck guilty of war crimes and sentenced her to death by hanging. On 29 July 1948, she was executed by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint on the gallows at Hamelin Prison.

<doc id="1276907" wikidata="Q642810" url="?curid=1276907" title="Missolonghi">
<text>Missolonghi or Mesolongi (, ) is a municipality of 32,048 people (according to the 2021 census) in western Greece. The town is the capital of Aetolia-Acarnania regional unit, and the seat of the municipality of Iera Polis Mesolongiou (). Missolonghi is known as the site of a dramatic siege during the Greek War of Independence, and of the death of poet Lord Byron.

==Geography==
The town is located between the Achelous and the Evinos rivers and has a port on the Gulf of Patras. It trades in fish, wine, and tobacco. The Arakynthos mountains lie to the northeast. The town is almost canalized but houses are within the gulf and the swamplands. The Missolonghi–Aitoliko Lagoons complex lies to the west. In the ancient times, the land was part of the gulf.

===Climate===
Summers are long, hot and humid, with temperatures rarely surpassing 40 °C and sometimes remaining above 25 °C at night. Winters are short, mild and humid with frequent rainfalls.

==Transport==

===National Transport===

The A5 Ionia Odos motorway passes north of Missolonghi.

The town had a railway station on the Hellenic Railways Organisation line from Krioneri to Agrinio but this has been abandoned since the 1970s.

The Intercity Buses Of Aitoloakarnania also have service towards Agrinio, Amfilochia, Astakos, Volos, Vonitsa, Thessaloniki, Lamia, Larisa, Livadeia, Mitikas, Patras, Chalkida and the capital Athens.

The local airport has a hard runway but no scheduled services. The closest airport with scheduled services is Aktion National Airport just an hour and half away.

Two new ferry connections towards Zakynthos, Cephalonia, and Ithaca were launched in 2020

==Education==
Three departments of the University of Patras are based in the city.

==Administration==
The municipality Missolonghi (official name: ) was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Aitoliko
*Missolonghi
*Oiniades

The municipal unit Missolonghi is subdivided into 8 communities:
*Agios Georgios 
*Agios Thomas 
*Ano Koudouni 
*Ellinika 
*Evinochori 
*Missolonghi 
*Mousoura 
*Retsina

The municipality has an area of 680.372 km2, the municipal unit 280.168 km2.

===Province===
The province of Missolonghi () was one of the provinces of the Aetolia-Acarnania Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Missolonghi (except part of the municipal unit Oiniades) and the municipal units Angelokastro, Arakynthos and Makryneia. It was abolished in 2006.

==History==
===Early history===
North-west of Missolonghi are the remains of Pleuron (modern Asfakovouni), a town mentioned in Homer&#x27;s works. It participated in the Trojan War and was destroyed in 234 BC by Demetrius II Aetolicus. The new town, which was built on the remains of old Pleuron, was one of the most important towns in Aetolia. Its monumental fortification comprised thirty towers and seven gates. The remains of the theatre and an enormous water tank with four compartments still exist.

The modern settlement of Missolonghi was first mentioned by a Venetian called Paruta when he was describing the naval Battle of Lepanto, which took place nearby. According to predominant historical opinion, its name came from the combination of two Italian words, &quot;mezzo&quot; and &quot;laghi&quot; which means &quot;in the middle of lakes&quot; or &quot;messo&quot; and &quot;laghi&quot; (Messolaghi) which means &quot;a place surrounded by lakes&quot;. 

The town grew as a fishing and trading hub. It was captured in 1684 by the Venetians, and held throughout the Morean War, but it was returned to the Ottoman Empire after the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz. The town joined the Orlov Revolt in 1770, but the uprising was quickly quelled and it returned to Ottoman rule.

===Greek War of Independence=== 

When the Greek War of Independence broke out in spring 1821, Missolonghi was the first place in western Greece to join the uprising, on 20 May 1821, under the leadership of the town notables, chiefly Athanasios Razikotsikas, Panos Papaloukas, and A. Kapsalis. With rumours of Greek successes in the Morea and eastern Greece spreading throughout April, most of the Turkish families of the town had already evacuated to nearby Vrachori, where there was a strong Ottoman military presence. Missolonghi was soon reinforced by the klepht chieftain Dimitrios Makris, who immediately occupied the nearby island of Anatoliko; there too, the few Turks abandoned the town without resistance and made for Vrachori.

Its location made it a vital bastion to the Greeks in the War of Independence: protected by a chain of small islands and its lagoon from the sea, and by a wall and the marshy terrain from the landward side, it was strategically located near the Peloponnese and the Ionian Islands. Coming from Marseilles, Alexandros Mavrokordatos landed in the town in July, and made it the base of his attempts to form his own power-base in western Greece, independent of the authority of Dimitrios Ypsilantis in the Morea. On 4 November, Mavrokordatos and his political allies convened an assembly of regional representatives in the town, which established a separate governing body, the &quot;Senate of Western Continental Greece&quot;.

The town&#x27;s fortifications were initially limited to a ditch wide and deep, in many places filled up with rubbish, as well as by a small wall, not higher than and in need of repair, with fourteen guns. Nevertheless, the city held out against the first Ottoman attempt to capture it in 1822. A 7,000-8,000 strong Ottoman army under Omer Vryonis and Mehmed Reshid Pasha laid siege to the city on 25 October 1822. The small Greek garrison of 500 men, under Mavrokordatos, managed to delay the Ottomans by pretending to negotiate a surrender until the Greek fleet landed reinforcements on 8 November. The subsequent Ottoman attacks were beaten off, and the onset of winter, disease, and the attacks of other Greek forces from the rear under Georgios Karaiskakis forced the Ottoman commanders to lift the siege on 31 December 1822. 

A second Ottoman attack, led by Vryonis and Mustafa Pasha of Scutari, was launched on 20 September 1823, and focused mostly on Anatoliko. Facing the onset of winter, disease, the failure of the simultaneous Ottoman operations in eastern Greece, and Greek attacks on their foraging parties, the Ottoman commanders abandoned the siege on 17 November.

Another siege started on 15 April 1825 by Reşid Mehmed Pasha whose army numbered 30,000 men and was later reinforced by another 10,000 men led by Ibrahim Pasha, son of Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt. After a year of relentless enemy attacks and facing starvation, the people of Missolonghi decided to leave the beleaguered city in the &quot;Exodus of its Guards&quot; (The Sortie) on the night of 10 April 1826. At the time, there were 10,500 people in Missolonghi, 3,500 of whom were armed. Very few people survived the Ottoman pincer movement after the betrayal of their plan.

Due to the heroic stance of the population and the subsequent massacre of its inhabitants by the Turkish-Egyptian forces, the town of Missolonghi received the honorary title of Hiera Polis (the Sacred City), unique among other Greek cities. The famous British poet and philhellene Lord Byron, who supported the Greek struggle for independence, died in Missolonghi in 1824. He is commemorated by a cenotaph, containing his heart, and a statue located in the town.

===Modern era===
The town itself is very picturesque but also modern with functional, regular urban planning. Some very interesting buildings representative of traditional architecture can be seen here. People whose names were related to modern Greek history once lived in some of them. The mansion of the Trikoupis family, Palamas&#x27; House, Valvios Library, Christos and Sophia Moschandreou Gallery of Modern Art emphasize the fact that Missolonghi has always been a city of some wealth and refinement. In addition, the Centre of Culture and Art, Diexodos, which hosts cultural events and exhibitions as well as the Museum of History and Art is housed in a neo-classical building in Markos Botsaris Square and hosts a collection of paintings indicative of the struggle of Missolonghi, further boosting the city&#x27;s cultural and artistic profile. The Messolonghi Byron Society also, founded in 1991 in the city, is a non profit organisation which is devoted to promoting scholarly and general understanding of Lord Byron&#x27;s life and poetry as well as cultivating appreciation for other historical figures in the 19th-century international Philhellenic movement, idealists who, like Byron, gave their fortunes, talents, and lives for the cause of Greek War of Independence. The Messolonghi Byron Center is now located in the upper floor of Byron House.

Today, the Entrance Gate remains intact and so does part of the fortification of the Free Besieged which was rebuilt by King Otto. Past the gate, there is the Garden of Heroes where several famous and some anonymous heroes who fought during the Heroic Sortie are buried. The Garden of Heroes is the equivalent of the Elysian Fields for modern Greece. Every year the Memorial Day for the Exodus is celebrated on Palm Sunday (the Sunday before Easter); the Greek State is represented by high-ranking officials and foreign countries by their ambassadors.

<text>The [[Mekong]] River Commission (MRC) is an &quot;...inter-governmental organisation that works directly with the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam to jointly manage the shared water resources and the sustainable development of the Mekong River&quot;. Its mission is &quot;To promote and coordinate sustainable management and development of water and related resources for the countries&#x27; mutual benefit and the people&#x27;s well-being&quot;.

==History==
===Mekong Committee (1957–1978)===
The origins of the Mekong Committee are linked to the legacy of (de)colonialism in Indochina and subsequent geopolitical developments. The political, social, and economic conditions of the Mekong River basin countries evolved dramatically since the 1950s, when the Mekong represented the &quot;only large river left in the world, besides the Amazon, which remained virtually unexploited.&quot; The impetus for the creation of the Mekong cooperative regime progressed in tandem with the drive for the development of the lower Mekong, following the 1954 Geneva Conference which granted Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam independence from France. A 1957 United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) report, &quot;Development of Water Resources in the Lower Mekong Basin&quot;, recommended development to the tune of 90,000 km2 of irrigation and 13.7 gigawatts (GW) from five dams. Based largely on the recommendations of ECAFE, the &quot;Committee for Coordination on the Lower Mekong Basin&quot; (known as the Mekong Committee) was established in September 1957 with the adoption of the &quot;Statute for the Committee for Coordination of Investigations into the Lower Mekong Basin&quot;. ECAFE&#x27;s Bureau of Flood Control had prioritized the Mekong—of the 18 international waterways within its jurisdiction—in the hopes of creating a precedent for cooperation elsewhere. and &quot;one of the UN&#x27;s earliest spin-offs&quot;, as the organization functioned under the aegis of the UN, with its Executive Agent (EA) chosen from the career staff of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

The US government—which feared that poverty in the basin would contribute to the strength of communist movements—proved one of the most vocal international backers of the committee, with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation conducting a seminal 1956 study on the basin&#x27;s potential. Another 1962 study by U.S. geographer Gilbert F. White, &quot;Economic and Social Aspects of Lower Mekong Development&quot;, proved extremely influential, resulting in the postponement of (in White&#x27;s own estimation) the construction of the (still unrealized) mainstream Pa Mong Dam, which would have displaced a quarter-million people. The influence of the United States in the committee&#x27;s formation can also been seen in development studies of General Raymond Wheeler, the former Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers, the role of C. Hart Schaaf as the Mekong Committee&#x27;s Executive Agent from 1959 to 1969, and President Lyndon Johnson’s promotion of the committee as having the potential to &quot;dwarf even our own T.V.A.&quot; However, US financial support was terminated in 1975 and did not resume for decades due to embargoes against Cambodia (until 1992) and Vietnam (until 1994), followed by periods of trade restrictions. However, Makim argues that the committee was &quot;largely unaffected by formal or informal U.S. preferences&quot; given the ambivalence of some riparians about US technical support, in particular Cambodia&#x27;s rejection of some specific types of assistance. However, the fact remains that &quot;international development agencies have always paid the bills for the Mekong regime,&quot; with European (especially Scandinavian) nations picking up the slack left by the United States, and then (to a lesser extent) Japan.

The Mekong Committee was a forceful advocate for large-scale dams and other projects, primarily preoccupied with facilitating projects. For example, the 1970 Indicative Basin Plan called for 30,000 km2 of irrigation by the year 2000 (up from 2,130 km2) as well as 87 short-term tributary development projects and 17 long-term development projects on the mainstream. The Indicative Basin Plan was crafted largely in response to criticisms of the committee&#x27;s &quot;piecemeal&quot; approach and declining political support of the organization; for example, the committee had received no funds from Thailand, normally the biggest contributor, during the 1970 fiscal year. The completion of all 17 projects was never intended; rather the list was meant to serve as a &quot;menu&quot; for international donors, who were to select 9 or 10 of the projects. While a few of the short-term projects were implemented, none of the long-term projects prevailed in the political climate of the ensuing decade, which included the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Several tributary dams were constructed, but only one—the Nam Ngum Dam (completed 1971), in Laos—outside of Thailand, whose electricity was sold to Thailand. According to Makim, Nam Ngum was the &quot;only truly intergovernmental project achieved&quot; by the committee.

This period was also marked by efforts to expand the jurisdiction and mandate of the committee between 1958 and 1975, which did not receive the consent of all four riparians. However, these efforts culminated, in January 1975, in the adoption of a 35-article &quot;Joint Declaration of Principles for Utilization of the Waters of the Mekong Basin&quot; by the sixty-eighth session of the Mekong Committee, prohibiting the &quot;unilateral appropriation&quot; without &quot;prior approval&quot; and &quot;extra-basin diversion&quot; without unanimous consent. However, no committee sessions were held in 1976 or 1977, as no plenipotentiary members had been appointed by Cambodia, Laos, or Vietnam—all of which experienced regime change in 1975.

===Interim Mekong Committee (1978–1995)===
The rise of the xenophobic and paranoid Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia made Cambodia&#x27;s continued participation unsustainable, so in April 1977 the other three riparians agreed to the &quot;Declaration Concerning the Interim Mekong Committee&quot;, which resulted in the establishment of the Interim Mekong Committee in January 1978. The weakened interim organization was only able to study large-scale projects and implement a few small-scale projects in Thailand and Laos, where the Dutch Government through the IMC funded fisheries and agricultural development projects along the Nam Ngum, as well as port facilities at Keng Kabao near Savannakhet; the institutional role of the organization shifted nonetheless largely to data collection. The 1987 &quot;Revised Indicative Basin Plan&quot;—the high-water mark of the Interim Committee&#x27;s activity—scaled back the ambitions of the 1970 plan, envisioning a cascade of smaller dams along the Mekong&#x27;s mainstream, divided into 29 projects, 26 of which were strictly national in scope. The Revised Indicative Basin Plan can also be seen as laying the groundwork for Cambodia&#x27;s readmission. The Supreme National Council of Cambodia did request readmission in June 1991.

Cambodia&#x27;s readmission was largely a side-show which masked the true issue facing the riparians: that the rapid economic growth experienced in Thailand relative to its neighbors had made even the modest sovereignty limitations imposed by Mekong agreements seem undesirable in Bangkok. Thailand and the other three riparians (led by Vietnam, the most powerful of the remaining three states) were locked in disagreement over whether Cambodia should be readmitted under the terms of the 1957 &quot;Statute&quot; (and more importantly, the 1975 &quot;Joint Declaration&quot;), with Thailand preferring to negotiate an entirely new framework to allow its planned Kong-Chi-Moon Project (and others) to proceed without a Vietnamese veto. Article 10 of the &quot;Joint Declaration&quot;, requiring unanimous consent for all mainstream development and inter-basin diversion proved to be the main sticking point of Cambodia&#x27;s readmission, with Thailand perhaps prepared to walk away from the regime altogether. The conflict came to a head in April 1992 when Thailand forced the executive agent of the committee, Chuck Lankester, to resign and leave the country after barring the secretariat from the March 1992 meeting. This prompted a series of meetings organized by the UNDP (which was terrified that the regime in which it had invested so much might disappear), culminating in the April 1995 &quot;Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin&quot; signed by Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam in Chiang Rai, Thailand, creating the Mekong River Commission (MRC).

Since the dramatic confrontation of 1992, several seemingly overlapping organizations were created, including the Asian Development Bank&#x27;s Greater Mekong Subregion (ADB-GMS, 1992), Japan&#x27;s Forum of Comprehensive Development of Indochina (FCDI, 1993), the Quadripite Economic Cooperation (QEC, 1993), the Association of South East Asian Nations and Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry&#x27;s Working Group on Economic Cooperation in Indochina and Burma (AEM-MITI, 1994), and (almost finalized) Myanmar and Singapore&#x27;s ASEAN-Mekong Basin Development Cooperation (ASEAN-ME, 1996).

===Mekong River Commission (1995–present)===
The MRC has evolved since 1995. Some of the &quot;thorny issues&quot; set aside during the negotiation of the agreement were at least partially resolved by the implementation of subsequent programmes such as the Water Utilization Programme (WUP) agreed to in 1999 and committed to implementation by 2005. The commission&#x27;s hierarchical structure has been repeatedly tweaked, as in July 2000 when the MRC Secretariat was restructured. The 2001 Work Programme has largely come to be viewed as a shift &quot;from a project-oriented focus to an emphasis on better management and preservation of existing resources.&quot; On paper, the Work Programme represents a rejection of the ambitious development schemes embodied by the 1970 and 1987 &quot;Indicative Basin Plans&quot; (calling for no mainstream dams) and a shift to a holistic rather than programmatic approach. In part, these changes represent a response to criticism of the MRC&#x27;s failure to undertake a &quot;regional-scale project&quot; or even a region-level focus.

2001 also saw a major shift in the MRC—at least on paper—when it committed to a role as a &quot;learning organization&quot; with an emphasis on &quot;the livelihoods of the people in the Mekong region.&quot; In the same year its annual report emphasized the importance of &quot;bottoms-up&quot; solutions and the &quot;voice of the people directly affected.&quot; Similarly, the 2001 MRC Hydropower Development Strategy explicitly disavowed the &quot;promotion of specific projects&quot; in favor of &quot;basin-wide issues.&quot; In part, these shifts mark a retreat from past project failures and recognition that the MRC faces multiple, and often more lucrative, competitors in the project arena.

==Governance==
The MRC is governed by its four member countries through the Joint Committee and the council. Members of the Joint Committee are usually senior civil servants heading government departments. There is one member from each country. The Joint Committee meets two to three times a year to approve budgets and strategic plans. Members of the council are cabinet ministers. The Council meets once a year.

Technical and administrative support is provided by the MRC Secretariat. The secretariat is based in Vientiane, Laos, with over 120 staff including scientists, administrators, and technical staff. A chief executive officer manages the secretariat.

In April 2010, the Mekong River Commission convened a summit in Hua Hin, Thailand. All six riparian nations were in attendance, including China, Burma (Myanmar), Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

==Relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Burma==
The Mekong River Commission and its predecessors have never included PR China (which was not a member of the United Nations in 1957) or Burma (which does not significantly rely on or tap the Mekong), whose territory contains the upper Basin of the Mekong. Part of a joint initiative by the US agency for International Development (USAID) and NASA, SERVIR Mekong project, with five countries, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam including Myanmar which aims to tap into the latest technologies to help the Mekong River region protect its vital ecosystem. Although China contributes only 16–18 percent of the Mekong&#x27;s overall water volume, the glacial melt waters of the Tibetan plateau take on increasing importance during the dry season. The ability of upstream nations to undermine downstream cooperation was perhaps best symbolized by an April 1995 ceremonial boat trip from Thailand to Vietnam—to celebrate the signing of the 1995 Agreement—which ran aground mid-river as a result of China filling the reservoir of the Manwan Dam. Although China and Burma became &quot;dialogue partners&quot; of the MRC in 1996 and slowly but steadily escalated their (non-binding) participation in its various forums, it is at present unthinkable that either would join the MRC in the near future.

In April 2002, China began providing daily water level data to the MRC during the flood season. Critics noted that the emphasis on &quot;flood control&quot; rather than dry season flows represented an important omission given the concerns prioritized by the Mekong regime. In July 2003, MRC CEO Joern Kristensen reported that China had agreed to scale back its plans to blast rapids by implementing only phase one (of three) of its Upper Mekong Navigation Improvement Project; however, China&#x27;s future intentions in this area are far from certain. One area in which China has been particularly reticent is in providing information about the operation of its dams, rather than just flow data, including refusing to join emergency meetings in 2004. Only in 2005 did China agreed to hold technical discussions directly with the MRC. On 2 June 2005, at the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Water Resources, MRC CEO Dr. Olivier Cogels and a delegation of the secretariat&#x27;s senior staff made the first official visit to Beijing to hold technical consultations under the framework of cooperation between China and the MRC, within the scope of the Mekong Programme. The delegation identified a number of potential areas of cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Communication, Information and Transport. These discussions resulted in China supplying the MRC (beginning in 2007) with 24-hour water level and 12-hour rainfall data for flood forecasts in exchange for monthly flow data from the MRC Secretariat. The incentives for China to enter into cooperative regimes on the Mekong are substantially reduced by the alternative of the Salween River as a commercial outlet for China&#x27;s Yunnan province, made considerably more attractive by requiring negotiation solely with Burma, rather than with four different riparians. News media and official sources often portray China&#x27;s joining the commission as a panacea for resolving the overdevelopment of the Mekong. However, there is no indication that China&#x27;s joining the MRC would provide downstream riparians with any real capacity to challenge China&#x27;s development plans, given the dramatic power imbalances exhibited by these countries&#x27; relations with China.

The MRC has been hesitant to fully register concerns about Chinese upstream hydro-development. For example, in a letter to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;, MRC CEO Dr. Olivier Cogels in fact argued that Chinese dams would increase the river&#x27;s dry season volume as their purpose was electricity generation and not irrigation. While such dams certainly could increase dry season flows, the only certainty about future Chinese reservoir policies seems to be that they will be crafted outside of downstream cooperation regimes. Public statements from MRC leaders in the same vein as Cogels&#x27; comments have—to some—earned the MRC a reputation of being complicit in allowing &quot;China&#x27;s dam-building machine float downstream.&quot;

<doc id="1276915" wikidata="Q371413" url="?curid=1276915" title="The Big Store">
<text>The Big Store is a 1941 American comedy film directed by Charles Reisner and starring the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo and Chico) that takes place in a large department store. Groucho appears as private detective Wolf J. Flywheel (a character name originating from the Marx-Perrin radio show &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot; in the early 1930s).

&quot;The Big Store&quot; was the last of the five films that the Marx Bros. made under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The Marxes had decided to retire as a team and &quot;The Big Store&quot; was advertised as their farewell film. However, they would return to the screen in &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; (1946) and &quot;Love Happy&quot; (1949).

The film also features singer Tony Martin and Virginia Grey as the love interests and longtime Marx Brothers foil Margaret Dumont in her seventh and final film with the Marxes. The villain is portrayed by Douglass Dumbrille, who had played a similar role in &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937).

==Plot==
Singer Tommy Rogers has recently inherited half ownership of the Phelps department store from his late uncle, Hiram Phelps. The other half of the business is owned by Hiram&#x27;s sister and Tommy&#x27;s aunt, Martha Phelps. Rogers has no interest in running a department store, so he plans to sell his interest in the store to finance a new music conservatory. Mr. Grover, the store manager, plots to kill Rogers before he can sell his share of the business, marry the wealthy Martha and then likely kill her, becoming sole owner of the Phelps department store. Martha is extremely worried about her nephew&#x27;s safety, lest anyone should suspect her of engaging in foul play to take over the store. Against Grover&#x27;s wishes, Martha hires private detective Wolf J. Flywheel as a floorwalker and Tommy&#x27;s bodyguard. Tommy is in love with Joan Sutton, a store employee. Flywheel romances Martha, while Wacky, Fleewheel&#x27;s assistant and driver, is reunited with his brother Ravelli, Tommy&#x27;s best friend. Eventually, Flywheel, Wacky and Ravelli expose Grover and his henchmen and save Tommy.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film has two extended scenes with all three Marx Brothers. One is in the store&#x27;s bed department, with several unusual beds that appear out of the walls and floor. The other takes place near the film&#x27;s climax, when Groucho, Chico and Harpo escape their pursuers in a madcap chase through the store on roller skates. This elaborate sequence took an entire month to shoot and utilized an unusual number of stunt doubles, Mack Sennett-type slapstick stunts and stop-motion photography for a Marx Brothers film. Oddly, a &quot;funny&quot; janitor also appears in this scene as a sort of comic relief.

At two points, Groucho breaks the fourth wall. During the &quot;Sing While You Sell&quot; number, he narrates a fashion show and speaks a few asides, including &quot;This is a bright red dress, but Technicolor is &quot;so&quot; expensive.&quot; At the end of the film, after Grover has been exposed as the villain, Groucho comments, &quot;I told you in the first reel he was a crook!&quot;

==Music==
As with the previous Marx Bros. MGM films, &quot;The Big Store&quot; contains elaborate musical numbers, including the upbeat &quot;Sing While You Sell&quot; led by a singing and dancing Groucho, and &quot;Tenement Symphony&quot; sung by Tony Martin and a children&#x27;s choir. The screenwriting team of Sid Kuller, Ray Golden and Hal Fimberg also supplied the lyrics to Hal Borne&#x27;s original music. An instrumental version of the Arthur Freed/Nacio Herb Brown tune &quot;Sing Before Breakfast&quot; from &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot; is heard during the Groucho-Harpo scene. &quot;The Big Store&quot; is the second Marx film with an instrumental version of &quot;Cosi-Cosa&quot; from &quot;A Night at the Opera,&quot; which can be heard during the bed department scene. It is also heard at the beginning of the racetrack scene in &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;.

* &quot;If It&#x27;s You&quot;: Tony Martin (music and lyrics by Ben Oakland, Artie Shaw and Milton Drake)
* &quot;Sing While You Sell&quot;: Groucho, Six Hits and a Miss, Virginia O&#x27;Brien and Harpo as a drum-beating snake charmer

* &quot;A Whimsical Trio&quot;: Harpo (harp, violin, cello) (by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, using music from a Mozart sonata and a Beethoven minuet)
* &quot;Tenement Symphony&quot;: Tony Martin, onstage choir and orchestra, featuring Chico and Harpo

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;The Big Store&quot; were generally positive, but unenthusiastic.

Theodore Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;if it lacks the continuously harebrained invention of, say, &quot;A Night at the Opera,&quot; the boys are still the most erratic maniacs this side of bars. If one were entirely truthful one would have to admit that the picture has many a dull stretch, that the tricks have been overworked, that the boys are slowing down, etc., etc. But with Marxian adherents—among whom we most decidedly belong—the question is simply, Are the Marx Brothers in it? They are.&quot;

A review in &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;moderate comedy where dull stretches overshadow the several socko laugh sequences during a bumpy unfolding ... Marx Bros. repeat their familiar antics without much variation from previous appearances.&quot;

&quot;Film Daily&quot; suggested that a couple of the chase scenes were &quot;a little lengthy&quot; but still concluded, &quot;A &#x27;laugh clocker&#x27; could run a high total checking this and the preview audience seemed to love it.&quot;

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;not great Marx material, not a film that collectors will exhibit as a sample of this era&#x27;s humor, but again and again the old flash is there.&quot;

&quot;The Big Store&quot; returned a modest profit of $33,000, but was initially the most profitable of the Marxes three final films for MGM.

<text>Jagdwurst (literally &quot;hunting sausage&quot;) is a German cooked sausage made with finely ground pork sausage meat and coarse chunks of lean pork or pork belly. Some recipes also include beef. The meat is usually seasoned with salt and flavoured with spices such as green peppercorns, mace, ginger and coriander. North German styles of &quot;Jagdwurst&quot; often contain mustard seeds, and in the south, pistachio pieces are a common ingredient.

&quot;Jagdwurst&quot; can be eaten cold, for example in sandwiches, or hot, sometimes cut into soup and other hot dishes.

In eastern Germany, fried, sliced &quot;Jagdwurst&quot;, often coated in breadcrumbs, is termed . The dish is essentially a lower-budget schnitzel conceived in harder times and popular in the German Democratic Republic, using sausage instead of lean meat due to its lower price and higher availability. The more traditional, common preparation of jägerschnitzel comprises an escalope of lean pork or veal served with a mushroom sauce, also known as (&#x27;huntsman-style schnitzel&#x27;).

<text>Shalom Shachna ( 1490 or 1510 – 1558) was a rabbi and Talmudist, and Rosh yeshiva of several great Acharonim including Moses Isserles, who was also his son-in-law.

==Biography==
Shachna was a pupil of Jacob Pollak, founder of the method of Talmudic study known as &quot;Pilpul&quot;. In 1515 Shachna established the yeshiva in Lublin, which had the third largest Jewish community in Poland during that period. Shachna became famous as a teacher, and students came to Lublin from all over Europe to study there. The yeshiva became a center of learning of both Talmud and Kabbalah; the Rosh yeshiva received the title of rector and equal rights to those in Polish universities with the permission of the King in 1567. (This, as well as the great scholarship of those who studied there, have led some to refer to Lublin as &quot;the Jewish Oxford&quot;.) Shachna was succeeded as head of Lublin Yeshiva by Solomon Luria (the &quot;Maharshal&quot;).

==Works==
Only one of Shachna&#x27;s writings, the treatise &quot;Pesakim be-Inyan Kiddushin&quot; has been published - Shachna was known for his modesty, and enjoined his son Israel from printing any of his manuscripts.

<text>The West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD, ) is a large arts development in Hong Kong. Designed and planned by Foster and Partners, the district comprises with 17 venues. Major establishments include Xiqu Centre for Chinese opera, the Freespace Centre for contemporary performance, the M+ Museum, and the Hong Kong Palace Museum. As of 2023, the Lyric Theatre and other commercial structures are under construction. It is managed by the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA).

==Location==
The wedge-shaped waterfront site was created from reclaimed land in the 1990s as part of the Airport Core Programme. It lies west of Yau Ma Tei in the Yau Tsim Mong District and is bounded by Canton Road in the east, the Western Harbour Crossing, Austin Road West, and Victoria Harbour.

It is within walking distance of Tsim Sha Tsui (TST), a popular tourist area, and of the Kowloon Station and West Kowloon Terminus complex, which is connected to the Elements commercial centre and national high-speed rail network.

==Venues==
=== Batch 1 ===
====West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre (demolished)====

The West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre was built at the junction of Canton Road and Austin Road West (the present site of Xiqu Centre) in January 2012. It was the first cultural event organised by WKCDA to mark the launch of the design and construction stage of the district. Bamboo theaters were once a staple for honouring and celebrating the Chinese sea goddess Tin Hau and Zhen Jun. The event, which was a combination of traditional Cantonese opera, contemporary visual art installations and film shows in collaboration with the Chinese Artists Association of Hong Kong and involved various renowned visual artists, attracted over 12,000 participants in 7 days. The Bamboo Theatre was initially to be an annual event, but as of 2021 has not been recreated.

==== AXA x WONDERLAND (nursery park)====
Opened in July 2015, the temporary Nursery Park is located at the northwestern part of the site. It features open lawns and a pet zone, and is a testing ground for greenery in the future park. It is also where Freespace Happening, a free outdoor music and arts event, takes place. Since September 2022, it is called AXA x WONDERLAND.

==== M+ Pavilion ====

Designed by VPANG + JET + Lisa Cheung, the M+ Pavilion was used to provide exhibition space for M+ prior to the completion of the main museum building. It was inaugurated with the exhibition &#x27;Nothing&#x27; by Hong Kong artist Tsang Kin-Wah in September 2016. It is now used a multi purpose space hosting various events and exhibitions.

==== Art Park ====
The park includes Freespace and The Lawn. Designed by Dennis Lau &amp; Ng Chun Man Architects &amp; Engineers with West 8 and ACLA, the park was partially opened in 2017 and fully operational by 2018.

==== Xiqu Centre ====

Located on the eastern edge of the district, at the junction of Canton Road and Austin Road, the Xiqu Centre is directly accessible from Kowloon MTR Station, Austin MTR station and West Kowloon Terminus. The building was inspired by traditional Chinese lanterns. Stepping through the main entrance, shaped to resemble parted stage curtains, visitors are led directly into an atrium with a raised podium and space for presenting Chinese traditional theatre. The eight-storey building has a total area of 28,164 sq m and houses a Grand Theatre, accommodating 1,075 seats, a Tea House Theatre, with a capacity of up to 200 seats, eight professional studios and a seminar hall, all specially designed for different types of xiqu-related functions and activities. A unique feature of the venue is the location of the Grand Theatre at the top of the building, which allows for the large open atrium below. It was designed by Revery Architecture (formerly Bing Thom Architects) and Ronald Lu &amp; Partners and opened in January 2019.

==== Freespace ====
Freespace, a centre for contemporary performance, has the largest blackbox theatre in Hong Kong, accommodating up to 900 people, as well as other multi-purpose venues designed for creative exchanges, exhibitions and workshops, as well as professional and private meetings and gatherings. up to is a highly flexible space fully adaptable for small- to medium-sized performances of experimental theatre, dance, parkour multimedia shows and music events, as well as exhibitions. Freespace Livehouse is a small bar and performance space presenting music from Hong Kong and around the world, also hosting workshops, film screenings and cultural events, and free outdoor music in the Art Park. Freespace was designed by Dennis Lau &amp; Ng Chun Man Architects and Engineers (DLN) and opened in 2019.

==== M+ Museum ====

The M+ Museum has three major focuses: visual art, design and architecture, and the moving image. Designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, the museum opened in November 2021.

=== Batch 2 ===
==== Lyric Theatre Complex ====
The Lyric Theatre Complex will be a major performing arts venue in the WKCD, comprising a 1,450-seat theatre, a 600-seat medium theatre and a 250-seat studio theatre. A Resident Company Centre and extensive rehearsal facilities will be situated in the complex as well.

==== Centre for Contemporary Performance ====
The centre will include two Black Boxes.

=== Batch 3 ===
==== Hong Kong Palace Museum ====
On 23 December 2016, Carrie Lam, then chair of the WKCDA, announced in Beijing that a new Hong Kong Palace Museum would be built on the southern part of the land originally slated for the Mega Performance Venue and Exhibition Centre. Occupying around 10,000 square metres, the floor area of the new Palace Museum is estimated at 30,500 square metres, housing two exhibition galleries, activity rooms, a 400-seat lecture theatre, shops and restaurants. The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust donated HK$3.5 billion for the design, construction and exhibition preparation works of the museum. Rocco Design Architects were commissioned to design the building. The museum opened on 3 July 2022 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong.

==== Mega Performance Venue (MPV) and Exhibition Centre ====
The MPV was planned as a performance venue with 15,000 seats. The board of the WKCDA, however, decided not to use the current Nursery Park as the site for the MPV. As of 2021, the Authority was presently considering developing the northern part of the coastal land as a medium-sized multipurpose venue for exhibitions, conventions and performances through privately financed initiatives.

Batch 3 will also accommodate additional projects under the working titles of Musical Theatre, Great Theatre, Music Centre, Medium Theatre, Xiqu Small Theatre and M+ Phase II. Some of these projects will require additional funding approvals and/or subject to review in the future by the WKCDA.

==Temporary usage==
===West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade===

Part of the district&#x27;s site is still used as a temporary promenade, the West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade, opened in 2005 and managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. The promenade can be accessed from the east via Museum Drive or via a pedestrian entrance close to the bus station, to the west of the toll booths. Bicycles are available for hire for riding along a short waterfront cycle track, which will be removed when the site is developed.

== Development and history ==
The project has gone through multiple, well-publicised delays for nearly 20 years. The first phase opened in 2015, while the second phase is expected to be completed in 2026.

In 1996, the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) conducted a survey of visiting tourists, who cited a lack of cultural attractions. The HKTB proposed to LegCo in 1998 that new venues for the arts and cultural events be established. In his 1998 Policy Address, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa proposed the establishment of the West Kowloon Cultural District, endeavouring to develop Hong Kong as a cultural hub for Asia.

In April 2001, an international design competition was launched. Ten members of the judging panel selected a canopy design submitted by Foster and Partners as the winner under eight aspects. Leslie E. Robertson Associates were appointed as the structural engineering firm. However, the design was scrapped in 2005 due to intense public criticism with regard to financing models, the involvement of property developers, lack of planning, and the design itself. In 2006, the government established consultative committees to formulate a report on what facilities to offer and how they would be managed. In 2007, a three-month public consultation was carried out again, the early stages of which were completed in December 2007.

===Invitation for proposals===
In September 2003, the government announced an Invitation For Proposals for the Development of the district. While it required the provision of certain facilities, proponents were allowed considerable freedom, which meant that developers could sell residential and commercial space for profit. The requirements were:

* Three theatres with at least 400, 800 and 2,000, seats respectively
*A performance venue with at least 10,000 seats
*A cluster of four museums of at least 
*An art exhibition centre of at least 
*A water amphitheater
*At least four piazzas
*A canopy covering at least 55% of the development area

Three proposals, submitted by Dynamic Star International Limited, Sunny Development Limited and World City Culture Park Limited, were consulted on with the public from December 2004 to June 2005.

===First public consultation===
The executive summary of the consultation report showed that the single-package development approach, the large canopy, government supervision of the district and the concept of the project itself were among most questioned in the open question section of the consultation form. The report noted there was fear that the project could evolve into an ordinary property development project, common in Hong Kong. Over half of the written submissions were opposed to the canopy.

As the government renewed conditions for the development, the shortlisted proponents failed to renew their proposals and Chief Secretary Rafael Hui Si-yan said the much-criticised giant canopy – a centrepiece of the winning design by Foster and Partners – would be scrapped.

===Consultative Committee and Public Engagement===
The government appointed members to the Consultative Committee on the Core Arts and Cultural Facilities (CACF) of WKCD in April 2006 and the committee was scheduled to last until June 2007. It re-examined and re-confirmed the need for the CACF as defined in the Invitation for Proposals issued in September 2003. A Stage 1 Public Engagement Exercise was conducted from October 2009 to January 2010. Public forums and focus group meetings were held to understand the views and needs of the stakeholders and the public. Around 66 public engagement events were held. A Stage 2 Public Engagement Exercise followed, which sought to obtain feedback on the concept plans prepared by three planning teams, which incorporated public views learnt in Stage 1 into their conceptual plans.

===Master Plan===
The three conceptual plans were unveiled on 20 August 2010 by the WKCDA:
*&quot;City Park&quot;, prepared by Foster and Partners, led by Lord Norman Foster
*&quot;Cultural Connect, Key to Sustained Vitality&quot;, prepared by Rocco Design Architects Limited, led by Rocco Yim
*&quot;Project for a New Dimension&quot;, prepared by Office for Metropolitan Architecture, led by Rem Koolhaas

The Stage 2 Public Engagement exercise lasted three months and ran until November 2010.

On 4 March 2011, Foster and Partners&#x27; plan, &quot;City Park&quot;, was selected as the master plan out of the three entries. Ronald Arculli, then head of the WKCDA, as well as of the selection board, said the master plan would be submitted to the Town Planning Board at the end of 2011. Construction could start as soon as the fourth quarter of 2012 with the first phase of the WKCD finished by the end of 2015. The plan was originally estimated to cost HK$21.6 billion. In October 2011, the government revised its cost estimates upwards, to over HK$29 billion.

The WKCD&#x27;s Stage 3 Public Engagement Exercise began in September 2011 at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre. The focal point of the exhibition was a giant 1:250 physical model of the hub. A digital 3D model, photo montages and panels displaying key information and features were also presented. The plan – with public consultation running until 30 October – eventually went to the Town Planning Board, which subsequently gave the go-ahead by the end of next year.

==West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA)==
The WKCD Authority was established under the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority Ordinance, Cap 601 to develop the West Kowloon Cultural district. It came into action on 11 July 2008. The authority is made up of a board, committees and executive board directors.

A board of directors was appointed in October 2008. Its chairman was former Chief Secretary Henry Tang Ying-yen, subsequent chairperson of the WKCDA. While government officials and experts were recruited to aid the authority operation temporarily, executives and managers were recruited to independently manage the operation.

The authority has an executive team of seven. Its first executive director, Angus Cheng Siu-chuen, a former executive at Hong Kong Disneyland, was appointed in June 2009 but resigned for personal reasons less than two weeks after taking up the post. Project Director Augustine Ng Wah-keung subsequently led the project on a provisional basis. On 24 March 2010, Graham Sheffield, formerly artistic director of the Barbican Centre, was appointed CEO of the authority on a three-year, HK$3.5 million-a-year contract. However, on 7 January 2011, he, too, suddenly resigned for &quot;health reasons,&quot; just five months into the job. A recruitment exercise to replace Sheffield as CEO was subsequently launched, though the impact of these two top-level resignations worried critics. A member of the Legislative Council&#x27;s home affairs panel, Tanya Chan, expressed fear at the time that candidates for the job could be deterred by the apparent problems with the project, ostensibly delaying the project until 2020.

On 27 May 2011, Michael Lynch, former Chief Executive of the Southbank Centre, was appointed CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority by Tang. Lynch resigned in 2015, citing family reasons, and was replaced by Duncan Pescod. A popular figure, Pescod was forced to resign from the WKCDA in 2020, not long before his term was due to end. Longtime bureaucrat Betty Fung Ching Suk-yee was subsequently appointed to the post in June 2021, assuming her duties on 15 October 2021 for a term of three years.

<doc id="1276935" wikidata="Q3179055" url="?curid=1276935" title="Jimmy Herring">
<text>Jimmy Herring (born January 22, 1962) is an American guitarist, known as the lead guitarist for the band Widespread Panic since 2006. He is a founding member of Aquarium Rescue Unit and Jazz Is Dead and has played with The Allman Brothers Band, Project Z, Derek Trucks Band, Phil Lesh and Friends, and The Dead.

==Career==
A native of Fayetteville, North Carolina, Herring is the son of a high school English teacher and a Superior Court judge. The youngest of three brothers, he attended Terry Sanford High School in Fayetteville. Although he played saxophone in the high school band, he became known for his talent on guitar, which he had begun playing at age 13. Herring had a Telecaster guitar with a Stratocaster neck, in the same style as one of his biggest influences, Steve Morse of the Dixie Dregs. After high school he formed the Paradox, a cover band that played mostly jazz fusion and songs by the Dixie Dregs, Al Di Meola, and Chuck Mangione. The band&#x27;s horn section included Wayne Rigsby and Charles Humphries on trumpet and Herring on saxophone. After graduating from high school, in 1980, Herring attended a summer session at the Berklee College of Music. In addition, he is a graduate of The Guitar Institute of Technology in Hollywood, California.

Herring was the lead guitarist for the jam band Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit. Formed in Atlanta in 1989, its members include Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and Leftover Salmon drummer Jeff Sipe. He was invited to participate on the H.O.R.D.E. tour with Aquarium Rescue Unit in 1992 and 1993 and was offered the lead guitar job in the Allman Brothers Band after Dickey Betts was arrested after a show in Saratoga Springs, New York on July 30, 1993. Herring declined to take the position full-time. Bruce Hampton left Aquarium Rescue Unit in 1994, citing time pressure as his reason. Herring and other members continued to tour in early 1997 until drummer Jeff Sipe departed for Leftover Salmon.

In 1998 and 1999 Herring went on tour as Jazz Is Dead with bassist Alphonso Johnson, keyboardist T Lavitz, and drummer Billy Cobham. The band&#x27;s albums included jazz rock versions of songs by the Grateful Dead. Herring also appeared on the album &quot;Out of the Madness&quot; by The Derek Trucks Band. He went on tour with the Allman Brothers Band in 2000, then joined Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead in Phil Lesh and Friends.

In 2002, Herring joined The Other Ones, a band which included four former members of the Grateful Dead — Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzmann. Herring continued to play with the group, now renamed The Dead, in 2003 and 2004.

In 2005, he also toured with the jazz, funk, and occasionally bluegrass-oriented band The Codetalkers, which featured Herring on guitar with his previous bandmate Col. Bruce Hampton on vocals, harmonica, and guitar. This band also allowed Herring to expand a musical friendship with Codetalkers&#x27; front man Bobby Lee Rodgers, with whom Herring formed a new band in the spring of 2006 (tentatively dubbed Herring, Rodgers, and Sipe). 2005 also marked the release of the &quot;Lincoln Memorial&quot; disc from Project Z, of which Jimmy is a founding member. In January 2005, Herring appeared on the Jam Cruise 3 stage with several acts, including Colonel Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade.

Herring left Phil Lesh and Friends in November, 2005. On August 3, 2006, Widespread Panic announced Herring would be taking over the lead guitar spot in the band after the departure of George McConnell. Also in 2006, Herring and an almost complete original lineup of Aquarium Rescue Unit reunited as Col. Bruce Hampton and The Aquarium Rescue Unit featuring Oteil Burbridge, Jimmy Herring, Col. Bruce Hampton and Jeff Sipe with Bobby Lee Rodgers sitting in.

In 2006, Jimmy officially became a member of Widespread Panic as their new lead guitar player. His first performance with the group was at Radio City Music Hall.

In 2008, Herring released &quot;Lifeboat&quot;, his first official solo album, on Abstract Logix. The material consists primarily of instrumental jazz-rock fusion, and features a rotating lineup of long-time Herring collaborators, including Oteil and brother Kofi Burbridge, Jeff Sipe, alto and soprano saxophonist Greg Osby, and others, including two songs featuring Derek Trucks. The album was met with generally positive reviews.

On February 7, 2009, Herring, along with Steve Gorman (The Black Crowes), guitarist Audley Freed (Jakob Dylan, ex-Crowes, Blue Floyd) and bassist-singer Nick Govrik, made their live debut of Trigger Hippy at the Cox Capitol Theater in Macon, Georgia.

On August 21, 2012, Jimmy Herring released &quot;Subject to Change Without Notice&quot;, his second solo album on Abstract Logix. The album received rave reviews and was produced by John Keane who is well known for producing albums for Widespread Panic, R.E.M, The Indigo Girls among others. 
Jimmy Herring was also on the cover of Guitar Player Magazine the very same year. He toured the album extensively in the United States during the Fall of 2012 with Jeff Sipe, Neal Fountain and Matt Slocum.

In 2013, Jimmy Herring, Wayne Krantz, Michael Landau, Etienne Mbappe and Keith Carlock started a band called The Ringers. The idea of this five musicians to form this unique band came from Abstract Logix Founder and Producer Souvik Dutta. They went to perform five concerts in USA to a wonderful response.

The Ringers returned in 2014 performing fourteen concerts in January and February, this time with drummer Gary Novak.

In 2017, Jimmy Herring formed The Invisible Whip with Jeff Sipe on drums, Jason Crosby on violin and Rhodes, Kevin Scott on bass, Matt Slocum on Organ. They performed 50 shows, which includes co-billing with John McLaughlin on his farewell American Tour.

In 2018, Abstract Logix released &quot;Live in San Francisco&quot;, a live album from John McLaughlin and Jimmy Herring&#x27;s co-bill tour from the year prior.

On May 26, 2018, Jimmy Herring played guitar with The Dave Matthews Band in Atlanta, Georgia. He joined the band on stage for the songs Satellite and #41 where he again displayed his smooth playing style and warmth on the guitar.

In 2019, Jimmy Herring formed The 5 of 7, featuring Kevin Scott on bass, Matt Slocum on keys, Darren Stanley on drums and Rick Lollar on voice and guitar.

On July 21, 2024, Widespread Panic announced on social media that Herring had been diagnosed with stage 1 tonsil cancer.

==Equipment==
One of Herring&#x27;s primary guitars is a white PRS NF3 model guitar with a maple neck, stock electronics, mint green pickguard and Dunlop 6000 frets. As of 2019, for the Jimmy Herring and the 5 of 7 projects, Herring has primarily used a natural finished PRS NF3 model guitar that was custom made for him by Paul Reed Smith. He has also been known to use a modified American Standard Fender Stratocaster. The Stratocaster is equipped with two Lollar Imperial humbuckers. The fingerboard radius has been flattened out to 20&quot; and has Dunlop 6000 fret wire, which are the tallest and widest guitar frets manufactured today.
Herring also uses a 1969 Stratocaster as well as several other PRS guitars (including a hollowbody) and has played a 1970 Gibson SG given as a gift from Derek Trucks. Although he has long used effects sparingly, his 2005 Codetalkers rig saw him sport an Ernie Ball volume pedal and an H&amp;K Tube Factor. He has expanded his effects pedals when playing Dead related music, and sported a TC Electronic M-One, and a Mutron with both The Dead and Phil Lesh and Friends. He splits the signal off at the speaker output of his amp and uses that signal to drive a separate solid state amp just for reverb. The reverb level is controlled with a volume pedal. As of early 2014, the reverb unit is an Eventide Space Reverb. Amps are chosen for specific venues and projects. Most common now are a slightly modified blackface Super Reverb head, slightly modified blackface Pro Reverb, slightly modified blackface Twin Reverb, stock blond/black Bassman head. Depending on the amp, the speakers are either Tone Tubby or ElectroVoice. In the last few years, Jimmy has also employed amps from Homestead and Germino, and guitars from PRS, an NF3, a Custom 22 with an extra volume knob for the neck pickup, a 20th PS Anniversary, and a 594. The NF3 and Custom 22 are the most prevalent. A Stratocaster with 3 single coils is sometimes used as well.

===With Widespread Panic===
At the beginning of Herring&#x27;s tenure with Widespread Panic he was using his favorite guitar, a 3-color sunburst Stratocaster built by his friend Gene Baker at the Fender Custom Shop, equipped with two Seymour Duncan ‘59 reissue humbuckers, with a 1973 Marshall Superlead 100 watt amp accompanied by a 4x12 Marshall stereo and a ‘67 blackface Fender Super Reverb as amplifiers. During the remainder of the Fall 2006 tour Herring continued to use his custom shop Strat. At the beginning of Fall 2007, Herring began using Fuchs Overdrive Supreme amplifiers. Into 2009 Herring continued to use Fuchs amps, but now used a Tripledrive Supreme 100 watt head, and occasionally an Overdrive Supreme 100 watt head. He uses a Tone Tubby 4x12 cab and two 2x12 Hard Truckers speaker cabs with Alnico tone tubby speakers. He also uses a Fractal Audio Axe-Fx for effects, mainly reverb and delay sounds. In 2011 he continues to use Fuchs as his main amplifier. His main guitars are the White American Standard Stratocaster with Lollar Imperial humbuckers and an MIJ &#x27;62 Telecaster Custom reissue with Lollar Vintage T pickups.

<doc id="1276939" wikidata="Q282651" url="?curid=1276939" title="Islam in Mauritania">
<text>Virtually all Mauritanians are Sunni Muslims. They adhere to the Maliki madhhab, one of the four Sunni schools of law. Since independence in 1960, Mauritania has been an Islamic republic. The Constitutional Charter of 1985 declares Islam the state religion and sharia the law of the land. 

==History==
The Umayyads were the first Arab Muslims to enter Mauritania. During the Islamic conquests, they made incursions into Mauritania and were present in the region by the end of the 7th century. Many Berber tribes in Mauritania fled the arrival of the Arabs to the Gao region in Mali. 

It was not until the nineteenth century that the brotherhoods (Sufism and tariqa) assumed importance when they attempted to make religion a force for expanding identities and loyalties beyond the limits of kinship. The relative peace brought to the area by French administration and the growing resentment of colonial rule contributed to the rapid rise in the power and influence of the brotherhoods. In recent decades, these orders have opposed tribalism and have been an indispensable element in the growth of nationalist sentiment. Since the Ahmadiyya Islamic movement has a large presence in West Africa, the African Muslim Congress met in Mauritania in 1976 to call upon African nations to regard Ahmadi Muslims as apostates, though with little success. 

==Sufi brotherhoods==
In the 1980s, two brotherhoods (tariqa), the Qadiriyyah and the Tijaniyyah, accounted for nearly all the brotherhood membership in Mauritania. The Qadiriyyah and Tijaniyyah were essentially parallel &quot;ways,&quot; differing primarily in their methods of reciting the litanies. Their Islamic doctrines and their religious obligations were basically similar. 

Two smaller brotherhoods also existed — the Shadhiliyyah, centered in Boumdeït in Assaba Region, and the Goudfiya, found in the regions of Tagant, Adrar, Hodh ech Chargui, and Hodh el Gharbi.

<text>Anatomy () is a 2000 German horror film written and directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky that stars Franka Potente. The film became the highest-grossing German-language movie in 2000. Columbia Pictures released the film&#x27;s English-dubbed version in the United States theatrically. However, the dubbed version underperformed at the United States box office.

A sequel, &quot;Anatomy 2&quot; (&quot;Anatomie 2&quot;), was released in 2003.

==Plot==
Medical student Paula Henning wins a place in a summer course at the University of Heidelberg, where her grandfather had been a renowned professor. During one of her classes on anatomy, the body of David, a young man whom Paula encountered on her train to Heidelberg, turns up on her dissection table. Her instructor, Professor Grombek, humiliates her by daring her to dissect the heart. Paula finds that David&#x27;s body bears strange incisions and decides to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death. As she proceeds to cut a sample for an independent test, she is intrigued to find a triple &quot;A&quot; mark near David&#x27;s ankle. She is then startled by the school&#x27;s mortuary attendant, who wants to know if Grombek is aware of her investigation.

Paula finds clues pointing to an ancient secret society, the Anti-Hippocratic Society, which performs gruesome experiments on living people who they deem undesirable. She also comes across research about the rituals that they perform on transgressors of their rules or those who inquire too much. One night, Paula sits on her bed and realizes that it has been soaked in blood, with candles lit underneath, as a sign of warning from the Society. She then attacks a figure that enters her room, but it turns out to be her friend Hein, who is seeking consolation over his recent breakup from his girlfriend Gretchen. While they talk, Paula&#x27;s boyfriend Casper stops by and storms off when he sees that she is not alone. Hein leaves, apparently more at peace.

As Gretchen and her new boyfriend Phil prepare to have sex in one of the morgue halls, Hein murders Phil in a jealous rage. He then injects Gretchen with a blood-coagulating drug, telling her that he will preserve her body. He is so absorbed in the work that he falls asleep without having disposed of Phil&#x27;s body. Hein hides it in the morgue and removes the head to prevent identification. The next day, when Paula tries to share her findings about the Society, Hein menacingly tells her that it is dangerous to know too much. Grombek reveals that Paula&#x27;s grandfather was a member of the Society, and that the drug which he became famous for developing was the result of his experiments in Nazi concentration camps. Paula flees to the hospital to confront her grandfather but is told that he has died.

At the assembly of the Society, Hein expresses no remorse for the murders and defiantly accepts their punishment, slashing himself three times in the face. Grombek takes responsibility for the killings and leaves to call the authorities to arrest Hein. Later, while Paula destroys the diplomas granted to her grandfather, a crazed Hein kills Grombek in his house. Paula gets back to the school but is trapped by Hein and his accomplice, Ludwig. While they are preparing her for preservation, Paula&#x27;s bindings are partially cut by Casper. She gets loose, poisons Ludwig, and runs away until Hein strikes a high voltage cable and dies. Casper and Paula then escape together.

In a mid-credits scene, two of Paula&#x27;s classmates praise Hein&#x27;s abilities in dissection and preservation, discuss Grombek&#x27;s imminent replacement, and how they will keep a low profile in their respective practices while experimenting for the Anti-Hippocratic Society.

<text>The Anton Bruckner Private University (in German &quot;Anton Bruckner Privatuniversität&quot;, common short form is &quot;Bruckner University&quot;) is one of five Austrian Universities for Music, Drama and Dance, and one of four universities in Linz, the European Capital of Culture 2009. 850 students from all parts of the 
world study here. They are taught by 200 professors and teaching staff, 
who are internationally recognised artists, academics and teachers. More than 30% of the students and instructors come from abroad. The university was granted accredited private university status in 2004, as part of the Austrian Private Universities Conference, (its name from 1932 to 2004 was &quot;Bruckner Conservatory Linz&quot;, but the roots of the institution go back to 1823 or even to 1799). 

The cultural landscape of Upper Austria sets an example in music 
education all over Europe. The Upper Austrian Provincial Government 
gives particular support to artistic education, which is why – compared 
with similar institutions – tuition fees here are extremely moderate.

The university is named after the Austrian composer Anton Bruckner (1824–1896).

The ABPU is a university for music, drama and dance. The artistic work 
of the university is focussed on performing, pedagogy and research in 
each of these fields, with an equal emphasis on artistic communication, 
development and outreach.

== History ==
Even though the Anton Bruckner Private University has only been 
known under this name for a short time, musical education in Linz has a 
tradition stretching back more than 200 years. As early as 1799 the city
musical director Franz Xaver Glöggl, a close friend of Michael Haydn, 
Mozart and Beethoven, founded the first music school in Linz. Then in 
1823 the newly founded Linz Musical Society set up a singing school – 
the real precursor of the Anton Bruckner Private University.

The attempt to persuade &quot;Anton Bruckner&quot; to become director 
of the Music School in 1863 was unsuccessful. But another important name
– the Bruckner biographer and former secretary to Franz Liszt, August Göllerich,
- was in charge of the newly strengthened institute from 1896 to 1923. 
And in 1923 the name of Bruckner was finally established with the 
upgrading of the Music School to the Bruckner Conservatory Linz – now 
renamed the Anton Bruckner Private University.

The original main function of the forerunner institute, which was
to raise the quality of musical life in Linz by improving the training 
of amateur musicians, was taken over by the Linz Music School in 1950. 
From that time on the Bruckner Conservatory established itself 
progressively as a training ground for professional musicians. This 
development was carried through by the directors &quot;Carl Steiner&quot; (1945–1958), &quot;Wilhelm Jerger&quot; (1958–1973), &quot;Gerhard Dallinger&quot; (1973–1990), &quot;Hans Maria Kneihs&quot; (1990–1995) und &quot;Reinhart von Gutzeit&quot; (from 1995 to 2006), &quot;Univ. Prof. Anton Voigt&quot; (acting rector from 2006 to 2007), and &quot;Dr. Marianne Betz&quot; (2007–2012). In autumn 2012 the rectorship of the university was taken over by &quot;Ursula Brandstätter&quot;.

The Anton Bruckner Private 
University now offers twenty two separate branches of study and three 
university courses in the fields of classical music, jazz, drama and 
contemporary dance. Students may study for the degrees Bachelor of Arts 
or Master of Arts, which are on a par with those of other European 
universities and Arts Academies.

== Computer music studio ==
The Computer Music Studio offers lectures and courses in the field of 
music and media technology, media composition and computer music, and 
the range of subjects it offers is closely integrated with those of the 
Institute DKM – Composition, Conducting and the Theory of Music – and 
JIM, the Institute for Jazz and improvised Music.

History:

The Computer Music Studio was founded in 1995 
as the SAMT by DI Adelhard Roidinger and the Rector of the Bruckner 
Conservatory, Hans Maria Kneihs in the buildings of the Software Park 
Hagenberg. Since 2008 the University Studio, as it became, has been 
under the direction of Weixler, Andreas

<doc id="1276957" wikidata="Q1586134" url="?curid=1276957" title="Royal St George's Golf Club">
<text>The Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club located in Sandwich, Kent, England, is a golf club in the United Kingdom and one of the courses on The Open Championship rotation and is the only Open rota golf course to be located in South East England. It has hosted 15 Open championships, the first in 1894 when it became the first club outside Scotland to host the championship. Past champions include Collin Morikawa, Darren Clarke, Ben Curtis, Greg Norman, Sandy Lyle, Bill Rogers, Bobby Locke, Reg Whitcombe, Henry Cotton, Walter Hagen (on two occasions), Harry Vardon (on two occasions), Jack White and John Henry Taylor. It has also hosted The Amateur Championship on 14 occasions.

The club was founded by the surgeon Laidlaw Purves in 1887 in a setting of wild duneland. Many holes feature blind or partially blind shots, although the unfairness element has been reduced somewhat, after several 20th century modifications. The course also possesses the deepest bunker in championship golf, located on its fourth hole.

The club&#x27;s Challenge Cup dates from 1888 and is one of the oldest amateur events in golf. It has been contested annually over 36 holes except during the war years. A 19-year-old Jack Nicklaus won the tournament in 1959 shortly before going on to win the first of his two U.S. Amateur titles.

Author Ian Fleming used the Royal St George&#x27;s course under the name &quot;Royal St. Marks&quot; in his 1959 novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. When he died, Fleming was the Captain-elect of the club.

==Environmental awareness==
Royal St George&#x27;s is situated on the same stretch of coastline as Royal Cinque Ports Club and neighbouring Prince&#x27;s Golf Club, both former Open Championship venues.

The course has been involved in a research informed study undertaken by Dr Graham Earl since 2011, on behalf of Natural England and Canterbury Christ Church University.

The intensive study undertaken between 2011 – 2015 at Sandwich Bay, incorporated all three links golf courses located at Sandwich Bay, including Royal Cinque Ports golf club and Princes golf club. These courses were involved in an Eco-hydrological study, focusing upon the chemical composition of the groundwater, historical analysis of vegetation composition and management trials looking at site-specific management regimes which encourage native sward development.

Management trials indicated that burning as a management regime promoted an increase in native swards. A combination of the research informed outcomes and enthusiasm for the study by Head Greenkeeper Paul Larsen, has helped to revert in a positive way the SSSI status at Royal St Georges golf club, in an unprecedented three-year period.

This burning management regime provides a fast quick burn, therefore not affecting the rooting zone, (in particular the rare orchids which reside predominantly at Sandwich Bay), but does remove the thatch layer removing generalist competitive plant/grass species. The burning treatment, which can be viewed between October and February, was undertaken to reduce the sward thatch and encourage native grey dune plant species and has been very successful. The site now hosts one of the largest abundance of orchids in a single site, managed for amenity.

==The Open Championship==
Royal St George&#x27;s has hosted The Open Championship on 15 occasions since 1894.

From 11 January 1947 an additional &quot;omnibus&quot; edition repeated all of the week&#x27;s programmes each Saturday morning between 11.00 and 12.00. In all, 711 episodes were produced and the serial achieved a peak audience of 20 million. Its end was marked by a leading article in &quot;The Times&quot;.

The serial followed the adventures of ex-commando Captain Richard Barton MC (Noel Johnson, later Duncan Carse and Gordon Davies) who, with his mates Jock Anderson (Alex McCrindle) and Snowey White (John Mann), solved all sorts of crimes, escaped from dangerous situations, and saved the nation from disaster time and time again.

The series was replaced from time to time by one about the adventures of an explorer. One episode was entitled &quot;Plague on the Plateau&quot;.

Beginning in 1948, the Hammer film company made three &quot;Dick Barton&quot; films and, long after the radio series had been replaced by &quot;The Archers&quot;, Southern Television made a television version in 1979. &quot;Dick Barton&quot; has also been adapted into a tongue-in-cheek stage play and a spoof radio comedy. Each version has featured the originals&#x27; memorable signature tune, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Galop&quot; by Charles Williams.

=== Stories ===
===Style===
The series was devised by producer Norman Collins. The scripts were written by Edward J. Mason, Geoffrey Webb and Produced and directed by Raymond Raikes. The programme gave rise to a popular catchphrase of the late 1940s &quot;With one bound, Dick was free!&quot; which made light of the fact that no matter how dangerous the cliffhanging situation Dick found himself in every evening, he would always escape easily.

Early ideas for the character&#x27;s name included &quot;Bill Barton&quot; and &quot;Rex Drake&quot;. However, the production team finally settled on the more dynamic Dick Barton. After the series had been on the air for some time, the BBC (conscious that the biggest audience for the programme was schoolboys) wrote a strict code of what Dick and his chums could and couldn&#x27;t do, one clause famously stating &quot;Sex plays no part in his adventures.&quot;

===Cancellation===
In 1951 &quot;The Archers&quot; was first broadcast at 11.45 am on the Light Programme. BBC management, led by drama head Val Gielgud, had never felt comfortable with the sensationalism of &quot;Dick Barton&quot;. &quot;The Archers&quot;, which they considered more &#x27;suitable&#x27;, took &quot;Dick Barton&quot; place in the schedules from Easter 1951.

===Revivals===
In 1972 as part of the BBC&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, the BBC broadcast a new, abridged, 10-episode version of the first Barton serial - &quot;The Secret Weapon&quot;. The cast included many members of the original cast, including Noel Johnson, John Mann, William Fox, Alex McCrindle, and Margaret Robertson.

From October 1997 to May 1998, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a six-part sequel/pastiche called &quot;Richard Barton: General Practitioner!&quot;, in which Dick Barton&#x27;s son Richard is a country doctor caring for his apparently senile father, who retreats into fantasies based on his past adventures, believing that there are devilish enemies lurking around him. The series was written by Edward Mason&#x27;s son Lol Mason, and featured Moray Watson as old Dick Barton, Robert Bathurst as his son Richard, Matilda Ziegler as Richard&#x27;s wife Sally, Julian Dutton as young Dick Barton and Iain Cuthbertson as Jock Anderson. The series was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2015 and again in 2019.

In 2009, BBC Audiobooks released &quot;Dick Barton and the Mystery of the Missing Formula&quot; (), a reading of a novel based on the radio serials written by Mike Dorrell and read by Toby Stephens.

The BBC produced a completely new live recording of an original 1951 Dick Barton serial in June 2013, starring Tim Bentinck and Terry Molloy.

==Films==
Beginning in 1948, the Hammer film company made three Dick Barton films, which were intended to be the beginning of a long-running series. Don Stannard, the star, was killed in a car crash in 1949, and Hammer decided to discontinue the series after the production of only three films. Hammer shelved plans to film the next Dick Barton film, &quot;Dick Barton in Africa&quot; written by John Gilling.

* &quot;Dick Barton Strikes Back&quot; (1949)
* &quot;Dick Barton at Bay&quot; (1950)

==Television==
In 1979, Southern Television, one of the smaller ITV Network Companies, made a series of &quot;Dick Barton - Special Agent&quot; which ran in an early evening slot on the ITV Network.

Like the original, it ran in 15-minute segments and was again accompanied by the familiar theme tune, the titles playing against an animated dagger and target motif. The production was blighted by financial troubles, though, and some critics said it was a mistake to try to resurrect the character.

The cast of the show was Tony Vogel as Dick Barton, Anthony Heaton as Snowey White, James Cosmo as Jock Anderson and John Gatrell as Sir Richard Marley. The 32x15 minutes episodes were transmitted by most of the ITV network on Saturdays and Sundays between January and April 1979. Southern, however, screened the show across consecutive nights from Mondays through to Thursday in the radio series&#x27;s original timeslot of 6.45 to 7.00pm.

* Adventure One written by Clive Exton, in ten parts. Demobbed after six years in the army, old friend Sir Richard Marley asks Barton to look into the disappearance of his daughter Virginia (Fiona Fullerton) and son Rex (Kevan Sheehan). They come up against master criminal, Melganik played by John G. Heller.
* Adventure Two written by Julian Bond, in eight parts. At a late night celebration at the &quot;Blue Parrot&quot;, Barton and his colleagues rescue a young girl, Lucy Cameron (Debbie Farrington) from being attacked. She tells them that her father, George Cameron (Colin Rix) has been kidnapped by the evil Muller (Guy Deghy) who is after the deadly poison he has developed.
* Adventure Three written by Clive Exton, in six parts. Celebrating from the last adventure, Dick&#x27;s Aunt Agatha (Stella Kemball) rings up and tells him that her house has vanished. A further phone call from Sir Richard Marley reveals that scientist, Harold Jenkins (Peter Godfrey) has perfected his ultimate weapon and Barton and comrades soon find themselves up against Melganik again.
* Adventure Four written by Julian Bond, in eight parts. Dandy Parkes (Terence Seward), a middle-aged playboy and Amanda Aston (Marsha Fitzalan), wife of a respected Whitehall official are threatened by the Drew Brothers (Ernie Drew by Bernard Kay).

The complete series was released on DVD in March 2009, and in 2010 re-runs of &quot;Dick Barton&quot; were shown on the British satellite television channel Film 24. By 2016 it had reappeared on Talking Pictures TV.

==CD releases==
The BBC&#x27;s 1972 remake of the very first Dick Barton serial has been available to buy on BBC CD and tape for many years. For some time, this was the only Dick Barton radio material that was commercially available, having been recovered from a recording made by a member of the public, but this has now changed.

In February 2011, BBC Radio 4 and a number of national newspapers reported that 338 episodes of Dick Barton recorded in the late 1940s had been recovered from the NFSA [National Film and Sound Archive] in Australia; these re-recordings, using the original BBC scripts and music cues, starred Douglas Kelly as Barton with Moira Carleton, Clifford Cowley, Richard Davies, William Lloyd and Patricia Kennedy. BBC Worldwide&#x27;s audio arm have released a number of these on CD.

The Dick Barton radio series was later relaunched in the UK on BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly BBC Radio 7) and further Dick Barton CDs have been announced by AudioGO (using the NFSA recordings).

The BBC produced a completely new live recording of an original 1951 Dick Barton serial in June 2013, starring Tim Bentinck and Terry Molloy.

<text>Karol Libelt (8 April 1807, Poznań, South Prussia – 9 June 1875, Brdowo) was a Polish philosopher, writer, political and social activist, social worker and liberal, nationalist politician, and president of the Poznań Society of Friends of Learning.

==Life and work==
Libelt took part in the failed November Uprising against Russia in 1830, and was imprisoned for nine months at Magdeburg. Since 1839 he became the head of a secret committee started to organise yet another uprising against the partitioning powers, which was nicknamed the &quot;Libelt Committee&quot; - &quot;Komitet Libelt&quot;). He was sentenced by the Prussian authorities to 20 years of imprisonment in a fortress for taking part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1846). However, he was amnestied in 1848 and returned to Posen (Poznań), where he took part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1848) and joined various organisations supporting the independence of Poland (Polish National Committee and Revolutionary Committee). During the Spring of Nations he was elected as one of the members of the Frankfurt Parliament; he also took part in the Slavic Congress in Prague in June 1848.

In 1849 he was elected a member of the Prussian parliament and became the director of the liberal &quot;Dziennik Polski&quot; (Polish Daily). The following year Libelt began to establish various scientific and social organisations in Greater Poland, including the Society of Friends of the Sciences in Posen (Poznań), which became a &quot;de facto&quot; university. Between 1868 and 1875 he headed the Society and gave lectures in aesthetics. In 1873, he was elected to the Prussian Lower House.

In his philosophical works, Libelt described the so-called Polish messianism, or a belief that the history of the world would be redeemed by the Polish people, who gained moral excellence because of the suffering of their fatherland. He believed in existence of a super-rational cognitive power, visible through art. He is known internationally mainly because of the word intelligentsia popularized by him in one of his books (&quot;Filozofia i krytyka&quot; - &quot;Philosophy and Critics&quot;).

==Writings==
* &quot;Filozofia i krytyka&quot;, Hegelian in tendency (1845–50)
* &quot;Estetyka&quot; (1851)
* &quot;Umnictevo&quot;, a system of ethics (1857)
* &quot;Dziela&quot; (1875)

<doc id="1276990" wikidata="Q16148365" url="?curid=1276990" title="Christmas by medium">
<text>Christmas themes have long been an inspiration to artists and writers. A prominent aspect of Christian media, the topic first appeared in literature and in music. Filmmakers have picked up on this wealth of material, with both adaptations of Christmas novels, in the forms of Christmas films, Santa Claus films, and Christmas television specials.

It also includes animation, comics, and children&#x27;s books, including &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;, and &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;.

==Films==
Many Christmas stories have been adapted to movies and TV specials, and have been broadcast and repeated many times on TV. Since the popularization of home video in the 1980s, their many editions are sold and re-sold every year during the holiday shopping season. Notable examples are the many versions of the ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, the 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, and the similarly themed versions of Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, in which the elderly miser Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by ghosts and learns the errors of his ways. By contrast, the hero of the former, George Bailey, is a businessman who sacrificed his dreams to help his community. On Christmas Eve, a guardian angel finds him in despair and prevents him from committing suicide, by supernaturally showing him how much he meant to the world around him.

A few films based on fictionalized versions of true stories have become Christmas specials themselves. The story behind the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot; and the story of &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot; are two examples.

Films revolving around the Nativity story of Christmas are regularly produced such as &quot;The Nativity Story&quot; (2006), &quot;The Star&quot; (2017), and &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; (1965). Sometimes, family films and classics boasting special effects and/or uplifting messages, but having no real relation to Christmas, are telecast during the season as part of the holiday programming. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, for instance, was always telecast during the Christmas season between 1959 and 1962. Other films often seen around the Christmas period are &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot;, &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, Johnny Depp&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; &quot;Saga&quot;, &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot;, &quot;The Star Wars&quot; &quot;Saga&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Maleficent&quot;, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;, Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider&quot; &quot;Man&quot; &quot;trilogy&quot;, &quot;Paddington&quot;, &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, Robert Downey Jr&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes Saga&quot;, &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Enchanted&quot;, &quot;the Mamma Mia! saga&quot;, &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;, &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Bedknobs &amp; Broomsticks&quot;, the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; movies, &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, the &quot;Marvel Cinematic Universe&quot; movies, the &quot;DC Extended Universe&quot; movies and Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Middle Earth&quot; &quot;saga&quot;, as well as several animated Disney, DreamWorks, Aardman, Studio Ghibli, Illumination, Laika and Pixar movies. Others have some scenes during the Christmas season, such as the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films which are frequently included in the viewing rotation. The action film &quot;Die Hard&quot; is seen by some as a Christmas film, as it takes place on the holiday, and is often viewed during the season, although whether or not &quot;Die Hard&quot; should be considered a Christmas film has been debated due to its story not being about the holiday itself. Others in this category include &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, &quot;Shazam!&quot; and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, during the 2000s ITV usually showed a James Bond and/or a &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film(s) during the Christmas Holidays whilst the BBC showed the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and/or &quot;High School Musical&quot; films. And for many years Channel 5 have shown American/Canadian made-for-TV Christmas films during the weeks before Christmas.

In North America, the holiday movie season often includes release of studios&#x27; most prestigious pictures, in an effort both to capture holiday crowds and to position themselves for Oscar consideration. Next to summer, this is the second-most lucrative season for the industry. In fact, a few films each year open on the actual Christmas Day holiday. Christmas movies generally open no later than Thanksgiving, as their themes are not so popular once the season is over. Likewise, the home video release of these films is typically delayed until the beginning of the next year&#x27;s Christmas season.

American Christmas-themed films are also broadcast on the Hallmark Channel and its companion channel Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries, which during the holiday season generally feature new films along with reruns of favorites from prior years. Actresses Candace Cameron Bure, Lacey Chabert, and Danica McKellar, along with actor Niall Matter, are frequently featured in lead or major roles. The films themselves generally feature a similar theme of a person who has &quot;lost the Christmas spirit&quot; and through &quot;Christmas magic&quot; regains it (commonly by a romantic encounter; frequently one of the two in the romance is a single parent or has lost someone special around a prior Christmas season). Another theme plays on the &quot;big city-small town&quot; dynamic, whereby a lead character has either left a small hometown for the big city (and has had to return), or a big city person has to go to a small town, in either case deciding that the small town is where they should remain. A main character will also have a Christmas-sounding name (such as &quot;Holly&quot;) and/or the small town will (such as &quot;Christmas Valley&quot;).

The settings are usually in the northern United States, or in a mountain area (such as Colorado), where snow (and the ensuing &quot;White Christmas&quot;) are used as a backdrop for the film (though the films themselves are often filmed in British Columbia due to favorable film tax benefits).

As of 2020 &quot;The Grinch&quot; is the highest grossing Christmas film of all time. &quot;Green Book&quot; was the last movie with a Christmas setting to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Television specials and episodes==
Before 1962, when &quot;Mr. Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; premiered, true Christmas specials made for TV were either adaptations of stories such as &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (with live actors), or the Nativity Story, or episodes of variety shows highlighting Christmas music. They were often hosted by such celebrities as Perry Como, Jane Wyatt, or Florence Henderson. (A notable exception was &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; in 1950, which, although featuring an appearance by Alexander Scourby, who also narrated, starred the Mabel Beaton Marionettes.)

This all changed once variety shows began dying out in the late 1980s and Rankin-Bass began producing more and more Christmas specials.

One notable television special usually seen at Christmas was &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;, commissioned by NBC and telecast annually in the U.S. from 1951 to 1966. It was the first opera written especially for television. Composed by Gian-Carlo Menotti with a libretto in English by the composer, the opera told of a disabled beggar boy living with his (presumably) widowed mother in the Holy Land. They are visited by the Three Wise Men who are on their way to see the Christ Child, and when Amahl offers his crutch as a gift, he is miraculously cured. In 1978, it returned to television, with less success.

===United Kingdom===
TV programmes which have had special Christmas episodes in the United Kingdom include &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (from 1960s-2006), &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot; (1970s), &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; (1980s), &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; (both 1990s), and more recently, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Top Gear&quot; (both 2000s), &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2010s), &quot;The Repair Shop&quot; and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; (both 2020s).

The 1982 animated tale &quot;The Snowman&quot; has been screened for many years during the Christmas period (usually Christmas Eve or Christmas Day), and the 1991 short animated film, &quot;Father Christmas&quot;, by the same artist and company, is usually broadcast around the same time.

Adaptations of novels from Charles Dickens are also common around Christmas time. Along with &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (the most popular due to its Christmas season setting, and the message portrayed), these also include &quot;Bleak House&quot; (2005), &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (2007) and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (2011), among others. These adaptations usually feature all-star casts.

Christmas Day begins at 12 at night with the showing of Midnight Mass on the BBC. In addition, the monarch annually broadcasts a 10-minute speech on Christmas Day at 3 p.m. Many long-running British soap operas have Christmas specials, usually involving a dramatic storyline developed over several weeks which culminates at Christmas. Often these stories are tragic, involving a death, divorce, a dramatic revelation or similar event.

Most Christmas specials in the UK are specially commissioned separately to a production season, and many are extended from the usual episode length. For example, the 2007 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special was 71 minutes as opposed to the standard 45 minutes, was broadcast six months after the third series had finished and four months before the fourth series started. UK Christmas specials may or may not feature the holiday itself as part of the narrative.

While the season receives almost universal acknowledgement on British TV, some channels and programmes have tried &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;anti-Christmas&quot; ideas. One example is Channel 4 which has run an Alternative Christmas message since 1993. In 2009, two movie channels renamed themselves for the season; Sky Movies Screen 2 became &quot;Sky Movies Christmas Channel&quot; and Movies 24 became &quot;Christmas 24&quot;. From 2010, changes to Sky Movies line-up meant that Sky Movies Showcase was used for Sky Movies Christmas Channel. On 16 November 2012, two music channels renamed themselves; Bliss became &quot;Blissmas&quot; and Greatest Hits TV was rebranded as &quot;Christmas Hits TV&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States, many television series (particularly those of a family-oriented nature) produce a Christmas episode, although seldom outside of a season&#x27;s production block. Stand-alone Christmas specials are also popular, from newly created animated shorts and movies to repeats of those that were popular in previous years, such as &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; and &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;. Some local affiliates provide the &quot;Yule Log,&quot; a block of time either on Christmas morning or both during the evening hours of Christmas Eve and Christmas morning showing footage of a fireplace, coupled with popular Christmas music. Some local affiliates that provide the &quot;Yule Log&quot; simulcast Christmas music from a radio station playing it.

Every Christmas Day, ABC (since 1996) airs a Christmas parade at Walt Disney World Resort and along with its sister cable network, ESPN (since they jointly acquired broadcast rights to the league in 2002), NBA games featuring some of the league&#x27;s best teams and players, broadcasting a doubleheader (or as many as five games between the two networks in certain years); the NBA&#x27;s Christmas Day games are notable as they historically serve as the league&#x27;s first game telecasts on over-the-air network television each season. NBC airs the Vatican Midnight Mass service at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on Christmas Eve night (having broadcast the service annually since 1972, typically in place of the network&#x27;s regular late-night programming), and usually airs an ice skating special (often on the weekend prior to or of the holiday). Additionally, CBS usually airs college basketball games the day after Christmas while NBC airs a Premier League soccer match that same day.

Christmas specials based on classical music have also been well received. Among them, in addition to the previously mentioned &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;, have been the many telecasts of the ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, and concert specials featuring musicians such as the Boston Pops, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Cincinnati Pops, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.

==Radio==
Many radio stations begin to add Christmas music to their rotation in late November, and often switch to all-Christmas programming for December 25. Some do for part of or all of December 24 as well. A few stations switch to all-Christmas music for the entire season (some beginning as early as mid-November); in Detroit, 100.3 WNIC in 2005 started Christmas music day and night on midnight of October 31 because programmers believed that at least some listeners who are attracted by the Christmas music will remain loyal listeners when the station reverts to its standard format on Boxing Day. Radio stations also broadcast traditional Western art music, such as the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. Among other pieces inspired by Christmas are Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; and the popular suite drawn from it, and Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; (BWV 248). Some radio stations play Christmas music commercial-free the entire day on Christmas Day, with only interruptions for Christmas messages from station personnel and personnel from the station&#x27;s parent company. Others, like 96.5 KOIT in San Francisco do on both part of or all of Christmas Eve and the entire day Christmas Day. Frequently, the first song played on an &quot;all-Christmas&quot; station is the popular tune &quot;It&#x27;s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas&quot;.

The Music Choice channels have over the past few years have begun playing Christmas music as early as the beginning of November, instead of waiting till after Thanksgiving.

The UK music industry features the battle of the bands and artists to make it to the Christmas No. 1 spot, recognised on the first Sunday before, or on, Christmas Day. Many of these songs are festive, while others are novelty songs that remain but briefly at the top of the chart. Gospel singer Cliff Richard is a fixture of Christmas charts, appearing nearly every year, and subsequently being mocked for doing so. In more recent years the Christmas chart has been dominated by the winner of &quot;The X Factor&quot; and various social media backed records aimed to hijack the charts.

As with television, British radio programmes also schedule Christmas specials. These mainly include comedy shows such as &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; and &quot;The Now Show&quot;.

<text>The University of Art and Design Linz is one of four universities in Linz, Upper Austria.

No consensus has yet been reached on the university&#x27;s name in English. The Legal Information System of the Republic of Austria calls it the &quot;University of Art and Design Linz&quot; in an English translation of the current version of the Austrian Universities Act 2002. The Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research calls it the &quot;University of Art and Industrial Design in Linz&quot;, and the university calls itself the &quot;University of Arts Linz&quot;.

The University of Art and Design Linz has its institutional and programmatic roots in the “Kunstschule” (Art School) of the City of Linz, which was founded in 1947, assigned academy status in 1973 and finally made a fully-fledged university in 1998. The institution was conceived as an explicit statement to signify dissociation from the previous art policy of the National Socialist era. This is in particular exemplified by its emphasis on the fundamental values of freedom of art and research, its commitment to modernism and contemporary art and the positioning of the University at the interface of free-artistic and applied-economically oriented design. In the past as in the present, these values form the basis of the fundamental essence and identity of the Kunstuniversität Linz.
Since 1 January 2004, the university is constituted as a “corporation under public law” according to the new Universities Organisation Act of 2002 and hence enjoys far-reaching autonomy.
In the context of the regional and international frame conditions within which Kunstuniversität Linz operates, three main orientations were evolved over the past few years. Going beyond specialist competencies per se, they are of particular importance for artistic development, research and teaching and moreover reflect the unique profile of the university.

== History ==

===1947===
The University of Art and Design Linz is the successor to the Art School (“Kunstschule”) of the City of Linz, established in 1947. Originally, the School is assigned premises in the western bridgehead building at Hauptplatz 8. In later years, branch facilities are set up in Bischofstraße and Prunerstraße. The institution operates two master schools of painting, headed by Herbert Dimmel and Karl Hauk, who also serves as director of the Art School until 1949, as well as one master school of graphic art, headed by Alfons Ortner.
In 1948 and 1951, respectively, a master school of sculpture, headed by Walter Ritter, and a master school of typography and applied graphic design, headed by Friedrich Neugebauer, follow suit.

===1959/60===
Alfons Ortner is appointed director. His goal is to bring the Art School closer to becoming an academy of applied art.

===1961/62===

In 1961, the Art School of the City of Linz is awarded full public-law status by the Federal Ministry of Education; the statute of the school and the curricular, scholastic and examination regulations are revised; the “master schools” are now called “master classes”. The following new master classes are introduced: 
Advertising Art, head: Erich Buchegger
Basic Course, head: Roxane Cuvay

===1973===
The Federal Act of 9 May 1973, Federal Gazette No. 251/1973, transforms the institution into the “Academy of Art and Industrial Design in Linz” (Hochschule für künstlerische und industrielle Gestaltung in Linz). Alfons Ortner is voted founding rector.

At this time, the institution offered the following master classes:
*Painting and Graphic Art, Alfons Ortner
*Advertising Art, Erich Buchegger
*Typography and Book Design, Friedrich Neugebauer
*Interior Design, Friedrich Goffitzer
*Industrial Design, Horst C. H. Meru
*Ceramics, Günter Praschak
*Three-dimensional Design – Metal, Helmuth Gsöllpointner
*Three-dimensional Design – Sculpture, Erwin Reiter
*Basic Course, Roxane Cuvay (interim)

and the following chairs:
*Environment Design, Günther Feuerstein
*Art Education, Hannes Haybäck

===1975 and 1976===
Endowment of a chair for handicraft education and appointment of Helmut Huber as its head and endowment of a chair for textile design and appointment of Fritz Riedl as its head.

===1977 to 1980===
In autumn 1977, the &quot;Fund of the Academy of Design of Linz” organises the exhibition “Forum Metall Linz” (concept developers, organisers and artistic directors: Helmuth Gsöllpointner and Peter Baum).
In summer 1980, the Fund co-operates with the New Gallery of the City of Linz and others in organising the exhibition “Forum Design – Design formt den Alltag” (concept by Helmuth Gsöllpointner, Angela Hareiter, Laurids Ortner and Peter Baum).

===1984 to 1990===
The construction of a new building for the institution is initiated and the former Ringbrot factory in Urfahr, Sonnensteinstraße/Reindlstraße is converted to university use.
The chair for handicraft education and the master classes for sculpture, visual design and ceramics move into the converted building in 1986. In 1990, the master classes for painting and graphic art, visual media design, metal, textile design, the chair for environment design, the central media workshop, the printing shop, the silkscreen workshop, the chapter of the Austrian National Union of Students and parts of the administration move into the new building in Urfahr.

===1995 to 1997===
The former pipe tobacco factory (Peter Behrens Building) on Untere Donaulände (built between 1929 and 1935 by Peter Behrens and Alexander Popp) is rented.
The master classes for sculpture and experimental visual design move from Urfahr to the Peter Behrens Building.

===1998 to 2000===
On 1 October 1998, the new Federal Universities of the Arts Organisation Act (KUOG) enters into force. As per this day, the institution becomes the &quot;University of Art and Design Linz&quot;. As per 27 September 2000, all bodies of Kunstuniversität Linz are elected according to the provisions of KUOG 1998, and as per 28 September 2000, the institution is wholly subject to KUOG 1998.

On 5 April 2000, Reinhard Kannonier is elected the first rector under the provisions of KUOG 1998.

===2002 to 2003===
Foundation of the Forum – Friends and Alumni of Kunstuniversität Linz; setting-up of the international research laboratory Design-Organisation-Media (DOM); (head: Michael Shamiyeh).

Reinhard Kannonier is re-elected rector for another four-year term of office. Acting upon a proposal by Kannonier, the University Council chooses three Vice-Rectors. The size of the Senate of Kunstuniversität Linz is set at 12 members by the founding assembly.

===2004===
Since 1 January 2004, the university has been operating as a “corporation under public law” according to the new Universities Organisation Act of 2002 and hence is largely autonomous.

What has remained a constant for the many decades since its inception are several core competencies of Kunstuniversität Linz: free artistic and applied design, interdisciplinarity, teaching at a very high level. 
In recent years, the profile of the university has been largely determined by the three focuses on intermediality, spatial strategies and artistic-scientific research.

<text>Anthonie (Antoon) Cornelis Oudemans Jzn (November 12, 1858 – January 14, 1943) was a Dutch zoologist. Although he was a specialist in acarology, the study of the ticks and mites, he was often best known for his books on sea monsters and the dodo.

Born in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, he was the son of the noted Dutch astronomer Jean Abraham Chrétien Oudemans and the grandson of the Dutch educator, poet and philologist Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans Sr., after whom he was named. He often used the patronymic &quot;Jzn&quot; (for &quot;Jeanzoon&quot;) in his publications. A cousin was the entomologist J.T. Oudemans. He was educated at Arnhem and went to the University of Utrecht. He wrote his dissertation on ribbon worms, and in 1885 was appointed director of the Royal Zoological Gardens at The Hague. Oudemans worked on the acari and comprehensively reviewed all literature until 1850 in a series of articles titled &quot;Kritisch historisch Overzicht der Acarologie&quot;. He described numerous species not only of acari and insects but even a primate species, the black crested mangabey.

1892 saw the publication of Oudeman&#x27;s &quot;The Great Sea Serpent&quot;, a study of the many sea serpent reports from the world&#x27;s oceans. Oudemans concluded that such creatures might be a previously unknown large seal, which he dubbed &quot;Megophias megophias&quot;. Reception of the volume has been described as respectful but &quot;cold&quot;. Bernard Heuvelmans later suggested that &quot;The Great Sea Serpent&quot; was the root of cryptozoology.

In 1917, he published &quot;Dodo-studiën: naar aanleiding van de vondst van een gevelsteen met dodo-beeld van 1561 te Vere&quot;, an article on extinct dodo research.

In 1895, Oudemans left The Hague to teach biology in the Frisian city of Sneek. He published several scientific articles in later years. He had married Helena Johanna van de Velde in 1887, but became a widower, and remarried to Aletta Amelia Louise Pilgrim in 1919.

In 1942, he donated the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie his important collection of mites (Acari). This collection numbers 5981 slides (1316 species). After his death, the accompanying drawings were bequeathed to the museum as well.

Oudemans died in Arnhem in 1943.

<doc id="1277011" wikidata="Q2028854" url="?curid=1277011" title="System Idle Process">
<text>In Windows NT operating systems, the System Idle Process contains one or more kernel threads which run when no other runnable thread can be scheduled on a CPU. In a multiprocessor system, there is one idle thread associated with each CPU core. For a system with hyperthreading enabled, there is an idle thread for each logical processor. 

The primary purpose of the idle process and its threads is to eliminate what would otherwise be a special case in the scheduler. Without the idle threads, there could be cases when no threads were runnable (or &quot;Ready&quot; in terms of Windows scheduling states). Since the idle threads are always in a Ready state (if not already Running), this can never happen. Thus whenever the scheduler is called due to the current thread leaving its CPU, another thread can always be found to run on that CPU, even if it is only the CPU&#x27;s idle thread. The CPU time attributed to the idle process is therefore indicative of the amount of CPU time that is &quot;not&quot; needed or wanted by any other threads in the system. 

The scheduler treats the idle threads as special cases in terms of thread scheduling priority. The idle threads are scheduled as if they each had a priority lower than can be set for any ordinary thread. 

Because of the idle process&#x27;s function, its CPU time measurement (visible through, for example, Windows Task Manager) may make it appear to users that the idle process is monopolizing the CPU. However, the idle process does not use up computer resources (even when stated to be running at a high percent). Its CPU time &quot;usage&quot; is a measure of how much CPU time is not being used by other threads. 

In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.

There are more detailed sources of such information available through Windows&#x27; performance monitoring system (accessible with the perfmon program), which includes more finely grained categorization of CPU usage. A limited subset of the CPU time categorization is also accessible through the Task Manager, which can display CPU usage by CPU, and categorized by time spent in user vs. kernel code.

<doc id="1277014" wikidata="Q922790" url="?curid=1277014" title="Battle of Hubbardton">
<text>The Battle of Hubbardton was an engagement in the Saratoga campaign of the American Revolutionary War fought in the village of Hubbardton, Vermont. Vermont was then a disputed territory sometimes called the New Hampshire Grants, claimed by New York, New Hampshire, and the newly organized, not yet recognized, but de facto independent government of Vermont. On the morning of July 7, 1777, British forces, under General Simon Fraser, caught up with the American rear guard of the forces retreating after the withdrawal from Fort Ticonderoga. It was the only battle in Vermont during the revolution. (The Battle of Bennington was fought in what is now Walloomsac, New York.)

The American retreat from Fort Ticonderoga began late on July 5 after British cannons were seen on top of high ground, Mount Defiance ( Rattlesnake Mountain and Sugar Loaf Hill) that commanded the fort. The bulk of General Arthur St. Clair&#x27;s army retreated through Hubbardton to Castleton, while the rear guard, commanded by Seth Warner, stopped at Hubbardton to rest and pick up stragglers.

General Fraser, alerted to the American withdrawal early on July 6, immediately set out in pursuit, leaving a message for General John Burgoyne to send reinforcements as quickly as possible. That night Fraser camped a few miles short of Hubbardton, and the German General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, leading reinforcements, camped a few miles further back. Rising early in the morning, Fraser reached Hubbardton, where he surprised some elements of the American rear, while other elements managed to form defensive lines. In a spirited battle, the Americans were driven back, but had almost succeeded in turning Fraser&#x27;s left flank when Riedesel and his German reinforcements arrived, eventually scattering the American forces.

The battle took a large enough toll on the British forces that they did not further pursue the main American army. The many American prisoners were sent to Ticonderoga while most of the British troops made their way to Skenesboro to rejoin Burgoyne&#x27;s army. Most of the scattered American remnants made their way to rejoin St. Clair&#x27;s army on its way toward the Hudson River.

==Background==

General John Burgoyne began his 1777 campaign for control of the Hudson River valley by moving an army of 8,000 down Lake Champlain in late June, arriving near Fort Ticonderoga on July 1. On July 5, General Arthur St. Clair&#x27;s American forces defending Fort Ticonderoga and its supporting defenses discovered that Burgoyne&#x27;s men had placed cannons on a position overlooking the fort. They evacuated the fort that night, with the majority of the army marching down a rough road (now referred to locally as the 1776 Hubbardton Military Road) toward Hubbardton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory. The day was hot and sunny, and the pace was rapid and grueling; most of the army marched to Castleton before making camp on the evening of July 6.

==British troops give chase==

The British general, a Scotsman named Simon Fraser discovered early on July 6 that the Americans had abandoned Ticonderoga. Leaving a message for General Burgoyne, he set out in pursuit with companies of grenadiers (9th, 29th, 34th, and 62nd Foot) and light infantry (24th, 29th, 34th, 53rd, and 62nd), as well as two companies of the 24th Regiment and about 100 Loyalists and Indian scouts. Burgoyne ordered Riedesel to follow; he set out with a few companies of Brunswick jägers and grenadiers, leaving orders for the rest of his troops to come as rapidly as possible. Fraser&#x27;s advance corps was only a few miles behind Colonel Ebenezer Francis&#x27; 11th Massachusetts Regiment, which acted as St. Clair&#x27;s rear guard.

American general St. Clair paused at Hubbardton to give the main army&#x27;s tired and hungry troops time to rest while he hoped the rear guard would arrive. When it did not arrive in time, he left Colonel Seth Warner and the Green Mountain Boys behind, along with the 2nd New Hampshire Regiment under Colonel Nathan Hale, to wait for the rear guard while the main army marched on to Castleton. When Francis&#x27; and Hale&#x27;s men arrived, Warner decided, against St. Clair&#x27;s orders, that they would spend the night there, rather than marching on to Castleton. Warner, who had experience in rear-guard actions while serving in the invasion of Quebec, arranged the camps in a defensive position on Monument Hill, and set patrols to guard the road to Ticonderoga.

Baron Riedesel caught up with Fraser around 4 pm, and insisted that his men could not go further before making camp. Fraser, who acquiesced to this as Riedesel was senior to him in the chain of command, pointed out that he was authorized to engage the enemy, and would be leaving his camp at 3 am the next morning. He then advanced until he found a site about three miles (4.8 km) from Hubbardton, where his troops camped for the night. Riedesel waited for the bulk of his men, about 1,500 strong, and also made camp.

==Attack==
Fraser&#x27;s men were up at 3 am, but did not make good time due to the darkness. Riedesel left his camp at 3 am with a picked group of men, and was still behind Fraser when the latter arrived at Hubbardton near dawn and very nearly surprised elements of Hale&#x27;s regiment, which were scattered in the early fighting. A messenger had arrived from General St. Clair delivering news that the British had reached Skenesboro, where the elements of the retreating army had planned to regroup, and that a more circuitous route to the Hudson River was now required. St. Clair&#x27;s instructions were to follow him immediately to Rutland. Francis&#x27; men had formed a column to march out around 7:15 when the British vanguard began cresting the hill behind them. Rapidly reforming into a line behind some cover, the Massachusetts men unleashed a withering volley of fire at the winded British. General Fraser took stock of the situation, and decided to send a detachment around to flank the American left, at the risk of exposing his own left, which he hoped would hold until Riedesel arrived. Riedesel reached the top of another hill, where he observed that the American line, now including parts of Hale&#x27;s regiment, was in fact pressing on Fraser&#x27;s left. He therefore sent his grenadiers to support Fraser&#x27;s flank and directed the jägers against the American center.
At some point early in the conflict, St. Clair was made aware of the gunfire off in the distance. He immediately dispatched Henry Brockholst Livingston and Isaac Dunn to send the militia camped closest to Hubbardton down the road in support of the action. When they reached the area of those camps they found those militia companies in full retreat away from the gunfire in the distance, and no amount of persuasion could convince the men to turn around. Livingston and Dunn continued riding toward Hubbardton.

Falling back to a secure position on Monument Hill, the Americans repulsed several vigorous British assaults, although Colonel Francis was hit in the arm by a shot. He soldiered on, directing troops to a perceived weakness on Fraser&#x27;s left. The tide of the battle turned when, after more than an hour of battle, Riedesel&#x27;s grenadiers arrived. These disciplined forces entered the fray singing hymns to the accompaniment of a military band to make them appear more numerous than they actually were. The American flanks were turned, and they were forced to make a desperate race across an open field to avoid being enveloped. Colonel Francis fell in a volley of musket fire as the troops raced away from the advancing British and scattered into the countryside.

==Aftermath==
The remnants of the American rear guard made their way toward Rutland to rejoin the main army. Harassed by Fraser&#x27;s scouts and Indians, and without food or shelter, it took some of them five days to reach the army. Livingston and Dunn were met by retreating Americans on the Castleton road. They returned to Castleton with the news about the Hubbardton battle, and St. Clair then marched the army towards the American camp at Fort Edward, which it reached on July 12. Others Americans from the rear guard, including Colonel Hale and a 230-man detachment, were captured. As a sign of respect, the British buried Colonel Francis with their Brunswick dead.

Baron Riedesel and the Brunswickers departed for Skenesboro the next day. Their departure left Fraser in &quot;the most disaffected part of America, every person a Spy&quot;, with 600 tired men, a sizable contingent of prisoners and wounded, and no significant supplies. On July 9 he sent the 300 prisoners, under light guard but with threats of retaliation should they try to escape, toward Ticonderoga while he marched his exhausted forces toward Castleton and then Skenesboro.

Though many Americans were taken prisoner and marched back to Fort Ticonderoga, the main body of Saint Clair&#x27;s troops escaped, which led to American successes at the Battle of Bennington and Battles of Saratoga. The Battle of Hubbardton was a British tactical victory, because the British defeated the American rear guard. It was a strategic American victory, because the main body of troops that evacuated Ticonderoga was able to continue the fight against Burgoyne&#x27;s invasion force.

==Losses==
The official casualty return for the British troops gives 39 British soldiers and 1 French-Canadian killed and 127 British and 2 French-Canadians wounded. A separate return for the German troops has 10 killed and 14 wounded, for a grand total of 50 killed and 143 wounded. Historian Richard M. Ketchum gives different British casualties of 60 killed and 168 wounded. 
Ketchum gives American casualties as 41 killed, 96 wounded and 230 captured. However, Lt. Anburey, present at the battle, states that the total dead and wounded of both sides found on the field in the aftermath amounted to 200 and 600 respectively. Subtracting the British-Canadian-German casualty returns from that gives American losses of 150 killed, 457 wounded and 230 captured.

==Hubbardton Battlefield Historic Site==

A local body commissioned the erection of a monument on the battlefield site in 1859, and the state began acquiring battlefield lands in the 1930s for operation as a state historic site. Hubbardton Battlefield has been owned and operated by the State of Vermont&#x27;s Division for Historic Preservation since 1937. The battlefield was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and is the site of annual Revolutionary War reenactments. The site&#x27;s visitor center features a permanent exhibit which tells the story of the Battle of Hubbardton and places it in its context of the Revolutionary War. The Hubbardton Battlefield Trail features interpretive signs highlighting important points and locations of the battle.

==In popular culture==
The battle is used as the backdrop for the climax of the film &quot;Time Chasers&quot;. The battlefield is approximately 20 miles northwest of Rutland, Vermont, where most of the film&#x27;s production was centered.

<doc id="1277015" wikidata="Q7605962" url="?curid=1277015" title="Steering law">
<text>The steering law in human–computer interaction and ergonomics is a predictive model of human movement that describes the time required to navigate, or &quot;steer&quot;, through a 2-dimensional tunnel. The tunnel can be thought of as a path or trajectory on a plane that has an associated thickness or width, where the width can vary along the tunnel. The goal of a steering task is to navigate from one end of the tunnel to the other as quickly as possible, without touching the boundaries of the tunnel. A real-world example that approximates this task is driving a car down a road that may have twists and turns, where the car must navigate the road as quickly as possible without touching the sides of the road. The steering law predicts both the instantaneous speed at which we may navigate the tunnel, and the total time required to navigate the entire tunnel.

The steering law has been independently discovered and studied three times (Rashevsky, 1959; Drury, 1971; Accot and Zhai, 1997). Its most recent discovery has been within the human–computer interaction community, which has resulted in the most general mathematical formulation of the law.

==The steering law in human–computer interaction==

Within human–computer interaction, the law was rediscovered by Johnny Accot and Shumin Zhai, who mathematically derived it in a novel way from Fitts&#x27;s law using integral calculus, experimentally verified it for a class of tasks, and developed the most general mathematical statement of it. Some researchers within this community have sometimes referred to the law as the Accot–Zhai steering law or Accot&#x27;s law (Accot is pronounced &quot;ah-cot&quot; in English and &quot;ah-koh&quot; in French). In this context, the steering law is a predictive model of human movement, concerning the speed and total time with which a user may steer a pointing device (such as a mouse or stylus) through a 2D tunnel presented on a screen (i.e. with a bird&#x27;s eye view of the tunnel), where the user must travel from one end of the path to the other as quickly as possible, while staying within the confines of the path. One potential practical application of this law is in modelling a user&#x27;s performance in navigating a hierarchical cascading menu.

Many researchers in human–computer interaction, including Accot himself, find it surprising or even amazing that the steering law model predicts performance as well as it does, given the almost purely mathematical way in which it was derived. Some consider this a testament to the robustness of Fitts&#x27;s law.

In its general form, the steering law can be expressed as

:formula_1

where &quot;T&quot; is the average time to navigate through the path, &quot;C&quot; is the path parameterized by &quot;s&quot;, &quot;W(s)&quot; is the width of the path at &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are experimentally fitted constants. In general, the path may have a complicated curvilinear shape (such as a spiral) with variable thickness &quot;W(s)&quot;.

Simpler paths allow for mathematical simplifications of the general form of the law. For example, if the path is a straight tunnel of constant width &quot;W&quot;, the equation reduces to

:formula_2

where &quot;A&quot; is the length of the path. We see, especially in this simplified form, a &quot;speed–accuracy&quot; tradeoff, somewhat similar to that in Fitts&#x27;s law.

We can also differentiate both sides of the integral equation with respect to &quot;s&quot; to obtain the local, or instantaneous, form of the law:

:formula_3

which says that the instantaneous speed of the user is proportional to the width of the tunnel. This makes intuitive sense if we consider the analogous task of driving a car down a road: the wider the road, the faster we can drive and still stay on the road, even if there are curves in the road.

==Derivation of the model from Fitts&#x27;s law==

This derivation is only meant as a high level sketch. It lacks the illustrations of, and may differ in detail from, the derivation given by Accot and Zhai (1997).

Assume that the time required for goal passing (i.e. passing a pointer through a goal at distance &quot;A&quot; and of width &quot;W&quot;,
oriented perpendicular to the axis of motion) can be modeled with this form of Fitts&#x27;s law:

:formula_4

Then, a straight tunnel of length &quot;A&quot; and constant width &quot;W&quot; can be approximated as a sequence of &quot;N&quot; evenly spaced goals, each separated from its neighbours by a distance of &quot;A/N&quot;. We can let &quot;N&quot; grow arbitrarily large, making the distance between successive goals become infinitesimal. The total time to navigative through all the goals, and thus through the tunnel, is

Note that &quot;b&quot; is an experimentally fitted constant and let formula_5. Therefore, &quot;T&quot;straight tunnel = formula_6.

Next, consider a curved tunnel of total length &quot;A&quot;, parameterized by &quot;s&quot; varying from 0 to &quot;A&quot;. Let &quot;W(s)&quot; be the variable width of the tunnel. The tunnel can be approximated as a sequence of &quot;N&quot; straight tunnels, numbered 1 through &quot;N&quot;, each located at &quot;si&quot; where &quot;i&quot; = 1 to &quot;N&quot;, and each of length &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 − &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; and of width &quot;W&quot;(&quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;). We can let &quot;N&quot; grow arbitrarily large, making the length of successive straight tunnels become infinitesimal. The total time to navigative through the curved tunnel is

yielding the general form of the steering law.

==Modeling steering in layers ==
Steering law has been extended to predict movement time for steering in layers of thickness &quot;t&quot; (Kattinakere et al., 2007). The relation is given by

: formula_7

<text>Achnashellach railway station is a railway station serving Achnashellach on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line, in Wester Ross, Scotland. The station lies between Strathcarron and Achnasheen, from . ScotRail, who manage the station, operate all services.

== History ==

The station was privately opened by the Dingwall and Skye Railway in August 1870, primarily to serve Achnashellach Lodge near Loch Dughaill, but was operated from the outset by the Highland Railway (HR), and only opened to the public a year later, on 1 May 1871. The passing loop at the station was removed in 1966, and the wooden station buildings removed a few years after, although he remains of the second platform are partially visible.

=== Accidents and incidents ===
On 14 October 1892, Achnashellach was the scene of a runaway train in which the brake in the brake van had malfunctioned. Subsequently, this train moved off down the slope at considerable speed without a locomotive to keep it under control. Reaching the bottom of the slope, it had enough energy to proceed back uphill, before running down the slope once again. Unfortunately, another train was approaching Achnashellach in the opposite direction at that very moment, and the two trains collided at the bottom of the slope with great force. Eight passengers were injured, though none seriously, and the track was not damaged with only minor damage occurring to the rolling stock.
== Facilities ==
Facilities, like at many other stations on the line, are incredibly basic, comprising just a shelter, help point and bike racks, although the station is fully accessible. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.

== Passenger volume ==
The main origin or destination station for journeys to or from Achnashellach in the 2022–23 period was Inverness, making up 410 of the 752 journeys (54.5%).

== Services ==

Four trains each way call (on request) on weekdays and Saturdays and one each way all year on Sundays, plus a second from May to late September only.

<text>The Louvre Accord (formally, the Statement of the G6 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors) was an agreement, signed on February 22, 1987, in Paris, that aimed to stabilize international currency markets and halt the continued decline of the US dollar after 1985 following the Plaza Accord. It was considered, from a relational international contract viewpoint, as a rational compromise solution between two ideal-type extremes of international monetary regimes: the perfectly flexible and the perfectly fixed exchange rates.

The agreement was signed by Canada, France, West Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Italian government was invited to sign the agreement but declined.

== Background == 
The Plaza Accord is recognized as the precursor to the Louvre Accord and this deal was struck to depreciate the US dollar for the purpose of exchange rate realignment with the Japanese yen and German Deutsche Mark, which was agreed upon during the G7 Minister of Finance meeting held in New York in 1985. The United States had a trade deficit while Japan and a few European countries were experiencing a trade surplus along with negative GDP growth. The then U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker attempted to address the imbalance by encouraging its trade partners to stimulate their economies so they can purchase more from it. He maintained that if these partners did not grow, he would allow the dollar&#x27;s continued depreciation.

After the Plaza Accord, the dollar depreciated, reaching an exchange rate of ¥150 per US$1 in 1987. By this time, the nominal dollar exchange rate against other currencies had fallen more than 25%. The ministers of the G7 nations gathered at the French finance ministry, then located inside the Louvre Palace in Paris, to minimize this decline and stabilize it around the prevailing levels. The Louvre Accord may have helped prevent a recession because it stopped the US dollar from decreasing further in relation to other currencies.

== Provisions ==
France agreed to reduce its budget deficits by 1% of GDP and cut taxes by the same amount for corporations and individuals. Japan would reduce its trade surplus and cut interest rates. The United Kingdom would reduce public expenditures and reduce taxes. Germany, the real object of this agreement because of its leading economic position in Europe, would reduce public spending, cut taxes for individuals and corporations, and keep interest rates low. The United States would reduce its fiscal 1988 deficit to 2.3% of GDP from an estimated 3.9% in 1987, reduce government spending by 1% in 1988 and keep interest rates low.

== Impact ==

The US dollar continued to weaken in 1987 against the Deutsche Mark and other major currencies, reaching a low of 1.57 marks per dollar and 121 yen per dollar in early 1988. The dollar then strengthened over the next 18 months, reaching over 2.04 marks per dollar and 160 yen per dollar, in tandem with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates aggressively, from 6.50% to 9.75%.

<text>James McCracken (December 16, 1926 – April 29, 1988) was an American operatic tenor. At the time of his death &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that McCracken was &quot;the most successful dramatic tenor yet produced by the United States and a pillar of the Metropolitan Opera during the 1960s and 1970s.&quot;

==Biography==
Born in Gary, Indiana, McCracken&#x27;s earliest musical experiences were singing in his church choir in childhood. In the US Navy during World War II, he sang in the Blue Jacket Choir. He studied music at Columbia University, with Elsa Seyfert in Konstanz, Germany, and then with Joyce McLean in New York City until his death.

McCracken made his professional opera debut in 1952 with the Central City Opera in Colorado as Rodolfo in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;. He sang minor roles at the Metropolitan Opera from 1953 to 1957, while still a student. In 1957, he moved to Europe and made his debut at the Vienna State Opera. He had great success with the Zürich Opera.

The role of Otello in Verdi&#x27;s opera, &quot;Otello&quot;, was one of his signature roles. Starting in 1963, he became one of the Met&#x27;s principal dramatic tenors. He replaced an injured Mario del Monaco at The Royal Opera House in London on very short notice on 11 April 1964, which won critical acclaim, including by Philip Hope-Wallace of &quot;The Guardian&quot; who described it as: &quot;[T]he audience know at once that this was the voice for the part: large, inclined to perhaps splay a little, but sonorous, the emanation of the true Otello...&quot;
James McCracken also starred in &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1972; in &quot;Aida&quot; directed by John Dexter in 1976; in &quot;Le prophete&quot; in 1977; and in &quot;Tannhauser&quot; in 1978, his only leading Wagnerian role.

Feeling slighted about being passed over for the September 1978 telecast of &quot;Otello&quot; which starred Jon Vickers, McCracken resigned from the Metropolitan Opera, only to return to a rousing ovation in October 1983 for the Centennial Gala, during which he performed Otello&#x27;s Act 3 soliloquy, &quot;Dio! mi potevi scagliar&quot;. The following season, he took part in a live telecast of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; on January 5, 1985, which was historic in that it was Leontyne Price&#x27;s farewell to the operatic stage.

McCracken&#x27;s voice was huge, with a distinctive and somewhat thick texture. Occasionally he was criticized for his less-than-effortless singing technique. But virtually all critics acknowledged his acting skill, as well as the overwhelming power of his sound and his clarion high notes.

He was married to mezzo-soprano Sandra Warfield, with whom he performed Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; at the Met. He was a member of the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s final U.S. tour, where he sang the role of Canio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;.

==Recordings==
McCracken made a number of complete opera recordings, including &quot;Le prophète&quot; (with Marilyn Horne and Renata Scotto, (Col/CBS), 1976), &quot;Carmen&quot; (conducted by Leonard Bernstein, (DG), 1972), &quot;Fidelio&quot; (with Birgit Nilsson, (Decca/London), 1964), &quot;Otello&quot; (with Dame Gwyneth Jones, (EMI/Angel), 1968) and &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, on which side 4 of the original LP version was a recital of opera arias, (Decca/London), (1967), as well as Schoenberg&#x27;s Gurre-Lieder (with Jessye Norman, Tatiana Troyanos and David Arnold, (Phi), 1979), and a program of Irish and Scottish songs with piano (EMI/Angel), 1977. Additionally, he sang the part of Waldemar in Gurre-Lieder when it opened the Edinburgh International Festival in 1961. The broadcast of this concert, under the direction of Leopold Stokowski, has now been issued on CD (Guild Historical).

<doc id="1277048" wikidata="Q3155362" url="?curid=1277048" title="Islam in Pakistan">
<text>Islam is the largest and the state religion of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Pakistan has over 240 Million adherents of Islam (including the administrative territory of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan) making it the second-largest Muslim population. As much as 90% of the population follows Sunni Islam and around 97% of Pakistanis follow Islam. Most Pakistani Sunni Muslims belong to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, which is represented by the Barelvi and Deobandi traditions.

Nearly 97% of Pakistanis are Muslims. The majority are Sunni(90%) while Shias make up around 10%. The Hanbali school has gained popularity recently due to Ahl-i Hadith and also Wahabbi influence from the Middle East. Smaller minority Muslim populations in Pakistan include Quranists, nondenominational Muslims. There are also two Mahdi&#x27;ist based creeds practised in Pakistan, namely Mahdavia and Ahmadiyya, the latter of whom are considered by the constitution of Pakistan to be non-Muslims; they jointly constitute less than 1% of the population. Pakistan has the world&#x27;s largest Muslim majority city (Karachi).

==History==
===Before independence ===
Islam had reached the Indian subcontinent during the lifetime of Muhammad. According to a tradition, Baba Ratan Hindi was a trader from Punjab who was one of the non-Arab companions of Muhammad. In 644 AD, the Rashidun caliphate conquered Makran after defeating the kingdom of Sindh in the battle of Rasil. According to Derryl N. Maclean, a link between Sindh and early partisans of Ali or proto-Shi&#x27;ites can be traced to Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi who traveled across Sind to Makran in the year 649 AD and presented a report on the area to the Caliph. During the Caliphate of Ali, many Hindus of Sindh had come under influence of Islam and some even participated in the Battle of Camel. In 712 CE, a young Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered most of the Indus region for the Caliphal empire, to be made the &quot;As-Sindh&quot; province with its capital at Al-Mansurah. The Pakistan government&#x27;s official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid. By the end of the 10th century CE, the region was ruled by several Hindu Shahi kings who would be subdued by the Ghaznavids.

The early medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region. During this period, Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to Islam. These developments set the stage for the rule of several successive Muslim empires in the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE). The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE).
===In independent Pakistan===
====Nature of state====
The Muslim League leadership, ulama (Islamic clergy) and Jinnah had articulated their vision of Pakistan in terms of an Islamic state. Muhammad Ali Jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama. When Jinnah died, Islamic scholar Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani described Jinnah as the greatest Muslim after the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and also compared Jinnah&#x27;s death to the Muhammad&#x27;s passing. Usmani asked Pakistanis to remember Jinnah&#x27;s message of Unity, Faith and Discipline and work to fulfil his dream:to create a solid bloc of all Muslim states from Karachi to Ankara, from Pakistan to Morocco. He [Jinnah] wanted to see the Muslims of the world united under the banner of Islam as an effective check against the aggressive designs of their enemies.The first formal step taken to transform Pakistan into an ideological Islamic state was in March 1949 when the country&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, introduced the Objectives Resolution in the Constituent Assembly. The Objectives Resolution declared that sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God. The president of the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, announced that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islamistan-a pan-Islamic entity. Khaliq believed that Pakistan was only a Muslim state and was not yet an Islamic state, but that it could certainly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of Islam into a single political unit. Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistani politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world:Pakistan was founded to advance the cause of Muslims. Other Muslims might have been expected to be sympathetic, even enthusiastic. But this assumed that other Muslim states would take the same view of the relation between religion and nationality.However, Pakistan&#x27;s pan-Islamist sentiments were not shared by other Muslim governments at the time. Nationalism in other parts of the Muslim world was based on ethnicity, language and culture. Although Muslim governments were unsympathetic with Pakistan&#x27;s pan-Islamic aspirations, Islamists from all over the world were drawn to Pakistan. Figures such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of Islamist political movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, became frequent visitors to the country. After General Zia-ul-Haq took power in a military coup, Hizb ut-Tahrir (an Islamist group calling for the establishment of a Caliphate) expanded its organisational network and activities in Pakistan. Its founder, Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani, would maintain regular correspondence with Abul A’la Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), and he also urged Dr. Israr Ahmed to continue his work in Pakistan for the establishment of a global caliphate.

Social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed conducted a survey in 1969 in pre-divided Pakistan on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people. He found that over 60% of people in East Pakistan (modern day Bangladesh) professed to have a secular national identity. However, in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) the same figure professed to have an Islamic and not a secular identity. Furthermore, the same figure in East Pakistan defined their identity in terms of their ethnicity and not Islam. It was the opposite in West Pakistan, where Islam was stated to be more important than ethnicity.

After Pakistan&#x27;s first ever general elections the 1973 Constitution was created by an elected Parliament. The Constitution declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic and Islam as the state religion. It also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted. The 1973 Constitution also created certain institutions such as the Shariat Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology to channel the interpretation and application of Islam.

====Zia ul Haq&#x27;s Islamization====

On 5 July 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq led a coup d&#x27;état. In the year or two before Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s coup, his predecessor, leftist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had faced vigorous opposition which was united under the revivalist banner of &quot;Nizam-e-Mustafa&quot; (&quot;Rule of the prophet&quot;). According to supporters of the movement, establishing an Islamic state based on &quot;sharia&quot; law would mean a return to the justice and success of the early days of Islam when Muhammad ruled the Muslims. In an effort to stem the tide of street Islamisation, Bhutto had also called for it and banned the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims, nightclubs and horse racing.
&quot;Islamisation&quot; was the &quot;primary&quot; policy,
or &quot;centerpiece&quot; of his government. Zia-ul-Haq committed himself to establishing an Islamic state and enforcing &quot;sharia&quot; law. Zia established separate Shariat judicial courts and court benches to judge legal cases using Islamic doctrine. New criminal offences (of adultery, fornication, and types of blasphemy), and new punishments (of whipping, amputation, and stoning to death), were added to Pakistani law. Interest payments for bank accounts were replaced by &quot;profit and loss&quot; payments. &quot;Zakat&quot; charitable donations became a 2.5% annual tax. School textbooks and libraries were overhauled to remove un-Islamic material. Offices, schools, and factories were required to offer praying space. Zia bolstered the influence of the &quot;ulama&quot; (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties, whilst conservative scholars became fixtures on television. 10,000s of activists from the Jamaat-e-Islami party were appointed to government posts to ensure the continuation of his agenda after his passing. Conservative &quot;ulama&quot; (Islamic scholars) were added to the Council of Islamic Ideology. Separate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985 even though Christian and Hindu leaders complained that they felt excluded from the county&#x27;s political process.

Zia&#x27;s state sponsored Islamization increased sectarian divisions in Pakistan between Sunnis and Shias and between Deobandis and Barelvis. A solid majority of Barelvis had supported the creation of Pakistan, and Barelvi ulama had also issued fatwas in support of the Pakistan Movement during the 1946 elections, but ironically Islamic state politics in Pakistan was mostly in favour of Deobandi (and later Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi) institutions. This was despite the fact that only a few (although influential) Deobandi clerics had supported the Pakistan Movement. Zia-ul-Haq forged a strong alliance between the military and Deobandi institutions. In Pakistan, actors who have been identified by the state as moderate Sufis—such as the Barelwis, a movement founded in the 19th century in response to conservative reformers such as the Deobandis—mobilized after the government&#x27;s call from 2009 onwards to save the soul of Pakistan from creeping “Talibanization.”

Possible motivations for the Islamization programme included Zia&#x27;s personal piety (most accounts agree that he came from a religious family), desire to gain political allies, to &quot;fulfill Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;&quot; as a Muslim state, and/or the political need to legitimise what was seen by some Pakistanis as his &quot;repressive, un-representative martial law regime&quot;.

Until the government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, &quot;Islamic activists&quot; were frustrated by the lack of &quot;teeth&quot; to enforce Islamic law in Pakistan&#x27;s constitution. For example, in the 1956 constitution, the state did not enforce &quot;Islamic moral standards&quot; but &quot;endeavor[ed]&quot; to make them compulsory and to &quot;prevent&quot; prostitution, gambling, consumption of alcoholic liquor, etc. Interest was to be eliminated &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.

According to Shajeel Zaidi a million people attended Zia ul Haq&#x27;s funeral because he had given them what they wanted: more religion. A PEW opinion poll found that 84% of Pakistanis favoured making Sharia the official law of the land. According to the 2013 Pew Research Center report, the majority of Pakistani Muslims also support the death penalty for those who leave Islam (62%). In contrast, support for the death penalty for those who leave Islam was only 36% in fellow South Asian Muslim country Bangladesh (which shared heritage with Pakistan). A 2010 opinion poll by PEW Research Centre also found that 87% of Pakistanis considered themselves &#x27;Muslims first&#x27; rather than a member of their nationality. This was the highest figure amongst all Muslim populations surveyed. In contrast only 67% in Jordan, 59% in Egypt, 51% in Turkey, 36% in Indonesia and 71% in Nigeria considered themselves as &#x27;Muslim first&#x27; rather than a member of their own nationality.

&quot;Islamic activists&quot; such as much or the ulama (Islamic clerics) and Jamaat-e-Islami (Islamist party), support the expansion of &quot;Islamic law and Islamic practices&quot;. &quot;Islamic Modernists&quot; are lukewarm to this expansion and &quot;some may even advocate development along the secularist lines of the West.&quot;

===Islamic way of life===
The mosque is an important religious as well as social institution in Pakistan. Many rituals and ceremonies are celebrated according to Islamic calendar.

==Denominations==

According to the CIA World Factbook and Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, 96–97% of the total population of Pakistan is Muslim.

===Sunni===
The majority of the Pakistani Muslims belong to Sunni Islam. Muslims belong to different schools which are called Madhahib (singular: Madhhab) i.e., schools of jurisprudence (also &#x27;Maktab-e-Fikr&#x27; (School of Thought) in Urdu).) Estimates on the Sunni population in Pakistan range from 85% to 90%.

====Barelvi and Deobandi Sunni Muslims====
The two major Sunni sects in Pakistan are the Barelvi movement and Deobandi movement. Statistics regarding Pakistan&#x27;s sects and sub-sects have been called &quot;tenuous&quot;, but estimates of the sizes of the two groups give a slight majority of Pakistan&#x27;s population to 50% the Barelvi school, while 20% are thought to follow the Deobandi school of jurisprudence.

===Shia===

Shias are estimated to constitute about 10-15 percent of the country&#x27;s population. Major traditions of Shia Islam found in Pakistan include the Twelver Shias (or Ithna Ashariyyah) and the Ismaili Shias (or Seveners); most notably the Dawoodi Bohras and the Khoja Ismailis—known for their prominence in commerce and industry.

Many prominent Shia Muslim politicians were known to play a decisive role in the creation of Pakistan for decades during the Pakistan Movement. The role as the first president of the Muslim League and its main financial backer during its earlier years was undertaken by Sir Aga Khan III, an Ismaili by faith. Other politicians that held prominent roles in the initial decades of the Muslim League include Raja Sahib, Syed Ameer Ali and Syed Wazir Hasan, among others.

A 2012 study found 50% of surveyed Pakistanis considered Shia as Muslims while 41% rejected (Shia as muslims). Shias allege discrimination by the Pakistani government since 1948, claiming that Sunnis are given preference in business, official positions and administration of justice. Attacks on Shias increased under the presidency of Zia-ul-Haq, with the first major sectarian riots in Pakistan breaking out in 1983 in Karachi and later spreading to other parts of the country. Shias have long been a target of Sunni radical groups such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in the country. Sectarian violence became a recurring feature of the Muharram month every year, with sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias taking place on multiple occasions. Since 2008 thousands of Shia have been killed by Sunni extremists according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and violent clashes between the two sects are common.

A subset of Shia in Pakistan are the Hazara ethnic group—which are distinct from other Shi’a due to their language and facial features. Most Hazaras live in Afghanistan, but Pakistan also hosts between 650,000 and 900,000 – and around 500,000 live in the city of Quetta.&lt;ref name=&quot;/minorityrights.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufism===

Sufism is a vast term and many Sufi orders exist within Pakistan where the philosophy has a strong tradition. Historically, the Sufi missionaries had played a pivotal role in converting the native peoples of Punjab and Sindh to Islam. The most notable Muslim Sufi orders in Pakistan are the Qadiriyya, Naqshbandiya, Chishtiya and Suhrawardiyya silsas (Muslim Orders) and they have a large amount of devotees in Pakistan. The tradition of visiting dargahs is still practiced today. Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Data Ganj Baksh (Ali Hajweri) in Lahore (ca. 11th century), Sultan Bahoo in Shorkot Jhang, Baha-ud-din Zakariya in Multan, and Shahbaz Qalander in Sehwan (ca. 12th century) and Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai in Bhit, Sindh and Rehman Baba in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. The Urs (death anniversary) of Sufi saints accounts for the largest gathering upon their shrines held annually by the devotees.

Although, popular Sufi culture is centered on Thursday night gatherings at shrines and annual festivals which feature Sufi music and dance, certain tariqas such as Sarwari Qadri Order, refrain from such traditions and believe in paying visit to the shrines, making prayers or reciting manqabat. Moreover, contemporary Islamic fundamentalists also criticize the popular tradition of singing, dance and music, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of Mohammad and his companions. There have been terrorist attacks directed at Sufi shrines and festivals, five in 2010 that killed 64 people. Presently, the known tariqas in Pakistan have maintained their organisations usually known as tehreeks and have their khanqahs for the dhikr of Allah, as per the old age Sufi tradition.

===Quranists===
Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranist, Quraniyoon, or Ahle Quran, are also present in Pakistan. The largest Quranist organization in Pakistan is Ahle Quran, followed by Bazm-e-Tolu-e-Islam. Another Quranist movement in Pakistan is &quot;Ahlu Zikr&quot;.

===Nondenominational===
Roughly twelve per cent of Pakistani Muslims self-describe or have beliefs overlapping with non-denominational Muslims. These Muslims have beliefs that by and large overlap with those of the majority of Muslims and the difference in their prayers are usually non-existent or negligible. Nonetheless, in censuses asking for a clarification on which strand or rite of Muslim faith they most closely align, they usually answer &quot;just a Muslim&quot;.

==Contemporary issues==

===Blasphemy ===

The Pakistan Penal Code, the main criminal code of Pakistan, punishes blasphemy () against any recognized religion, providing penalties ranging from a fine to death. Pakistan inherited blasphemy laws enacted by British colonial authorities and made them more severe between 1980 and 1986, when a number of clauses were added by the military government of General Zia-ul Haq, in order to &quot;Islamicise&quot; the laws and deny the Muslim character of the Ahmadi minority. Parliament through the Second Amendment to the Constitution on 7 September 1974, under Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, declared Ahmadi Muslims as non-Muslims. In 1986 it was supplemented by a new blasphemy provision also applied to Ahmadi Muslims (See Persecution of Ahmadis). In 2020, the European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS) in a report entitled, &quot;Guilty until proven innocent: The sacrilegious nature of blasphemy laws Pakistan&quot;, recommended wide-ranging changes to Pakistan&#x27;s laws and legal systems.

===Conversions===
There have been conversions to Islam from the religious minorities of Pakistan. The Human Rights Council of Pakistan has reported that cases of forced conversion to Islam are increasing. According to victims&#x27; families and activists, Mian Abdul Haq, who is a local political and religious leader in Sindh, has been accused of being responsible for forced conversions of girls within the province.

<text>Lenny Henry in Pieces is a British stand-up and sketch show by comedians Lenny Henry and Gina Yashere. It aired on BBC One between 2000 and 2003.

The show began with two Christmas specials in 2000 and 2001. The 2000 show won the Golden Rose of Montreux award. This was followed up by a six-part series in March 2002. A second and final series consisting of seven episodes began in March 2003. It was followed by &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot; (2004), which also featured sketches.

The primary feature of the show is the sketches, although Henry has a brief stand-up section in each episode.

==Characters==
&quot;Lenny Henry in Pieces&quot; introduced many new characters, the more notable examples being Donovan Bogarde, a randy OAP who is attracted to and pursues Mrs Johnson. He uses a series of sexual innuendos in each sentence. Gloria is a petrol station cashier who spends her time reading cheap novels, and is annoyed whenever someone requires service. Big Tramp is a homeless man who tries to get money out of people by any means necessary. Weekend Dad is a man called Clive, who only gets to see his son Curtis on the weekend, and is still bitter about it towards his estranged wife. Unsuitable Bloke applies for jobs he is unqualified for and has no hope of getting. He believes the only reason for his rejection is because he&#x27;s a black man, so he ends up getting the job anyway. Uncle Lucas, a friendly pensioner who is everyone&#x27;s friend, but has a seemingly endless supply of compromising stories about people&#x27;s childhoods (though he believes them innocent enough), which leads to (among other things), a politician getting run out of town; a high-ranking policeman being arrested for kidnap; a respected judge being exposed as a former teenage prostitute; an undercover detective being executed by a drugs baron; and an illustrious psychologist being driven to insanity. There is also Didi le Gateau, a French footballer. At the end shows Lenny with a partner (Omid Djalili) trying to be absolutely discreet to avoid certain death (often being shot) until Omid farts and Lenny bursts into peals of laughter (often trying to muffle in between laughs by putting a garment in his mouth) and they end up dead anyway. An example of this is when Lenny and Omid are POWs doing the Great Escape under the noses of the Nazis while a curfew is going on.

The second series introduced new characters including Blaxploitation Pope, who is Lucius T. Kool III, a ghetto brother and leader of the Catholic Church; President Umbukele, who is an expert in diplomacy and acquiring foreign aid, but then spends it all on silly things; bad influence Granddad; and a family of animated polar bears with Brummie accents, who live at Dudley Zoo.

<doc id="1277055" wikidata="Q902356" url="?curid=1277055" title="Micro-encapsulation">
<text>Microencapsulation is a process in which tiny particles or droplets are surrounded by a coating to give small capsules, with useful properties. In general, it is used to incorporate food ingredients, enzymes, cells or other materials on a micro metric scale. Microencapsulation can also be used to enclose solids, liquids, or gases inside a micrometric wall made of hard or soft soluble film, in order to reduce dosing frequency and prevent the degradation of pharmaceuticals.

In its simplest form, a microcapsule is a small sphere comprising a near-uniform wall enclosing some material. The enclosed material in the microcapsule is referred to as the core, internal phase, or fill, whereas the wall is sometimes called a shell, coating, or membrane. Some materials like lipids and polymers, such as alginate, may be used as a mixture to trap the material of interest inside. Most microcapsules have pores with diameters between a few nanometers and a few micrometers. Materials generally used for coating are:
* Ethyl cellulose
* Polyvinyl alcohol
* Gelatin
* Sodium alginate

The definition has been expanded, and includes most foods, where the encapsulation of flavors is the most common. The technique of microencapsulation depends on the physical and chemical properties of the material to be encapsulated.

Many microcapsules however bear little resemblance to these simple spheres. The core may be a crystal, a jagged adsorbent particle, an emulsion, a Pickering emulsion, a suspension of solids, or a suspension of smaller microcapsules. The microcapsule even may have multiple walls.
==Techniques of microcapsule manufacture==

Ionotropic gelation occurs when units of uric acid in the chains of the polymer alginate, crosslink with multivalent cations. These may include, calcium, zinc, iron and aluminium.

Coacervation-phase separation consists of three steps carried out under continuous agitation.
# Formation of three immiscible chemical phases: liquid manufacturing vehicle phase, core material phase and coating material phase.
# Deposition of coating: core material is dispersed in the coating polymer solution. Coating polymer material coated around core. Deposition of liquid polymer coating around core by polymer adsorbed at the interface formed between core material and vehicle phase.
# Rigidization of coating: coating material is immiscible in vehicle phase and is made rigid. This is done by thermal, cross-linking, or dissolution techniques.

=== Interfacial polycondensation ===
In interfacial polycondensation, the two reactants in a polycondensation meet at an interface and react rapidly. The basis of this method is the classical Schotten-Baumann reaction between an acid chloride and a compound containing an active hydrogen atom, such as an amine or alcohol, polyesters, polyurea, polyurethane. Under the right conditions, thin flexible walls form rapidly at the interface. A solution of the pesticide and a diacid chloride are emulsified in water and an aqueous solution containing an amine and a polyfunctional isocyanate is added. Base is present to neutralize the acid formed during the reaction. Condensed polymer walls form instantaneously at the interface of the emulsion droplets.

=== Interfacial cross-linking ===
Interfacial cross-linking is derived from interfacial polycondensation, and was developed to avoid the use of toxic diamines, for pharmaceutical or cosmetic applications. In this method, the small bifunctional monomer containing active hydrogen atoms is replaced by a biosourced polymer, like a protein. When the reaction is performed at the interface of an emulsion, the acid chloride reacts with the various functional groups of the protein, leading to the formation of a membrane. The method is very versatile, and the properties of the microcapsules (size, porosity, degradability, mechanical resistance) can be customized. Flow of artificial microcapsules in microfluidic channels:

=== In situ polymerization ===
In a few microencapsulation processes, the direct polymerization of a single monomer is carried out on the particle surface. In one process, e.g. cellulose fibers are encapsulated in polyethylene while immersed in dry toluene. Usual deposition rates are about 0.5μm/min. Coating thickness ranges . The coating is uniform, even over sharp projections. Protein microcapsules are biocompatible and biodegradable, and the presence of the protein backbone renders the membrane more resistant and elastic than those obtained by interfacial polycondensation.

=== Matrix polymerization ===
In a number of processes, a core material is imbedded in a polymeric matrix during formation of the particles. A simple method of this type is spray-drying, in which the particle is formed by evaporation of the solvent from the matrix material. However, the solidification of the matrix also can be caused by a chemical change.

==Release methods and patterns==
Even when the aim of a microencapsulation application is the isolation of the core from its surrounding, the wall must be ruptured at the time of use. Many walls are ruptured easily by pressure or shear stress, as in the case of breaking dye particles during writing to form a copy. Capsule contents may be released by melting the wall, or dissolving it under particular conditions, as in the case of an enteric drug coating. In other systems, the wall is broken by solvent action, enzyme attack, chemical reaction, hydrolysis, or slow disintegration.

Microencapsulation can be used to slow the release of a drug into the body. This may permit one controlled release dose to substitute for several doses of non-encapsulated drug and also may decrease toxic side effects for some drugs by preventing high initial concentrations in the blood. There is usually a certain desired release pattern. In some cases, it is zero-order, i.e. the release rate is constant. In this case, the microcapsules deliver a fixed amount of drug per minute or hour during the period of their effectiveness. This can occur as long as a solid reservoir or dissolving drug is maintained in the microcapsule.
A more typical release pattern is first-order in which the rate decreases exponentially with time until the drug source is exhausted. In this situation, a fixed amount of drug is in solution inside the microcapsule. The concentration difference between the inside and the outside of the capsule decreases continually as the drug diffuses.

Nevertheless, there are some other mechanisms that may take place in the liberation of the encapsulated material. These include, biodegradation, osmotic pressure, diffusion, etc. Each one will depend on the composition of the capsule made and the environment it is in. Therefore, the liberation of the material may be affected by various mechanisms that act simultaneously.

==Applications==
Applications of micro-encapsulation are numerous. It is mainly used to increase the stability and life of the product being encapsulated, facilitate the manipulation of the product and provide for the controlled release of the contents. 
*Microencapsulation is used to preserve vitamin A from the deteriorating effects of oxygen.
*In other cases, the objective is not to isolate the core completely but to control the rate at which it releases the contents, as in the controlled-release of drugs Ferrous sulfate, a nutritional supplement, is microencapsulated in a way that it passes through the stomach but releases in the intestine. In this way, gastric upset is minimized. Aspirin is treated similarly.
*Some sunscreens are encapsulated in silica gel. One brand is &quot;Eusolex UV-Pearls&quot;. These chemicals are potentially hormone disrupting, so the encapsulation protects the user until the time of application.
*pesticides are dangerous to handle but less so when encapsulated. 
*The problem may be as simple as masking the taste or odor of the core, or as complex as increasing the selectivity of an adsorption or extraction process. In environmental science, a pesticide may be microencapsulated to minimize leaching or volatilization risks. 
* DNA protection from degradation for product tracing and data storage
* Protection of bioactive compounds that are easily degradated under normal environmental conditions.

<doc id="1277057" wikidata="Q394358" url="?curid=1277057" title="Agnar Mykle">
<text>Agnar Mykle (8 August 1915 – 15 January 1994) was a Norwegian author. He became one of the most controversial figures in Norwegian literature in the 20th century.

==Early life==
Born in Norway&#x27;s third largest city, Trondheim, Mykle was often sick as a child. His sickness forced him to stay indoors for most of his childhood. Mykle received a business education from the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) in Bergen where he excelled in his studies. He had attended mercantile high school in Trondheim (Handelsgymnasiet) from which he graduated in 1935. Soon after, he was offered a job as an assistant at his old school. After working diligently, he was offered a job as a principal at a similar school in Kirkenes.

==Literary career==
In the 1940s Mykle was active as journalist and writer in the Norwegian labour movement. He wrote scripts for their election campaign films and plays for amateur theatre groups associated with the labour movement. Mykle debuted as an author in 1948 with &quot;Taustigen&quot;, a collection of short stories. Other short story collections included &quot;Jeg er like glad, sa gutten&quot; (1952), &quot;Kors på halsen&quot; (1958) and &quot;Largo&quot; (1967). His novel &quot;Tyven, tyven skal du hete&quot; (published in English as &quot;The Hotel Room&quot;) was written in (1951). His two subsequent novels, &quot;Lasso rundt fru Luna&quot; (published in English as &quot;Lasso Around The Moon&quot;) (1954) and &quot;Sangen om den røde rubin&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Red Ruby&quot;) (1956) have strong autobiographical tendencies. His last published novel was &quot;Rubicon&quot; (1965), originally thought of as a sequel to the previous two, finishing the tale about Ash Burlefoot.

Three collections of his non-fiction writing were published post-humously in 1997 and 1998, &quot;Mannen fra Atlantis&quot;, &quot;En flodhest på parnasset&quot; and &quot;Alter og disk&quot;.

===Red Ruby controversy===
The publication of &quot;The Song of the Red Ruby&quot; in 1957 ignited what became one of the most famous court cases in Norwegian history. Mykle and his publisher Harald Grieg were accused of writing and publishing immoral and obscene material. Mykle&#x27;s defense attorney was Johan Bernhard Hjort. Mykle and Grieg were both acquitted, but the remaining copies of the book were ordered withdrawn from the market. The Norwegian Supreme Court overturned the ruling on the confiscation in 1958. The court case and the pressure caused by the media attention changed Mykle for the rest of his life, and he became a recluse. No photographs were published of him after 1957 and he chose to associate almost exclusively with friends and family. In the autumn of 1993, however, Mykle had a series of conversations with Nils Kåre Jacobsen, an employee at Mykle&#x27;s publishing house, Gyldendal. These talks were later turned into the book &quot;Mine bøker er musikk: møter med Agnar Mykle&quot; ( - &quot;My books are music: meetings with Agnar Mykle&quot;)

===Financial difficulties===
The translations of &quot;The Song of the Red Ruby&quot; gathered tremendous attention outside of Norway, especially in the United States. Huge sales followed, but Mykle nevertheless had financial difficulties for the rest of his life. His letter exchanges with the Norwegian inland revenue were published in the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot;, and they were as eloquently written as most of his literature output.

==Other interests==

===Puppet theatre activity===
His passions included the puppet theatre, both as a director and puppeteer, and with his wife Jane he published a book about puppet theatre, &quot;Dukketeater&quot;, considered the most important book written about the subject in Norway.

===Musical interests===
Mykle also had an avid interest in music all his life. His father played in a marching band in Trondheim, and Mykle was particularly taken with marches and other band music. His favourite composer of marches was Kenneth Alford.

==Derived works==
In 1970, Annelise Meineche directed a film entitled &quot;Sangen om den Røde Rubin&quot;, but the plot greatly compresses (with significant alterations) both &quot;Lasso rundt Fru Luna&quot; and &quot;Sangen om den Røde Rubin&quot;. The film did not meet with Mykle&#x27;s approval.

==Impact of his work on Norwegian society==
In 1994 the pop band Tre Små Kinesere from Trondheim released what became an instant hit single, a tribute to Agnar Mykle titled &quot;Agnar Mykle&quot;.

Almost ten books have been published in Norway about Mykle and his authorship.

<text>The Museum of Science (MoS) is a nature and science museum and indoor zoological establishment located in Science Park, a plot of land in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, spanning the Charles River. Along with over 700 interactive exhibits, the museum features a number of live and interactive presentations throughout the building each day, along with scheduled film showings at the Charles Hayden Planetarium and the Mugar Omni Theater (New England’s only domed IMAX theater). 

The Museum is a member of the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC) (and President Tim Ritchie serves as Chair of the ASTC Board of Directors) and the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). Additionally, the Museum of Science is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), being home to over 100 animals.

==History==

===Origin and early years===
The museum began as the Boston Society of Natural History in 1830, founded by a collection of men who wished to share scientific interests. Their first meeting was held on February 9, 1830 with seven original members in attendance: Walter Channing, Benjamin D. Greene, George Hayward, John Ware, Edward Brooks, Amos Binney, and George B. Emerson. It was more commonly called the Boston Museum of Natural History in the 19th century, and this name occurs frequently in the literature. In 1862, after the society had gone through several temporary facilities, a building was constructed in the Back Bay area of the city and dubbed the New England Museum of Natural History. 

The museum was located next to the original Rogers Building of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and both neoclassical structures were designed by William G. Preston. The original MIT building was demolished in 1939, but the Natural History Museum building survives today, repurposed as a home furnishings showcase.

A great deal of scientific work was done by the society, especially around geology, and the results of this work can be found in the &quot;Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History&quot; which are now freely available online. A library and children&#x27;s rooms were added to the museum around 1900. It was renamed the Museum of Science in 1939, under the directorship of Henry Bradford Washburn, Jr., a renowned American mountaineer.

The Boston Museum of Natural History of 1830/1864–1945 should not be confused with the private Warren Museum of Natural History (1858–1906, formerly on Chestnut Street in Boston). The contents of the latter collection, including the first intact mastodon, were relocated to the American Museum of Natural History of New York City in 1906.

&quot;Museum Then and Now&quot;, an exhibit of artifacts from the early years of the society, is located near the second floor Blue Wing entrance to the &quot;Theater of Electricity&quot; in today&#x27;s museum.

===Post WWII===
After World War II, the old Museum of Science building was sold, and the museum was relocated, again under the name Boston Museum of Science. Under the leadership of Bradford Washburn, the society negotiated with the Metropolitan District Commission for a 99-year lease of the land on the Charles River Dam Bridge, now known as Science Park. The museum pays $1 a year to the state for use of the land. Construction and development began in 1948, and the museum opened in 1951, arguably the first all-encompassing science museum in the country.

In these first few years, the museum developed a traveling planetarium, a version of which is still brought to many elementary schools in the Greater Boston area every year. They also obtained during these early years &quot;Spooky&quot;, a great horned owl who became a symbol or mascot of the museum; he lived to age 38, the longest any great horned owl is known to have lived. Today, a number of other taxidermed specimens remain on display, teaching children about the animals of New England and of the world.

The Science Park/West End MBTA infill station was opened in August 1955, allowing easier access to the museum by public transportation. The Charles Hayden Planetarium was opened in 1958.

Many more expansions continued into the 1970s and 1980s. In 1999, The Computer Museum in Boston closed and became part of the Museum of Science, integrating some of its educational displays, although most of the historical artifacts were moved to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.

===21st century===
A major renovation and expansion took place during 2005 and 2006. In 2010, the Charles Hayden Planetarium was closed for renovation, and has since reopened.

The main entrance to the museum straddles the border between the cities of Boston and Cambridge, and the boundary is indicated by a marker embedded in the floor inside the museum. In 2013, the Museum of Science was the venue for the first joint session of the Boston and Cambridge city councils, to discuss policy measures to improve retention of talented recent university graduates in the area.
Starting in 2013, the Museum of Science undertook a major renovation to upgrade its physical structure, and to develop new educational content. A $250 million campaign upgraded nearly half of the exhibit halls from 2012, and opened three new major exhibits: the &quot;Hall of Human Life&quot;, the &quot;Yawkey Gallery on the Charles River&quot;, and &quot;What Is Technology?&quot; The &quot;Hall of Human Life&quot; opened in November 2013 in the newly expanded Level 2 of the Green Wing, and has a focus on human biology. The audio kinetic sculpture &quot;Archimedean Excogitation&quot; was moved to the atrium to make way for a new exhibit in the lower lobby called the &quot;Yawkey Gallery on the Charles River&quot;. This exhibit opened in 2016, creating a new entry to the museum with better views of the Charles River and Boston-Cambridge skyline.

===Future===
On October 18, 2016 former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg revealed that his foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, would donate $50 million to the museum, the largest gift in the institution&#x27;s 186-year history. He grew up in nearby Medford, and his donation is focused on expanding the educational programs of the museum.

In 2024, the museum started construction of a Public Science Common, to be located where the Cahners Auditorium previously existed. This is a new, flexible meeting space enclosed in glass, and replaces an earlier windowless physical volume which had turned a blank wall to the Charles River. The new space will serve as a central hub for three Centers for Public Science Learning -- the Center for Life Sciences, the Center for the Environment, and the Center for Space Sciences. Lead funding is by Bloomberg Philanthropies, and the project is planned for completion in 2026.

In front of the museum, a memorial to Leonard Nimoy, the television and movie actor who grew up nearby in the West End of Boston, is planned for installation. The monumental sculpture will be a larger-than-life representation of a hand displaying Nimoy&#x27;s iconic &quot;live long and prosper&quot; gesture. Co-sponsored by Nimoy&#x27;s family, the project is at least 75% funded .

==Live presentations and programs==
The museum offers many free live presentations to visitors, including hands-on demonstrations and live animal show-and-tell sessions. The museum houses over 100 live animals, and is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Live animals shown have included tarantulas, hissing cockroaches, and axolotls, as well as better-known birds and furry mammals, many of which the museum gained after they were surrendered, confiscated, rescued, or rehabilitated. 

The MoS has extensive educational programs from pre-school up through adult programming, including lecture series, concerts, films, workshops, and public policy discussions.

Special &quot;overnight&quot; programs invite students in grades 1–7, as well as Scout groups, to spend a night at the museum.

== Engineering Design Workshop ==
Engineering Design Workshop is an exhibit on the first level in the Blue Wing that sees about 200–800 visitors a day. It includes various different design challenges and other more one-on-one &quot;cart activities&quot; for visitors. The design center includes about a dozen activities for visitors to attempt while learning about the engineering process run twice a day from 10am-12pm and from 2pm–4pm during the school year, and also 4:30pm–6:30pm during the summer. The cart activities include robotics and circuitry and are more meant for teaching visitors about new technology. All activities also include a magnet for visitors who attempted the activities.

==Notable past exhibits==

* In the 1950s, a small Wilson cloud chamber was featured in the main entrance hall. Visitors could come within inches of radioactive material to watch the vapor trails of the particles they emitted.
* The first Fresnel lens using electricity in the US (removed from the Navesink lighthouse), was on display from the early 1950s until 1979.
* From 1969 to 1985, the museum borrowed a steam locomotive—Boston and Maine 3713—from Steamtown, U.S.A., and it was exhibited outside the museum’s building. The museum ended their lease on the locomotive to allow room for expansion.
* In 1988, the museum was host to an exhibit focusing on the life and times of Ramses II. The exhibit displayed more than 70 artifacts, on loan from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Arguably, the centerpiece of the exhibit was a 40-foot-tall model of an Egyptian temple which housed a 3,000-year-old, 57-ton granite statue of Ramses. The exhibit ran from May 7, 1988 through August 30, 1988.
* From August to October 2004, the museum was host to the US premiere of &quot;The Lord of the Rings the Motion Picture Trilogy the Exhibition&quot;, developed by the Te Papa museum in New Zealand, and containing many of the costumes and props from the films.
* The Museum of Science built and designed its own film-based exhibit, entitled &quot;Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination&quot;. It was on display there from October 2005 to April 2006, and traveled to other venues.
* &quot;Gunther von Hagens&#x27; Body Worlds 2: The Anatomical Exhibition of Real Human Bodies&quot; was at the Museum of Science from July 29, 2006 to January 7, 2007.
* &quot;Harry Potter: The Exhibition&quot; was at the museum from October 25, 2009 to February 21, 2010.
* &quot;The Science Behind Pixar&quot; is a exhibition which toured around the US. Created by the Museum of Science in collaboration with Pixar Animation Studios, this exhibit featured activities, videos, and images that illustrated the math, computer science, and physical science that go into making computer-animated films.
* &quot;Discovery Center&quot;: offered the opportunity for young visitors to talk with scientists and participate in experiments

==Computing exhibits==

Although the history artifacts of The Computer Museum (TCM) were moved from Boston to Silicon Valley to become the core of the current Computer History Museum, some former TCM educational exhibits and objects were transferred to the Boston Museum of Science where two new computing and technology exhibits were created. &quot;The Computing Revolution,&quot; an exhibit no longer on display at the Museum of Science, related the history of computing through a variety of hands-on interactive exhibits. &quot;Cahners ComputerPlace, &quot;previously located in the Blue Wing, Level 1, housed displays ranging from educational video games to an interactive AIBO ERS-7 robot. The first integrated quantum computing system, developed by MOS Director of Strategic Projects Carol Lynn Albert in collaboration with IBM, is on display as part of MOS&#x27;s computing exhibits.

==Other attractions==
* In 1997, the museum developed a permanent to-scale community Solar System model that physically spanned as far as the Riverside MBTA station (in Newton, Massachusetts). This model was featured in the first episode of the PBS Kids show &quot;FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman&quot;, where several children participate in a scavenger hunt to find all of the bronze model planets (including the former ninth planet Pluto, as the show premiered before Pluto was downgraded), scattered all throughout Greater Boston. The bronze models of the Sun, Mercury, and Venus were located on the museum grounds. However, in 2015 several of the scale models were removed from their original locations, and their current status is unknown . , only the model of Mars still remained, inside Cambridgeside Galleria Mall. The nearest known surviving scale model is a walkable installation on the third floor of the Infinite Corridor at MIT.
* Construction began on a rooftop Wind Turbine Lab in 2009. The lab tests nine wind turbines from five different manufacturers on the roof of the museum. An exhibit in the Blue Wing, &quot;Catching the Wind&quot;, includes a live data stream on how much electricity each turbine is producing.

<doc id="1277062" wikidata="Q658413" url="?curid=1277062" title="Breadcrumbs">
<text>Breadcrumbs, also known as breading, consist of crumbled bread of varying dryness, sometimes with seasonings added, used for breading or crumbing foods, topping casseroles, stuffing poultry, thickening stews, adding inexpensive bulk to soups, meatloaves and similar foods, and making a crisp and crunchy covering for fried foods, especially breaded cutlets like tonkatsu and schnitzel. The Japanese variety of breadcrumbs is called &quot;panko&quot;.

==Types==

===Dry===
Dry breadcrumbs are made from dry breads which have been baked or toasted to remove most remaining moisture, and may have a sandy or even powdery texture. Breadcrumbs are most easily produced by pulverizing slices of bread in a food processor, using a steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. A grater or similar tool will also do.

===Fresh===
The breads used to make soft or fresh breadcrumbs are not quite as dry, so the crumbs are larger and produce a softer coating, crust, or stuffing. The &quot;crumb&quot; of &quot;breadcrumb&quot; also refers to the texture of the soft, inner part of a bread loaf, as distinguished from the crust, or &quot;skin&quot;.

===Panko===

 is a type of flaky breadcrumbs used in Japanese cuisine as a crunchy coating for fried foods, such as &quot;tonkatsu&quot;. Panko is made from bread baked by passing electrical current through the dough, which yields a bread without a crust, and then grinding the bread to create fine slivers of crumb. It has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in Western cuisine and maintains its texture baked or deep-fried, resulting in a lighter coating. Outside Japan, its use has become more common in both Asian and non-Asian dishes. It is often used on seafood and is typically available in Asian markets, speciality stores, and many large supermarkets.

Panko is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, China, and Vietnam.

====Etymology====
The Japanese first learned to make baked bread from Europeans. The word &quot;パン粉 (panko)&quot; is derived from &quot;pan&quot;, giving the word for bread in Japanese (derived from the Portuguese word &quot;pão&quot; for bread), and &quot;-粉 (-ko)&quot;, a Japanese kanji indicating &quot;flour&quot;, &quot;coating&quot;, &quot;crumb&quot;, or &quot;powder&quot; on occasion, when used as a suffix (as in &quot;komeko&quot;, &quot;rice powder&quot;, &quot;sobako&quot;, &quot;buckwheat flour&quot;, and &quot;komugiko&quot;, &quot;wheat flour&quot;).

==Breading==

Breading (also known as crumbing) is a dry grain-derived food coating for a piece of food made from breadcrumbs or a breading mixture with seasonings. Breading is well suited for frying as it lends itself to creating a crisp coating around the food. Breading mixtures can be made of breadcrumb, flour, cornmeal, and seasoning that the item to be breaded is dredged in before cooking. If the item to be breaded is too dry for the coating to stick, the item may first be moistened with buttermilk, raw egg, egg wash or other liquid.

Breading contrasts with batter, which is a grain-based liquid coating for food that produces a smoother and finer texture, but which can be softer overall.

==In popular culture==
In the fairy tale &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, breadcrumbs are used by Hansel and Gretel to track their footpath. However, the breadcrumbs were eventually eaten by birds, subsequently leading them to become lost in the woods. The popularity of breadcrumbs in the fairy tale led to the use of the word &quot;breadcrumb&quot; as a navigation element that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents.

<text>Wojsko komputowe (, &quot;comput army&quot;) is a type of military unit that was used in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th century and the 18th century.

Until the mid-17th century, Polish forces were divided into permanent units () and supplemental units ( or ), which were created in the time of military needs. In 1652 this distinction ceased, and both types of forces were merged into &quot;wojsko komputowe&quot;.

The etymology of the name is from (account, calculation), and Old Polish &quot;komput&quot;—an army budget which was voted for by the Commonwealth parliament, the Sejm.

&quot;Wojsko kwarciane&quot; was composed from various units, both Commonwealth-born soldiers and foreign mercenaries. The Diet voted to pay for a certain number of infantry and cavalry.

Personnel number (which was kept a state secret) varies, because often the commanders (hetmans) paid for additional manpower themselves. During peacetime, the Commonwealth &quot;komput&quot; army numbered about 12,000 for the Crown (Poland proper) and 6,000 for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During wartime it was increased to around 24,000–40,000 for the Crown and 8,000-22,000 for Lithuania.

In addition, &quot;wojsko kwarciane&quot; was supplemented with peasant-based recruits of &quot;piechota wybraniecka&quot; and from 1653, &quot;piechota łanowa&quot;, registered Cossacks (until 1699), &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot;, royal guard, armies of magnates and cities, and &quot;wojsko ordynackie&quot;.

<text>William Lewis Dayton (February 17, 1807 – December 1, 1864) was an American politician, active first in the Whig Party and later in the Republican Party. In the 1856 presidential election, he became the first Republican vice-presidential nominee when nominated alongside John C. Frémont. The Republican Party lost that campaign. During the American Civil War, Dayton served as the United States Ambassador to France, a position in which he worked to prevent French recognition of the Confederate States of America.

==Early life==
Dayton was born in the Basking Ridge of Bernards Township, New Jersey, to farmer Joel Dayton (1776–1833) and Nancy (Lewis) Dayton (1787–1866). His father worked as a farmer and mechanic, and was not well off, but the extended Dayton family was long prominent in New Jersey. William L. Dayton was the grand-nephew of Elias Dayton and second cousin of Jonathan Dayton. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1825. He then studied law with Peter Dumont Vroom, was admitted to the bar in 1830, and became an attorney in Freehold Township, New Jersey.

==Political career==
In 1837, Dayton was elected to the New Jersey Legislative Council, and he became an associate judge of the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1838. Following the death of U.S. Senator Samuel L. Southard, he was appointed to the United States Senate starting July 2, 1842, and elected to finish the term ending in 1845. As a Senator, Dayton opposed attempts at tariff reduction, arguing it would harm farmers and businesses if enacted. Although he found negotiations for Oregon territory &quot;agreeable,&quot; Dayton condemned the annexation of Texas as an attempt to spread slavery and regarded the Mexican-American War as dishonorable. Following the conflict&#x27;s conclusion, Dayton supported the Wilmot Proviso and voted against the 1850 Compromise, believing it conceded too much to pro-slavery interests. He was re-elected by the New Jersey Legislature as a Whig in 1845 but lost in 1851, ending his service on March 3, 1851.

In 1856, Dayton was selected by the nascent Republican Party as their first nominee for Vice President of the United States over Abraham Lincoln at the Philadelphia Convention. He and his running mate, John C. Fremont, lost to the Democratic ticket of James Buchanan and John C. Breckinridge. Afterwards, he served as New Jersey Attorney General until 1861, when his former rival, President Lincoln appointed him Minister to France. He served from May 1861 until his death in December 1864. His service spanned most of the American Civil War, and Dayton served a key role in preventing French intervention in the War.

==Ambassador==
In France, Dayton was part of a successful lobbying campaign to prevent the government of Napoleon III from recognizing the independence of the Confederacy or allowing Confederate use of French ports.

Dayton died in Paris and was buried in Riverview Cemetery, Trenton, New Jersey.

==Legacy==
His son, William Lewis Dayton Jr. (1839–1897), graduated from Princeton in 1858 and served as President Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s Ambassador to the Netherlands from 1882–1885.

Later, the town of Dayton, New Jersey, was named in his honor. Dayton Street in Trenton, New Jersey, also memorializes him.

<doc id="1277080" wikidata="Q3298529" url="?curid=1277080" title="Chicago Whales">
<text>The Chicago Whales were a professional baseball team based in Chicago. They played in the Federal League, a short-lived &quot;third Major League&quot;, in 1914 and 1915. They originally lacked a formal nickname, and were known simply as the &quot;Chicago Federals&quot; (or &quot;Chi-Feds&quot;) to distinguish them from the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox.

The team came in second in the Federal League rankings in and won the league championship in . They came to an end when the Federal League came to a deal with the National and American Leagues that disbanded all its teams. The Whales are notable as the original occupants of the stadium now known as Wrigley Field, the current home of the Chicago Cubs and the only Federal League stadium still in use.

==History==
The Chicago team played the 1913 initial season of the Federal League, as the new league was formed as an independent minor league. Without a formal nickname, the team was called the Chicago Keeleys in 1913, after manager Burt Keeley. The 1913 Chicago team ended the season in fourth place with a 57–62 record, finishing 17.5 games behind the first place Indianapolis Hoosiers (75–45). The Cleveland Green Sox (64–54), St. Louis Terriers (59–60) Covington Blue Sox/Kansas City Packers (32–45) and Pittsburgh Filipinos (49–71) were the other members of the 1913 six-team Federal League.

As the 1913 season was being played, the Federal League began talks of its future and decided to continue playing with the design of becoming a major league in 1914. Chicago businessman James A. Gilmore was appointed Federal League president, replacing John T. Powers. Gilmore initially secured Charles Weeghman, a wealthy Chicago restaurateur, to become the owner of the Chicago franchise in the Federal League. Gilmore further positioned the league by securing influential owners in Brooklyn, New York and St. Louis, Missouri.

The 1914 Chicago club finished 1½ games behind the Indianapolis Hoosiers in the inaugural major league season for the league. The team lacked a formal nickname and was known simply as the Chicago Federals. Before the start of the season, Weeghman built a stadium for the team, called Weeghman Park, designed by Zachary Taylor Davis, who had previously designed Comiskey Park. He also leased the parcel on which the park stood for 99 years.
For the 1915 season, Weeghman held a public contest to choose a formal nickname for the club. Nearly 300 entries were submitted, and Weeghman chose &quot;Whales&quot;, saying that it &quot;carried a suggestion of athletic prowess and power&quot;, as well as being &quot;absolutely unique as a nickname.&quot; In the league&#x27;s second (and final) season, the Chicago uniforms included the logo of a whale &quot;with its tail flopped high just as if it had destroyed an enemy&quot;, inside a large &quot;C&quot; on their uniform shirts. The Whales won the league championship, finishing with 86 wins and 66 losses, percentage points ahead of the St. Louis Terriers&#x27; 87–67 record.

When Kenesaw Mountain Landis brokered a deal between the Federal League, American League and National League that ended the Federal League&#x27;s existence, Weeghman was allowed to buy a controlling interest in the Cubs. He then merged the Whales with the Cubs and moved the Cubs from West Side Park into his new steel-and-concrete structure. While Weeghman himself was forced out within four years due to financial troubles, the Cubs still play in the park he built to this day, the only Federal League park still in use. It was renamed Cubs Park in 1920 and acquired its present name, Wrigley Field, in 1926.

Many Whales players had American and National League experience, including manager Joe Tinker, Dutch Zwilling, Mordecai Brown, and Rollie Zeider.

As the Federals, they played the first game at Wrigley Field on April 23, 1914, and to mark the park&#x27;s centennial on April 23, 2014, the Cubs wore the Federals&#x27; uniforms.

<text>USCGC &quot;Alex Haley&quot; (WMEC-39) is a United States Coast Guard Cutter and former United States Navy vessel that was recommissioned for Coast Guard duty on 10 July 1999. It first entered service as USS &quot;Edenton&quot; (ATS-1), an on 23 January 1971. In 1995, &quot;Edenton&quot; won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

The conversion from a salvage ship to a Coast Guard cutter involved the removal of the stern towing machine, forward crane, and A-frame, and the installation of a flight deck, retractable hangar, and air-search radar. Additionally, her four aging Paxman diesel engines were replaced with four 16-cylinder Caterpillar diesels.

The cutter was named after author and journalist Alex Haley, the first chief journalist of the Coast Guard, the first African-American to reach the rank of chief petty officer, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of &quot;&quot;. Haley served in the Coast Guard for 20 years.

The vessel&#x27;s current home port is Kodiak, Alaska at the Coast Guard Base Kodiak from where she carries out her Fishery Law Enforcement and Search and Rescue primary missions.

==In fiction==
In the 2007 novel &quot;Robert Ludlum&#x27;s The Arctic Event&quot; by James H. Cobb, &quot;Alex Haley&quot; is the ship that takes the heroes out to the island where a Tu-4 laden with anthrax crashed during the Cold War.

In the 2016 novel &quot;Goliath&quot; by Shawn Corridan &amp; Gary Waid, &quot;Alex Haley&quot; and are the two Coast Guard cutters that respond to the fire aboard and subsequent stranding of a Russian ULCC.

<text>Viking was a series of twelve sounding rockets designed and built by the Glenn L. Martin Company under the direction of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Designed to supersede the German V-2 as a research vehicle, the Viking was the most advanced large, liquid-fueled rocket developed in the United States in the late 1940s, providing much engineering experience while returning valuable scientific data from the edge of space between 1949 and 1955. Viking 4, launched in 1950, was the first sounding rocket to be launched from the deck of a ship.

After twelve flights, the Viking was adapted into the first stage for the Vanguard satellite launch vehicle, which launched America&#x27;s second satellite into orbit in 1958.

== Origins ==
After World War II, the United States Army experimented with captured German V-2 rockets as part of the Hermes program. The number of V-2s available for all research was limited and Hermes was an Army project. The U.S. Navy had the need to develop advanced missiles for both weapons and research purposes. The U.S. Navy issued a contract 21 August 1946 to the Glenn L. Martin Company for a series of 10 large liquid-fueled rockets. The intent was to provide an independent U.S. capability in rocketry, and to provide a vehicle better suited to scientific research. Originally dubbed &quot;Neptune,&quot; it was renamed &quot;Viking&quot; in 1947 to avoid confusion with the Lockheed P-2 Neptune. The Viking was the most advanced large, liquid-fueled rocket being developed in the U.S. at the time.

== Design ==

The Viking was roughly half the size, in terms of mass and power, of the V-2. Both were actively guided rockets, fueled with the same propellant (Ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen), which were fed to a single large pump-fed engine by two turbine-driven pumps. The Reaction Motors XLR10-RM-2 engine was the largest liquid-fueled rocket engine developed in the United States up to that time, producing (sea level) and (vacuum) of thrust. Isp was and respectively, with a mission time of 103 seconds. As was also the case for the V-2, hydrogen peroxide was converted to steam to drive the turbopump that fed fuel and oxidizer into the engine. XLR-10-RM-2 was regeneratively cooled.

Viking pioneered important innovations over the V-2. One of the most significant for rocketry was the use of a gimbaled thrust chamber which could be swiveled from side to side on two axes for pitch and yaw control, dispensing with the inefficient and somewhat fragile graphite vanes in the engine exhaust used by the V-2. The rotation of the engine on the gimbals was controlled by gyroscopic inertial reference; this type of guidance system was invented by Robert H. Goddard amongst others, who had partial success with it before World War II intervened. Roll control was by use of the turbopump exhaust to power reaction control system (RCS) jets on the fins. Compressed gas jets stabilized the vehicle after the main power cutoff. Similar devices are now extensively used in large, steerable rockets and in space vehicles. Another improvement was that initially the alcohol tank, and later the LOX tank also, were built integral with the outer skin, saving weight. The structure was also largely aluminum, as opposed to steel used in the V-2, thus reducing weight.

Vikings 1 through 7 were slightly longer (about ) than the V-2, but with a straight cylindrical body only in diameter, making the rocket quite slender. They had fairly large fins similar to those on the V-2. Vikings 8 through 14 were built with an enlarged airframe of improved design. The diameter was increased to , while the length was reduced to , altering the missile&#x27;s &quot;pencil shape&quot;. The fins were made much smaller and triangular. The added diameter meant more fuel and more weight, but the &quot;mass ratio&quot;, of fueled to empty mass, was improved to about 5:1, a record for the time.

== Flight history ==

=== First model RTV-N-12 (Vikings 1-7) ===

==== Viking 1 ====

On 3 May 1949, after two static firings (11 March and 25 April), the first Viking rocket took off from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Its engine fired for 55 seconds, ten seconds short of the hoped-for maximum of 65, but the rocket flew on course and reached an altitude of —deemed a good start to the program. 

==== Viking 2 ====
Viking 2, launched four months later, also suffered from premature engine cutoff and only made it to . Both had suffered from leaks in their turbines, the intense heat of the steam breaking the seal of the turbine casing. The solution was to weld the casing shut, there being no reason to access the turbine wheel again after a flight.

==== Viking 3 ====
The fix worked, and Viking 3, launched 9 February 1950 and incorporating an integrated (rather than discrete) oxygen tank, reached and could have gone higher. However, after 34 seconds of accurately guided flight, the rocket veered westward and threatened to leave the launch range. Range safety triggered charges in the rocket to separate the nose from the engine, and both tumbled to the ground, where they were recovered for analysis.

==== Viking 4 ====
With successful tests of the engine and guidance systems conducted (though not on the same missions), Viking was deemed ready for its most ambitious test: shipboard launch from the deck of the USS &quot;Norton Sound&quot;. Viking 4 was identical to Viking 3, the first of the series not incorporate design changes to fix a problem on a previous Viking.} On 10 May 1950, from a site in the Pacific Ocean between Jarvis Island and Kiritimati, the fourth Viking became the first sounding rocket ever launched from a sea-going vessel. The flight was perfect, reaching , more than double that reached by Vikings 1 and 3.

==== Viking 5 ====
Viking 5, launched 21 November 1950 carried a vast array of photomultiplier tubes, ionization chambers and Geiger counters, for the detection of radiation across a wide variety of energies and types. The rocket also carried two movie cameras to take high altitude film of the Earth all the way to its peak height of as well as Pirani gauges to measure air densities in the upper atmosphere. 

==== Viking 6 ====

Viking 6, launched 11 December, carried a much lighter payload, but its experiments included a battery of custom built pressure gauges. The rocket underperformed, however, only reaching a maximum altitude of .

==== Viking 7 ====
The first generation of Vikings reached its acme of performance with the flight of Viking 7, the sole Viking launch of 1951. Launched 7 August from White Sands, the rocket set a new world altitude record of .

=== Second model RTV-N-12a (Vikings 8-12) ===

==== Viking 8 ====
In the late spring of 1952, the Naval Research Laboratory team under the management of Milton Rosen prepared to launch the first second-generation Viking (RTV-N-12a), Viking 8, from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The new Viking design was nearly half as wide again as its precursor, affording the highest fuel-to-weight ratio of any rocket yet developed. The tail fins no longer supported the weight of the rocket, as had previously been the case. Now, the Viking rocket rested on the base of its fuselage. This allowed the tail fins to be made much lighter, allowing the rocket to carry a heavier tank without weighing more than the first Viking design.

On 6 June 1952, Viking 8 broke loose of its moorings during a static firing test. After it was allowed to fly for 55 seconds in the hope that it would clear the immediate area and thus pose no danger to ground crew, Nat Wagner, head of the &quot;Cutoff group&quot;, delivered a command to the rocket to cease its thrust. 65 seconds later, the rocket crashed or downrange to the southeast.

==== Viking 9 ====
With lessons learned from the Viking 8 failure, the successful 9 December static firing of Viking 9 was followed on 15 December by a successful launch from White Sands. The rocket reached an altitude of , roughly the same as that of the first-generation Viking 7, launched in 1950. In addition to cameras that photographed the Earth during flight, Viking 9 carried a full suite of cosmic ray, ultraviolet, and X-ray detectors, including sixteen plates of emulsion gel for tracking the path of individual high energy particles. The experiment package was recovered intact after it had secured measurements high in the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere.

==== Viking 10 ====

On 25 May 1953, Viking 10, originally planned to be the last of the Vikings, arrived at White Sands Missile Range. A successful static firing on 18 June cleared the way for a 30 June launch date, a schedule that had been set months before, before the rocket had even left the Glenn L. Martin Company plant where it had been built. At the moment of liftoff, the tail of Viking 10 exploded, setting the rocket afire. Water was immediately flooded into the rocket&#x27;s base to try to extinguish the fire, but flames continued to burn in the East Quadrant of the firing platform. Half an hour after launch, two of the launch team under manager Milton Rosen were dispatched to put out the fire to salvage what remained of the rocket.

Their efforts were successful but were then threatened by a slow leak in the propellant tank. The vacuum created by the escaping fuel was causing the tank to dimple, with the danger of implosion that would cause the rocket to collapse. Lieutenant Joseph Pitts, a member of the launch team, shot a rifle round into the tank, equalizing the pressure and saving the rocket. Three hours after the attempted launch, the last of the alcohol propellant had been drained from Viking 10. The launch team was able to salvage the instrument package of cameras, including X-ray detectors, cosmic ray emulsions, and a radio-frequency mass-spectrometer, valued at tens of thousands of dollars, although there was concern that the rocket was irreparable.

A thorough investigation of the explosion began in July, but a cause could not be determined conclusively. In a report presented in September, Milton Rosen noted that there had been no similar occurrence in more than 100 prior tests of the Viking motor. It was decided to rebuild Viking 10, and a program for closer monitoring of potential fail points was implemented for the next launch, scheduled for 1954. Ten months of salvage, testing, and troubleshooting followed the failed launch.

On 30 June 1953, the rebuilt rocket was once again ready for launch. A successful static firing took place at the end of April 1954, and launch was scheduled for 4 May. Control issues revealed in the static firing as well as gusty, sand-laden winds caused a delay of three days. At 10:00 am local time, Viking 10 blasted off from its pad at the White Sands Missile Range, reaching an altitude of —a tie with the highest altitude ever reached by a first-generation Viking (Viking 7 on 7 August 1951). Data was received from the rocket for all stages of the flight, and its scientific package, including an emulsion experiment, returned the first measurement of positive ion composition at high altitudes.

==== Viking 11 ====

Viking 11, which was ready for erection on 5 May, also had a successful static test and was ready for launch, 24 May 1954. Again, the countdown went without hold, and Viking 11, the heaviest rocket yet in the series, was launched at 10:00 AM. Forty seconds into the flight, several puffs of smoke issued from the vehicle, but these accidental excitations of the rocket&#x27;s roll jets did no harm. Viking 11 ultimately reached in altitude, a record for the series, taking the highest altitude photographs of the Earth to date. Viking 11 carried a successful emulsions experiment, measuring cosmic rays at high altitudes.

==== Viking 12 ====
The final Viking flight was that of Viking 12, launched 4 February 1955. Reaching an altitude of , the rocket&#x27;s K-25 camera took an infrared picture of the Southwestern United States, from the Pacific coast to Phoenix, just after reaching its apogee.

Parts of Viking 12 were recovered and, along with parts built from the original blueprints, were used to create a full-size cutaway reconstruction of the rocket. This vehicle was donated by the Martin Marietta Corp in 1976 to the National Air and Space Museum, where it is on display.

== Viking into Vanguard ==

The Viking series returned a bonanza of scientific information measuring temperature, pressure, density, composition and winds in the upper atmosphere and electron density in the ionosphere, and recording the ultraviolet spectra of the Sun, The success of the program, at a cost of under $6 million, suggested that, with a more powerful engine and the addition of upper stages, the Viking rocket could be made a vehicle capable of launching an Earth satellite.

In October 1952, the General Assembly of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) adopted a proposal to undertake simultaneous observations of geophysical phenomena over the entire surface of the Earth. The International Geophysical Year (IGY), set for 1957–58, would involve the efforts of a multitude of nations in such farflung regions as the Arctic and Antarctica. In January 1955, Radio Moscow announced that the Soviet Union might be expected to launch a satellite in the near future. This announcement galvanized American space efforts; in the same month, the National Academy of Sciences&#x27; IGY committee established a Technical Panel on Rocketry to evaluate plans to orbit an American satellite.

On 26 May 1955, the U.S. National Security Council also endorsed a satellite program. On 8 June, United States Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson directed Assistant Secretary Donald A. Quarles to coordinate the implementation of a satellite program, with the United States Department of Defense providing the rocket and launch facilities, and the civilian IGY National Committee producing the satellite and its experimental package, the National Science Foundation being intermediary between the two agencies. A committee, under the chairmanship of Homer J. Stewart of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was developed to manage the project to weigh and choose between the available satellite orbiting options. They were Project Orbiter, an Army plan to use a slightly modified Redstone (a ) range surface-to-surface missile developed the prior year) combined with upper stages to put a satellite into orbit, which could be tracked optically., and the NRL plan to develop an orbital capability for the Viking (Project Vanguard).

On 28 July, confident that a satellite could be lofted during the IGY, President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s press secretary, James Hagerty, announced that a satellite would officially be among the United States&#x27; contributions to the IGY. The Soviets responded four days later with their own announcement of a planned IGY satellite launch.

By 9 September, over Stewart&#x27;s objections, the Stewart Committee had chosen Vanguard over Orbiter, citing the Navy&#x27;s impressive planned Minitrack communications technology and network as well as both the civilian nature and the greater growth potential of the Viking/Vanguard rocket. The contract authorizing the construction of two more Viking rockets to continue upper atmospheric research was expanded to include development of the Vanguard rockets. The Viking was thus incorporated as the first stage of NRL&#x27;s three-stage Project Vanguard vehicle which launched the second U.S. satellite in 1958. Vikings 13 and 14, substantially similar to Vikings 8 through 12, were used as suborbital test vehicles (Vanguard TV-0 and Vanguard TV-1) before the first Vanguard vehicle, Vanguard TV-2, became available for test in the fall of 1957.

<text>Haidinger is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southwestern part of the Moon. It was named after Austrian geologist Wilhelm von Haidinger. Just to the southwest of the crater is the small lunar mare named Lacus Timoris. Haidinger lies northwest of the crater Wilhelm and east of the irregular formation Hainzel.

The outer rim of this crater is nearly circular, with slight outward bulges along the western and northeastern parts of the rim. The satellite crater Haidinger B is attached to the exterior of the eastern rim, and Haidinger A lies close to the northeastern rim. There is a small crater-like divot along the southern inner wall. The interior floor has a low ridge in the northern half.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Haidinger.

<text>La Jolla Playhouse is a nonprofit professional theater on the campus of the University of California, San Diego.

==History==
La Jolla Playhouse was founded in 1947 by Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, and Mel Ferrer. In 1983, it was revived under the leadership of Des McAnuff. Since then, the Playhouse&#x27;s repertoire has included 108 world premieres, thirty-two West Coast premieres, and eight American premieres, and has won more than three hundred honors, including the 1993 Tony Award as America&#x27;s Outstanding Regional Theatre. It is supported, in part, by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts Council, the City of San Diego, and the County of San Diego. It was announced on April 10, 2007, that Christopher Ashley would succeed McAnuff as artistic director.

Among the 36 productions that originated at the Playhouse before finding success on Broadway are &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot;, &quot;Come from Away&quot;, &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, &quot;Big River&quot;, Matthew Broderick&#x27;s revival of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, the Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot;, &quot;700 Sundays&quot;, &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;, &quot;Memphis&quot;, &quot;Peter and the Starcatcher&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Redwood&quot; with Idina Menzel which is set to open on Broadway in 2025. 

== Programs ==
La Jolla Playhouse provides a number of Learning &amp; Engagement opportunities for children, teens, and adults interested in theatre arts, both as performers and behind-the-scenes. In addition, the Performance Outreach Program (POP Tour) annually brings a professional, world-premiere production to schools, libraries, and community centers throughout San Diego. There are additional summer theater opportunities through the La Jolla Playhouse Conservatory, student matinees, teen council, and many other in-school workshops and classes.

=== Page to Stage ===
La Jolla Playhouse began the &quot;Page to Stage Play Development Program&quot; in 2001 to facilitate the development of new plays and musicals, offering audiences the rare opportunity to experience the &quot;birth&quot; of a play and take part in its evolution. As a Page to Stage workshop, a production will feature minimal sets and costumes, and will be revised throughout its entire process, including performances. After the performance, audience feedback sessions will provide insight and suggestion for both the creative team and the actors. In the 22 years since the program began, two Page to Stage Productions have gone on to win Tony Awards. Doug Wright&#x27;s &quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Awards for Best Play and Best Leading Actor in a Play (Jefferson Mays); and Billy Crystal&#x27;s &quot;700 Sundays&quot;, a 2004 Page to Stage Production, won the 2005 Tony Award for Special Theatrical Event.

<doc id="1277097" wikidata="Q5575244" url="?curid=1277097" title="Goanet">
<text>Goanet is a mailing list related to the state of Goa, located on the western coast of India. It was started in 1994 and, in 2015, celebrated 21 years of operation. Primarily an email-based network (with smaller operations on Facebook and the web), it has been considered influential in connecting Goans across the globe, especially in the diaspora.

==History==

It was started in 1994 by a (then) 17-year-old student Herman Carneiro, and since then has grown into being the most influential electronic mailing list linked to Goa.

Carneiro studied Chemical Engineering (Northeastern University in Boston), and has an M.Sc. in Control of Infectious Diseases from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. He was at Imperial College, London. He has worked in biomedical research at LeukoSite, Inc. and then at PerSeptive Biosystems, process design at Pharm-Eco laboratories, and capital engineering projects at Kodak. Carneiro was at Whitehead Institute, MIT, where he was a team manager for the Human Genome Project. Later, as part of his Masters-degree program, he designed and carried out a research project for the World Health Organization in Cambodia on sustainable interventions to prevent dengue fever outbreaks in the region. He has also conducted research in new drug discovery at Pfizer, Inc., and has worked for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as an epidemiologist. Herman has also been a keen sportsman and represented Kenya in the East and Central African Junior Tennis Championships in 1992 and 1993.

===Launch===

Goanet was started on 25 August 1994 with approximately 20 members. The mailing list was run from Carneiro&#x27;s university e-mail account. According to Carneiro: &quot;Netters were asked to put a * in their subject line to indicate a message to be posted on the list as opposed to private e-mail. The list grew slowly but steadily. Pretty soon we had 100 members and by that time I could not cope forwarding all the e-mail. So, I requested that a mailing list program be set up for Goanet on my university&#x27;s server. I was successful and Goanet found its home for next 4 years.&quot;

==On the Goacom server==

Goanet had real-time archives on the web, and its membership continued to grow steadily. In 1998, Goanet moved to the Goacom server. This allowed Goanet to expand even further. Carneiro has argued that Goanet (also called Goa-Net and GoaNet earlier) has been &quot;more than a mailing list from the start -- it&#x27;s been a virtual community.&quot;

==Run by volunteers==

Volunteers of Goanet have included Bosco D&#x27;Mello (Canada), Eddie Fernandes (UK), Vivian Coelho (USA), Eustaquio Santimano (Denmark), Sunila Muzawar (UAE), Frederick Menezes (Goa), among others. Among the first members were Jacqueline Carneiro (USA), Jeannette Carneiro (USA), Peter D&#x27;Souza (USA), Maria D&#x27;Souza (USA), Ulysses and Kendy Menezes (Kuwait), Kevin Coutinho, Craig Rodrigues (Canada), Marlon Menezes (US), Brendan Fernandes (Australia), Joanne Fernandes (Australia), Tashlyn Gonzalves (Australia), and Sherwin Nazareth (Australia).

==Outside Goa==

Goanet has a of over 10,000 people each day. In 2004, the network was claiming a membership of &quot;probably... 5200 members, besides others who visit the website&quot; and a readership scattered across some 50 countries worldwide. The list&#x27;s participants, primarily Goans now living outside of Goa have been involved with a number of initiatives, including an attempt to bring computers to more schools in Goa and efforts by the government to study migration from Goa.

==Built awareness==

Goanet has built awareness about expat and environmental issues in Goa. It has also inspired the formation of a number of other cyber ventures (particularly e-mail lists) and has also been active in discussing Goan writing and literature. Prominent posters on the list include JoeGoaUk, who is known to share a number of photographs and news reports on a daily basis from Goa itself. Dr. Alberto G. Gomes has written an academic paper on the interactions on Goanet. (‘Going Goan on the Goa-Net: Computer-mediated Communication and Goan Diaspora’. Social Analysis 45 (1), p 53–66)

In 2012, Goanet announced that it had launched Goanet-Femnet to empower women, and was helping campaign to preserve Goa in conjunction with the Save Goa Campaign, UK.

<doc id="1277102" wikidata="Q7016723" url="?curid=1277102" title="Newark Peppers">
<text>The Newark Peppers, originally known as the Indianapolis Hoosiers, were a Federal League baseball team from 1913–1915. The Federal League (FL), founded in 1913, was a third major league in 1914 and 1915.

==History==
The Federal League began as an independent minor league in 1913. The franchise placed in Indianapolis, Indiana, was called the &quot;Hoosier Feds&quot; or just &quot;Hoosiers&quot;, and won the 1913 league championship. Their ball field the first season was referred to as Riverside Beach or Riverside Park, and newspapers reported its location as &quot;30th Street and Riverside Park&quot;.

When the Federal League declared itself a challenger to the two major leagues in 1914, it retained its franchise in Indianapolis, and built a new facility, Federal League Park. Primarily owned by oil magnate Harry F. Sinclair, the Hoosiers again won the Federal League championship that year with an 88–65 record.

Although the FL had placed a team (the Tip-Tops) in Brooklyn, from the outset Federal League officials felt they could more effectively compete commercially against the American and National leagues by placing a team in Manhattan. All attempts were effectively blocked by principals of the two existing Manhattan teams (the New York Giants and the New York Yankees). Federal League executives decided to relocate the Indianapolis franchise to a major city in the New York metropolitan area, and Newark was chosen. Although the team was named the Newark Peppers (called &quot;The Peps&quot; for short, and initially also &quot;Newfeds&quot;), the team actually played at Harrison Park, in the town of Harrison, New Jersey, across the Passaic River from downtown Newark. (As part of the franchise transfer, Indianapolis outfielder Benny Kauff, who was the Federal League batting champ in 1914, was placed with the Tip-Tops.)

The team finished in 5th place with a won–loss record of 80–72. The Peppers were disbanded when the Federal League went out of business after the 1915 season.

The Peppers were the only major league baseball franchise in New Jersey besides the Elizabeth Resolutes, who played half of the 1873 season in the National Association (the precursor to the National League). The Brooklyn Dodgers played seven &quot;home&quot; games (one against each NL rival) in Jersey City in 1956 and 1957.

Neither Indianapolis or Newark have had a major league baseball team since 1915.

==Notable players==

The team&#x27;s roster included future Baseball Hall of Fame members Edd Roush and Bill McKechnie. Other notable major leaguers on the Peppers included pitchers Ed Reulbach and Cy Falkenberg.

Team infielder Rupert Mills &quot;played&quot; the non-existent 1916 &quot;season.&quot; A clause in his 1915 contract guaranteed him a salary for the following year as long as he continued to show up at the park, suited and ready to play for the team. Mills fulfilled his contractual obligation, coming to the empty park each day and performing a physical workout to remain in playing condition. Mills, who was born in Newark, was also the only native Jerseyan on the team.

<text>Hall is a lunar impact crater in the southeast part of the Lacus Somniorum, a lunar mare in the northeast part of the Moon. It was named after American astronomer Asaph Hall. This feature can be found to the east of the prominent walled plain Posidonius. Just to the south, and nearly attached to the southern rim of Hall is the smaller crater G. Bond.

This crater formation has been significantly disintegrated by smaller impacts around the outer rim, leaving a wall that is deeply notched and incised. There is a gap in the western rim through which the interior has been flooded and resurfaced by layers of basaltic lava. Thus all that remains of the original crater is an irregular, crescent-shaped formation along the southern edge of the Lacus Somniorum. The southern rim is attached to the rough terrain to the south of the mare, and the irregular satellite crater G. Bond G is attached to the southeast rim.

Passing across the open mouth of this crater is the rille named Rima G. Bond (after the nearby crater), a wide cleft in the surface of the mare. This feature begins to the north of Hall and travels to the south-southwest, gradually bending back to the south-southeast. It passes through a section of raised terrain along the southern edge of the mare, and this rise joins the southern rim of Hall and encloses G. Bond.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hall.

<doc id="1277110" wikidata="Q955048" url="?curid=1277110" title="Paul Eddington">
<text>Paul Clark Eddington (18 June 1927 – 4 November 1995) was an English actor who played Jerry Leadbetter in the television sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot; (1975–1978) and politician Jim Hacker in the sitcom &quot;Yes Minister&quot; (1980–1984) and its sequel, &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; (1986–1988). He was a four-time BAFTA TV and two-time Olivier Award nominee. 

==Early life==
Eddington was born at Paddington in London to decorative artist Albert Clark Eddington (1887–1955) and Frances Mary (née Roberts) (1898–1958). He was raised in St John&#x27;s Wood. The family were Quakers – Albert Eddington being related to the Somerset shoemaking Clark family and the scientist Sir Arthur Eddington. (Albert and Sir Arthur were second cousins, both great-grandsons of William Eddington (1755–1806).) Eddington was brought up by his parents with strict family values.

His father had been &quot;emotionally shattered&quot; on his return from the First World War, which led to Eddington being a lifelong pacifist. Eddington attended Sibford School in Sibford Ferris, Oxfordshire. In 1952, he married Patricia Scott.

==Career==
Having registered as a conscientious objector, Eddington began his acting career as a teenager with ENSA during the Second World War. He worked for Sheffield Repertory Theatre, a theatre company based at Sheffield Playhouse. In 1956, he played his first major role on television as the corrupt policeman PC Tom Carr in the &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; episode &quot;The Rotten Apple,&quot; and later that year he became a regular cast member of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. Initially he played minor characters, but in the fourth season (1959–60), he played Will Scarlet.

He had a leading role in &quot;Liberty Bar&quot;, a 1960 episode of the BBC version of &quot;Maigret&quot;, playing Harry Brown, an Australian entrepreneur. He had roles in episodes of &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1963), &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967) and the final episode of &quot;The Champions&quot; (1969). He was a main cast member of the television series &quot;Frontier&quot; (1968). He also had a supporting role in Hammer Films&#x27; &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot; (1968), an episode of &quot;Van der Valk&quot; in 1972, and appeared as a &quot;straight man&quot; (substituting for regular stooge Henry McGee) in a 1976 episode of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;. He also appeared in most episodes of the ATV series &quot;Hine&quot; (1971). In this he played Astor Harris, a member of an arms dealing firm named Pendles. Eddington appeared as civil servant Strand in the last series of &quot;Special Branch&quot; (1974).

===Career peak===
Although he was an actor for all his adult life, it was not until Eddington was in his late forties that he became a household name because of his role in &quot;The Good Life&quot;, first screened by the BBC in 1975, and written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey. The sitcom focuses on a suburban couple who decide to give up conventionally paid work and become self-sufficient in their suburban garden. Eddington was cast as Jerry Leadbetter, a neighbour of the main characters, and Penelope Keith played his wife, Margo. Originally intended as small parts, the Leadbetters soon became essential foils for the two stars. He also appeared in a single episode of another Esmonde and Larbey sitcom, &quot;Get Some In!&quot; in 1977.

Eddington&#x27;s profile was raised further when he played the title role of Jim Hacker in the comedy series &quot;Yes Minister&quot; (1980–1984) and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; (1986–1988). He was shortlisted four times for the BAFTA award for Best Light Entertainment Performance for the series, but he lost out to his co-star Nigel Hawthorne on each occasion.

During 1987 Eddington appeared as Sir Joseph Porter in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in Australia. His last roles included Guy Wheeler, a corrupt property developer in the &quot;Minder&quot; episode &quot;The Wrong Goodbye&quot; (1989); as Richard Cuthbertson alongside &quot;Good Life&quot; co-star Felicity Kendal in the TV dramatisation of &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot; (1992); the voice of Badger in &quot;The Adventures of Mole&quot; and Justice Shallow in &quot;Henry IV&quot; (1995); a BBC adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;. He was reunited with another &quot;Good Life&quot; co-star Richard Briers in a run of the play &quot;Home&quot; in 1994.

Eddington read extracts from Sir Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot; for the award-winning BBC Radio series &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot;; he died midway through the production, and his place was taken by Peter Jeffrey.

===Awards and honours===
Eddington was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1987 New Year Honours.
==Final years and death==
Eddington&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;So Far, So Good&quot;, was published in 1995. On 30 October 1995, five days before Eddington&#x27;s death, the BBC aired an edition of &quot;Face to Face&quot; in which he discussed his life, career and battle with lymphoma. On that show he was asked how he would like to be remembered: 

Eddington had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, known as mycosis fungoides, when he was 28. The ailment was to cause his death eventually, but in the intervening four decades, Eddington and his immediate family kept his condition private. It only became public knowledge in 1994, when Eddington responded to press speculation about his darkening skin and hair loss.

Eddington died in Southwark, London, on 4 November 1995. He and Patricia, his wife of 43 years, had three sons and a daughter.

<doc id="1277119" wikidata="Q286478" url="?curid=1277119" title="Al-Manar">
<text>Al-Manar () is a Lebanese satellite television station owned and operated by the Islamist political party and paramilitary group Hezbollah, broadcasting from Beirut, Lebanon. The channel was launched on 4 June 1991 as a terrestrial channel and in 2000 as a satellite channel. It is a member of the Arab States Broadcasting Union. The station reaches around 50 million people.

The station is considered one of Hezbollah&#x27;s most important global propaganda tools, with the Danish Institute for International Studies describing it as &quot;the very centrepiece of the entire [Hezbollah] media apparatus&quot;.

It is banned in the United States, France, Spain, and Germany, and has run into some service and license problems outside Lebanon, making it unavailable in the Netherlands, Canada, and Australia.

According to the RAND Corporation in 2017, &quot;Al-Manar has an annual budget of roughly $15 million, much of it supplied by wealthy expatriate Lebanese donors and various Iranian community organizations, and income from the sale of its shows.&quot;

==History==

Al-Manar first began terrestrial broadcasting from Beirut, Lebanon on 4 June 1991. The station was located in Haret Hreik in the southern suburbs of Beirut, close to Hezbollah&#x27;s headquarters. Originally, the station had only a few employees, who had studied media in London during the mid-1980s. But almost a year later, Al-Manar was employing over 150 people.

Initially, Al Manar would broadcast five hours per day. Shortly before the 1992 election, it began broadcasting regular news bulletins in order to help Hezbollah attain more votes and spread its message to more people. In 1993, the station expanded its broadcasting to seven hours a day and extended its signal to the southern part of the Bekaa Valley. Ahead of the 1996 Lebanese parliamentary elections, additional antennas were erected in Northern Lebanon and throughout the Mount Lebanon range, so that the station could be viewed not only in Lebanon, but also in western Syria and northern Israel. Broadcasting was extended to 20 hours in 1998 but reduced to 18 hours in 2000 and 24 in 2001.

In 1996, the Lebanese government granted broadcasting licenses to five television stations, not including Al-Manar. Approximately 50 stations were forced to close at the time. Several stations appealed the government&#x27;s decision, but only four of them were finally granted licenses, one of which was Al-Manar. On 18 September, the Lebanese Cabinet decided to grant Al-Manar a license after having been requested to do so by then Syrian president Hafez al-Assad. Al-Manar received the license in July 1997.

It started in this period to embed journalists with Hezbollah fighters, showing video of Israeli casualties, and including Hebrew so Israeli viewers could follow, with the aim of sowing fear among Israeli viewers.

The station&#x27;s website was launched in 1999, at first hosting some recordings of Hassan Nasrallah speeches to a background of religious and nationalist music.

On 24/25 June 1999 the IAF launched two massive air raids across Lebanon. One of the targets was the al-Manar radio station&#x27;s offices in a four storey building in Baalbek which was completely demolished. The attacks also hit Beirut&#x27;s power stations and bridges on the roads to the south. An estimated $52 million damage was caused. Eleven Lebanese were killed as well as two Israelis in Kiryat Shmona. 

===Satellite broadcasting===
During the 1990s, the popularity of satellite broadcasting greatly increased in the Arab world and in Lebanon. The first Lebanese station to use this technology was Future Television, launching Future International SAT in 1994, while LBCI and the Lebanese government followed by launching LBCSAT and Tele Liban Satellite respectively. In order to compete with these emerging stations, and in order to find an international audience, Al-Manar announced its intention to launch a satellite channel on 9 March 2000. Muhammad Ra&#x27;d, a Hezbollah member of parliament and al-Manar&#x27;s largest shareholder, submitted the request to the minister of transmission, which was approved in April 2000. Although the launch of the satellite station was originally planned for July, the date was moved up in order to coincide with the end of the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon on 25 May. This success led other television stations to follow in launching satellite stations, including Murr TV in November 2000, but it was shut down for &quot;violating an election law prohibiting propaganda&quot; – a fate which al-Manar did not meet, although its programming was also considered propaganda by many analysts. ArabSat, a leading communications satellite operator in the Middle East, headquartered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was at first wary about collaborating with al-Manar, because of the station&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a agenda – the two companies agreed, however, that the programming would be adapted to the pan-Arab audience, leading to a slight difference between the local broadcast and the one via satellite. At first, only three hours of satellite programming were broadcast per day, but by December 2000, the station was broadcasting around the clock.

The timing of the satellite launch - covering the Israeli withdrawal and also the start of the Second Intifada - boosted its audience in the Arab world. 

Al-Manar was soon carried by many satellite providers. However, starting with the removal of the station from TARBS World TV in Australia in 2003, many satellite television providers stopped featuring it. Until then the station was featured by the following providers at one time or another:

*Intelsat, broadcasting to North America
*New Skies Satellites NSS-803, Africa and parts of Europe
*ArabSat, Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe, Saudi-owned
*Hispasat, South America
*AsiaSat, Asia
*Nilesat, part-owned by the Egyptian government
*Eutelsat, Europe, North Africa, and Middle East
*SES Astra, Europe
According to the BBC on 26 July 2006, Al-Manar had three satellite signals:
* ArabSat 2B at 30.5 degrees east
* Badr 3 at 26 degrees east
* NileSat 102 at 7 degrees west

By 2004, Al Manar was estimated to hold 10-15 million viewers daily worldwide. 

===2000s: Israeli attacks and global growth===

The station&#x27;s website team expanded in 2004, from four members to thirteen.

During the 2006 Lebanon War, the channel was continuously struck by missiles during Israeli air raids. The Israeli Air Force attacks on 13 July 2006 led to injury of three employees. The attack on Al-Manar&#x27;s facilities shortly followed another strike against the Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut earlier that morning. Despite the attack, the station remained on air, broadcasting from undisclosed locations. The IDF bombed Al-Manar&#x27;s Beirut complex again on 16 July causing fire in the complex and surrounding buildings. The station&#x27;s signal disappeared briefly several times, then continued normal programming.

Human Rights Watch said the bombing of media outlets violates international law when they are not being used for military purposes (&quot;it is unlawful to attack facilities that merely shape civilian opinion; neither directly contributes to military operations&quot;). The incident was condemned by the International Federation of Journalists. The Israel Association of Journalists withdrew from the federation in response, claiming that Al-Manar employees &quot;are not journalists, they are terrorists&quot;. The New York based Committee to Protect Journalists, also expressed alarm over the incident as &quot;it (Al-Manar) does not appear based on a monitoring of its broadcasts today to be serving any discernible military function, according to CPJ&#x27;s analysis.&quot;

The Israeli bombing increased the station&#x27;s popularity:With other channels turning to Al Manar for the latest line from Hizbullah, it could set the regional news agenda and bring viewers to its extensive coverage of the war. Indeed, purely by staying on air, Al Manar could claim a success. According to Israel&#x27;s Market Research, the channel&#x27;s popularity rankings in the Middle East leapt from 83rd to the 10th slot between July 15 and 28. This meant a substantial increase to the estimated 10 million people that tune in daily to its terrestrial and satellite channels in normal times.
In 2006, it began to broadcast online to complement its terrestial and satellite output. By 2008, its website was hosting 100 new items a day, and reaching over 26,000 daily viewers, and as many as 55,000 according to its management. By the end of the 2000s, as well as TV broadcasts in Arabic, Hebrew, French and English, the station&#x27;s website was available in Spanish as well. 

As a result of removal from some satellite services in the 2000s, it signed new deals with smaller satellite providers, e.g. in April 2008 with Indosat, the operator of the Palapa C2 satellite owned by Telkom Indonesia, in which the Indonesian government is the majority shareholder. By 2009, al-Manar was watched by some 18 million people globally. By 2010, its annual budget was $10 million.

===2013 Bahrain crisis===
Iranian-backed Shia groups were involved in demonstrations starting in mid-2011 (as part of the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;) against Bahrain&#x27;s ruling Sunni oligarchy, and al-Manar backed these demonstrations and condemned the government repression of them. In late December 2013, the Lebanese Communication Group that includes Al-Manar apologised for its partisan coverage of the events at a meeting of the Arab States Broadcasting Union. In response, Hebollah forced the Director General of the station, Abdallah Qasir or Kassir (a former MP of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to the Resistance parliamentary bloc), to resign. He went to Iran.

===2020s===
According to Orayb Aref Najjar, after the US assassination of Qasem Soleimani, leader of the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on January 3, 2020, &quot;Al-Manar went on a daily attack on U.S. policy on Iran and the region, promising revenge.&quot;

Al-Manar translates its content into Spanish for circulation in Latin America.

On 25 October 2023, as the 2023 Israel-Hamas war spread to southern Lebanon, Al-Manar reported that its camera operator, Wissam Qassim, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Hasbaiyya, southern Lebanon, alongside two employees of allied website Al Mayadeen, while they slept in chalets used by journalists. The station&#x27;s studios in Dahiyeh, southern Beirut, were hit in Israeli airstrikes in early October 2024.

== Content ==

Al-Manar&#x27;s programming is diverse, including music shows, children&#x27;s programmes and news. The &quot;Washington Post&quot;, said in 2004 that &quot;It heavily covers events involving the Palestinians, and it shows militants setting off explosives and shooting at Israelis and American troops, often to musical accompaniment.&quot; Citing the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the &quot;Post&quot; said it often features Islamic sacred texts and images of martyrdom. According to the Washington Institute&#x27;s 2004 analysis, it consists of 25% music videos and fillers, 25% series and dramas, 25% talk shows, and finally 25% news and family shows. A 2007 analysis described 65% of its content as entertainment and 35% as political.

===Programs===
The news programming includes much footage from the international press. Additionally, as of early 2004, the station subscribed to wire services including Reuters, Associated Press (AP), Agence France Presse, and Deutsche Presse Agentur. As of 2004, the station airs eight news bulletins a day in Arabic in addition to one in English and one in French. AP severed ties with the station shortly after this.

Al-Manar primarily uses Iranian and Syrian government news agencies for news and documentaries. It has had a formal co-operation agreement with IRNA since 2012. On its websites it also republishes material verbatim from Russia&#x27;s state broadcaster RT. It extensively screens Iranian films (which it sees as &quot;culturally in harmony with Arab values and Al Manar’s mostly Shiite audience&quot;) and television series including soap operas, dubbed into (and later more often subtitled in) Modern Standard Arabic, as well as Syrian series.

Several talk shows are regularly aired on al-Manar. According to Avi Jorisch of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the best known of these is &quot;Beit al-ankabut&quot; (&quot;The Spider&#x27;s House&quot;); its title alludes to a metaphor, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah often employs to describe Israel. It is dedicated to uncovering the &quot;weakness of the Zionist entity&quot;, i.e. Israel, and attempts to convince the Arab world that Israel could easily be destroyed, for example, by an increase in the Arab population. Further talk shows include &quot;Hadith al-sa&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;Talk of the Hour&quot;), &quot;Matha ba&#x27;ad&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s Next?&quot;), &quot;Ma&#x27;al Hadath&quot; (&quot;With The Event&quot;), &quot;Bayna Kawsayn&quot; (&quot;Between The Brackets&quot;), &quot;Milafat&quot; (&quot;Files&quot;), &quot;Al-din wa al-hayat&quot; (&quot;Religion and Life&quot;), and &quot;Nun wa al-qalam&quot; (&quot;The &#x27;Nun&#x27; and the Pen&quot;). Guests include well-known journalists, analysts, writers, Lebanese politicians, spokespersons of terrorist groups, and Islamic scholars, who then discuss current religious, political, and cultural, regional and global topics.

Al-Manar often airs music videos and fillers in between full-length programs and during commercial breaks. Much of the music praises Hezbollah and its martyrs or the Palestinian intifada. According to Jorisch, the music videos are generally dedicated to the following seven purposes: the promotion of the Hezbollah, highlighting the importance of armed resistance against Israel, the glorification of martyrdom, spreading of anti-Americanism, denunciation of Israel and Zionism as the embodiments of terrorism, the appeals for the destruction of Israel, and the depiction of the future of Arab youths. The videos are on average three minutes long. The videos are usually professionally produced by the station itself and each usually takes about three to four days to make. The filler material usually consists of appeals to donate money to the Hezbollah, lists of demonstrations taking place worldwide, and slogans in English, Hebrew, or Arabic. 

The station also offers sports broadcasting such as the programs &quot;Goal&quot; and &quot;Tis&#x27;in daqiqa&quot; (&quot;Ninety Minutes&quot;), family programming such as &quot;Al-mustakshifoun al-judud&quot; (&quot;The New Explorers&quot;), &quot;Al-Muslimoun fi al-Sin&quot; (&quot;Muslims in China&quot;), and &quot;Ayday al-khayr&quot; (&quot;Hands of Benevolence&quot;), game shows including &quot;Al-mushahid shahid&quot; (&quot;The Viewer Is the Witness&quot;), where contestants attempt to guess the names of Israeli political and military figures, and &quot;Al-muhima&quot; (&quot;The Mission&quot;) - a game show in the style of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; but with questions on Arab and Islamic history and the victor winning a virtual trip to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and even a children&#x27;s program called &quot;Al-manr al-saghir&quot; (&quot;The Little Manar&quot;), which is in the style of the US show &quot;Mr. Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, targeting three- to seven-year-olds. 

During Ramadan, al-Manar features special programs, many of which are self-produced. In 2001, &quot;Izz al-Din al-Qassam: Qisat al-jihad wa al-muqawama&quot; (&quot;Izz al-Din al-Qassam: A Story of Jihad and Resistance&quot;), a four-part drama based on the life of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, an early-twentieth-century Arab, after whom the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades are named. The 2002 program &quot;Faris bi la jawad&quot; (&quot;A Knight without a Horse&quot; or&quot;The Horseless Rider&quot;), which was produced by an Egyptian, was based on &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, an old Russian antisemitic text claiming a conspiracy of Jews control the world. The 29-part series &quot;Ash-Shatat&quot; (&quot;The Diaspora&quot;), which was aired in 2003, was also based on &quot;The Protocols&quot;; Commissioned by Al-Manar and produced in Syria, its screening on the channel led to the banning of al-Manar in France.

The station archives the complete speeches of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and those of Iranian leader Ali Khamenei. It also promotes Hezbollah social services, for example showcasing public health initiatives.

==Stance==
According to &quot;The SAGE Encyclopedia of Journalism&quot;, &quot;Al-Manar does not claim neutrality but bills itself as partisan to the cause of its constituents, initially, the disadvantaged and poor Shi’ia of [Lebanon&#x27;s] South and the Beka’a valley; later expanded to include the Arab and Islamic worlds.&quot; Its adopted slogan is “The channel for Arabs and Muslims”. In 2001, the station&#x27;s chair, Nayyef Krayyem, said &quot;Al Manar is an important weapon for us. It&#x27;s a political weapon, social weapon, and cultural weapon.&quot;

According to Jorisch, the station manager Mohammad Afif Ahmad (later Hezbollah&#x27;s head of media), said in the 1990s that Al Manar belongs to Hezbollah culturally and politically. As of 2022, its former CEO, Abdallah Kassir, is now a member of Hezbollah&#x27;s governing council.

According to Jorisch, writing in &quot;National Review&quot; in 2004, Al-Manar&#x27;s programming adopts a strongly anti-Israel and anti-US point of view. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah often &quot;calls for &#x27;Death to America&#x27;&quot; on the channel and the Statue of Liberty is depicted &quot;as a ghoul, her gown dripping blood, a knife instead of a torch in her raised hand.&quot; According to Orayb Aref Najjar, this stance is reflected in the language used, for instance calling the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) the &quot;Israeli Occupation Forces&quot; (IOF).Its Hot Topics section lists “The Israeli Enemy” as a search category. Al-Manar calls fighters Israel killed martyrs. Hezbollah fighters often leave archived video wills that explain why they chose martyrdom. The station also archives short video clips of family members or friends of martyrs praising their sacrifice and explaining why it benefits the country. The station glorified its martyrs on Martyr Day on November 11, 2019, with a speech by Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and in song and resistance videos.
According to German public television ARD in 2023, al-Manar broadcasts calls for the destruction of Israel, such as statements from Hamas. Hashem Safieddine, chairman of the Hezbollah Executive Council, used the channel to warn US President Joe Biden, Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister President Netanyahu and the &quot;evil Europeans&quot; about his organization. Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in 2002 that the channel &quot;broadcasts anti-American programming, but its main purpose is to encourage Palestinians to become suicide bombers&quot;, and ARD said in 2023 that some of its content glorifies suicide bombers, and this was also noted in some early reports about the channel; however, a 2006 analysis by the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies said that it was no longer screening this type of content. 

Al-Manar was once described as one of the channels, among other complex reasons, of the spread of Shiism in Syria in the years before 2009. In a 2011 poll, 52% percent of Shia Lebanese identified Al Manar TV as their first choice for news, compared with only 4% of Sunnis and Druze and 1% of Christians.

The station is also closely aligned to Iran. In 2015, Asharq Al-Awsat reported that Nasser Akhdar, a senior manager at al-Manar, was part of a Houthi delegation in peace talks relating to the Yemeni civil war. A 2021 report by the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT), a conservative thinktank at Reichman University, noted that Farahat, now al-Manar CEO and a Hezbollah member is on the board of Tehran-based Islamic Radio and Television Union (IRTVU), described as a soft power operation for the Iranian state.

== Journalistic standards and restrictions ==
Interviewed by Jeffrey Goldberg in 2002, Al Manar&#x27;s news director, Hassan Fadlallah, said that Al Manar does not aim to be neutral in its broadcasting, &quot;Neutrality like that of Al Jazeera is out of the question for us,&quot; Fadlallah said. &quot;We cover only the victim, not the aggressor. CNN is the Zionist news network, Al Jazeera is neutral, and Al Manar takes the side of the Palestinians...He said Al Manar&#x27;s opposition to neutrality means that, unlike Al Jazeera, his station would never feature interviews or comments by Israeli officials. &quot;We&#x27;re not looking to interview Sharon,&quot; Fadlallah said. &quot;We want to get close to him in order to kill him.&quot;

The Israeli government and its supporters have consequently lobbied Western governments to ban it, with Anti-Defamation League, CAMERA, the American Jewish Congress, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Middle East Media Research Institute all campaigning against it and taking credit for some successes in its deplatforming. Their campaigning led to corporations such as Pepsi removing their ads from the station in the mid-2000s, costing it an estimated $2 million in revenue. 

===Allegations of antisemitism and conspiracy theories===

====9/11 Conspiracy theories====

Al-Manar was one of the originators of the myth that Israelis stayed home from the World Trade Center on September 11 2001 due to foreknowledge of the attacks, publishing the story on 17 September.

====Allegations of antisemitic programming====
In the past, Al-Manar TV has aired material deemed antisemitic by Reporters Without Borders as well as Jewish groups, including content based on &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. For example, on 23 November 2004 it transmitted a news programme in which someone presented as an expert on Zionism Al-Manar warned of ng of &quot;Zionist attempts&quot; to transmit AIDS to Arab countries; in 2004 it screened a multi-episode Syrian series that included the blood libel and drew on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. As a result, Jewish groups have campaigned about the station. 

In 2004, the Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France (Crif) complained to France&#x27;s Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel (Higher Audio Visual Council, CSA) that scenes in the Syrian-made series, &quot;Al-Shatat&quot; (The Diaspora), which purported to depict the history of the Zionist movement, portrayed the killing of a Christian child by Jews to use the victim&#x27;s blood. On 13 December 2004, the French Conseil d&#x27;État, the highest administrative court in France, ordered the French-based Eutelsat Satellite organisation (owner of Hot Bird 4, which had transmitted the station) to shut down Al-Manar broadcasts. Initially, Al-Manar defended &quot;Ash-Shatat&quot; as &quot;purely factual&quot;, and said that the French response was political and not legal, influenced by Israel and Jewish lobbies. Later, however, &quot;Al-Manar’s management apologized for airing the series, dropped it, and explained that the station had purchased it without first viewing the entire series, according to Franklin Lamb [in &quot;CounterPunch&quot;].&quot;

In 2002, Jeffrey Goldberg interviewed members of the station&#x27;s staff and reported some of their comments about Jews. He quoted the news director, Hassan Fadlallah, as saying “Many Europeans believe that the Holocaust was a myth invented so that the Jews could get compensation. Everyone knows how the Jews punish people who seek the truth about the Holocaust.” He quoted the director of English-language news, Ibrahim Mussawi, calling Jews “a lesion on the forehead of history.”

====Covid conspiracies====
According to The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, al-Manar &quot;condemned the United States for ‘using’ COVID-19 to ‘undermine’ its adversaries&quot;.

===Restrictions===
====Restrictions in the US====
Al-Manar was designated as a &quot;Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity&quot;, and banned by the United States on 17 December 2004. A US government spokesman said the decision was taken because of &quot;its incitement of terrorist activity&quot;, and that anybody linked to Al-Manar would be refused a visa to enter the US or if present in the US would be subject to expulsion procedures. Al-Manar was also removed from the satellite provider in the US, Intelsat, and Globecast, the TV service that hosted its US programming. Lebanon&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, Farid Abboud, protested: &quot;If you want simply to demonize or eliminate one side, you&#x27;re not going to advance the issue. If you are going to focus on one side simply because of the political message, it&#x27;s unacceptable and it&#x27;s a grave breach of the freedom of speech.&quot;. Reporters without Borders opposed the designation, saying &quot;Some of the anti-Semitic statements broadcast on Al-Manar are inexcusable but putting this TV station in the same category as terrorist groups worries us and does not strike us as the best solution&quot;. The decision was also opposed by the International Federation of Journalists, who called it political censorship, and by French academic and Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson.

In 2006, the US terrorist designation was extended to all Lebanon Media Group outlets, and its financial assets were frozen by the US Treasury. The Treasury said al-Manar had provided support to Palestinian groups defined as terrorist by the US government, including by transfer of tens of millions of dollars to a charity linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

In May 2023, the US government sanctioned and took down a number of Hezbollah-related web domains, including that of Al-Manar TV, after Hezbollah was listed as a terrorist organization by the United States. Al Manar’s Lebanese domain (.lb) remained accessible.

====Broadcasting restrictions====
In October 2003, the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) launched an investigation into it, leading to Al-Manar&#x27;s suspension from the Television and Radio Broadcasting Services PTY (TARBS). The investigation related to accusations that it &quot;broadcast programs that are likely to incite or perpetuate hatred against or gratuitously vilify any person or group on the basis of their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion&quot; and suspicions it might be in breach of Australian Federal anti-terrorism law. TARBS stopped broadcasting al-Manar on 5 November 2003, and went into receivership. In August 2009, Al-Manar received approval for broadcast by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

In November 2004, after the controversy in France about Al-Manar&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Ash-Shatat&quot;, the Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel (CSA) entered into an agreement with the Lebanese Communication Group under which the channel would not air material that would not &quot;respect the political, cultural and religious sensitivities of Europeans&quot; and &quot;not to broadcast programmes likely to cause problems with public order&quot;. Within days, the CSA deemed Al-Manar not to have met this, citing an interviewee accusing Israel of spreading AIDS in the Arab world in November 2004, and a clip “inciting violence” against Israel, leading to the removal of the channel from both Eustat and Arabsat. French officials also cited other broadcasts saying Jews &quot;seek children&#x27;s blood to bake into Passover matzoh.&quot; Other broadcasts cited by the CSA as racist incitement were &quot;Flambeau sur la route de Jérusalem&quot; and &quot;Le Prince du paradis&quot;.

After the U.S. Department of State placed Al-Manar on the Terrorist Exclusion List in December 2004, transmissions to North America via Intelsat&#x27;s satellites were blocked. Javed Iqbal, a resident of New York City, was the first person to charged under this law. He was charged by federal prosecutors with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization by broadcasting Al Manar to American customers via his company HDTV, in exchange for thousands of dollars payment. In a 2008 plea bargain, he agreed to serve a prison term of up to years. Saleh Elahwal, who also operated HDTV, was also charged and went on trial 5 January 2009. Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, says it&#x27;s constitutional for the government to outlaw businesses with direct operational ties to terrorist organizations, and media outlets that directly incite and direct violent action, but in this case, the government is trying to stop the spread of ideas. Mark Dubowitz, who founded the Coalition Against Terrorist Media in part to stop Al-Manar, said Al-Manar was &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot;, although Lieberman disagreed with that metaphor. 

The lack of transmission from Intelsat had the effect of making Al-Manar unavailable in Canada.

In 2005, the Dutch Media Authority &quot;discovered that a satellite owned by New Skies Satellites was carrying Al-Manar and has ordered the company to stop doing so, because the channel did not have the required Dutch licence.&quot; Spanish authorities banned the retransmission of Al-Manar by Hispasat on 30 June 2005 (which effectively prevents its reception not only in the Iberian peninsula but also in South America). In August 2006, France Telecom&#x27;s satellite provider Globecast removed the station from its Asiasat offer of channels.

It was banned in Germany in 2008.

In 2013, Bahrain blocked its website.

In 2015, Arabsat, a satellite operator majority-owned by Saudi Arabia, removed the station from its platform after Nasrallah blamed the Saudi government for a fatal stampede, at the hajj pilgrimage that year.

====Internet and social media====
The channel provides a live feed of its programming on the Internet through its website. This effectively circumvents the bans as Al-Manar is still available in all the areas it does not broadcast to via satellite.

Twitter removed its account in November 2019.

On 22 June 2021, the official Al-Manar website domain as well as dozens of other Arab news network domains related to Iran, Lebanon and Syria were shut down by the government of the United States for spreading disinformation. It was also banned by multiple social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit.

==== Broadcasting via illegal IPTV services and streaming devices ====
According to a 2008 report by the security company NAGRA and the Digital Citizens Alliance, following an investigation into illegal IPTV services and illicit streaming devices, it indicated that 50% of these services include Al-Manar, making it available in countries where the channel has been banned due to links with Hezbollah.

On October 26, 2020, the Digital Citizens Alliance released a video warning of terrorist content that could include several of these illegal services, including Al-Manar.

====Google and Apple applications====
On 25 July 2012, Al Manar launched an application through Apple&#x27;s iTunes app store and Google Play. However, the application was removed from iTunes after four days and Google Play after six. Maha Abouelenein, Head of Communications for the Mena at Google, subsequently stated that &quot;We remove applications that violate our policies, such as apps that are illegal or that promote hate speech&quot; although she added that &quot;We don&#x27;t comment on individual applications – however, you can check out our policies for more.&quot;

According to MEMRI, Al Manar TV subsequently blamed &quot;Israeli incitement against Al Manar TV&quot; as the reason Al-Manar mobile apps were removed by Apple and Google. An Al-Manar TV reporter stated that: &quot;Al Manar TV is once again targeted by America and Israel. The removal of the channel&#x27;s mobile apps from the Google and Apple stores is a new attempt to curb Al-Manar&#x27;s message of resistance. 
According to MEMRI, Al Manar TV Director-General Abdallah Qasir stated that the removal of the apps &quot;indicates that Al Manar TV has the ability to cause great harm to Israel, and that Israel is extremely annoyed by Al Manar becoming so widespread and by its great credibility. Israel cannot even bear to see the Al-Manar icon on smartphones.&quot; Abd Al-Hadi Mahfouz, president of the Lebanese National Media Council, also supported Al-Manar, arguing that: &quot;This move contradicts all laws pertaining to radio and television, to the exercising of media liberties, and to the right of citizens, Western and Arab alike, to information.&quot; Rabi&#x27; Al-Ba&#x27;lbaki, the head of the Lebanese IT Association reportedly called for a boycott of Apple and Google if they do not restore service for Al-Manar&#x27;s applications.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, in a statement issued on 16 August 2012, Al Manar says it is &quot;back on Ipad and Iphone applications via alternative ways, following the campaign carried out by the Jewish Anti-Defamation League to deactivate Al-Manar applications on smart phones at Google Play and apple store&quot;. To avoid distributor policies and control, the new applications were downloadable directly from Al-Manar&#x27;s website, which was hosted by a British server.

In March 2014, Al Manar relaunched their application in Apple&#x27;s iTunes store under the name &quot;LCG.&quot; It launched a new iPhone app in 2016, called &quot;Trust News&quot;.

<text>The Northrop M2-F2 was a heavyweight lifting body based on studies at NASA&#x27;s Ames and Langley research centers and built by the Northrop Corporation in 1966.

==Development==
The success of Dryden&#x27;s M2-F1 program led to NASA&#x27;s development and construction of two heavyweight lifting bodies based on studies at NASA&#x27;s Ames and Langley research centers—the M2-F2 and the HL-10, both built by the Northrop Corporation. The &quot;M&quot; refers to &quot;manned&quot; and &quot;F&quot; refers to &quot;flight&quot; version. &quot;HL&quot; comes from &quot;horizontal landing&quot; and 10 is for the tenth lifting body model to be investigated by Langley.

On March 23, 1966 the M2-F2 made its first captive flight—attached to the B-52 carrier aircraft throughout. The first free gliding flight of the M2-F2 was on July 12, 1966, piloted by Milton O. Thompson. He was dropped from the B-52 carrier aircraft&#x27;s wing pylon at an altitude of and reached a speed of about .

==Operational history==

Before powered flights were undertaken, a series of glide flights were conducted. On May 10, 1967, the sixteenth and last glide flight ended in disaster as the vehicle slammed into the lake bed on landing. With test pilot Bruce Peterson at the controls, the M2-F2 suffered a pilot induced oscillation (PIO) as it neared the lake bed. At the core of this problem was the fact that the wings of the M2-F2 (essentially the body of the aircraft) produced considerably less roll authority than most aircraft. This resulted in less force available to the pilot to control the aircraft in roll. The vehicle rolled from side to side in flight as he tried to bring it under control. Peterson recovered, but then observed a rescue helicopter that seemed to pose a collision threat. Distracted, Peterson drifted in a crosswind to an unmarked area of the lake bed where it was very difficult to judge the height over the ground because of a lack of guidance (the markers provided on the lake bed runway).

Peterson fired the landing rockets to provide additional lift, but he hit the lake bed before the landing gear was fully down and locked. The M2-F2 rolled over six times, coming to rest upside down. Pulled from the vehicle by Jay King and Joseph Huxman, Peterson was rushed to the base hospital, transferred to the March Air Force Base Hospital and then the UCLA Hospital. He recovered but lost vision in his right eye due to a staphylococcal infection.

Portions of M2-F2 footage including Peterson&#x27;s spectacular crash landing were used for the 1973 television series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; though some shots during the opening credits of the series showed the later HL-10 model, during release from its carrier plane, a modified B-52.

Four pilots flew the M2-F2 on its 16 glide flights. They were Milton O. Thompson (five flights), Bruce Peterson (three flights), Don Sorlie (three flights) and Jerry Gentry (five flights).

NASA pilots and researchers realized the M2-F2 had lateral control problems, even though it had a stability augmentation control system. When the M2-F2 was rebuilt at Dryden and redesignated the M2-F3, it was modified with an additional third vertical fin—centered between the tip fins to improve control characteristics.

The M2-F2/F3 was the first of the heavyweight, entry-configuration lifting bodies. Its successful development as a research test vehicle answered many of the generic questions about these vehicles.

<text>Harding is a small lunar impact crater that lies in the Sinus Roris, a bay in the northwest part of the Oceanus Procellarum. Because of its location near the northwest limb of the Moon&#x27;s near side, this crater is viewed at a relatively low angle from the Earth resulting in foreshortening and limiting the amount of detail that can be seen.

This is an isolated formation, making it relatively easy to find. The nearest craters of note are Gerard, farther to the west, and von Braun to the west-southwest. To the northeast of Harding is the smaller crater Dechen.

The rim of Harding has a sharp edge, and is not quite circular, with slight outward bulges to the north and west, and a somewhat angular corner in the southeast. The inner walls have slumped down, producing a ring of material around the interior floor. There is a slight ridge at the midpoint.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Harding.

<text>While a variety of theories have been postulated for the name of Canada, its origin is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word , meaning &#x27;village&#x27; or &#x27;settlement&#x27;. In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona. Cartier later used the word &quot;Canada&quot; to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as &quot;Canada&quot;.

From the 16th to the early 18th century, &quot;Canada&quot; referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River. In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada. These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.

Upon Confederation in 1867, &quot;Canada&quot; was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference, and the word &quot;Dominion&quot; was conferred as the country&#x27;s &quot;title&quot;. By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a &quot;Realm of the Commonwealth&quot;. The government of Louis St. Laurent ended the practice of using &quot;Dominion&quot; in the statutes of Canada in 1951.

The &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;, which brought the constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to &quot;Canada&quot;. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day. The term &quot;Dominion&quot; was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term &quot;federal&quot; had replaced &quot;dominion&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Canada&quot; is now generally accepted as originating from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word (), meaning &#x27;village&#x27; or &#x27;settlement&#x27;. Related translations include &#x27;land&#x27; or &#x27;town&#x27;, with subsequent terminologies meaning &#x27;cluster of dwellings&#x27; or &#x27;collection of huts&#x27;. This explanation is historically documented in Jacques Cartier&#x27;s &quot;Bref récit et succincte narration de la navigation faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI&quot;.

Although the Laurentian language, which was spoken by the inhabitants of St. Lawrence Valley settlements such as Stadacona (modern-day Quebec City) and Hochelaga (modern-day Montreal) in the 16th century, is now extinct, it was closely related to other dialects of the Iroquoian languages, such as the Oneida and Mohawk languages. Related cognates meaning &#x27;town&#x27; include , , and in the Mohawk, Onondaga, and Seneca languages respectively. Prior to archaeological confirmation that the St. Lawrence Iroquois were a separate people from the Mohawk, most sources specifically linked the name&#x27;s origin to the Mohawk word instead of the Laurentian one.

A widespread perception in Canadian folklore is that Cartier misunderstood the term &quot;Canada&quot; as the existing proper name of the Iroquois people&#x27;s entire territory rather than the generic class noun for a town or village. For instance, the Historica Canada&#x27;s &quot;Heritage Minute&quot; episode devoted to Cartier&#x27;s landing at Hochelaga is scripted as having Cartier believe that &quot;Kanata&quot; or &quot;Canada&quot; was the established name of the entire country. This is not supported by Cartier&#x27;s own writings, however—in &quot;Bref récit&quot;, Cartier fully understands the actual meaning of the word (&quot;They call a town Canada&quot;).

While the Saint-Lawrence Iroquoian origin for the name &quot;Canada&quot; is now widely accepted, other theories have been put forth in the past.

=== Iberian origin theory===
The most common alternative theory suggested that the name originated when Portuguese or Spanish explorers, having explored the northern part of the continent and unable to find gold and silver, wrote (&#x27;nothing here&#x27; in Portuguese), or (&#x27;Cape Nothing&#x27; in Spanish) on that part of their maps. An alternative explanation favoured by philologist Marshall Elliott linked the name to the Spanish word , meaning &#x27;glen&#x27; or &#x27;valley&#x27;.

The earliest iterations of the Spanish &quot;nothing here&quot; theory stated that the explorers made the declaration upon visiting the Bay of Chaleur, while later versions left out any identifying geographic detail.

The known Portuguese presence in modern Canadian territory, meanwhile, was in Newfoundland and Labrador. Neither region is located anywhere near Iroquoian territory, and the name &quot;Canada&quot; does not appear on any Spanish or Portuguese maps of the North American coast that predate Cartier&#x27;s visit. No name for the Bay of Chaleur is attested at all in Spanish sources from that period, while the only name for Newfoundland attested in Portuguese sources is , after the region&#x27;s plentiful cod.

In most versions of the Iberian origin theory, the Spanish or Portuguese passed their name on to the Iroquois, who rapidly adopted it in place of their own prior word for a village; however, no historical evidence for any such Iberian-Iroquoian interaction has ever actually been found. Elliott&#x27;s &quot;valley&quot; theory, conversely, was that the Spanish gave their name for the area directly to Jacques Cartier, who then entirely ignored or passed over the virtually identical Iroquoian word. According to Elliott, Cartier never explicitly stated that there was a direct connection between or as the Iroquoian word for &#x27;village&#x27; and &quot;Canada&quot; as the new name of the entire territory, and never accounted for the spelling difference between and &quot;Canada&quot;—and thus the Spanish etymology had to be favoured because the spellings matched. Notably, Cartier never wrote of having any awareness of any preexisting Spanish or Portuguese name for the region either, meaning that Elliott&#x27;s allegation that the derivation was not adequately supported by Cartier&#x27;s own writing on the matter was also true of his own preferred theory.

Franciscan priest André Thevet claimed that the word derived from , an answer reportedly given by Spaniards in the St. Lawrence Valley area when asked what their purpose was; according to Thevet, the phrase meant that they were seeking land or that they were hunting. These words do not actually exist in Spanish, however.

===Minor or humorous theories===
British philologist B. Davies surmised that by the same process which initially saw the First Nations mislabelled as Indians, the country came to be named for the Carnata region of India or that region&#x27;s Kannada ethnic group; however, this theory has attracted no significant support from other academics.

Additional theories have attributed the name &quot;Canada&quot; to: a word in an unspecified indigenous language for &#x27;mouth of the country&#x27; in reference to the Gulf of St. Lawrence; a Cree word for &#x27;neat or clean&#x27;; a claimed Innu war cry of &quot;kan-na-dun, Kunatun&quot;; a shared Cree and Innu word, &quot;p&#x27;konata&quot;, which purportedly meant &#x27;without a plan&#x27; or &#x27;I don&#x27;t know&#x27;; a short-lived French colony purportedly established by a settler whose surname was Cane; Jacques Cartier&#x27;s description elsewhere in his writings of Labrador as &quot;the land God gave to Cain;&quot; or, to a claim that the early French &quot;habitants&quot; demanded a &quot;can a day&quot; of spruce beer from the local intendant (a claim easily debunked by the fact that the &quot;habitants&quot; would have been speaking French, not English).

In their 1983 book &quot;The Anglo Guide to Survival in Québec&quot;, humourists Josh Freed and Jon Kalina tied the Iberian origin theory to the phrase &quot;nada mas caca&quot; (&#x27;nothing but shit&#x27;). No historian or linguist has ever analyzed this explanation as anything more than an obvious joke.

==Canadian==
The demonym &quot;Canadien&quot; or &quot;Canadian&quot; once referred exclusively to the indigenous groups who were native to the territory. Its use was extended over time to the French settlers of New France, and later the English settlers of Upper Canada.

==Colonial usage==
===New France===
European explorer Jacques Cartier transcribed the Saint-Lawrence Iroquoian word (pronounced ) as &quot;Canada&quot; and was the first European to use the word to refer not only to the village of Stadacona but also to the neighbouring region and to the Saint Lawrence River, which he called &quot;rivière de Canada&quot; during his second voyage in 1535. By the mid-1500s, European books and maps began referring to this region as Canada.

&quot;Canada&quot; soon after became the name of a colony in New France that stretched along the St. Lawrence River. The terms &quot;Canada&quot; and &quot;New France&quot; were often used interchangeably during the colonial period.

===British North America===

After the British conquest of New France (including ceding of the French colony, Canada) in 1763, the colony was renamed the Province of Quebec. Following the American Revolution and the influx of United Empire Loyalists into Quebec, the colony was split on December 26, 1791, into Upper and Lower Canada, sometime being collectively known as &quot;The Canadas&quot;, the first time that the name &quot;Canada&quot; was used officially in the British regime.

Some reports from the 1840s suggest that in that era, the word &quot;Canada&quot; was commonly pronounced &quot;Kaugh-na-daugh&quot; rather than its more contemporary pronunciation.

Upper and Lower Canada were merged into one colony, the Province of Canada, in 1841, based on the recommendations of the Durham Report. The former colonies were then known as Canada East and Canada West, and a single legislature was established with equal representation from each. Underpopulated Canada West opposed demands by Canada East for representation by population, but the roles reversed as Canada West&#x27;s population surpassed the east&#x27;s. The single colony remained governed in this way until July 1, 1867, often with coalition governments. A new capital city was being built at Ottawa, chosen in 1857 by Queen Victoria, and became a national capital.

==Selection of the name &quot;Canada&quot;==

At the conferences held in London to determine the form of confederation that would unite the Province of Canada (now Ontario and Quebec), the province of New Brunswick, and the province of Nova Scotia, a delegate from either Nova Scotia or New Brunswick proposed the name &quot;Canada&quot; in February 1867, and it was unanimously accepted by the other delegates. There appears to have been little discussion, though other names were suggested.

===Other proposed names===
While the provinces&#x27; delegates spent little time, if any, in settling on &quot;Canada&quot; as the name for the new country, others proposed a variety of other names:

* Anglia – the medieval Latin name for England
* Albionoria – &#x27;Albion of the north&#x27;
* Borealia – from &quot;borealis&quot;, the Latin word for &#x27;northern&#x27;; compare with Australia
* Cabotia – in honour of Italian explorer John Cabot, who explored the eastern coast of Canada for England
* Colonia
* Efisga – an acronym of &quot;English, French, Irish, Scottish, German, American.&quot; (Some accounts state that the &quot;a&quot; stood for &quot;Aboriginal&quot;, but there was little or no use of that term to describe Indigenous peoples in Canada at the time.)
* Hochelaga – an old name for Montreal
* Laurentia
* Mesopelagia – &#x27;land between the seas&#x27;
* New Albion
* Norland
* Superior
* Tupona – acronym for &quot;The United Provinces of North America&quot;
* Transatlantica
* Ursalia – &#x27;place of bears&#x27;
* Vesperia – &#x27;land of the evening star&#x27;
* Victorialand – in honour of Queen Victoria

Walter Bagehot of &quot;The Economist&quot; newspaper in London argued that the new nation should be called &quot;Northland&quot; or &quot;Anglia&quot; instead of Canada. On these names, the statesman Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee commented, &quot;Now I would ask any honourable member of the House how he would feel if he woke up some fine morning and found himself, instead of a Canadian, a Tuponian or a Hochelegander?&quot;.

==&quot;Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Dominion&quot;==

Working towards the Confederation of Canada, Canada&#x27;s founders deliberated on the official title for their new country, primarily between the &quot;Kingdom of Canada&quot; or the &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot;.

In J. S. Ewart&#x27;s two volume work, &quot;The Kingdom Papers&quot;, it is noted that the following names were considered for the union of British North America: &quot;The United Colony of Canada&quot;, &quot;the United Provinces of Canada&quot;, and &quot;the Federated Provinces of Canada&quot;. Ewart was also an ardent advocate for the formation of &quot;the Republic of Canada&quot;, a position which was rarely expressed in those times.

===&quot;Kingdom of Canada&quot;===

During the Charlottetown Conference of 1864, John A. Macdonald, who later became the first Prime Minister of Canada, talked of &quot;founding a great British monarchy,&quot; in connection with the British Empire. He advocated, in the fourth Canadian draft of the &quot;British North America Act&quot; (BNA Act), the name &quot;Kingdom of Canada&quot;, in the text is said:

Canada&#x27;s founders, led by Macdonald, wished their new nation to be called the &quot;Kingdom of Canada&quot; in order to &quot;fix the monarchical basis of the constitution&quot;. The governor general at the time, The 4th Viscount Monck, supported the move to designate Canada a kingdom; however, officials at the Colonial Office in London opposed this potentially &quot;premature&quot; and &quot;pretentious&quot; reference for a new country. They were also wary of antagonizing the United States, which had emerged from its Civil War as a formidable military power with unsettled grievances because British interests had sold ships to the Confederacy despite a blockade, and thus opposed the use of terms such as &quot;kingdom&quot; or &quot;empire&quot; to describe the new country.

=== Adoption of &quot;Dominion&quot; ===
Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley, Premier of New Brunswick, suggested the term &quot;Dominion&quot;, inspired by Psalm 72:8 (from the King James Bible): &quot;He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.&quot; This is also echoed in Canada&#x27;s motto: &quot;A Mari Usque Ad Mare&quot; (Latin for &#x27;from sea to sea&#x27;).

The term &quot;Dominion&quot; had been used for centuries to refer to the lands held by a monarch, and had previously been adopted as titles for the Dominion of New England and the Dominion and Colony of Virginia. It continued to apply as a generic term for the major colonial possessions of the British Empire until well into the 20th century; although Tilley and the other Fathers of Confederation broadened the meaning of the word &quot;dominion&quot; to a &quot;virtual synonym for sovereign state&quot;. Its adoption as a title for Canada in 1867 served the purpose of upholding the monarchist principle in Canada; in a letter to Queen Victoria, Lord Carnarvon stated:The North American delegates are anxious that the United Provinces should be designated as the &#x27;Dominion of Canada.&#x27; It is a new title, but intended on their part as a tribute to the Monarchical principle which they earnestly desire to uphold.Macdonald, however, bemoaned its adoption. In a letter to Lord Knutsford on the topic of the loss of the use of the word kingdom, Macdonald said:


He added as a postscript that it was adopted on the suggestion of British colonial ministers to avoid offending republican sensibilities in the United States:

Use of the term &quot;dominion&quot; was formalized in 1867 through Canadian Confederation. In the Constitution of Canada, namely the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; (British North America Acts), the preamble of the act indicates:

Moreover, section 2 indicates that the provinces:

===French terms===
The French translation of the 1867 &quot;British North America Act&quot;) translated &quot;One Dominion under the Name of Canada&quot; as &quot;&quot; using &quot;Puissance&quot; (&#x27;power&#x27;) as a translation for &quot;dominion&quot;. Later, the English loanword &quot;dominion&quot; was also used in French.

The Fathers of Confederation met at the Quebec Conference of 1864 to discuss the terms of this new union. One issue on the agenda was to determine the Union&#x27;s &quot;feudal rank&quot; (see &quot;Resolution 71&quot; of the Quebec Conference, 1864). The candidates for the classification of this new union were: (&#x27;the Kingdom or Realm of Canada&#x27;), (&#x27;the Union of Canada&#x27;), and (&#x27;the Dominion of Canada&#x27;).

===Use of &quot;Dominion&quot;===
There are numerous references in United Kingdom Acts of Parliament to &quot;the Dominion of Canada;&quot; and the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; referred to the formation of &quot;one Dominion under the name of Canada&quot;. Section 4 of the BNA Act also declares that: &quot;Unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, the Name Canada shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted under this Act;&quot; this has been interpreted to mean that the title of the country is simply &quot;Canada&quot;. The term &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot; appears in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1871&quot;—the usage of which was &quot;sanctioned&quot;—and both &quot;Canada&quot; and &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot; appear in other texts of the period, as well as on numerous Canadian banknotes before 1935.
Until the 1950s, the term &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot; was commonly used to identify the country. As the country acquired political authority and autonomy from the United Kingdom, the federal government began using simply &quot;Canada&quot; on state documents. Quebec nationalist leaders also objected to &quot;dominion&quot;, arguing that it suggested Ottawa would have control over Quebec.

Under Prime Minister Louis St-Laurent, compromises were reached that quietly, and without legislation, &quot;Dominion&quot; would be retired in official names and statements, usually replaced by &quot;federal&quot;. The St. Laurent government thereby ended the practice of using &quot;Dominion&quot; in the Statutes of Canada in 1951.

The independence of the separate Commonwealth realms was emphasised after the accession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952, when she was proclaimed not just as Queen of the United Kingdom, but also Queen of Canada, Queen of Australia, Queen of New Zealand, Queen of South Africa, and of all her other &quot;realms and territories&quot;. This also reflected the change from &quot;dominion&quot; to &quot;realm&quot;; in the proclamation of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s new titles in 1953, the phrase &quot;of her other Realms and Territories&quot; replaced &quot;dominion&quot; with another mediaeval French word with the same connotation, &quot;realm&quot; (from &quot;royaume&quot;).

With that said, the national holiday of &quot;Dominion Day&quot; kept that name until 1982, when a private member&#x27;s bill to replace the name with Canada Day that had received first reading in May 1980 was unexpectedly passed in the House. In the Senate, Eugene Forsey and the Monarchist League of Canada strongly defended the traditional usage. When a Gallup poll showed 70% of all Canadians favoured the change, the Senate approved the bill without a recorded vote.

The &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot; refers only to &quot;Canada&quot; and does not use the term &quot;dominion&quot;. No constitutional statute amends this name, nor does any Canadian legal document state that the name of the country is anything other than &quot;Canada&quot;. Moreover, official sources of the United Nations system,
international organizations (such as the Organization of American States), the European Union,
the United States, and other polities with which Canada has official relations as a state either consistently use &quot;Canada&quot; as the only official name, affirm that Canada has no long-form name, or affirm that the formal name is simply &quot;Canada&quot;. &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; states that &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot; is the formal name of the country, albeit rarely used now.

The terms &quot;Dominion&quot; and &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot; are still considered to be appropriate, although arcane, titles for the country. The federal government continues to produce publications and educational materials that specify the currency of these titles, although these publications are not themselves legal or official documents.
For instance, in 2008 the Canadian government registered the Maple Leaf Tartan, designed in 1964, with the Scottish Tartans Authority. The tartan&#x27;s alternate name is &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot;.

These terms are also used in a colonial historical sense, having been used to distinguish contemporary (post-1867) Canada from either the earlier Province of Canada or from the even earlier The Canadas and modern history of the current realms. The terms have also been used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though in this usage, &quot;federal&quot; has replaced &quot;dominion&quot;. For example, &quot;The Canadian Almanac&quot; stopped using Dominion of Canada in 1964.

<text>Hargreaves is a lunar impact crater that lies in the eastern part of the Moon, to the east of the Mare Fecunditatis. It is located to the west of the crater Maclaurin, and was previously designated Maclaurin S before being given a name by the IAU in 1979. Just to the southeast is Morley, and to the west is Webb.

This crater has nearly merged with the larger Maclaurin H to the north, and the interior of both formations has been flooded by lava. As a result, Hargreaves is now an amphitheater-like formation with a wide gap in the northern rim. There is a slight notch in the southern rim, and a small craterlet is attached to the western outer rim.

Upper Black Eddy is officially part of Bridgeton Township, which also borders the adjacent borough of Milford, New Jersey via the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission&#x27;s free Upper Black Eddy-Milford Bridge over the Delaware River.

==History==
Upper Black Eddy originates from the Black family, who operated a hotel at this point on the Delaware River and did share part of its unique name with the former village of (Lower Black Eddy) now known as Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania.

The village&#x27;s growth in the early 19th century was due to the opening of the Pennsylvania Canal passing through the village as a result canal-related businesses sprang up quickly, including a shipyard, mule stables, general store and several hotels; the most notable was the Upper Black Eddy Inn. This was later transformed into Chef Tell&#x27;s Manor House, which closed in 2004 and was demolished in 2010.

The Upper Black Eddy portion of the Pennsylvania Canal was also known as &quot;Candy Bend&quot;. Origins of that name are due to the canal boats throwing coal to the residents as they threw candy back to the boats. There is no conclusive evidence to validate this local lore.

Upper Black Eddy has two notable geographic features:

*Ringing Rocks Park. This is a four-acre (16,000 m2) boulder field of weathered Diabase rocks, some of which &quot;ring&quot; much like a bell when struck with a hammer. This park also includes Buck County&#x27;s highest waterfall situated on High Rocks Creek.
*Nockamixon Cliffs. 400 foot shale cliffs overlooking the Delaware River is located within the Delaware Canal State Park.

==Notable people==
* Danny Federici, organ, glockenspiel, and accordion player for Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band
* Leslie Parrish, actress, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;
*Bill White, former Major League Baseball player and executive who later became a New York Yankees sportscaster
* Wolfgang Zuckermann, musician
