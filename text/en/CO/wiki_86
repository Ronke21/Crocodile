<text>Anthony Siragusa (May 14, 1967 – June 22, 2022), nicknamed &quot;the Goose&quot;, was an American professional football player who was a defensive tackle for 12 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and the Baltimore Ravens in the National Football League (NFL). After his football career, he worked as a sideline analyst for NFL games broadcast on the Fox Network from 2003 to 2015. He also hosted various shows on television, such as the home renovation program &quot;Man Caves&quot; on the DIY Network.

==Early life==
Siragusa attended David Brearley High School in Kenilworth, New Jersey. In high school, he played football and was also a member of the wrestling team. He was the New Jersey state wrestling champion with a 97–1 career record. In football, he played defensive line, punted, and place kicked. He had a 39-yard punting average and made 15 of 18 extra point attempts.

==College career==
Siragusa attended the University of Pittsburgh and played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers. He was a starting defensive tackle in his sophomore and junior seasons (1986 and 1987) under head coach Mike Gottfried.

During a practice in April 1988, Siragusa tore his left anterior cruciate ligament, and underwent surgery that forced him to sit out the entire 1988 season. Before his injury, Siragusa was considered a potential first-round draft pick, but afterwards, he was seen as such a risk that he went undrafted in the 1990 NFL draft.

==Professional career==
===Indianapolis Colts===
Siragusa was an undrafted free agent in 1990 and was signed by the Indianapolis Colts as a defensive tackle. He played nose tackle to draw the double teams when the Indianapolis Colts were in a 3–4 defense or 4–3 defense. As a rookie, he appeared in 13 games and started 6 games and recorded 1 sack, 36 total tackles, and 1 fumble recovery. In the 1991 season, he started in 6 of his 13 game appearances and recorded 2 sacks, 1 fumble recovery, and 46 combined tackles. In the 1992 season, he appeared in all 16 games, starting in 12, and recorded 3 sacks and 65 combined tackles. In the 1993 season, he appeared in and started 14 games and recorded 1.5 sacks and 76 combined tackles. In the 1994 season, he appeared in and started all 16 games and recorded 5 sacks, 88 combined tackles, 2 forced fumbles, and 1 fumble recovery. In the 1995 season, he appeared in and started 14 games and recorded 2 sacks, 49 total tackles, and 1 forced fumble. 
Siragusa was a key part of the Colts team that narrowly lost the 1995 AFC Championship Game; after the season, he was unhappy that Colts coach Ted Marchibroda was given a no-raise, no-extension contract offer that he rejected before leaving the team. Siragusa was open about his dislike for new coach Lindy Infante and the team&#x27;s Vice President of Football Operations Bill Tobin. In the 1996 season, he appeared in and started 10 games and recorded 2 sacks, 45 combined tackles, and 1 fumble recovery.

===Baltimore Ravens===
In 1997, Siragusa signed with the Baltimore Ravens, who were being coached by his former coach Ted Marchibroda (which continued until he was fired for Brian Billick in 1999). In the 1997 season, he appeared in 14 games, started 13, and recorded one fumble recovery and 27 total tackles. In the 1998 season, he appeared in and started 15 games, and recorded one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and 41 total tackles. In the 1999 season, he appeared in and started 14 games, and recorded two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, 3.5 sacks, and 36 total tackles. He was a part of the 2000 Baltimore Ravens defense that allowed the fewest total points in NFL history for a 16-game season. In the 2000 season, he appeared in and started 15 games, and recorded one fumble recovery and 27 total tackles. Siragusa was fined $10,000 for an illegal hit on Oakland Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon in the 2000 AFC title game, injuring Gannon’s shoulder. He helped lead the Ravens to their first Super Bowl in franchise history in Super Bowl XXXV where they beat the New York Giants, 34–7. Siragusa retired following the 2001 season, where he had two sacks and 28 total tackles. He finished his career with 562 tackles (416 solo), 22 sacks, five forced fumbles, nine fumble recoveries for 12 yards, and 28 pass deflections in 170 career games.

==Post-playing career==
Siragusa was a sideline reporter and analyst during NFL games on Fox until his firing following the 2015 NFL season. Siragusa usually appeared with Kenny Albert (before Albert, Dick Stockton and Curt Menefee) and Daryl Johnston. In 2015, he was paired with Thom Brennaman and Charles Davis. He appeared as Soprano family associate Frankie Cortese in the TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He partnered up with Michael Romanelli and opened a restaurant chain called Tiff&#x27;s. The original name of the franchise was Tiffany&#x27;s, but after a lawsuit by Tiffany &amp; Co., the luxury jeweler, the name was shortened. He hosted &quot;Man Caves&quot; on the DIY Network. He also hosted a documentary program called &quot;Mega Machines&quot; on The Learning Channel.

Siragusa also played a Russian mobster in the 2002 movie &quot;25th Hour&quot;.

Out of a concern for men with prostate cancer, in 2013 Siragusa began appearing in an ad campaign for Depend for Men, saying, &quot;I decided to go and shoot the commercial and bring a little bit of lightness to [the problem] where guys can talk about it and after I did the commercial you wouldn&#x27;t believe the response.&quot;

Siragusa made a few appearances at his alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh. He was one of several honorary captains during the renewal of the Penn State–Pittsburgh football rivalry in 2016, soon after ending his stint with Fox.

==Death==
On June 22, 2022, Siragusa died in his sleep at his home in the Ortley Beach of Toms River, New Jersey, at the age of 55.

<text>In electromagnetism, electrostriction is a property of all electrical non-conductor or dielectrics. Electrostriction causes these materials to change their shape under the application of an electric field. It is the dual property to magnetostriction.

== Explanation ==
Electrostriction is a property of all dielectric materials, and is caused by displacement of ions in the crystal lattice upon being exposed to an external electric field. The cause of electrostrictive is linked to anharmonic effects. Positive ions will be displaced in the direction of the field, while negative ions will be displaced in the opposite direction. This displacement will accumulate throughout the bulk material and result in an overall strain (elongation) in the direction of the field. The thickness will be reduced in the orthogonal directions characterized by Poisson&#x27;s ratio. All insulating materials consisting of more than one type of atom will be ionic to some extent due to the difference of electronegativity of the atoms, and therefore exhibit electrostriction.

The resulting strain (ratio of deformation to the original dimension) is proportional to the square of the polarization. Reversal of the electric field does not reverse the direction of the deformation.

More formally, the electrostriction coefficient is a rank four tensor (formula_1), relating the rank two strain tensor (formula_2) and the electric polarization density vector (i.e. rank one tensor; formula_3)

:formula_4

The electrostrictive tensor satisfies

:formula_5

The related piezoelectric effect occurs only in a particular class of dielectrics. Electrostriction applies to all crystal symmetries, while the piezoelectric effect only applies to the 20 piezoelectric point groups. Piezoelectricity is a result of electrostrictive in ferroelectric materials. Electrostriction is a quadratic effect, unlike piezoelectricity, which is a linear effect.

== Materials ==
Although all dielectrics exhibit some electrostriction, certain engineered ceramics, known as relaxor ferroelectrics, have extraordinarily high electrostrictive constants. The most commonly used are
* lead magnesium niobate (PMN)
* lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT)
* lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT)

== Magnitude of effect ==

Electrostriction can produce a strain on the order of 0.1% for some materials. This occurs at a field strength of 2 million volts per meter (2 MV/m) for the material PMN-15. Electrostriction exists in all materials, but is generally negligible.

== Applications ==

* Sonar projectors for submarines and surface vessels
* Actuators for small displacements 
* Sensors, provided a bias electric field or pre-stress is present.

<text>James Bradstreet Greenough (May 4, 1833 – October 11, 1901) was an American classical scholar.

==Life==
James B. Greenough was born in Portland, Maine on May 4, 1833. He graduated at Harvard in 1856, studied one year at the Harvard Law School, was admitted to the Michigan bar and practised in Marshall, Michigan, until 1865, when he was appointed tutor in Latin at Harvard. In 1873 he became assistant professor.

He advocated for the admission of women to Harvard, and in 1882 became a director of the society which later founded Radcliffe College.

He married Mary Battey Ketchum in 1860. She died in 1893, and he remarried to Harriet Sweetzer Jenks two years later.

In 1883 he became a professor of Latin, a post which he resigned hardly six weeks before his death at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts on October 11, 1901.

He was survived by two sons; surgeon and cancer specialist Dr. Robert B. Greenough and James Jay Greenough of Noble and Greenough School.

==Works==
Following the lead of Goodwin&#x27;s &quot;Moods and Tenses&quot; (1860), he set himself to study Latin historical syntax, and in 1870 published &quot;Analysis of the Latin Subjunctive&quot;, a brief treatise, privately printed, and in many ways coinciding with Berthold Delbrück&#x27;s &quot;Gebrauch des Conjunctivs und Optativs in Sanskrit und Griechischen&quot; (1871), which, however, quite overshadowed the &quot;Analysis&quot;.

In 1872 appeared &quot;A Latin Grammar for Schools and Colleges, founded on Comparative Grammar, by Joseph H. Allen and James B. Greenough&quot;, a work done with great critical care with Joseph Henry Allen. His theory of cum-constructions is that adopted and developed by William Gardner Hale. In 1872-1880 Greenough offered the first courses in Sanskrit and comparative philology given at Harvard.

His able scholarship was evident in his editing of the Allen and Greenough Latin Series of text-books. Also, he occasionally contributed to &quot;Harvard Studies in Classical Philology&quot; (founded in 1889 and endowed at his instance by his own class) papers on Latin syntax, prosody and etymology — a subject on which he planned a long work on Roman archaeology and on Greek religion at the time of the New Comedy.

He assisted in the founding of Radcliffe College. An able English scholar and an excellent etymologist, he collaborated with Professor George L Kittredge on &quot;Words and their Ways in English Speech&quot; (1901).

<doc id="1303494" wikidata="Q281472" url="?curid=1303494" title="Suffix array">
<text>In computer science, a suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a string. It is a data structure used in, among others, full-text indices, data-compression algorithms, and the field of bibliometrics.

Suffix arrays were introduced by as a simple, space efficient alternative to suffix trees. They had independently been discovered by Gaston Gonnet in 1987 under the name &quot;PAT array&quot; .

 gave the first in-place formula_1 time suffix array construction algorithm that is optimal both in time and space, where &quot;in-place&quot; means that the algorithm only needs formula_2 additional space beyond the input string and the output suffix array.

Enhanced suffix arrays (ESAs) are suffix arrays with additional tables that reproduce the full functionality of suffix trees preserving the same time and memory complexity.
The suffix array for a subset of all suffixes of a string is called sparse suffix array. Multiple probabilistic algorithms have been developed to minimize the additional memory usage including an optimal time and memory algorithm.

== Definition ==
Let formula_3 be an formula_4-string and let formula_5 denote the substring of formula_6 ranging from formula_7 to formula_8 inclusive.

The suffix array formula_9 of formula_6 is now defined to be an array of integers providing the starting positions of suffixes of formula_6 in lexicographical order. This means, an entry formula_12 contains the starting position of the formula_7-th smallest suffix in formula_6 and thus for all formula_15: formula_16.

Each suffix of formula_6 shows up in formula_9 exactly once. Suffixes are simple strings. These strings are sorted (as in a paper dictionary), before their starting positions (integer indices) are saved in formula_9.

== Example ==

Consider the text formula_6=codice_1 to be indexed:
The text ends with the special sentinel letter codice_2 that is unique and lexicographically smaller than any other character. The text has the following suffixes:

These suffixes can be sorted in ascending order:

The suffix array formula_9 contains the starting positions of these sorted suffixes:

The suffix array with the suffixes written out vertically underneath for clarity:

So for example, formula_22 contains the value 4, and therefore refers to the suffix starting at position 4 within formula_6, which is the suffix codice_3.

== Correspondence to suffix trees ==

Suffix arrays are closely related to suffix trees:

* Suffix arrays can be constructed by performing a depth-first traversal of a suffix tree. The suffix array corresponds to the leaf-labels given in the order in which these are visited during the traversal, if edges are visited in the lexicographical order of their first character.
* A suffix tree can be constructed in linear time by using a combination of suffix array and LCP array. For a description of the algorithm, see the corresponding section in the LCP array article.

It has been shown that every suffix tree algorithm can be systematically replaced with an algorithm that uses a suffix array enhanced with additional information (such as the LCP array) and solves the same problem in the same time complexity.
Advantages of suffix arrays over suffix trees include improved space requirements, simpler linear time construction algorithms (e.g., compared to Ukkonen&#x27;s algorithm) and improved cache locality.

== Space efficiency ==

Suffix arrays were introduced by in order to improve over the space requirements of suffix trees: Suffix arrays store formula_24 integers. Assuming an integer requires formula_25 bytes, a suffix array requires formula_26 bytes in total. This is significantly less than the formula_27 bytes which are required by a careful suffix tree implementation.

However, in certain applications, the space requirements of suffix arrays may still be prohibitive. Analyzed in bits, a suffix array requires formula_28 space, whereas the original text over an alphabet of size formula_29 only requires formula_30 bits.
For a human genome with formula_31 and formula_32 the suffix array would therefore occupy about 16 times more memory than the genome itself.

Such discrepancies motivated a trend towards compressed suffix arrays and BWT-based compressed full-text indices such as the FM-index. These data structures require only space within the size of the text or even less.

== Construction algorithms ==

A suffix tree can be built in formula_1 and can be converted into a suffix array by traversing the tree depth-first also in formula_1, so there exist algorithms that can build a suffix array in formula_1.

A naive approach to construct a suffix array is to use a comparison-based sorting algorithm. These algorithms require formula_28 suffix comparisons, but a suffix comparison runs in formula_1 time, so the overall runtime of this approach is formula_38.

More advanced algorithms take advantage of the fact that the suffixes to be sorted are not arbitrary strings but related to each other. These algorithms strive to achieve the following goals:
* minimal asymptotic complexity formula_39
* lightweight in space, meaning little or no working memory beside the text and the suffix array itself is needed
* fast in practice

One of the first algorithms to achieve all goals is the SA-IS algorithm of . The algorithm is also rather simple (&lt; 100 LOC) and can be enhanced to simultaneously construct the LCP array. The SA-IS algorithm is one of the fastest known suffix array construction algorithms. A careful implementation by Yuta Mori outperforms most other linear or super-linear construction approaches.

Beside time and space requirements, suffix array construction algorithms are also differentiated by their supported alphabet: &quot;constant alphabets&quot; where the alphabet size is bound by a constant, &quot;integer alphabets&quot; where characters are integers in a range depending on formula_24 and &quot;general alphabets&quot; where only character comparisons are allowed.

Most suffix array construction algorithms are based on one of the following approaches:
* &quot;Prefix doubling&quot; algorithms are based on a strategy of . The idea is to find prefixes that honor the lexicographic ordering of suffixes. The assessed prefix length doubles in each iteration of the algorithm until a prefix is unique and provides the rank of the associated suffix.
* &quot;Recursive&quot; algorithms follow the approach of the suffix tree construction algorithm by to recursively sort a subset of suffixes. This subset is then used to infer a suffix array of the remaining suffixes. Both of these suffix arrays are then merged to compute the final suffix array.
* &quot;Induced copying&quot; algorithms are similar to recursive algorithms in the sense that they use an already sorted subset to induce a fast sort of the remaining suffixes. The difference is that these algorithms favor iteration over recursion to sort the selected suffix subset. A survey of this diverse group of algorithms has been put together by .

A well-known recursive algorithm for integer alphabets is the &quot;DC3 / skew&quot; algorithm of . It runs in linear time and has successfully been used as the basis for parallel and external memory suffix array construction algorithms.

Recent work by proposes an algorithm for updating the suffix array of a text that has been edited instead of rebuilding a new suffix array from scratch. Even if the theoretical worst-case time complexity is formula_28, it appears to perform well in practice: experimental results from the authors showed that their implementation of dynamic suffix arrays is generally more efficient than rebuilding when considering the insertion of a reasonable number of letters in the original text.

In practical open source work, a commonly used routine for suffix array construction was qsufsort, based on the 1999 Larsson-Sadakane algorithm. This routine has been superseded by Yuta Mori&#x27;s DivSufSort, &quot;the fastest known suffix sorting algorithm in main memory&quot; as of 2017. It too can be modified to compute an LCP array. It uses a induced copying combined with Itoh-Tanaka. In 2021 a faster implementation of the algorithm was presented by Ilya Grebnov which in average showed 65% performance improvement over DivSufSort implementation on Silesia Corpus.

== Generalized suffix array ==

The concept of a suffix array can be extended to more than one string. This is called a generalized suffix array (or GSA), a suffix array that contains all suffixes for a set of strings (for example, formula_42 and is lexicographically sorted with all suffixes of each string.

== Applications ==

The suffix array of a string can be used as an index to quickly locate every occurrence of a substring pattern formula_43 within the string formula_6. Finding every occurrence of the pattern is equivalent to finding every suffix that begins with the substring. Thanks to the lexicographical ordering, these suffixes will be grouped together in the suffix array and can be found efficiently with two binary searches. The first search locates the starting position of the interval, and the second one determines the end position:


n = len(S)

def search(P: str) -&gt; tuple[int, int]:
 Return indices (s, r) such that the interval A[s:r] (including the end
 index) represents all suffixes of S that start with the pattern P.
 # Find starting position of interval
 l = 0 # in Python, arrays are indexed starting at 0
 r = n
 while l &lt; r:
 mid = (l + r) // 2 # division rounding down to nearest integer
 # suffixAt(A[i]) is the ith smallest suffix
 if P &gt; suffixAt(A[mid]):
 l = mid + 1
 else:
 r = mid
 s = l
 # Find ending position of interval
 r = n
 while l &lt; r:
 mid = (l + r) // 2
 if suffixAt(A[mid]).startswith(P):
 l = mid + 1
 else:
 r = mid
 return (s, r)

Finding the substring pattern formula_43 of length formula_46 in the string formula_6 of length formula_24 takes formula_49 time, given that a single suffix comparison needs to compare formula_46 characters. describe how this bound can be improved to formula_51 time using LCP information. The idea is that a pattern comparison does not need to re-compare certain characters, when it is already known that these are part of the longest common prefix of the pattern and the current search interval. improve the bound even further and achieve a search time of formula_52 for constant alphabet size, as known from suffix trees.

Suffix sorting algorithms can be used to compute the Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT). The BWT requires sorting of all cyclic permutations of a string. If this string ends in a special end-of-string character that is lexicographically smaller than all other character (i.e., $), then the order of the sorted rotated BWT matrix corresponds to the order of suffixes in a suffix array. The BWT can therefore be computed in linear time by first constructing a suffix array of the text and then deducing the BWT string: formula_53.

Suffix arrays can also be used to look up substrings in example-based machine translation, demanding much less storage than a full phrase table as used in Statistical machine translation.

Many additional applications of the suffix array require the LCP array. Some of these are detailed in the application section of the latter.

== Enhanced suffix arrays ==
Suffix trees are powerful data structures that have wide application in areas of pattern and string matching, indexing and textual statistics. However, it occupies a significant amount of space and thus has a drawback in many real-time applications that require processing a considerably large amount of data like genome analysis. To overcome this drawback, Enhanced Suffix Arrays were developed that are data structures consisting of suffix arrays and an additional table called the child table that contains the information about the parent-child relationship between the nodes in the suffix tree. The node branching data structure for this tree is a linked list. Enhanced suffix arrays are superior in terms of both space efficiency and time complexity and are easy to implement. Moreover, they can be applied to any algorithm that uses a suffix tree by using an abstract concept lcp-interval trees. The time complexity for searching a pattern in an enhanced suffix array is O(m|Σ|).

The suffix array of the string is an array of n integers in the range of 0 to n that represents the n+1 suffixes of the string including the special character #.

The suffix array is composed of two arrays:

# pos array pos[1...n]: It represents a sorted list of all S suffixes. Only the initial positions of the suffixes are stored in the array to reduce the space complexity since the suffixes are too large.
# lcp array lcp[1...n]: It is an array of n integers that maintains the lengths of the longest common prefix of two consecutive suffixes stored in the pos array.

== Constructing the lcp-interval ==
For a suffix array of S, the lcp-interval associated with the corresponding node of suffix tree of S can be defined as:

&quot;Interval [i..j], 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n is an lcp-interval of lcp-value, if&quot;

&quot;1. lcptab[i] &lt; l,&quot;

&quot;2. lcptab[k] ≥ l for all i + 1 ≤ k ≤ j,&quot;

&quot;3. lcptab[k] = l for some i + 1 ≤ k ≤ j if i ≠ j and l = n − i + 1 if i = j,&quot; 

&quot;4. lcptab[j + 1] &lt; l.&quot;

The length of the longest common prefix of pos[i − 1] and pos[i] is stored in lcp[i],where 2 ≤ i ≤ n. The lcp-interval portrays the same parent-child relationship as that among the associated nodes in the suffix tree of S.This shows that if the corresponding node of [i..j] is a child of the corresponding node of [k..l], a lcp-interval [i..j] is a child interval of another lcp-interval [k..l]. If [k..l] is a child interval of [i..j], a lcp-interval [i..j] is the parent interval of a lcp-interval [k..l].

== Constructing a child table ==
The child table &quot;cldtab&quot; is composed of three n arrays, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot; and &quot;nextlIndex&quot;. The information about the edges of the corresponding suffix tree is stored and maintained by the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; arrays. The &quot;nextlIndex&quot; array stores the links in the linked list used for node branching the suffix tree.

The &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot; and &quot;nextlIndex&quot; array are defined as follows:

# The element &quot;up[i]&quot; records the starting index of the longest lcp-second interval’s child interval, which ends at index &quot;i-1&quot;.
# The initial index of the second child interval of the longest lcp-interval, starting at index &quot;i&quot; is stored in the element &quot;down[i]&quot;.
# If and only if the interval is neither the first child nor the final child of its parent, the element &quot;nextlIndex[i]&quot; contains the first index of the next sibling interval of the longest lcp-interval, starting at index &quot;i&quot;.

By performing a bottom-up traversal of the lcp-interval of the tree, the child table can be constructed in linear time. The &quot;up/down&quot; values and the &quot;nextlIndex&quot; values can be computed separately by using two distinct algorithms.

== Constructing a suffix link table ==
The suffix links for an enhanced suffix array can be computed by generating the suffix link interval [&quot;1..,r&quot;] for each [i..j] interval during the preprocessing. The left and right elements l and r of the interval are maintained in the first index of [i..,j]. The table for this interval ranges from 0 to n. The suffix link table is constructed by the left-to-right breadth-first traversal of the lcp-interval tree. Every time an &quot;l&quot;-interval is computed, it is added to the list of l-intervals, which is referred to as the l-list. When the lcp-value &gt; 0, for every &quot;l&quot;-interval[i..,j] in the list, link[i] is calculated. The interval [&quot;l&quot;..,&quot;r&quot;] is computed by a binary search in(&quot;l&quot;-1)-list, where &quot;l&quot; is the largest left boundary amongst all the &quot;l&quot;-1 intervals. The suffix link interval of [i..j] is represented by this interval[&quot;l..,r&quot;]. The values &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are ultimately stored in the first index of [i..,j].

<text>Scan-Line Interleave (SLI) is a multi-GPU method developed by 3DFX for linking two (or more) video cards or chips together to produce a single output. It is an application of parallel processing for computer graphics, meant to increase the processing power available for graphics.

3DFX&#x27;s SLI technology was first introduced in 1998 with the Voodoo2 line of graphics accelerators. The original Voodoo Graphics card and the VSA-100 were also SLI-capable. However, in the case of the former, it was only used in arcades, as well as professional applications via Primary Image&#x27;s Piranha card, intended for use with simulations using various graphics APIs such as OpenGL, Glide, or Primary Image&#x27;s own Tempest API. Support for the MultiGen OpenFlight Format in particular was specifically advertised.

NVIDIA reintroduced the SLI acronym in 2004 as Scalable Link Interface. NVIDIA&#x27;s SLI, compared to 3DFX&#x27;s SLI, is modernized to use graphics cards interfaced over the PCI Express bus.

==Function==

3DFX&#x27;s SLI design was the first attempt, in the consumer PC market, at combining the rendering power of two video cards. The two 3DFX cards were connected by a small ribbon cable inside the PC. This cable shared graphics and synchronization information between the cards. Each 3DFX card rendered alternating horizontal lines of pixels composing a frame.

<text>Ambev, formally [[Companhia de Bebidas das Américas]] and Companhia Brasileira de Bebidas, is a Brazilian brewing company now merged into Anheuser-Busch InBev. Its name translates to &quot;Americas&#x27; Beverage Company&quot;, hence the &quot;Ambev&quot; abbreviation. It was created on July 1, 1999, with the merger of two breweries, Brahma and Antarctica. The merger was approved by the board of directors of the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) on March 30, 2000. The organization&#x27;s headquarters are in São Paulo, Brazil. It is one of the largest companies by market capitalization in Brazil and in the Southern hemisphere. Belonging to the Anheuser-Busch InBev group, it is the largest beer manufacturer in the world. It controls about 69% of the Brazilian beer market is the 11th largest company in the country in net revenue and is a manufacturer of soft drinks, energy drinks, juices, teas, and mineral water.

It went public in 2004 on the São Paulo Stock Exchange, trading under the ticker ABEV3 on B3.

== Overview ==
Ambev was born from the merger between the then competitors Companhia Antarctica Paulista and Companhia Cervejaria Brahma, from Rio de Janeiro, in 1999. Over the years, the company added new brands and breweries, such as the artisanal brewery Wäls from Minas Gerais and the São Paulo-based Colorado. 

Ambev operates in 18 countries in the Americas and its products include beers such as Antarctica, Bogotá Beer Company, Brahma, Bohemia, Stella Artois and soft drinks like Guaraná Antarctica, Soda Antarctica, Sukita and the innovations H2OH! and Guarah. The second largest PepsiCo bottler outside the United States, it sells and distributes PepsiCo products in Brazil and other Latin American countries, includes Pepsi, Lipton Ice Tea and Gatorade by franchise agreement. According to an analyst at &quot;Share Market Updates&quot; in October 2016, the company operated through Latin America North, Latin America South, and Canada segments.

In 2004, Ambev went public on the São Paulo Stock Exchange, raising approximately R$ 6 billion, with shares traded under the ticker symbols ABEV3 on B3. In 2013, it launched its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker ABEV.

In 2004, Ambev merged with Belgian company Interbrew to form InBev. In 2008, InBev acquired the American company Anheuser-Busch to form Anheuser-Busch InBev. Ambev S.A. is currently a subsidiary of Interbrew International B.V., which is in turn a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.

=== Environmental efforts ===
It has committed to sustainability by setting targets to eliminate plastic pollution in its packaging. The company has invested in eco-friendly alternatives and recycling initiatives to reduce environmental impact.

In 2019, it invested $36 million in building solar plants to power its operations, reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources. This initiative aligns with the company’s commitment to sustainability and lowering carbon emissions.

<text>Gottlieb Christoph Adolf von Harless (; 21 November 1806 – 5 September 1879) was a German Lutheran theologian.

==Life==
He was born on 21 November 1806 in Nuremberg. As a youth, he was interested in music and poetry, and was attracted by ancient and German classical literature, especially by Jean Paul. He was indifferent to Christianity. In 1823 he entered the University of Erlangen, at first studying philology, then law; but he finally tried theology. The teacher who particularly influenced him was Georg Benedikt Winer.

Harless wanted to understand the reasons for the importance of the Christian religion in the life of the people and the history of the world. He first thought that the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was adapted to the solution of this problem. Later he was led to the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza, in whose system he searched for the roots of Hegel&#x27;s and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling&#x27;s philosophy. He moved, in 1826, to the University of Halle, attracted by Friedrich Tholuck. He conceived a plan of studying the literature of the ancient philosophers and theologians. Harless received a further impulse from his study of Blaise Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot;, but at about this time he had a crisis of conscience; he turned to the confessional writings of the Lutheran Church and found their contents in conformity with the experience of his faith. The chief attraction in the Lutheran confession was, for him, the doctrine of justification, which would become the central point of his theology.

In 1828 Harless returned from Halle to Erlangen as privat-docent in theology, and three years later became professor of New Testament exegesis. The theological faculty at Erlangen owed its later conservative tendency chiefly to Harless. In 1836 he became ordinary professor, and as such lectured also on Christian ethics, theological encyclopedia, and methodology. In 1836 he became preacher of the university. He declined calls to Rostock, Berlin, Dorpat, and Zurich. In 1840 he was appointed delegate of the chamber of states in Munich to defend the rights
of the Lutheran Church against the measures of the ministry. Harless won popularity by defending the interests of his church but the opposition party succeeded in removing him in 1845 to Baireuth, as second councilor of the consistory. In the same year, however, he was appointed professor of theology in Leipzig, where he lectured for the first time on dogmatics. Within two years he was appointed preacher at St. Nicolai, in addition to his duties as professor.

In 1850 he moved to Dresden as court preacher, reporting councillor in the ministry of public instruction, and vice-president of the state consistory, but two years later was called by King Maximilian II of Bavaria to return to his native state as president of the supreme consistory. Here Wilhelm Löhe and his adherents opposed the existing condition of the State Church, and insisted on an entire change, or, if this should be impossible, on separation. The influence of Harless, a friend of Löhe from former days, persuaded him not to separate himself from the State Church.

A new hymn-book in the spirit of orthodox Lutheranism was soon introduced. The introduction of a new order of church service was more difficult. Here the question of private confession, which was confused with auricular confession, led to opposition, but the organization of the State Church, firmly established under Harless, finally achieved a victory.

Harless now became the acknowledged leader of the whole Lutheran Church. He presided for a long time over the missionary board at Leipzig. During his latter years he was almost blind from cataracts. He died at Munich on 5 September 1879.

==Works==
His three most important works were written while professor at Erlangen, as his later public activity left him little time for literary work. They are:
* &quot;Commentar über den Brief Pauli an die Ephesier&quot; (Erlangen, 1834); 
* &quot;Theologische Encyclopädie und Methodologie vom Standpunkte der Protestantischen&quot; &quot;Kirche&quot; (Nuremberg,-1837); 
* &quot;Christliche Etik&quot; (Stuttgart, 1842; Eng. transl., Edinburgh, 1868).

The commentary and the work on ethics marked an epoch in their respective spheres. The encyclopedia is less important for its methodological arrangement than for Harless&#x27; clear and energetic views of the Church, the main points being the close relation of theology to the Church; the unity of theory and practise in a common living faith; the living continuity of the Church from her very foundation as an ideal factor of history, the emphasis of a common faith as the basis of Protestant theology; the entire transformation of this theology by the principle of justification; the necessity of preserving the principles of the Reformation in their purity; the obscurity caused by the later Protestant scholasticism, which considered the dogmas laid down in the confessional writings of the Church as the final conclusion of all dogmatic knowledge; and the sound reaction against this tendency by the Pietistic movement.

The &quot;Christliche Etik&quot; (Eng. transl., &quot;System of Christian Ethics&quot;, Edinburgh, 1868) is without doubt Harless&#x27; most important work. Its chief excellence are its scientific structure, the emphasis and consistent application of the Christian ethical principle, and the interrelation and connection of the Biblical factor with the historical factor in the more general sense of the word.

He died on 5 September 1879, having, a few years earlier, written an autobiography under the title &quot;Bruchstücke aus dem Leben eines süddeutschen Theologen&quot;.

<text>Luis Vélez de Guevara (born Luis Vélez de Santander) (1 August 1579 – 10 November 1644) was a Spanish dramatist and novelist.
He was born at Écija and was of Jewish converso descent.
After graduating as a sizar at the University of Osuna in 1596, he joined the household of Rodrigo de Castro, Cardinal-Archbishop of Seville, and celebrated the marriage of Philip III in a poem signed Vélez de Santander, a name which he continued to use until some years later.

It seems he served as a soldier in Italy and Algiers, returning to Spain in 1602 when he entered the service of the count de Saldaña, and dedicated himself to writing for the stage. He died at Madrid on 10 November 1644.

Velez de Guevara was the author of over four hundred plays, of which the best are &quot;Reinar despues de morir&quot;, &quot;La luna de la sierra&quot;, and &quot;El diablo está en Cantillana&quot;. The play &quot;Más pesa el rey que la sangre&quot;, which translates into &quot;The King weighs more than blood (kinship)&quot; is based on the episode of the Reconquista in which the nobleman Alonso Pérez de Guzmán allows his son to be sacrificed, rather than surrender his King&#x27;s possession of Tarifa. However, Vélez de Guevara is most widely known as the author of &quot;El diablo cojuelo&quot; (1641, &quot;The Lame Devil&quot; or &quot;The Crippled Devil&quot;), a fantastic novel which suggested to Alain-René Lesage the idea for &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot; (1707). The plot presents a rascal student that hides in an astrologer&#x27;s mansard. He frees a devil from a bottle. As an acknowledgement the devil shows him the apartments of Madrid and the tricks, miseries and mischiefs of their inhabitants. A similar theme was suggested by the magic lenses in &quot;Los anteojos de mejor vista&quot; (1620–1625) by Rodrigo Fernández de Ribera. Charles Dickens refers to &quot;El Diablo cojuelo&quot; in The Old Curiosity Shop, chapter thirty-three.

<doc id="1303530" wikidata="Q3629905" url="?curid=1303530" title="Hybrid seed">
<text>In agriculture and gardening, hybrid seed is produced by deliberately cross-pollinating parent plants which are genetically distinct. The parents are usually two inbred strains.

Hybrid seed is common in industrial agriculture and home gardening. It is one of the main contributors to the dramatic rise in agricultural output during the last half of the 20th century. Alternatives to hybridization include open pollination and clonal propagation.

An important factor is the heterosis that results from the genetic differences between the parents, which can produce higher yield and faster growth rate. Crossing any particular pair of inbred strains may or may not result in superior offspring. The parent strains used are carefully chosen so as to achieve the uniformity that comes from the uniformity of the parents, and the superior performance that comes from heterosis. 

Elite inbred strains are used that express well-documented and consistent phenotypes with yield that is relatively good for inbred plants. Other characteristics of the parents are carefully chosen to provide desirable traits such as improved color, flavour, or disease resistance.

Hybrid seeds planted by the farmer produce similar plants, but the seeds of the next generation from those hybrids will not consistently have the desired characteristics because of genetic assortment. It is therefore rarely desirable to save the seeds from hybrid plants to start the next crop.

== History ==

In the US, experimental agriculture stations in the 1920s investigated the hybrid crops, and by the 1930s farmers had widely adopted the first hybrid maize.

<text>Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center is a cancer research and treatment center located in Buffalo, New York. Founded by surgeon Roswell Park in 1898, the center was the first in the United States to specifically focus on cancer research. The center is usually called Roswell Park in short. The center, which conducts clinical research on cancer as well as the development new drugs, provides advanced treatment for all forms of adult and pediatric cancer, and serves as a member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center is , the only upstate New York facility to hold the National Cancer Institute designation of &quot;comprehensive cancer center&quot;.

The Roswell Park campus, spread out in 15 separate buildings of approximately two million square feet, occupies on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus (BNMC) in downtown Buffalo, and includes of space equally distributed between clinical programs and research/education functions. A separate hospital building, completed in 1998, houses a diagnostic and treatment center. The campus also includes a medical research complex as well as research and education focused spaces.

==History==
In 1898, the program that would later become the cancer center was established by Roswell Park, who was a professor of surgery at the University of Buffalo School of Medicine. Park said that &quot;Only through a deliberate well-planned, combined attack from various directions by means fitted for such work could real advances be made and further the relationship of laboratory work, clinical study and education must be closely associated.&quot;

Research started in three rooms in the University of Buffalo School of Medicine but not long thereafter, it outgrew the rooms. Seeing the importance of dedicated cancer research, select Buffalo citizens donated funds to purchase land and construct a new building. The largest contributor was Mrs. William Gratwick (wife of William H. Gratwick, the founder of Gratwick, Smith &amp; Fryer Lumber Co.), who donated $25,000. The Gratwick Research Laboratory of the University of Buffalo was constructed in 1901 and was located at High and Elm streets.

Park wrote books, gave lectures, and was the administrator at the cancer research center. In 1904, Park stepped down and Harvey R. Gaylord took over as the center&#x27;s second director. Park remained as the chairman of the board of trustees.

In coming decades the center was renamed the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, a name it retained for decades until 2018, when its current name was implemented. The Roswell Park Cancer Institute was usually called Roswell Park or RPCI for short.

=== Notable facts ===
* Founded in 1898 as the world&#x27;s first institute devoted exclusively to cancer research 1884 – On May 31, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is founded as New York Cancer Hospital at 106th Street and Central Park West in Manhattan. New York Cancer Hospital is the first institution in the United States devoted exclusively to the treatment and research of cancer.
* Gerty Cori was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
* The center&#x27;s first female leader, Candace S. Johnson was named President &amp; CEO in February 2015.
* Leads New York State in the number of robotic cystectomies performed
* Established one of the nation&#x27;s first long-term survivors clinics for childhood cancer patients

==Discoveries and advancements in cancer care==

=== Discovery of how the human body converts glucose to glycogen ===

Drs. Gerty and Carl Cori jointly won the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, &quot;for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.&quot; Their research leading to the discovery began during their tenure at Roswell Park (then called the New York State Institute for the Study of Malignant Diseases), from 1922 to 1931.

=== Alternative breast cancer treatments ===
Thomas Dao (1921–2009), served as director of the breast surgery department from 1957 to 1988, where he developed breast cancer treatment alternatives.

=== Development of photodynamic therapy ===
In 1975, Thomas Dougherty successfully treated preclinical models of cancer using photodynamic therapy (PDT) techniques for the first time. In 1978, he conducted the first PDT clinical trial. Today, PDT is an FDA-approved method for treating specific kinds of cancer, and is used around the world.

=== Discovery of PSA ===
Research resulting in the discovery of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was led by T. Ming Chu in the 1970s. His team subsequently developed a way to detect the PSA protein in blood as a simple diagnostic test. Since its FDA approvals in 1986 and 1994, an estimated one billion PSA tests have been given.

=== Research on 5-fluorouracil + leucovorin ===
Biochemist Marie Hakala, PhD first observed that 5-fluorouracil becomes more effective in treating cancer cells when calcium leucovorin is added. This discovery paved the way for the development of 5-FU + leucovorin therapy, which was for many years the gold standard of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.

=== Research on SurVaxM ===
SurVaxM, a cancer immunotherapy vaccine, was awarded orphan drug status by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2017. A phase II clinical trial of SurVaxM has shown that the vaccine, when combined with standard therapy, is more effective than standard therapies alone.

<doc id="1303547" wikidata="Q144946" url="?curid=1303547" title="Endocerida">
<text>Endocerida is an extinct nautiloid order, a group of cephalopods from the Lower Paleozoic with cone-like deposits in their siphuncle. Endocerida was a diverse group of cephalopods that lived from the Early Ordovician possibly to the Late Silurian. Their shells were variable in form. Some were straight (orthoconic), others curved (cyrtoconic); some were long (longiconic), others short (breviconic). Some long-shelled forms like &quot;Endoceras&quot; attained shell lengths close to . The related &quot;Cameroceras&quot; is anecdotally reported to have reached lengths approaching , but these claims are problematic. The overwhelming majority of endocerids and nautiloids in general are much smaller, usually less than a meter long when fully grown.

== Morphology==
Endocerids had a relatively small body chamber as well as a proportionally large siphuncle, which in some genera reached nearly half the shell diameter. This suggests that much of the visceral mass may have been housed within the siphuncle itself rather than just in the body chamber as with other nautiloids (Teichert, 1964). Endocerids are primarily distinguished by the presence of conical calcareous deposits, known as endocones, found in the more apical portion of the siphuncle. They are thought to act as a counterweight for the animal’s body. The chambers (camerae) of endocerids are always free of organic deposits, unlike orthoceratoid cephalopod orders such as the Orthocerida and Actinocerida.

===Body size===

Endocerids reached enormous body sizes. The largest confirmed specimen, belonging to &quot;Endoceras giganteum&quot;, is long as preserved, but is missing a substantial portion of its aboral end. The reconstructed length of the shell is nearly . An alleged endocerid specimen long is unconfirmed.

== Ecology==

The mode of life of endocerids is debated. Endocerids may have been the apex predators of the Ordovician, probably living close to the sea floor, and preying on trilobites, molluscs, brachiopods and other bottom-dwelling organisms. They were probably not active nektonic swimmers, but rather crawled over the floor of epicontinental seas or lay there in ambush. Although there is study that supports filter feeding ecology, according to hydrostatic properties, it is not likely and still supports benthic predators.

===Reproduction===

Endocerids laid relatively large eggs, and hatched at a relatively large body size. It is likely that endocerids were demersal after hatching, as large eggs would make an easy target for predators in the pelagic zone. Endocerids may have migrated from their habitat in the open ocean to shallower water to lay their eggs.

==Diversity==
Endocerids were among some half a dozen cephalopod orders that appeared in the Lower Ordovician. They reached their greatest diversity during the Lower to Mid-Ordovician, but were already in decline by the middle of this period with most genera becoming extinct by the end of the Sandbian (late Ordovician), while some rare hangers on lasted into the Silurian. In any case, the endocerid lineage became completely extinct relatively early on in cephalopod history.

==Classification==

=== Evolution ===
Endocerids evolved from the earlier ellesmerocerids, most likely from a genus similar to &quot;Pachendoceras&quot;. This ellesmerocerid gave rise to &quot;Proendoceras&quot;, the earliest representative of the Proterocameroceratidae and hence of the Endocerida. Endocerids evolved from ellesmerocerids by reduction of siphuncle diaphragms and the development of endocones. In the early part of the mid-Lower Ordovician, the Endocerida quickly diversified into many different families. In true endocerids, there was a trend of overall increasing size, eventually resulting in massive orthoconic genera such as &quot;Endoceras&quot; and &quot;Cameroceras&quot;. In another lineage (now known as Bisonocerida), the siphuncle grew more complex, resulting in genera such as &quot;Chihlioceras&quot; and &quot;Allotrioceras&quot;.

=== Taxonomy ===
Citing its diversity, Curt Teichert (1964) placed the Endocerida in its own subclass called the Endoceroidea or Endoceratoidea (which some Russian paleontologists ranked as a superorder instead. Rousseau Flower rejected this separation on the grounds that endocerids were no more diverse or complex than any other order. He considered them to be simply another order within the Nautiloidea.

Flower (1958) divided the Endocerida into two suborders, the Proterocamerocerina and the Endocerina. As he defined the two suborders, Proterocamerocerina included the Proterocameroceratidae, Manchuroceratidae, and Emmonsoceratidae, while Endocerina included the Piloceratidae and Endoceratidae. Endocerid classification since then has relied on a dichotomy between short-shelled forms with complex endocones and long-shelled forms with simple endocones.

Endocerid relationships have been difficult to establish both within the order and relative to other nautiloids. Their generally orthoconic shell shape and dorsomyarian muscle scars are similar to the subclass Orthoceratoidea, which are ancestral to ammonoids (ammonites) and coleoids (squid, octopus, etc.). However, their nautilosiphonate connecting ring structure and lack of cameral deposits are more similar to living nautilus and their proposed ancestors, the subclass Multiceratoidea. Some studies have re-established Endoceratoidea to clarify that endocerids occupy a unique subclass of nautiloids.

Restudy of piloceratid-like families with complex endocones has suggested that Endocerida in its broadest form is polyphyletic, with piloceratid-like and proterocameroceratid-like members having independent origins from ellesmerocerids. In light of this issue, the numerous piloceratid-like families were placed within a new order, Bisonocerida. Bisonocerida may still be related to endocerids within Endoceratoidea.

<doc id="1303565" wikidata="Q6848802" url="?curid=1303565" title="Mike Sherman">
<text>Michael Francis Sherman (born December 19, 1954) is an American gridiron football coach and former player who most recently was the head coach of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was the head coach of the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) from 2000 to 2005. Sherman led the Packers to five consecutive winning seasons from 2000 to 2004 and three divisional titles in 2002, 2003, and 2004, but never advanced past the divisional round of the playoffs. He was also the head football coach at Texas A&amp;M University from 2008 to 2011. He has also been a coach in the NFL for the Seattle Seahawks, Houston Texans and Miami Dolphins. Before he started coaching in the NFL, he served as an assistant coach at five different colleges, including Texas A&amp;M, where he coached the offensive line for seven seasons. He is one of only a few coaches that has been a head coach at the high school, college, CFL and NFL level.

==Early life and family==
Sherman was born in 1954 in Norwood, Massachusetts. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, Sherman spent his life in Hyde Park, Massachusetts, the southernmost neighborhood in Boston. He lived there with his parents, Claire and Frank Sherman, his two sisters, and his two brothers. His extended family members, who lived nearby, were devout Green Bay Packers fans and have dutifully followed Sherman&#x27;s career. Sherman was also raised in Northborough, Massachusetts, where he attended Algonquin Regional High School, playing for the football team.

Sherman earned a scholarship to play at Central Connecticut State University, where he played defensive end and offensive tackle. He majored in English. Though he was considered to be an average player with limited abilities in college, he was noted for his strong commitment. Right after college, Sherman became an English teacher and an assistant football coach, serving at Stamford High School in Connecticut in 1978 and at Worcester Academy in Massachusetts from 1979 to 1980.

Sherman&#x27;s father worked for a pipe company in New England and retired in 1991. Both his parents lived on Cape Cod. Sherman has been married to his wife Karen since 1982, and the couple have five children together (Sarah, Emily, Matthew, Benjamin and Selena). Sherman is the father-in-law of Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor, who is married to his oldest daughter. 

Sherman and his family reside on Cape Cod. A former reading and special education teacher, Karen is a very active member of the West Dennis Library Board of Trustees.

==Coaching career==

===Early career===
Sherman started his college coaching career as a graduate assistant at the University of Pittsburgh, where he was part of Jackie Sherrill&#x27;s staff from 1981 to 1982. While at Pittsburgh, Sherman wasn&#x27;t able to afford an apartment; instead, he slept on a cot in Pitt Stadium. After his stay at Pittsburgh, Sherman then coached the offensive line at Tulane from 1983 to 1984, and later moved to Holy Cross, where he coached the offensive line from 1985 to 1987 before becoming the offensive coordinator for the 1988 season.

From 1989 to 1993, Sherman coached the Texas A&amp;M offensive line. During the 1992–93 season, he met retired head coach Gary Kubiak, who had coached the A&amp;M running backs. In 1994, Sherman left Texas A&amp;M to coach the UCLA offensive line, which included former Baltimore Ravens pro bowler Jonathan Ogden. Sherman later returned to Texas A&amp;M to coach the offensive line again for the 1995–96 seasons. Under Sherman, the Aggie offense averaged over 400 yards of total offense four times in his seven seasons at A&amp;M. The 1990 Aggie team set a school record of 471.1 yards per game. Sherman also helped the Aggies to win three Southwest Conference championships consecutively from 1991 to 1993. Additionally, he recruited Leeland McElroy, who would become one of the Aggies&#x27; top 10 all-time leading running backs.

On December 20, 1996, A&amp;M head coach R. C. Slocum promoted Sherman to offensive coordinator to replace dismissed Steve Ensminger. Months later, Sherman resigned to start his professional coaching career as the assistant offensive line and tight ends coach for the Green Bay Packers. When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: &quot;There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A&amp;M for and only one professional job that I&#x27;ve ever had any interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the small-town atmosphere of College Station for my family, and Green Bay offers that same atmosphere. If the truth be told, there is not a whole lot of difference between an `Aggie&#x27; and a `Cheesehead.&quot; He served the position for the 1997–98 seasons. After Packers head coach Mike Holmgren resigned to accept the Seattle Seahawks head coach position, Holmgren hired Sherman to become the offensive coordinator for the 1999 season.

===Green Bay Packers===

In 2000, Sherman became the head coach of the Green Bay Packers. He led the Packers to five consecutive winning seasons from 2000 to 2004. From 2002 to 2004, he led the Packers to three consecutive NFC North Division titles. From 2000 to 2004, he compiled a 53–27 record, and a .663 winning percentage, which was the second highest in Packers history, trailing that of Vince Lombardi&#x27;s, who is one of the most successful coaches in the history of football. Additionally, Green Bay and the Philadelphia Eagles were the only two teams to make the playoffs for four consecutive seasons from 2001 to 2004.

An offensive-minded coach, Sherman led the Packers to break franchise records for rushing in 2003 and passing in 2004. In 2003, Packers quarterback Brett Favre led the NFL in touchdown passes, in addition to setting a franchise record for rushing yardage. The 2003 team also gained a total of 442 points, which is the fourth most in franchise history (560 in 2011, 461 in 2009, 456 in 1996, when the team won the Super Bowl).

Despite receiving a contract extension earlier in the 2005 season, Sherman was fired by the Packers on January 2, 2006, after compiling a 4–12 record — Green Bay&#x27;s first losing record since the 1991 season (it was also Sherman&#x27;s only losing season during his Packers tenure). The Packers had lost pro bowlers Javon Walker, Bubba Franks and Ahman Green to injured reserve early in the season.

In his six-year head coaching career with the Packers from 2000 to 2005, Sherman compiled a 57–39 regular season record and a 2–4 postseason record. Sherman used the West Coast offense at Green Bay.

====General manager====
Sherman succeeded Ron Wolf as general manager (GM) of the Packers in 2001, taking on the dual role of head coach and general manager. Although the promotion of Sherman to GM was made prior to the 2001 NFL draft, Wolf handled the draft duty in 2001. Sherman brought in three of the core players that were on the Packers 2010 roster. He drafted Nick Barnett, Scott Wells, and acquired Cullen Jenkins as a rookie free agent after the 2003 draft.

Sherman&#x27;s first solo draft pick as GM and in charge of the draft was Javon Walker in 2002, who made the Pro Bowl in 2004, and was traded to the Denver Broncos in 2006.

In 2005 the Packers hired Ted Thompson from the Seattle Seahawks to take over Sherman&#x27;s general manager duties, although Sherman remained the Packers&#x27; head coach for one more season.

===Houston Texans===
The Houston Texans hired Sherman as the assistant head coach/offense coach on February 15, 2006. On January 17, 2007, he was promoted to offensive coordinator following the departure of Troy Calhoun, who left the Texans to take the head coaching job at Air Force, and Sherman retained his role as assistant head coach. In the 2006 season, the Texans&#x27; regular season offense ranked 28th out of 32 NFL teams. In the 2007 season, Sherman&#x27;s first year as the offensive coordinator, the Texans&#x27; regular season offense improved to a ranking of 14.

The Texans finished the 2006 season with a 6–10 record. In 2007, they finished with an 8–8 record.

===Texas A&amp;M Aggies===

Sherman became the head coach of the Texas A&amp;M football team in November 2007. He signed a seven-year contract that at the time paid him $1.8 million annually. Sherman abandoned the zone read option offense run by former A&amp;M coach Dennis Franchione, and installed a pro-style offense similar to those used in the NFL. He uses a balanced offense run primarily out of pro-style formations.

After two straight losing seasons, the Aggies started the 2010 season 3–3 but won their final six games to finish 9–3 and earn a share of the Big 12 South Division title. After the 2010 season, he signed a contract extension through the 2015 season. His salary was raised to $2.2 million.

In 2011, the Aggies began as a top 10 ranked team, but fell out of the polls after losing four games, three of which had double-digit half-time leads. Three of those four losses were to teams later ranked among the top ten in the nation. On November 19, 2011, the Aggies defeated Kansas by a score of 61–7 and became bowl-eligible for a third straight season. Five days later, on November 24, 2011, they would lose at home to the University of Texas 27–25 on a last-second field goal, in what would likely be the last game of the rivalry. It was the Aggies&#x27; sixth loss of the season, and the fifth in which they held a second-half lead of two or more scores.

===Miami Dolphins===
The Dolphins hired Sherman as offensive coordinator on January 27, 2012.

On April 27, 2012, the Dolphins drafted Ryan Tannehill with the 8th overall pick. Sherman coached Tannehill at Texas A&amp;M and was instrumental in the decision-making leading to the Dolphins selecting Tannehill.

===Nauset Regional High School===
In May 2015, Nauset Regional High School announced Sherman would take over as head football coach following the resignation of coach Keith Kenyon, who became the new assistant principal. After compiling a 4–18 record over two seasons, Sherman resigned in May 2017.

===Your Call Football===
In November 2017, it was announced that Sherman had joined Your Call Football, a new platform in which fans call plays in real-time in real, live games. Prior to the season, Sherman was hired by the CFL&#x27;s Montreal Alouettes. He would still serve as the head coach during Your Call Football&#x27;s inaugural season.

===Montreal Alouettes===
On December 20, 2017, Sherman was hired by the Montreal Alouettes as head coach. During the 2018 CFL season, Sherman, along with June Jones and Marc Trestman had the distinction of having both CFL and NFL head coaching experience to coach in the same season. He finished with a 5–13 record in his first full season with the Alouettes.

On June 8, 2019, shortly before the start of the regular season and a week after the Alouettes ownership surrendered the franchise back to the CFL, the Alouettes released an ambiguously worded statement claiming that they and Sherman had &quot;agreed to part ways.&quot;

<text>Gil Courtemanche (August 18, 1943 – August 19, 2011) was a Canadian progressive journalist and novelist in third-world and international politics. He wrote for the Montreal newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot;.

==Life and career==
Courtemanche was born in Montreal, Quebec. He began his career as a journalist in 1962, with several collaborations with Radio-Canada including &quot;Le 60&quot;, &quot;Métro Magazine&quot; and &quot;Présent National&quot;. He later created &quot;L&#x27;Évènement&quot;, a television program with Radio-Canada which he also hosted between 1978 and 1980. During the same period, he was also an editorialist with CBOT, an Ottawa radio station. In 1978, he hosted &quot;Contact&quot;, the first public affairs magazine for Télé-Québec. Between 1980 and 1986, he worked as a host, analyst and correspondent for the programs &quot;Télémag&quot;, &quot;Première Page&quot; and &quot;Le Point&quot; with Radio-Canada.

Courtemanche helped found the sovereigntist and social democrat newspaper &quot;Le Jour&quot;, and also worked as a journalist with &quot;La Presse&quot;. From 1986, he worked on various publications such as Alternatives and Le Libraire. He published columns on international politics in &quot;Le Soleil&quot;, &quot;Le Droit&quot;, and &quot;Le Devoir&quot;.

He participated in making documentaries, including the series &quot;Soleil dans la nuit&quot; for TV5 Europe-Afrique-Canada, on the first anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. He also filmed a documentary on AIDS entitled &quot;The Gospel of AIDS&quot;. Furthermore, he helped produced various documentaries and advertisements on the third-world for &quot;Le Cardinal Léger et ses œuvres&quot; and &quot;OXFAM-Québec&quot;: leprosy in Haiti, the politics of water, agricultural development in the Philippines, education for disabled children in Thailand, etc.

His first novel, &quot;Un dimanche à la piscine à Kigali&quot;, which documents the Rwandan genocide of 1994, was published in 2000. It was chosen for inclusion in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004, where it was defended by writer, environmentalist and activist Laure Waridel. &quot;Un dimanche à la piscine à Kigali&quot; eventually won the contest. It was filmed as &quot;A Sunday in Kigali (Un dimanche à Kigali)&quot;.

==Death==
Courtemanche died August 19, 2011, from cancer, one day after his 68th birthday.

<text>A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali (original French title: &quot;Un dimanche à la piscine à Kigali&quot;) is the first novel by Montreal author Gil Courtemanche, originally published in 2000.

Set in Kigali, Rwanda, the novel deals with a love affair between an elder Canadian expatriate and a young Rwandan, AIDS and the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

==Plot==
Bernard Valcourt, a documentary filmmaker from Quebec, has been sent to the Rwandan capital Kigali to set up a television station. He falls in love with a Rwandan girl, Gentille, who in reality is an ethnic Hutu, but she is often mistaken for a Tutsi. With the Hutu government encouraging violence against Tutsis, Gentille&#x27;s life becomes endangered. Encouraged by his love for Gentille, and a desire to complete a documentary to bring the tragedy of AIDS to the attention of the outside world, Valcourt refuses to leave Rwanda. When the two are married, they become separated, leaving Valcourt believing that Gentille has been killed. He then determines to document her life story, and sets out to discover the story of her final days.

==Recognition==
The novel was translated into English as &quot;A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali&quot; by Patricia Claxton in 2003 (). It was nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for French to English translation.

&quot;Un dimanche à la piscine à Kigali&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, &quot;Le combat des livres&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004, where it was defended by writer, environmentalist and activist Laure Waridel. &quot;Un dimanche à la piscine à Kigali&quot; eventually won the contest.

A nomination for the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize 2004 was awarded to the book by Rogers Communications and the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada.

==Movie==
In 2006, a movie inspired by the book, &quot;A Sunday in Kigali&quot; (French &quot;Un dimanche à Kigali&quot;), was released.

<text>Julius H. Grey (born August 4, 1948) is a Canadian lawyer and university professor. He is particularly known for his expertise in constitutional and human rights law. He is a senior partner at the law firm Grey Casgrain, s.e.n.c.

Born in Wrocław, Poland, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1971, a Bachelor of Civil Law degree in 1971, and a Master of Arts degree in 1973 from McGill University. Grey has been a member of the Quebec Bar and the Canadian Bar Association since 1974. Since 1976 he has been involved in numerous associations such as the Canadian Foundation for Individual Rights, serving as its president from 1985 to 1988. He was a professor of law at McGill University from 1977 until 2002. Mr. Grey was awarded the Médaille du Barreau du Québec, which is the highest distinction a member can receive.

In 1982, Grey defended two Montreal writers, Henry Srebrnik and Shloime Perel, who had published an article, &quot;Signs of the Times,&quot; in the January 22 issue of the Jerusalem Post, which summarized the anxiety then being experienced by the Montreal Jewish community following the election in November 1976 of the Parti Québécois. On February 17, the newspaper Le Devoir attacked the Post article, under the sensationalist headline &quot;La diaspora de Montréal est menacée par l’anti-sémitisme.&quot; A day later an editorial, &quot;Le Québec discrédité en Israël,&quot; appeared in the paper. Grey filed a suit in Quebec Superior Court, charging that the authors had been the victims of a hate campaign. Le Devoir finally settled out of court and printed an apology on its op-ed page on December 17, 1985.

Grey assisted in annulling a stipulation in the Charte de la langue française (Bill 101) that forbade the application of different languages on business signboards. Presently, French must merely be the predominant language, but others are allowed.

Grey supported &quot;La servante écarlate&quot; by Margaret Atwood, the French version of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004.

Grey defended the periodical &quot;La Presse Chinoise&quot; against a defamation lawsuit filed by Falun Gong. In 2005, the Superior Court of Quebec ruled that the articles published by the newspaper did not qualify as defamation. However, a subsequent ruling by the Quebec Court of Appeal in June 2008 reversed the lower court&#x27;s ruling.

Grey has publicly supported the New Democratic Party and Québec Solidaire, despite being a federalist. He was rumoured to be a future star candidate for the party in Montreal, following that party&#x27;s successful capture of Outremont in a by-election by Thomas Mulcair on September 17, 2007; however, he did not run in the 2008 or 2011 general elections. Although he considered running in the next Canadian federal election, he did not.

Grey is married to Lynne Casgrain, ombudsman of the McGill University Health Centre and daughter of former Québec cabinet minister Claire Kirkland-Casgrain.

<text>Measha Brueggergosman–Lee (née Gosman; June 28, 1977) is a Canadian soprano who performs both as an opera singer and concert artist. She has performed internationally and won numerous awards. Her recordings of both classical and popular music have also received awards.

==Background==

She was born Measha Gosman in Fredericton, New Brunswick, to Anne Eatmon and Sterling Gosman. As a child, Gosman began singing in the choir of her local Baptist church, where her father served as a deacon. She studied voice and piano from the age of seven. As a teen, she took voice lessons in her home town, and spent summers on scholarships at the Boston Conservatory and at a choral camp in Rothesay, New Brunswick. She studied for one year with New Brunswick soprano Wendy Nielsen, before moving on to studies at the University of Toronto, where she obtained a B.Mus. She went to Germany for five years, where she pursued a Master&#x27;s degree at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in Düsseldorf, Germany.

In 2007, Brueggergosman discovered her family&#x27;s deep history in Canada and the United States. Her paternal 4x great-grandparents were John Gosman and his wife Rose, African Americans who each escaped from slavery in New England colonies during the American Revolution by going to British lines. John was from Connecticut and Rose from Rhode Island. They probably met in New York City, then occupied by the British. The British gave freedom to American slaves who left rebel slaveholders and sought refuge with them. Tens of thousands of slaves, mostly in the South, took advantage of the war&#x27;s chaos to escape.

After the war, the British arranged transport to Nova Scotia for nearly 3500 Black Loyalists from the former Thirteen Colonies. John and Rose Gosman and their five-month-old daughter Fanny, born free in British lines, were recorded in the British embarkation record known as the &quot;Book of Negroes&quot;. They had a passage in 1783 on one of the last ships to leave New York for Nova Scotia. Measha&#x27;s great-grandparents first lived in Shelburne, but later settled in Fredericton. Brueggergosman learned of her African-American roots on &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;, a British-based program bought by the CBC. According to Y-DNA genetic testing of her brother, it is likely their direct-line paternal African ancestors came from the Bassa people of Cameroon.

==Career==
At age 20, Brueggergosman played the lead in the premiere of the opera &quot;Beatrice Chancy&quot; by James Rolfe and George Elliott Clarke. Produced in Toronto in 1998, and in Nova Scotia the following year, the opera tells the story of a slave girl in 19th–century rural Nova Scotia who murders her abusive father, the man who is also her master. The opera and Brueggergosman were well received by critics and audiences. In 2000 it was filmed for the CBC.

Brueggergosman has appeared throughout Canada, where she has performed with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Thunder Bay Symphony Orchestra and Music Director Geoffrey Moull, National Arts Centre Orchestra under the direction of Pinchas Zukerman, and at Roy Thomson Hall.

She has performed internationally, as well, in the United States, Germany and other nations. She was in &quot;Elektra&quot;, &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, and &quot;Turandot&quot; with the Cincinnati Opera. She has also performed the Verdi &quot;Requiem&quot; with Sir Andrew Davis and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, as well as with Helmuth Rilling at the International Beethoven Festival in Bonn.

In 2002, she was the soprano soloist in the Canadian premiere of Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Credo&quot;, under the direction of its composer, and in the attendance of the then Governor General of Canada, Adrienne Clarkson.

In 2005, Brueggergosman was a soloist in recording William Bolcom&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience&quot;, which won three Grammy awards, including Best Classical Album.

In July 2007 she was a new performer at the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, singing in the &#x27;Phantom of the Opera&#x27; medley and closing the show with &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

She has also performed in the United States, for instance in the fall of 2009 with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, in their performance of Michael Tippett&#x27;s oratorio &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;.

She performed role of Jenny in Weill/Brecht Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny in 2010 in Madrid&#x27;s Teatro Real.

She performed the Olympic Hymn at the Opening Ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Games. During NBC&#x27;s broadcast of the opening ceremony, Bob Costas remarked to Matt Lauer, co-host of &quot;Today&quot;, as the two hosted it about Brueggergosman&#x27;s performance of the Olympic Hymn: &quot;That&#x27;s a hymn for you, right there,&quot; and laughed. She performed an arrangement of the English sung version of the hymn in English and French to reflect Canada&#x27;s official languages.

In 2012 Brueggergosman was a judge on the Canadian reality show &quot;Canada&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. The show was subsequently cancelled after one season but was revived in 2022.

She has also had acting roles in the &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; episode &quot;Murdoch at the Opera&quot;, and in the films &quot;Brown Girl Begins&quot; and &quot;The Young Arsonists&quot;.

In 2021 she created the symphonic short film &quot;Forgotten Coast&quot;, an exploration of Black Canadian history in Nova Scotia, for the National Arts Centre/CBC Gem series &quot;Undisrupted&quot;.

==Charitable activities==
Brueggergosman is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

In 2007, Brueggergosman became the Goodwill Ambassador for the African Medical &amp; Research Foundation (AMREF), a charity working for Better Health in Africa. In June of that year she travelled to the war-affected village of Patongo in East Africa to share her voice as a form of musical therapy for children. Brueggergosman described herself after the trip as &quot;never the same&quot; and continues her work with AMREF today.

==Personal life==
She married Markus Brügger, born in Germany. They first met in high school, when he was an exchange student in New Brunswick. When they married, they combined their last names to Brüggergosman (also spelled Brueggergosman). They have two sons. They divorced in 2018. In 2021 she married jazz guitarist Steve Lee.

Suffering a heart condition in June 2009, Brueggergosman took some time off to recover from open heart surgery. She returned to the stage in September 2009 for a performance at the Toronto International Film Festival.

On June 20, 2019, Brueggergosman underwent another successful open heart surgery (double bypass) in Calgary.

==Awards and recognition==
She was awarded the Grand Prize at the 2009 &quot;Jeunesses Musicales&quot; Montreal International Musical Competition and won First Prize at the International Vocal Competition &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in 2002. Brueggergosman has been a prizewinner at other competitions, including the Wigmore Hall International Song Competition in London, the George London Foundation in New Deli, the Queen Sonja International Music Competition in Oslo, and the ARD International Music Competition in Munich.

The recipient of the prestigious Canada Council and Chalmers Performing Arts grants, Brueggergosman has been twice nominated for Juno Awards. She won the 2008 Juno Award for Classical Album of the Year: Vocal or Choral Performance for &quot;Surprise&quot;, recorded with Deutsche Grammophon, with whom she has an exclusive contract.

In 2015, she appeared in the documentary television series &quot;Songs of Freedom&quot;, which profiled her exploring and learning about her African heritage leading up to a live concert performance of African-American spiritual music.

Brueggergosman has also appeared as a &quot;judge&quot; on MuchMusic&#x27;s &quot;Video on Trial&quot; and on Slice TV&#x27;s &quot;Project Runway Canada&quot;.

In 2017, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Concordia University.

<text>The post–World War I recession was an economic recession that hit much of the world in the aftermath of World War I. In many nations, especially in North America, economic growth continued and even accelerated during World War I as nations mobilized their economies to fight the war in Europe. After the war ended, the global economy began to decline. In the United States, 1918–1919 saw a modest economic retreat, but the second part of 1919 saw a mild recovery. A more severe recession hit the United States in 1920 and 1921, when the global economy fell very sharply.

== North America ==
In North America, the recession immediately following World War I was extremely brief, lasting for only seven months from August 1918 (even before the war had actually ended) to March 1919. A second, much more severe recession, sometimes labeled a depression, began in January 1920. Several indices of economic activity suggest the recession was moderately severe. The Axe-Houghton Index of Trade and Industrial Activity declined by 14.1% in this recession (compared to a 31% decline in the Panic of 1907). The Babson index of physical volume of business activity declined by 28.6% in the immediate postwar recession (compared to a 32.3% decline in the 1921 recession and a 22.7% decline in the Panic of 1907).

== Germany ==
In Germany, the economic recession and inflation was harder due to the imposition of the Treaty of Versailles. A period of hyperinflation severely devalued the Mark and nearly crippled the German economy.

==United Kingdom==
Britain initially enjoyed an economic boom between 1919–1920, as private capital pent-up over 5 years of war was invested into the economy. The shipbuilding industry was flooded with orders to replace lost shipping (7.9 million tons worth of merchant shipping stock was destroyed during the war). However, by 1921, the British transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy faltered, and a serious recession struck the economy between 1921–1922. With other major economies also mired in recession, the export-dependent economy of Britain was particularly hard-hit. Unemployment reached 17%, with overall exports at only half of their pre-war levels.

== Global pandemic of 1918 ==
The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic had an adverse economic impact. Many businesses were shuttered during the worst of the outbreak and the sheer numbers killed reduced the workforce population significantly. Work by economists Robert Barro and Jose Ursua suggests that the flu was responsible for declines in gross domestic product of 6 to 8 percent worldwide between 1919 and 1921.

==History==
The &quot;župa&quot; of Gradačac was first mentioned in 1302, while the town&#x27;s first written mention dates from 1465 (also as &quot;Gračac&quot;). The town became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1512, its &quot;nahija&quot; (municipality) was first recorded in the defter of 1533, while its &quot;kadiluk&quot; (county) was recorded in 1634.

In 1701, the settlement was given the status of a &quot;palanka&quot; (city), and it became the headquarters of a military captaincy in 1710. The captains of the Gradaščević family led the development of the city, and the most famous of them, Husein-kapetan Gradaščević or &quot;Zmaj od Bosne&quot; (&quot;Dragon of Bosnia&quot;), led an uprising that raised to arms most of the Bosnian captains in 1831.

The town has a fort with 18-meter high walls built between 1765 and 1821, and a 22-meter high watchtower built in 1824 by Husein-kapetan Gradaščević on foundations made originally by the Romans. Husejnija Mosque was built in 1826.

From 1929 to 1939, Gradačac was part of the Vrbas Banovina and from 1939 to 1941 of the Banovina of Croatia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

It was severely bombed during the Bosnian War 1992–1995. It is located at the narrow northern corridor that connects two major portions of the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska, near Brčko. Gradačac became part of the Tuzla Canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the war.

==Thermal springs==
The first spa facility, Ilidža Spa Treatment Centre was built on the thermal springs in Gradačac in 1882. The water temperature is 29.30˚C found at depth of 286 meters. In the area nearby are also two lakes Hazna and Vidara. Both lakes were built as part of project for protecting city from floods who took final stroke in 1964 and 1967, when the city&#x27;s industrial part was underwater due to extensive floods.

==Economy==
The most important industries in Gradačac are textile, chemical, mechanical and food processing. Gradačac is the place where the traditional international fair for plums &quot;Sajam šljive&quot; (also known as &quot;Šljivarevo&quot;) is held. In August 2015, the traditional international plum fair &quot;Sajam šljive&quot; was held. It was attended by 250 presenters from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Germany, Turkey and Hungary. One of the more notable local firms is &quot;Kula&quot;, who was founded in 1960 as a small local factory producing clothing. Today, Kula is modern and respective company in Eastern Europe with 700 employees and annual production of 300.000 pieces. Kula visits fashion fairs in country and Europe. Kula&#x27;s models were seen in fashion fairs in Brussel, Leipzig, Düsseldorf and Brno.

<text>Nicholas John Arthur Holmes (born 7 January 1971) is an English singer, best known as the lead vocalist of the gothic metal/doom metal band Paradise Lost and Swedish death metal band Bloodbath.

==Biography==
Holmes formed Paradise Lost in late 1988 when he and the other band members were barely out of secondary school.

Like other contemporaries of the British death-doom scene (Anathema and My Dying Bride), the band began purely as death metal, with Holmes using a low, guttural death grunt on their early demos and &quot;Lost Paradise&quot; (1990), &quot;Gothic&quot; (1991), and &quot;Shades of God&quot; (1992) full-lengths (though the latter two albums were not exclusively death metal in execution, and Holmes even utilized some clean vocals as well). Beginning with 1993&#x27;s &quot;Icon&quot;, the death grunts were discarded entirely in favour of a raw but decipherable James Hetfield-like bellow. When the band yet again transitioned stylistically with 1997&#x27;s &quot;One Second&quot;, Holmes&#x27; vocals took on a more gothic rock croon, which remained his prevalent style for the next several albums that followed. However, with 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Plague Within&quot;, the band reincorporated low growls in some songs, a style which continued with 2017&#x27;s &quot;Medusa&quot; and 2020&#x27;s &quot;Obsidian&quot;.

In September 2014, it was officially announced that Holmes had replaced Mikael Åkerfeldt as the vocalist in the Swedish death metal band Bloodbath, taking the moniker Old Nick. He has thus far released three albums with the band, &quot;Grand Morbid Funeral&quot; (2014), &quot;The Arrow of Satan Is Drawn&quot; (2018) and &quot;Survival of the Sickest&quot; (2022).

<doc id="1303632" wikidata="Q288727" url="?curid=1303632" title="Sapporo Breweries">
<text>is a Japanese beer brewing company founded in 1876. Sapporo is the oldest brand of beer in Japan. It was first brewed in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, in 1876 by brewer Seibei Nakagawa. The world headquarters of Sapporo Breweries is in Ebisu, Shibuya, Tokyo. The company purchased the Canadian company Sleeman Breweries in 2006.

The company has five breweries in Japan, the Sleeman brewery in Guelph, Ontario, Canada and Sapporo Brewing Company in La Crosse, Wisconsin, U.S. The main brands are &quot;Sapporo Draft&quot;; &quot;Yebisu&quot;; and &quot;Sleeman Cream Ale&quot;. Sapporo Premium has been the No. 1 selling Asian beer in the United States since Sapporo U.S.A., Inc. was first founded in 1984.

In 2003, Sapporo Breweries restructured into a holding company known as with the brewery division being taken over by the second incarnation of Sapporo Breweries.

Sapporo Breweries is a member of the Mitsui &quot;keiretsu&quot;.

==History==
The origins of this company are in Sapporo, Hokkaido during the Meiji period, where the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitakushi) established many businesses. Seibei Nakagawa, a Germany-trained brewer, became the first brewmaster of the Kaitakushi Brewery in June 1876, and the first Sapporo Lager was produced at that time following the completion of the plant in September of that year. Privatized in 1886, the Sapporo brewery became the centerpiece for the Sapporo Beer Company.

In 1887, another company, the Nippon Beer Brewery Company, was established in Mita, Meguro, Tokyo, and began producing Yebisu Beer. The competition between Sapporo and Nippon Beer, as well as competition with the Osaka (now Asahi) and Kirin breweries led to a 1906 merger of Sapporo, Nippon, and Osaka breweries into the Dai-Nippon Beer Company, Ltd. (), which formed a near monopoly on the Japanese market until after World War II.

After 1949, Dai-Nippon was split into Nippon and Asahi breweries, with the Nippon Breweries resuming production of Sapporo beer in 1956 and renaming itself to the present name, Sapporo Breweries, in 1964. Yebisu Beer was relaunched as a separate brand in 1971, marketed as a German-style barley beer. Sapporo Black Label beer was launched in 1977.

In 2006, Sapporo announced that it would be acquiring Canadian brewer Sleeman in a $400-million all-cash deal.

On February 15, 2007, Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund, a Cayman Islands-registered fund management subsidiary of Warren Lichtenstein&#x27;s Steel Partners and the biggest shareholder (18.6% as of Feb. 2007) of Sapporo Holdings, submitted a proposal to the company seeking approval to raise its stake to 66.6%.

On 3 August 2017, it was announced that Sapporo Brewing Company would be acquiring Anchor Brewing.

In 2020, Sapporo Breweries won the Lausanne Index Prize - Best of Packaging.

Despite its name, &quot;Sapporo beer&quot; is not exclusively brewed in Sapporo. Sapporo is also brewed in Sendai, Chiba, Shizuoka, and Kyushu. Most Sapporo beer sold in North America had been brewed at the Sleeman brewery in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Sapporo completed a $165 million dollar buyout of Stone Brewing Co. in September 2022, acquiring Stone&#x27;s brewing facilities in Escondido, California and Richmond, Virginia. The Richmond, VA facility is currently undergoing $33 million in capital upgrades, after which it will make about 50% of their total United States output.

==Breweries==
===Japan===
Sapporo has five breweries in Japan. The first, Sendai Brewery, was opened in 1971 in Natori, Miyagi, and was among the first to use a computerised brewing system. Shizuoka Brewery in Yaizu was opened in 1980, Chiba Brewery in Chiba was opened in 1988, Hokkaido Brewery in Eniwa, Hokkaido was built in 1989, and the Kyushu Hita Brewery was opened in Hita, Ōita in 2000.

===Canada===
Sleeman Breweries was purchased by Sapporo Brewery in 2006 for $400 million. Sleeman was restarted in 1988 in Guelph, Ontario, Canada by the great grandson of John H. Sleeman, the owner of the original Sleeman brewery founded in 1834. The first Sleeman brewery ceased operations by 1933, when their liquor license was revoked for bootlegging, specifically, smuggling beer into Detroit, Michigan. The company&#x27;s current products are based on the family&#x27;s original recipes, and recipes from Unibroue (which brewery Sleeman had previously purchased). Sleeman Breweries / Sapporo Canada currently consists of four Canadian breweries: Sleeman in Guelph, Ontario, Okanagan Spring in Vernon, British Columbia, Unibroue in Chambly, Quebec, and Wild Rose Brewery in Calgary, Alberta. As of 2017, Sleeman Breweries also owned 4.2% of The Beer Store.

=== United States ===
Sapporo beers are brewed, canned, and bottled for Sapporo Brewing Company by City Brewing Company in La Crosse, Wisconsin, for Sapporo U.S.A.

On 3 August 2017, it was announced that Sapporo Breweries would acquire the Anchor Brewing Company. In June 2022, Stone and Sapporo announced that they had reached an agreement for Sapporo to purchase Stone Brewing for $168 million, with the purchase expected to close in August 2022. The acquisition has since closed. In July 2023, it was announced that Anchor would shut down and liquidate assets.

===Vietnam===
The Sapporo Vietnam brewery is situated in Đức Hòa, Long An. Its products include 650ml cans of premium beer for the Australian and Mexican market.
Sapporo Beer sold in 650ml cans in California are brewed in Vietnam.

==Brands==

The company produces a range of pale and dark lagers, including &quot;Sapporo Draft&quot; (&quot;Premium&quot; in North America) and &quot;Yebisu&quot;. In the Sleeman brewery in Canada they brew Sleeman branded beers such as &quot;Sleeman Cream Ale&quot;, as well as &quot;Sapporo Premium&quot;.

The company also produces a malt based soft drink, &quot;Super Clear&quot;, which was launched in 2002 as a low-alcohol beer, then changed in September 2009 to an alcohol free malt drink.

===Yebisu===
 is one of Japan&#x27;s oldest brands, first brewed in Tokyo in 1890 by the Japan Beer Brewery Company. Through a complicated set of mergers and divisions, the brand was acquired and eventually retained by the modern-day Sapporo Brewery. The brand lay dormant during the post-World War II era, until it was resurrected in 1971. It has been brewed continuously ever since.

&quot;Yebisu&quot; comes in two main varieties: &quot;Yebisu (Premium)&quot;, a Dortmunder/export lager, and &quot;Yebisu Black&quot;, a dark lager. There are also occasional special varieties that are limited in distribution area and time. In April 2007, for example, there was a green-label &quot;The Hop&quot; variety.

The modern-day &quot;Yebisu&quot; is positioned as Sapporo&#x27;s &quot;luxury&quot; beer label. Sapporo describes it as a beer brand with &quot;a touch of class&quot;. It is a 100% malt beer.

&quot;Yebisu&quot; is notable in that its Japanese name includes the now-obsolete kana character &quot;we&quot; ( or ) for the even-older &quot;ye&quot; reading, an anachronism in keeping with historical kana orthography. This can lead to confusion when romanized, as the &quot;Y&quot; is not pronounced. The Tokyo neighborhood of Ebisu was named for the beer, which was originally produced there, though its name is spelled with a conventional &quot;e&quot; kana instead of &quot;we&quot;. The pronunciations of &quot;Yebisu&quot; and &quot;Ebisu&quot; are the same.

===Space Barley===
Using barley grown from seeds which spent five months on board the International Space Station in 2006, Sapporo created a limited Space Barley brew. The project was a joint one between the Russian Academy of Sciences, Okayama University, and Sapporo. Tasters described the flavour as no different from similar beers, which researchers point to as important in showing that producing food in space for long duration flights is possible. Six packs of the space beer were sold in a lottery system for 10,000 yen.

<text>Raijin Comics is a discontinued manga anthology published from 2002 until 2004 in North America by the now-defunct Gutsoon! Entertainment and largely backed by the Sega Corporation at its inception. The collected volumes of &quot;Raijin Comics&quot; titles were published under the &quot;Raijin Graphic Novels&quot; imprint. The magazine was aimed at mature readers.

Premiering with a cover date of December 18, 2002, &quot;Raijin&quot; was initially published on a weekly basis similar to various popular manga magazines in Japan, including Coamix&#x27;s own &quot;Weekly Comic Bunch&quot;. However, distribution problems made the weekly schedule difficult to maintain and the weekly format ceased with issue #36 (September 10, 2003), becoming a monthly publication from issue #37 (October 2003). The magazine eventually ceased publication with issue #46 (July 2004). Its failure to break into the U.S. market has been attributed to competition with the North American version of &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, which debuted shortly afterward, despite the fact that they were aimed at different age range. Also, unlike Jump, many of the titles in Raijin lacked general brand awareness amongst casual American manga fans.

On May 5, 2005, Raijin lost control of the raijincomics.com domain name to domain squatters. The corporate website,  remained in operation for many years but wasn&#x27;t updated after June 2004, and as of mid-2010, has been taken over by domain squatters. Since the folding of &quot;Raijin Comics&quot;, some of its titles (&quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, &quot;Guardian Angel Getten&quot; and &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;) have since been licensed to other companies.

<doc id="1303647" wikidata="Q5057609" url="?curid=1303647" title="Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee">
<text>Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee (; lit. &quot;Cases of Judge Dee&quot;), also known as Di Gong An or Dee Goong An, is an 18th-century Chinese &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; detective novel by an anonymous author, &quot;Buti zhuanren&quot; (Chinese: 不题撰人). It is loosely based on the stories of Di Renjie (Wade-Giles Ti Jen-chieh), a county magistrate and statesman of the Tang court, who lived roughly 630–700. Though set in Tang dynasty China, the novel also contains cultural elements from later dynasties. A translated version was released by Robert van Gulik in 1949; van Gulik would go on to write his own series of Judge Dee novels, starting with &quot;The Chinese Maze Murders&quot;.

==Translation==

The Dutch sinologist and diplomat Robert van Gulik came across a copy in a second-hand book store in Tokyo and translated the novel into English. He then used it as the basis to create his own original Judge Dee stories over the next 20 years. Van Gulik wrote:

:This translation is chiefly a product of the Pacific War years, 1941-1945, when constant travel on various war duties made other more complicated Sinological research impossible.

:This novel &quot;Dee Goong An&quot; is offered here in a complete translation. Possibly it would have had a wider appeal if it had been entirely re-written in a form more familiar to our readers.

The translation was first privately printed on behalf of Van Gulik by the Toppan Printing Company of Tokyo, in a limited run of 1200 numbered signed copies.

The translation features nine drawings, three copies from old Chinese art, and six illustrations by the author.

===&quot;Four Great Strange Cases of Empress Wu&#x27;s Reign&quot;===
As carefully noted in his scholarly postscript, the present book is in fact a translation of only about half (31 out of 65 chapters) of a Chinese book in Van Gulik&#x27;s possession, entitled &quot;Four Great Strange Cases of Empress Wu&#x27;s Reign&quot;. Van Gulik obtained three editions of that book – a 19th-century manuscript and two printed editions, published respectively in 1903 and in 1947 at Shanghai. There were many differences between variant texts, Van Gulik considering the 19th century version the best and basing his translation mainly on it.

The part which Van Gulik translated describes Judge Dee simultaneously solving three difficult criminal cases, culminating with his being rewarded by promotion to the Imperial court (which, Van Gulik notes, was the traditional culmination of a Chinese story about an official). The later 34 chapters described events at the Court (where the historical Judge Dee is known to have been a valued adviser to Empress Wu, though his career suffered various ups and downs).

Based on textual analysis, Van Gulik became convinced that the second part was a later addition written by &quot;a person of feeble talents&quot;. As stated in the postscript, &quot;Part I is written in a fairly compact style and cleverly composed. The style of part II, on the contrary, is prolix and repetitious, the plot is clumsy and the characters badly drawn. Further, while Part I is written with considerable restraint, in part II there occur passages which are plain pornography, e.g. where the relations of the Empress Wu with the priest Huai-i are described&quot;. Moreover, Part II did not describe a detective investigation at all, but rather dealt mainly with court intrigues and power struggles - and thus did not serve Van Gulik&#x27;s aim of presenting Chinese crime fiction to Western readers.

For all these reasons Van Gulik decided to translate the first part only. The title given, &quot;Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee&quot;, is what Van Gulik assumed the original work was called, before the second part was added. However, he never actually obtained a copy of that original work or a conclusive evidence that it had existed under that name. The second part, of which Van Gulik so strongly disapproved, was apparently never translated - leaving western readers with no way of independently evaluating Van Gulik&#x27;s scathing criticism.

==Plot introduction==
There are three cases in this book. The first might be called &quot;The Double Murder at Dawn&quot;; the case describes the hazardous life of the traveling silk merchant and a murder which is committed to gain wealth.

The second, &quot;The Strange Corpse&quot;, takes place in a small village and addresses a crime of passion which proves hard to solve. The criminal is a very determined woman.

The third case, &quot;The Poisoned Bride&quot;, addresses the poisoning of a local scholar&#x27;s daughter, who marries the son of the former administrator of the district and dies mysteriously on her wedding night. This case contains a surprising twist in its solution.

All three cases are solved by Judge Dee, the district magistrate, detective, prosecutor, judge, and jury all wrapped up into one person. His powers are vast, and some of the things he can do would be manifestly illegal in a Western judicial system - such as grossly intimidating a witness or suspect, up to and including the extraction of a confession by torture. In contrast, making a false judgement could be far more perilous to a magistrate like Dee than to a modern western judge. Exhuming a dead body without proving the dead person was murdered would be an act of sacrilege which would cost the Judge his job (which very nearly happens to Dee in the course of the book). If a magistrate sentenced a person to death and the executed was afterwards proved to have been innocent, the magistrate would be himself executed - having made an honest mistake would not be sufficient to save him. Should an innocent person die under torture, both the judge ordering the torture and all members of staff administering the torture would suffer capital punishment - and members of Dee&#x27;s staff urging him to cease torture when the suspect proves obdurate shows they are aware of that dire risk to themselves.

The three cases offer a glimpse into the lives of different classes in traditional Chinese society: adventurous traders who travel vast distances along the trade routes up and down the land of China, and who are sometimes targeted by robbers and sometimes form dubious partnerships or turn outright robbers themselves; the small-scale shopkeepers and townspeople, who live within a narrow circumscribed life of routine which some find stifling; the gentry of literati, who by long tradition were considered as the land&#x27;s rulers and so considered themselves.

Any official departure of Judge Dee from the court compound (which also includes his private living quarters) is done with fanfare, accompanied by a large retinue of constables and officials. This approach is sometimes useful - especially when suspects are to be overawed and intimidated, or recalcitrant local officials intimidated into fully cooperating with an investigation. Sometimes, however, Judge Dee finds it expedient to go out incognito and carry out an investigation in disguise. He carries off very well the disguise of an itinerant physician; as Van Gulik points out, knowledge of medicine was expected of Chinese literati. Conversely, Judge Dee is less successful in passing himself off as a merchant, a member of a completely different social class; an observant merchant quickly unmasks him as what he is, a member of the Literati elite. Fortunately, it turns out that this observant merchant is not the wanted criminal; on the contrary, he is an honest merchant, with his own accounts to settle with the criminal, and becomes a very valuable ally.

Judge Dee acts according to very strict ethics, regarding himself as duty bound to enforce justice, seek out, and severely punish all wrong-doers, high or low. Some remarks made by various characters and references made to other magistrates make clear that Dee&#x27;s conduct is far from universal among District Judges. Others of Dee&#x27;s colleagues might have been more lenient with a suspected murderer when he was a member of a rich family and an outstanding student of literature; or would not have exerted themselves to catch the murderer of a &quot;small&quot; shop-keeper in a minor provincial town; or would have thought more of lining their own pockets than of seeing justice done. Judge Dee&#x27;s honesty and probity were proverbial - which is why tales were told of him even more than a thousand years after his death.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;&quot;Dee Goong An&quot; is the genuine article, dating from the 18th century and barely modified by the translator to make it intelligible today. Like his modern fictions, it adroitly intertwines three plots and shows the judge and his aides in their now familiar guise. The introduction and notes (including Chinese ideograms for the skeptical) are as entertaining as the tale, once the reader has become a Dee-votee&quot;.

: &quot;All attempts at detecting and attributing climate change signals need a reliable observed data set and simulations with mechanisms that drive climate change included. In a nutshell, this paper is important because it was the first study to investigate the effect of sulphate aerosols in a general circulation model of the climate system. The experiments simulate the climate back to 1860 (which is when the global records of surface temperature became reliable)... After 1970 our model with greenhouse gases alone begins to depart significantly from the observations. However, when we included sulphate aerosols, which have a cooling effect, the model agreed with the data from the 1930s and onwards. The rapid warming that has taken place since 1970 is, according to the model, attributable to a heating effect from greenhouse gases and a cooling effect from sulphate aerosols.&quot;

<doc id="1303657" wikidata="Q4826265" url="?curid=1303657" title="Autoethnography">
<text>Autoethnography is a form of ethnographic research in which a researcher connects personal experiences to wider cultural, political, and social meanings and understandings. It is considered a form of qualitative and arts-based research.

Autoethnography has been used across various disciplines, including anthropology, arts education, communication studies, education, educational administration, English literature, ethnic studies, gender studies, history, human resource development, marketing, music therapy, nursing, organizational behavior, paramedicine, performance studies, physiotherapy, psychology, social work, sociology, and theology and religious studies.

== Definitions ==
Historically, researchers have had trouble reaching a consensus regarding the definition of autoethnography. Whereas some scholars situate autoethnography within the family of narrative methods, others place it within the ethnographic tradition. However, it generally refers to research that involves critical observation of an individual&#x27;s lived experiences and connecting those experience to broader cultural, political, and social concepts.

Autoethnography can refer to research in which a researcher reflexively studies a group they belong to or their subjective experience. In the 1970s, autoethnography was more narrowly defined as &quot;insider ethnography&quot;, referring to studies of the (culture of) a group of which the researcher is a member.

According to Adams et al., autoethnography

# uses a researcher&#x27;s personal experience to describe and critique cultural beliefs, practices, and experiences; 
# acknowledges and values a researcher&#x27;s relationships with others
# uses deep and careful self-reflection—typically referred to as “reflexivity”—to name and interrogate the intersections between self and society, the particular and the general, the personal and the political
# shows people in the process of figuring out what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggles
# balances intellectual and methodological rigor, emotion, and creativity
# strives for social justice and to make life better.
Bochner and Ellis have also defined autoethnography as &quot;an autobiographical genre of writing and research that displays multiple layers of consciousness, connecting the personal to the cultural.&quot; They further indicate that autoethnography is typically written in first-person and can &quot;appear in a variety of forms,&quot; such as &quot;short stories, poetry, fiction, novels, photographic essays, personal essays, journals, fragmented and layered writing, and social science prose.&quot;

==History==

=== Mid-1800s ===
Anthropologists began conducting ethnographic research in the mid-1800s to study the cultures people they deemed &quot;exotic&quot; and/or &quot;primitive.&quot; Typically, these early ethnographers aimed to merely observe and write &quot;objective&quot; accounts of these groups to provide others a better understanding of various cultures. They also &quot;recognized and wrestled with questions of how to render textual accounts that would provide clear, accurate, rich descriptions of cultural practices of others&quot; and &quot;were concerned with offering valid, reliable, and objective interpretations in their writings.&quot;

=== Early- to mid-1900s ===
In the early to mid 1900s, it became clear that observation and fieldwork interfered with the cultural groups&#x27; natural and typical behaviors. Additionally, researchers realized the role they play in analyzing others&#x27; behaviors. As such, &quot;serious questions arose about the possibility and legitimacy of offering purely objective accounts of cultural practices, traditions, symbols, meanings, premises, rituals, rules, and other social engagements.&quot;

To help combat potential issues of validity, ethnographers began using what Gilbert Ryle refers to as &quot;thick description&quot;: a description of human social behavior in which the writer-researcher describes the behavior and provides &quot;commentary on, context for, and interpretation of these behaviors into the text.&quot; By doing so, the researcher aims to &quot;evoke a cultural scene vividly, in detail, and with care,&quot; so readers can understand and attempt to interpret the scene for themselves, much like in more traditional research methods.

A few ethnographers, especially those related to the Chicago school, began incorporating aspects of autoethnography into their work, such as narrated life histories. While they created more lifelike representations of their subject than their predecessors, these researchers often &quot;romanticized the subject&quot; by creating narratives with &quot;the three stages of the classic morality tale: being in a state of grace, being seduced by evil and falling from grace, and finally achieving redemption through suffering.&quot; Such researchers include Robert Parks, Nels Anderson, Everett Hughes, and Fred Davis.

During this time period, new theoretical constructs, such as feminism, began to emerge and with it, grew qualitative research. However, researchers were trying to &quot;fit the classical traditional model of internal and external validity to constructionist and interactionist conceptions of the research act.&quot;

=== 1970s ===
With the growth of qualitative research from the mid-1900s, &quot;a few scholars were urging thicker descriptions, giving more attention to concrete details of everyday life, renouncing the ethics and artificiality of experimental studies, and complaining about the obscurity of jargon and technical language, ... but social scientists, for the most part, weren&#x27;t all that concerned about the researcher&#x27;s location in the text, the capacity of language to accurately represent reality, or the need for researcher reflexivity.&quot;

The term &quot;autoethnography&quot; was first used in 1975, when Heider connected individuals&#x27; personal experiences to larger, cultural beliefs and traditions. In Heider&#x27;s case, the individual self referred to the people he was studying rather than himself. Because the people he studied were providing their personal accounts and experiences, Heider considered the work autoethnographic.

Later in the 1970s, researchers began more clearly stating their positionality and indicating how their mere presence altered the behaviors of the groups they studied. Further, researchers distinguished between people who researched groups of which they were a part (i.e., cultural insiders) and those who researched groups of which they were not a part (i.e., cultural outsiders). At this point, the term &quot;autoethnography&quot; began to refer to forms of ethnography in which the researcher is a cultural insider.

Walter Goldschmidt proposed that all ethnography is, in some way, autobiographical, because &quot;ethnographic representations privilege personal beliefs, perspectives, and observations.&quot; As an anthropologist, David Hayano was interested in the role that an individual&#x27;s own identity had in their research. Unlike more traditional research methods, Hayano believed there was value in a researcher &quot;conducting and writing ethnographies of their own people.&quot;

While researchers recognized the part they played in understanding a group of people, none focused explicitly on the &quot;inclusion and importance of personal experience in research.&quot;

=== 1980s ===
More generally in the 1980s, researchers began questioning and critiquing the role of the researcher, especially in social sciences. Multiple researchers aimed to make &quot;research and writing more reflexive and called into question the issues of gender, class, and race.&quot; As a result of these concerns, researchers purposefully inserted themselves as characters in the ethnographic narrative as a way of navigating the problem of researcher interference. Additionally, some of the predmoninant ways of understanding truth were eroded, and &quot;[i]ssues such as validity, reliability, and objectivity ... were once again problematic. Pattern and interpretive theories, as opposed to causal linear theories, were now more common as writers continued to challenge older models of truth and meaning.&quot;

In addition to and perhaps because of the above, researchers became interested in the importance of culture and storytelling as they gradually became more engaged through the personal aspects in ethnographic practices.

In 1988, John Van Maanen noted three predominant ways ethnographers write about culture:

# &quot;Realist Tales&quot;, in which the researcher uses a &quot;dispassionate, third-person voice&quot; and attempts to provide an &quot;accurate&quot; and &quot;objective&quot; account of the group studied without provider much researcher response
# &quot;Confessional Tales&quot;, which include the researchers&#x27; &quot;highly personalized styles&quot; and responses to the observed data
# &quot;Impressionist Tales&quot;, in which the researcher uses first-person to craft a &quot;tightly focused, vibrant, exact, but necessarily imaginative rendering of fieldwork&quot;

At the end of the 1980s, scholars began to apply the term &quot;autoethnography&quot; to work that used confessional and impressionist forms as they recognized that &quot;the richness of cultural lives and life practices of others cannot be fully captured or evoked in purely objective or descriptive language.&quot;

=== 1990s to present ===
In the early- to mid-1990s, researchers aimed to address the concerns raised in the previous decades regarding questions of legitimacy and reliability of ethnographic approaches. One way to do that was to directly place oneself into the research narrative, noting the positionality of the researcher. Here, the researcher could either insert themselves into the research narrative or increase participants&#x27; involvement in the research project, such as through participatory action research.

Autoethnography became more popular in the 1990s for ethnographers who aimed to use &quot;personal experience and reflexivity to examine cultural experiences.&quot; Series such as &quot;Ethnographic Alternatives&quot; and the first &quot;Handbook of Qualitative Research&quot; were published to better explain the importance of autoethnographic use, and key texts focused specifically on autoethnography were published, including Carolyn Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Investigating Subjectivity,&quot; &quot;Final Negotiations, The Ethnographic I,&quot; and &quot;Revision&quot;, as well as Art Bochner&#x27;s &quot;Coming to Narrative&quot;. In 2013, Tony Adams, Stacy Holman Jones, and Carolyn Ellis co-edited the first edition of the &quot;Handbook of Autoethnography.&quot; They published &quot;Autoethnography&quot; in 2015 and the second edition of the &quot;Handbook of Autoethnography&quot; in 2022. In 2020, Adams and Andrew Herrmann started the &quot;Journal of Autoethnography&quot; with the University of California Press. In 2021, Marlen Harrison started &quot;The Autoethnographer&quot;, a Literary &amp; Arts Magazine. In 2023, Tony Adams launched the Certificate in Autoethnography program at Bradley University. 

In the 2000s, major conferences began to regularly accept autoethnographic work, starting primarily with the International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry (2005). Other conferences that foreground autoethnographic research include the International Symposium on Autoethnography and Narrative (formerly Doing Autoethnography), the International Conference of Autoethnography (formerly British Autoethnography), and Critical Autoethnography.

Today, ethnographers typically use a &quot;kind of hybrid form of confessional-impressionist tale&quot; that includes &quot;performative, poetic, impressionistic, symbolic, and lyrical language&quot; while also &quot;focusing closely on the self-data inherent in confessional writing.&quot;

==Epistemological and theoretical basis==

Autoethnography differs from ethnography in that autoethnography embraces and foregrounds the researcher&#x27;s subjectivity rather than attempting to limit it as in empirical research. As Carolyn Ellis explains, &quot;autoethnography overlaps art and science; it is part &quot;auto&quot; or self and part &quot;ethno&quot; or culture.&quot;Importantly, it is also &quot;something different from both of them, greater than its parts.&quot; In other words, as Ellingson and Ellis put it, &quot;whether we call a work an &quot;autoethnography&quot; or an &quot;ethnography&quot; depends as much on the claims made by authors as anything else.&quot;

In embracing personal thoughts, feelings, stories, and observations as a way of understanding the social context they are studying, autoethnographers are also shedding light on their total interaction with that setting by making their every emotion and thought visible to the reader. This is much the opposite of theory-driven, hypothesis-testing research methods that are based on the positivist epistemology. In this sense, Ellingson and Ellis see autoethnography as a social constructionist project that rejects the deep-rooted binary oppositions between the researcher and the researched, objectivity and subjectivity, process and product, self and others, art and science, and the personal and the political.

Autoethnographers, therefore, tend to reject the concept of social research as an objective and neutral knowledge produced by scientific methods, which can be characterized and achieved by detachment of the researcher from the researched. Autoethnography, in this regard, is a critical &quot;response to the alienating effects on both researchers and audiences of impersonal, passionless, abstract claims of truth generated by such research practices and clothed in exclusionary scientific discourse.&quot; Deborah Reed-Danahay (1997) also argues that autoethnography is a postmodernist construct:
The concept of autoethnography...synthesizes both a postmodern ethnography, in which the realist conventions and objective observer position of standard ethnography have been called into question, and a postmodern autobiography, in which the notion of the coherent, individual self has been similarly called into question. The term has a double sense - referring either to the ethnography of one&#x27;s own group or to autobiographical writing that has ethnographic interest. Thus, either a self- (auto-) ethnography or an autobiographical (auto-) ethnography can be signaled by &quot;autoethnography.
== Process ==
As a method, autoethnography combines characteristics of autobiography and ethnography.

To form the autobiographical aspects of the autoethnography, the author will write retroactively and selectively about past experiences. Unlike other forms of research, the author typically did not live through such experiences solely to create a publishable document; rather, the experiences are assembled using hindsight. Additionally, authors may conduct formal or informal interview and/or consult relevant texts (e.g., diaries or photographs) to help with recall. The experiences are tied together using literary elements &quot;to create evocative and specific representations of the culture/cultural experience and to give audiences a sense of how being there in the experience feels.&quot;

Ethnography, on the other hand, involves observing and writing about culture. During the first stage, researchers will observe and interview individuals of the selected cultural group and take detailed fieldnotes. Ethnographers discover their findings through induction. That is, ethnographers do not go into the field looking for specific answers; rather, their observations, writing, and fieldnotes yield the findings. Such findings are conveyed to others through thick description so that readers may come to their own conclusions regarding the situation described.

Autoethnography uses aspects of autobiography (e.g., personal experiences and recall) and ethnography (e.g., interviews, observations, and fieldnotes) to create vivid descriptions that connect to the personal to the cultural.

==Types==
Because autoethnography is a broad and ambiguous &quot;category that encompasses a wide array of practices,&quot; autoethnographies &quot;vary in their emphasis on the writing and research process (&quot;graphy&quot;), on culture (&quot;ethnos&quot;), and on self (&quot;auto&quot;).&quot; More recently, autoethnography has been separated into two distinct subtypes: analytic and evocative. According to Ellingson and Ellis, &quot;Analytic autoethnographers focus on developing theoretical explanations of broader social phenomena, whereas evocative autoethnographers focus on narrative presentations that open up conversations and evoke emotional responses.&quot;Scholars also discuss visual autoethnography, which incorporates imagery along with written analysis.

=== Analytic autoethnography ===
Analytic autoethnography focuses on &quot;developing theoretical explanations of broader social phenomena&quot; and aligns with more traditional forms of research that value &quot;generalization, distanced analysis, and theory-building.&quot;

This form has five key features:

# complete member researcher (CMR) status
# analytic reflexivity
# narrative visibility of the researcher&#x27;s self
# dialogue with informants beyond the self
# commitment to theoretical analysis

First, in all forms of autoethnography, the researcher must be a member of the cultural group they are study and thus, have CMR status. This cultural group may be loosely connected without knowledge of one another (e.g., people with disabilities) or tightly connected (e.g., members of a small church). CMR status helps the research &quot;approximate the emotional stance of the people they study,&quot; thereby addressing some criticisms of ethnography. Like the evocative autoethnographer, the analytic autoethnographer &quot;is personally engaged in a social group, setting, or culture as a full member and active participant.&quot; However, they &quot;retains a distinct and highly visible identity as a self-aware scholar and social actor within the ethnographic text.&quot;

Two CMR status types are recognized: opportunistic and convert. Opportunistic CMRs exist as part of the cultural group they aim to study prior to deciding to research the group. To receive this insider status, the researcher &quot;may be born into a group, thrown into a group by chance circumstance (e.g., illness), or have acquired intimate familiarity through occupational, recreational, or lifestyle participation.&quot; Conversely, convert CMRs &quot;begin with a purely data-oriented research interest in the setting but become converted to complete immersion and membership during the course of the research.&quot; Here, a researcher will opt to study a cultural group, then become ingrained into that culture throughout the research process.

Second, when conducting analytic autoethnography, the researcher must utilize analytic reflexivity. That is, they must express their &quot;awareness of their necessary connection to the research situation and hence their effects upon it,&quot; making themselves &quot;visible, active, and reflexively engaged in the text.&quot;

Thirdly and similarly, the researcher should be visibly present throughout the narrative and &quot;should illustrate analytic insights through recounting their own experiences and thoughts as well as those of others.&quot; Beyond this, analytic autoethnographers &quot;should openly discuss changes in their beliefs and relationships over the course of fieldwork, thus vividly revealing themselves as people grappling with issues relevant to membership and participation in fluid rather than static social worlds.&quot;

Conversely, the fourth concept aims to prevent the text from &quot;author saturation,&quot; which centers the author more than the culture being observed. While &quot;analytic autoethnography is grounded inself-experience,&quot; it should &quot;[reach] beyond it as well,&quot; perhaps including interviews with and/or observations of with others who are members of the culture studied. This connection to the culture moves the autoethnography beyond a mere autobiography or memoir.

Lastly, analytic autoethnography should commit to an analytic agenda. That is, the analytic autoethnography should not merely &quot;document personal experience,&quot; &quot;provide an &#x27;insider&#x27;s perspective,&#x27;&quot; or &quot;evoke emotional resonance with the reader.&quot; Rather, it should &quot;use empirical data to gain insight into some broader set of social phenomena than those provided by the data themselves.&quot;

Although Leon Anderson (academic) conceptualized analytic autoethnography alongside evocative autoethnography, Anderson critiques the false dichotomy between analytic and evocative autoethnography in his chapter, &quot;I Learn by Going: Autoethnographic Modes of Inquiry&quot; (co-authored with Bonnie Glass-Coffin), the lead chapter in the first edition of the &quot;Handbook of Autoethnography&quot;.

=== Evocative autoethnography ===
Evocative autoethnography &quot;focus[es] on narrative presentations that open up conversations and evoke emotional responses.&quot; According to Bochner and Ellis, the goal is for the readers to see themselves in the autoethnographer so they transform private troubles into public plight, making it powerful, comforting, dangerous, and culturally essential. Accounts are presented like novels or biographies and thus, fracture the boundaries that normally separate literature from social science.

=== Symbiotic autoethnography ===

Symbiotic autoethnography suggests a way of reconciling the differences in various types of autoethnography through suggesting an innovative symbiotic approach. The author uses the concept of &#x27;symbiosis&#x27; in its broader sense to denote close interdependence and interrelation between its suggested seven attributes, including temporality, researcher&#x27;s omnipresence, evocative storytelling, interpretative analysis, political (transformative) focus, reflexivity and polyvocality.

=== Auto-ethnographic design ===
Auto-ethnographic design is a materially-oriented practice that ties design research with expression. According to Schouwenberg and Kaethler, &quot;There is a break here between the autoethnographic tradition and how it is taken up in design, where for the &#x27;graphy&#x27; the act of reporting and reflection is replaced by creative production; design activates the knowledge component by directly engaging and altering the very world it seeks to make sense of&quot;. In contrast to other forms of design, auto-ethnographic designs are deeply personal and tend towards the artistic, using materiality as a way of understanding the self and communicating it. The hyphen that separates auto and ethnography represents the materiality that is needed to understand the self. It is critiqued for being excessively naval gazing.

=== Minor literature autoethnography ===
Minor literature autoethnography (MLA) draws on the concept of &#x27;minor literature&#x27; as developed by Deleuze and Guattari, which refers to the use of a major language from a minoritarian perspective to challenge dominant cultural narratives. According to De Jong this type of autoethnography focuses on the experiences of marginalized groups and individuals who use the language of the majority to articulate their unique cultural positions and create new forms of expression. By doing so, minor literature autoethnography aims to reveal and critique power structures and give voice to perspectives that are often silenced or overlooked.

== Goals ==
Adams, Ellis, and Jones recognize two primary purposes for practicing autoethnographic research. Given the complicated history of ethnography, &quot;autoethnographers speak against, or provide alternatives to, dominant, taken-for-granted, and harmful cultural scripts, stories, and stereotypes&quot; and &quot;offer accounts of personal experience to complement, or fill gaps in, existing research.&quot;As with other forms of qualitative research, autoethnographic &quot;accounts may show how the desire for, and practice of, generalization in research can mask important nuances of cultural issues.&quot;

In addition to providing nuanced accounts of cultural phenomena, Adams, Ellis, and Jones argue that the goal of autoethnography &quot;is to articulate insider knowledge of cultural experience.&quot; Underlying this argument is the assumption that &quot;the writer can inform readers about aspects of cultural life that other researchers may not be able to know.&quot; Importantly, &quot;[i]nsider knowledge does not suggest that an autoethnographer can articulate more truthful or more accurate knowledge as compared to outsiders, but rather that as authors we can tell our stories in novel ways when compared to how others may be able to tell them.&quot;

== Uses ==
Autoethnography is utilized across a variety of disciplines and can be presented in many forms, including but not limited to &quot;short stories, poetry, fiction, novels, photographic essays, personal essays, journals, fragmented and layered writing, and social science prose.&quot;

Symbolic interactionists are particularly interested autoethnography, and examples can be found in a number of scholarly journals, such as &quot;Qualitative Inquiry&quot;, the &quot;Journal of the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interactionism&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Contemporary Ethnography&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of Humanistic Ethnography&quot;.

In performance studies, autoethnography acknowledges the researcher and the audience having equal weight. Portraying the performed &quot;self&quot; through writing then becomes an aim to create an embodied experience for the writer and the reader. This area acknowledges the inward and outward experience of ethnography in experiencing the subjectivity of the author. Audience members may experience the work of ethnography through reading/hearing/feeling (inward) and then have a reaction to it (outward), maybe by emotion. Ethnography and performance work together to invoke emotion in the reader.

Autoethnography is also used in film as a variant of the standard documentary film. It differs from the traditional documentary film in that its subject is the filmmaker. An autoethnographical film typically relates the life experiences and thoughts, views, and beliefs of the filmmaker, and as such, it is often considered to be rife with bias and image manipulation. Unlike other documentaries, autoethnographies do not usually make a claim of objectivity.

== Storyteller/narrator ==
In different academic disciplines (particularly communication studies and performance studies), the term autoethnography itself is contested and is sometimes used interchangeably with or referred to as personal narrative or autobiography. Autoethnographic methods include journaling, looking at archival records (whether institutional or personal), interviewing one&#x27;s own self, and using writing to generate a self-cultural understandings. Reporting an autoethnography might take the form of a traditional journal article or scholarly book, performed on the stage, or be seen in the popular press. Autoethnography can include direct (and participant) observation of daily behavior; unearthing of local beliefs and perception and recording of life history (e.g. kinship, education, etc.); and in-depth interviewing: &quot;The analysis of data involves interpretation on the part of the researcher&quot; (Hammersley in Genzuk). However, rather than a portrait of the Other (person, group, culture), the difference is that the researcher is constructing a portrait of the self.

Autoethnography can also be &quot;associated with narrative inquiry and autobiography&quot; in that it foregrounds experience and story as a meaning-making enterprise. Maréchal argues that &quot;narrative inquiry can provoke identification, feelings, emotions, and dialogue.&quot; Furthermore, the increased focus on incorporating autoethnography and Narrative Inquiry into qualitative research indicates a growing concern for how the style of academic writing informs the types of claims made. As Laurel Richardson articulates &quot;I consider writing as a method of inquiry, a way of finding out about a topic...form and content are inseparable.&quot; For many researchers, experimenting with alternative forms of writing and reporting, including autoethnography, personal narrative, performative writing, layered accounts and writing stories, provides a way to create multiple layered accounts of a research study, creating not only the opportunity to create new and provocative claims but also the ability to do so in a compelling manner. Ellis (2004) says that autoethnographers advocate &quot;the conventions of literary writing and expression&quot; in that &quot;autoethnographic forms feature concrete action, emotion, embodiment, self-consciousness, and introspection portrayed in dialogue, scenes, characterization, and plot&quot; (p. xix).

According to Bochner and Ellis (2006), an autoethnographer is &quot;first and foremost a communicator and a storyteller.&quot; In other words, autoethnography &quot;depicts people struggling to overcome adversity&quot; and shows &quot;people in the process of figuring out what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggles&quot; (p. 111). Therefore, according to them, autoethnography is &quot;ethical practice&quot; and &quot;gifts&quot; that has a caregiving function (p. 111). In essence autoethnography is a story that re-enacts an experience by which people find meaning and through that meaning are able to be okay with that experience.

In Dr. Mayukh Dewan&#x27;s opinion, this can be a problem because many readers may see us as being too self-indulgent but they have to realise that our stories and experiences we share are not solely ours, but rather that they also represent the group we are autoethnographically representing.

In this storytelling process, the researcher seeks to make meaning of a disorienting experience. A life example in which autoethnography could be applied is the death of a family member or someone close by. In this painful experience people often wonder how they will go about living without this person and what it will be like. In this scenario, especially in religious homes, one often asks &quot;Why God?&quot; thinking that with an answer as to why the person died they can go about living. Others, wanting to be able to offer up an explanation to make the person feel better, generally say things such as &quot;At least they are in a better place&quot; or &quot;God wanted him/her home.&quot; People, who are never really left with an explanation as to why, generally fall back on the reason that &quot;it was their time to go&quot; and through this somewhat &quot;explanation&quot; find themselves able to move on and keep living life. Over time when looking back at the experience of someone close to you dying, one may find that through this hardship they became a stronger more independent person, or that they grew closer to other family members. With these realizations, the person has actually made sense of and has become fine with the tragic experience that occurred. And through this autoethnography is performed.

==Evaluation==
The main critique of autoethnography—and qualitative research in general—comes from the traditional social science methods that emphasize the objectivity of social research. In this critique, qualitative researchers are often called &quot;journalists, or soft scientists,&quot; and their work, including autoethnography, is &quot;termed unscientific, or only exploratory, or entirely personal and full of bias.&quot; Many quantitative researchers regard the materials produced by narrative as &quot;the means by which a narrating subject, autonomous and independent...can achieve authenticity...This represents an almost total failure to use narrative to achieve serious social analysis.&quot;

According to Maréchal, the early criticism of autobiographical methods in anthropology was about &quot;their validity on grounds of being unrepresentative and lacking objectivity.&quot; She also points out that evocative and emotional genres of autoethnography have been criticized by mostly analytic proponents for their &quot;lack of ethnographic relevance as a result of being too personal.&quot; As she writes, they are criticized &quot;for being biased, navel-gazing, self-absorbed, or emotionally incontinent, and for hijacking traditional ethnographic purposes and scholarly contribution.&quot;

The reluctance to accept narrative work as serious extends far beyond the realm of academia. In 1994, Arlene Croce refused to evaluate or even attend Bill T. Jones &quot;Still/Here&quot; performance. She echoed a quantitative stance towards narrative research by explaining
I can&#x27;t review someone I feel sorry or hopeless about...I&#x27;m &quot;forced&quot; to feel sorry because of the way they present themselves as: dissed blacks, abused women, or disenfranchised homosexuals—as performers, in short, who make victimhood victim art
Croce illustrates what Adams, Jones, and Ellis refer to as &quot;illusory boundaries and borders between scholarship and criticism.&quot; These &quot;borders&quot; are seen to hide or take away from the idea that autoethnographic evaluation and criticism present another personal story about the experience of an experience. Or as Craig Gingrich-Philbrook wrote, &quot;any evaluation of autoethnography...is simply another story from a highly situated, privileged, empowered subject about something he or she experienced.&quot;

===Rethinking traditional criteria===

In her book&#x27;s tenth chapter, titled &quot;Evaluating and Publishing Autoethnography&quot; (pp. 252–255), Ellis (2004) discusses how to evaluate an autoethnographic project, based on other authors&#x27; ideas about evaluating alternative modes of qualitative research. (See the special section in &quot;Qualitative Inquiry&quot; on &quot;Assessing Alternative Modes of Qualitative and Ethnographic Research: How Do We Judge? Who Judges?&quot;) She presents several criteria for &quot;good autoethnography&quot;, and indicates how these ideas resonate with each other.

First, Ellis mentions Richardson who described five factors she uses when reviewing personal narrative papers that includes analysis of both evaluative and constructive validity techniques. The criteria are:

::(a) Substantive contribution. Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?
::(b) Aesthetic merit. Does this piece succeed aesthetically? Is the text artistically shaped, satisfyingly complex, and not boring?
::(c) Reflexivity. How did the author come to write this text? How has the author&#x27;s subjectivity been both a producer and a product of this text?
::(d) Impactfulness. Does this affect me emotionally and/or intellectually? Does it generate new questions or move me to action?
::(e) Expresses a reality. Does this text embody a fleshed out sense of lived experience?

Autoethnographic manuscripts might include dramatic recall, unusual phrasing, and strong metaphors to invite the reader to &quot;relive&quot; events with the author. These guidelines may provide a framework for directing investigators and reviewers alike.

Further, Ellis suggests how Richardson&#x27;s criteria mesh with criteria mentioned by Bochner who describes what makes him understand and feel with a story (Bochner, 2000, pp. 264–266). He looks for concrete details (similar to Richardson&#x27;s expression of lived experience), structurally complex narratives (Richardson&#x27;s aesthetic merit), author&#x27;s attempt to dig under the superficial to get to vulnerability and honesty (Richardson&#x27;s reflexivity), a standard of ethical self-consciousness (Richardson&#x27;s substantive contribution), and a moving story (Richardson&#x27;s impact) (Ellis, 2004, pp. 253–254).

In 2015, Adams, Jones, and Ellis collaborated to bring about a similar list of Goals for Assessing Autoethnography. The list takes encompasses descriptive, prescriptive, practical, and theoretical goals for evaluating autoethnographic work (2015, pp. 102–104).

# Make contributions to knowledge
# Value the personal and experiential
# Demonstrate the power, craft, and responsibilities of stories and storytelling
# Take a relationally responsible approach to research practice and representation

==== Contributions to knowledge ====

Adams, Jones, and Ellis define the first goal of autoethnography as a conscious effort to &quot;extend existing knowledge and research while recognizing that knowledge is both situated and contested.&quot; As Adams explains in his critique of his work &quot;Narrating the Closet,&quot;

I knew I had to contribute to knowledge about coming out by saying something new about the experience...I also needed a new angle toward coming out; my experience, alone, of coming out was not sufficient to justify a narrative.
With the critic&#x27;s general decree of narrative as narcissism, Adams, Jones, and Ellis use the first goal of assessing autoethnography to explain the importance of striving to combine personal experience and existing theory while remaining mindful of the &quot;insider insight that autoethnography offers researchers, participants, and readers/audiences.&quot; Ellis&#x27; &quot;Maternal Connections&quot; can be considered a successful incorporation of the first goal in that she &quot;questions the idea of care-giving as a burden, instead of portraying caregiving as a loving and meaning-making relationship.&quot;

==== Value the personal and experiential ====

Adams, Jones, and Ellis define the second goal for assessing autoethnography with four elements which include featuring the perspective of the self in context and culture, exploring experience as a means of insight about social life, embracing the risks of presenting vulnerable selves in research, and using emotions and bodily experience as means and modes of understanding. This goal fully recognizes and commends the &quot;I&quot; in academic writing and calls for analysis of the subjective experience. In Jones&#x27; &quot;Lost and Found&quot; essay she writes, 

I convey the sadness and the joy I feel about my relationships with my adopted child, the child I chose not to adopt, and my grandmother. I focus on the emotions and bodily experiences of both losing and memorializing my grandmother&#x27;

The careful and deliberate incorporation of &quot;auto&quot; (the &quot;I,&quot; the self) into research is considered one of the most crucial aspects of the autoethnography process. The exploration of the ethics and care of presenting vulnerable selves is addressed at length by Adams in &quot;A Review of Narrative Ethics&quot;.

==== Stories and storytelling ====

Autoethnography showcases stories as the means in which sensemaking and researcher reflexivity create descriptions and critiques of culture. Adams, Jones, and Ellis write: 

Reflexivity includes both acknowledging and critiquing our place and privilege in society and using the stories we tell to &quot;break long-held silences&quot; on power, relationships, cultural taboos, and forgotten and/or suppressed experiences.

A focus is placed a writer&#x27;s ability to develop writing and representation skills alongside other analytic abilities. Adams switches between first-person and second-person narration in &quot;Living (In) the Closet: The Time of Being Closeted&quot; as a way to &quot;bring readers into my story, inviting them to live my experiences alongside me, feeling how I felt and suggesting how they might, under similar circumstances, act as I did.&quot; Similarly, Ellis in &quot;Maternal Connections&quot; chose to steer away from the inclusion of references to the research literature or theory instead opting to &quot;call on sensory details, movements, emotions, dialogue, and scene setting to convey an experience of taking care of a parent.&quot;
The examples included above are incomplete. Autoethnographers exploring different narrative structures can be seen in Andrew Herrmann&#x27;s use of layered accounts, Ellis&#x27; use of haibun, and the use of autoethnographic film by Rebecca Long and Anne Harris.

Addressing veracity and the art of story telling in his 2019 autoethnographic monograph &quot;Going All City: Struggle and Survival in LA&#x27;s Graffiti Subculture&quot;, Stefano Bloch writes &quot;I do rely on artful rendering, but not artistic license.&quot;

==== Relationally responsible approach ====

Among the concepts in qualitative research is &quot;relational responsibility&quot;. Researchers should work to make research relationships as collaborative, committed, and reciprocal as possible while taking care to safeguard identities and privacy of participants. Included under this concept is the accessibility of the work to a variety of readers which allows for the &quot;opportunity to engage and improve the lives of our selves, participants, and readers/audiences.&quot;
Autoethnographers struggle with relational responsibility as in Adams&#x27; critique of his work on coming out and recognizing:

...how others can perceive my ideas as &quot;relationally irresponsible&quot; concessions to homophobic others and to insidious heteronormative cultural structures; by &quot;not&quot; being aggressively critical, my work does not do enough to &quot;engage&quot; and &quot;improve&quot; the lives of others.

In the critique he also questions how relationally irresponsible he was by including several brief conversations in his work without consent and exploited other&#x27;s experiences for his own benefit. Similar sentiments are echoed throughout Adams, Jones, and Ellis critiques of their own writing.

====From &quot;validity&quot; to &quot;truth&quot;====
As an idea that emerged from the tradition of social constructionism and interpretive paradigm, autoethnography challenges the traditional social scientific methodology that emphasizes the criteria for quality in social research developed in terms of validity. Carolyn Ellis writes, In autoethnographic work, I look at validity in terms of what happens to readers as well as to research participants and researchers. To me, validity means that our work seeks verisimilitude; it evokes in readers a feeling that the experience described is lifelike, believable, and possible. You also can judge validity by whether it helps readers communicate with others different from themselves or offers a way to improve the lives of participants and readers—or even your own. In this sense, Ellis emphasizes the &quot;narrative truth&quot; for autoethnographic writings.
I believe you should try to construct the story as close to the experience as you can remember it, especially in the initial version. If you do, it will help you work through the meaning and purpose of the story. But it&#x27;s not so important that narratives represent lives accurately—only, as Art(Arthur Bochner) argues, &quot;that narrators believe they are doing so&quot; (Bochner, 2002, p. 86). Art believes that we can judge one narrative interpretation of events against another, but we cannot measure a narrative against the events themselves because the meaning of the events comes clear only in their narrative expression.
Instead, Ellis suggests to judge autoethnographic writings on the usefulness of the story, rather than only on accuracy. She quotes Art Bochner, who argues

that the real questions is what narratives do, what consequences they have, to what uses they can be put. Narrative is the way we remember the past, turn life into language, and disclose to ourselves and others the truth of our experiences. In moving from concern with the inner veridicality to outer pragmatics of evaluating stories, Plummer [2001, p. 401] also looks at uses, functions, and roles of stories, and adds that they &quot;need to have rhetorical power enhanced by aesthetic delight (Ellis, 2004, p. 126-127).

Similarly,

Laurel Richardson [1997, p. 92] uses the metaphor of a crystal to deconstruct traditional validity. A crystal has an infinite number of shapes, dimensions and angles. It acts as a prism and changes shape, but still has structure. Another writer, Patti Lather [1993, p. 674], proposes counter-practices of authority that rupture validity as a &quot;regime of truth&quot; and lead to a critical political agenda [Cf. Olesen, 2000, p. 231]. She mentions the four subtypes [pp. 685-686]: &quot;ironic validity, concerning the problems of representation; paralogical validity, which honors differences and uncertainties; rhizomatic validity, which seeks out multiplicity; and voluptuous validity, which seeks out ethics through practices of engagement and self-reflexivity (Ellis, 2004, pp. 124~125).

====From &quot;generalizability&quot; to &quot;resonance&quot;====

With regard to the term of &quot;generalizability&quot;, Ellis points out that autoethnographic research seeks generalizability not just from the respondents but also from the readers. Ellis says:

I would argue that a story&#x27;s generalizability is always being tested—not in the traditional way through random samples of respondents, but by readers as they determine if a story speaks to them about their experience or about the lives of others they know. Readers provide theoretical validation by comparing their lives to ours, by thinking about how our lives are similar and different and the reasons why. Some stories inform readers about unfamiliar people or lives. We can ask, after Stake [1994], &quot;does the story have &#x27;naturalistic generalization&#x27;?&quot; meaning that it brings &quot;felt&quot; news from one world to another and provides opportunities for the reader to have vicarious experience of the things told. The focus of generalizability moves from respondents to readers.(p. 195)

This generalizability through the resonance of readers&#x27; lives and &quot;lived experience&quot; (Richardson, 1997) in autoethnographic work, intends to open up rather than close down conversation (Ellis, 2004, p. 22).

===Benefits and concerns===

Denzin&#x27;s criterion is whether the work has the possibility to change the world and make it a better place (Denzin, 2000, p. 256). This position fits with Clough, who argues that good autoethnographic writing should motivate cultural criticism. Autoethnographic writing should be closely aligned with theoretical reflection, says Clough, so that it can serve as a vehicle for thinking &quot;new sociological subjects&quot; and forming &quot;new parameters of the social&quot; (Clough, 2000, p. 290). Though Richardson and Bochner are less overtly political than Denzin and Clough, they indicate that good personal narratives should contribute to positive social change and move us to action (Bochner, 2000, p. 271).

In addition to helping the researcher make sense of his or her individual experience, autoethnographies are political in nature as they engage their readers in political issues and often ask us to consider things, or do things differently. Chang argues that autoethnography offers a research method friendly to researchers and readers because autoethnographic texts are engaging and enable researchers to gain a cultural understanding of self in relation to others, on which cross-cultural coalition can be built between self and others.

Also, autoethnography as a genre frees us to move beyond traditional methods of writing, promoting narrative and poetic forms, displays of artifacts, photographs, drawings, and live performances (Cons, p. 449). Denzin says autoethnography must be literary, present cultural and political issues, and articulate a politics of hope. The literary criteria he mentions are covered in what Richardson advocates: aesthetic value. Ellis elaborates her idea in autoethnography as good writing that through the plot, dramatic tension, coherence, and verisimilitude, the author shows rather than tells, develops characters and scenes fully, and paints vivid sensory experiences.

While advocating autoethnography for its value, some researchers argue that there are also several concerns about autoethnography. Chang warns autoethnographers of pitfalls that they should avoid in doing autoethnography: (1) excessive focus on self in isolation from others; (2) overemphasis on narration rather than analysis and cultural interpretation; (3) exclusive reliance on personal memory and recalling as a data source; (4) negligence of ethical standards regarding others in self-narratives; and (5) inappropriate application of the label autoethnography.Also some qualitative researchers have expressed their concerns about the worth and validity of autoethnography. Robert Krizek (2003) contributed a chapter titled &quot;Ethnography as the Excavation of Personal Narrative&quot; (pp. 141–152) to the book of &quot;Expressions of Ethnography&quot; in which he expresses concern about the possibility for autoethnography to devolve into narcissism. Krizek goes on to suggest that autoethnography, no matter how personal, should always connect to some larger element of life.

One of the main advantages of personal narratives is that they give us access into learners&#x27; private worlds and provide rich data (Pavlenko, 2002, 2007). Another advantage is the ease of access to data since the researcher calls on his or her own experiences as the source from which to investigate a particular phenomenon. It is this advantage that also entails a limitation as, by subscribing analysis to a personal narrative, the research is also limited in its conclusions. However, Bochner and Ellis (1996) consider that this limitation on the self is not valid, since, &quot;If culture circulates through all of us, how can autoethnography be free of connection to a world beyond the self?.&quot;

== Criticisms and concerns ==
Similar to other forms of qualitative and art-based research, autoethnography has faced many criticisms. As Sparkes stated, &quot;The emergence of autoethnography and narratives of self...has not been trouble-free, and their status as proper research remains problematic.&quot;

The most recurrent criticism of autoethnography is of its strong emphasis on self, which is at the core of the resistance to accepting autoethnography as a valuable research method. Thus, autoethnographies have been criticised for being self-indulgent, narcissistic, introspective and individualised.

Another criticism is of the reality personal narratives or autoethnographies represent. As Geoffrey Walford states, &quot;If people wish to write fiction, they have every right to do so, but not every right to call it research.&quot; This criticism originates from a statement by Ellis and Bochner (2000), conceiving autoethnography as a narrative that &quot;is always a story about the past and not the past itself.&quot; To this, Walford asserts that &quot;the aim of research is surely to reduce the distortion as much as possible.&quot; Walford&#x27;s concerns are focused on how much of the accounts presented as autoethnographies represent real conversations or events as they happened and how much they are just inventions of the authors.

===Evaluation===

Several critiques exist regarding evaluating autoethnographical works grounded in interpretive paradigm.

From within qualitative research, some researchers have posited that autoethnographers, along with others, fail to meet positivist standards of validity and reliability. Schwandt, for instance, argues that some social researchers have &quot;come to equate being rational in social science with being procedural and criteriological.&quot; Building on quantitative foundations, Lincoln and Guba translate quantitative indicators into qualitative quality indicators, namely: credibility (parallels internal validity), transferability (parallels external validity), dependability (parallels reliability), and confirmability (parallels objectivity and seeks to critically examine whether the researcher has acted in good faith during the course of the research). Smith and Smith and Heshusius critique these qualitative translations and warn that the claim of compatibility (between qualitative and quantitative criteria) cannot be sustained, and by making such claims, researchers are in effect closing down the conversation. Smith points out that &quot;the assumptions of interpretive inquiry are incompatible with the desire for foundational criteria. How we are to work out this problem, one way or another, would seem to merit serious attention.

Secondly, some other researchers questions the need for specific criteria itself. Bochner and Clough both are concerned that too much emphasis on criteria will move us back to methodological policing and will takes us away from a focus on imagination, ethical issues in autographic work, and creating better ways of living. The autoethnographer internally judges its quality. Evidence is tacit, individualistic, and subjective. (see Ellis &amp; Bochner, 2003). Practice-based quality is based in the lived research experience itself rather than in its formal evidencing per se. Bochner says:
Self-narratives... are not so much academic as they are existential, reflecting a desire to grasp or seize the possibilities of meaning, which is what gives life its imaginative and poetic qualities... a poetic social science does not beg the question of how to separate good narrativization from bad... [but] the good ones help the reader or listener to understand and feel the phenomena under scrutiny.
Finally, in addition to this anti-criteria stance of some researchers, some scholars have suggested that the criteria used to judge autoethnography should not necessarily be the same as traditional criteria used to judge other qualitative research investigations (Garratt &amp; Hodkinson, 1999). They argue that autoethnography has been received with a significant degree of academic suspicion because it contravenes certain qualitative research traditions. The controversy surrounding autoethnography is in part related to the problematic exclusive use of the self to produce research (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1994). This use of self as the only data source in autoethnography has been questioned (see, for example, Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1994; Sparkes, 2000; Beattie, 2022). Accordingly, autoethnographies have been criticized for being too self-indulgent and narcissistic. Sparkes (2000) suggested that autoethnography is at the boundaries of academic research because such accounts do not sit comfortably with traditional criteria used to judge qualitative inquiries.

Holt associates this problem with this problem as two crucial issues in &quot;the fourth moment of qualitative research&quot; Denzin and Lincoln (2000) presented; the dual crises of representation and legitimation. The crisis of representation refers to the writing practices (i.e., how researchers write and represent the social world). Additionally, verification issues relating to methods and representation are (re)considered as problematic (Marcus &amp; Fischer, 1986). The crisis of legitimation questions traditional criteria used for evaluating and interpreting qualitative research, involving a rethinking of terms such as validity, reliability, and objectivity. Holt says:
Much like the autoethnographic texts themselves, the boundaries of research and their maintenance are socially constructed (Sparkes, 2000). In justifying autoethnography as proper research... ethnographers have acted autobiographically before, but in the past they may not have been aware of doing so, and taken their genre for granted (Coffey, 1999). Autoethnographies may leave reviewers in a perilous position... the reviewers were not sure if the account was proper research (because of the style of representation), and the verification criteria they wished to judge this research by appeared to be inappropriate. Whereas the use of autoethnographic methods may be increasing, knowledge of how to evaluate and provide feedback to improve such accounts appears to be lagging. As reviewers begin to develop ways in which to judge autoethnography, they must resist the temptation to &quot;seek universal foundational criteria lest one form of dogma simply replaces another&quot; (Sparkes, 2002b, p. 223). However, criteria for evaluating personal writing have barely begun to develop.

<text>Tachov (; ) is a town in the Plzeň Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 14,000 inhabitants. It lies on the Mže River. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==

Tachov consists of nine municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Tachov (11,888)
*Bíletín (19)
*Malý Rapotín (76)
*Mýto (48)
*Oldřichov (171)
*Světce (58)
*Velký Rapotín (73)
*Vilémov (16)
*Vítkov (161)
==Geography==
Tachov is located about west of Plzeň. The eastern and central parts of the municipal territory with the town proper lie in the Upper Palatine Forest Foothills. The western part lies in the Upper Palatinate Forest and includes the highest point of Tachov, the hill Světecký vrch at above sea level. The Mže River flows through the town.

==History==
The area was inhabited by humans around 8,000–6,000 BCE. The first written mention of Tachov is from 1126. King Ottokar II of Bohemia (1233–1278) built a new castle with a massive round stone tower there. He also founded a walled town near the castle.

During the Hussite Wars (1419–1434), the town was several times besieged and conquered. In 1427, Prokop the Great defeated the crusaders in the Battle of Tachov. The Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) damaged the town considerably. In 1664, Count Johann Anton Losy became the new proprietor. The Losy family began conversion of the medieval castle to a large baroque château. In 1784, the title passed to the Windisch-Graetz family. The Windisch-Graetzs, in their turn, rebuilt the house in the classical style at great expense.

Until 1918, Tachov – Tachau was part of Austria-Hungary, in the district of the same name, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

In 1938, it was occupied by the Nazi Germany and administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. Most of the German-speaking population was expelled in 1945 according to the Beneš decrees. The area was only partly repopulated, mostly by Czechs and Slovaks, but also by immigrants from Romania and Ukraine. Later on uranium was mined here, attracting laborers to work in the mines.

After the Velvet Revolution that ended the Communist era in 1989, the uranium mines were closed. Some German companies established factories in the area to make use of the cheap labour. However, the Tachov area is still among the economically least developed Czech regions.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Tachov is located on the Planá–Domažlice railway line of local importance.

==Sights==
===Castle and town fortifications===
Around 1300, the town fortifications were built around the town. They gradually became a pride of Tachov, because they belong to the best-preserved wall systems in the country. The medieval town was enclosed by an 8–10 m high and 150 cm thick circular wall. There were 26 towers around the perimeter of the walls, which reached a height of 11–14 m. To this day, 21 towers or their fragments have been preserved.

The Tachov Castle with a cylindrical tower was built during the reign of Ottokar II. In 1802 the tower was taken down, and the Windisch-Graetz family built a Renaissance castle instead. The construction was finished in 1808 and the Windisch-Graetzs lived here until 1939. During World War II, the castle was used for civil and military purposes, but it was seriously ruined, so in 1968 there was the possibility of demolition. Eventually, the castle was saved and from 1969 to 1983 it was under reconstruction. Today, part of the building is used as a primary art school and the rest is open to the public.

===Religious monuments===

The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mar was originally a Gothic church, but it went through many arrangements during the 14th century. The last reconstruction lasted from 1904 to 1908 and the church was rebuilt in Neo-Gothic style. The inside arrangements come from 1670. It does not have only the classical function of a church. Nowadays there are held many concerts during the year.

The church of Saint Wenceslaus is the oldest church in Tachov and may antedate the town itself. In 1802 the Windisch-Graetzs bought it and they made it a family tomb. It is a simple building located in park, which replaced a former churchyard. There are still many tombstones of significant burgesses, who lived in Tachov during the 15th–18th centuries. In 1947 the Czechoslovak Hussite Church took over this place.

The former Franciscan monastery and the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene were founded in 1466 and since this year both buildings went through many reconstructions. The Italian architect Martino Allio made the first reconstruction in 1686–1694, and the most important one came in years 1745–1750. In 1945 bombs damaged the church and four years later it was closed. Since 1945, the monastery has been used as the Museum of the Upper Palatinate Forest, and it offers information about the history of Tachov and the region surrounding it. The museum is used for many activities and many expositions are held here every year.

The Jewish cemetery, founded in 1615, is located in the southern part of the town. There are 190 gravestones here, and the oldest preserved one is from 1700.

===Světce===

Světce is a complex of three historical buildings. One of them is a monastery built in the 17th century. Josef II cancelled it and so in 1787 the Windisch-Graetzs bought it and rebuilt it as a castle. The castle that was finished in 1700 went down, and nowadays there are only remains of the walls and a small tower. The last one is a riding hall from the time of romanticism, which was built in 1830. It is the second largest riding hall in Central Europe, after the Viennese riding hall.

===Other===

Husmann&#x27;s Mill is a Baroque mill founded by the regent Jan Filip Husmann in 1645. During reconstruction in 2006–2007, a millwheel was restored. It is used by the Town Cultural Centre and the Tachov&#x27;s Children Choir.

Vysoká is a high hill to the west of the town. There is a high observation tower on its top and a monument that commemorates the Battle of Tachov.

Mohyla is a memorial that commemorates the death of 232 people, who were killed during the death marches during World War II.

<doc id="1303667" wikidata="Q1175967" url="?curid=1303667" title="David Onley">
<text>David Charles Onley (June 12, 1950 – January 14, 2023) was a Canadian broadcaster and writer who served as the 28th lieutenant governor of Ontario from 2007 until 2014.

Prior to his viceregal appointment, Onley was a television journalist. He worked primarily for Citytv as a weather reporter, before moving on to cover science and technology stories. Later on, he worked with the 24-hour news station CablePulse 24 as a news anchor and host of a weekly technology series, &quot;Home Page&quot;. A published author, he was the founding president of the Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada.

His seven-year term as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario makes him the province&#x27;s third longest-serving viceroy since Confederation, behind Albert Edward Matthews (1937–1946) and his successor Elizabeth Dowdeswell (2014–2023).

==Early life==
David Charles Onley was born in Midland, Ontario, on June 12, 1950. Beginning at the age of three, he battled with polio, resulting in partial paralysis. In order to facilitate medical treatment, the family moved to Scarborough (now part of Toronto), settling on Orchard Park Drive in the neighbourhood of West Hill. As a result of extensive physical therapy, he regained the use of his hands and arms, and partial use of his legs. Onley was able to get around using leg braces, canes, crutches, and his electric scooter. He was able to drive a car using hand controls.

He was educated at the University of Toronto Scarborough, served as student council president, and graduated in 1975 with an honours Bachelor of Arts degree and specialist certificate in political science. He then attended the University of Windsor Law School from 1976 to 1977, but did not complete the degree.

==Career==
Unable to find full-time employment after his graduation, Onley turned to writing, publishing &quot;Shuttle: A Shattering Novel of Disaster in Space&quot;, a bestselling novel about space travel, in 1981. It was nominated by the Periodical Distributors of Canada as book of the year in 1982.

While promoting the book, Onley positioned himself as a space program expert, leading to a career in radio. He began hosting a weekly science show for Toronto radio station CFRB, subsequently joining the CKO network in 1983. He then joined Citytv in 1984 as weather specialist, a position he held until 1989. In a 2004 interview with Link Up, a Toronto employment agency for people with disabilities, Onley stated that


From 1989 to 1995, he was the first news anchor on the then-new &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;, Citytv&#x27;s morning show. He served as education specialist for Citytv from 1994 to 1999. Onley became an anchor on Citytv&#x27;s sister station CP24 upon its launch in 1998, and both hosted and produced &quot;Home Page&quot; on CP24.

He was one of Canada&#x27;s first on-air television personalities with a visible disability; he used a mobility device due to his paralysis. Camera shots began with only upper body shots, but Onley demanded that the shot include him in his mobility device. In honour of his contributions to the advancement of disability issues in Canada, he has received awards from the Terry Fox Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Clarke Institute&#x27;s Courage to Come Back award. He was appointed Chair of the Accessibility Standards Advisory Council to the Minister of Community and Social Services in 2005. He was inducted into the Scarborough Walk of Fame in 2006.

Onley returned to his acting roots, with a cameo appearance in the sixth season of the Canadian TV series &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;. The episode, &quot;The Ghost of Queens Park&quot; aired in Canada on February 25, 2013. In it he played the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Sir Oliver Mowat. He also served as founding president of the Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada.

==As Lieutenant Governor==
Onley&#x27;s appointment as Lieutenant Governor was announced on July 10, 2007; he was privately informed of this after a July 4, 2007, taping of &quot;Home Page&quot;: &quot;I just had reached the top of the Don Valley Parkway... and there was no place to pull over. And when the Prime Minister of your country calls, all you can try to do is stay in the same lane, avoid any fender-benders and have a meaningful conversation, which I did.&quot;

He was sworn in on September 5, 2007, at Queen&#x27;s Park in Toronto. As the province&#x27;s first Lieutenant Governor with a disability, Onley said he would use his vice-regal position to help remove physical barriers to Ontario&#x27;s 1.5 million people with disabilities, as well as focus on other issues affecting disabled people, including obstacles to employment and housing. Onley also stated, in his installation speech, that he would expand on his immediate predecessor James Bartleman&#x27;s First Nations literacy initiatives, his aim being to see computers on every student&#x27;s desk in northern schools. For his installation, Onley approached the legislature on his electric scooter, however he ascended the Throne on foot, using leg braces and canes.

During Onley&#x27;s mandate, he participated in 2550 engagements, during which he spoke to an estimated audience of over one million people. He travelled to China to represent the Queen and Canada at the 2008 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony. Onley delivered his last speech from the throne to the Ontario Legislative Assembly on July 3, 2014; his last full day in office was September 22, 2014, with his successor sworn in the following afternoon.

Onley and his wife resided in their Scarborough home during his vice-regal tenure, as Ontario is one of three provinces that does not have an official vice-regal residence.

==Post-viceregal life==
Onley was appointed senior lecturer in the Department of Political Sciences at University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC), his alma mater. His appointment began on October 1, 2014. At UTSC he also served as special
advisor on disability issues, encouraging the development of new initiatives including the founding of the Centre for Global Disability Studies. He also served as the university&#x27;s special ambassador for the 2015 Pan American and Parapan American Games.

In 2018, Onley was appointed to review the act and conducted public consultations on the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). Onley conducted extensive consultations, and delivered a written Legislative Review of the AODA in 2019, available online. In the report, Onley raises concerns that based on consultations with disabled citizens and their family members, the province is not on track to meet 2025 AODA goals. The report offers concrete recommendations for improved implementation of the AODA, including calls to address the intersection of disability and poverty, and the need to take an &quot;all-of-government approach by making accessibility the responsibility of every ministry&quot; and clarify the relationship of the AODA to the Ontario Human Rights Code.

==Personal life and death==
Onley was married to Ruth Ann, a Christian music performer. They have three sons, Jonathan, Robert and Michael. In late 2019, Onley received emergency medical treatment after a brain scan revealed that he had a tumour the size of an orange at the front of his brain, which was successfully removed.

Onley died at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto on January 14, 2023, aged 72. He is survived by his wife and three children. He was accorded an Ontario state funeral; following two days of lying in state at the Ontario Legislative Building, his funeral was held on January 30 at Yorkminster Park Baptist Church. Those in attendance included his successor Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Dowdeswell and Ontario Premier Doug Ford.

<text>Wong Ka Kui (; 10 June 1962 – 30 June 1993) was a Hong Kong musician, singer and songwriter and the leader and co-founder of the rock band Beyond, where he was the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and primary songwriter. His younger brother Wong Ka Keung was the band&#x27;s bass guitarist. Wong Ka Kui created hundreds of songs in his short life and was considered one of the iconic figures of Chinese rock music.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Wong grew up in So Uk Estate, Sham Shui Po.

When he was a junior in secondary school, he was introduced to European and American music by a schoolmate. It was then that he became a big fan of David Bowie, Pink Floyd and John Lennon, and later helped popularize them in Hong Kong. Until the age of 15, he taught himself to play guitar on an acoustic guitar which was pre-owned by a neighbor. Thereafter he bought a second-hand electric guitar, a red maplewood Fender Stratocaster.

He was once bullied by a bandmate due to his poor guitar playing.

He once worked as an office assistant, mechanic, and scenery decorator for a TV company after his graduation from secondary school. Wong was also a salesman in the same insurance company of drummer Yip Sai Wing.

=== Formation of Beyond ===
In 1981, Wong met drummer Yip Sai Wing through the boss from a piano company, and later teamed up with William Tang (鄧煒謙) on lead guitar and bassist Lee Wing Chiu (李榮潮). In 1983, the band entered a contest by &quot;Guitar Magazine&quot; under the band name &quot;Beyond&quot;, created by Tang who made a vow to transcend themselves in pursuit of attainment. The band thereafter added Wong Ka Keung on bass in 1984 and Paul Wong on lead guitar in 1985. After that they held their first and only self-funded concert &quot;Waiting Forever&quot; (永遠等待演唱會) (1985).

In 1986 Lau Chi Yuen (劉志遠) joined the band as lead guitarist and keyboardist to record the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Goodbye Ideals&quot; (再見理想) (1986) and EP &quot;Waiting Forever&quot; (永遠等待) (1986) without the assistance of outside record company. Until under the assistance of KINN&#x27;s MUSIC LTD, operated by manager Leslie Chan (陳健添), Beyond&#x27;s images and music became more accepted publicly. Beyond released the album &quot;Arabian Dancing Girls&quot; (亞拉伯跳舞女郎) (1987) and &quot;Modern Stage&quot; (現代舞台) (1988).

=== 1988–1991: First success, Cinepoly Records and social concerns ===
In 1988, Beyond signed Cinepoly&#x27;s contract with proprietor Chan Siu Po (陳少寶) and made the album &quot;Secret Police&quot; (秘密警察) (1988). They won awards in Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation by a hit from this album &quot;The Grand Earth (大地)&quot;. In 1989, the band won awards by the song &quot;Truly Love You&quot; (真的愛你) from the album &quot;Beyond IV&quot; (1989) in Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation and both RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards.

In 1990, Beyond won awards by the song &quot;Glorious Years (光輝歲月)&quot; from the album &quot;Destiny Party&quot; (命運派對) (1990) in Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation. Wong also won &quot;the Best Lyrics Award&quot; individually rather than with the band.

From 1990 to 1991, Beyond paid more attention to the social issues and ongoing events around the world. The music and lyrics in the song &quot;Glorious Years&quot; (光輝歲月) was created during Wong&#x27;s visit to New Guinea in 1990 and it is a tribute to former South-African president Nelson Mandela. In 1991, the band visited Kenya and witnessed the grinding poverty and misery there. Wong was again enlightened to write music and lyrics in the song &quot;Amani&quot; from the album &quot;Hesitation&quot; (猶豫). &quot;Amani&quot; means &quot;peace&quot; in Swahili and this song also included lyrics in Swahili, calling for peace and love. Upon their return, a number of songs were written addressing the serious problems of Africa. The Beyond Third World Foundation was created in the same year with profits from the redistribution of an early album.

=== Career in Japan ===
In the 1990s, Wong began to feel limited by the Hong Kong music industry; he once said that &quot;there&#x27;s only the entertainment industry but not a music industry in Hong Kong.&quot; Beyond thus decided to focus on their career in Japan. In January 1992, the band signed a worldwide management contract with Japanese record label Amuse. During the year, they released an album called &quot;Continue the Revolution&quot; (繼續革命). In May 1993, Beyond returned to Hong Kong with a new album &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (樂與怒). Wong&#x27;s signature work &quot;Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies&quot; (海闊天空) won the Best Original Song award in Hong Kong. Before they went back to Japan, Beyond held unplugged live concerts in Hong Kong and Malaysia, which were Beyond&#x27;s last concert with Wong Ka Kui.

== Death ==
Beyond arrived in Japan in January 1993 to record new material and engage in media appearances. On 24 June 1993, the band appeared at a Tokyo Fuji Television game show called &quot;If Uchannan-chan is Going to Do It, We Have to Do It!&quot; . Fifteen minutes after the show commenced, an accident occurred. The stage floor was very narrow and slippery, and both Wong and host Teruyoshi Uchimura slipped and fell 2.7 meters off the platform, live on air. Wong landed head first to the ground and immediately slipped into a coma when Uchimura landed on Wong&#x27;s chest. Uchimura received no serious injury, while Wong was rushed to the hospital. Given the extreme level of trauma, doctors did not immediately perform any medical operations out of an abundance of caution.

On 26 June, several music fans of Beyond gathered at the carpark lot of the Commercial Radio Hong Kong Station to pray for him. The next day, as doctors declared the case hopeless, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner arrived to treat Wong, who showed slight improvement afterwards. Six days later, on 30 June 1993, at 16:15 at the Tokyo Women&#x27;s Medical University Hospital, a Japanese representative announced Wong&#x27;s death in a press conference.

Wong&#x27;s body was transported to Hong Kong on 3 July, with hundreds of people awaiting its arrival at Kai Tak Airport. His funeral procession took place two days later, bringing various major streets in Hong Kong to a standstill. Thousands of celebrities and fans attended his funeral service. Wong was buried in Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery, with his Martin D-28 acoustic guitar. His tombstone is made of white marble and bears the image of a guitar. Every year on his birthday and the anniversary of his passing, fans gather at his tomb to pay their respects.

== Legacy ==
The song &quot;Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies&quot; was written by Wong in 1993 and has been an anthem of Cantonese rock music and one of Beyond&#x27;s signature songs. On 12 April 2022, it became the first Cantonese song that reach 100 million views on YouTube. 

During a concert of Beyond in 2003, Wong was resurrected in the form of a life-size video projection, alongside the remaining band members while they sang the song &quot;Combat for Twenty Years&quot; (抗戰二十年) in memory of him 10 years after his death.

On 8 November 2005, Hong Kong post office released a stamp collection called &quot;Hong Kong Pop Singers&quot;. Wong was one of the five singers who had their images printed on stamps.

In a vote conducted by Sina China in 2007, Wong was one of the Most Missed Celebrities along with Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui. Many tribute songs have been written and dedicated to him, including &quot;The Champion of Love&quot; by the rock band Bakufu-Slump, &quot;Him&quot; by the rock band Soler, &quot;Wish You Well&quot; by his brother Wong Ka Keung, &quot;Paradise&quot; by Beyond, &quot;Combat for twenty years&quot; by Beyond and &quot;The Story&quot; by Paul Wong.

In December 2007, Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) released a documentary series called &quot;A Legend Never Dies&quot;, featuring Roman Tam, Anita Mui, Leslie Cheung, Teresa Teng, Wong Ka Kui and Danny Chan. The episode of Wong aired on TVB on 26 January 2008. The episode is entitled: Wong Ka Kui &quot;The Spring Water of Hong Kong Music Industry.&quot;

The Asteroid 41742 Wongkakui was named in his memory on 29 May 2018.

<doc id="1303671" wikidata="Q7337068" url="?curid=1303671" title="River Allen, Dorset">
<text>The River Allen is a river in Dorset in South West England. It flows for to its confluence with the River Stour at Wimborne Minster. It has two main tributaries, the Gussage Stream and the Crichel Stream.

==Route==
The River Allen starts as a winterbourne at Wyke Farm in Monkton Up Wimborne, on the chalk downland of Cranborne Chase. It flows roughly southwards on the dip slope of the downland through Wimborne St Giles, and is joined by the Gussage stream at Gussage All Saints and the Crichel stream south of Moor Crichel, before passing through Witchampton and Hinton Parva, where the landscape transitions from chalk downland to broad valley. Finally, at Wimborne Minster, it flows into the Stour immediately south the town beside the old Canford Bridge across the Stour to Oakley. The river is known as a classic chalk stream which supports a good fishery for trout and used to support a good salmonid population. Much of the riverbank is privately owned by two estates, including the Shaftesbury Estate at the source. There are 

==Watermills==
There have been a number of corn mills on the river. Loverley Mill at Crichel survives as a Grade II listed building. Originally there were two waterwheels but they were replaced in the early 20th century by a water turbine driving a pump to supply water to Crichel House. Other mills were Hinton Farm Mill, Stanbridge Mill and Didlington Mill.

==Environment==

Since 1946, the water from the Allen has been abstracted for domestic and industrial use. The amount of water taken was having a detrimental effect on the river flow whilst at the same time the salmonid population dropped significantly. Studies have been undertaken into a correlation between the two events and resulted in the abstraction rate being reduced by 50%. Over the last twenty years there has been an increase in arable farming (wheat, barley, oats oilseed rape and peas) as well as some watercress farming discharge reaching the river. The Allen is one of several rivers that are subject to a major restoration project led by Dorset Wildlife Trust with funding from Wessex Water and Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The Allen had the strongest population of white clawed crayfish in Dorset, and measures such as tree planting and slowing the flow of the river were implemented to help the species. However, an outbreak of Crayfish plague was discovered on the river in 2014, with at least 100 of the native species found dead in the river. The river also has an abundance of macrophytes including the two most abundant taxa: common water-crowfoot (&quot;Ranunculus aquatilis&quot;) and bur-reeds (&quot;Sparganium&quot;). As well as an abundance of brown trout the river is home to minnow, dace, grayling, salmon, perch, roach, pike, bullhead and brook lamprey and the critically endangered European eel.

===Water quality===
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

<text>Samuel Eto&#x27;o Fils (; born 10 March 1981) is a Cameroonian football administrator and former player who is the current president of the Cameroonian Football Federation. He is often regarded as one of the greatest strikers of his generation alongside being one of the greatest African players of all time. 

A precocious talent, Eto&#x27;o moved to Real Madrid as a 16 year old. Due to competition in his position with more experienced players, he had several loan spells, before signing for Mallorca in 2000 where he scored 70 goals, a club record. His impressive form saw him join Barcelona in 2004 where he scored 130 goals in five seasons and also became the record holder for the most appearances by an African player in La Liga. Winning La Liga three times, he was a key member of the Barcelona attack, alongside Ronaldinho, that won the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final, with Eto&#x27;o scoring in the final, and was part of a front three of Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry that won the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final, with Eto&#x27;o again scoring in the final. He is the second player in history to score in two UEFA Champions League finals. At Barcelona, Eto&#x27;o came in third for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2005 and was twice named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI, in 2005 and 2006.

He signed with Inter Milan for the 2009–10 season, where he became the first player to win two European continental trebles following his back-to-back achievements with Barcelona and Inter. He is the fourth player in Champions League history, after Marcel Desailly, Paulo Sousa, and Gerard Piqué, to have won the trophy two years in a row with different teams. After brief spells with Anzhi Makhachkala, Chelsea, Everton, and Sampdoria, Eto&#x27;o found prolific form again in the Süper Lig with Antalyaspor having scored 44 goals in 76 league games. In 2015, he received the Golden Foot Award.

He won the African Player of the Year a record four times, winning in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2010. As a member of the Cameroon national team, Eto&#x27;o was a part of the squad that won the Gold Medal at the 2000 Olympics. He also won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2000 and 2002. Eto&#x27;o has participated in four World Cups and six Africa Cup of Nations. He is the all-time leading scorer in the history of the Africa Cup of Nations, with 18 goals, and is Cameroon&#x27;s all-time leading scorer and third most capped player, with 56 goals in 118 caps. Eto&#x27;o announced his retirement from international football in August 2014.

==Club career==
===Real Madrid===
Having trained at the Kadji Sports Academy in Cameroon, Eto&#x27;o joined Real Madrid&#x27;s youth academy in 1997, but he could only train with Real Madrid B, as he was still a minor. Real Madrid B were relegated to the third tier, Segunda División B, where non-EU players are not allowed, and as a result, he was loaned to second division Leganés for the 1997–98 season. After making 30 appearances for the club and only scoring four goals, he returned to Madrid following the end of the 1998–99 season. In January 1999, he was loaned out to Espanyol, but made only one appearance for the club, against Real Valladolid in Copa del Rey.

===Mallorca===
The next season, in the winter transfer window, he transferred to La Liga team Mallorca on loan, where he scored six goals in 19 games. At the end of the season, Eto&#x27;o left Real Madrid, signing a permanent deal with Mallorca for a club record £4.4 million fee. In his second season, he scored 11 goals and began to garner attention throughout the league. Mallorca President Mateo Alemany said of his style of play, &quot;I doubt if there is any other player in the world who would please the fans more at this moment.&quot; Eto&#x27;o himself commented on his rise to stardom, &quot;I like it here in Mallorca; I have always been well looked after, the fans appreciate me and I also have a contract that runs until 2007.&quot; He returned the fans&#x27; appreciation when he donated €30,000 in meals to travelling Mallorca supporters who made the journey to the Copa del Rey final against Recreativo de Huelva in 2003. Mallorca won the match 3–0, with Eto&#x27;o scoring two late goals to seal the victory. Eto&#x27;o also scored in two consecutive away wins against his former club Real Madrid: the first, a 1-5 thrashing, the only home loss of the Madrilenian club who went to win the 2002-03 La Liga.; the second ended with a 2-3 result that denied a back-to-back La Liga win for Real.

===Barcelona===
====2004–07: Transfer, Pichichi Trophy and first Champions League title====

Eto&#x27;o departed Mallorca as the club&#x27;s all-time leading domestic league scorer (54 goals) when he signed for Barcelona in the summer of 2004 for a transfer fee of €24 million, after lengthy, three-way negotiations with Mallorca and Madrid. Initially, Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez wanted to buy back the full transfer rights and loan him out again, but eventually the Barcelona deal proved lucrative enough to warrant a sale. Additionally, the team already had its full quota of three non-EU players.

Eto&#x27;o made his Barcelona debut in the season opener at Racing de Santander on 29 August 2004. After Barcelona won the 2004–05 La Liga title, the team organized a festive party in the Camp Nou, during which Eto&#x27;o harangued the fans chanting, &quot;Madrid, cabrón, saluda al campeón&quot; (English for, &quot;Madrid, bastards, salute the champions&quot;). The Royal Spanish Football Federation fined Eto&#x27;o €12,000 for his comments, for which he later apologized. He expressed regret and asked for forgiveness from Real Madrid, his first professional team. The head of the Real Madrid fan club federation remained unimpressed, however, stating, &quot;This character is a fantastic player, but he leaves a lot to be desired as a person.&quot; He signed an improved contract with Barcelona in June 2005.

After missing out on the previous year&#x27;s Pichichi trophy, which is given to the top scorer in La Liga, Eto&#x27;o edged out Valencia striker David Villa for the award during the final matchday on 20 May 2006 when he scored his 26th goal of the season against Athletic Bilbao. Eto&#x27;o was very gracious to teammates after the game, saying, &quot;It has been a team effort although only one person gets the award. We&#x27;ve worked hard all season and have got our just rewards.&quot;

Eto&#x27;o also contributed six goals during Barcelona&#x27;s run to the 2005–06 Champions League title. In the final, Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off early on for bringing down Eto&#x27;o just outside the penalty area, but the Catalans struggled to capitalize on their one-man advantage until Eto&#x27;o scored the game-tying goal in the second half. Barcelona went on to win the match 2–1, and Eto&#x27;o was awarded with the UEFA Best Forward of the Year award for his accomplishments in the European campaign.

Eto&#x27;o also won an historic third consecutive African Player of the Year award that season. He said in his acceptance speech, &quot;Above all, I dedicate this to all the children of Africa.&quot; He was also selected to his second straight FIFPro World XI and finished third in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year, making him only the second African footballer ever, after the Liberian star George Weah, to be voted into the top three.

The season started badly for Eto&#x27;o, as he ruptured the meniscus in his right knee during Barcelona&#x27;s Champions League group stage match against Werder Bremen on 27 September 2006. Barcelona team physician Ricard Pruna originally estimated that the injury would keep him out of action for two to three months. After the operation, Eto&#x27;o&#x27;s recovery time was extended to five months, but he resumed training with Barcelona in early January 2007.

====2007–09: More trophies, the &quot;Treble&quot; and departure====

Eto&#x27;o refused to come on as a substitute in a league match against Racing de Santander on 11 February 2007. Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard said after the match, &quot;He did not want to come on; I don&#x27;t know why.&quot; Ronaldinho was critical of Eto&#x27;o&#x27;s actions, saying that Eto&#x27;o was not putting the team first, but Eto&#x27;o rebutted the comment, claiming that he did not come on because he did not have enough time to warm up properly. Three months later, Eto&#x27;o said, &quot;These kind of things are usually just speculation and don&#x27;t come through to me. However, if it is true that I am a problem for my team then I will go. But like I said, I am happy here. The press can write what they want.&quot; Following the comments, Barcelona President Joan Laporta was quick to quash rumours of transfers involving Eto&#x27;o and Ronaldinho.

After aggravating a meniscus injury on 28 August during a summer friendly against Inter Milan, Eto&#x27;o was sidelined indefinitely. On 17 October, in the midst of his recovery period, he gained Spanish citizenship. He was cleared to play again on 4 December, and returned to the side a week later in Barcelona&#x27;s 2–1 league win over Deportivo de La Coruña.

Pep Guardiola was appointed as Barcelona&#x27;s new manager for the 2008–09 season. The coach made headlines by announcing that stars such as Ronaldinho, Deco, and Eto&#x27;o were not part of his plans; Eto&#x27;o ultimately remained with the club, while the other two players departed, although Eto&#x27;o and Guardiola had several reported disagreements throughout the season. Eto&#x27;o recorded his first league hat-trick in a match against Levante on 24 February 2008. He finished with a total of 16 league goals in 18 appearances for the season. 

On 25 October, Eto&#x27;o recorded the fastest hat-trick in club history after netting three times in 23 minutes in a victory over Almería. Only two games later, on 8 November 2008, Eto&#x27;o scored four goals in the first half of Barcelona&#x27;s game against Real Valladolid, which ended 6–0. On 29 November 2008, he scored his 111th career Barcelona goal in all competitions in a 3–0 road win over Sevilla, moving him into the club&#x27;s top ten all-time goalscorers.

On 14 February 2009, he scored his 99th and his 100th league goals for Barcelona in a 2–2 draw with Real Betis. Eto&#x27;o scored his 30th goal of the 2008–09 season in a La Liga match against Real Valladolid. The game ended 1–0 and meant that Barcelona kept a six-point lead over Real Madrid in the league. He also scored against Villarreal in the game that put Barcelona one point away from lifting the 2008–09 La Liga trophy. He scored 30 goals in the season, finishing second in the Pichichi Trophy goalscorers list behind Atlético de Madrid&#x27;s Diego Forlán.

Eto&#x27;o scored the opening goal in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United. Barcelona went on to win the final 2–0, thus completing the Treble. The trio of Lionel Messi (38 goals), Eto&#x27;o (36 goals) and Thierry Henry (26 goals) scored exactly 100 goals between them in the club&#x27;s historic treble year.

===Inter Milan===
====2009–10: Historical treble-winning campaign====

After Maxwell completed the transfer from Inter Milan, Joan Laporta confirmed that there was an agreement in principle between Barcelona and Inter Milan for Zlatan Ibrahimović to join the club in exchange for Eto&#x27;o and €46 million. After Ibrahimović agreed terms with Barcelona, the club announced Eto&#x27;o would travel to Milan for his medical to complete the transfer.

On 27 July 2009, Eto&#x27;o passed his medical and signed for five years with Inter. On his first press-conference in Milan, he declared that he was where he wanted to be and refused to compare himself to Ibrahimović saying, &quot;I&#x27;m Samuel Eto&#x27;o and I don&#x27;t want to compare myself to anyone. I believe the victories I have earned up to now can contribute to giving the right value to my name.&quot; On 8 August, Eto&#x27;o
scored on his competitive debut in the 2009 Supercoppa Italiana as Inter lost 1–2 to Lazio. Two weeks later, Eto&#x27;o scored from the penalty spot against Bari in his first Serie A match. In the following match, the Derby della Madonnina against Milan, Eto&#x27;o won Inter a penalty after being brought down by Gennaro Gattuso in the box; Milito scored the penalty and Gattuso was yellow carded and eventually sent off. Inter won the match 4–0. Eto&#x27;o scored again on 13 September against Parma, his first goal from open play in a Serie A match.

At the end of September 2009, Eto&#x27;o demanded almost £2.75 million from Barcelona after his transfer to Inter. The amount represented 15% of the £17.7 million (US$29 million) fee which Inter paid Barcelona in July 2009. The demand was based on a Spanish rule that a player should get 15% of the amount of his transfer to another Spanish club. If the parties failed to reach a solution, the matter could go to court.
Eto&#x27;o scored his first Serie A brace on 29 October during a 5–3 win over Palermo, with Mario Balotelli also scoring twice. On 1 December 2009, Eto&#x27;o finished fifth in voting for the Ballon d&#x27;Or, which was won by his former Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi. Eight days later, he scored his first UEFA Champions League goal for the team in the final Group F match against Rubin Kazan to help Inter win 2–0 at home and progress to the knockout stage as runner-ups. Eto&#x27;o continued to be a protagonist for Inter in Europe, netting the winner in the second leg of 2009–10 UEFA Champions League round of 16 against Chelsea on 16 March 2010, which allowed Inter to progress to the quarter-finals. He scored his first goal in Coppa Italia on 13 April against Fiorentina in the second of semi-finals to help Inter win 1–0 at Stadio Artemio Franchi and progress in the final 2–0 on aggregate. Eto&#x27;o won his first silverware with the club on 5 May as Inter defeated Roma 1–0 at Stadio Olimpico to lift the Coppa Italia. His 12 Serie A goals helped Inter claim another championship, the fifth consecutive, after defeating Siena in the final matchday. On 22 May 2010, Eto&#x27;o played in the third Champions League final of his career, as Inter won 2–0 over Bayern Munich to win the first title in 45 years; Milito scored both goals, with Eto&#x27;o setting up the second. With Inter&#x27;s triumph over Bayern Munich, he became the only player to win the treble in consecutive seasons with two different teams.

====2010–11: Most goals in one season, more trophies and departure====
On 21 August 2010, Eto&#x27;o scored twice as Inter beat Roma 3–1 to win the Supercoppa Italiana. His first hat trick for Inter occurred in the UEFA Champions League against Werder Bremen on 29 September 2010. Inter won the game 4–0, with Eto&#x27;o saying, &quot;We will remain humble because we know that there are sides out there that are better than us, so we will just take it one match at a time and we will go as far as it takes us.&quot; In December, Eto&#x27;o played in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup; he scored against TP Mazembe in the final as Inter won 3–0 and lifted their fifth trophy of the year. Additionally, he was named the best player of the tournament.

Continuing his outstanding form in Serie A and in the Champions League for the 2010–11 campaign, he was pivotal to Inter&#x27;s attack line. On 16 March 2011, Eto&#x27;o gave a legendary performance in Munich as he helped Inter eliminate Bayern Munich 3–2 (with an aggregate score of 3–3, winning on away goals) in the Champions League. Eto&#x27;o scored the first goal after four minutes, and provided two clinical assists to Wesley Sneijder and to Goran Pandev for the winner. After the game, Inter President Massimo Moratti said, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure if the deal that brought Eto&#x27;o to the club was my best piece of transfer business ever, but I really think it was a great piece of business for us. Eto&#x27;o is fantastic. I do not want to take anything away from Ibrahimović, but for everyone it was really a great deal to get Eto&#x27;o. Samuel is truly extraordinary.&quot; On 29 May, Eto&#x27;o scored two goals in the final of the Coppa Italia against Palermo to help Inter win 3–1 and taking his total season goals to 37, a new record high for him.

On 25 August 2011, Eto&#x27;o announced his departure from Inter Milan via an open letter to the fans.

===Anzhi Makhachkala===

On 23 August 2011, Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala reached an agreement with Inter to sign Eto&#x27;o in a three-year deal that made him the world&#x27;s highest-paid player, with a salary of €20 million (after taxes) per season. Eto&#x27;o made his debut for Anzhi on 27 August 2011 against Rostov when he came on as a substitute with 30 minutes left in the game, later scoring an equalizer in the 80th minute from a cross by Yuri Zhirkov. Eto&#x27;o scored the opening goal in a 5–3 defeat at home to CSKA Moscow leaving his side four points above Krasnodar with only two games left for qualification to the Championship Group.

At the end of the 2012–13 Russian Premier League, Eto&#x27;o made it to the Top 33 players of the Season list as the #1 Right Striker. Anzhi&#x27;s billionaire owner Suleyman Kerimov shocked the Russian football world by deciding in August 2013 to scale down the club&#x27;s ambitions and drastically shrink its budget. As a result, almost all of the star players, previously signed in a bid to make the club world-beaters, were available on the transfer market.

===Chelsea===

On 29 August 2013, Eto&#x27;o signed a one-year deal with English Premier League club Chelsea for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal for Chelsea on 19 October 2013 against Cardiff City, in which he gave Chelsea the lead. In Chelsea&#x27;s home Champions League match against Schalke 04 on 6 November, Eto&#x27;o scored twice in a 3–0 victory. In Eto&#x27;o&#x27;s first league start of 2014, on 19 January, he scored his first Premier League hat-trick for Chelsea, earning the Blues a 3–1 victory over Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. On 8 March, Eto&#x27;o opened scoring in Chelsea&#x27;s 4–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur when defender Jan Vertonghen sent a backpass straight into his path. It was the 300th goal in his club career.

In the second leg of Chelsea&#x27;s Champions League round of 16 tie with Galatasaray, Eto&#x27;o gave the Blues a fourth-minute early lead with his tenth goal of the season, a match they would go on to win 2–0. Eto&#x27;o continued his good form after scoring another early goal, in the fifth minute, against Arsenal on 22 March. However, he was then substituted after ten minutes for Fernando Torres after picking up a slight injury; Chelsea went on to win the match 6–0.

===Everton===
Eto&#x27;o&#x27;s contract with Chelsea expired at the end of the 2013–14 season, and on 26 August 2014, he joined fellow English Premier League side Everton, signing a two-year contract. He made his debut four days later, scoring one goal with a header in a 3–6 home defeat to Chelsea. On 26 October, Eto&#x27;o bagged a brace for Everton, heading in the opening goal and curling in a strike from outside the area, as the Toffees defeated Burnley 3−1.

He stated that he wanted to win the UEFA Europa League with Everton, a tournament which he had never won before. However, Eto&#x27;o left halfway through his first season at Everton, having scored four goals in 20 games across all competitions for them.

===Later career and retirement===
On 27 January 2015, Eto&#x27;o returned to the Italian Serie A, joining Sampdoria on a two-and-a-half-year deal.

On 25 June 2015, Eto&#x27;o moved to Turkish side Antalyaspor on a three-year contract. He made his debut on 15 August 2015 in a league match against İstanbul Başakşehir, scoring two goals and helping Antalyaspor win 3–2. Eto&#x27;o had a blistering start to the season, scoring 13 goals in his first 15 games, and was named the interim player-manager for the team after the previous coach, Yusuf Şimşek, was sacked on 7 December. He continued in this capacity until José Morais was hired as Şimşek&#x27;s permanent replacement on 6 January 2016.

On 31 January 2018, after leaving Antalyaspor by mutual consent, Eto&#x27;o joined league rivals Konyaspor on a two-and-a-half-year contract.

He signed for Qatar SC in August 2018. In February 2019 he said he wished to continue playing for a further year.

On 7 September 2019, Eto&#x27;o announced his retirement from football.

==International career==

Eto&#x27;o earned his first cap with Cameroon one day before his 16th birthday on 9 March 1997, in a 5–0 friendly loss to Costa Rica. In 1998, he was the youngest participant in the 1998 FIFA World Cup when he appeared in a 3–0 group stage loss to Italy on 17 June 1998, at the age of 17 years and three months. Eto&#x27;o scored his sole goal of the 2002 FIFA World Cup when he netted the game-winner against Saudi Arabia during the group stage on 6 June 2002, which was Cameroon&#x27;s only win of the competition.

Eto&#x27;o was a part of the squads that won the 2000 and 2002 Africa Cup of Nations, and was a gold medalist at the 2000 Summer Olympics. At the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which Cameroon finished as runners-up, he scored his only goal in a 1–0 group stage upset of Brazil on 19 June. Cameroon were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations after Eto&#x27;o missed the decisive penalty in a 12–11 penalty shootout loss to Ivory Coast following a 1–1 draw, but he nonetheless finished as the top scorer of the tournament with five goals. He missed a team practice before the quarter-finals to attend the CAF African Footballer of the Year award ceremonies in Togo.

In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, Eto&#x27;o became joint leading goalscorer (along with Laurent Pokou) in the competition&#x27;s history after scoring his 14th goal with a penalty against Zambia on 26 January 2008. In the following game against Sudan, on 30 January, Eto&#x27;o converted another penalty to become the tournament&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, followed by another goal in the same match that took his Cup of Nations tally to 16. He finished as the top scorer for the second consecutive tournament, matching his 2006 total of five goals.

On 1 June 2008, Eto&#x27;o headbutted reporter Philippe Bony following an incident at a press conference. Bony suffered an injury, but Eto&#x27;o later apologized for the altercation, offering to pay Bony&#x27;s medical expenses. In the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Gabon, Eto&#x27;o scored a goal in the 68th minute. He followed it up with another goal in the home fixture. He led the scoring chart with eight qualification goals. Eto&#x27;o scored in the World Cup qualification match against Morocco to win Cameroon a spot in the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament. On 19 June 2010, Eto&#x27;o scored a goal in Cameroon&#x27;s 2010 World Cup group stage match against Denmark, from a mistake by Christian Poulsen. Cameroon eventually lost the game 2–1 and was eliminated from the World Cup. Eto&#x27;o described it as the biggest disappointment of his career. In December 2010, Eto&#x27;o became the first man to be named African Player of the Year for a fourth time.

On 16 December 2011, Eto&#x27;o was suspended 15 games by the Cameroonian Football Federation, after the team refused to play a friendly against Algeria earlier in the year. The ban was reduced to eight months in January 2012, meaning Eto&#x27;o would only miss four competitive matches. The change was brought about after Cameroon President Paul Biya asked officials to reconsider the controversial sanction.

On 27 August 2012, Eto&#x27;o was in the squad to face Cape Verde in the first leg of a qualification play-off for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, but the striker refused to play, as a protest against what he described as the &quot;amateurish and poorly organised&quot; national team set-up. After an intervention from Cameroon Prime Minister Philemon Yang, Eto&#x27;o agreed to return for the second leg. However, Eto&#x27;o&#x27;s return was not enough for Cameroon to overturn a 0–2 first leg deficit, and the &quot;Indomitable Lions&quot; failed to qualify for the Cup of Nations.

On 23 March 2013, Eto&#x27;o scored his first goal for Cameroon in 16 months with a penalty kick against Togo in a 2014 World Cup qualifier. He went on to score an 82nd minute winning goal in the same match, sending Cameroon to the top of their qualifying group. In November 2013, he captained the team in their 4–1 aggregate defeat of Tunisia in the play-off to secure World Cup qualification. In June 2014, Eto&#x27;o was selected in Cameroon&#x27;s squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, becoming the third African to participate in four tournaments after compatriots Jacques Songo&#x27;o and Rigobert Song. After joining Everton, on 27 August 2014, Eto&#x27;o announced his retirement from international competition.

==Style of play==

Eto&#x27;o was a fast, strong, and energetic forward, who was known for his stamina, work-rate, ability in the air, and his accurate finishing ability both with his head and feet. A powerful and prolific goalscorer with good technique, composure in front of goal, and an ability to play off other forwards, Eto&#x27;o was primarily deployed as a central striker, although he was also a team player; indeed, during his time at Inter, under José Mourinho, he demonstrated notable tactical intelligence and versatility by playing in several other positions on the pitch. During Inter&#x27;s 2009–10 treble-winning season, Eto&#x27;o played an important role in the squad, and was utilised as a winger or even as an attacking midfielder on the left flank in Mourinho&#x27;s 4–2–3–1 formation, where he was primarily required to help his team creatively and defensively with his link-up play and work-rate off the ball, which frequently saw him to track back. During the return leg of the Champions League semi-final match against his former club Barcelona, Eto&#x27;o further demonstrated his work-rate and versatility by playing as a makeshift right-sided attacking full-back or wing-back following Thiago Motta&#x27;s controversial sending-off. Eto&#x27;o has also been renowned for his leadership, opportunism and mentality throughout his career.

In his prime, Eto&#x27;o was regarded by pundits as one of the best strikers in the world; he is currently regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time. He is often ranked among the three greatest African strikers, alongside George Weah and Didier Drogba. Despite losing some of his speed with age, he continued to maintain a consistent goalscoring rate as a striker, due to his ability to get into good positions and time his attacking runs, as shown by his goal in a 6–3 loss against Chelsea on 30 August 2014, during his time with Everton. Beyond his speed and goalscoring, Eto&#x27;o was also known for his first touch, close control, and passing ability in his prime; even in his advancing age, he maintained his dribbling skills in his later career, which he used to his advantage to beat defenders and assist or create chances for teammates. In his mid-thirties Eto&#x27;o incorporated an ‘old man’ routine in his goal celebration – a response to jibes by José Mourinho about being too old – where he bent over and started walking slowly with an imaginary cane, with the celebration featuring in EA Sports’ &quot;FIFA&quot; video game &quot;FIFA 18&quot;.

== President of Cameroon Football Federation (FECAFOOT) ==
On 11 December 2021, Eto&#x27;o was elected President of the Cameroonian Football Federation (FECAFOOT). In September 2024 he received a six month ban from attending Cameroon international games due to breaching the world governing body’s disciplinary code. This came after charges were filed against him following an incident at a 2024 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup match in Colombia between Brazil and Cameroon.

== World Cup 2022 ambassador ==
Eto&#x27;o was appointed Ambassador of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

After the Brazil-South Korea match, he was filmed kneeing a man in the face after a confrontation. News reporters were unable to identify the man or reason behind the attack, which did not appear to cause any serious injury.

==Personal life==
Eto&#x27;o is a native of Nkon, a suburb of Yaoundé. He has two brothers who are also footballers: David and Étienne. Eto&#x27;o has four children: Maelle, Étienne, Siena and Lynn. He married his longtime sweetheart Georgette on 6 July 2007. Georgette is the mother of Siena and Lynn, who both live with her in Paris. On 17 October 2007, he earned his Spanish passport.

On 9 November 2020, Eto&#x27;o was involved in a car accident, when his 4×4 had a head-on collision with a bus. It was said that Eto&#x27;o was unhurt from the accident. The driver of the bus tried to escape the scene before being apprehended and taken to a police station.

Eto&#x27;o was crowned paramount chief in Kaffu Bullom, a chiefdom in Sierra Leone in November 2015. He was visiting Sierra Leone as part of the FIFA &quot;11 for Health and 11 against Ebola&quot; programme in the country.

He is also a supporter of French club Paris Saint-Germain. 

===Racism===
Eto&#x27;o experienced racial abuse in some away matches during his career. He is one of several high-profile contemporary players to have reacted to the abuse by threatening to leave the pitch and being outspoken in criticism of their experiences.

In February 2005, during an away match with Real Zaragoza, Eto&#x27;o was the subject of racist taunts by Zaragoza supporters, who began making monkey-like chants whenever he had possession of the ball. Referee Fernando Carmona Méndez, however, made no mention of the incidents in his match report, commenting only that the behavior of the crowd was &quot;normal&quot;; two of the abusers were caught and given five-month sporting-event bans after being identified to police by other spectators. Eto&#x27;o later declared that the punishment was insufficient and that La Romareda should have been closed for at least one year, but his manager Frank Rijkaard, of Surinamese origin, told him to concentrate on football and stop talking about the incident. Infuriated again by Zaragoza fans&#x27; racist chants the following season, however, Eto&#x27;o attempted to walk off the pitch in protest. His teammates intervened and convinced him to continue playing.

After experiencing regular racist abuse from sections of support in Spanish crowds, Eto&#x27;o stopped bringing family members to matches. He stated, &quot;It is something that has affected me personally. I think players, leaders, and the media have to join forces so that no one feels looked down upon because of the colour of their skin. At this moment in time I prefer my children don&#x27;t go to football matches. In the stands they have to listen to things that are difficult to explain to a child. It is better they aren&#x27;t exposed to it.&quot;

On 17 October 2010, in a Serie A game against Cagliari, after just three minutes of play, the referee halted the match to give a warning to some Cagliari fans who were singing racist chants towards Eto&#x27;o. After play was resumed, the rest of the stadium chanted loudly in an attempt to drown out the racist chants in order to avoid the match being suspended. Inter went on to win 1–0 with an Eto&#x27;o goal in the 39th minute.

<text>Mann &amp; Machine is an American science fiction/police drama television series that aired for nine episodes on NBC from April 5 to July 14, 1992.

==Synopsis==
Created by Dick Wolf and Robert De Laurentis, the series starred Yancy Butler as Sgt. Eve Edison, a beautiful police officer who is also a sophisticated gynoid capable of learning and emotion. She is partnered with Det. Bobby Mann (David Andrews), a human officer who disdains robots. Rounding out the regular cast was S. Epatha Merkerson as Capt. Claghorn, Mann and Edison&#x27;s superior officer.

The series focused on Mann and Edison&#x27;s criminal investigations in Los Angeles twenty years in the future. An ongoing subplot of the series focused on Eve&#x27;s continuing education about what makes humans tick, and her ever-growing capacity for emotion, highlighted by the penultimate episode &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot; in which Eve is placed in charge of caring for an infant, activating unexpected maternal feelings.

Although Butler received good reviews for her performance in one of her first major roles, the series was criticized heavily, with many comparing it to a failed 1970s comedy series with a similar premise, &quot;Holmes &amp; Yoyo&quot;. The series was pulled from NBC&#x27;s schedule after only four episodes. The remaining five were aired in a burnoff as summertime filler.

<text>Ekıbastūz (, , ەكئباستۇز; ) is a city in Pavlodar Region, northeastern Kazakhstan. It is the administrative center of the Ekibastuz City Administration. The population was Ekıbastūz is served by Ekıbastūz Airport.

==History==
The history of Ekıbastūz begins in the 19th century, when Kosym Pshembayev, a native Kazakh who was commissioned by Russian merchants to look for mineral resources in that region, alighted on a coal field southeast of Pavlodar. The commercial exploitation of the field started soon after. The field afterwards was sold to a British businessman, Leslie Urquhart. The village of Ekıbastūz was established in 1899, named after the nearby lake of the same name, which means 2 heads of salt in Kazakh (&quot;eki&quot; &#x27;two&#x27; + &quot;bas&quot; &#x27;head&#x27; + &quot;tuz&quot; &#x27;salt&#x27;).

The revolution in the Russian Empire, as well as two World Wars, distracted the attention of the state from the exploitation of the field. The village was totally deserted. However, in 1948 the first team (only 50 people) started construction of the future town. The borders of the future open-cast coal fields were also marked at that time.

December 1954 was a significant period for Ekıbastūz, because the first train loads of coal were loaded. From that time the industrial development of Ekıbastūz started. In 1955 the millionth ton of the coal was produced. In the summer of 1958, Georgy Malenkov and his wife were exiled to Ekıbastūz, where they were kept under close surveillance.

The status of the &quot;town&quot; was given to Ekıbastūz on July 12, 1957 by a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. At that time the population of Ekıbastūz was approximately 25,000 people. Nowadays, the population of Ekıbastūz is about 141,000 people.

==Industry==

The Vostochny Coal Mine company is located in Ekıbastūz. Today Ekıbastūz is the biggest open-cast coal field and one of the most perspective open-cast coal regions in the world. It contains more than 13 billion tons of coal in the area of 62 square kilometers. In other words, there are 74 million tons of coal per km3.

Near Ekıbastūz there are two coal fired power plants: GRES-1, with installed capacity of 4,000 MW, and GRES-2, with an installed capacity of 1,000 MW. GRES-2 has the tallest chimney in the world (419.7 m).

The construction of GRES-2 was part of a Program for Ekıbastūz coalfield development, foreseeing to be built four thermal power plants, each one of 4,000 MW (8 units x 500 MWe). In years 1991–93 only Units No 1 and 2 were commissioned. The construction of Unit No 3 was started 1990 but later stopped.

From Ekıbastūz to Kokshetau runs an overhead power line designed for a transmission voltage of 1,150 kV, the Ekıbastūz-Kokshetau powerline.

Located in a naturally arid area, the city of Ekıbastūz and its industries are supplied with water primarily from the Irtysh River, via the Irtysh–Karaganda Canal, which passes about north of Ekıbastūz, where a number of water reservoirs are located.
==Climate==
==Gulag==
It was the location of a major labor camp of the Gulag system maintained by the Soviet Union from the 1920s to the 1950s. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn served in this camp and it is now the Shakhtyor Stadium (Ekibastuz) soccer stadium.

<doc id="1303713" wikidata="Q7448119" url="?curid=1303713" title="Self-insertion">
<text>Self-insertion is a literary device in which the author writes themselves into the story under the guise of, or from the perspective of, a fictional character. The character, overtly or otherwise, behaves like, has the personality of, and may even be described as physically resembling the author or reader of the work.

In visual art, the equivalent of self-insertion is the inserted self-portrait, where the artist includes a self-portrait in a painting of a narrative subject. This has been a common artistic device since at least the European Renaissance.

Among professional writers, the intentional, deliberate use of first-person and third-person self-insertion techniques are commonly considered to be an unoriginal action on the author&#x27;s part, and represents a paucity of creative thought in their writing.

== Literary forms ==
Similar literary devices include the author doubling as the first-person narrator, or writing an author surrogate in the third-person, or adding in a character who is partially based on the author, whether the author included it intentionally or not. Many characters have been described as &quot;unintentional&quot; self-insertions, implying that their author is unconsciously using them as an author surrogate.

Self-insertion can also be employed in a second-person narrative, utilizing the imagination of the reader and his suspension of disbelief. The reader, referred to in the second person, is depicted as interacting with another character, with the intent to encourage the reader&#x27;s immersion and psychological projection of himself into the story, imaging that he, himself, is performing the written story. While examples in published fiction of second-person self-insertion are rare, the use of such is common in fan fiction, in which the reader is paired with a fictional character, often in an intimate setting.

<text>The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR; IAST: &quot;vaigyanik tathā audyogik anusandhāna pariṣada&quot;) is a research and development (R&amp;D) organisation in India to promote scientific, industrial and economic growth. Headquartered in New Delhi, it was established as an autonomous body in 1942 under the aegis of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India. CSIR is among the largest publicly funded R&amp;D organisations in the world. CSIR has pioneered sustained contribution to science and technology (S&amp;T) human resource development in India. 

 it runs 37 laboratories/institutes, 39 outreach centres, 3 Innovation Centres and 5 units throughout the nation, with a collective staff of over 14,000, including a total of 4,600 scientists and 8,000 technical and support personnel. Although it is mainly funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, it operates as an autonomous body through the Societies Registration Act, 1860.

The research and development activities of CSIR include aerospace engineering, structural engineering, ocean sciences, life sciences and healthcare including diagnostics, metallurgy, chemicals, mining, food, petroleum, leather, and environmental science.

N. Kalaiselvi is the present Director General of CSIR-cum-Secretary DSIR, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India.

In terms of Intellectual property, CSIR has 2971 patents in force internationally and 1592 patents in force in India. CSIR is granted more than 14000 patents worldwide since its inception. CSIR was awarded the National Intellectual Property (IP) Award 2018 in the category &quot;Top R&amp;D Institution / Organisation for Patents and Commercialisation&quot; by Indian Patent Office.

In late 2007, the Minister of Science and Technology, Kapil Sibal stated, in a Question Hour session of the Parliament, that CSIR has developed 1,376 technologies/knowledgebase during the last decade of the 20th century.

==History==
In the 1930s, the need for establishing research organisations for the development of natural resources and new industries in India began to emerge. Eminent citizens such as C. V. Raman, Lt. Col. Seymour Sewell and J. C. Ghosh had proposed the creation of an advisory board of scientific research. Sir Richard Gregory, then editor of &quot;Nature&quot;, was among the first people who officially reported to the British Government. After visiting scientific departments and universities in India in 1933, Gregory submitted to Samuel Hoare, Secretary of State for India, regarding the need of scientific organisation similar to the DSIR in Britain. Indian scientists at Calcutta and Bangalore initiated schemes to launch a National Institute of Sciences and an Indian Academy of Sciences, respectively. At the Fifth Industries Conference in 1933, the Provincial Governments of Bombay, Madras, Bihar and Orissa unanimously reiterated their demand for a co-ordinating forum for industrial research. Hoare advised the Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, to support the demand. However, in May 1934, Willingdon replied to Hoare saying, &quot;The creation of a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in India to promote the application of research to natural resources does not appear to be necessary.&quot; While the Indian DSIR was rejected, the colonial government provided a small concession. It instead offered to create an Industrial Intelligence and Research Bureau, which came into operation in April 1935 under the Indian Stores Department. The Bureau&#x27;s limited resources (with a budget of ₹1.0 lakh per annum) made it impossible to initiate major research and industrial activities as had been hoped for; it was mainly concerned with testing and quality control.

At the onset of World War II in 1939, the bureau was proposed to be abolished. Arguably, Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar became the most instrumental in the creation of CSIR in India. As a member of Viceroy&#x27;s executive council, and also of Commerce, he recommended that the Bureau should be terminated, not as a measure of economy, but to make room for a Board of Scientific and Industrial Research, which should be endowed with greater resources and wider objectives. It was by this persistence that the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research (BSIR) was created on 1 April 1940 for a period of two years. Mudaliar became the chair of the board. It was at this point that Bhatnagar was appointed to pilot the board, as the Director. The BSIR was allocated an annual budget of ₹5,00,000 under the Department of Commerce. By the end of 1940, about 80 researchers were engaged, of whom one-quarter was directly employed. Major achievements of BSIR included development of the techniques for the purification of Baluchistan sulphur anti-gas cloth manufacture, vegetable oil blends as fuel and lubricants, plastic packing cases for army boots and ammunition, dyes for uniforms and the preparation of vitamins, and the invention of a pyrethrum emulsifier and cream. In early 1941 Bhatnagar persuaded the government to set up an Industrial Research Utilisation Committee (IRUC) for translating results into application. The government then agreed to make a separate fund out of the royalties received from industry for further investment into industrial research. Mudaliar recommended that an Industrial Research Fund should be constituted, which would have an annual grant of ₹10,00,000 for a period of five years. This was accepted by the Central Assembly in Delhi at its session on 14 November 1941.

Then the constitution of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as an autonomous body was prepared under Mudaliar and Bhatnagar. Thus, CSIR came into operation on 26 September 1942. The BSIR and IRUC were incorporated into the advisory bodies to the governing body of the CSIR. In 1943 the governing body of CSIR approved the proposal of Bhatnagar to establish five national laboratories — the National Chemical Laboratory, the National Physical Laboratory, the Fuel Research Station, the Glass &amp; Ceramics Research Institute and the National Metallurgical Laboratory. In 1944 in addition to its annual budget of ₹10 lakh, CSIR received a grant of ₹1 crore for the establishment of these laboratories. The Tata Industrial House donated ₹20 lakh for the chemical, metallurgical and fuel research laboratories. The foundation for the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute at Kolkata was the first to be laid, in December 1945; National Metallurgical Laboratory at Jamshedpur in November 1946; and that for the National Chemical Laboratory at Pune was the last, on 6 April 1947, four months before India became independent. All the five establishments were completed by 1950.

<text>Paul Rauch (1930 – December 10, 2012) was an American television and film producer. Rauch&#x27;s work was primarily in American soap operas.

==Career==
Rauch&#x27;s earlier jobs included Vice President, Programs-East Coast for CBS, Supervising Producer for Procter &amp; Gamble, and Music Critic for an English-language edition of the Japanese &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, a job he held in his mid-twenties.

==Daytime drama==
===&quot;Another World&quot;===
Rauch is best known for his work on &quot;Another World&quot;, which he produced from 1972 to 1982. For much of that time, he worked in conjunction with head writer Harding Lemay, and the team garnered the show critical acclaim and strong ratings. In the 1970s Daytime ratings, &quot;Another World&quot; often rose to the top of the ratings, just below number one show &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

Rauch led the show to an expanded hour format in 1975, which was a success. However, a subsequent time expansion to 90 minutes in 1979 was less successful.

During his tenure on &quot;Another World&quot;, he served as co-creator and executive producer of two other NBC soap operas. Rauch first co-created &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot; (January–May 1977) with Lemay; however, the low ratings under its original format prompted NBC to put the show on what would be a seven-month hiatus during the Summer and Fall of 1977, with the soap being reworked as &quot;For Richer For Poorer&quot; (1977–78). Two years after &quot;For Richer For Poorer&quot; was canceled, Rauch teamed with the husband-and-wife team of John William and Joyce Corrington to create &quot;Texas&quot; (1980–82), a spin-off of &quot;Another World&quot; envisioned as a daytime equivalent to the hit CBS prime time soap &quot;Dallas&quot;; Rauch served as executive producer of the show (simultaneous with his showrunner duties on &quot;Another World&quot;) until 1981.

===Other daytime credits===
Following his works on &quot;Another World&quot; (1972–1982), &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot; and &quot;For Richer For Poorer&quot;, and &quot;Texas&quot; (1980–1981), he was hired by ABC Daytime to be a producer for &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1983. He served as executive producer from 1984 to 1991.

In Ellen Holly’s book, Holly is vocal about her frustration at her character being pushed into the background to make way for new white characters, and about being summarily dismissed in 1985 by Rauch, who by that time had become executive producer and writing consultant. Rauch fired every Black lead or recurring character on One Life To Live during his 1984-91 tenure.

In addition, he was executive producer of &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1991 to 1993, and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1996 to 2002.

Rauch appeared at the end of the final episode of &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; on January 15, 1993. The final shot consisted of Rauch standing in front of the camera, smashing a cigar under his shoe, and walking away.

From 2003 to 2005, he was an executive consulting producer to a period-drama that aired on Russian television, called &quot;Bednaya Nastya&quot;. From 2008 to 2011, he was the executive producer of the serial &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

On August 22, 2013, Grant Aleksander, who had portrayed Phillip Spaulding on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1983 through the series finale in 2009, revealed in an interview with Carolyn Hinsey that Rauch had been working on a continuation of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; at the time of his death on December 10, 2012. According to the interview he had consulted with the Big Networks executives regarding the proposal and Procter &amp; Gamble were interested as well.

===Other credits===
In 2009 Paul Rauch was named &quot;The Greatest Daytime Producer of All Time&quot; by TV Guide Canada, while he served as co-executive producer of the #1 daytime show &quot;The Young &amp; the Restless&quot;. Rauch also produced the feature films &quot;Lover&#x27;s Knot&quot; (Cannes Film Festival) and &quot;Run the Wild Fields&quot; (Film Advisory Board Award, special honors at the Sarasota Film Festival, Emmy, Best Family Film), as well as the 100-episode primetime series &quot;Poor Nastya&quot; for Sony Pictures Int. and Russia 3.

==Personal life==
At the time of his death, aged 82, Rauch was married to concert pianist Israela Margalit. The couple lived in New York City.

<text>Alvaston (/ˈɒlvəstən/ or /ˈælvəstən/) is a village and ward of Derby, in the ceremonial county of Derbyshire, England. Alvaston is on the A6 three miles south-east of Derby city centre and probably owes its name to an individual called Ælfwald.

The village of Alvaston has existed since at least the 11th century. Rapid expansion came in the second half of the 19th century and in 1904 the electric tram replaced the horse-bus service and, with the advent of the motor car, London Road became the A6. It became part of Derby in the late 20th century.

The smaller, neighbouring village of Boulton has been swallowed up by Alvaston, and Boulton is rarely referred to by name.

== History ==
The village is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. It expanded rapidly with the coming of improved public transport to Derby, and the arrival of the railways and associated employment in the mid-19th century. Alvaston was the terminus of a tram route, and later a trolleybus route, which ran along London Road.

Few of the buildings in Alvaston date from before this era. There are several parallel streets of terraced Victorian housing in the Crewton district, large Edwardian detached villas stringing out away from the village centre, 1930s semi-detached homes, and a large expanse of post-Second World War council housing.

== Governance ==
Alvaston is part of the Derby South (UK Parliament constituency) constituency for Westminster elections.

In the 2023 Derby City Council election, all 6 of Alvaston&#x27;s members of Derby City Council were from Reform UK.

In 1881 the civil parish had a population of 1302. On 25 March 1884 the parish was abolished to form Alvaston and Boulton, part also went to Elvaston. It is now in the unparished area of Derby, in the Derby district.

== Geography ==
Alvaston lies to the southeast of Derby city centre, bounded to the east by the A6 dual carriageway, and to the north by the River Derwent. It is bordered to the north by the wards of Chaddesden East, Chaddesden West and Spondon; to the west by the city centre, Sinfin and Osmaston; to the south by Chellaston and Shelton Lock; and to the east by the district of South Derbyshire.

Two miles to the west lies the site of the Derby Canal, the 19th-century township of Allenton, and the Osmaston Park Industrial Estate. To the north-west on the A6 towards Derby, a small settlement of Victorian terraced homes forms Wilmorton. The Pride Park development, which includes the Derby County football stadium, is a short walk away. To the north, the River Derwent flows from Derby towards its confluence with the River Trent. The long-established chemical works of Celenese(formally Accordis and Courtaulds) are the northern bank, towards Spondon. To the east lies the open countryside of South Derbyshire and Elvaston Castle Country Park, a favourite place for picnics and lakeside walks. To the south, Boulton Moor stretches towards Chellaston and Aston-on-Trent. Perched on the edge of the settlement, on Stocker Flat and overlooking Boulton Moor may be found a maze of 1970s–1980s-built culs-de-sac and footpaths, leading to council and privately built homes.

== Economy ==
Alvaston is mainly residential. The main shopping centre of Alvaston can be found at the junction of the A6 London Road and the A5111 Derby Ring Road. Alvaston shopping centre holds a small number of chain and independent shops, including a men&#x27;s barbers, and two card shops 
In recent years a lot of independent shops have closed down and have been replaced with many takeaways.

== Culture and community ==
The main parks are Alvaston Park, Keldholme Lane Park and Kiwi Park.

Alvaston Park is a picturesque, riverside park covering 85 acres. As well as the sports facilities mentioned below, it has a lake with fishing and a model boat club, a science garden, play area and a new café. The park opened to the public in 1913 after William Curzon of Breedon Hall made some of his land available. It was landscaped by William Barron and Son of Borrowash – a firm founded by the young Scotsman who laid out the park at Elvaston Castle for Lord Harrington in 1830. A five-acre lake was added in 1923 but in 1934 it was found to be badly polluted and the town council had to urgently clear Cotton Brook to restore the water purity of the lake in time for the carnival. During the Second World War the park was used as a prisoner of war camp, part of which was for Germans and the other for Italians. The Italians worked in the fields of local farmers and the Germans worked at the ordnance depot on Sinfin Lane. A further 61.8 acres was added after the Second World War for use as playing fields.

== Landmarks ==

Aside from the church, listed buildings in the village include Church Farm and its associated cottages on Church Street, which date to the early 16th or early 17th century. There is another Grade-II-listed farmhouse dating from the 18th century on Boulton Lane. The Poplars, in Ellastone Gardens, is a Grade-II Georgian building with an iron shield of arms on the side elevation.

<doc id="1303732" wikidata="Q3298251" url="?curid=1303732" title="Roseland Peninsula">
<text>The Roseland Peninsula, or just Roseland, (, meaning &quot;promontory&quot;) is a district of west Cornwall, England. Roseland is located in the south of the county and contains the town of St Mawes and villages such as St Just and Gerrans. It is a peninsula, separated from the remainder of Cornwall by the River Fal (on the east is the English Channel).

Where the peninsula begins continues to be a point of discussion amongst local historians and long-time Roseland inhabitants. The village of Tregony might be considered to be outside the Roseland. If travelling by road one enters the Roseland at the bottom of Tregony Hill by either driving up Reskivers Hill to take the road to St. Mawes and Gerrans, or by taking the lower road to Ruan Lanihorne. The Roseland Plan, a neighbourhood plan produced in 2015, defined Roseland as the areas of the civil parishes of St-Just-in-Roseland (which includes St Mawes), Gerrans, Philleigh, Ruanlanihorne and Veryan.

One of Britain&#x27;s most infamous unsolved murders was committed on the peninsula in 1998. 41-year-old Lyn Bryant was randomly and repeatedly stabbed while walking her dog in Ruan High Lanes on 20 October 1998. Her attacker has never been identified despite one of the longest-running and largest ever investigations by Devon and Cornwall Police, although the killer&#x27;s DNA was isolated in 2018. There remains a £10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of her killer.

Until 2021 there was a Roseland electoral division of Cornwall Council which also covered St Mawes, the population of which at the 2011 census was 3,375.

==History and geography==
;John Norden
In 1584 map maker John Norden wrote, &#x27;The peninsula is called by the pretty name of Roseland, being derived from Rhos, the Celtic word for heath or gorse.&#x27; He goes on to say that, &quot;Roseland is a circuit of land lying between the creek of Falmouth haven and the sea.&quot;

;John Whitaker
&quot;Lake&#x27;s Parochial History of the County of Cornwall&quot; (1870) includes Revd John Whitaker’s discussion of the Roseland when dealing with Philleigh parish. He notes that the villages of Veryan and Ruanlanihorne each has its church in a valley, the area which would have been inhabited first as the valleys were more sheltered and benefited from soil washed down from the hillsides. At the top of the hills lay an extensive heath (or rhos/rôs).

Whitaker believed that the area was first named &#x27;Roseland&#x27; when the English came to settle in 936. The parish of Philleigh was carved out of the parish of Ruanlanihorne and was originally called Eglos-rôs. Two fields were tithable in common between Ruanlanihorne and Philleigh (Higher and Lower Congier) which he claims proves the two parishes were once one. According to Hals (in &quot;Lake&#x27;s Parochial History&quot;) St Just in Roseland was rated under the jurisdiction of Eglos-rôs (Philleigh) in the Domesday Book.

From this it seems reasonable to assume that the first people to use the term ‘Roseland’ understood it to cover the parishes which contained the ‘rhos/rôs ’, so the parishes of Veryan, Ruanlanihorne and Philleigh have a good claim to be part of the Roseland.

So it seems to make sense to regard the Roseland as starting at Daddiport Bridge at the foot of Reskivers Hill. The stream which comes down the hillside to Daddiport Bridge is the boundary between Veryan and Tregony parishes, thus continuing the water boundary of the peninsula. That is the way locals now see the Roseland Peninsula.

;20th century writers
In &quot;The Roseland: between River and Sea&quot;, Laurence O&#x27;Toole described it rather differently, including the parishes of Gerrans, St Anthony in Roseland, St Just, and St Mawes and so only taking the parishes that protrude on that thin arm of the land.

Place House at St Anthony was the seat of the Spry family for several hundred years. It has been enviously described by Joe Bennett in his travel book &quot;Mustn&#x27;t Grumble&quot;, 2006.

;Murder of Lyn Bryant
In a highly publicised case, a 41-year-old local woman named Lyn Bryant was murdered while out walking her dog on the peninsula near Ruan High Lanes on 20 October 1998. The murder featured heavily in the press, media and on &quot;Crimewatch&quot;, but her attacker has never been identified and the murder remains one of the highest profile unsolved murders in the UK. At the time, police believed that her random and apparently motiveless killing might be linked to the murder of 14-year-old Kate Bushell in another rural lane in Exeter one year previously. Both had been randomly killed with knives while out walking their dogs down isolated lanes in the south west. 

An unknown man had been seen talking to Bryant by Ruan Methodist Church that afternoon, only minutes before she was murdered only 100 yards (91 meters) away. Earlier in the day a different man with a full beard in a small white van (who was apparently not local) had also been seen following her in her car. In 2018, a DNA profile of Bryant&#x27;s attacker was identified. The investigation into her death is one of the largest ever conducted by Devon and Cornwall Police and had cost nearly £2 million by 2018. There remains a £10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of her killer. 

==Film and television==

Channel 4&#x27;s 1992 series &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;, adapted from Mary Wesley&#x27;s novel, was shot at the National Trust property Broom Parc on the Roseland Peninsula. The series starred Felicity Kendal, Paul Eddington, Claire Bloom, Jennifer Ehle &amp; Rebecca Hall and was directed by Sir Peter Hall.

The 2009 film documentary &quot;And Did Those Feet&quot; suggests that Jesus Christ may have visited the Roseland Peninsula. The legend of Christ&#x27;s visit to England is depicted in William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot;.

<text>South Beach is an American action/adventure television series that aired on NBC from June 6 to August 12, 1993, during the summer of 1993. The series was created by Dick Wolf and Robert DeLaurentis and starred Yancy Butler, who had been the lead actress a year earlier in another failed Wolf/DeLaurentis series, &quot;Mann &amp; Machine&quot;.

Set in South Beach, Florida, the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;-inspired storyline had Butler playing Kate Patrick, a thief who, along with her partner Vernon, is given the choice of going to jail or working for a government agency run by a man named Roberts (played by John Glover). The series saw Kate and Vernon (played by Eagle-Eye Cherry) take on various missions for Roberts, which usually called on the duo to make use of their skills as thieves. The series also co-starred Patti D&#x27;Arbanville. The first episode guest-starred the British actor, Christopher Bowen as Dimitriev.

Seven episodes were produced of this series, but only six were aired.

<doc id="1303737" wikidata="Q215369" url="?curid=1303737" title="Stephen Gately">
<text>Stephen Patrick David Gately (17 March 197610 October 2009) was an Irish singer, who, with Ronan Keating, was co-lead singer of the pop group Boyzone. All of Boyzone&#x27;s studio albums during Gately&#x27;s lifetime hit number one in the United Kingdom, their third being their most successful internationally. With Boyzone, Gately had a record-breaking sixteen consecutive singles enter the top five of the UK Singles Chart. He performed for millions of fans globally. He released a solo album in 2000, after the group&#x27;s initial break-up, which charted in the UK top ten and yielded three UK hit singles, including the top three hit &quot;New Beginning&quot;. Gately went on to appear in stage productions and on television programmes as well as contributing songs to various projects. In 2008, he rejoined his colleagues as Boyzone reformed for a series of concerts and recordings.

Gately made his sexuality known in 1999 and came out to publicity. He became publicly committed to Andrew Cowles, first in a commitment ceremony in Las Vegas in 2003 and more formally in a civil partnership ceremony in London in 2006. Upon Boyzone&#x27;s reformation, Gately featured as part of the first gay couple in a boyband music video for &quot;Better&quot;, in what was to be his last with the band. Gately died of a congenital heart defect in a flat that he and Cowles owned in Mallorca, Spain, in 2009. Brian Boyd in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; stated: &quot;Stephen Gately&#x27;s death represents the first time that the boyband genre has had to deal with such a tragic situation&quot;. Tim Teeman of &quot;The Times&quot; (UK) heralded Gately as a hero of gay rights for his response to being &quot;smoked out of the closet&quot;.

==Early life==
Gately grew up in relative poverty in the working-class Sheriff Street area of Dublin. He was the fourth of five children; his father Martin was a decorator and his mother, Margaret (born 1949) a cleaner. His siblings are Michelle, Tony, Alan and Mark. He was particularly close to sister Michelle throughout his life. Gately&#x27;s father had an accident as a result of which he had to be hospitalised for three months from September 2004. His mother then took over as full-time carer. Gately attended primary school at St Laurence O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s and secondary school at North Strand Technical College. As a teenager he appeared in various musicals and theatre performances at school, such as &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;. He was estranged from his parents for years, but reconciled with them in 2008 and visited them with Andrew Cowles that year.

==Career==

===Boyzone===
Gately joined Boyzone upon their formation in 1993. The group became known in Ireland after an infamous appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; that year, which presenter Gay Byrne dismissed—although he later concluded: &quot;They certainly had the last laugh on us&quot;. Boyzone&#x27;s first success outside Ireland was when the song &quot;Love Me for a Reason&quot; reached number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1995. The group split suddenly following a string of performances in Dublin&#x27;s Point Theatre in 2000. By the time Boyzone originally rested the band, they had achieved six number ones on the UK Singles Chart. They were considered a major pop band of the 1990s and had a much publicised rivalry with UK boy band Take That, even selling more singles than them. Gately shared the majority of lead vocal work with Ronan Keating.

A February appearance at the 2008 Meteor Awards relaunched the reformed Boyzone, with touring taking place throughout 2008. After his death, manager Louis Walsh described Gately as &quot;the glue in Boyzone, he kept them all together&quot;. Keating informed the congregation at Gately&#x27;s funeral that he had nicknames for them all; &quot;the campest straight band in the world&quot;—Rosaleen, Michaela, Kitty, Shanice and Stephanie.

===Solo career===
After success with Boyzone, the band decided in 2000 to move on to solo projects. Gately was the second, with his debut solo single, &quot;New Beginning&quot;, released on 29 May 2000. The single reached number three in the UK charts.

Two weeks later the album &quot;New Beginning&quot; was released and entered the charts. The album included twelve tracks including a version of the classic &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, which he recorded for the soundtrack to the TV version of &quot;Watership Down&quot;. He also voiced one of the characters in the series, Blackavar, which was created to look like him. His character only spoke for 3 episodes, before becoming a background character.

The second single taken from the album was &quot;I Believe&quot;. Released on 2 October 2000, this song also featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;. The single just missed the UK top ten, peaking at number eleven. He attended the premieres of the film both at the Edinburgh Film Festival and at the Empire, Leicester Square, along with the stars of the film, Julie Walters and Jamie Bell. In May 2001, Gately&#x27;s third single, &quot;Stay&quot;, was released and reached number thirteen in the UK chart. That month, with his single still in the charts, his record company Polydor dropped him from their label.

===Boyzone&#x27;s reformation and final projects===

In 2008 following his solo career and various bouts of acting and television appearances, Gately rejoined his old colleagues when Boyzone reformed, following the success of revived contemporaries Take That. Gately had been the most eager to reform and urged his bandmates to come together again. They sold out two more tours of the United Kingdom.

Boyzone released a brand new single, &quot;Love You Anyway&quot;, followed by a new compilation album in October 2008. December 2008 saw the release of a second new single, &quot;Better&quot;. The video for the song generated controversy, as scenes depicting romantic couples included a shot of two men embracing, in an inclusive nod to Gately&#x27;s homosexuality. The group unanimously agreed that Gately should be allowed to pair with a male actor. It was condemned by, among others, the minister of the Dromore Reformed Presbyterian Church. Others, however, cite that milestone as among the reasons why Gately is a &quot;gay rights hero&quot;. Wrote Tim Teeman of the &quot;Times Online&quot;, &quot;Gately showed that an unflamboyant guy could be a pop star and gay...the real shame should be reserved for those managers and showbusiness power-brokers who practise that kind of discrimination, and also maintain the closet, to line their pockets.&quot;

At the time of Gately&#x27;s death the group had selected thirty songs which they intended to record for a new album to be released in 2010. This was to have been followed by a tour.

Gately&#x27;s vocals featured on Boyzone&#x27;s final album, in a song called &quot;I Can Dream&quot;. A video of the song was released on 15 June 2018, featuring images of Gately and Boyzone. The album was released on 16 November 2018.

==Other work==
===Acting and television===
In 1999 Gately took part in animated television series &quot;Watership Down&quot;, where he voiced Blackavar and performed show&#x27;s theme song, a cover of Art Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; (included in the previous adaptation from 1978).

In December 2002, Gately took the lead role in Bill Kenwright&#x27;s new production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, which previewed in Oxford in December 2002 before moving to Liverpool over Christmas 2002 and finally to London&#x27;s West End and the New London Theatre in Drury Lane in February 2003. From September 2004 until March 2005 Gately played the Child Catcher in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; at the London Palladium.

In 2001 he made a cameo as himself in the fourth series of BBC sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, in that series&#x27; opening episode &quot;Parralox&quot;.

Gately made his pantomime debut at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley in December 2005 starring as Dandini in &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In April 2006 he took on the role of The Scarecrow in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at the Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury.

Gately also took part in Channel Five&#x27;s &quot;All Star Talent Show&quot; in October 2006, performing the slice and dice magic trick which he only had a week to learn, coming second to Toby Anstis. He was also in the second series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; with his dancing partner Kristina Lenko. They went out in eighth place on 10 February 2007.

In January 2007, Gately was heard in &quot;Horror of Glam Rock&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama produced by Big Finish Productions for BBC7. For this audio play, Gately recorded an original song, &quot;Children of Tomorrow&quot;, with music by Tim Sutton and lyrics by Barnaby Edwards; this was his first solo track since 2001.

In September 2007, Gately began touring the UK in an 11-week run of Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s rock musical &quot;Godspell&quot; but withdrew from the production after just three weeks for contractual reasons.

In 2008, Gately appeared in the independent horror film, &quot;Credo&quot;, which was released in the United States as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Curse&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
Gately was a vice patron of the charity Missing People (formerly National Missing Persons Helpline), supporting their Runaway Helpline service for young people. He was an ambassador for the Caudwell Children Charity in Stoke and on one occasion gave a private Christmas performance, raising thousands of pounds. Gately&#x27;s family requested that donations be given to the charity instead of flowers sent to them after his death in 2009. This in turn raised thousands more pounds. On one visit to a hospital he met a terminally ill child who admired the jacket he was wearing, and Gately allowed her to have it.

===Writing===
During the three years prior to his death, Gately had been writing a children&#x27;s fantasy novel called &quot;The Tree of Seasons&quot;. In an April 2009 interview with the Press Association he declared that he was nearly finished, had publisher interest, and hoped for a Christmas 2009 release. Boyzone bandmate Ronan Keating promised at Gately&#x27;s funeral that &quot;by hook or by crook&quot; the book would be finished.

&quot;The Tree of Seasons&quot; was written in collaboration with June Considine and Jules Williams. Based on Gately&#x27;s handwritten notes – the day he died he had just worked out the ending. The book released in the UK and Ireland on 13 May 2010, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. It contains a foreword by Elton John and David Furnish, and is illustrated by Keith Wilson. &quot;The Tree of Seasons&quot; remained a bestseller and a top-ten seller for three consecutive weeks. The paperback version was released in April 2011.

==Personal life==
Gately came out as gay in 1999 after discovering that an acquaintance was about to sell the details of his sexuality to the media.

From 2000 to 2002, Gately suffered from depression and addiction to prescription drugs.

Gately started dating Andrew Cowles, an internet businessman who had been introduced to him by mutual friends Elton John and David Furnish. Gately and Cowles held a commitment ceremony in a wedding chapel while on holiday in Las Vegas in 2003. On 19 March 2006, Gately entered into a civil partnership with Cowles in a ceremony in London. The couple lived together in the north London village of Highgate. Gately spoke of his love for the village, saying he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t move away for the world. It has a great vibe and the people here are brilliant&quot;. In July 2009, their home was broken into by thieves who took £80,000 of items, including a prized Rolex watch which Gately had purchased with his first pay cheque. Gately was based in London for the rest of his life.

His manager Louis Walsh was unaware of Gately&#x27;s sexuality when he selected him for Boyzone and has said that, had he known, he would have thought twice before picking him, claiming less than a year before his death that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t cool then to have a gay guy in a band&quot;. After the singer&#x27;s death, Walsh described Gately as his &quot;very, very best friend&quot;, saying: &quot;Of all the people I&#x27;ve worked with I don&#x27;t think anybody thanked me as much as Stephen. He used to always say to me, &#x27;If I wasn&#x27;t in Boyzone I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be today, thank you&#x27;&quot;.

Gately&#x27;s idol was Michael Jackson, whom he met at RDS Arena in 1997 when Jackson was embarking on his HIStory World Tour. Jackson died four months prior to Gately&#x27;s death.

==Death==
Gately died at his home in Port d&#x27;Andratx, Mallorca, early on 10 October 2009. His body was discovered later in the morning. His death was later determined to have been caused by a pulmonary oedema resulting from an undiagnosed heart condition.

Gately had spent the evening with his partner Cowles at the Black Cat club in Mallorca&#x27;s capital, Palma. They returned home with a man that they had met that night, Bulgarian national Georgi Dochev. Dochev stayed in the spare bedroom. According to Dochev, he discovered Gately&#x27;s body lying on a sofa as he was about to leave. He woke Cowles, who was sleeping alone in the couple&#x27;s bedroom. However, Gately&#x27;s solicitor and family friend, Gerald Kean, insisted Cowles was the one who found Gately&#x27;s body. Spanish police were alerted at 1:45 pm by Cowles, after he had tried to revive Gately. Gately was squatting in an awkward position on the sofa, dressed in his pyjamas. Police said they had no reason to believe the death was related to abuse of substances, and no suicide note or signs of violence were found on his body.

Gately&#x27;s bandmates flew to Mallorca on 11 October 2009. The remaining members of Boyzone, Keith Duffy, Michael Graham, Ronan Keating, and Shane Lynch, issued a joint statement: We are completely devastated by the loss of our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen&#x27;s family. We love you and will miss you forever, &#x27;Steo&#x27;.A post-mortem and toxicology tests took place on 13 October and this examination showed that Gately died of natural causes. His death was a result of a congenital heart defect.

On 16 October, accompanied by the four remaining members of Boyzone, his body was brought from Mallorca to Dublin where his funeral took place at St Laurence O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s Church, Seville Place the following day. The four surviving members of Boyzone maintained an overnight vigil in the church the night before. Thousands of fans, celebrities, and politicians were in attendance at the funeral. Fans had travelled from as far as South Africa, and Taiwan to attend the funeral. He was cremated in a private ceremony later that afternoon. Gately&#x27;s coffin was carried into and out of the church by his bandmates, and during the service Ronan Keating gave a eulogy, during which he broke down several times and apologised to the congregation. Keith Duffy reminisced on the early days: &quot;He told Louis [Walsh] he was 5ft 7in (170 cm). When he auditioned for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; later on, he said he was 5ft 3in (160 cm). But he was a true giant of a man&quot;. Michael Graham said Gately had only told him the previous week how much he loved Cowles, adding: &quot;When he came out, he finally became himself&quot;. The funeral clashed with the wedding of a niece of Bertie Ahern and several of her guests defected to the funeral instead.

===Reaction===
Fans responded with messages of sympathy on Twitter and Facebook. Thousands of pounds were donated by fans to a Stoke-based children&#x27;s charity which Gately had endorsed. Boyzone&#x27;s record catalogue was propelled back into the music charts. The single &quot;No Matter What&quot;, on which Gately is a prominent vocalist, received heavy play on radio.

Boyzone&#x27;s former manager Louis Walsh said: &quot;We&#x27;re all absolutely devastated. I&#x27;m in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday at an awards ceremony. We don&#x27;t know much about what&#x27;s happened yet. I only heard after &quot;The X Factor&quot; (UK television talent show on which Walsh is a judge) and we will rally around each other this week. He was a great man.&quot; &quot;My First Time&quot;, a stage show which was set to star bandmember Keith Duffy, was cancelled entirely. The four surviving members of Boyzone had memorial tattoos when they brought Gately&#x27;s body home.

Irish boy band Westlife said: &quot;We are, like everyone else, in shock today. We met Stephen Gately back in 1998 when we first started out and since then had the pleasure of meeting him many times. Himself and the Boyzone lads paved the way for us as a band. Our thoughts are with Andy and the rest of his family, his friends, his legions of fans and of course his bandmates Keith, Mikey, Shane and Ronan who will be devastated at the loss of a truly beautiful person.&quot; Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said: &quot;It&#x27;s so sad. Boyzone and Stephen, they&#x27;ve all been part of Irish life and far wider than that, the last 15 years, and so successful, so it&#x27;s a huge, huge tragedy. He was 33 years of age, 15 years at the top, a fine musician, it&#x27;s just a huge tragedy to Irish entertainment, Irish music and further afield as well&quot;.

====&quot;Daily Mail&quot; article====
An article by Jan Moir in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 16 October 2009 claimed: &quot;Healthy and fit 33-year-old men do not just climb into their pyjamas and go to sleep on the sofa, never to wake up again. Whatever the cause of death is, it is not, by any yardstick, a natural one.&quot; She suggested that drugs and a &quot;dangerous lifestyle&quot; were to blame for Gately&#x27;s death.

Moir&#x27;s article resulted in over 25,000 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) that day. The article was widely criticised in the media. The PCC did not uphold the complaint, stating: &quot;It found the article caused some offence but there was insufficient evidence it breached the law&quot;.

===Legacy===
In September 2020, Dublin City Council agreed to name &quot;Stephen Gately Park&quot; after the singer. This has yet to be enacted as it clashes with Dublin City Council&#x27;s 20-year cooling off period.

<text>Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSAs) are a class of psychiatric drugs used primarily as antidepressants. They act by antagonizing the α2-adrenergic receptor and certain serotonin receptors such as 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C, but also 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and/or 5-HT7 in some cases. By blocking α2-adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, NaSSAs enhance adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain involved in mood regulation, notably 5-HT1A-mediated transmission. In addition, due to their blockade of certain serotonin receptors, serotonergic neurotransmission is not facilitated in unwanted areas, which prevents the incidence of many side effects often associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants; hence, in part, the &quot;specific serotonergic&quot; label of NaSSAs.

==List of NaSSAs==
The NaSSAs include the following agents:

* Aptazapine (CGS-7525A)
* Esmirtazapine (ORG-50,081)
* Mianserin (Bolvidon, Norval, Tolvon)
* Mirtazapine (Norset, Remeron, Avanza, Zispin)
* Setiptiline/teciptiline (Tecipul)

Notably, all of these compounds are analogues and are also classified as tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs) based on their chemical structures.

S32212, a structurally novel NaSSA with an improved selectivity profile (e.g., no antihistamine effects, etc.), was reported in 2012. It has completed preliminary preclinical research and may go on to undergo clinical trials.

==See also==
* Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI)
* Serotonin modulator and stimulator (SMS)
* Norepinephrine-dopamine disinhibitor (NDDI)
* Tetracyclic antidepressant
* Norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor
* Atypical antidepressant

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, usually in a leading truck or bogie, eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles and no trailing wheels. In North America and in some other countries the type was usually known as the Twelve-wheeler.

==Overview==
The first locomotive is believed to have been the &quot;Centipede&quot;, a tender locomotive built by Ross Winans in 1855 for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the United States of America, where it remained in service for nearly twenty years. It appears to have been delivered in a cab-forward type of configuration that was modified to a Camel configuration in 1864. On a Camel locomotive the cab was mounted atop the boiler, unlike the later Camelback locomotive whose cab straddled the boiler which first appeared around 1877.
The nickname Mastodon is often mistakenly used to describe the wheel arrangement and was derived from the unofficial name of the first locomotive of the Central Pacific Railroad in the United States, the wood-fired CPR no. 229, which was designed and built in 1882 by the railroad&#x27;s master mechanic, Andrew Jackson (A.J.) Stevens, at the railroad&#x27;s Sacramento works in California. However, several period publications instead use the nickname Mastodon to refer to the 4-10-0. These publications refer to the as the Twelve-wheeler.

==Usage==

===Australia===
The wheel arrangement saw service in Australia from 1900. In Tasmania, the privately owned Emu Bay Railway ordered four tender locomotives for their gauge system. In 1911, another locomotive was delivered from the North British Locomotive Company. Two of these locomotives are preserved.
A new class of locomotive, the T class, designed in South Australia for use on the narrow gauge gauge system of the South Australian Railways, was introduced in 1903. It proved to be a suitable workhorse and by 1917 there were 78 locomotives in the class. In 1921 and 1922, the Tasmanian Government also purchased six of these narrow gauge South Australian locomotives and, during 1922 and 1923, five of the class were converted to gauge for use on the broad gauge system of the South Australian. These were converted back to narrow gauge in 1949. During the Second World War, the Commonwealth Railways obtained four of these South Australian narrow gauge locomotives on loan. Several of these locomotives are preserved.
The Queensland Government Railways (QGR) introduced its C16 class of locomotives in 1903, built at its Ipswich workshops. Altogether 152 of these locomotives were in service by 1917. Beginning in 1920, a number of the QGR C16 class locomotives were equipped with superheaters on an experimental basis, but since their slide valves were not suited to superheated steam and became prone to steam leaks due to excessive wear, they were soon converted back to use saturated steam. During the Second World War, the Commonwealth Government also acquired eleven C16 class locomotives on loan. Only one example of this class was preserved.

The QGR&#x27;s superheated C17 class entered service from 1920. The Commonwealth Railways also ordered 22 locomotives of the same design for their narrow gauge rail system, designated the NM class. In total, the C17 class eventually numbered 227 locomotives, of which twenty are preserved.

In 1922, the QGR ordered 22 new locomotives and designated them the C19 class. They were the largest conventional-type locomotives to operate on the QGR.

===Austria===
In Austria, the wheel arrangement was used for express locomotives. The Class 570 locomotive was introduced in 1915 and the class 113 locomotive of the Austrian Federal Railways was introduced in 1923. From 1938, both classes were re-designated as Class 33 on the Deutsche Reichsbahn. 

===Bechuanaland===
In 1897, four Cape 7th Class locomotives were ordered by the Cape Government Railways (CGR) from Neilson and Company for use on the new Vryburg to Bulawayo line of the fledgling Bechuanaland Railway Company (BR). The line through Bechuanaland Protectorate was still under construction and was operated by the CGR on behalf of the BR at the time. The locomotives were eventually returned to the CGR and were designated Class 7A on the South African Railways in 1912.

===France===

In France, the wheel arrangement was used on two locomotive classes. The first was in 1907 by the &quot;Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée&quot; (PLM). These locomotives were intended for goods trains, as well as passenger trains on the more difficult routes. They were Baudry type compound locomotives, similar to the De Glehn type, but with their low pressure cylinders set at 60% cut-off. All of them originally used saturated steam, but some were later equipped with superheaters while all the others were provided with feedwater heaters. These locomotives had a maximum speed limit of and were designed to be able to haul 1,177 long tons at . A total of 282 were built. The PLM had prepared designs for another much larger locomotive by 1913, but it did not materialise as a result of the outbreak of the First World War.
The second locomotive to appear in France was the famous 240P class of the &quot;Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français&quot; (SNCF), with &quot;240&quot; in this instance referring to the French classification of wheel arrangement according to the number and arrangement of axles rather than wheels. Technically, these locomotives were developments of some of the earliest Pacific locomotives in Europe that were built for the &quot;Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans&quot; (PO). The 240P class was considered to be one of André Chapelon&#x27;s finest designs and benefited from his thorough understanding of thermodynamics and his appreciation of the need to consider the entirety of the steam circuit. The locomotive was a four-cylinder compound, fitted with Lentz-Dabeg poppet valves.

Coupled with an elegant French style tender, the second batch of the 240P class was aesthetically much more pleasing. With a power output of , the 240P class was reputed to have the highest power-to-weight ratio of any steam locomotive. Discussion continues as to how robust they were mechanically, for example whether the size of the bearings was too near the bone, or whether they were simply worked to death during the difficult war years. None have survived in preservation.

In the 1920s, the &quot;Magyar Államvasutak&quot; (Hungarian State Railways or MÁV) adopted the type as their standard mixed-traffic locomotive in the shape of the 424 class, which was built between 1924 and 1958. Of these, 365 were built for Hungary and 149 for foreign systems, including the Yugoslav Railways, the Soviet Union and North Korea. In Yugoslavia, they were designated the &quot;Jugoslovenske Železnice&quot; (JŽ) class 11. The last of the Hungarian locomotives were withdrawn from service in 1984. 

===Ireland===
For a short period, the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland and its successor, the Great Southern Railways, operated two inside-cylinder shunting locomotives. Intended for shunting at Dublin Kingsbridge (now Heuston) and for banking on the steep gradient out of Cork Glanmire Road (now Kent), the first locomotive emerged from the company&#x27;s Inchicore workshops in 1915 and the second in 1924. They proved unsuccessful, being expensive to operate and unsuitable for sharp curves, and were withdrawn in 1928 and 1931 respectively.

On the Irish three-foot gauge, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway operated two tender locomotives. Built by Hudswell Clarke, they were introduced in 1905 and withdrawn in the 1930s and 1940s. The two were the only tender locomotives ever to operate on that gauge in Ireland and, with two subsequent tank engines from the same manufacturer, were considered to be the most powerful which ever worked on any Irish narrow-gauge railway.

===Mexico===
4-8-0 locomotives in Mexico were almost entirely built in the United States. The first locomotives were provided by the Southern Pacific Railroad to independent and subsidiary railroads such as the Cananae, Rio Yaqui &amp; Pacifico and Sud Pacifico de Mexico. The Sud Pacifico de Mexico used, in total, 14 of the Southern Pacific&#x27;s 4-8-0s, including a few from CRY&amp;P, all constructed at Schenectady between 1889 and 1895.

The National Railways of Mexico had four classes of 4-8-0. The first two orders were relatively small locomotives from Brooks in 1897. In 1924, a much larger locomotive was ordered, the PR-7, numbers 5-A to 2856 and weighing 127 tons. Unusually among American-built 4-8-0s, these were intended for express passenger service and therefore had much larger drivers than 4-8-0s operating in the United States, at 67 inches diameter. The cylinders had an unusually square bore and stroke of 28 x 28 inches. Because the firebox was wide and above the frames, the tops of the last set of drivers projected into the firebox, something which was only possible due to them being oil fired.

In 1935, a further five locomotives were built with larger boilers, which increased the evaporative heating surface by 357 square feet and the superheater surface by 172 square feet. These were designated PR-8, numbers 3000 to 3004. At 144 tons, the PR-8 was the heaviest conventional 4-8-0 ever built. The Norfolk &amp; Western&#x27;s M2, which is often credited as being the heaviest conventional 4-8-0, weighed less than the PR-8.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand&#x27;s first locomotive was built in the Addington Railway Workshops of the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) in 1899 and designated B class. Four more were completed that same year and one more in 1901, while Sharp, Stewart and Company built four more over the next two years. 

Ten BA class locomotives were built by the NZR at its Addington shops between 1911 and 1913, and thirty BB class locomotives were built by A &amp; G Price in New Zealand between 1915 and 1918. One each of the BA class and BB class have been preserved, BA no. 552 and BB no. 144. Both are in Auckland at the Parnell Depot of Mainline Steam, an organisation devoted to the restoration and operation of historic New Zealand Railways mainline steam locomotives. 

===Rhodesia===

Between 1899 and 1903, 52 Cape 7th Class 4-8-0 locomotives were built for the Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways (BMR) that later became a constituent part of the Rhodesia Railways (RR). These locomotives were acquired by Southern Rhodesia at the time when railways were still expanding from the Cape Colony via Bechuanaland Protectorate into Southern Rhodesia in the southwest, from Beira in Mozambique to Umtali in the east, and while the Second Boer War was still in progress. At the time, the system was composed of four smaller railways, all of them still largely under construction, that were eventually all linked up in 1902. These were the fledgling Bechuanaland Railways (BR), the Mashonaland Railways (MR), the Rhodesia Railways Northern Extensions (RRM) and the BMR. The locomotives were ordered in five batches from three British manufacturers, 24 from Neilson, Reid and Company in 1899 and 1900, eight from Kitson and Company between 1901 and 1903, and twenty from North British Locomotive Company in 1903. In 1915, five of the Neilson, Reid locomotives were sold to the South African Railways, where they were designated Class 7D.

===South Africa===
All Mastodon locomotives that saw service in South Africa were built for .
Following a decision by the Cape Government Railways (CGR) to acquire eight-coupled goods locomotives, a complete design for such a locomotive was prepared at the Salt River works in Cape Town under the supervision of Locomotive Superintendent H.M. Beatty. This became the Cape 7th Class , the legendary locomotive that played a part in the construction of a large part of the railways into the interior of Africa south of the equator.
* In 1892 and 1893, 38 of these 7th Class locomotives were delivered from Dübs and Company and Neilson and Company. In 1912 they were designated Class 7 when they were assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR).
* Between 1896 and 1901, a second batch of 46 7th Class locomotives entered service on the CGR. These had increased heating capacity. Built by Sharp, Stewart and Company, Dübs and Neilson, they were designated Class 7A on the SAR in 1912.
* Between 1899 and 1903, the Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways (BMR) in Southern Rhodesia placed 52 Cape 7th Class locomotives in service. In May 1915, five of these locomotives, all built by Neilson, Reid and Company, were sold to the SAR who designated them Class 7D.
* Between 1899 and 1904, the New Cape Central Railway (NCCR) placed seven Cape 7th Class locomotives in service on its line from Worcester to Mosselbaai in the Cape Colony, built by Neilson, Reid and North British Locomotive Company (NBL). In 1925, when the NCCR was amalgamated into the SAR, these seven locomotives were designated Class 7E.

* In 1900, the Imperial Military Railways (IMR) placed 25 Cape 7th Class locomotives in service, as well as three more that had been ordered by the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway, all built by Neilson, Reid. They all came onto the Central South African Railways (CSAR) roster at the end of the Second Boer War in 1902. In 1912, they were designated Class 7B on the SAR.
* In 1902, the CGR placed its last ten 7th Class locomotives in service. They were built by Neilson, Reid and had larger diameter boilers with a higher boiler pressure rating and larger cylinders. In 1912 they were designated Class 7C on the SAR.
* In 1913, the NCCR placed three Class 7 locomotives in service, built by NBL. They were more powerful than earlier models and also different in appearance, without the distinctive covered smokebox saddle and with running boards that dipped down ahead of the smokebox and beneath the cab. In 1925, these three locomotives were designated Class 7F on the SAR.
In 1902 and 1903, the CGR and CSAR placed a number of Cape 8th Class locomotives in service. Initially designed in 1901 as a Consolidation by H.M. Beatty, some trouble had been experienced with the leading pony trucks of the first locomotives and it was dropped in favour of a four-wheeled bogie in later orders for more locomotives.
* Altogether 23 8th Class locomotives entered service on the CGR in 1902 and 1903, built by Neilson, Reid. They had larger coupled wheels than the 7th Class, bar frames, used saturated steam and had Stephenson valve gear. In service it was found that the four wheeled bogies and the slightly shorter fixed wheelbase made them steadier and easier riding than their predecessors. In 1912, they were designated Class 8 on the SAR.
* In 1902, forty Cape 8th Class locomotives that had been ordered by the IMR a year earlier, were delivered to the CSAR from Neilson, Reid and Sharp, Stewart. They were designated Class 8-L1 on the CSAR and in 1912 they became Class 8A on the SAR.

* In 1903, when the first batch of 8th Class locomotives had been tried and proven successful, the CGR placed 38 more in service, delivered in four batches from Neilson, Reid and NBL. In 1912 they became Class 8D on the SAR.
* At the same time, the CGR ordered four additional locomotives of the 8th class. It was an experimental design built to modified specifications in order to accommodate a grate area that was increased from . They were also built by Neilson, Reid in 1903 and, in 1912, they were reclassified to Class 8E by the SAR.
* In 1903, the CSAR also placed thirty Class 8-L2 locomotives in service, built by Neilson, Reid and NBL to the specifications of the Cape 8th class, but equipped with Drummond firebox tubes. In 1912, they were designated Class 8B on the SAR.
* Also in 1903, the CSAR acquired a second batch of thirty Class 8-L3 locomotives, built by NBL. They differed from the previous thirty only by not being equipped with Drummond water tubes and were the last locomotives to be ordered by the CSAR that were built to the design of another railway. In 1912 they were reclassified to Class 8C on the SAR.
* In 1904, the CGR received its final batch of ten 8th Class locomotives from NBL. In 1912 they became Class 8F on the SAR.
* In 1930, SAR Class 8X no. 883, a  Consolidation that had been built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) for the CGR in 1902, was reboilered by the SAR with a purpose-built boiler. At the same time, it was superheated, converted to a Mastodon wheel arrangement by replacing the leading pony truck with a bogie, and reclassified to the sole Class 8R.

Because of the limited coal and water range of the existing fleet of Natal Government Railways (NGR) tank locomotives, Locomotive Superintendent D.A. Hendrie was tasked to produce a locomotive of greater power and capable of longer distances without refuelling or rewatering, to work the main line&#x27;s steep 1 in 30 gradients. The result was the NGR Class B, the first NGR tender locomotive to be built in quantity.

* Fifty Class B locomotives were delivered from NBL in 1904, the first tender locomotive fleet to be placed in service by the NGR. They had plate frames, Walschaert valve gear with Murdoch&#x27;s D slide valves, Belpaire fireboxes and used saturated steam. Six of them were modified to a  Mountain wheel arrangement in 1906 and, in 1912, the remaining 44 were designated Class 1 on the SAR.
* In 1910, the NGR placed 21 Improved Class B locomotives in service. They were built by NBL and incorporated various improvements to the original design of the Class B. Their boilers had been raised by to give a better rake on the sides of the ash pan and they were built with Hendrie&#x27;s steam reversers. In 1912, they were designated Class 1A on the SAR.
At the end of the Second Boer War, the CSAR inherited 35 Reid Tenwheeler tank locomotives from the IMR and designated them Class E. The CSAR found them to have an inadequate coal and water supply for trips of any length and, beginning in 1905, 29 of them were converted to tank-and-tender locomotives by removing the trailing bissel bogie, the fifth pair of driving wheels and the coal bunker, shortening the main frame and adding tenders reclaimed from various scrapped locomotives. In 1912, these locomotives were reclassified as Class 13 on the SAR.
In 1906, the CGR placed a single experimental 10th Class locomotive in service on the Cape Eastern System. Designed by H.M. Beatty and built by Kitson and Company, it was in most respects a larger and more powerful version of Beatty&#x27;s last Cape 8th Class of 1904, the Class 8F on the SAR. Despite its good performance, the design was never repeated since some trouble was experienced with the firebox. In 1912, it was designated Class Experimental 6 on the SAR.
Between 1926 and 1929, when a shortage of suitable shunting locomotives developed as a result of increasing traffic throughout the country and particularly on the Witwatersrand, the SAR rebuilt 21 of its Class A 4-8-2T locomotives to Class 17 tank-and-tender locomotives. They were modified by removing the trailing bissel bogie and the coal bunker, shortening the main frame and adding a tender to increase the coal and water capacity. Tenders from various scrapped locomotive types were used and they were employed as shunting engines around Durban and Port Elizabeth. In 1953, two of them were sold to the Zambezi Saw Mills Company for use on their Livingstone-Mulobezi logging railway in Northern Rhodesia. The rest were withdrawn from service by 1961, more than seventy years after the first one was built for the NGR.

===Soviet Union===
In the Soviet Union, locomotives were the first passenger engines to be built by the new state after the October Revolution. One hundred of these locomotives were built by the Putilov Works in Leningrad in 1927. Although intended for speeds up to , they proved unsteady at speed and had to be kept to slower trains. Some were built as oil-burners. Initially built as three-cylinder locomotives, they were later rebuilt as two-cylinder engines since there were apparently severe problems with the crank axle, with up to half the engines being out of service at one point due to such troubles. Boiler pressure in the two-cylinder rebuilds was raised from to and they were reclassified Mr (Мр in Cyrillic). The M class was not considered to be a great success.

===Spain===
RENFE (&quot;Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles&quot;), the Spanish rail system that was nationalised in 1941, inherited locomotives from the Madrid, Zaragoza and Alicante Railway and continued to construct the type as its 240F class and also existed 4-8-0 Steam Locomotives in the Northern, Andaluces &amp; Western Spain Railway Companies. The last survivors, all oil-burners, were concentrated at the Salamanca shed around 1970, someone Of them survived, for example Oeste 1015. 

===Sudan===

Known as the Dongola Class, Cape 7th Class locomotives were also built for the Soudan Military Railway during Kitchener&#x27;s campaign in Sudan. When he arrived in the territory in 1895, he built a railway strictly for military purposes. It ran parallel to the Nile River for nearly from Wadi Halfa to the Third Cataract at Kerma. Another line was built from Wadi Halfa across through the Nubian Desert to Atbarah and on to Khartoum to the south. For motive power, three Cape 7th Class locomotives were ordered from Neilson and Company and delivered in 1897. These were followed by five more in two batches in 1898. The locomotives were initially not numbered, but named after places in Sudan.

===Sweden===

The E9 class of Steam locomotives and its improved version the E10 were type 4-8-0 engines.
The G12 locomotives had been built for the Halmstad-Nässjö Railway and after nationalization those locomotives had ended up at SJ the state railway company and renamed E9.
SJ needed a locomotive with moderate axle weights for the Inland Railway and after being impressed with the E9 ordered an improved variant named the E10 all 10 units of which was delivered in 1947.
These were the last large steam engines built in Sweden.

===United Kingdom===
Two classes of tank locomotives were used in the United Kingdom, both built for hump shunting.

* Ten were built by the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1909 and 1910, designated the NER Class X, later the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Class T1. The LNER added a further five Class T1 locomotives in 1925. These locomotives had three cylinders, following Robinson&#x27;s design for the Class 8H of the Great Central Railway.
* In 1921, the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) built four G16 class two-cylinder tank locomotives to Urie&#x27;s design, for use in the Feltham marshalling yard.

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway both contemplated the construction of tender freight locomotives, but these never materialised.

===United States===
In the United States, the was essentially a freight locomotive that was a development of the Consolidation. Most American locomotives were built in the late 19th or early 20th century. The type never achieved great popularity, although there were five occasions when a locomotive was considered as the heaviest and/or most powerful in the world upon its introduction. Those locomotives were the no. 20 &quot;Champion&quot; of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1880, the no. 229 &quot;Mastodon&quot; of the Central Pacific Railroad in 1882, the G5 class of the Great Northern Railway in 1897 and the no. 640 of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1899. It is noteworthy that the Great Northern G5 had piston valves, as large as the pistons of many locomotives then in service.

Finally, the Duluth and Iron Range Railway ordered a number of trim-lined Mastodons, beginning in 1893, which were reportedly the heaviest freight engines constructed at the time. They had long, between-the-drivers fireboxes and a relatively short stroke for freight engines of the era. They were numbered from 60 to 89 and became the railroad&#x27;s class J. After 1900, they were gradually phased out in favor of the more conventional Consolidation type. All were scrapped by 1933.
Even though, at the time, the wide-firebox Mikado had much more potential as far as speed is concerned, the Norfolk and Western Railway opted for the class M for its shorter wheelbase that enabled it to have over 90 percent of the locomotive&#x27;s weight on the driving wheels, and the four-wheel leading truck for greater stability. The N&amp;W operated from the early 1900s to the late 1950s. Built by Baldwin Locomotive Works from 1906 and nicknamed &quot;Mollies&quot;, the class M, class M1 and class M2 became the most numerous American class of .
The class M2 locomotives are often mistakenly believed to be the largest conventional built, but the Mexican PR-8 was over four tons heavier. Many of them lasted into the 1950s, but were poor steamers since the boiler&#x27;s heating surface had been significantly increased compared to the classes M and M1, but with no corresponding improvement of firebox volume and grate area.

A total of six 4-8-0s are left to survive in the United States, Southern Pacific 2914, Norfolk and Western 433, 475, 1118, 1134, and 1151, and one of them, No. 475, continues to operate for the Strasburg Rail Road in Strasburg, Pennsylvania.

===Zambia===
In November 1953, the Zambezi Saw Mills Company (ZSM) in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia since 1964) purchased two Class 17 locomotives from the South African Railways for use on their Livingstone-Mulobezi logging railway. The company worked the teak forests that stretched to the north-west of Livingstone and it built one of the longest logging railways in the world to serve its sawmill at Mulobezi. The locomotives were scrapped between 1961 and 1963.
In 1966, two Class 7, four Class 7A and two Class 7B locomotives were also purchased by the ZSM from the SAR. These eight locomotives joined the existing fleet of eight ex Rhodesia Railways 7th Class locomotives that had been acquired by the ZSM between 1925 and 1956. After being withdrawn from service, one of the Class 7B locomotives was configured as a stationary boiler at Livingstone.

In November 1971, the ZSM also purchased one Class 8A locomotive from the SAR. This was the last locomotive to be purchased by the logging company and it was employed as a shunting engine at Mulobezi after logging operations ceased. It was returned to Livingstone in December 1975 and was eventually preserved at the Railway Museum at Livingstone.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 4-4-4 represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles, and four trailing wheels on two axles. In the United States, this arrangement was named the &quot;Reading&quot; type, since the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad was the first to use it. In Canada, this type is known as the &quot;Jubilee&quot;.

Other equivalent classifications are:
*UIC classification: 2B2 (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
*French classification: 222
*Turkish classification: 26
*Swiss classification: 2/6

==Usage==
===Bavarian Railways===
A single, experimental 4-4-4, classified as S 2/6, was built for the Royal Bavarian State Railways in 1906 by Maffei. It was successful in an experimental sense, but was too light to haul passenger trains of useful capacity. It was fast, attaining on test, and was semi-streamlined with a pointed nosecone and fairings around the cylinders, stack and dome, and slanted-back cab windows. It inspired the later Bavarian S 3/6 4-6-2 &quot;Pacifics&quot;. It passed to the Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen when the German railways were centralised, and was classified as BR 15, number 15 001. It was taken out of service in 1925, and was restored by Maffei to be exhibited at the Munich Transport Exhibition of that year. After the exhibition ended, it was placed in the Nuremberg Transport Museum, where it remains.

===Reading Railroad===
The Philadelphia and Reading Railway built four C1a Class locomotives in 1915, numbered 110 to 113. They proved to be quite unstable; after that year, they were rebuilt to 4-4-2 &quot;Atlantic&quot; locomotives, classified as P7sa, and renumbered 350 to 353.

===Baltimore &amp; Ohio===
B&amp;O created a single 4-4-4 in 1934, rebuilding a 4-4-2 &quot;Atlantic&quot; into a solitary class J-1, named &quot;Lady Baltimore&quot;. This and the single class V-2 4-6-4 &quot;Lord Baltimore&quot; were built for new lightweight passenger trains. In the &quot;Lady Baltimore&quot;&#x27;s case the Abraham Lincoln on the Chicago and Alton Railroad, a wholly owned subsidiary of the B&amp;O. Despite the Alton&#x27;s flat territory and straight track, the locomotive did not do well. It was returned to the B&amp;O and was again modified at the railroad&#x27;s Mount Clare shops, a less streamlined cab and front end being fitted. Subsequently, it was placed into local service on the railroad&#x27;s Wheeling Division, mostly operating between Holloway and Cleveland, Ohio. It proved no more successful in that service, and was sent to the B&amp;O&#x27;s Riverside Shop for storage. It was scrapped in 1949.

===Canadian Pacific===

The Canadian Pacific Railway built two classes of 4-4-4 &quot;Jubilee&quot; locomotives. Both were semi-streamlined, in a similar fashion to the 4-6-4 &quot;Royal Hudson&quot; and 2-10-4 &quot;Selkirk&quot; locomotives. The F2a was styled after the Milwaukee Road &quot;Hiawatha&quot; &quot;Atlantic&quot;, but with a four-wheel trailing truck to support a longer firebox.

Class F2a consisted of five locomotives, Nos. 3000-3004. They can be most easily distinguished from the other type through the main rods being connected to the leading pair of drivers. Some trouble was discovered with this arrangement, as they had a tendency to bend the main rods in reverse. However, they did hold the Canadian record for speed, at 112.5 mph, during a braking test. The pilot was smoothly rounded and streamlined, with two stainless-steel bands. None of this group survive.

Class F1a consisted of twenty locomotives, Nos. 2910-2929. These had the main rods connected to the trailing set of drivers, and a more regular pilot, with a straight pilot beam, a drop-coupler sheet steel pilot below that, and a more regular front deck. Two of this class of locomotive, Nos. 2928 and 2929, have survived. No. 2928 is at the Canadian Railway Museum in Delson, Quebec, while No. 2929 is at Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

===Britain===
In Britain the 4-4-4 arrangement was confined to tank locomotives and there to specific applications requiring either high speed stability in both directions (created by a symmetrical arrangement with bogies front and rear) or a powerful locomotive with as short a fixed wheelbase as possible. Eric G. Barker designed three examples for the Wirral Railway in 1896. The Midland and South Western Junction Railway purchased two 4-4-4 tank engines from Sharp, Stewart and Company but these were not a success due to their poor traction. The North Eastern Railway Class D was designed by Vincent Raven in 1913. Between 1931 and 1936 they were rebuilt with a 4-6-2T wheel layout and re-classified as A8. The H Class locomotives built for the Metropolitan Railway in the 1920s are an example of both these factors leading to a rare use of the 4-4-4 arrangement.

===Australia===
The Western Australia Government Railway N Class 4-4-4 tank locomotives were introduced in 1896.

===Hungary===
MÁVAG introduced some MÁV Class 242 4-4-4 streamlined tank locomotives between 1936 and 1939.

===India===

The Vishveshwaraiah Iron and Steel Company, Bhadravati introduced a Class-E 4-4-4 tank engine in March 1921. No. 22782 was built by the North British Locomotive Company at Atlas Works, Glasgow in 1920, the first of 23 examples. It is currently exhibited in the Railway Museum in the Mysore Junction railway station.

===Uruguay===
The &quot;D type&quot; 4-4-4T of the Central Uruguay Railway were eight locomotives (Vulcan Foundry 1913 and 1915) for use in the suburban services around Montevideo Central Station.

===Venezuela===

The 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge Gran Ferrocarril de Venezuela (&quot;Great Venezuela Railway&quot;) acquired a class of three 4-4-4T locomotives in 1892, the &quot;Cóndor&quot;, &quot;Gavilán&quot; and &quot;Halcón&quot;. They were built by Hartmann&#x27;s Sächsische Maschinenfabrik in Chemnitz, Germany. Their maximum speed was .

&quot;Halcón&quot; still exists and, after an overhaul in 1975, was in service on a heritage line until 1997. Today it is in a desolate condition.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 4-2-2 represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, two powered driving wheels on one axle, and two trailing wheels on one axle.

Other equivalent classifications are:
:UIC classification: 2A1 
:French classification: 211
:Turkish classification: 14
:Swiss classification: 1/4

Like other steam locomotive types with single pairs of driving wheels, they were also known as singles.

==History==

The 4-2-2 configuration offered designers eight wheels to spread the weight of a larger locomotive, but prior to the bogies (invented in the 1830s) becoming popular, created a long rigid wheelbase with limited adhesion. As a result, the type was relatively rare until the 1870s. The first steam locomotive made by Borsig of Berlin in 1841, the &quot;Borsig&quot; No 1, was a 4-2-2, but the company quickly reverted to the more common 2-2-2 configuration.

===UK developments===
The London and North Western Railway No. 3020 Cornwall was built as 4-2-2 at Crewe Works in 1847, but was extensively rebuilt, and converted to a 2-2-2 in 1858.
The one area where the type proved to be useful was on broad gauge locomotives, where sharp bends were less of an issue. Daniel Gooch built 29 examples of his Iron Duke express locomotive class for the Great Western Railway between 1847 and 1855. They had an diameter driving wheel size. Twenty examples of a similar design were built for the Bristol and Exeter Railway after 1849, by Stothert &amp; Slaughter in Bristol. Because both sets of leading wheels are mounted independently in the frames in these classes, they are sometimes described as (2-2)-2-2 rather than 4-2-2.

The first 4-2-2 to have a bogie was built by Archibald Sturrock of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) in 1853. This had flangeless driving wheels, and was only moderately successful, having a tendency to derail. By the 1870s, improved design of bogies giving more flexibility enabled designers to create fast standard gauge express passenger locomotives of this type. On the GNR, Patrick Stirling built 53 examples with outside cylinders at Doncaster Works between 1870 and 1895, for use on the East Coast Main Line between London King&#x27;s Cross and York. They ran at an average speed of more than during the race to the north, and were called &quot;eight-footers&quot; because of the driving wheel, that was more than in diameter. Stirling&#x27;s successor Henry Ivatt built a further twelve singles between 1898 and 1901 before moving on to larger 4-4-2 designs.

The attraction of the &#x27;single&#x27; (4-2-2 or otherwise) was that, thanks to the &#x27;gearing&#x27; effect of the large single driving wheels, a locomotive could obtain high speeds while the operating speed of the engine&#x27;s pistons and valve gear remained relatively low. This was important because of the relatively unsophisticated lubrication systems available at the time, with many of the parts of the engine&#x27;s motion requiring to be &#x27;oiled round&#x27; with the locomotive stationary before and after a run, or on longer trips by one of the crew taking to the running board to oil the required parts while on the move. Low piston speed also meant that the steam demand on the boiler would be relatively low, allowing a smaller, lighter boiler.

Before the development of the &#x27;large boiler&#x27; designs in the 1890s, many boilers could not sustain the steam supply required of a small-wheeled locomotive operating at speed, thus requiring the large driving wheels of a single. At , an &#x27;eight-footer&#x27; single&#x27;s driving wheels would be revolving at 245 revolutions per minute, opposed to the 327 revolutions of the driving wheels of a &#x27;six-footer&#x27;. A locomotive with coupled wheels also suffered extra rolling resistance from the presence of coupling rods between the driving wheels which incurred a slight but measurable resistance arising from the small variances in the diameter of the driving wheels that were nominally of the same size. This meant that without the coupling rods, for a given locomotive speed the driving wheels would turn at very slightly different rate, but the coupling rods and the axles forced the driving wheels to turn at the same speed, with the added work being incurred as a binding force in the coupling rod bearings. Aside from this force, the coupling rod bearings themselves were a source of rolling resistance. Additionally, each driving axle of a locomotive had to be supported on large plain bearings, with required further lubrication, introducing a potential point of mechanical failure through overheating and a considerable source of friction. With only one driving axle, a &#x27;single&#x27; had much less rolling resistance than a four-coupled engine, requiring less steam to achieve a given speed and also being more free-running when coasting downhill.

The 4-2-2 wheel arrangement had other specific advantages - the front bogie supported the weight of large cylinders and a long boiler which could exceed the load limits on a single front axle while also providing a superior stability and cornering at high speeds. Without restriction from a rear driving axle and wheels, a wide and deep firebox could be used, carried by the small single trailing axle, which provided good steam-making properties and a large ashpan making these locomotives suitable for running long distances at high speeds.

The Stirling &#x27;eight-footers&#x27; were very successful, but were best suited to the predominantly straight and flat GNR main line in Cambridgeshire and the Vale of York. Other railways slowly replaced their original &#x27;singles&#x27; with 4-4-0 locomotives that offered better traction at the cost of ultimate speed. However, in 1886 Francis Holt, manager at the Derby Works of the Midland Railway invented a practical form of steam sanding gear which allowed locomotive crews to quickly and effectively stop wheelspin. This led to the Midland reviving the &#x27;single&#x27; in the form of the distinctive inside-cylinder &quot;Spinners&quot;; eighty-five were built to five designs by Samuel Waite Johnson between 1887 and 1900. One 115 class, No. 673, survives at the National Railway Museum in York. Concurrent with Holt&#x27;s invention was the so-called Race to the North, when groups of railway companies on the East Coast and West Coast routes between London and Edinburgh competed with each for the fastest journey times. For its portion of the West Coast route, the Caledonian Railway used its unique 4-2-2, No. 123. This had been built in 1885 as a showpiece for the 1886 world&#x27;s fair in Edinburgh rather than to fulfil a traffic need for the railway, and so had used the now-unfashionable 4-2-2 &#x27;Single&#x27; layout. But when pressed into service during the Race to the North, No. 123&#x27;s high speed performance and reliability made other locomotive engineers reconsider the advantages of the single-driver engine, especially when joined with the new steam-sander (No. 123 had a similar sanding system working by compressed air).

These factors lead to a resurgence of interest in the &#x27;single&#x27; for fast express passenger work in the 1880s and 1890s. William Dean of the Great Western Railway built fifty examples of the standard gauge 3031 &quot;Achilles&quot; Class from 1893 to 1899. No. 3065 &quot;Duke of Connaught&quot; contributed to the record-breaking run of the &quot;Ocean Mail&quot; express train from Plymouth to Paddington in 227 minutes on 9 May 1904, when it took over the train at Bristol from No 3440 &quot;City of Truro&quot; and completed the journey to Paddington in 99 minutes 46 seconds. By 1900, average train loads had grown beyond the capability of even a sander-fitted &#x27;single&#x27; and their development was stopped. On the GNR, Stirling&#x27;s famous &#x27;eight-footers&#x27; required double heading with 4-4-0s before they were replaced by the &#x27;Klondyke&#x27; 4-4-2 engines designed by Henry Ivatt, while on the Midland Railway Samuel Johnson developed a powerful compound 4-4-0 to replace his &#x27;Spinners&#x27;.

Other notable UK examples of the 4-2-2 include the GER Class P43, which was an early oil-burning engine, developed by the pioneer of oil-boilers, James Holden. The last British &#x27;single&#x27; to be designed was the Class 13 of the Great Central Railway, designed by Harry Pollitt in 1900 for work on the company&#x27;s new main line to London. Ivatt Class A5 singles of the GNR, designed before the Great Central engines, continued to enter service during 1901, being the last of their type to take to the rails in Britain.

===US developments===

The T. D. Judah locomotive was built as a 4-2-4 by the Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works in 1863. It was purchased for use on the Central Pacific Railroad and was rebuilt as a 4-2-2 in 1872.

By 1900, typical loads on express trains had grown beyond the capabilities of 4-2-2 locomotives and the configuration was superseded by the 4-4-2.

===Asia===
In 1910, the British locomotive manufacturer Kerr, Stuart and Company produced four 4-2-2 locomotives, weighing 120 tons and with 7 ft driving wheels, for the Shanghai–Nanjing railway. These were the last recorded &#x27;singles&#x27; built and almost certainly the largest.

<text>In the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, a 2-8-8-0 is a locomotive with a two-wheel leading truck, two sets of eight driving wheels, and no trailing truck.

==Equivalent classifications==
Other equivalent classifications are:
*UIC classification: 1DD (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
*French classification: 140+040
*Turkish classification: 45+44
*Swiss classification: 4/5+4/4

The UIC classification is refined to (1&#x27;D)D for Mallet locomotives.

==Usage==
=== United States ===
The Great Northern Railway used the 2-8-8-0s as their N-1&#x27;s which were built by Baldwin in 1912. They were rebuilt by GN in 1932 as a N-2, and later re-rebuilt in 1940 as an N-3, The locomotives, after their third rebuild into a N-3, had a larger boiler and bigger tender. The N-3&#x27;s served on the GN for a collective 45 years (including previous service lives as N-1 and N-2 classes), in use until retired in 1957.

The Union Pacific Railroad also operated this type. The Union Pacific 2-8-8-0s were built in 1918 and 1924 by ALCO-Brooks. The locomotives were used to haul heavy loads over Sherman Hill on the UP. An example of one is Union Pacific #3559, which was built July 1924 by ALCO-Brooks. The locomotives were most likely retired in the late 1940s to early 1950s because of slow speeds on freight, hauling at 12 miles an hour. In comparison, the 9000 class of the Union Pacific can pull the same weight at 50 miles an hour.

Out east, the Reading Railroad had 2-8-8-0s for coal switching on Steep Hills, also known as the Reading N-1, and the Baltimore and Ohio operated this type, with the B&amp;O owning dozens of examples, most notably the EL-3 class. They were retired by the early 1950s. In the Midwest, the Kansas City Southern was a principal user of this configuration.

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was the first to use the configuration. In 1911, their own workshop took a pair of standard 2-8-0 and combined them into a 2-8-8-0 Mallet articulated locomotive. Four examples were built, but were never entirely satisfactory and were converted back to 2-8-0 in 1923. The first 2-8-8-0 operated by Baltimore and Ohio was numbered EL-1/a, which was built in 1916 at Baldwin Locomotive Works. The western end of their network had ruling gradients greater than 2%, and the 2-8-8-0 offered exceptional tractive effort, enabling a single locomotive to move the heaviest freight trains. As well as building these locomotives from scratch, the last in 1920, ten were converted from 0-8-8-0 configuration in 1920 and a further ten from 2-8-8-2 in 1922. These locomotives remained in operation until after World War II, the last being withdrawn in 1955.

No 2-8-8-0 locomotives survive today; all were scrapped. However, one tender from the 2-8-8-0 #759 of the Kansas City Southern Railroad has been preserved, while the locomotive was scrapped. It is now preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum.

=== Indonesia ===
Indonesia was also recorded operating several types of 2-8-8-0 locomotives. This dates back to the colonial era, under the government of Dutch East Indies by their state railway company named &quot;Staatsspoorwegen&quot; (SS). In the early 20th century, especially in West Java (known as Priangan), faced with the increase in passenger and freight rail traffic. By 1913, it was reported that they lacked powerful locomotives to serve the increasingly congested train traffic. This was worsened by the southern Priangan line passing through the hills requiring a special locomotive to climb the steep contour line there. The only available locomotive of the time were the 0-4-4-2T SS Class 500 (DKA BB10), 2-6-6-0T SS Class 520 (DKA CC10) and the 2-12-2T SS Class 800 (DKA F10) or known as &quot;Javanic.&quot; However, these classes were not adequate for the line, with the SS 800&#x27;s six rigidly-connected driving axles being unsuitable for the winding Priangan lines. 

This was exacerbated by the outbreak of First World War which paralyzed many industries in Europe. Amid limited choices and demands to get new locomotives immediately, SS decided to order a class of extremely large locomotives from American Locomotive Company (Alco) in 1916. In just 6 months, eight 2-8-8-0s of the first batch arrived and were classed as SS Class 1200 (1201–1208), which were the largest locomotives in the Dutch East Indies. With a total weight of 133 tons, these locomotives have the profile of large American Mallets scaled down for narrow gauge (3 ft 6 in). However, their extreme size was not proportional to their capabilities; SS was disappointed because the Class 1200 could only reach the maximum speed of which was not suitable to haul the express trains in heavy terrain with the minimum speed of . Learning from that, the 1920 batch of twelve were modified. Despite looking similar to the first batch, these weighed almost 5 tons heavier, making them the heaviest locomotives used in Java. However, their performance was not much improved from the first batch, with high fuel consumption and problems with unbalanced steam pressure (or back pressure) causing cracks in their frames, causing high operational and maintenance expenses. 

By the end of First World War, European locomotive builders were once more operational, and SS soon ordered 10 new locomotives from three manufacturers: &quot;Hanomag&quot;, &quot;Sachsische Maschinenfabrik (Hartmann)&quot; in Germany and &quot;Werkspoor, N.V.&quot; in the Netherlands, which arrived in 1923–24. These were made based on Alco design but with a large number of refinements resulting in a length and 135-ton weight, being classed as 1250 (1251–1260). While the Alco SS 1200s used bar frames, those on the European SS 1250s used plate frames. The SS 1250 was much faster, able to reach speeds of , but the problems with back pressure worsened.
Finally in 1926, the SS Experimental Service managed by de Gruijter made modifications to SS 1260. After the back pressure was fixed, a double chimney was installed to maximize the engine performance, with the power output raised to while driving at a constant speed of 45 km/h. These modifications were extended to the entire SS Class 1250s and 12 units of the second batch of SS Class 1200, while the first batch of SS 1200s was unchanged due to severe cracks in their frames. The next modification was aimed at operational efficiency; as the class requires a large amount of coal, SS trialled mechanical stokers that automatically moved coal to the firebox. However, this was called off due to increasing the axle load from 12 tons to 13 tons above the rail capacity. 

During the Great Depression in the 1930s, SS withdrew their giant locomotives to save money on fuel and in response to declining traffic. However, in 1938 these locomotives were reinstated to haul freight trains, except for the first batch of Class 1200s (which had been dismantled for parts). After the Japanese occupation and Indonesian Independence, these locos were renumbered to DD50 (first batch), DD51 (second batch) and DD52 (SS 1250s) used by &quot;Djawatan Kereta Api&quot; (DKA) or Department of Railways of the Republic of Indonesia. When the Japanese arrived in 1942, they continued to work on Purwakarta–Banjar line. 
They were nicknamed &quot;Si Gombar&quot; or The Monster by locals along with CC50 counterparts due to their size and power in the mountain lines. DD50 and DD51 were retired in the late 1960s, but DD52 lasted longer with a few of them still operational in the early 1970s. At the time, the DD52 was the only operational 2-8-8-0 locomotive in regular service in the world. Over time, the engines broke down due to poor condition and difficult maintenance, which hastened to their retirement. All examples of the class were scrapped.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, a  locomotive has two leading wheels, six coupled driving wheels and four trailing wheels.

==Overview==
With only a few known exceptions, the Adriatic wheel arrangement was usually used on tank locomotives, for which various suffixes to indicate the type of tank would be added to the wheel arrangement, for example for an engine with side-tanks.

===Tender locomotives===
The earliest known example was the South African Class 6Z, designed by Cape Government Railways (CGR) Chief Locomotive Superintendent Hazlitt Beatty in 1901. The first engines of the class were modified 2-6-2 Prairie locomotives which were equipped with two-axle trailing bogies. In 1902, more were placed in service, but built with the wheel arrangement. The latter were the first known tender locomotives in the world to be built with this wheel arrangement.

===Tank locomotives===
Tank engines with the 2-6-4T wheel arrangement were produced for many different railway systems worldwide and were mainly used for freight and suburban passenger working. They have been less successful on express passenger trains. The earliest known example also originated in South Africa, the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway&#x27;s 55 Tonner of 1898.

==Usage==
===Austria===

Two Austrian express tender locomotive types were of this wheel arrangement, the of 1908 and of 1911 designed by Karl Gölsdorf. The type therefore became known as the Adriatic arrangement, named for the Adriatic Sea which bordered Austria-Hungary.

===Brazil===
Preserved meter gauge locomotive Dona Joaninha, built to haul sugar cane in Brazil, uses the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement.

===Finland===

Finland had three locomotive classes with a 2-6-4T wheel arrangement, the Classes Vk1, Vk2 and Vk3. All three classes were nicknamed &quot;Iita&quot;.

The Class Vk1, numbered 301 to 305, were delivered in 1900 from Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Class Vk1 &quot;Iita&quot; were also nicknamed &quot;Amerikan&quot; because they were built in the United States.

The Class Vk2 were numbered 454 to 455.

The Finnish Steam Locomotive Class Vk3 were numbered 456 and 487 to 492. They were built in 1915 by Tampella, a Finnish heavy industry manufacturer, and were used for local passenger duties. One of them, Vk3 No 489, is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.
===Germany===
Two Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) 2-6-4T Class 66 locomotives, designed for fast goods train and passenger train service, were built in 1955 as part of the DB&#x27;s &quot;Neubaulok&quot; construction programme. They were both withdrawn from service in 1968. One, DB 66 002, has been preserved at the Bochum-Dahlhausen Railway Museum.

For the private TAG, which operated the railway line from Schaftlach to Tegernsee, the 2-6-4T steam locomotive &quot;TAG 8&quot; was built in 1942, using wheels from DRG Class E 79. It was in service until 1970 and has been preserved in the Bavarian Railway Museum.

===Sweden===
SJ type SB with driving wheels 1.75 m diameter for passenger use, built Motala 1917, one preserved.

SJ type J with driving wheels 1.3 m diameter for mixed traffic use, built Atlas, Motala and Nohab, 1914–1918. Four preserved.

===Switzerland===
2-6-4 tank locomotives were built by SLM in 1913 for use on the Berne-Neuenberg railway. They were still in use at Basel in 1956. Of slightly British appearance, at that time they were used to transfer stock between the French and Swiss systems, the former having not yet been electrified.

===New Zealand===
The Ferrymead Railway in Christchurch, New Zealand, has a gauge locomotive that was in regular operation until taken off-line for boiler repairs around 2009. It was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1901.

The Wf class of the New Zealand Government Railways was built between 1903 and 1928 and was a general purpose tank design. It was used all over New Zealand and identical locomotives were also in service as the Ds class of the Tasmanian Government Railways. Three Wf class locomotives survived in preservation:
* Wf386, one of the engines used on the first Wellington to Auckland train, is preserved at Paekakariki.
* Wf392 was sold to the Tasmanian Government Railways and used as a Ds class locomotive. Its boiler is on display at Don River Railway
* Wf393 is preserved at Ferrymead Railway.
* Wf403 is preserved at Nelson Railway Society.
===South Africa===

Between 1898 and 1900, the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway (PPR) placed six locomotives in service, built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company. During the Second Boer War, they were first taken over by the &quot;Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorwegmaatschappij&quot; (NZASM) and then by the Imperial Military Railways (IMR). After the war, they were taken onto the roster of the Central South African Railways (CSAR) and in 1912 they were assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR) as Class D.

In 1901, the CGR placed four 6th Class Prairie tender steam locomotives in service, designed at the Salt River works of the CGR and built by Neilson, Reid &amp; Company. During trials, it was found that they were inclined to be unsteady at speed and the locomotive design was therefore modified to a wheel arrangement by replacing the trailing carrier wheels with a two-axle bogie. Another four locomotives incorporating this modification were ordered later in 1901 and delivered in 1902, the first tender locomotives in the world to be built with this wheel arrangement. The change in design resulted in a marked improvement in the locomotive&#x27;s stability at speed and the first four locomotives were therefore also modified accordingly. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the SAR, these eight locomotives were all designated Class 6Z.

In 1902, the CGR placed two Type A Adriatic narrow gauge locomotive in construction service on the Avontuur branch, which was being built out of Port Elizabeth through the Langkloof. They were built by Manning Wardle and, at a width of , they were the widest locomotives to see service on any of the narrow gauge lines in South Africa.

===United Kingdom===
The first British examples of the 2-6-4T wheel arrangement were two locomotives built for the narrow-gauge Leek &amp; Manifold Valley Light Railway in 1904. The first examples were the class 1B of the Great Central Railway, built in 1914.

Richard Maunsell of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) designed the K class in 1914 for express passenger duties, and in 1925 introduced a three-cylinder variant K1 class for the Southern Railway. These locomotives proved to be unsteady at speed and, following the Sevenoaks railway accident in 1927, they were rebuilt as 2-6-0 tender locomotives. Maunsell did however use the type more successfully for his W class freight locomotives of 1930.
Between 1927 and 1947, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) built nearly five hundred 2-6-4Ts for suburban passenger work to four similar designs (see LMS/BR Class 4 locomotives). The last of these, the LMS Fairburn, continued to be built by British Railways (BR) until 1951. Fairburn&#x27;s LMS design also formed the basis of the very successful BR Standard Class 4, which continued to be produced until 1957.
Between 1946 and 1950, George Ivatt of the LMS also built eighteen examples of a very similar design at Derby Works, for use in Northern Ireland. These later became the Northern Counties Committee WT class.

A prototype of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) L1 class, designed by Edward Thompson, was built in 1945. The remaining 99 members of the class were built under British Railways administration during the period from 1948 to 1950.
===United States===

The Reading Company used 2-6-4T Adriatics for commuter service.

==Model railroading==
The Lionel Corporation used the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement in many of its model steam locomotives, including the 2037 used in the infamous pastel-coloured &quot;Girls&#x27; Train&quot;. Their 2-6-4 model was based on the Pennsylvania Railroad’s K4 class &quot;pacific&quot;, even though this was a 4-6-2 rather than a 2-6-4.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 2-2-2 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, two powered driving wheels on one axle, and two trailing wheels on one axle. The wheel arrangement both provided more stability and enabled a larger firebox than the earlier 0-2-2 and 2-2-0 types. This wheel arrangement is sometimes described as a [[single (locomotive)|Single]], although this name could be used to describe any kind of locomotive with a single pair of driving wheels.

==Equivalent classifications==
Other equivalent classifications are:
*UIC classification: 1A1 (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
*French classification: 111
*Turkish classification: 13
*Swiss classification: 1/3

==History==
The 2-2-2 configuration appears to have been developed by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company in 1834, as an enlargement of their 2-2-0 &quot;Planet&quot; configuration, offering more stability and a larger firebox. The new type became known as Stephenson&#x27;s Patentee locomotive. Adler, the first successful locomotive to operate in Germany, was a &quot;Patentee&quot; supplied by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company in component form in December, 1835 was one of the earliest examples. Other examples were exported to the Netherlands, Russia and Italy. By 1838 the 2-2-2 had become the standard passenger design by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company.

Eighteen of the first nineteen locomotives ordered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the opening of the Great Western Railway in 1837/8 were of the 2-2-2 type. These included six 2-2-2 locomotives built by Charles Tayleur at his Vulcan Foundry. Also in 1837 the successful &quot;North Star&quot; broad gauge locomotive was delivered to the Great Western Railway by Stephenson, becoming the first of a class of twelve locomotives by 1841.

===Later UK developments===
Sharp, Roberts &amp; Company constructed more than 600 2-2-2 locomotives between 1837 and 1857. Ten of these supplied to the Grand Junction Railway became the basis of Alexander Allan&#x27;s successful designs for the railway from 1845 (the first of which, formerly named &quot;Columbine&quot;, is preserved). John Rennie supplied 2-2-2 locomotives to the London and Croydon Railway from 1838 and the London and Brighton Railway in 1840. Arend (&quot;eagle&quot;) was one of the two first steam locomotives in the Netherlands, built by R. B. Longridge and Company of Bedlington, Northumberland in 1839.

The Great Western Railway continued to order both broad gauge and standard gauge locomotives on the railway, including the Firefly and Sun classes (1840–42), which were enlarged versions of North Star. Bury, Curtis and Kennedy supplied six 2-2-2 locomotives to the Bristol and Gloucester Railway in 1844, and fourteen to the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland in 1848, (the last of these has been preserved at Cork Kent railway station.
The Jenny Lind locomotive, designed by David Joy and built in 1847 for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway by the E. B. Wilson and Company of Leeds, became the basis of hundreds of similar passenger locomotives built during the 1840s and 1850s by this and other manufacturers for UK railways. The London and North Western Railway &quot;Cornwall&quot; locomotive was designed at Crewe Works as a 4-2-2 by Francis Trevithick in 1847, but was rebuilt as a 2-2-2 in 1858.

Although by the 1860s the 2-2-2 configuration was beginning to be superseded by the 2-4-0 type with better adhesion, the invention of steam sanding gave 2-2-2 singles a new lease of life, and they continued to be built until the 1890s. Notable late examples include William Stroudley&#x27;s singles of 1874–1880, William Dean&#x27;s 157 class of 1878–79, and his 3001 class (1891–92), both for the Great Western Railway. James Holden of the Great Eastern Railway created some 2-2-2 singles in 1889 by removing the coupling rod from a 2-4-0.

===Belgium===

The first steam railway locomotive built in Belgium in 1835, and was built by John Cockerill under license to a design by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company It was built for use on the first main line on the European mainland, the Brussels-Mechelen line. A replica was built at the workshops of Boissellerie Cognaut for the 150th anniversary of the formation of Belgium. Brussels-Mechelen line

===Italy===
Two 2-2-2 locomotives were imported from Longridge and Co of Bedlington Ironworks England for the Naples–Portici railway in 1839 named Bayard and Vesuvio. A replica of &#x27;Bayard is at the Naples Railway Museum.

===Germany===
Most of the earliest locomotives to operate in what is now Germany before the mid-1840s were 2-2-2s delivered by UK manufacturers. However, by 1839 the type was also being built locally &quot;see&quot; List of Bavarian locomotives and railbuses. The Pegasus of 1839 was the first locomotive to be built by the Sächsische Maschinenbau-Compagnie in Chemnitz. August Borsig and Company manufactured Beuth in 1843 which was highly successful; its valve design became de facto standard for locomotives for decades to come. By 1846 he had manufactured more than a hundred similar locomotives. Both the Leipzig-Dresden Railway and Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn) built several 2-2-2 classes 1841-1859. Similarly, the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway grouped various 2-2-2 steam locomotives procured from German manufacturers between 1848 and 1863 into its Mecklenburg I class.

===Austria===
The Imperial Austrian State Railways (kaiserlich-königliche österreichische Staatsbahnen or kkStB) built two successful locomotives of this wheel arrangement in 1907. Similarly the Federal Railway of Austria (BBÖ) built two examples of an express tank locomotive in 1934 and 1937.

===Latvia===
One of last 2-2-2 tank locomotives were ordered by Latvian Railways, for local traffic. The locomotives Tk class were designed by German Hohenzollern, and 20 were manufactured in Germany and Latvia in 1928-1934. They were next seized by Soviet railways. After World War II one served in Poland as OKa1 class.

<text>In the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotive wheel arrangement, an 0-4-4-0 is a locomotive with no leading wheels, two sets of four driving wheels, and no trailing wheels. The arrangement is chosen to give the articulation of a locomotive with only the short rigid wheelbase of an , but with its weight spread across eight wheels, and with all the weight carried on the driving wheels; effectively a flexible . Articulated examples were constructed as Mallet, Meyer, BMAG and Double Fairlie locomotives and also as geared locomotives such as Shay, Heisler, and Climax types. A similar configuration was used on some Garratt locomotives, but it is referred to as . In the electric and diesel eras, the Bo-Bo is comparable and closest to the Meyer arrangement of two swivelling bogies.

Although rigid duplex locomotives were also constructed with pairs of driving axles and the 0-4-4-0 driven arrangement, these were intended for express passenger service and so were given overall arrangements with leading and trailing bogies for stability.

A few Mallet locomotives were built as 0-4-4-0 tender locomotives, mostly by Baldwin for narrow gauge lines, but all others were 0-4-4-0T tank locomotives. As one of the main goals of this arrangement was to place the most adhesion weight on the drivers, it was sensible to include the weight of coal and water with this.

== Equivalent classifications ==
Other equivalent classifications are:
*UIC classification: (also known as German classification and Italian classification) would be BB for a rigid duplex, but usually B′B for a Mallet locomotive or B′B′ for a Meyer or Fairlie.
*French classification: 020+020
*Turkish classification: 22+22
*Swiss classification: 2×2/2

== Development ==
The first four-wheeled double-bogie locomotives were built by Horatio Allen in 1832. These were four double-boilered locomotives built by the West Point Foundry in New York for the
South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company, the first of these named &quot;South Carolina&quot;. Although these had many of the features that would later become known as typical for Fairlies, the articulated bogies and the double boiler, the wheels of these bogies were not coupled and so they were instead of a wheel arrangement. The &#x27;double boiler&#x27; in this case also meant two narrow boiler barrels side by side at each end, four in total, not just double-ended.

The first 0-4-4-0 locomotive was the , one of the contestants in the 1851 Semmering Trials. The Semmering railway was the world&#x27;s first mountain railway and faced unprecedented gradients of 2.5%. This required the development of new techniques in locomotive design for which trials were held and the entrants used various forms of articulation in order to place the most useful power through their driving wheels. &quot;Seraing&quot; resembled what would become the double Fairlie design, with a double boiler and two articulated powered bogies beneath the frame.

After Semmering, some French engineers also experimented with duplex drive locomotives. Jules Petiet, designed some unsuccessful classes of rigid duplexes with an (UIC: A3A) single-boiler but double-ended Crampton in 1862 and a class of twenty s in 1863. Thouvenot in 1863 produced an design which was closer to the Fairlie type, with a double boiler and swivelling bogies.

=== Meyer locomotives ===

The first Meyer locomotive, &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;, was built in 1861 and was also derived from a Semmering Trials design, the . This had a similar arrangement of two power bogies to &quot;Seraing&quot;, but a conventional single boiler. Meyer used compounding at first and so the cylinders were placed at the inner end of the bogies, where the intermediate pressure pipework between them could be kept shorter.

The most numerous Meyer locomotives were a German narrow gauge class, the DRG Class 99.51–60, of which 96 were built.

The need to place the boiler above the bogies limited the depth of the firebox. W. G. Bagnall worked around this by using their own boiler design with an internal firebox within the circular shell.

=== Fairlie locomotives ===

A decade after &quot;Seraing&quot;, Robert Fairlie revived the concept and was granted a patent for his design in 1864. It is not known how aware Fairlie was of the other European attempts. Placing the cylinders at the outer ends of the power bogies left a space between them and allowed depth for a conventional firebox, grate and ashpan.

The first Fairlie was an 0-4-4-0T built for the Neath and Brecon Railway in 1866, but the design came to prominence in 1869 with &quot;Little Wonder&quot; for the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales followed by five others. One locomotive was supplied to the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1872. The type was also used in Mexico, New Zealand and Russia on Transcaucasian Railway.

==== Survivors ====
There are five examples of surviving Fairlie 0-4-4-0T locomotives on the Ffestiniog Railway. Two of these are survivors from the original 19th century line; &quot;Merddin Emrys&quot; is still in service. Three were built new during the preservation era, the latest &quot;James Spooner&quot;, was completed in 2023.

&quot;Josephine&quot;, a Vulcan Foundry-built Double Fairlie, built in 1872 for the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway Company, survives as a static exhibit in Dunedin, New Zealand.

=== Péchot-Bourdon locomotives ===
These were a small Fairlie in all but name, with a few differences to allow a French patent to be granted in 1887. They were employed over short distances in French military railways.

=== Mallet locomotives ===

The most numerous 0-4-4-0 locomotives were the Mallet design. These are articulated compound locomotives. The rear wheels and cylinders were fixed to the frames, as for a conventional locomotive. The front set formed a bogie that was pivoted at its rear and supported the front of the boiler on a sliding pad. As a compound, the lower pressure cylinders were always the swivelling bogie, as this only required the lower intermediate pressure to be passed through the pivoting steam pipe. The first of these was for a Decauville light railway in 1887. Like the Fairlies, these were intended for narrow gauge lines built with tight curves. The most numerous 0-4-4-0T and 0-4-4-0TT Mallets were small locomotives of 600 mm and gauge built for the Javan sugar plantations in the 1900s and 1910s by companies like Orenstein &amp; Koppel and the Dutch Du Croo &amp; Brauns, some of which were still operating into the 21st century.
Switzerland persisted with the 0-4-4-0T and 0-4-4-0 types and in the 1890s J.A. Maffei built classes of each for the standard gauge Swiss Central Railway.

The Mallet type developed and outgrew the original wheel arrangement, particularly in the USA, also gaining tenders and often being simple expansion engines rather than compounds.

== Eritrean Railways ==

Eritrean Railways used many 0-4-4-0Ts. The last was built in their own shops in 1963, making it the last Mallet built in the world.

From 1911, Italian State Railways built at least twelve gauge Mallets as the class. These were used on the until the end of the 1920s, when they were relocated to Italian colonies in Eritrea.

<text>James Henry Hackett (March 15, 1800 – December 28, 1871) was an American actor.
Hackett was born in New York City. He entered Columbia College in 1815 but withdrew. He then studied law privately. In 1818, he became a wholesale clerk in a grocery firm in New York. In 1819, he married Catherine Leebuff, a young actress. After an unsuccessful entry into business, he went on the stage in March 1826 playing the role of Justice Woodcock in &quot;Love of a Village&quot;. He played opposite his wife in the play. He soon established a reputation as a player of eccentric character parts. The next year, he played at the Covent Garden in London with success. He traveled back and forth between the United States and Britain, achieving a reputation in the works of Shakespeare, particularly Falstaff. In 1834 he commissioned a play from writer John Neal to suit his strength with eccentric characters but rejected the comedy upon receipt.

As a manager and impresario, he is remembered, among other things, for having engaged the troupe of Italian opera singers who formed the nucleus of the first season (1854–55) of the Academy of Music in New York City. After that, he appeared only rarely on the public stage.
He was the author of &quot;Notes and Comments on Shakespeare&quot; (1863).

He was the father of Recorder John K. Hackett and actor James Keteltas Hackett.

Hackett died on December 28, 1871, in Jamaica, Long Island, New York.

<text>Sé is a parish in the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo on the island of Terceira in the Azores. The population in 2011 was 955, in an area of 1.65 km². It is one of the smallest parishes in Angra do Heroísmo.

==History==

Designated the island of Jesus Christ (&quot;Ilha de Jesus Cristo&quot;), at the time of its discovery and exploration by Portuguese navigators: the settlement of Terceira began around 1450, when it was conceded to the Fleming Jácome de Bruges, by Infante D. Henrique. The first settlers to the island disembarked in the areas of Porto Judeu and Pria, and slowly extended throughout the island.

In the hilltop of Monte Brasil is the Fort of São João Baptista (also known as the Fort of São Filipe), built at the beginning of the era of Castilian occupation of the archipelago. It was constructed with the intention of being a potent fortress, to guard the riches and circulation of European shipping into the Americas. This castle, with its high walls and grande scale, was constructed from the middle of the 16th century and first half of the following century. During the period of the Portuguese Restoration War, which began with the revolution of 1 December 1640, and ended with the peace of 1668, forces loyal to the Spanish resisted the Portuguese. It was only two years later, in 1642, that the Spanish rendered and the city of Angra were, in fact, freed.

The name &quot;Sé&quot; came from the topological name for the religious administrative territory governed by the diocesan cathedral in Angra: Sé is the location of the only cathedral in the archipelago of the Azores.

==Geography==

Situated on the island of Terceira, the civil parish of Sé, along with the surrounding parishes constitute the city of Angra do Heroísmo, seat of the municipality.

==Economy==
Many of the economic activities in the parish are related to commerce and service sectors, since the island is a primary destination for tourism.

* Episcopal Palace of Angra do Heroísmo (), former 16th century manorhouse, used as the residence of the Bishop of Angra over the centuries, eventually converted and reused in the public sector.

===Religious===
* Sé Cathedral (), built after 1570, over the ruins of the 15th century Church of the Divino Salvador, which were severely damaged. Destroyed by violent earthquakes, in the 18th century the Sé of Angra was reconstructed in accord with the Mannerist principals of the 16th century. Its main facade included two two-story bell-towers, linked by a pediment with central clock and iron cross.

<doc id="1303834" wikidata="Q3997705" url="?curid=1303834" title="West Highland Free Press">
<text>The West Highland Free Press was founded in the Scottish Highlands in 1972 as a left-wing weekly newspaper, but with the principal objective of providing its immediate circulation area with the service which a local paper is expected to provide. It is based at Broadford on the Isle of Skye, covering Skye, Wester Ross and the Outer Hebrides.

==Content and columnists==

The paper&#x27;s priorities are summarised in the Gaelic slogan on its masthead: &quot;&quot;&quot; – The Land, the Language, the People&quot;. It is a slogan borrowed from the Highland Land League which, in the late 19th century, fought crucial battles to win security of tenure for crofters.

The land issue is at the heart of the &quot;Free Press&quot; politics. The paper perceives a fundamental conflict of interest in private landlordism (which persists to the present), and this is reflected in many of the most celebrated stories which it has reported. It has championed the cause of community land ownership with considerable impact upon public policy including the establishment of a Scottish Land Fund and a Community Land Unit at Highland Enterprise in the late 1990s. The paper has also advocated community co-operatives and other locally based forms of economic development.

The &quot;Free Press&quot; has consistently championed the cause of the Gaelic language, both by giving it political support and by publishing written Gaelic material. The &quot;Press&quot; has also reported and campaigned on environmental-impact stories such as the construction of a private-enterprise tollbridge to Skye. It has also supported renewable energy though this has recently proved to be a controversial stance, particularly on the Isle of Lewis. Though generally supportive of the Labour Party, it has also criticised Labour governments on issues such as crofting reform and has played a major part in shaping political debate in the West Highlands and Islands.

The &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot; has seen a number of notable columnists, including Professor Donald MacLeod, former principal and leading theologian of the Free Church of Scotland College in Edinburgh, Angus Peter Campbell, the award-winning Gaelic writer and award-winning novelist Roger Hutchinson. The paper&#x27;s founding editor, Brian Wilson, was also a regular contributor since retiring from politics as a Labour MP and British government minister.

The &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot; is available extensively within the West Highlands and Islands and in towns and cities throughout Scotland, each Friday. The full paper is now also available by subscription on the internet. In 2013, it had a weekly circulation of over 7,500.

=== Sacking of Donald Macleod ===

Regular contributor Donald Macleod wrote a 22 May 2015 column on a future &quot;Islamic dominance in Britain&quot;. He argued that, while minority groups fit in with the majority, that this would alter once Muslims formed majorities in the UK, saying:&quot;West Highland Free Press&quot; Editor Ian McCormack required Macleod to &quot;moderate his language&quot;, MacLeod refused and resigned. Brian Wilson was then sacked for writing a column criticising his former colleagues. Broadcaster and columnist Maggie Cunningham also left the title in protest.

Editor McCormack later suggested he had made &quot;a serious error of judgement&quot; and was following his worker-owner colleagues&#x27; intentions. He made &quot;no apology&quot; for Wilson&#x27;s sacking. While he &quot;share[ed] many of the views he expressed&quot; he felt the column was a breach of trust, due to its criticism of the paper&#x27;s owners.

Free speech groups attacked the sacking, while human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar condemned the column as &quot;Islamophobic&quot; lacking in &quot;Jesus&#x27;s encouragement to &#x27;turn the other cheek&#x27;&quot;.

==Awards==

The newspaper has often won awards at the Highlands and Islands Media Awards. In 2012 this included Journalist of the Year, Sports Writer of the Year, Photographer of the Year. In previous years they have also picked up Newspaper of the Year, Website of the Year, Feature Writer of the Year, Gaelic Columnist of the Year, Reporter of the Year.

==Employee ownership==
On 27 October 2009 the &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot; became the only employee-owned newspaper in the United Kingdom. The newspaper celebrated its 40th anniversary in April 2012. The newspaper&#x27;s managing director, Paul Wood, is also a board member with Co-operative Development Scotland, the Scottish Government subsidiary promoting employee-ownership, collaboration and mutualism within Scotland.

<doc id="1303837" wikidata="Q491491" url="?curid=1303837" title="Gradus ad Parnassum">
<text>The Latin phrase &#x27; means &quot;a step towards Parnassus&quot;. It is sometimes shortened to &#x27;. &quot;Parnassus&quot; is the prominence of a mountain range in central Greece, a few kilometres north of Delphi, of which the two summits, in Classical times, were called &quot;Tithorea&quot; and &quot;Lycoreia&quot;. In Greek mythology, one of the peaks was sacred to Apollo and the nine Muses, the inspiring deities of the arts, and the other to Dionysus. The phrase came to be used by authors of various books of instruction with the aid of which &quot;gradual&quot; progress and mastery in an art or scholarly discipline is sought.

==Classics==
The first application of the phrase is to a kind of Latin or Greek dictionary, in which the quantities of the vowels are marked in the words, to help beginners to understand the principles of Latin verse composition, in relation to the values of the metrical feet.

The &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; made famous under the name of Jesuit Paul Aler (1656–1727), a schoolmaster, published in 1686, presented anew an earlier Thesaurus attributed to Pierre Joulet, sieur de Chastillon (1545–1621). This was not a general dictionary but a thesaurus of synonyms, epithets, verses and phrases in classical poetic usage. The work in Alers&#x27; form existed into the 19th century with the definitions as well as the entries written in Latin. Known to many generations of students throughout Europe, and passing through numerous editions, 19th century English-speaking schoolchildren knew the 1818 revision by Dr John Carey (1756–1826) simply as &#x27;Carey&#x27;s Gradus&#x27;. It was specially intended for the study and appreciation of Latin poetry of the classical period, and to aid students in the practice of verse composition. There is also a Latin gradus by C.D. Yonge (1850); English-Latin by AC Ainger and HG Wintle (1890); Latin-French by F.J.M. Noël (1810); Greek by Thomas Morell (1762, new ed. ed. by E. Maltby, Bishop of Durham, 1815); John Brasse (1828).

The large general dictionaries of Greek and Latin adopted this pattern of information. For example, the Liddell-Scott-Jones &quot;Greek-English Lexicon&quot; (1843) and its current derivatives give quantity information where it is crucial and where it is available; so do Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short&#x27;s &quot;A Latin Dictionary&quot; (1879) and its derivatives. The synonyms, epithets, poetical expressions and extracts became incorporated under the more important headings.

===Yonge===
Charles Duke Yonge published &quot;A gradus ad Parnassum: For the use of Eton, Westminster, Harrow, and Charterhouse schools, King&#x27;s college, London, and Marlborough college&quot; in 1850 a work that was still in print in 1902, by then titled &quot;...For the use of Eton, Westminster, Harrow, Charterhouse and Rugby schools, King&#x27;s college, London, and Marlborough college&quot; and bound with &quot;A Dictionary of Epithets: Classified according to their English meaning&quot;.

==Music and art==
Works entitled &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; include:
* a seminal textbook on counterpoint written by Johann Joseph Fux in 1725, still used today for instruction in musical theory and composition; Leopold Mozart is said to have taught his son Wolfgang from its pages. Beethoven held it in great esteem, and Haydn meticulously worked out each of its exercises.
* a collection of 100 instructional piano pieces by Muzio Clementi
* a collection of instructional piano pieces by Carl Czerny
* a collection of instructional violin studies by Ernst Heim
* a series of pedagogical works for violin by Jakob Dont
* a collection of 24 double bass studies by Franz Simandl
* a collection of pedagogical studies for violin by Émile Sauret
* a collection of pedagogical studies for harmonium by Sigfrid Karg-Elert
* a piano sonatina by Hanns Eisler
* an album cd or streaming from 2023 by harpsichord player Jean Rondeau

&quot;Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; is a satirical piano composition by Claude Debussy, from his suite &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;, poking fun at one or the other of these sets of exercises (Czerny&#x27;s, according to Myriam Chimènes&#x27;s notes to the Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli version).

Samuel Coleridge-Taylor wrote a nonet, his Op. 2, subtitled &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot;, not as a pedagogical work but to display composition skills while he was a student at London&#x27;s Royal College of Music.

&quot;Ad Parnassum&quot; is a significant painting in the divisionist style by Paul Klee.

Since the year 2000, the name Gradus ad Parnassum was incorporated as the name of a small music school in New Jersey, Gradus ad Parnassum Inc.

<doc id="1303846" wikidata="Q4766402" url="?curid=1303846" title="Ann Flood">
<text>Ann Flood (born Maryanne Elizabeth Ott; November 12, 1932 – October 7, 2022) was an American actress, best known for her role as journalist and author Nancy Pollock Karr in the soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, a role she began in 1962. Flood portrayed the show&#x27;s heroine for 22 years, witnessing the show&#x27;s transition from live to taped broadcasts and its move from CBS to ABC.

==Early years==
Flood was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York, the daughter Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ott. She graduated from Bay Shore High School with a scholarship in merchandising and buying to a junior college in New England, but a summer job changed her plans. She worked as a receptionist at a beach club where many of the members were actors who put on shows for the community. One of them invited her to take a small part in a play, and that sparked Flood&#x27;s interest in acting. She took lessons from a dramatic coach and began to learn more about the profession from other actors. She said that changing her name for acting was &quot;purely psychological. Maryanne Ott is not as euphonious as Ann Flood.&quot;

==Career==

Flood had notable roles on Broadway, making her debut in the 1954 musical &quot;Kismet,&quot; in which she began as a show girl but was promoted to a singing part when two cast members became sick. She went on to play opposite Don Ameche in &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot; (1957). Her television debut came earlier, in a 1952 live production of the W. S. Gilbert play, &quot;The Fortune Hunter&quot;, for WOR-TV.

Flood became a regular performer on golden age live TV shows, including &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, and &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;. She was also known for roles in various commercials, including those for Good Seasons salad dressing, Newport cigarettes, Ivory Snow detergent, and Sterling beer. Before starting on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, she played the leading role of another journalist, Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Fraser Allen in the soap opera &quot;From These Roots&quot; (1958–61).

In &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, Nancy&#x27;s marriage to Mike Karr remains as one of the longest in soap history. Nancy and Mike had no children of their own, but the character of Laurie (Mike&#x27;s daughter by his first wife Sara) came to consider Nancy as her mother. Flood continued in the role through the series&#x27; finale in 1984, by which time she was the show&#x27;s longest-serving cast member.

For her work on the show, Flood was twice nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, in 1982 and 1984.

After &quot;Edge of Night&quot;, Flood continued to act in daytime dramas. She was cast in a succession of shorter-term and recurring roles, playing Ella Hobbs, a villain on &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, who tried to kill the show&#x27;s leading character, Joanne, and played a variety of society matrons on &quot;Another World&quot; (Rose Livingston, 1986–1987), &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (Mrs. Guthrie, 1991), and &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, recurring from 1992 to 1993 as business executive Ruth Mansfield. In 1987, she joined the cast of &quot;All My Children&quot; playing the recurring role of Bitsy Davidson, Cecily&#x27;s snooty mother, and was briefly under contract to the show. Her last appearance aired in January 1990.

Other work included guest-starring roles in prime-time TV programs such as &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, and a role in the 1988 feature film, &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Flood was married since 1952 to sportscaster and media network executive Herb Granath until his death in 2019. She had three sons and one daughter.

Flood died in Stamford, Connecticut, on October 7, 2022, five weeks before her 90th birthday.

<text>Louny (; ) is a town in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 18,000 inhabitants. It lies on the Ohře river. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Louny consists of three municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Louny (17,318)
*Brloh (143)
*Nečichy (102)

Brloh forms an exclave of the municipal territory.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Louny is unclear. Older theories, which are less likely, link the name to the personal name Lún, to the Czech word &quot;lůno&quot; (literally &#x27;womb&#x27;, but here meaning &#x27;valley&#x27;), to the bird &quot;luňák&quot; (i.e. &#x27;kite&#x27;), or even to the Celtic word &quot;louwn&quot; (&#x27;lawn&#x27;). More modern and more likely theories attribute the origin of the name to the Old Czech words &quot;lunúti&quot; (&#x27;to flow fast&#x27;) and &quot;lúňa / lúna&quot; (&#x27;current&#x27;), which refer to the local flow of the Ohře River.

==Geography==
Louny is located about southeast of Ústí nad Labem and northwest of Prague. It lies mostly in the Lower Ohře Table, but a small northern part of the municipal territory extends into the Central Bohemian Uplands and includes the highest point of Louny at above sea level. The Ohře River flows through the town.

==History==
Already at the turn of the 11th–12th centuries there was a settlement named &quot;Luna&quot;, located on the site of today&#x27;s Church of Saint Peter. The first written mention of the settlement is from 1115, when it was a property of Kladruby Abbey. In the 1260s, a royal town was founded at its place by King Ottokar II. It was located on two important traffic routes, river Ohře and the road from Prague to Nuremberg. Together with the town a Benedictine monastery was founded, but it was destroyed during the Hussite Wars.

The town rapidly developed in the 15th century, when Church of Saint Peter, Church of the Mother of God and town fortifications were built. After a fire in 1517, the town was severely damaged and had to be rebuilt, and a new church (Church of Saint Nicholas) was built.

During the 19th century and then in the 1960s and 1970s, there was extensive demolitions in the historical town and many valuable Renaissance houses and parts of town fortifications were destroyed. The economic development of Louny occurred in the second half of the 19th century, when railway repair shops, sugar factory, brewery, slaughterhouses, mills and financial institutions were founded. After 1945, industrialisation of Louny continued.

Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, in the district of the same name, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The town lies on a railway junction and a factory for overhauling railway engines and rolling stock, later known as &quot;Heavy Machinery Services&quot;, was established in 1873. It was a major employer and contributed to the town&#x27;s expansion during the early 20th century. The company was the town&#x27;s largest employer until 2014, when it went bankrupt. Since 2019, the industrial complex is rented to the DAKO-CZ company, which is a brake system manufacturer for rolling stock.

Other industries include a brewery (from the hops which are grown in the region) and a factory making porcelain electrical insulators for power cables. The largest employer with headquarters in Louny is Fujikoki Czech company, producer of thermostatic expansion valves used in car air conditioners.

==Transport==
Several railway lines run through Louny: Most–Rakovník, Česká Lípa – Postoloprty and Louny – Kralupy nad Vltavou. The town is served by three train stations.

==Sights==
The most important architectural feature is Roman Catholic Church of Saint Nicholas, built in the late Gothic style in 1519–1538. One of the architects was Benedikt Rejt. It incorporates a tower from an earlier church which was otherwise destroyed along with most of the town by a major fire in 1517. Other significant churches in the town are Church of Saint Peter from the 14th–15th century, Church of the Mother of God from 1493 and Church of the Fourteen Holy Helpers from 1716.

The historic centre of Louny forms Mírové Square and its surroundings. The town hall on the square is a Neo-Renaissance building from 1887. The most valuable building on the square is a Renaissance house, today the seat of the district archive.

Parts of the town ramparts remain, as does the Žatec Gate which dates from 1500.

<doc id="1303851" wikidata="Q48700266" url="?curid=1303851" title="The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar">
<text>The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar (sometimes written as ...featuring Bachir Attar) are a collective of Jbala Sufi trance musicians, serving as a modern representation of a centuries-old music tradition. The collective includes musicians from the village of Jajouka (sometimes spelled as Joujouka or Zahjouka), in the Rif Mountains of northern Morocco. Most members are the sons of previous members, and adopt the surname &quot;Attar&quot; (&quot;perfume maker&quot;).

== History ==
The original Master Musicians of Joujouka were first documented by Western journalists in the early 1950s. In the early 1990s, the collective split into two factions, as first reported by visiting musician Lee Ranaldo. One collective retained the name &quot;The Master Musicians of Joujouka&quot;. Meanwhile, the faction led by Bachir Attar, whose father had led the group in the late 1960s, took on the name &quot;The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar&quot;. Bachir Attar&#x27;s group attracted protests at concerts in the United Kingdom, and international journalists noted that the schism created discord in the collective&#x27;s home village. Other journalists and fans conceded that both groups were working to preserve their ancient musical heritage.

Bachir Attar&#x27;s group released the album &quot;Apocalypse Across the Sky&quot; in 1992, produced by Bill Laswell. &quot;Jajouka Between the Mountains&quot; followed in 1996, produced by Tchad Blake; and &quot;Master Musicians of Jajouka Featuring Bachir Attar&quot;, produced by Talvin Singh, was released in 2000. The album, &quot;The Road to Jajouka&quot;, was released in 2014 and featured guest appearances by Ornette Coleman, John Medeski, Flea, DJ Logic, Lee Ranaldo, Bill Laswell, and many others.

<doc id="1303857" wikidata="Q5357821" url="?curid=1303857" title="Energy liberalisation">
<text>Energy liberalisation refers to the liberalisation of energy markets, with specific reference to electricity generation markets, by bringing greater competition into electricity and gas markets in the interest of creating more competitive markets and reductions in price by privatisation. As the supply of electricity is a natural monopoly, this entails complex and costly systems of regulation to enforce a system of competition.

A strong drive for liberalisation occurred in European Union energy markets at the turn of the millennium, directed by European Commission directives favouring market liberalisation promulgated in 1996, 2003, and 2009. These programmes were supported with the interest of increasing the interconnectedness of European energy markets and building the common market. Similar initiatives, to varying degrees, have been pursued in nations around the world, such as Argentina, Chile, and the United States.

==British model==
A standard model for electricity liberalisation is the &quot;British model&quot;, a reform plan which consists of six reforms: (1) creation of a competitive market for electricity, (2) the breakup of monopolized supply such that each consumer can select their provider, (3) separation of network maintenance from generation, (4) separation of direct supply from the generation of electricity, (5) creation of an incentive structure to set market prices in monopolistic competition, and (6) the privatisation of formerly state-owned assets. It was implemented under the Thatcher years as part of a mass privatisation campaign of many of the industries nationalised by previous Labour governments in the preceding decades. The risks involved for both generators and distributors have led to vertical re-integration.

==Benefits of liberalisation==
Proponents of liberalisation assert that the main benefit comes from the increased competition afforded to the market. This would increase the availability and distribution of energy in supply situations by building transparent price signals and diversifying the production of electricity between gas-turbine technologies to nuclear energy. It would also lead to the elimination of unnecessary overhead supply in formerly nationalised markets, allowing for capital resources to be utilised more effectively on things such as network infrastructure instead of maintaining idle power stations. These increases in efficiency have led to lower prices paid by consumers in nations, such as the United Kingdom, which have more heavily pursued deregulation.

The creation of pooled energy sources per the British model and other systems adopted in Chile and Texas have led to greater demand price-response, allowing for the more efficient use of electricity and increasing the response of consumers to prices so fewer costs are afforded to them. Furthermore, the greater interconnectedness of networks has allowed for markets to be more able to respond to peak energy demand and thereby increase the security of energy networks.

==Problems with liberalisation==
Liberalisation of electricity tends to substantially benefit large consumers (mainly industrial users), but benefits for domestic consumers compared with a public monopoly or a regulated private monopoly are questionable, as liberalisation has been shown to pass on supply costs onto consumers. There are also doubts over whether the system can ensure long-term security of supply through providing sufficient incentives to begin building generation capacity in time for when it is needed, an issue which has started to plague Britain in the mid-2010s as spare capacity has decreased significantly to just over 1.2 percent in 2015.

Furthermore, the experience of electricity liberalisation in developing countries has proven problematic, as many large multinationals withdrew support for power plant construction projects in the start of the 21st century, leaving countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uganda to pick up the bill for the expansion of their electric networks. The privatisation of electricity favoured by liberal economists mirroring the British model have also led to increased expenditure on advertising and power switching incentives for consumers.

The nature of the natural monopoly coming from electricity generation is also an issue which has gone unaddressed. Because of the monopolistic competition inherent to the energy market, there are significant issues with collusion by firms to raise prices. To prevent these issues as well as those associated with direct intervention to build new generation capacity, governments have had to step in to further regulate and build such capacity directly, effectively defeating the point of liberalisation. These issues have been compounded with growing geopolitical instability in Eastern Europe and concerns over gas pipelines in Ukraine.

== Europe ==
In the European Union, a strong policy of liberalisation of the European energy markets was pursued by the European Commission in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century. The first liberalisation directive for the electricity markets was adopted in 1996 and for the gas markets in 1998. The next directives were adopted in 2003. It was replaced by Directive 2009/72/EC of 13 July 2009, following a proposal by the European Parliament and the European Council in 2007 concerning separation of supply and generation or production activities.

An analysis of PSIRU states that it seems that the European Commission&#x27;s liberalisation directives were motivated more about taking control of electricity from national governments, creating large European electricity companies that can compete strongly in the world market and destroying nationally owned monopoly companies, rather than a belief in the market.

<text>So Long a Letter () is a semi-autobiographical epistolary novel originally written in French by the Senegalese writer Mariama Bâ. It was her first novel. Its theme is the condition of women in Western African society.

As the novel begins, Ramatoulaye Fall is beginning a letter to her lifelong friend Aissatou Bâ. The occasion for writing is Ramatoulaye&#x27;s recent widowhood. As she gives her friend the details of her husband&#x27;s death, she recounts the major events in their lives.

The novel is often used in literature classes focusing on women&#x27;s roles in post-colonial Africa. It won the first Noma Award for Publishing in Africa in 1980.

==Plot summary==
&quot;So Long a Letter&quot; is written as a series of entries in a long letter from the main character Ramatoulaye Fall to her best friend Aissatou following the sudden death from heart attack of Ramatoulaye&#x27;s husband Modou Fall. The letter is written while Ramatoulaye is going through &#x27;Iddah, a four month and ten day mourning process that widow of the Muslim Senegalese culture must follow. Ramatoulaye begins by recalling and describing the emotions that flooded her during the first few days after her husband&#x27;s death and speaks in detail about how he lost his life. She transitions the tone and time by discussing the life she had with her husband, from the beginning of their relationship to his betrayal of a thirty year marriage by secretly marrying his daughter&#x27;s school best friend to the life he had with his second wife. Throughout this short and compelling novel, Ramatoulaye details to Aissatou, who experienced a similar but different marital situation, how she emotionally dealt with and was changed by his betrayal, his death, and by being a single mother of many.

== Analysis ==
The letter covered many topics such as polygamy, Senegalese class hierarchy, and religion, so it was difficult to place the genre of the book. Some called it a novel while others referred to Bâ&#x27;s work as a letter.

Author and professor Uzoma Esonwanne interpreted the book as a challenge to colonialism while also acknowledging colonial practices. The character Ramatoulaye&#x27;s insistence on being heard and providing inside commentary on the downside of polygamy, made Esonwanne question the part gender plays in this new era of the world.

Author and Yale professor Christopher L. Miller found Bâ&#x27;s &quot;So Long a Letter&quot; more journal-like, in that it held her written letter with no one answering back.

Literary scholar Abiola Irele called it &quot;the most deeply felt presentation of the female condition in African fiction&quot;.

==Reception==
The letter was used in the western hemisphere to study how strong bonds women formed influenced them. Ramatoulaye and Aissatou&#x27;s friendship helped them break away from social norms, gaining social and political respect without a male.

The letter was also used to understand women&#x27;s views on polygamy. Some women in Senegal saw fault in polygamy and fought against it.
Aissatou leaves her husband for practising polygamy and Ramatoulaye says no to marriage to another man.

The author was praised for her involvement in expanding African literature as well as feminism through personal accounts of her life.

== Themes ==
&quot;So Long a Letter&quot; deals with multiple themes, which includes the life of women in Senegal during the 1970s, family and community life, Islam and polygamy, and death rituals.

The letters explore the tensions between Ramatoulaye&#x27;s feminist values (developed largely as a consequence of her French colonial education) and her religion, which is often used a means of justifying the mistreatment of women like herself. However, Ramatoulaye attributes the mistreatment of women by men to the misinterpretation and misappropriation of Islamic scriptures, rather than suggesting that they are inherently sexist.

==Characters==
* Ramatoulaye: The widowed Senegalese woman who, after 30 years of marriage and 12 children, narrates the story of her psychological abandonment by her husband, who marries a second wife. Ramatoulaye physically distances herself from Modou who dies four years after this second marriage. Ramatoulaye turns down two other marriage proposals, including that of Daouda Dieng. She is well educated and teaches at a university. After her husband&#x27;s second marriage, she must work a lot, since her husband cuts off family ties and financial support.
* Modou: The husband of Ramatoulaye and of Binetou. He was well educated, handsome, and charming. For his own selfish desires, he marries Binetou and cuts ties with his 12 children and first wife, Ramatoulaye. He later dies of a heart attack.
* Mawdo: Ex-husband of Aïssatou. After being pressured by his mother Nabou, Mawdo follows tradition of polygamy and marries a young girl also named Nabou, who is his first cousin. After his marriage with Nabou, Aïssatou (his first wife) divorces him. He is Modou&#x27;s long-time friend and a doctor.
* Aïssatou: Ramatoulaye&#x27;s best friend, to whom the letters are addressed. She divorced Mawdo because she did not believe in polygamy; she left him a letter explaining her actions and never returned. She takes care of herself well and bought Ramatoulaye a car, which made life much easier for Ramatoulaye. Her divorce is symbolic because it represents a new life for her. She later leaves Senegal with her four sons and moves to the United States to start over. She succeeds in making a new life for herself.
* Aïssatou: Ramatoulaye and Modou&#x27;s daughter, who is named after her best friend. She enters into a relationship with a boy named Ibrahim Sall, whom she calls &quot;Iba,&quot; a poor student who impregnates her. They claim to love each other and plan their marriage after their studies. Since she is still a high school student, Iba&#x27;s mother will take care of the child until she graduates.
* Ibrahima Sall: A student of law who impregnates Aissatou, Ramatoulaye&#x27;s daughter. He is tall, respectful, well-dressed, and punctual. Aïssatou is his first and possibly only love, he says. He will marry Aïssatou if Ramatoulaye will allow it.
* Binetou: A young girl around Daba&#x27;s age who marries her &quot;sugar daddy&quot; (Modou) because her mother, who was poor, wanted to live the high life and climb the social ladder. Binetou became an outcast who never quite fit in with the younger couples or the mature adults.
* Daouda Dieng: A suitor of Ramatoulaye prior to her marriage with Modou who proposes to Ramatoulaye after her husband dies, but is turned down.
* Daba: Ramatoulaye&#x27;s and Modou&#x27;s daughter. She is married and the eldest child. She is disgusted by her father&#x27;s choice to take a second wife, especially one of her closest friends.
* Arame, Yacine, and Dieynaba: Known as &quot;the trio.&quot; They are Ramatoulaye&#x27;s daughters. They smoke, drink, party, and wear pants instead of ladylike dresses. They represent the next modernized generation after liberation from France.
* Alioune and Malick: Ramatoulaye&#x27;s young boys who play ball in the streets because they claim to have no space to play in a compound. They get hit by a motorcyclist that they drag home with the intention of having their mother avenge them. They are disappointed to find that Ramatoulaye does not get mad at the cyclist, but at the boys because they were careless to play in the streets. This shows Ramatoulaye&#x27;s wisdom in raising her children in the right way.
* Ousmane and Oumar: Young sons of Ramatoulaye. They represent the idea that a father figure would be beneficial for Ramatoulaye&#x27;s children since several of them are still so young.
* Farmata: The griot woman who is Ramatoulaye&#x27;s neighbour and childhood friend. She noses into Ramatoulaye&#x27;s business and is the one to point out Aissatou&#x27;s pregnancy to Ramatoulaye. She represents a &quot;Spirit of Wisdom&quot;, but doesn&#x27;t always give the best advice. Ramatoulaye and her become friends despite caste barriers.
* Jacqueline Diack: Protestant wife of Samba Diack, a fellow doctor like Mawdo Bâ. Her husband&#x27;s openly treacherous tendencies lead her to depression.
* Little Nabou: Raised by Mawdo&#x27;s mother, Grande Nabou. She is brought up under very traditional Muslim customs and becomes a midwife. She later marries Mawdo Bâ to be his second wife. She is the niece of Grande Nabou and the first cousin of Mawdo Bâ.
* Grande Nabou: Mawdo Bâ&#x27;s mother, who influences him to marry Little Nabou. She dislikes Aïssatou since she comes from a working-class family and her father is a jewelry maker. Grande Nabou is a princess from a royal family in Senegal and is very conservative in her views and traditions.
* Mawdo Fall: He is the first son of Ranatoulaye and Modu. Gifted with intelligence, he is extremely brilliant. He always takes first position in class, after every test and exams, until his philosophy teacher at the Blaise Diagne Secondary School decides to racially discriminate against him intellectually because of a white boy, by the name of Jean Claude, by knocking off one or two marks from his grade for every single mistake he makes

<text>The Vauxhall SRV (Styling Research Vehicle) is a 1970 concept car designed by Wayne Cherry and Chris Field for Vauxhall Motors. Never intended for production, the car was an attempt to raise Vauxhall&#x27;s profile and image while providing a research platform for novel design concepts.

The car&#x27;s exterior design was inspired by the short-nosed, long-tailed Le Mans racers of the time, but was able to seat four adults in comfort, despite being just high. Unusually, the design featured fixed front seats but with all of the driver controls adjustable for position, angle, and reach. The car has been displayed more recently, such as at the &quot;London Classic Car Show&quot; in March 2017. 

The car featured four doors, with the rear doors being handle-less and largely disguised, a feature that would take more than thirty years to be incorporated into real production cars. The car could change its aerodynamic profile using an adjustable aerofoil, which was located in the nose section. The SRV also had electrically adjusted suspension levelling at the rear, and the car could redistribute fuel to different tanks to adjust the centre of gravity. 

The instruments were fixed to a pod which was hinged to the driver&#x27;s door. The engine is a 2.3-litre, transversely mid-mounted Slant-Four, featuring fuel injection with a top speed of . The engine fitted to the SRV was actually a mock up; the car was unable to run under its own power and the necessary transverse transmission was never developed.

<text>Logopolis is the seventh and final serial of the 18th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 28 February to 21 March 1981. 

The serial is set on the planets Earth and Logopolis. In the serial, the Doctor, a time traveller from the planet Gallifrey, forms a temporary truce with his arch-enemy the Master (Anthony Ainley) to stop the unravelling of the universe which the Master had started by accident.

&quot;Logopolis&quot; is Tom Baker&#x27;s last story as the Fourth Doctor, and marks the first appearances of Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor and Janet Fielding as new companion Tegan Jovanka.

==Plot==
Alerted to impending trouble by the TARDIS&#x27;s Cloister Bell, the Fourth Doctor decides to stay out of trouble, and instead repair the TARDIS&#x27;s broken chameleon circuit by materialising around a real police box on Earth and recording its exact dimensions with Adric&#x27;s help. With those, he can give the mathematicians of the planet Logopolis the right block-transfer computations to repair the circuit. The Master learns of the Doctor&#x27;s plan, and materialises his TARDIS around the police box first, causing a recursion loop with the Doctor&#x27;s. The Doctor eventually breaks his TARDIS out of the loop, but when they step outside, he sees a figure in white, the Watcher, telling him to go to Logopolis immediately. En route, they find they have gained a passenger, Tegan Jovanka, an airline stewardess who entered the police box seeking help for a broken-down car.

At Logopolis, everything seems normal as the Doctor provides the Monitor, the lead mathematician, his measurements to give to the others and perform their verbal calculations. They soon discover that the Master had arrived first, with several of the mathematicians killed by his tissue-compression eliminator. The Master&#x27;s TARDIS materialises, and he and Nyssa, under his hypnotic control, seize the control center and use a device to silence the other mathematicians, demanding the Monitor to explain the purpose of a radio telescope on the planet. The Monitor begs for the Master to stop the silencing device. The Master does so, but to the Monitor&#x27;s horror, the mathematicians remain silent, and they find the planet starting to turn to dust. The Monitor quickly explains that their calculations were used to power Charged Vacuum Emboitments (CVEs) which were used to funnel off excess entropy from this universe to prevent its approaching heat death; without the CVEs, entropy is taking over. The Monitor urges the Doctor to use their program to create a fully stable CVE, before he disintegrates. The Doctor and Master agree to work together and, after releasing Nyssa, bring Tegan with them to the Master&#x27;s TARDIS and depart for Earth. Adric and Nyssa try to follow in the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS, but initially end up far outside the universe, and watch as entropy obliterates the sector of space with Nyssa&#x27;s home planet, Traken. However, they fix the controls to track and follow the Master&#x27;s TARDIS to Earth.
On Earth, the Doctor and Master use the radio telescope of the Pharos Project – from which the Logopolitans modelled theirs – to send the program, while the Doctor&#x27;s companions help to waylay the project&#x27;s guards. However, the Master holds the Doctor hostage with his tissue compression eliminator and broadcasts a message across space, threatening to destroy the CVE and render the heat death process completely unstoppable, effectively blackmailing the rest of the universe to submit to him. The Doctor quickly runs out onto the telescope&#x27;s gantry to disconnect the power cable, which will prevent the Master from destroying the CVE, but the Master in turn tilts the dish downwards. Left with only the cable supporting him, the Doctor tears it out of its housing, deactivating the dish, but also dropping the Doctor several hundred feet to the ground. The Master escapes in his TARDIS.

Adric, Nyssa, and Tegan gather around the mortally-injured Doctor, who has visions of his past companions and enemies. His three companions see the Watcher appear, and the Doctor explains that &quot;It&#x27;s the end... but the moment has been prepared for.&quot; The Watcher touches and merges with the Doctor, causing him to regenerate into the Fifth Doctor.
==Production==
==Casting==

The serial introduces Janet Fielding in the role of Australian trainee flight attendant Tegan Jovanka. Nathan-Turner conceived the role in collaboration with Bidmead, with the intention of introducing a younger female character who would display a superficial self-assurance masking inner vulnerability, without returning to the stereotype of screaming female companions of earlier serials. Brisbane-born Fielding had lost some of her native Australian accent since emigrating to the UK in 1977, but revived her accent to audition successfully for the part.

Two cast members returned from the previous serial, &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;: Sarah Sutton reprised her role as Nyssa, joining the TARDIS crew as a companion; and Anthony Ainley had his first full exposure in the role of the Master, a part he would continue to play for eight years. Outwardly, Ainley&#x27;s beard and dark costume suggested close continuity with Roger Delgado&#x27;s portrayal in the early 1970s, but Ainley imbued his part with a greater focus on revenge and blackmail.

The part of the mysterious Watcher was played by Adrian Gibbs; his part was left uncredited in order to foster a belief among fans that Peter Davison had played the role wrapped in white fabric. In fact, Davison&#x27;s only appearance was during the final seconds of Part Four as the newly regenerated Doctor, for which he attracted a full actor&#x27;s fee.

===Filming===

For the outdoor scenes in Part One, in which Doctor materialises the TARDIS next to an actual police box on Earth, the production team had initially planned to film on location in a layby on the Barnet Bypass, in the outskirts of North London. By the 1980s, police boxes had been obsolete for many years, but one of the last surviving boxes in Britain was still standing here, and it was intended to film the TARDIS prop standing next to the real police box. However, shortly before filming was due to take place, the production team discovered that the Barnet police box had been vandalised and subsequently demolished. Filming was re-located to a layby on the southbound side of the A413 Amersham Road near Denham, Buckinghamshire. An older TARDIS prop which had last been used in season 17 was brought out of storage and assembled on location to stand in for the real police box. Today, the M25 bridges the road where the scene was filmed.

It had originally been intended to film the outdoor Pharos Project scenes in Part Four on location at the Jodrell Bank Lovell Telescope in Cheshire, but this was precluded by budgetary constraints. Instead the exterior scenes were filmed at the BBC&#x27;s receiving station in Crowsley Park, and miniature effect shots were created using a scale model of a radio telescope. The scenes in the structure of the telescope were shot on lighting gantry in the Top of the Pops studio at Television Centre, London.

Incidental music in the serial was composed by Paddy Kingsland, and includes leitmotifs for Logopolis and the Watcher. In Part Four, an excerpt from Symphony No. 8 by Franz Schubert is heard playing on the technician&#x27;s headphones in the Pharos Project control room.

===Titles===
The closing titles sequence was recompiled with Tom Baker&#x27;s face removed from the closing credits of Episode 4. The same opening and end title sequence and arrangement of the theme music was used for the following story, &quot;Castrovalva&quot;, and next three seasons, but was altered to include Peter Davison&#x27;s face. Episode 4 of this story was the last time, for the next 24 years, the lead character was listed in the credits as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (thus making it the only time Peter Davison was credited as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;). Beginning with the next story, &quot;Castrovalva&quot;, until the series&#x27;s cancellation in 1989, the character was credited simply as &quot;The Doctor&quot;. The 1996 television film did not have an on-screen credit for the Eighth Doctor, but listed the Seventh as the &quot;Old Doctor&quot;. The 2005 relaunch returned the credit to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and then again to &quot;The Doctor&quot; in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; (at the request of David Tennant). Also, Episode 4 was the first to credit two actors as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; or &quot;The Doctor&quot; when a regeneration scene was involved. It also happened at the end of Episode 4 of &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; (1984). In both instances, Peter Davison was billed second.

===Outside references===
According to Christopher Bidmead, the Logopolitans employ a hexadecimal, or base-16, numerical system, a real system commonly used in computer programming. When Adric and the Monitor read strings of numbers and letters, the letters are actually the numbers between 10 and 15, expressed as single digits.

==Broadcast and reception==

&quot;Logopolis&quot; was repeated on BBC2 in November/December 1981, as part of &quot;The Five Faces of Doctor Who&quot;. Stripped across four consecutive evenings from Monday to Thursday 9–12 November 1981, with viewing figures of 4.4, 4.6, 4.6 and 4.5 million respectively.

The serial was the last &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story aired on Saturday evening for four years. When Peter Davison took over as the Fifth Doctor in January of 1982, the BBC moved &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from Saturday nights to a new weekday prime time slot, airing two episodes per week; it did not return to Saturday evenings until 1985.

===Critical response===
Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), deeming it &quot;a magnificent farewell.&quot; Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded the serial four stars out of five. Much praise was given to Baker&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;He&#x27;s brooding, sparky and never for a second looks ready to give up.&quot; In &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy: The Discerning Fan&#x27;s Guide to Doctor Who&quot;, Marc Schuster and Tom Powers deemed the episode &quot;melancholy yet fascinating.&quot; In &quot;Doctor Who: The Episode Guide,&quot; Marc Campbell awarded the serial a 10 out of 10, praising it for &quot;its weighty subject matter and the enormous scale of its threat.&quot; Conversely, Andrew Blair of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; felt the serial lacked pathos and regarded it as &quot;a missed opportunity.&quot; Charlie Jane Anders called it &quot;A moody, dark saga about computational engineering, that never quite gels as a story and has a nonsensical ending.&quot;

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Christopher H. Bidmead, was published by Target Books in October 1982. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by Bidmead was released by BBC Audiobooks in February 2010, with a completely new cover.

In January 2007, the serial was released on DVD as part of a trilogy, entitled &quot;New Beginnings&quot;, alongside &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot; and &quot;Castrovalva&quot;. &quot;Logopolis&quot; was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files (issue 46) in October 2010. On 18 March 2019, Season 18 was re-released on Blu-ray, and given a new CGI option, including newly filmed shots filmed on location at Lovell Telescope.

<text>Sir Philip Chase Bobbitt (born July 22, 1948) is an American legal scholar and political theorist. He is best known for work on U.S. constitutional law and theory, and on the relationship between law, strategy and history in creating and sustaining the State. He is currently the Herbert Wechsler Professor of Jurisprudence at Columbia Law School and a distinguished senior lecturer at The University of Texas School of Law.

Henry Kissinger called him &quot;the outstanding political philosopher of our time&quot;. He is the author of several books, including &quot;Constitutional Fate: Theory of the Constitution&quot; (1982), &quot;The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace and the Course of History&quot; (2002), and &quot;Terror and Consent: the Wars for the Twenty-first Century&quot; (2008).

==Early life and education==
Philip Bobbitt was born in Temple, Texas, on July 22, 1948. He is the only child of Oscar Price Bobbitt Jr (1918–1995) and Rebekah Luruth Johnson Bobbitt. Oscar Price Bobbitt Jr was the son of Oscar Price Bobbitt Sr (1892–1965) and Maude Wisner, a direct descendant of Henry Wisner of Swiss descent, the only delegate from New York to vote for the Declaration of Independence. Rebekah Bobbitt was the daughter of Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. and Rebekah Baines. Her father and grandfather were members of the Texas Legislature; her great grandfather was president of Baylor University. Her brother was Lyndon B. Johnson, 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969. Between high school and college, Bobbitt spent a summer with Johnson at the White House.

At the age of 15, Bobbitt graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School, where he was elected president of the student council, in 1964. He then attended Princeton University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1971. His student thesis, &quot;On Wittgenstein and a Philosophical Topology,&quot; was one of the earliest attempts to argue for an underlying continuity between the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; and the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;. It was advised by philosopher Richard Rorty. While at Princeton, Bobbitt was president of the Ivy Club and Chairman of the Nassau Literary Magazine.

Bobbitt left Princeton after three semesters to enter AmeriCorps VISTA. He worked in a poverty program in an all-black area of Los Angeles for two years before returning to college. In 1975 he received his J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was Article Editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; and taught at Yale College. It was at Yale that he met Charles L. Black, Jr. (1915–2001), who became a friend and mentor to Bobbitt. After graduating from Yale Law School, Bobbitt clerked for Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He received his Ph.D. in modern history from the University of Oxford in 1983 as a member of Nuffield College.

==Career==
Bobbitt&#x27;s first book, &quot;Tragic Choices&quot; (1978), was written with Yale Law Professor (later Dean and Judge of the Second Circuit) Guido Calabresi. The book was a study of how societies make difficult decisions concerning resources and rights—e.g., who gets expensive medical care, who is to be drafted into the army, who may have children, and other society-defining choices. &quot;Tragic Choices&quot; has won a number of awards and is studied by multiple disciplines, including law. It has been especially influential in the field of bioethics and was discussed in several countries during the COVID-19 virus pandemic. Writing in &quot;The Times&quot; of London about the pandemic, Philip Collins said, &quot;The tragic choice is the pivot of the action in classical tragedy, and a perennial dilemma in the history of philosophy. The best book on how tragedy turns up in politics is Guido Calabresi and Philip Bobbitt&#x27;s &quot;Tragic Choices&quot;...In each case a moral imperative clashes with the scarcity of resources.&quot; 

His second book, &quot;Constitutional Fate: Theory of the Constitution&quot;, first proposed the model of the six fundamental forms of constitutional argument. One critic subsequently called it, &quot;the outstanding recent work treating constitutional law in terms of the legitimating effects of constitutional argument. It ranks among the most original and impressive works of American jurisprudence to appear during the decade.&quot; In 1994, Akhil Amar described &quot;Constitutional Fate&quot; as &quot;one of a handful of truly towering works of constitutional theory in the last half-century.&quot; Henry Monaghan, Harlan Fiske Stone Professor of Constitutional Law, Columbia School has said of
&quot;Constitutional Fate&quot;, &quot;I did not realize it at the time &quot;Constitutional Fate&quot; was published, but I do now. This is the most important and influential book on judicial review written in my lifetime.&quot;

Bobbitt was also at Nuffield College, Oxford, where he was Anderson Senior Research Fellow and a member of the Modern History faculty from 1983 to 1990; later he was the Marsh Christian Senior Research Fellow in the Department of War Studies at King&#x27;s College London 1994–1997. From 1981 to 1982, and again in 2004 he was visiting research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Until 2007, Bobbitt held the A.W. Walker Centennial Chair at the University of Texas, where he taught constitutional law. In 2005 he was the James Barr Ames Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School; in 2007, Bobbitt was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, where he accepted a permanent chair later that year; he is now the Herbert Wechsler Professor of Jurisprudence at Columbia and director of the Center for National Security there. He remains distinguished senior lecturer at the University of Texas Law School and senior fellow in the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas.

Bobbitt has delivered the Mellon Lectures at Oxford University, the Murphy Lecture on Constitutional Law at Princeton, the All Souls College Lectures at Oxford University, among several honorary lectures. In 2016 he was awarded the Jean Mayer Global Citizen Award by Tufts University.

He has been elected a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Pacific Council on International Affairs, the American Society of International Law, a Life Member of the American Law Institute, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. In 1994, he was a Fellow at the Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington. He serves as a member of the Commission on the Continuity of Government and served on the Task Force on Law and National Security of the Hoover Institution at Stanford. For some years he has been a juror for the Civil Courage Prize. In May 2010, he was appointed to serve as a member of the Secretary of State&#x27;s Advisory Committee on International Law. In 2011, he was elected to membership in the Common Room at All Souls College, Oxford. In 2012, Bobbitt was appointed to the External Advisory Board for the Central Intelligence Agency, on which he served until January 2017.

===Views on constitutional law===
Like many contemporary scholars, Bobbitt believes that the Constitution&#x27;s durability rests, in part, in the flexible manner in which it can be and has been interpreted since its creation. He emphasizes the &quot;modalities of constitutional argument&quot;: 1) structural; 2) textual; 3) ethical; 4) prudential; 5) historical; and 6) doctrinal. He has argued in his books for the recognition of the ethical modality, which has to do with the traditional vision we have of the nation and the role government ought to play (some scholars call this form &quot;argument from tradition&quot;). He first introduced these forms of argument—or modalities—as a way of understanding constitutional review generally in &quot;Constitutional Fate: Theory of the Constitution&quot; (1982), a study of judicial review and then broadened their application to constitutional review generally in &quot;Constitutional Interpretation&quot; (1993) which deals with non-judicial examples of constitutional argument and decision making. Bobbitt asserts that all branches of government have a duty to assess the constitutionality of their actions. Bobbitt&#x27;s &quot;modalities&quot; of constitutional law are now generally considered to be the standard model for constitutional arguments.

===Government service===
Bobbitt has served extensively in government, for both Democratic and Republican administrations. In the 1970s, he was Associate Counsel to President Carter for which he received the Certificate of Meritorious Service, and worked with Lloyd Cutler on the charter of the Central Intelligence Agency. He later was Legal Counsel to the Iran-Contra Committee in the U. S. Senate, the Counselor for International Law and member of the Senior Executive Service at the State Department during the George H. W. Bush administration, and served at the National Security Council, where he was director for Intelligence Programs, senior director for Critical Infrastructure, and senior director for Strategic Planning during Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency. He was a principal draftsman of PDD63, the first presidential document to establish a strategy for critical infrastructure and cyber protection. Subsequently he was strategist in residence to the Secretary of the Navy, Richard Danzig, and has lectured at West Point, Annapolis, and the National Defense University where for some years he delivered the annual opening keynote lecture.

==Other works==
In the early &#x27;80s, Bobbitt published &quot;Democracy and Deterrence: The History and Future of Nuclear Strategy&quot;. This book argued that US nuclear targeting had gone through reciprocal cycles, alternating between total and graduated response regimes. These cycles were driven, he argued, not by changes in the central deterrence relationship between the American homeland and the homelands of its adversaries but by developments in extended deterrence—the protection of non-homeland theatres by US nuclear forces. An accompanying volume, &quot;US Nuclear Strategy: A Reader&quot; was edited by Bobbitt, Gregory F. Treverton and Sir Lawrence Freedman.

Bobbitt&#x27;s most recent two books are second editions of classics in US law, &quot;The Ages of American Law&quot; by Grant Gilmore, first published by the 1970s which Bobbitt brought up to present time; and &quot;Impeachment: A Handbook&quot; by Charles Black. &quot;Impeachment&quot; was doubled in size, and was widely discussed during the various Trump proceedings. Both books were published by the Yale Press.

Bobbitt is currently at work on &quot;The Constitution Trilogy&quot; for Oxford University Press.

==Other activities==
Since 1990, Bobbitt has endowed the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry, awarded biennially by the Library of Congress. It is the only prize given by the nation for poetry. 

He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a former trustee of Princeton University. In 2004 &quot;Prospect Magazine&quot; named him One of Britain&#x27;s Top 100 Public Intellectuals. He occasionally writes essays, typically on foreign policy, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He has served on the boards of the Institute for Religious Studies; the Barbara Jordan Freedom Foundation, the Rothko Interfaith Chapel, the Executive Council of the American Society of International Law, and the Editorial Board of &quot;Biosecurity and Bioterrorism&quot;. He is a member of the Executive Committee of The Pilgrims.

In 2021 Bobbitt was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). The appointment was made substantive on 11 June 2024.

In 2021, he became the chair of the American Friends of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly; in 2023 he was selected as president.

In late 2024, he was elected President of the Pilgrims Society of the United States. 
==Personal life==
Bobbitt has been married twice. His second marriage was in 2011, to Maya Ondalikoglu, a former student. They were married by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Elena Kagan in her chambers. Lady Bobbitt took her BA, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, at the University of Pennsylvania where she gave the Commencement Address at her graduation.

=== &quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot; ===
In 2002, Knopf published &quot;The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace and the Course of History&quot; (Knopf), an ambitious 900-page work that explicates a theory, actually a philosophy, of historical change in the modern era, and a history of the development of modern constitutional and international law. Bobbitt traces interacting patterns in the (mainly modern European) history of strategic innovations, major wars, peace conferences, international diplomacy, and constitutional standards for states. Bobbitt also suggests possible future scenarios and policies appropriate to them.

Arguing that &quot;law and strategy are not merely made in history.  . . they are made of history&quot; (p. 5), Bobbitt presents a dynamic view of historical change that has a dark, tragic dimension, for he holds that the painful and, indeed, process of resolving issues that create conflict and war tends to cause changes that render obsolete the solution to that conflict (generally a new form of the state possessing a new principle of legitimacy), even as it is established. This tragic dimension is evoked in the title of Bobbitt&#x27;s book, inspired by the last lines of Book 18 of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, describing a shield fabricated for Achilles by Hephaestus, across the &quot;vast expanse&quot; of which &quot;with all his craft and cunning/the god creates a world of gorgeous immortal work&quot; (trans. Robert Fagles).

&quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot; generated much interest in the diplomatic and political community. Public officials who followed Bobbitt&#x27;s works included Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who built his Dimbleby Lecture around Bobbitt&#x27;s thesis and the former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger

&quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot; was the 2003 Grand Prize Winner of the Hamilton Awards and the Arthur Ross Book Award Bronze Medalist of the Council on Foreign Relations for Best Book in Foreign Policy of that year. British military historian Michael Howard wrote, &quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot; &quot;will be one of the most important works on international relations published during the last fifty years&quot;, and Paul Kennedy, writing in The New York Review of Books argued that it may &quot;become a classic for future generations.&quot; In contrast, a strongly critical review by Paul W. Schroeder in &quot;The National Interest&quot;, while acknowledging acknowledging that his view was &quot;evidently a minority one&quot;, described the book as &quot;error strewn&quot; and &quot;unscholarly&quot;.

=== &quot;Terror and Consent&quot; ===

In 2008, Knopf published Bobbitt&#x27;s &quot;Terror and Consent: the Wars for the Twenty-first Century&quot;, which applied many of the ideas of &quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot; to the problems of wars on terror. In &quot;Terror &amp; Consent&quot;, Bobbitt argued that the only justification for warfare in the 21st century was to protect human rights.

&quot;Terror and Consent&quot; was on both the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;’s best-seller lists and was widely reviewed. The front page of the &quot;New York Times Sunday Book Review&quot; called it, &quot;quite simply the most profound book to have been written on the subject of American foreign policy since the attacks of 9/11 — indeed, since the end of the cold war.&quot; Among others, Senator John McCain praised the book as &quot;the best book I&#x27;ve ever read on terrorism,&quot; and Henry Kissinger called Bobbitt, &quot;perhaps the most important political philosopher today.&quot;Tony Blair wrote of &quot;Terror and Consent&quot;, &quot;It may be written by an academic but it is actually required reading for political leaders.&quot; David Cameron, the leader of the UK Conservative Party put it on a list of summer reading for his parliamentary colleagues in 2008.

In 2017, he had a spirited exchange arguing that litigation is not the exclusive legal method for determining constitutionality in national security affairs and that law applied even when the constitutional issue in question was not justiciable.
General Sir Rupert Smith wrote that &quot;Terror and Consent&quot;, &quot;shows more convincingly than any other book I know, why the defeat of terrorism must be brought about within the context of law.&quot; Bobbitt is currently at work on a third book in this series, &quot;The Bow of Odysseus: Statecraft and the Future of World Order.&quot;

=== &quot;The Garments of Court and Palace&quot; ===
In 2013, Bobbitt published a study of Niccolò Machiavelli entitled &quot;The Garments of Court and Palace: Machiavelli and the World That He Made&quot;. In this book he argues that only by understanding &quot;The Prince&quot; as one half of a constitutional treatise on the State (the other being Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;) can we reconcile the many otherwise contradictory elements of his work. Bobbitt also situates this constitutional treatise in the politics of Machiavelli&#x27;s day.

<text>Leigh Izaak Francis (born 30 April 1973), who is often known by the name of a character he plays, Keith Lemon, is an English television presenter, comedian, actor, and writer. He is best known for creating and starring in Channel 4&#x27;s sketch comedy show &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; (2002–2009) and presenting the ITV shows &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot; (2008–2022) and &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; (2013–2019). His other comedy shows include &quot;Lemon La Vida Loca&quot; (2012–2013), &quot;The Keith Lemon Sketch Show&quot; (2015–2016), and &quot;The Keith &amp; Paddy Picture Show&quot; (2017–2018).

==Early life==
Francis was born in Beeston, Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 30 April 1973, and was brought up on a council estate in Old Farnley, Leeds. His father died aged 47 of cancer, whilst his mother, Pat, is still alive.

Francis attended Farnley Park High School (now The Farnley Academy). He later studied at Jacob Kramer College and received a qualification in graphic design. Before making his major television breakthrough, he was discovered and encouraged by television presenter Davina McCall, performing in-role stand-up comedy in a southern comedy club.

McCall landed Francis his first television role on &quot;Dom and Kirk&#x27;s Nite O&#x27; Plenty&quot;, where he portrayed Bobby Stark, a man who gives tips on how to win over the ladies. The series aired on Paramount Television from January to July 1996. Francis&#x27; second television role was as Barry Gibson, a music paparazzo, featured on the early series of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Popworld&quot;. Francis also starred as various characters, including Gibson, Keith Lemon and Avid Merrion in the series &quot;Whatever I Want&quot;, which aired late night on ITV in 2000.

==Career==
In his early career, Francis did a series of shorts for Comedy Central (then known as Paramount Comedy) called &quot;Stars in Their Houses&quot;. Some of the shorts can be found on YouTube.

His major television breakthrough occurred when Channel 4 offered him a £250,000 deal to produce a series based on his television characters, such as his previous roles as Bobby Stark and Barry Gibson, and in 2002, &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; was born. The series featured Francis portraying a series of celebrities by wearing face masks to impersonate them, as well as portraying the main, non-celebrity character, Avid Merrion. The programme lasted for five series, airing between 2002 and 2006, however, the last two series were only loosely based on the original three. Series 4 was subtitled &quot;A Bear&#x27;s Tail&quot;, and was based on another of his characters, &quot;The Bear&quot;. Series 5 returned to Avid Merrion and was called &quot;Bo! in the USA&quot;.

Following the axing of &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot;, Francis took one of the series characters, Keith Lemon, and created a brand new show, &quot;Keith Lemon&#x27;s Very Brilliant World Tour&quot;, which aired on ITV2 in April 2008. The show was a success, and subsequently, Francis created another new show featuring Lemon, &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot;, which aired for 26 series between 2008 and 2022. Lemon also co-hosted &quot;Sing If You Can&quot; (2011) with Stacey Solomon and &quot;Keith Lemon&#x27;s LemonAid&quot; (2012) on ITV.
In 2012, he was the protagonist in his feature film debut in the self-titled &quot;Keith Lemon: The Film&quot;, alongside Kelly Brook.
Francis has since presented and/or appeared in numerous other ITV2 programmes in character as Lemon, including &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; (2013–2019), &quot;The Keith Lemon Sketch Show&quot; (2015–2016), &quot;The Keith &amp; Paddy Picture Show&quot; (2017–2018), alongside Paddy McGuinness and &quot;Shopping with Keith Lemon&quot; (2019–2023). Francis had a cameo in &quot;Rocketman&quot;, the 2019 Elton John biopic, playing a shop worker named Pete.

Talking about a scrapped pilot for a Bo Selecta reboot, Francis retired the character of Keith Lemon, saying &quot;Keith Lemon is, well, I&#x27;ll never kill any characters off... I don&#x27;t ever kill any characters off. Apart from if it&#x27;s one that someone is really upset by. Then you don&#x27;t do it anymore, because you only d**k about to put smiles on people&#x27;s faces.&quot;. Francis continues to producing content for his YouTube, where he posts sketches in the vein of Selecta and other characters. In early 2024, Francis went on tour, starring in &quot;My First Time&quot;.

He competed on &quot;The Great Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off&quot; (a charity special of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;) in 2024 where he won the second episode of the 7th series. As of October 2024, he is starring in the West End Production of Back to the Future the Musical as Strickland at the London Adelphi Theatre.

==Personal life==
On 30 October 2002, at Allerton Castle, North Yorkshire, Francis married Jill Carter, a beauty therapist. They have two daughters.

On 4 June 2020, Francis apologised on Instagram, as himself, for his portrayal of various black celebrities on &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot;. In the video description he added &quot;Following recent events, I&#x27;ve done a lot of talking and learning and I would like to put this out there. I want to apologise to anyone that was offended by &quot;Bo&#x27;selecta&quot;. I&#x27;m on a constant journey of knowledge and just wanted to say I&#x27;m deeply sorry. #blacklivesmatter&quot;.

==Characterisation==
In interviews, Francis usually adopts one of his celebrity guises, being interviewed as Avid Merrion during &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot;&#x27;s run between 2002 and 2006, and as Keith Lemon ever since. In an out-of-character interview with &quot;On: Yorkshire Magazine&quot;, Francis confirmed Avid Merrion&#x27;s accent and dialects were inspired by his former tutor at Jacob Kramer College, Laimonis Mieriņš. He also pointed out Merrion is a misspelling of Mieriņš, and has nothing to do with the Merrion Centre in Leeds as some may have assumed. Francis has also been interviewed as himself for &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot;, &quot;Loose Women&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Little Brother&quot;, &quot;The Museum of Curiosity&quot;, &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Brunch&quot;.

<text>Sandra Rinaldo, née Brycks (born 16 January 1950) is a Canadian television journalist and anchor for CTV News. She is the daughter of survivors of the Holocaust and is of the Jewish faith.

==Youth and education==
She was born in Toronto, and was first seen on television as a dancer during the mid-1960s on CBC Television youth series such as &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;. Rinaldo graduated from York University&#x27;s Fine Arts program with an Honours Bachelor of Arts in 1973.

==Broadcasting career==
A week after graduation, Rinaldo joined CTV Television Network&#x27;s news division, initially working as a junior secretary to Donald Cameron, director of news. She later advanced to production manager then research for &quot;W5&quot;, as well as reporting for &quot;CTV National News&quot; and &quot;Canada AM&quot;. She became anchor for the newscasts on &quot;Canada AM&quot; in 1980, making her the first woman in Canada to hold a full-time position as a national news anchor. During her broadcasting career she interviewed several top celebrities including John Candy, Gordon Lightfoot and Bob Marley. In 1985 she became weekend anchor of &quot;CTV National News&quot;, a post she has held ever since, except for a brief period from 1990 to 1991 during which she was co-anchor with Tom Gibney of the local &quot;World Beat News&quot; on the network&#x27;s Toronto affiliate CFTO.

Since longtime weekday anchor Lloyd Robertson&#x27;s retirement in 2011, Rinaldo served as substitute anchor for Robertson&#x27;s successor, Lisa LaFlamme, on the main weekday national newscast. Since 2009, she has been anchoring CTV News Channel three weekday afternoons. As of 2010, she is also a co-host of &quot;W5&quot; and a contributing reporter.

In 2023, she marked her 50th anniversary of working for CTV, with the network broadcasting a one-hour retrospective special about her career on May 12. In the same year, CTV launched a new early edition of &quot;CTV National News&quot;, to air at 5:30 p.m. with Rinaldo as anchor.

==Personal life==
She was married to Michael Rinaldo ( 1945–2005) until his death, and has three daughters.

==Awards==
A list of awards won by Rinaldo:

* Bryden Alumni Award, York University (2005)

<doc id="1303873" wikidata="Q7271719" url="?curid=1303873" title="Quick kick">
<text>In gridiron football, a quick kick is any punt made under conditions in which the opposing team would not expect a punt. Typically this has been a kick from scrimmage from a formation that is, or resembles, one usually used other than for punting, or at least not resembling the one usually used for punting. Typically it will also be on some down before last down (last down being third in Canadian, and, since 1912, fourth in American football), unless done from a formation usually used for place kicking.

==Purpose==
The purpose of a quick kick is the same as that for all punting, but with the additional plan of:

* preventing a runback (return) of the ball by the opponent
* additional distance by the ball&#x27;s bouncing or rolling instead of being fielded by an opponent
* (when legal) recovery and retained possession of the ball by the kicking team
* scoring (and preventing the scoring of) a single point in Canadian football

==Disadvantages==
The disadvantages (required for the punt to be unexpected) are one or more of these:

* earlier sacrifice of possession of the ball, or sacrifice of a kick at goal (field goal)
* greater exposure to the kick being blocked by an opponent, or inadvertently by a teammate
* sacrificing distance or accuracy by need of being done quickly
* being done by someone other than the team&#x27;s best punter

==Occurrence==
Factors that make a quick kick more likely:

* the play being in a team&#x27;s repertoire 
* long distance to go for a new first down
* the other team not showing anticipation of a quick kick, as by dropping a safety player far back
* being close to one&#x27;s own goal line
* being close enough to the other team&#x27;s goal line that a field goal attempt is credible, but far enough that its success is not likely
* current or historic rules allowing for the kicking team to recover and retain possession of the ball; see onside kick
* the team having a player good at both punting and other backfield roles
* the team not having a good specialist at punting
* conditions that make long drives (moving the ball in continuous team possession) unlikely
* a strong wind blowing either with or against the team; a headwind would encourage a low kick which, if expected, would get quickly to the other team for a runback; a tailwind could allow an unfielded kick much extra distance
* hard playing surface, allowing extra distance via bounce
* the punter-to-be&#x27;s lining up a yard or so deeper in formation than that backs usual position, (sometimes concealed by other backs lining up deeper too) or going in motion by backpedaling
* fashion in the circuit in which the game is played

If a team uses the quick kick a lot, surprise can be maintained only by their also having a fake quick kick play. One type of such play is the equivalent of the Statue of Liberty play for the forward pass: the ostensible punter holds the ball out as if to drop it, then hands it to a teammate stepping behind or in front of him.

A quick kick is usually done from closer to the line of scrimmage than an ordinary punt. For approximately the decade of the 1910s in American football, the rules discouraged the quick kick by requiring that the ball be kicked from at least five yards behind the line of scrimmage. Because of the closeness of the opposing team, the approach the kicker uses before dropping the ball for a quick kick is often designed to decrease the distance forward that the punter will step, or to reduce the time of the approach. One such technique is the &quot;rocker step&quot;, in which the punter first steps backward and then rocks forward. Another is to take a somewhat sideways approach, leaning and kicking somewhat &quot;across the body&quot;; for a right-footed kicker this means approaching toward the right while leaning left.

A quick kick made relatively close to the opposing goal line is often executed by a technique called a &quot;pooch punt&quot;, which is a more controlled kick. A typical last down punt or a punt taken as a free kick is done with the emphasis mostly on maximizing distance.

==Frequency==
Quick kicks are relatively rare in American football, but they have never completely disappeared. Notable quick kicks in college football include one performed by Tate Forcier of the University of Michigan against the University of Notre Dame on September 12, 2009, and a 54-yard punt by Kellen Moore of Boise State University against Louisiana Tech on October 26, 2010.

In the NFL, quarterback Randall Cunningham made 20 quick kicks during his career. Ben Roethlisberger has five quick kicks for a career net average of 24.2 yards per kick, two of which went for touchbacks. New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady performed a quick kick punt on a third and ten against the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs, on January 14, 2012.

Quick kicks were a much more frequent occurrence in the original XFL during its lone season in 2001. This was because the XFL permitted kicking teams to recover and advance their own punts provided they travelled a minimum of 25 yards. XFL teams usually attempted quick kicks in third and long situations.

<doc id="1303884" wikidata="Q7198575" url="?curid=1303884" title="Pit orchestra">
<text>A pit orchestra is a type of orchestra that accompanies performers in musicals, operas, ballets, and other shows involving music. The term was also used for orchestras accompanying silent movies when more than a piano was used. In performances of operas and ballets, the pit orchestra is typically similar in size to a symphony orchestra, though it may contain smaller string and brass sections, depending upon the piece. Such orchestras may vary in size from approximately 30 musicians (early Baroque and Classical opera) to as many as 90–100 musicians (Wagnerian opera). However, because of financial, spatial, and volume concerns, current musical theatre pit orchestras are considerably smaller (20–30 musicians at most, including a maximum of around ten string players).

==Description==
Typically, pit orchestras play in a lowered area in front of the stage called an orchestra pit, rather than being on the stage as for a concert. Inside the pit, the conductor stands facing towards the stage with their back towards the audience to coordinate the music with the vocals and actions of the singers, dancers and actors, while the orchestra sits facing the conductor. The conductor may also sit at one or more keyboards and conduct as well as play, which often means the use of more head and facial gestures rather than hand gestures. This is often the case when a show only requires a small orchestra, or on national tours, where the instrumentation is often reduced from the original arrangement and one or two keyboard players substitute for several instruments. In some cases, theatres do not have a lowered pit; in this case, the pit orchestra may play in a room near the stage, watching the conductor&#x27;s gestures using a video monitor, or from the floor level, between the first row of seats and the (higher) stage.

Music parts for pit orchestra woodwind players in musical theatre are normally divided into &quot;reed books&quot;. Orchestration varies with each show based on the type of music that will be performed, such as jazz, classical, or blues. For example, a Reed 1 Book may contain music for piccolo, flute, alto saxophone, clarinet, and/or oboe. A musician handed a reed book would be expected to play each part. Because the musician plays so many different instruments, he or she is referred to as a &quot;doubler&quot; (even though the Reed Books may have up to eight instruments each). In general, individual reed books tend to fall into one of 3 categories: high reed, low reed, and double reed. High reed books may contain soprano, alto, or tenor saxophone; Bb, bass, or E-flat clarinet; and flute, alto flute or piccolo. Low reed books may contain bass or contrabass clarinet, baritone or bass saxophone, and bassoon. Double reed books may contain oboe and English horn, often in addition to flute, clarinet or saxophone. Due to the need for certain instruments to play solo or group parts throughout a musical, higher reed books often contain more doubled instruments throughout, whereas lower reed books contain fewer. For example, in West Side Story, clarinet and bass clarinet parts are present in each of the top four reed books, even though they rarely play simultaneously; rather, in certain sections of the music, a few of these parts must play simultaneously while instruments that are only present on a single part (such as alto saxophone, E-flat clarinet, oboe, English horn, and soprano saxophone) play separately. However, the Reed 5 book contains only bassoon parts, which are not present on any other books.

Musicians who play in pit orchestras are not only required to play multiple instruments at times, but they must also be familiar with (and able to play in) multiple keys, styles, and tempos and make a switch instantaneously. The orchestration for a musical is written in a key best suited to range of the singer. Some keys are more difficult to play in than others because of the increased attention that greater amounts of sharps and flats require. Musicals also tend to have a number of styles which can range from a soulful ballad to a syncopated funk tune to a driving hard rock song. Many musicians have been trained to play in a certain style, such as classical music, but in order to play in pit orchestras, musicians must be able to play a range of different styles. Because musicals are live, many elements can change from show to show; pit orchestra musicians consequently should be able to play different tempos every night and even skip through their music to a new spot if an actor or singer makes an error.

==Preparation==

As with any orchestra or similar ensemble, a pit orchestra rehearses with the singers and dancers before the public performances commence. The rehearsals are led by the conductor/music director, who sets the tempos, starts the songs and musical interludes and indicates pauses and endings of sections.

Although members of a pit orchestra are not required to demonstrate great stage presence, and they may work out of sight from much of the audience, they can generally be seen from the balcony seats and are thus required to adhere to standard rules of dress and appearance (e.g., formal clothes) 

Preparation by musicians in a pit orchestra consists of much more than attending rehearsals. Before the first rehearsal, ensemble musicians individually practice their parts, particularly difficult sections (rapid passages, very high or low-register sections) and exposed passages (e.g., instrumental solos). Performers often listen to a recording of the show to learn the tempos and playing styles, particularly if there are sections where the pit orchestra has complex parts which depend on the onstage actors or singers&#x27; parts (e.g., a big orchestra chord might have to coincide with the firing of a prop gun onstage).

==Size==
Pit orchestras can range from large orchestras to small rock combos (e.g., guitar/keyboards/bass/drums). While a pit orchestra usually plays in the orchestra pit, there are times when they are on stage in the background (this is usually for rock musicals). In some cases, one or more members of the pit orchestra may have to appear in costume on stage with their instrument and play music as part of a scene. Below are pit orchestra examples from four major theatrical license companies: Music Theatre International, Concord Theatricals, The Really Useful Group and Theatrical Rights Worldwide (excluding any conductor scores unless needed). These show the varying sizes of pit orchestras. Note that string parts are often written with the intent of having two musicians play a specific part, especially in older musicals.

In the 2000s, due to budget constraints, some musicals have replaced instruments from musical arrangements with keyboards. For example, instead of hiring a small string section, a musical may hire one or two synthesizer players to perform the string parts or the horn parts. Some musicals have used prerecorded backing track music for shows, which has led to controversy.

<text>Comet Humason, formally designated C/1961 R1 (a.k.a. 1962 VIII and 1961e), was a non-periodic comet discovered by Milton L. Humason on 1 September 1961. Its perihelion was well beyond the orbit of Mars, at 2.133 AU. The outbound orbital period is about 2,516 years.

== Physical properties ==
It was a &quot;giant&quot; comet, much more active than a normal comet for its distance to the Sun, with an absolute magnitude of 1.35−3.5, and a nucleus diameter estimated at . It could have been up to a hundred times brighter than an average new comet. It had an unusually disrupted or &quot;turbulent&quot; appearance. It was also unusual in that the spectrum of its tail showed a strong predominance of the ion CO+, a result previously seen unambiguously only in C/1908 R1 (Morehouse).

<text>The spikey bass (Hypopterus macropterus) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Latidae, the lates perches. It is endemic to coastal waters off Western Australia, where it inhabits areas with soft substrates. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Hypopterus.

==Description==
The spikey bass is an olive brown bass-like fish fading pale silvery below, each scale is marked with a dark oval spot and there are eight indistinct vertical bands along the head and body. This species has a deeper body than other species in the Latidae. It grows to a standard length of .

== Distribution and habitat ==

The spikey bass is endemic to the eastern Indian Ocean off the coast of northwestern Australia. It prefers demersal and temperate waters.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
The spikey bass’s generic name &quot;Hypopterus&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;hypo&quot; (under) and &quot;pteron&quot; (wing or fin).This species was first formally described as &quot;Psammoperca macroptera&quot; in 1859 by the German born British zoologist Albert Günther (1830-1914), with the type locality given as &quot;Victora&quot;, meaning Port Essington in the Northern Territory but is actually thought to be Shark Bay in Western Australia. Theodore Nicholas Gill described the monospecific genus &quot;Hypopterus&quot; for this Australian endemic taxon in 1861.

<text>Jean Marie Claude Alexandre Goujon (13 April 1766, Bourg-en-Bresse – 17 June 1795, Paris) was a politician of the French Revolution. He was a member of the National Convention from 1793 to 1795, was sentenced to death after the Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III and committed suicide before he could be executed.

==Early life==
His grandfather, Claude Goujon, was director of a tax farm (les droits réunis) in Dijon, and his father, Claude Alexandre Goujon, was a tax farmer from Bourg-en-Bresse. On 9 February 1762, Claude Alexandre married Joan Margaret Nicole Ricard, daughter of Joseph Ricard, a barrister, and First Secretary of the Stewardship of Burgundy (born 1745). In 1774 the family moved to Provins.

The young Jean-Marie Goujon abandoned his studies after his father encountered financial difficulties, going first to Dieppe and then Saint-Malo to join the Navy. Having enlisted at the age of twelve as a seaman aboard the &quot;Diadême&quot;, he was on board the &quot;Saint-Esprit&quot; at the Battle of Ushant (1778) against the English fleet. The next day he wrote his father a letter that was read aloud in the garden of the Palais Royal as a victory bulletin.

After two years working for a merchant in Saint-Malo, he secured a job as sub-inspector of artillery crews in Morlaix, before being employed in the offices of the navy first at Brest, then in Saint-Malo. In 1783, seventeen years old, he moved to Mauritius, where his uncle Ricard, future mayor of Port-Louis, had a trading house. He came back in France the following year. In 1786, he became an attorney&#x27;s clerk in Paris, where he befriended another young clerk, Pierre-François Tissot. In May 1790 he joined his parents in Rennes, where his father was director of the postal service, and entered the offices of the Intendant of Brittany. In 1790, he settled at Meudon, near Paris, and resumed his education.

==During the revolution==
Goujon took part in the early days of the revolution, helping to seize weapons after the dismissal of Necker and becoming a member of the council of the Légion du Châtelet. At the end of 1789, he acquired some academic recognition for his discourse offered as an entry for a prize from the Academy of Dijon, &quot;On the Influence of the Morals of Governments on those of the People&quot;, which was influenced by Rousseau and Mably. The prize was not awarded, by the Academy declared that only Goujon&#x27;s entry had been of genuine interest to them.

In 1791, he first came to the attention of the general public following his response to the letter of Raynal, in which the Encyclopedist violently attacked the work of the Constituent Assembly. Later that year, he was living at Meudon and was invited to deliver the funeral address for Mirabeau at Versailles. He also became a member of the Society of the Friends of the Constitution (known as the Jacobins) of Sèvres. In 1792 he was elected first as administrator, then, the day after the storming of the Tuilleries, as Attorney-General of the Department of Seine-et-Oise.

==Convention==
On 17 September 1792 Goujon became the sixth alternate deputy to the National Convention for Seine-et-Oise, winning 410 out of 657 votes.

Engaged in the fight against high prices in autumn 1792, in November he wrote and presented to the Convention an address demanding the taxation of grain prices. In this he showed that the government&#x27;s liberal economic policy had important social consequences: &quot;The unlimited freedom of the grain trade is incompatible with the existence of our Republic. And indeed, what constitutes a Republic? A small number of capitalists and a large number of poor... This class of capitalists and landlords, the unlimited freedom that makes mistress of grain prices, is also mistress of the establishment of the working day.&quot; He concluded by calling for land reform, with a maximum farm size of , and the central management of essential supplies, with its members elected by the people. He also argued in favour of a law establishing the general maximum, thus introducing price controls. At the time the Convention was dominated by the Gironde, so his proposal was rejected. Only when the Jacobins took power was a Commission on Subsistence and Provisions set up, in October 1793. On 5 Brumaire Year II (26 October 1793) Goujon became one of its three commissioners, and played a major role in this post in establishing the fixed prices that were to be enforced under the general maximum. Having completed this work, Goujon resigned from the Commission on 2 Ventôse (20 February 1794).

Soon after, he was assigned to a diplomatic mission to Istanbul, but never actually went on it. From 5–8 April 1794 he served as interim Foreign Minister and Interior Minister, and on 26 Germinal (15 April) after Hérault de Séchelles was guillotined, Goujon took his seat as a member of the Convention.

On 12 Floréal (1 May) he was appointed by the Committee of Public Safety to be Représentant en mission to the Var, Bouches-du-Rhône and Alpes-Maritimes, but appears not to have actually gone there either. Instead, on 17 Prairial (15 June) he was appointed Représentant en mission to the Armies of the Rhine and the Moselle. He did take up this post, accompanied by Tissot as his secretary, and together with Nicolas Hentz and Pierre Bourbotte, took part in the campaign which conquered the Palatinate.

Goujon was in Thionville when news reached him of the fall of Robespierre in the Thermidorian Reaction. He wrote to the Convention on 13 Thermidor to congratulate it on its victory, and his letter was read aloud from the tribune. He was recalled by order of the Committee of Public Safety on 23 Thermidor (10 August). Reaching Paris on 10 Fructidor (27 August), he soon found himself increasingly at odds with those now in power.

On 12 Fructidor (29 August) he defended the seven members of the former committees who had been attacked by Laurent Lecointre. On 20 Pluviôse
Year III (8 February 1795) he responded to the arrest of Gracchus Babeuf and the closure of political clubs by proposing a decree against those who attacked the rights of man and the constitution. On 18 Ventôse (8 March) he was the only deputy with sufficient courage to vote against the readmission to the Convention of Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvrai and other survivors of the Girondin party, who he felt would be too much inclined to avenge old wrongs.

On 21 Ventôse (11 March) he complained that people who had previously been described as patriots were now being subjected to the vague designation of &quot;terrorists&quot;, and claimed that this &quot;vague designation&quot; had been invented by men who wished to stir dissent by placing suspicion on every head. On 1 Germinal (21 March) he fought against the police bill proposed by Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès, and when Jean-Lambert Tallien attacked the Constitution of Year I, Goujon threatened him with the anger of the people.

==Downfall==
When the populace invaded the legislature on the 1 Prairial Year III (20 May 1795), he proposed the immediate establishment of a special commission to ensure delivery of the changes demanded by the insurgents and assume the functions of the various committees.

The failure of the Prairial insurrection led to the immediate fall of those deputies who had supported the demands of the populace. Before the close of the sitting, Goujon, with Gilbert Romme, Jean-Michel Duroy, Adrien Duquesnoy, Pierre Bourbotte, Pierre-Aimable de Soubrany, and others were placed under arrest by their colleagues. Taken out of Paris, he and his fellow prisoners had a narrow escape from a mob at Avranches on their way to the château du Taureau (fr) in Brittany. While being held in prison there, he composed revolutionary poetry.

They were brought back to Paris for trial before a military commission on 17 June, although no proof of their complicity in organizing the insurrection could be found. (In fact, with the exception of Goujon and Bourbotte, the accused did not know each other). They were sentenced to death. In accordance with a pre-arranged plan, they attempted suicide on the staircase leading from the courtroom with a knife that Goujon had concealed. Goujon succeeded, as did Romme, Bourbotte and Soubrany but the others merely wounded themselves, before being taken immediately to the guillotine.

Before his suicide, he said: &quot;I swore to defend her (i.e. the Constitution of Year I) and die for her, I die happy not to have betrayed my oath... I would die happier if I were certain that after me, she would not be destroyed and replaced by another constitution (i.e. the Constitution of Year III) where equality is disregarded, rights violated, and that the masses will be completely subservient to the rich, sole masters of the government and of the state.&quot;

==Family==
On 3 April 1793, in Mettray, Goujon married Lise (Marie) Cormery (1771-1843), daughter of an administrator of the département of Indre-et-Loire. Camille Desmoulins praised Goujon&#x27;s letter proposing marriage to Lise Cornery, with its patriotic sentiments, as an example of upright citizenship. They had one son, Philarète, an architect, born in Paris on 28 Frimaire Year III (18 December 1794), who died without issue at Tours on 28 December 1832.

<text>The 1890 Manifesto (also known as the Woodruff Manifesto, the Anti-polygamy Manifesto, or simply &quot;the Manifesto&quot;) is a statement which officially advised against any future plural marriage in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Issued by Church President Wilford Woodruff in September 1890, the Manifesto was a response to mounting anti-polygamy pressure from the United States Congress, which by 1890 had disincorporated the church, escheated its assets to the U.S. federal government, and imprisoned many prominent polygamist Mormons. Upon its issuance, the LDS Church in conference accepted Woodruff&#x27;s Manifesto as &quot;authoritative and binding.&quot;

The Manifesto was a dramatic turning point in the history of the LDS Church. It advised church members against entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it easier for Utah to become a U.S. state. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, thus necessitating a Second Manifesto during U.S. congressional hearings in 1904. Though neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early-to-mid 20th century. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church standard works as Official Declaration 1 and is considered by mainstream Mormons to have been prompted by divine revelation (although not a revelation itself), in which Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it. Some Mormon fundamentalists rejected the manifesto.

==Background==
The Manifesto was issued in response to the anti-polygamy policies of the federal government of the United States, and most especially the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1887. This law disincorporated the LDS Church and authorized the federal government to seize all of the church&#x27;s assets. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the provisions of the Edmunds–Tucker Act in &quot;Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States&quot; in May 1890.

In April 1889, Woodruff, the president of the church, began privately refusing the permission that was required to contract new plural marriages. In October 1889, Woodruff publicly admitted that he was no longer approving new polygamous marriages, and in answer to a reporter&#x27;s question of what the LDS Church&#x27;s attitude was toward the law against polygamy, Woodruff stated, &quot;We mean to obey it. We have no thought of evading it or ignoring it.&quot; Because it had been Mormon practice for over 25 years to either evade or ignore anti-polygamy laws, Woodruff&#x27;s statement was a signal that a change in church policy was developing.

In February 1890, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Davis v. Beason&quot; that a law in Idaho Territory which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional. That decision left the Mormons no further legal recourse to their current marriage practices and made it unlikely that without change Utah Territory would be granted statehood.

Woodruff later said that on the night of September 23, 1890, he received a revelation from Jesus Christ that the church should cease the practice of plural marriage. The following morning, he reported this to some of the general authorities and placed the hand-written draft on a table. George Reynolds would later recount that he, Charles W. Penrose, and John R. Winder modified Woodruff&#x27;s draft into the current language accepted by the general authorities and presented to the church as a whole. Woodruff announced the Manifesto on September 25 by publishing it in the church-owned &quot;Deseret Weekly&quot; in Salt Lake City. On October 6, 1890, it was formally accepted by the church membership, though many held reservations or abstained from voting.

Utah ratified its constitution in November 1895 and was granted statehood on January 4, 1896. One of the conditions for granting Utah statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into its state constitution.

==Text==
The Manifesto states:

To Whom It May Concern:

Press dispatches having been sent for political purposes, from Salt Lake City, which have been widely published, to the effect that the Utah Commission, in their recent report to the Secretary of the Interior, allege that plural marriages have been contracted in Utah since last June or during the past year, also that in public discourses the leaders of the Church have taught, encouraged and urged the continuance of the practice of polygamy—

I, therefore, as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, do hereby, in the most solemn manner, declare that these charges are false. We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory.

One case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the marriage was performed in the Endowment House, in Salt Lake City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without delay.

Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I hearby declare my intention to submit to those laws, to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.

There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey such teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.

Wilford Woodruff [signed]

President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==Formal acceptance by the LDS Church==
Less than a month after the Manifesto was issued, the LDS Church used the procedure of common consent to make it binding upon church members. At a general conference of the church in Salt Lake City on October 6, 1890, the Manifesto was read, after which Lorenzo Snow, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, made the following motion:

I move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the only man on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the sealing ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his position to issue the Manifesto which has been read in our hearing, and which is dated September 1890, and that as a Church in General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning plural marriages as authoritative and binding.

The conference proceedings recorded that &quot;the vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous.&quot; However, a modern author reports that &quot;at least some voted against the Manifesto and perhaps a majority abstained.&quot; Some members, including apostle Moses Thatcher, only reluctantly supported the Manifesto and interpreted it as a sign that the Second Coming of Jesus was imminent, after which plural marriage would be reinstated.

==New plural marriages vs. existing plural marriages==
The Manifesto was the end of official church authorization for the creation of new plural marriages that violated local laws. It had no effect on the status of already existing plural marriages, and plural marriages continued to be performed in locations where it was believed to be legal. As Woodruff explained at the general conference where the Manifesto was accepted by the church, &quot;[t]his Manifesto only refers to future marriages, and does not affect past conditions. I did not, I could not, and would not promise that you would desert your wives and children. This you cannot do in honor.&quot; Despite Woodruff&#x27;s explanation, some church leaders and members who were polygamous did begin to live with only one wife. However, the majority of Mormon polygamists continued to cohabit with their plural wives in violation of the Edmunds Act.

==Aftermath and post-Manifesto plural marriage==
Within six years of the announcement of the Manifesto, Utah had become a state and federal prosecution of Mormon polygamists subsided. However, Congress still refused to seat representatives-elect who were polygamists, including B. H. Roberts.

D. Michael Quinn and other Mormon historians have documented that some church apostles covertly sanctioned plural marriages after the Manifesto. This practice was especially prevalent in Mexico and Canada because of an erroneous belief that such marriages were legal in those jurisdictions. However, a significant minority were performed in Utah and other western American states and territories. The estimates of the number of post-Manifesto plural marriages performed range from scores to thousands, with the actual figure probably close to 250. Today, the LDS Church officially acknowledges that although the Manifesto &quot;officially ceased&quot; the practice of plural marriage in the church, &quot;the ending of the practice after the Manifesto was ... gradual.&quot;

Rumors of post-Manifesto marriages surfaced and began to be examined by Congress in the Reed Smoot hearings. In response, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a &quot;Second Manifesto&quot; in 1904 which reaffirmed the church&#x27;s opposition to the creation of new plural marriages and threatened excommunication for Latter-day Saints who continued to enter into or solemnize new plural marriages. Apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley both resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles due to disagreement with the church&#x27;s position on plural marriage. Plural marriage in violation of local law continues to be grounds for excommunication from the LDS Church.

The cessation of plural marriage within LDS Church gave rise to the Mormon fundamentalist movement.

==Evolution of Latter-day Saint views on the Manifesto==
The Manifesto has been canonized by the LDS Church, and its text appears in the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the church&#x27;s books of scripture. However, when the Manifesto was issued, it was not apparent that Woodruff or the other leaders of the LDS Church viewed it as the result of a divine revelation.

Approximately one year after he declared the Manifesto, Woodruff began to claim that he had received instructions from Jesus Christ that formed the basis of what he wrote in the text of the Manifesto. These instructions were reportedly accompanied by a vision of what would occur if the Manifesto were not issued.

Following Woodruff&#x27;s death in 1898, other church leaders began to teach that the Manifesto was the result of a revelation of God. Since that time, church leaders have consistently taught that the Manifesto was inspired of God. In 1908, the Manifesto was printed in the LDS Church&#x27;s Doctrine and Covenants for the first time, and it has been included in every edition since. A non-Mormon observer of the church has stated that &quot;[t]here is no question that, from a doctrinal standpoint, President Woodruff&#x27;s Manifesto now has comparable status with [Joseph Smith&#x27;s] revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants.&quot; Similarly, another writer has stated bluntly that &quot;contemporary Latter-day Saints regard the Manifesto as a revelation.&quot; The Manifesto is currently published as &quot;Official Declaration 1&quot; in the Doctrine and Covenants.

<doc id="1303925" wikidata="Q3334293" url="?curid=1303925" title="HMCS Goose Bay">
<text>HMCS &quot;Goose Bay&quot; is a that has served in the Canadian Forces since 1998. &quot;Goose Bay&quot; is the eighth ship of her class which is the name for the Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel Project. She is the first vessel to be named &quot;Goose Bay&quot;. The coastal defence vessel is assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and is homeported at CFB Halifax.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Kingston&quot; class was designed to fill the minesweeper, coastal patrol and reserve training needs of the Canadian Forces, replacing the s, s and Royal Canadian Mounted Police coastal launches in those roles. In order to perform these varied duties the &quot;Kingston&quot;-class vessels are designed to carry up to three ISO containers with power hookups on the open deck aft in order to embark mission-specific payloads. The seven module types available for embarkation include four route survey, two mechanical minesweeping and one bottom inspection modules.

The &quot;Kingston&quot; class displace and are long overall with a beam and a draught of . The coastal defence vessels are powered by four Jeumont ANR-53-50 alternators coupled to four Wärtsilä UD 23V12 diesel engines creating . Two LIPS Z-drive azimuth thrusters are driven by two Jeumont CI 560L motors creating and the Z drives can be rotated 360°. This gives the ships a maximum speed of and a range of at .

The &quot;Kingston&quot; class is equipped with a Kelvin Hughes navigational radar using the I band and a Kelvin Hughes 6000 surface search radar scanning the E and F bands. The vessels carry an AN/SQS-511 towed side scan sonar for minesweeping and a Remote-control Mine Hunting System (RMHS). The vessels are equipped with one Bofors 40 mm/60 calibre Mk 5C gun and two M2 machine guns. The 40 mm gun was declared obsolete and removed from the vessels in 2014. Some of them ended up as museum pieces and on display at naval reserve installations across Canada. The &quot;Kingston&quot;-class coastal defence vessels have a complement of 37.

==Service history==
&quot;Goose Bay&quot;″s keel was laid down on 22 February 1997 by Halifax Shipyards Ltd. at Halifax, Nova Scotia and was launched on 4 September 1997. The ship was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 26 July 1998 at Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador and carries the hull number MM 707.

In Fall 2000, the coastal defence vessel took part in the naval exercise Unified Spirit off the east coast of North America. From 23 April to 9 May 2001, &quot;Goose Bay&quot;, accompanied by sister ship , took part in the NATO naval exercise Blue Game off the coasts of Norway and Denmark. In August 2002, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; and sister ship sailed to Arctic waters as part of Operation Narwhal Ranger, a military exercise involving all arms of the Canadian Forces. This marked the first Arctic visit by naval vessels in thirteen years.

In August 2010 &quot;Goose Bay&quot; participated in Operation Nanook 2010, in the Canadian Arctic. This was the fourth annual joint exercise, and the first where foreign vessels participated. In 2012, the vessel deployed as part of Operation Caribbe, Canada&#x27;s participation in the war on drugs.

In February 2015, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; was deployed again to Operation Caribbe. In March 2015, as part of Operation Caribbe, &quot;Goose Bay&quot;, along with sister ship and the US Navy frigate , intercepted a vessel in the Caribbean Sea carrying of cocaine. On 8 September 2015, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; deployed for large NATO naval exercises Joint Warrior and Trident Venture with , , , and &quot;Summerside&quot;. In the summer of 2016, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; was sent on a goodwill tour of the Great Lakes, making several port visits. In July, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; visited her namesake port. In September &quot;Goose Bay&quot; was among the Canadian warships deployed to the NATO naval training exercise &quot;Cutlass Fury&quot; off the east coast of North America.

In June 2017, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; returned to the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway for a goodwill tour, making several port visits. In August &quot;Montréal&quot; and &quot;Goose Bay&quot; and sister ship departed Halifax to take part in the Operation Nanook in Canada&#x27;s northern waters.

In 2019, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; sailed to the Caribbean to take part in the naval exercise Tradewinds, training with other nation&#x27;s navies from the area. In 2021, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; and took part in Operation Nanook. &quot;Goose Bay&quot; was among the ships deployed to the Arctic for Operation Nanook in August 2022. In September 2022, &quot;Goose Bay&quot; was tasked for hurricane relief efforts, after Hurricane Fiona&#x27;s devastating impact to the Maritimes.

<doc id="1303931" wikidata="Q7055732" url="?curid=1303931" title="North Jersey Coast Line">
<text>The North Jersey Coast Line is a commuter rail line running from Rahway to Bay Head, New Jersey, traversing through the Jersey Shore region. Operated by New Jersey Transit, the line is electrified as far south as Long Branch. On rail system maps it is colored light blue, and its symbol is a sailboat. The line runs along the former New York &amp; Long Branch Railroad, which was co-owned by the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Most trains operate between New York Penn Station and Long Branch, with frequent rush-hour service and hourly local off-peak service. Diesel shuttle trains between Long Branch and Bay Head meet these electric trains, although a limited number of through trains operate during weekday rush hours between Bay Head and Pennsylvania Station, utilizing dual-mode engines. Hourly New York to Long Branch service operates on weekends, with bi-hourly diesel shuttle service (with some extra trains) between Long Branch and Bay Head. Full hourly service operates during the peak summer season. Some electric trains terminate at South Amboy and make all stops from New York Penn Station, providing local service for the Northeast Corridor stops of Rahway, Linden, Elizabeth, and North Elizabeth during rush hours. South Amboy is the local terminus for the NJCL.

==Service==

The line is double tracked, except for the bridge over the Manasquan River at Brielle. The line has cab signals and wayside block signals; the line from Rahway to Long Branch is signaled for operation in either direction on both tracks (NORAC Rule 261). Twelve interlockings facilitate flexibility in operation between the two tracks; these and other interlockings control movements to or from freight lines such as the Chemical Coast Secondary, the Amboy Secondary, and the Southern Secondary, as well as Long Branch Yard.

Passenger yards are at Long Branch and Bay Head. Long Branch Yard is fully electrified, and mostly interlocked. Bay Head contains a large balloon (circular looping) track where entire trains can reverse direction without backing up or uncoupling the locomotive, and obviating the need for a turntable. It remains in service, even though push-pull operation has eliminated the need for turning of trains. Bay Head Yard has no interlocking; all switches are hand-operated. A yard and sidings formerly existed at South Amboy, dating to when electrification ended there, but have since been removed; trains terminating at South Amboy cannot be bypassed by using the other track, as the new station has a single island platform.

Conrail Shared Assets Operations also operates over the North Jersey Coast Line to interchange with the Delaware and Raritan River Railroad in Red Bank.

===Movable bridges===

The North Jersey Coast Line has five movable bridges of the twelve used by the NJT rail network, the most on any one line.
* River Draw (swing) at Raritan Bay
* Morgan Draw (bascule) spans cross the Cheesequake or Morgan Creek
* Oceanport Draw (swing, with non-movable catenary) over the Shrewsbury River 
* the Shark River Draw (bascule) on Shark River
* Brielle Draw over the Manasquan River
All these bridges were originally double-track spans, but Brielle Draw has been single-tracked since the mid-1970s. The line also crosses over several other waterways on fixed bridges, the longest of which is over the Navesink River at Red Bank.

===Electrification===
The North Jersey Coast Line is electrified north of Long Branch.

Electrified operation between Rahway and South Amboy began about 1936. Electrification was extended to Matawan in 1982 (now called Aberdeen-Matawan), with catenary installed in the early 1980s. This was originally 11 kV, increased to 12 kV in 1978 along with Amtrak&#x27;s New York-Washington electrification, with insulators capable of supporting 25 kV. Electrification at 12.5 kV 60 Hz was extended to Long Branch in 1988, with catenary installed in 1986–88. As on the 1982 extension, the insulators can handle 25 kV. The catenary is self-adjusting (constant tensioning) with ambient temperature. In 2002, the voltage from Matawan to Long Branch was changed from 12.5 kV to 25 kV. As a result, the Arrow III passenger cars can no longer run between those two points, since those trains can not run on two different voltages on one trip (the transformer voltage taps must be manually changed from alongside the MU).

The line remains electrified at 12 kV 25 Hz AC north of Matawan. Three phase breaks segregate the different power sources, at the Matawan Phase Gap, Laurel Phase Gap (Hazlet/Holmdel), and east of Bergen Place in Red Bank.

==History==
With the completion of the Waterfront Connection in 1991, five weekday round trip diesel trains began running from Bay Head to Hoboken Terminal using the Waterfront Connection. On May 18, 2015, NJ Transit expanded service to include three inbound and three outbound weekday trains running from Bay Head directly to and from New York Penn Station.

===Commuter Clubs===

The line was home to the last remaining private commuter passenger club in the United States. The Jersey Shore Commuters Club was established in 1933 under the auspices of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It used half of a Comet IIM car - car 5459 (built as Comet IIB 5759 in 1988). In 2004, the Comet II Club Car went through a custom overhaul by Alstom and was furnished, with the club&#x27;s funding, to include reclining lounge chairs, spacious seating, at-seat fold down tables, and private conference tables. The club also hosted various onboard activities to preserve its heritage. Club members enjoyed guaranteed and spacious seating as part of their annual membership fee that the Club remitted to New Jersey Transit as part of its lease agreement. Membership was &quot;open&quot; and on a &quot;first come first served basis&quot; to those willing to pay the membership fee and abide by the club&#x27;s bylaws. The Club end of the car was furnished similar to Amtrak&#x27;s Amfleet and Horizon fleet of cars. The Club Car seats were actually former Amfleet Metroliner seats that the club had re-conditioned. The Club Car only ran during peak rush hour periods with one weekday round trip per day and was always run with the club end coupled to the locomotive when used. Due to damage sustained to the Club Car in Hurricane Sandy, the commuter club was disbanded in August 2013. Per posts on the club&#x27;s Facebook page, the Club Car took its last trip on the line in October 2012, just prior to the hurricane.

===Bergen Shore Express===
In the summers of 1986–1988, NJ Transit experimented with service from selected stops of the Bergen County Line, around the southwest curve of the West End Junction in Jersey City, and switching from the Morris &amp; Essex to the Northeast Corridor via a complicated set of switch maneuvers in the Newark area, then continuing express to the Coast Line, with no intermediate stops between Harmon Cove station and Long Branch station. Tickets were for a specified town and included bus service to the beach and beach admission passes. One round trip was made each Saturday and Sunday during July. Despite high demand (on sunny days), the service was discontinued, ostensibly due to crew and equipment shortages, and the inability to forecast demand. 

===Summer Shore Express===

In June 2014, NJ Transit began running one-seat limited-stop summer shore express trains to and from Bay Head and New York on weekends and holidays. This limited time service only ran through the summer and ended on September 1, 2014. This service was brought back for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 summer seasons. Service consisted of four inbound and outbound trips, with two trips during the morning, and two in the evening in both directions.

===Hurricane Sandy===

As a line paralleling the New Jersey coastline, the North Jersey Coast Line received exceptionally severe damage from Hurricane Sandy on October 29–30, 2012. Track was washed out in several places from Perth Amboy southward, most notably between South Amboy and Aberdeen-Matawan stations, where the line runs closest to the Atlantic Ocean. The Raritan Bay and Morgan Creek drawbridges were struck by boats, storage containers and other floating debris, knocking the bridges&#x27; tracks out of alignment. Trees also fell over parts of the line. Service remained suspended for three weeks; a resumption of service only as far as Woodbridge (and skipping Avenel) on November 4 was halted after only one day due to severe overcrowding. The Christie administration announced that most North Jersey Coast Line trains would return to service on Monday, November 19, with slightly longer trip times and omission of trains to Hoboken Terminal.

==Rolling stock==

Because of the complexity of electrification on the Coast Line, the route has among the most diverse fleet in the NJT system.

Between New York and Long Branch service is typically operated with an ALP-46 electric locomotive pulling Comet or MultiLevel coaches. Shuttle trains between Long Branch and Bay Head are typically operated with a PL42AC or GP40PH-2B diesel locomotive pulling 4 to 6 car sets of Comet series or MultiLevel coaches.

During weekday rush hours, NJ Transit operates &quot;One Seat Ride&quot; services between New York and Bay Head. These trains use ALP-45DP dual-power locomotives that can run on either electric power supplied by overhead lines or from an on-board diesel generator. They are paired with an 8-car set of Comet series or MultiLevel coaches.

NJ Transit also operates short turn runs between New York and South Amboy during weekday rush hours. These services can use Arrow III railcars. Because of the voltage change at Matawan, Arrow railcars cannot operate further south, as they are not capable of in motion voltage changes like the ALP-45 and ALP-46 locomotives.

<doc id="1303936" wikidata="Q1050326" url="?curid=1303936" title="Hamengkubuwono">
<text>Hamengkubuwono () is the current ruling royal house of the Yogyakarta Sultanate in the Special Region of Yogyakarta of Indonesia. The reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta is the hereditary Governor of the Special Region (Act No. 13 of 2012, article 18 paragraph 1c) with terms of 5 years (article 25 paragraph 1) without bounded by periodic provision (article 25 paragraph 2), as normally applied to such public office. The current Sultan is Hamengkubuwono X.

==Honorifics==
As with many significant historical and respected figures in Javanese culture, the name of a ruler is usually preceded by honorifics – in most cases the usage is of &quot;Sri Sultan&quot; before the name. In full titles the first Hamengkubuwono was titled:

&quot;Ngarsadalem Sampeyandalem Hingkang Sinuhun Kangjeng Sultan Hamengkubuwono, Senopati Ing Ngalaga Ngabdurrahman Sayidin Panatagama Kalifatulah, Hingkang Jumeneng Kaping I&quot;.

==Etymology ==

For some Javanese, the name has been interpreted as having the following components:
*Hamangku: pleased to serve the people
*Hamengku: protect the people in a just way
*Hamengkoni: ready to take responsibility of a leader
*Buwono: the Javanese universe
Such an explanation does not necessarily coincide with strict etymology of the word.

<doc id="1303937" wikidata="Q2111860" url="?curid=1303937" title="Bat-Mite">
<text>Bat-Mite is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Bat-Mite is an imp similar to the Superman villain Mister Mxyzptlk. Depicted as a small, childlike man in an ill-fitting copy of Batman&#x27;s costume, Bat-Mite possesses what appear to be near-infinite magical powers which could be considered nigh-omnipotence, but he actually uses highly advanced technology from the fifth dimension that cannot be understood by humans&#x27; limited three-dimensional views. Unlike Mxyzptlk, Bat-Mite idolizes his superhero target and thus he has visited Batman on various occasions, often setting up strange and ridiculous events so that he could see his hero in action. Bat-Mite is more of a nuisance than a supervillain, and often departs of his own accord upon realizing that he has angered his idol.

Bat-Mite has appeared in various media outside comics, primarily in association with Batman. Paul Reubens and Lou Scheimer voice the character in &quot;&quot; and &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot; respectively.

==Publication history==
Bat-Mite made his first appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #267 (May 1959) in a story titled &quot;Batman Meets Bat-Mite&quot;, and was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Sheldon Moldoff.

Bat-Mite was retired from the comic in 1964, when editor Julius Schwartz instituted a &quot;New Look&quot; Batman that shed some of the sillier elements in the series.

Bat-Mite appeared in a self-titled six-issue miniseries which lasted from June to November 2015.

==Fictional character history==
===Pre-Crisis===
Bat-Mite regularly appeared in &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, and &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; for five years. Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk teamed up four times in the pages of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; to plague Superman and Batman together, as well. In 1964, the Batman titles were revamped under editor Julius Schwartz, leading Bat-Mite to stop appearing.

===Post-Crisis===
Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity reboot, Bat-Mite is largely removed from DC&#x27;s continuity. He appears in the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; special &quot;World&#x27;s Funnest&quot; before being restored to the main continuity in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #25 (2006). Furthermore, Bat-Mite appears as a hallucination that Batman suffers after losing his sanity during Grant Morrison&#x27;s run.

==Powers and abilities==
Bat-Mite, as a fifth-dimensional Imp, has nigh-omnipotence, which is shown as near-infinite magical power. Bat-Mite has powers and skills identical to that of Mister Mxyzptlk (but not his weaknesses), such as the ability to manipulate spacetime. He has access to various bat-weapons like his hero, Batman.

==Reception==
In &quot;Handbook of Comics and Graphic Narratives&quot;, Matt Yockey writes, &quot;Bat-Mite pointedly represents the intersection of utopia and trauma in the superhero genre and he signals that the mastery over trauma is an essential step toward realizing a utopian ideal. His home in the &#x27;fifth dimension&#x27; and his magical powers locate Bat-Mite in the utopian realm, yet he turns to Batman as his ideal, suggesting that contact with trauma is in fact indispensable to the expression of a utopian desire.&quot;
