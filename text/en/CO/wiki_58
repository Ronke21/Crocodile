<text>Ustad Amir Khan (; 15 August 1912 – 13 February 1974) was an Indian singer and musician in the Hindustani classical tradition. He was the founder of the Indore gharana.

==Early life and background==
Amir Khan was born in a family of musicians in Kalanaur, India. His father, Shahmir Khan, a sarangi and veena player of the Bhendibazaar gharana, served at the court of the Holkars of Indore. His grandfather, Change Khan, was a singer in the court of Bahadurshah Zafar. Amir Ali&#x27;s mother died when he was nine years old. He had a younger brother, Bashir, who went on to become a sarangi player at the Indore station of All India Radio.

He was initially trained in the sarangi by his father. However, seeing his interest in vocal music, his father gradually devoted more time to vocal training, focusing on the merukhand technique. Amir Khan was exposed at an early age to many different styles, since just about every musician who visited Indore would come to their house, and there would be mehfils at their place on a regular basis. He also learned the basics of tabla playing from one of his maternal uncles, who was a tabla player.

Amir Khan moved to Bombay in 1934, and there he gave a few concerts and cut about half a dozen 78-rpm records. These initial performances were not well received. Following his father&#x27;s advice, in 1936 he joined the services of Maharaj Chakradhar Singh of Raigadh Sansthan in Madhya Pradesh. He performed at a music conference in Mirzapur on behalf of the Raja, with many illustrious musicians present, but he was hooted off the stage after only 15 minutes or so. The organizer suggested singing a thumri, but he refused, saying that his mind was never really inclined towards thumri. He stayed at Raigadh for only about a year. Amir Khan&#x27;s father died in 1937. Later, Khansahib lived for some time in Delhi and Calcutta, but after the partition of India he moved back to Bombay.

==Singing career==
Amir Khan was a virtually self-taught musician. He developed his own &quot;gayaki&quot; (singing style), influenced by the styles of Abdul Waheed Khan (&quot;vilambit&quot; tempo), Rajab Ali Khan (&quot;taans&quot;) and Aman Ali Khan (merukhand). This unique style, known as the Indore Gharana, blends the spiritual flavour and grandeur of dhrupad with the ornate vividness of khyal. The style he evolved was a unique fusion of intellect and emotion, of technique and temperament, of talent and imagination. Unlike other artists he never made any concessions to popular tastes, but always stuck to his pure, almost puritanical, highbrow style.

Amir Khansahib had a rich baritone open-throated voice with a three-octave range. His voice had some limitations but he turned them fruitfully and effortlessly to his advantage. He presented an aesthetically detailed &quot;badhat&quot; (progression) in &quot;ati-vilambit laya&quot; (very slow tempo) using &quot;bol-alap&quot; with merukhandi patterns, followed by gradually speeding up &quot;floating&quot; &quot;sargams&quot; with various ornamentations, &quot;taans&quot; and &quot;bol-taans&quot; with complex and unpredictable movements and jumps while preserving the raga structure, and finally a &quot;madhyalaya&quot; or &quot;drut laya&quot; (medium or fast tempo) chhota khyal or a ruba&#x27;idar tarana. He helped popularize the tarana, as well as khyalnuma compositions in the Dari variant of Persian. While he was famous for his use of merukhand, he did not do a purely merukhandi &quot;alap&quot; but rather inserted merukhandi passages throughout his performance. He believed that practising &quot;gamak&quot; is essential to mastering singing.

Khansahib often used the &quot;taals&quot; Jhoomra and Ektaal, and generally preferred a simple &quot;theka&quot; (basic tabla strokes that define the &quot;taal&quot;) from the tabla accompanist. Even though he had been trained in the sarangi, he generally performed khyals and taranas with only a six-stringed tanpura and tabla for accompaniment. Sometimes he had a subdued harmonium accompaniment, but he almost never used the sarangi.

While he could do traditional &quot;layakari&quot; (rhythmic play), including &quot;bol-baant&quot;, which he has demonstrated in a few recordings, he generally favored a &quot;swara&quot;-oriented and &quot;alap&quot;-dominated style, and his &quot;layakari&quot; was generally more subtle. His performances had an understated elegance, reverence, restrained passion and an utter lack of showmanship that both moved and awed listeners. According to Kumarprasad Mukhopadhyay&#x27;s book &quot;The Lost World of Hindustani Music&quot;, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan&#x27;s music was extroverted, exuberant and a crowd-puller, whereas Amir Khan&#x27;s was an introverted, dignified &quot;darbar&quot; style. Amir Khansahib believed that poetry was important in khyal compositions, and with his pen name, Sur Rang (&quot;colored in swara&quot;), he has left several compositions.

He believed in competition between the genres of classical music and film and other popular music, and he felt that classical renderings needed to be made more beautiful while remaining faithful to the spirit and grammar of the raga (&quot;बाज़ लोग ऐसे थे के जो खूब्सूरती बनाने के लिये वो राग को ज़रा इधर-उधर कर दिया करते थे, लेकिन मै यह कोशीश करता हूं के ज़्यादा से ज़्यादा राग खूब्सूरत हो लेकिन राग अप्नी जगह राग रहे&quot;). He used to say, &quot;नग़मा वही नग़मा है जो रूह सुने और रूह सुनाए&quot; (نغمہ وہی نغمہ ہے جو روح سنے اور روح سناہے ; music is that which originates from the heart and touches the soul).

Characteristics of his style include:
* slow-tempo, leisurely raga development (except with Carnatic ragas, which he typically rendered in medium tempo)
* improvisation mostly in lower and middle octaves
* tendency towards serious and expansive ragas
* emphasis on melody
* clarity of notes
* judicious use of pause between improvisations
* bol alap and sargam using merukhand patterns
* using sargam in taan-ang
* using softer gamaks
* sparing application of murki
* use of kan swaras (acciaccatura) in all parts of performance
* controlled use of embellishments to preserve introspective quality
* rare use of tihai
* careful enunciation of text of bandish
* actual bandish as sung may or may not include antara
* multiple laya jatis in a single taan&lt;note&gt;Khansahib demonstrated this in an interview with the tabla player Chatturlal&lt;/note&gt;
* mixture of taan types (including chhoot, sapaat, bal, sargam and bol-taan) in a single taan
* use of ruba&#x27;idar tarana (considered similar to chhota khyal)

Besides singing in concerts, Amir Khan also sang film songs in ragas, in a purely classical style, most notably for the films &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot;, &quot;Shabaab&quot; and &quot;Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje&quot;. This attempt to introduce classical music to the masses through films significantly boosted Khansahib&#x27;s visibility and popularity. He also sang a ghazal &quot;Rahiye Ab Aisi Jagah&quot; for a documentary on Ghalib.

Khansahib&#x27;s disciples include Amarnath, Sangeetacharya Usha Ranjan Mukherjee, A. Kanan, Ajit Singh Paintal, Akhtar Sadmani, Amarjeet Kaur, Bhimsen Sharma, Gajendra Bakshi, Hridaynath Mangeshkar, Kamal Bose, Kankana Banerjee, Mukund Goswami, Munir Khan, Pradyumna Kumud Mukherjee and Poorabi Mukherjee, Kamal Bandhopadhyay, Shankar Mazumdar, Shankar Lal Mishra, Singh Brothers, Srikant Bakre and Thomas Ross. His style has also influenced many other singers and instrumentalists, including Bhimsen Joshi, Gokulotsavji Maharaj, Mahendra Toke, Prabha Atre, Rashid Khan, Ajoy Chakrabarty, Rasiklal Andharia, Sanhita Nandi, Shanti Sharma, Nikhil Banerjee, Pannalal Ghosh, the Imdadkhani gharana, and Sultan Khan. Although he referred to his style as the Indore Gharana, he was a firm believer of absorbing elements from various gharanas.

Amir Khan was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1967 and the Padma Bhushan in 1971.

==Research in the field of Tarana==
Ustad Amir Khan dedicated a large part of his musical career to the study of taranas. In his research, he found that the words used in Tarana come from Persian and Arabic languages. In one of his research articles he explained their meanings as follows:

Tanan Dar Aa - Enter my body.

O Dani - He knows

Tu Dani - You know.

Na Dir Dani - You are the Complete Wisdom.

Tom - I am yours, I belong to you.

Yala - Ya Allah

Yali - Ya Ali

In another interview, he also states the meaning of the following syllables:

Dar – Bheetar, Aandar (inside)

Dara – Andar Aa (get in or come inside)

Dartan – Tanke Aandar (inside the body)

Tanandara – Tanke Aandar Aa (Come inside the body)

Tom – Main Tum Hun (I am you)

Nadirdani – Tu Sabse Adhik Janata Hai (You know more than anyone else)

Tandardani – Tanke Aandarka Jannewala (One who knows what is inside the body)

==Personal life==
Amir Khan&#x27;s first marriage was to Zeenat, sister of the sitar player, Vilayat Khan. From this marriage, which eventually failed and ended in separation, he had a daughter, Farida. His second marriage was to Munni Bai, who gave birth to a son, Akram Ahmed. Around 1965, Khansaheb married Raisa Begum, daughter of the thumri singer, Mushtari Begum of Agra. He had expected that Munni Begum would accept the third wife; however, Munni disappeared and it is rumored that she committed suicide. With Raisa he had a son, Haider Amir, later called Shahbaz Khan.

Khansahib died in a car accident in Calcutta on 13 February 1974 aged 61, and was buried at Calcutta&#x27;s Gobra cemetery.

<text>Piazzi Smyth is a small lunar impact crater in the eastern part of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth. This is an isolated feature located about 100 kilometers to the southwest of the Montes Alpes mountain range. To the southeast of this crater is Mons Piton, an isolated mountain that rises to a height of 2.3 km and occupies a diameter of about 25 km.
This crater is a nicely circular feature with a rim and interior that have not been significantly modified by impacts. The inner walls slope smoothly downwards to the small floor about the midpoint, which occupies a diameter of only one-fifth the total diameter of the crater. This formation has no other notable features, and its albedo matches the surrounding lava plain.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Piazzi Smyth.

<doc id="1290362" wikidata="Q1305775" url="?curid=1290362" title="J Mays">
<text>J Carrol Mays is a retired American industrial designer who served as Group Vice President of Global Design and Chief Creative Officer at Ford Motor Company, and was Chief Design Officer at Whirlpool. His name is simply &quot;J&quot;, after his grandfather, S J Mays.

==Background==
Born in rural Oklahoma, Mays started working at his family&#x27;s auto parts store at an early age. While attending Maysville High School in Maysville, Oklahoma, Mays enrolled in an occupational drafting program at Mid-America Technology Center in Wayne, with aspirations of architecture. After high school, he studied commercial art at the University of Oklahoma before briefly switching to journalism. In 1976, he transferred to the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California, graduating in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science degree in transportation design.

==Career==
===Volkswagen Group and BMW===

Mays began his career as an exterior designer at AUDI AG, a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group, in Ingolstadt, Germany. While there he worked on the design of the 1986 Audi 80 B3. After a brief stint in 1983 at BMW in Munich where he worked on designs for the 5 Series E34 and 8 Series cars, he returned to Audi the following year as senior designer, where he worked on the design of the Audi 100 C4, Volkswagen Golf III and Volkswagen Polo.

In 1991, the Mays-designed Audi Avus quattro concept car was unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show. The Avus, named for the 1930s grand-prix racetrack in Berlin evoked the design of the German speed-record cars and gran turismo roadsters of the 1930s. The Avus proved to be significant for both Audi and Mays. The form of the Avus led to the development of Audi&#x27;s TT, designed by Mays&#x27; Art Center colleague Freeman Thomas, later to become head of Ford&#x27;s Strategic Design in 2005.
Mays moved back to the United States in 1989, to become chief designer at the Volkswagen of America Design Center in Simi Valley, California. While there, he collaborated with Thomas on the design of the Volkswagen Concept 1 concept car, a modern re-interpretation of the original Volkswagen Beetle. This was first shown at the 1994 North American International Auto Show, and the positive response led to the car entering production as the Volkswagen New Beetle.

He returned to Germany in 1993 as Audi&#x27;s design director responsible for the company&#x27;s worldwide design strategy, development and execution.

===SHR Perceptual Management===
In 1995, Mays became vice president of Design Development for SHR Perceptual Management, a consultancy that worked for numerous automotive companies, including Ford.

===Ford Motor Company: 1997-2013===
Replacing Jack Telnack as global Vice President of Design of the Ford Motor Company in 1997, Mays became responsible for the design direction of Ford Motor Company&#x27;s eight brands (Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda, Volvo, Land Rover, Jaguar, and Aston Martin). He was responsible for a number of concept car designs, including the Ford Fairlane, Shelby GR-1, 021C and &quot;427&quot;, Jaguar F-Type and Volvo SCC. Mays has been involved in the design of numerous production models, including the Aston Martin DB9, Land Rover LR3/Discovery, Ford GT, Ford Shelby GT500, 2005 Ford Five Hundred, 2011 Ford Fiesta, 2012 Focus, 2015 Ford Mustang, and 2015 Ford F-150.

While at Ford, Mays has received several professional awards and recognition for his designs. In November 2002, Mays&#x27; designs were the subject of an exhibition, &quot;Retrofuturism: The Car Design of J Mays&quot; at the Geffen Contemporary of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. He also received the Harvard Design School annual Excellence in Design Award in February 2002, and in September 2002, the Don Kubly Professional Attainment Award from the Art Center College of Design.

On 1 November 2011, Mays announced that the next generation Australian Ford Falcon, expected after 2015, is likely to be front-wheel drive or front-wheel drive based &#x27;all-wheel drive&#x27;.

At the 2011 Los Angeles auto show, Mays talked about the advancement of technology integrated into Ford&#x27;s production line, and how that has driven vehicle design, especially interior design. Mays retired from Ford at the end of 2013 and was replaced by Moray Callum, an accomplished designer in his own right (he worked with Tesla chief designer Franz von Holzhausen when both were at Mazda) and the younger brother of famed Jaguar creative lead Ian Callum.

===Pixar===

John Lasseter approached J Mays to work with Pixar as a design consultant during his times at Ford and RCA. Having originally helped during the production of Cars, he had gone on to continue involvement with several other movies, including designing the robot for Big Hero 6 and the vehicles in Zootopia.

===Vehicle Design and Intelligent Mobility course at Royal College of Art===

Beginning from September 2015, J Mays started contributing to the Royal College of Art&#x27;s prestigious Vehicle Design programme as a visiting professor. The course was later renamed to Intelligent Mobility from 2018.

===Whirlpool===
In September 2018, Whirlpool announced Mays as its new VP and chief design officer. Mays retired at the end of 2021.

<doc id="1290363" wikidata="Q3268820" url="?curid=1290363" title="History of Christian universalism">
<text>The doctrine of Christian universalism has been rejected by most mainstream Christian churches, which tend to maintain at least the possibility that many will not be saved, but it has received support from many prestigious Christian thinkers as well as many groups of Christians. It has been argued that the Bible itself has a variety of verses that seem to support a plurality of views.

Universal salvation may be related to the perception of a problem of Hell, standing opposed to ideas such as endless torment in Hell, but may also include a period of finite punishment similar to a state of purgatory. Believers in universal reconciliation may believe that while there is a real &quot;Hell&quot; of some kind it is neither a place of endless suffering nor a place where the spirits of human beings are ultimately &quot;annihilated&quot; after enduring the just amount of divine retribution.

Universalists espouse various theological beliefs concerning the process or state of salvation, but all adhere to the view that salvation history concludes with the reconciliation of the entire human race to God. Many adherents assert that the suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ constitute the mechanism that provides redemption for all humanity and atonement for all sins.

Modern Unitarian Universalism emerged in part from the Universalist Church but, being a non-credal faith, it holds no official doctrinal positions. Universal reconciliation, however, remains a popular viewpoint among many of its congregations and individual believers, including many who have not associated with the Universalist Church.

==Biblical background==

As David Fisher, a bishop and professor of philosophy has put it, &quot;In the final analysis, the question of salvation is always an inquiry into the balancing of human free will with God&#x27;s mercy and forgiveness.&quot; The Bible itself has, as referred to before, a variety of verses on the subject that appear to be contradictory if not given additional reader interpretation. Influential theologians Emil Brunner and J.A.T. Robinson argue that these verses can be put into two distinct categories: damnation for some or eventual reconciliation for all.

According to biblical scholar David Sim, Paul does not seem to believe in an eternal hell but rather annihilationism, while Matthew does. 

As well, the Epistle to the Colossians receives attention, with Colossians 1:17–20 reading:
==Development of universalist arguments==
Broadly speaking, most historical advocates of Christian universalism throughout the years (and many now still) did so from the perspective of accepting the traditional Biblical canon as divinely inspired and without transcription error but rejecting strict Biblical literalism, practicing detailed exegesis of the texts. The advocates have argued that the apparent contradiction between Bible verses that describe God eventually reconciling humanity to goodness (such as in the Epistle to the Ephesians) with those that describe damnation to most of humanity (such as in the Book of Revelation) is that threats of long-term punishment function just as threats, not necessarily as predictions of future events, that will not be actually carried out. Advocates have also argued that suffering of sinners in hell or hell-like states will be long but still limited, not eternal (Apocatastasis).

However, liberal and progressive Christians have often argued that the teachings of the historical Jesus did not mention exclusive salvation for a select few and have altogether rejected many sections of the Bible written by figures decades after the life of Jesus as man-made inventions that are to be taken with a grain of salt.

While not being a universalist per se, influential Christian philosopher Karl Barth, often regarded as the greatest Protestant theologian of the twentieth century, spoke for a great deal of broadly traditional Christians when he wrote that salvation is centrally Christological. He asserted that in Jesus Christ, the reconciliation of all of mankind to God has essentially already taken place and that through Christ man is already elect and justified. Therefore, eternal salvation for everyone, even those that reject God, is a possibility that is more than an open question but should be hoped for by Christians as a matter of grace.

===Responses===
One recurrent objection to universalism made by many has been that having a deep-rooted belief in eternal torment as a possibility is a necessary deterrent from living an immoral life.

Universalists have often responded that punishments for sin can function well without being eternal, especially in the afterlife when one can face severe treatment first before one eventually gets to heaven.

==History==

===Early Christianity===
According to Edward Beecher and George T. Knight, in the first 600 years of Christian history there were six main theological schools: four of them were universalist, one taught annihilationism and the last taught endless torment. Marcion, a second-century heretic, formulated universalistic theories about God. But many early Church Fathers have been quoted as either embracing or hoping for the ultimate reconciliation of all creatures with God as well. The concept of a final restoration of all souls had large appeal particularly in the East during the fourth and fifth centuries. Even in the West at that time, according to St. Augustine of Hippo, &quot;very many&quot; refused to believe in the eternal punishment and softened the harder statements of Holy Scripture by interpreting them as non-literal threats and invoking passages speaking of mercy, and St. Jerome wrote that &quot;many&quot; believed that even the devil &quot;will repent and be restored to his former place.&quot;

====Alexandria====
The most important school of Universalist thought was the Didascalium in Alexandria, Egypt, which was founded by Saint Pantaenus in about 190. Alexandria was the centre of learning and intellectual discourse in the ancient Mediterranean world, and it was the theological centre of gravity of Christianity prior to the rise of the Roman Church.

====Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215)====
The Universalists Hosea Ballou (1829), Thomas Whittemore (1830), John Wesley Hanson (1899) and George T. Knight (1911) claimed that Clement of Alexandria expressed universalist positions in early Christianity. Such claims have always been controversial. Some scholars believe that Clement used the term &quot;apokatastasis&quot; to refer primarily to the restoration of a select few, but with universal implications. Brian E. Daley writes that Clement viewed &quot;punishment after death as a medicinal and therefore temporary measure&quot; and that he suggested &quot;with great caution the related prospect of universal salvation for all intelligent creatures&quot;, for example in his &quot;Stromateis&quot;, Book VII, Chapter 2.

====Origen (c. 185 – 254)====
According to Daley, Origen was firmly convinced that &quot;all human souls will ultimately be saved&quot; and &quot;united to God forever in loving contemplation&quot; and that this is &quot;an indispensable part of the &#x27;end&#x27; promised by Paul in I Cor 15.24–28.&quot; Daley also notes that Origen sometimes called this final state of universal salvation &quot;ἀποκατάστασις&quot; and suggested it was already a familiar concept to his readers.

Frederick W. Norris maintained, however, that Origen may not have strongly believed in universal reconciliation at all. In an article on apokatastasis in &quot;The Westminster Handbook to Origen&quot; (2004) he wrote, &quot;As far as we can tell, therefore, Origen never decided to stress exclusive salvation or universal salvation, to the strict exclusion of either case.&quot;

====Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 – 390s)====
Gregory of Nyssa, who was declared &quot;the father of fathers&quot; by the Seventh Ecumenical Council, is interpreted by many scholars as a proponent of universal salvation

Gregory stated, &quot;when death approaches to life, and darkness to light, and the corruptible to the incorruptible, the inferior is done away with and reduced to non-existence, and the thing purged is benefited, just as the dross is purged from gold by fire. In the same way in the long circuits of time, when the evil of nature which is now mingled and implanted in them has been taken away, whensoever the restoration to their old condition of the things that now lie in wickedness takes place, there will be a unanimous thanksgiving from the whole creation, both of those who have been punished in the purification and of those who have not at all needed purification.&quot;

===6th century – Ecumenical condemnation of universalism?===
Apokatastasis was interpreted by 19th-century Universalists such as Hosea Ballou (1842) to be the same as the beliefs of the Universalist Church of America. However, until the middle of the 6th century, the word had a broader meaning. While it applied to a number of doctrines regarding salvation, it also referred to a return to both a location and an original condition. Thus, the Greek word&#x27;s application was originally broad and metaphorical. Many heteroclite views became associated with Origen, and the 15 anathemas against him attributed to the Second Council of Constantinople condemned a form of apokatastasis, along with the pre-existence of the soul, animism, a heterodox Christology, and a denial of real and lasting resurrection of the body. Some authorities believe that the anathemas belong to an earlier local synod.

The New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia claims that the Fifth Ecumenical Council was contested as being an official and authorized Ecumenical Council since it was established not by the Pope but the Emperor since the Pope resisted it. The Fifth Ecumenical Council addressed what was called &quot;The Three Chapters&quot; and was against a form of Origenism that had nothing to do with Origen and Origenist views. Popes Vigilius, Pelagius I (556–61), Pelagius II (579–90), and Gregory the Great (590–604) were aware only that the Fifth Council specifically dealt with the Three Chapters, and they neither mentioned Origenism or Universalism and nor spoke as if they knew of its condemnation even though Gregory the Great was opposed to the belief of universalism. Scholar Richard Bauckham stated that while universalism appeared &quot;discredited&quot; because of scholarly resistance to Origen&#x27;s view, it &quot;seems in doubt&quot; if the Fifth Ecumenical Council specifically endorsed any negative view of it.

===7th century – Isaac of Nineveh===
The universal reconciliation was strongly advocated in the writings of St. Isaac the Syrian, a monastic theologian and bishop of Nineveh.

===Middle Ages===
The Universalist John Wesley Hanson stated that even after eternal hell became the normative position of the Church, there were still some Christian thinkers during the Middle Ages who embraced Universalist ideas. In his Schaff article George T. Knight stated that &quot;maybe&quot; Johannes Scotus Eriugena, Johannes Tauler, Blessed John of Ruysbroeck and Blessed Julian of Norwich had Universalist leanings.

Solomon of Akhlat, a thirteenth-century bishop of the Church of the East, defended universalism in his Book of the Bee, mostly basing himself on citations of Isaac of Nineveh, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Diodorus of Tarsus. David Bentley Hart confirms this and adds that Timotheus II, a fourteenth-century patriarch of the said church, &quot;thought it uncontroversial to assert that the aiōnios pains of hell will come to an end when the souls cleansed by them, through the prayers of the saints, enter paradise.&quot;

===16th century – Reformation era===
The period between the Reformation and the Age of Enlightenment featured extended debates about salvation and hell, but although figures such as Erasmus rekindled interests in the Greek Church Fathers, and early advocates of universal salvation, such as Origen, became more broadly known as new editions of their writings were published, the universal restoration was not a doctrine that mainstream Reformers wished to restore. Nonetheless, even as the Augsburg Confession promulgates endless torment, it condemns &quot;Anabaptists, who think that there will be an end to the punishments of condemned men and devils.&quot;

Joachim Vadian and Johann Kessler accused the German Anabaptist Hans Denck of teaching universal salvation, and modern universalists have embraced him, but some research suggests that he in fact did not teach it though he hoped for it. However, that research overlooks Denck&#x27;s profession of universalism in Sigelsbach&#x27;s sympathetic account of his conversation with him. Furthermore, despite initially denying his universalism before Urbanus Rhegius, teary-eyed Denck then allegedly confessed his belief &quot;that no man or devil was eternally damned&quot;, and appealed to biblical sayings about God&#x27;s mercy (though he did believe in a painful hell). Moreover, after Denck&#x27;s death, universalism was reportedly professed by an Anabaptist imprisoned for heresy in 1528, and Denck&#x27;s student Clement Ziegler published two treatises defending it in 1532, but would keep quiet about it the last 20 years of his life. Other Anabaptists like Balthasar Hubmaier or Melchior Hoffman did not teach universalism but a doctrine similar to Arminianism.

===17th century===
The 17th century saw a resurgence of Christian universalism:
* Gerrard Winstanley, &quot;The Mysterie of God Concerning the Whole Creation, Mankinde&quot; (London, 1648).
* Richard Coppin, &quot;A hint of the glorious mysterie of the divine teachings&quot; (1649), defended at Worcester Assizes, 1652.
* Jane Leade, &quot;A Revelation of the Everlasting Gospel Message&quot; (1697).
* Jeremiah White, chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, wrote a book, &quot;The Restoration of all things&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1712 after his death in 1707.

Prominent universalists of this time also include the Cambridge Platonists in 17th-century England such as Peter Sterry.

The rise of ideological Calvinism, which taught that God neither sought out nor wanted salvation for all mankind and strictly held that divine omnipotence meant that God created those that he foresaw damnation for without mercy, fueled an intellectual counterreaction in which universalist-like doctrines that God intended all of humanity to be saved and will extend grace to most of humanity gained appeal. Arminianism and Quaker doctrine received much attention, but Christian universalism was still a fringe phenomenon in terms of scholarly thinking at the time.

===18th century in Great Britain===
Biblical scholar Richard Bauckham offered an academic survey of the history of the re-arising of the belief in Universal Salvation:
George Whitfield, in a letter to John Wesley, wrote that Peter Bohler, a bishop in the Moravian Church, had privately confessed in a letter that &quot;all the damned souls would hereafter be brought out of hell&quot;. William Law in &quot;An Humble, Earnest, and Affectionate Address to the Clergy&quot; (1761), an Anglican, and James Relly, a Welsh Methodist, were other significant 18th-century Protestant leaders who believed in Universalism.

In 1843, the Universalist Rev J. M. Day published an article &quot;Was John Wesley a Restorationist?&quot; in the &quot;Universalist Union&quot; magazine, suggesting that John Wesley (d. 1791) had made a private conversion to Universalism in his last years but had kept it secret. Biographers of Wesley reject that claim.

===18th century in North America===

Universalism was brought to the North American colonies in the early 18th century by the English-born physician George de Benneville, who was attracted by Pennsylvania&#x27;s Quaker tolerance. North American universalism was active and organized. That was seen as a threat by the orthodox, Calvinist Congregationalists of New England such as Jonathan Edwards, who wrote prolifically against universalist teachings and preachers. John Murray (1741–1815) and Elhanan Winchester (1751–1797) are usually credited as founders of the modern Universalist movement and founding teachers of universal salvation. Early American Universalists such as Elhanan Winchester continued to preach the punishment of souls prior to eventual salvation.

===19th century===
The 19th century was the heyday of Christian universalism and the Universalist Church of America.

The famous German philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher became one of the most well-known religious thinkers to teach universalism. Though he somewhat shared John Calvin&#x27;s view of predestination, he interpreted the concept of an all-determining will of God to mean that through God&#x27;s might, power, and foresight, humanity as a whole is fundamentally united in God&#x27;s view and that every single person will eventually be drawn into His irresistible influence.

Other examples include English theologian Henry Bristow Wilson, who took somewhat of a universalist viewpoint in his part of the famous 1860 work &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; and became condemned in the Court of Arches (an ecclesiastical court of the Church of England), only to soon receive vindication when the Lord Chancellor overturned that condemnation. Frederic Farrar&#x27;s famous series of sermons in Westminster Abbey in 1877, published in print as &quot;Eternal Hope&quot; a year later, disputed the traditional views of damnation and punishment.

===20th century===
While highly influential Protestant theologians Karl Barth and Emil Brunner did not strictly identify as universalists, both wrote in detail about how they viewed complete salvation extended to every single member of mankind as being not just a distinct possibility but as something that should be hoped for by all Christians.

The Universalist Church of America merged with the American Unitarian Association in 1961 to form the Unitarian Universalists.

Hans Urs von Balthasar wrote a small book addressing the virtuous hope for universalism, as well as its origin in Origen, &quot;Dare We Hope &quot;That All Men Be Saved&quot;?&quot;. He also addressed the relationship between love and universalism in &quot;Love Alone is Credible&quot;.

Adolph E. Knoch and William Barclay were universalists. In 1919, the Swiss F. L. Alexandre Freytag led a breakaway group of the Bible Student movement.

Children&#x27;s author Madeleine L&#x27;Engle (&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;) was an advocate of universalism, which led several Christian retail outlets to refuse to stock her books.

In the late 1990s, theologian Max King introduced a doctrine called &quot;Transmillennialism&quot;, which was an extension of the preterist system of eschatology, that held the two covenants overlapped during the times of the New Testament, and the final end of the old age, and judgment portrayed in Revelation and elsewhere, was fulfilled by the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in AD70. With God&#x27;s wrath &quot;completed&quot; in that, a &quot;comprehensive grace&quot; then spread unconditionally to all.

===21st century===
Christian Universalism continues as an influence within not only Unitarian Universalism but also Trinitarian Universalism.

In 2004, the Pentecostal bishop Carlton Pearson received notoriety when he was officially declared a heretic by the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops. Bishop Pearson, who had attended Oral Roberts University, a Charismatic Christian college, formally declared his belief in the doctrine of universal salvation. His church, called the New Dimensions Church, adopted that doctrine (that is, those who remained, since a significant majority of the church&#x27;s original membership left), and in 2008, the congregation was merged into All Souls Unitarian Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, one of the largest Unitarian Universalist congregations in the world.

&quot;The Evangelical Universalist: The Biblical Hope That God&#x27;s Love Will Save us All&quot;, by &quot;Gregory MacDonald&quot;, was published in 2006. &quot;Gregory MacDonald&quot; is a pen name, and the book&#x27;s author was later revealed to be Robin Parry. The same author is also a coeditor of a 2003 compilation, &quot;Universal Salvation? The Current Debate&quot;, and of a 2010 book, &quot;All Shall Be Well&quot;, which reviews the doctrine of universal salvation from Origen to Moltmann.

On May 17, 2007, the Christian Universalist Association was founded at the historic Universalist National Memorial Church in Washington, DC. That was a move to distinguish the modern Christian Universalist movement from Unitarian Universalism and to promote ecumenical unity among Christian believers in universal reconciliation.

In 2008, the Russian Orthodox scholar-bishop Hilarion Alfeyev of Volokolamsk, in his presentation at the First World Apostolic Congress of Divine Mercy (held in Rome in 2008), argued that God&#x27;s mercy is so great that He does not condemn sinners to everlasting punishment. He said that the Orthodox understanding of Hell corresponds roughly to the Roman Catholic notion of purgatory. American Eastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart has also argued for the coherence of the universalist position, most notably in &quot;That All Shall Be Saved: Heaven, Hell, and Universal Salvation&quot; (2019).

In her massive 2013 monograph &quot;The Christian Doctrine of Apokatastasis, A Critical Assessment from the New Testament to Eriugena&quot;, Ilaria L.E. Ramelli argues that apokatastasis (restoration) is a major patristic doctrine stemming from Greek philosophy and Jewish-Christian Scriptures. She makes the case for its presence and Christological and Biblical foundation in many Fathers, analysing its meaning and development from the birth of Christianity to Eriugena.

Contemporary Conservative Evangelical teachers of ultimate reconciliation include Thomas Talbott and J.D. Leavitt, founder of Heavenly Faith.

Two Christian theologians of the 20th and 21st centuries who wrote in support of universalism and have received major notice are J.A.T. Robinson and John Hick. Both argued for universalism as coming from God&#x27;s nature as being of omnipotent love and stated that as time went on after death, some would temporarily refuse to repent, but none would refuse to repent forever. Hick, in particular, stated that the seemingly contradictory nature of the Bible&#x27;s references to damnation came about because the warnings of hell are conditional to warn men about eternal suffering if they permanently refuse to repent, but nobody would actually make that choice.

A proponent of the idea of universal salvation is also the Polish Cardinal Grzegorz Ryś, who in an interview on September 26, 2024, claimed that &quot;[...] all people, regardless of which religion they profess, OR WHETHER THEY PROFESS NONE AT ALL, are saved through the death, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus&quot;.

<text>Morley is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side, to the east of the Mare Fecunditatis. It was formerly a satellite crater of Maclaurin, being designated Maclaurin R, before being given its current name by the IAU in 1979. Morley lies to the west-southwest of Maclaurin.

This is a small, bowl-shaped crater that is similar to many comparable formations across the lunar surface. The inner walls are symmetrical in appearance and not notably eroded. They slope down to the interior floor, which has a diameter about half that of the entire crater.

<doc id="1290366" wikidata="Q469870" url="?curid=1290366" title="Amir Khan (boxer)">
<text>Amir Iqbal Khan (born 8 December 1986) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 2005 to 2022. Born and raised in Bolton, Khan began to box competitively at the age of 11. He rose to fame during the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he won a silver medal in the lightweight division and became at the age of 17, Britain&#x27;s youngest boxing Olympic medalist. He turned professional in 2005. In 2007, he was named ESPN prospect of the year. He later became one of the youngest ever British professional world champions, winning the World Boxing Association (WBA) title at the age of 22. 

Khan won the Commonwealth lightweight title in 2007. A year later, he won the WBO Inter-Continental lightweight title when he beat Martin Kristjansen via TKO. Later that year, he would lose the title to Breidis Prescott via KO, in one of the biggest upsets in British boxing history. His next three fights saw him win the vacant WBA International lightweight title, the vacant WBO Inter-Continental lightweight title, and the WBA light-welterweight title. He made his US debut against Paulie Malignaggi in May 2010, where he retained his WBA light-welterweight title. In 2011, he won the IBF light-welterweight title when he beat Zab Judah via KO in the fifth round. In July 2012, he lost the WBA (Super) light welterweight title against Danny Garcia. Later that year, he won the vacant WBC Silver interim light-welterweight title when he beat Carlos Molina via RTD. In 2014, he beat Luis Collazo for the WBA International and vacant WBC Silver welterweight titles. Between 2016 and 2019, Khan challenged for the WBC, &quot;The Ring&quot; middleweight titles and the WBO welterweight title. In July 2019, he won the vacant WBC International welterweight title when he beat Billy Dib via TKO in the fourth round.

Known for his hand speed and accuracy, Khan is regarded as one of the most successful British boxers of all time. He is credited with popularising boxing amongst British Pakistanis and British Asians, as well as inspiring South Asian involvement in all aspects of British boxing. Outside of boxing, he is a philanthropist with his own charity organisation, Amir Khan Foundation. He is also a promoter and sponsor, the owner of Khan Promotions and Pakistan&#x27;s Amir Khan Academy, and a co-owner of India&#x27;s Super Fight League (MMA) and Super Boxing League. As a celebrity, he has participated in several reality television and game shows. In 2017, he appeared on the seventeenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

==Early life==
Khan was born and raised in Bolton, Greater Manchester, to a Pakistani Punjabi Rajput family with roots in Matore village of Kahuta Tehsil, located in Rawalpindi District of Punjab, Pakistan. He was educated at Smithills School in Bolton, and Bolton Community College. Khan is a Muslim, and a member of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order, along with being an active supporter of the Muslim Writers Awards.

Khan has two sisters and one brother, Haroon &quot;Harry&quot; Khan, also a professional boxer. He is the first cousin of English cricketer Sajid Mahmood, related through a paternal grandfather, Lal Khan Janjua, who moved to England after being discharged from the Pakistan Army.

==Amateur boxing career==
Khan began to box competitively at the age of 11, with early honours including three English school titles, three junior ABA titles, and gold at the 2003 Junior Olympics. In early 2004 he won a gold medal at the European Student Championships in Lithuania, and in South Korea several months later he won a world junior lightweight title after fighting five times in seven days. One of his notable early amateur fights was against Victor Ortíz, whom he defeated in a second round stoppage. Overall, he compiled an amateur record of 101–9.

===2004 Olympics===
Khan qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics by finishing in first place at the 1st AIBA European 2004 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. He was Britain&#x27;s sole representative in boxing at the Athens Games, winning a silver medal at the age of 17 in the lightweight boxing category. He was Britain&#x27;s youngest Olympic boxer since Colin Jones in 1976. He lost in the final to Mario Kindelán, the Cuban who had also beaten him several months earlier in the pre-Olympic match-ups in Greece. In 2005, he avenged the two losses by beating the 34-year-old Kindelan in his last amateur fight.

His Olympic fights drew an audience of nearly 8million viewers on BBC, including 8million viewers watching his final Olympic match with Kindelan. His 2005 rematch with Kindelan drew an audience of 6.3million viewers on ITV.

* 2003 – Won a gold medal at the AAU Junior Olympic Games.

==Professional boxing career==

===Lightweight===
====Early career====
He made his professional debut against David Bailey in July 2005. The fight drew an audience of 4.4million viewers, which was ITV&#x27;s best Saturday night viewing figures of the month. By 2006, his fights were averaging between 6million and 7million viewers on ITV.

Khan won his first regional title on 14 July 2007, beating Willie Limond at The O2 Arena to become Commonwealth lightweight champion. Khan was floored in the sixth round, but recovered to score a knock down in the following round. Limond was retired by his corner at the end of round eight due to a broken nose and suspected jaw damage.

On 2 February 2008, Khan was scheduled to fight Martin Kristjansen, but illness forced the Dane to withdraw. Instead, Khan had to defend his Commonwealth title against late replacement Gairy St. Clair at the ExCel Arena, London. It was his first fight to last all twelve rounds and he won via a unanimous decision, with shutout scores of 120–108 from all three judges.

On 5 April 2008, Khan beat Kristjansen, dropping him three times in the seventh round to force a technical knockout (TKO) stoppage. Following the victory, Khan was made number one contender for the WBO lightweight title.

Following the fight, Khan split from his trainer Oliver Harrison, the trainer for all of his previous 17 professional contests. The break-up was blamed on Harrison&#x27;s concerns that Khan&#x27;s public engagements were interfering with his fight preparations. Dean Powell, who has trained former world champions Duke McKenzie and Lloyd Honeyghan, worked with Khan until a decision on a permanent trainer was made. In the same month, Khan had a training session in Las Vegas with Roger Mayweather, trainer and uncle of Floyd Mayweather Jr.

Khan fought on 21 June 2008, at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham against Irishman Michael Gomez, a former WBU super-featherweight champion. Khan knocked Gomez down twice in the fight, once in the opening round, and once in the fifth before the referee waved the fight off, giving Khan the victory via TKO. Still, Khan himself was hurt at various times during the fight, and was himself dropped in the second round. Despite Khan&#x27;s eagerness at a world title shot, his promoter, Frank Warren, insisted that &quot;He needs more schooling&quot;.

====Khan vs. Prescott, Fagan====
Following the Gomez fight, Jorge Rubio was installed as Khan&#x27;s new trainer. In early August, the lightweight Breidis Prescott was put forward by Rubio as Khan&#x27;s next opponent. Rubio had previously coached Richar Abril, who had recently lost a close decision to Prescott. Prescott had a prolific knock-out record of 17 KOs in 19 contests, yet Khan was a huge favourite.

The fight took place on 6 September 2008 at the Manchester Evening News Arena, it was Khan&#x27;s Sky Box Office debut. In the first round, Prescott came out fast and landed good shots; a stiff jab jerked Khan&#x27;s head back and foreshadowed what was to come. Prescott landed a left hook on Khan&#x27;s temple, dizzying his senses. Instead of holding, Khan tried to fire back, but was hit to the head by a left hook, right hook combination that sent him crashing to the canvas. Although Khan managed to return to his feet, Prescott forced the stoppage with another left that put Khan down again. The bout was officially called off at 55 seconds.
Following the defeat, Rubio was sacked and was replaced by Freddie Roach. Khan began training with Roach at the Wild Card Gym in Los Angeles, training alongside stablemate Manny Pacquiao, the then WBC lightweight champion and pound-for-pound king. On 6 December 2008, Khan scored a comeback win against Oisin Fagan with a second-round stoppage; Khan won the vacant WBA International lightweight title. Khan knocked Fagan down twice in the first round and Fagan&#x27;s corner threw in the towel after he was knocked down again in the second. Following the fight, it emerged that Fagan had suffered a fractured fibula during the first knockdown.

====Khan vs. Barrera====
In early 2009, it was announced that Khan would fight former seven-time and three-weight world champion Marco Antonio Barrera. Barrera was ranked No. 1 and Khan No. 5 in the WBO world lightweight rankings. Previous IBF, and WBO lightweight title holder Nate Campbell was stripped of the belts after moving up to the light-welterweight division and Khan&#x27;s promoter Frank Warren and Barrera&#x27;s promoter Don King lobbied the WBO to elevate the Khan-Barrera fight to a world lightweight title eliminator. However, the world-title status was instead given to the fight between Juan Manuel Márquez and Juan Diaz, ranked No. 2 and No. 3 respectively by the WBO.

On 14 March 2009, at the MEN Arena in Manchester, Khan defeated Barrera by technical decision (TD). The fight was stopped towards the end of the fifth round due to Barrera suffering a cut in the first round, which resulted from a clash of heads. With Barrera deemed in no position to fight on by the ringside doctor, the fight then went to the scorecards, on all three of which Khan was ahead (50–44, and 50–45 twice). With victory, Khan defended his WBA International lightweight title and also won the vacant WBO Inter-Continental lightweight title.

Frank Warren was sufficiently impressed with Khan&#x27;s performance to vow to land a world title fight for him before the end of the year. Khan also commented on the fight, saying: 

===Light welterweight===

====Khan vs. Kotelnik, Salita====
It was announced on 8 April 2009 that Khan would move up to the light-welterweight division to fight Andreas Kotelnik (31–2–1, 13 KOs) at the MEN Arena in Manchester for the WBA light-welterweight title on 18 July. Khan Said, &quot;This is the best news that I could have received. To fight for the world title in only my 22nd fight and at the age of just 22 is fantastic. Frank has done a great job getting the world title fight for me in Britain and now I have to go out win it.&quot; This would be Kotelnik&#x27;s fourth title defence. Khan won by unanimous decision (UD), 120–108, 118–111, 118–111, in front of 10,000, and became the third-youngest Brit to win a world title, at the age of 22. Khan used his hand speed and fitness to go well ahead on points in the first ten rounds. Kotelnik rallied in the closing rounds but could not land a decisive punch on Khan in spite of his best efforts. After the fight, Khan said, &quot;It&#x27;s the best feeling ever. I want to thank Freddie Roach and my team for making this happen. I&#x27;m a world champion and I&#x27;m going to enjoy it. I&#x27;m still young and I&#x27;ve got big things to come.&quot;

On 6 October 2009, Frank Warren confirmed that Khan would defend his WBA light-welterweight title against undefeated Dmitry Salita (30–0–1, 16 KOs), the mandatory challenger, on 5 December, at the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Due to Khan being a practising Muslim and Salita being an Orthodox Jew, the fight was hyped as a religious clash by the media, referring to it as a &quot;battle of faiths&quot; or &quot;holy war&quot;, though Khan and Salita both denied such claims. On 5 December 2009, Khan defeated Salita in 76 seconds, winning by TKO in the first round. Salita was knocked down three times, the first time just 10 seconds into the fight. It was the first loss of Salita&#x27;s career.

On 17 January 2010, Khan announced he had split with promoter Frank Warren and signed a deal with Oscar De La Hoya and Golden Boy Promotions, which resulted in Khan&#x27;s fights moving back to ITV.

====Khan vs. Malignaggi, Maidana====

On 9 March 2010, Golden Boy Promotions confirmed that Khan and former light-welterweight world champion Paulie Malignaggi would hold a press conference in London to announce their world title bout set for 15 May at The Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York. This was Khan&#x27;s first bout in the United States and the second defence of his WBA light-welterweight title. In front of a crowd of 4,412, in a one-sided fight, Khan retained his title after referee Steve Smoger halted the fight at 1 minute 25 seconds of round eleven. In the aftermath Malignaggi admitted he lost to the better man, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve fought two elite fighters, Miguel Cotto and Amir Khan. From here, I&#x27;m not sure where I go. I&#x27;ll sit down with my team. I don&#x27;t want to be a punching bag.&quot; Khan showed his speed, power and combinations throughout the fight and proved to be too much for Malignaggi.

Immediately after the fight, Khan stated he wanted to fight Marcos Maidana next, and that he would not be leaving the light-welterweight division until he had unified the various belts, suggesting that the way to do this would be for him to fight Maidana, and then go on to face the winner of a Devon Alexander vs. Timothy Bradley match.

Maidana (29–1, 27 KOs), after failing to challenge undefeated WBO light-welterweight champion Timothy Bradley, postponed the fight to 19 June due to a back injury. On 3 May, Maidana pulled out of the fight again, still citing his back as the problem. The fight had already been rescheduled from 19 June to 17 July, and Bradley went on to fight Luis Carlos Abregu on 17 July, instead of Maidana. After failing to secure the fight with Bradley, Maidana&#x27;s camp announced that he would fight former WBO light-welterweight champion DeMarcus Corley, on 28 August 2010 at the Luna Park Stadium in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Maidana went on to win by UD. Khan continued to look for a suitable opponent to challenge next for his title. One of his possible opponents was lightweight champion Juan Manuel Marquez. Marquez decided not to move up in weight and stayed at lightweight. Maidana then stated his intention to fight Khan: &quot;Stop looking for possible opponents for next Khan 11 December in England. Stop looking for lightweight boxers and face the real 140-pounders. I&#x27;ll go to Khan&#x27;s home soil to take the other portion of the WBA title that belongs to me.&quot; The fight was confirmed on 16 September to take place at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas on 11 December. Khan was reported to earn at least $1.5million compared to Maidana who had a purse of $550,000.

Khan successfully defended his title for the third time against Maidana. Khan knocked Maidana down with a combination of two body shots in the first round. Maidana was saved by the bell but regained composure and continued to battle on. Khan dominated the scoring until tiring around round seven. Maidana rallied and midway through round ten stunned Khan with a heavy right hand. Maidana followed up with a series of uppercuts and right hands. Khan then rallied to win rounds eleven and twelve to solidify a UD win. The scores were 114–111 twice, and 113–112. Khan was open to a rematch. Khan landed 273 of 603 punches thrown (45%) and Maidana landed 156 of 767 thrown (20%). The fight was awarded Fight of the Year by the Boxing Writers Association of America.

====Khan vs. McCloskey, Judah====
On 4 February 2011, Khan announced a deal had been signed to defend his WBA title against European champion Paul McCloskey in his next fight, who was unbeaten in 22 fights and was ranked world number 10. The fight was scheduled to take place at the MEN Arena on 6 April. Khan won a sixth-round TD after McCloskey was cut by an accidental clash of heads and could not go on in the estimation of the ring doctor. The heads of Khan and McCloskey collided about two minutes into the sixth round, causing a bad cut on the inside of McCloskey&#x27;s left eyebrow. Another tactical few rounds followed, with Khan the main aggressor. In the decisive sixth, a five-punch combination from Khan staggered McCloskey and moments later the pair went toe-to-toe before McCloskey reeled away and noticed blood coming from around his left eye. Khan had some trouble with the awkward and resilient southpaw, who was difficult to hit cleanly, but he was both too quick and too busy for McCloskey, winning all six rounds on all three cards. Frank Warren stated that the fight&#x27;s Primetime pay-per-view sold four times as many buys as the network&#x27;s previous record holder, Carl Froch vs. Mikkel Kessler, which sold 50,000 buys, thus the KhanMcCloskey fight sold about buys. The fight was shown in the US on HBO where it averaged 1.2million viewers.

On 31 May 2011, Khan agreed to fight 33-year-old two-weight champion Zab Judah (41–6, 28 KOs) in attempt to unify the WBA, and IBF light-welterweight titles in Las Vegas on 23 July. Judah had reclaimed the IBF title two months earlier against Kaizer Mabuza. Khan was unhappy that a fight with Bradley could not be made. He said, &quot;Bradley was the guy I wanted to fight but he chickened out. I offered him 50% of UK revenue, which is unheard of, and 50% of all revenue in America, that&#x27;s how much I wanted to fight him, but he didn&#x27;t want it.&quot; The fight was broadcast on Primetime in UK and HBO in the US. Round one saw a busy Khan as he fought from the outside and kept Judah away with jabs and straights. All four rounds were taken by Khan. Ultimately in the fifth round Judah was taken down with a right uppercut to the body, in which at first commentators believed it was a low blow, since Judah was showing signs of agonising pain, but when it was seen from a different camera angle, it was right on the belt, leading to an 18th knockout (KO) for Khan in his career so far. Khan later rejected claims for the low blow saying, &quot;He went down. It was above the belt. Zab&#x27;s a great fighter. I respect him a lot. But it was nowhere near below [the belt]. It was a great shot.&quot; Over five rounds, Khan landed 61 of 284 total punches (21%) and Judah landed 20 of 115 (17%). For the fight, Khan earned $1,072,500 and Judah had a $500,000 purse. The fight averaged 1.4million viewers on HBO, peaking at 1.417million viewers.

====Khan vs. Peterson====

Following the Judah victory, Khan began chasing a big money fight with top pound for pound fighter Floyd Mayweather Jr. Mayweather seemed uninterested, and instead said that Khan should fight the Mayweather Promotions prospect Jessie Vargas, an option that Khan dismissed. In October 2011, it was announced that Khan would defend his WBA and IBF light-welterweight against mandatory challenger Lamont Peterson (29–1–1, 15 KOs). The fight would take place on 10 December in Peterson&#x27;s home town of Washington, D.C. at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.

In front of a near sell out crowd of 8,647, Peterson defeated Khan by split decision (SD) in controversial fashion. Khan was docked a point in rounds seven and twelve by referee Joe Cooper for pushing, although illegal pushing is not usually met with such harsh consequences. Peterson was dropped to the canvas twice, although the first time was counted as a slip instead of a legitimate knockdown. Both fighters boxed well and two judges scored it 113–112 to Peterson, with the other 115–110 to Khan.

ESPN&#x27;s Dan Rafael scored the fight 114–111 in favour of Khan. HBO&#x27;s unofficial scorer, Harold Lederman, scored it 113–112, also for Khan. Deadspin described it as a robbery. After the fight, Khan said, &quot;It was like I was against two people, the referee and Lamont himself. I was the cleaner fighter; he was so wild. The referee wasn&#x27;t giving me a chance. I heard the referee give me a warning [for pushing], but there was nothing I could do. He kept coming in with his head. There hasn&#x27;t been [HBO] boxing in D.C. for the last [18] years because this is what happens.&quot; Khan earned a base purse of $1.1million, while Peterson earned a career-high $650,000 purse.

Khan appealed the decision to the sanctioning bodies, citing the poor refereeing, and the presence of a &quot;mystery man&quot; at ringside who could have interfered with the scoring. As soon as the WBA agreed and ordered an immediate rematch, Khan withdrew his appeal with the IBF.

A rematch was due to take place in May, but in the run up to the fight, Peterson tested positive for synthetic testosterone. The Nevada Athletic Commission denied Peterson a licence to box, and the fight was cancelled. The WBA reinstated Khan as champion, the IBF did not.

==== Khan vs. García ====
On 23 May 2012, ESPN announced that Khan would next fight against undefeated WBC champion Danny García. In the run up to the fight, García&#x27;s father and trainer, Angel García, made disparaging comments about Khan&#x27;s race and religion.

Khan entered the fight as heavy favourite and through the first two rounds and most of the third, he heavily outlanded García. The tide turned late in the third round as García was able to land a hard left hook counterpunch off a missed right. Khan hit the canvas and was clearly hurt, on unsteady legs, for the remaining seconds of the round. García kept pressing in round four, forcing Khan to take a second eight count after he touched the canvas with his glove. Khan regrouped and was temporarily able to go back at García, but with less than a minute left in the round Khan was dropped a third time. Referee Kenny Bayless stopped the fight despite Khan assuring him he could continue. After the fight, Khan said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my night. I was coming in with my hands down and Danny took advantage of that. He countered very well against me.&quot; Khan&#x27;s trainer Roach credited his opposite number, Angel García, for successfully goading Khan into fighting a slugfest, leaving himself vulnerable.

According to CompuBox, Khan landed 92 of 206 punches thrown (45%), with 46 jabs and 46 power shots landed. García landed 65 of his 216 thrown (30%), 60 of which were power shots. Khan earned $950,000, while García had a $520,000 purse. Nevada State Athletic Commission announced the fight generated a total gate of $426,152 from 3,147 tickets sold. The fight averaged 1.3million viewers on HBO World Championship Boxing.

====Khan vs. Molina====
Khan split with trainer Freddie Roach following the García defeat and started training under Virgil Hunter. It was hoped that the new coach could improve Khan&#x27;s defensive skills. Khan&#x27;s next fight was against undefeated lightweight prospect Carlos Molina (17–0–1, 7 KOs). Molina would be moving up in weight for his first twelve-round fight. The fight was aired on Showtime, on 15 December 2012, and took place in the LA Sports Arena in California.

Khan defeated Molina by TKO in the tenth round and won the WBC Silver light-welterweight title. Khan pushed Molina onto the back foot and landed a sharp right hand that cut Molina over the left eye. Khan was stiffened by a right hook in the second before steadying the ship and resuming control of the contest. With Molina&#x27;s cut deteriorating badly and taking plenty of punishment, referee Jack Reiss suggested his corner pull him out at the end of the ninth, however Molina was sent out for more, despite it being abundantly clear that he did not have the ability to do Khan much damage. Khan started to let his hands go more in round ten, after which his corner finally decided it had seen enough. Khan landed 312 of 679 punches thrown (46%), an equal amount of jabs and power shots were landed. Molina was less busy, landing 87 of 335 (26%). The fight averaged 616,000 viewers.

===Welterweight===

====Khan vs. Diaz, Collazo====
Following his victory over Molina, Khan returned to the UK for a fight against 33 year old Julio Díaz (40–7–1, 29 KOs) on 27 April 2013 in a 143 lbs catch-weight bout. The fight took place at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield. Khan was able to control some of the fight and managed to survive a fourth-round knockdown from Díaz. Khan managed to hold on throughout the fight to go onto win by UD. The scorecards read 115–113, 115–112, and 114–113. In the aftermath, Khan praised Díaz, &quot;He caught me while I was off balance, and I couldn&#x27;t get my stance back. I went down. I kept moving to recompose myself. That&#x27;s what happens. There are little things to work on when we go back in the gym.&quot; Khan stated the fight could be his last in the UK.

Despite interest in a bout with Khan, Floyd Mayweather announced that he would fight Marcos Maidana (35–3, 31 KOs) on 3 May 2014. On 24 March, Khan decided to fight 32-year-old former champion Luis Collazo (35–5, 18 KOs) on the undercard at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. The fight was for the vacant WBA International welterweight title and WBA title eliminator, as well as the vacant WBC Silver title. Khan was too fast and too disciplined for Collazo, flooring him in the fourth round and twice in the tenth. The judges scored the fight 119–104, and 117–106 twice in Khan&#x27;s favour. Khan and Collazo both incurred point deductions in round eight. Collazo hit Khan with a low blow while Khan was holding his head down. Collazo&#x27;s failed approach resulted in a mismatch on the scorecards. Collazo fought with his hands down most of the night, unafraid of Khan, believing Khan had no power and he would eventually knock him out. In the post-fight interview in the ring, Khan credited his twelve months of boxing training with Virgil Hunter for his success. Khan&#x27;s purse for the fight was $1.5m while Collazo earned $350,000.

====Khan vs. Alexander====

Khan looked to fight one more time in 2014, targeting Devon Alexander or Robert Guerrero. On 21 October, it was announced that Khan would fight former two-weight world champion Alexander (26–2, 14 KOs). The fight took place on 13 December at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Showtime in the US and Sky Sports in the UK.

In front of 7,768 in attendance, Khan produced a dominant performance to secure a unanimous points victory over Alexander. All three judges scored heavily in Khan&#x27;s favour, 120–108, 119–109 and 118–110. ESPN&#x27;s Dan Rafael scored it a 120–108 shutout for Khan. Alexander followed Khan around the ring throughout but was unable to land more than one punch at a time as Khan met him in his tracks with hard combinations. After his victory Khan reiterated his desire to fight Floyd Mayweather. Promoter Oscar De La Hoya said, &quot;So now I know why Mayweather doesn&#x27;t want to fight him. He was brilliant. I wouldn&#x27;t have fought him. He is hitting his peak just now. He looked incredible.&quot; Khan outlanded Alexander 243 to 91, according to CompuBox, and connected on 43% of his shots, compared to just 20% for Alexander. Khan earned $950,000 and Alexander was paid $600,000 for the fight. The fight averaged 762,000 and peaked 887,000 viewers.

==== Khan vs. Algieri ====
After Khan himself initially announced the fight on his wife&#x27;s YouTube channel on 3 April, a welterweight bout against former WBO light-welterweight champion Chris Algieri (20–1, 8 KOs) was later finalised to take to place on 29 May 2015, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Khan won the bout by UD, winning on all three judges scorecards (117–111 twice and 115–113). Khan counterpunched effectively from the outside after being surprised with Algieri&#x27;s aggression. Algieri fought a far better fight than he did against Manny Pacquiao, throwing more punches and landing some power shots. Khan landed 218 of 609 punches thrown (36%), while Algieri landed on 199 of 703 (28%), most of which were in the opening six rounds. Following the victory, Khan was now 5–0 against New York opponents. He again called out Mayweather saying, &quot;I think everybody knows Amir Khan wants to fight Floyd Mayweather. Mayweather is a champion, so let&#x27;s make it happen.&quot; Khan made $1.5million and Algieri earned a $500,000 purse. The fight, which took place on Spike, averaged 1million viewers and peaked at 1.2million.

===Middleweight===

====Khan vs. Álvarez====

In early 2016, it was announced that Khan is moving up two weight divisions to middleweight, to fight Canelo Álvarez (46–1–1, 32 KOs) WBC, &quot;The Ring&quot;, and lineal middleweight titles. The fight took place on 7 May 2016, at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bout was on HBO PPV.

Khan lost to Álvarez by way of knockout in round six. Although many believe Khan was ahead on points including ESPN, two of the ringside judges had Álvarez ahead after five rounds (49–46 and 48–47), the third judge had Khan ahead (48–47). With the scorecards heading towards a SD halfway through the fight, Khan admitted, &quot;it may have been a blessing being knocked out in the sixth round, rather than an upset loss on the scorecards after twelve rounds. According to CompuBox, Álvarez landed 64 of 170 (38%) and Khan landed 48 of 166 punches (29%).

Alvarez&#x27; official purse for the bout was $3.5 million and Khan had a base purse of $2 million. With the event hitting at least 500,000 buys, Alvarez would see his earning reach up to $20 million and Khan&#x27;s earnings around $13 million, plus his BoxNation TV deal.

The fight generated a live gate of $7,417,350, according to figures released by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. That total came from 13,072 tickets sold, far short of a sellout. The Álvarez-Khan gross placed it 34th-best in Nevada history. On PPV, the fight sold around 600,000 PPV buys and grossed more than $30million. This made it one of the biggest recent PPV fights, behind Miguel Cotto vs. Canelo Álvarez, and surpassing Manny Pacquiao vs. Timothy Bradley III and Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Andre Berto.

=== Return to welterweight ===
On 26 February 2017, Khan and reigning WBO welterweight champion Manny Pacquiao both tweeted a deal had been reached between both camps for a &#x27;super fight&#x27; worth potentially £30million to take place on 23 April in the United Arab Emirates. Pacquiao was initially in negotiations to fight Jeff Horn in Australia, but held a poll asking the fans who he should fight next. Khan won the poll, thus setting up the fight. The Sevens Stadium in Dubai, Zayed Sports City Stadium and Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi were being considered as venues. Speaking to Bob Arum on 1 March, Pacquiao&#x27;s adviser Michael Koncz confirmed the fight would place on 20 May in the United Arab Emirates. Only a week later, Bob Arum told ESPN that, &quot;It&#x27;s kaddish for the UAE deal. It&#x27;s dead.&quot; Arum also said that Khan would not be Pacquiao&#x27;s next opponent.

==== Khan vs. Lo Greco ====
On 10 January 2018, during a live press conference in London, Khan signed a three-fight deal with Eddie Hearn at Matchroom Sport. The deal meant Khan would fight exclusively on Sky Sports, with his return bout in the UK taking place on 21 April at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. on 29 January, Phil Lo Greco (28–3, 17 KOs) was announced as his opponent. At the official press conference, a brawl broke out after Lo Greco made comments about Khan&#x27;s personal life, &quot;After the Canelo loss you went on a losing streak – family, wife and then you go out and tweet to the heavyweight champion of the world. What is wrong with you, mate?&quot; Khan responded by throwing his glass full of water towards Lo Greco. The bout was fought at a catchweight of 150pounds, as requested by Lo Greco&#x27;s team. Khan trained with Joe Goosen for the fight, with Virgil Hunter unavailable due to ill health. The fight would be the first boxing main event to stream on ESPN&#x27;s new streaming service ESPN+.

Khan knocked Lo Greco out in 39 seconds of round one, setting a new record for himself. The first knockdown occurred after just 15 seconds when Khan landed a right hand to the head. Lo Greco appeared hurt, but managed to beat the 10 count. When the action resumed, Khan quickly moved on Lo Greco, putting him against the ropes with a flurry of punches until he dropped once more. Referee Victor Loughlin called a halt to the fight immediately. After the fight, rival Kell Brook, who was on pundit duty, entered the ring and the two boxers traded words. Khan said, &quot;The weight is an issue with Kell, I&#x27;m a 147 lbs fighter. I will fight and beat Kell Brook and the world knows it.&quot; During the post-fight press conference, Khan named a number of top welterweights including Keith Thurman and Errol Spence, but stated he would like to bring Adrien Broner over to the UK for a big fight.

==== Khan vs. Vargas ====
At an official press conference on 28 June, it was announced that Khan would return to Arena Birmingham for the first time since 2008, against Colombian Samuel Vargas (29–3–2, 14 KOs), who has been a five-fight unbeaten run since November 2016. Speaking of the fight, Khan said, &quot;One of my aims this year was to be as active as possible, so I&#x27;m very happy to get back in the ring again so soon against Samuel Vargas. Vargas is a tough and well-schooled fighter, who has shared the ring with some top welterweights including Danny Garcia and Errol Spence Jr.&quot; Vargas weighed 146 lbs. At first attempt Khan weighed 147.2 lbs. He then took off his socks and weighed 147.1 lbs. Khan then took off his shorts, stripping completely naked and made the 147 lbs limit.

The fight took place on 8 September 2018, Khan won the fight by UD, with scores of 119–108, 119–109 and 118–110. Khan knocked Vargas twice in the fight in dropping him in round two and three. Vargas dropped Khan once in round three. Khan fought well in round five in landing a lot of fast combinations to the head of Vargas, who suffered a nose injury. Vargas took the punishment and showed a lot of heart as he kept coming forward. Midway through the fight, Khan began to slow down and showed fatigue. He began to pick his combinations rather than just throw a flurry. Vargas focused mostly on the body attack for the fight. He managed to have Khan in trouble as he pinned him against the ropes, most notably in rounds six and ten. After the fight, Khan said, &quot;I really wanted to go the distance. It&#x27;s been three years since I went twelve rounds. There were a couple of times when I could have stopped him and I kind of stepped off him.&quot; Khan called for a fight against former sparring partner Manny Pacquiao and Eddie Hearn said it was &#x27;now or never&#x27; for a Kell Brook fight. According to CompuBox stats, Khan landed 199 punches of 581 thrown (35%) and Vargas was credited with landing 142 of his 535 thrown (27%). Vargas landed 100 shots to Khan&#x27;s body, 91 being power punches. Hearn announced that the fight set a viewership record, for the biggest live audience on UK subscription television in boxing history.

==== Khan vs. Crawford ====
On 9 December 2018, it was reported that Top Rank had offered Khan a guaranteed $5 million purse, plus a percentage of PPV revenue, to fight Terence Crawford on 23 March 2019 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The fight was made official in January 2019, and it was set to take place at Madison Square Garden on 20 April. The fight would be broadcast live on ESPN PPV; UK broadcasting rights were later acquired by BT Sport Box Office. Khan, commenting on facing Crawford rather than long-time domestic rival Brook, believed winning a world title against a consensus pound-for-pound boxer would be a bigger achievement than defeating Brook. He also believed that win or lose against Crawford, the Brook opportunity would still be available. Khan returned to veteran trainer Virgil Hunter for the Crawford bout. Hunter was unable to train Khan for his previous two bouts due to ill health.

Khan was comprehensively outboxed by Crawford, and was knocked down in the first round. In round six, Khan was hit by an accidental low blow, and during the allocated five-minute recovery time, trainer Virgil Hunter threw in the towel to hand Crawford a TKO victory. At the time of the stoppage, Crawford lead on all three scorecards, 50–44, and 49–45 twice. Following the fight, Khan had to respond to criticism that he quit in the ring.

==== Khan vs. Dib ====
On 12 July 2019 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Khan defeated former IBF featherweight champion Billy Dib by technical knockout in the fourth round to win the vacant WBC International welterweight title. Dib took the fight on short notice in June after Khan&#x27;s original opponent Neeraj Goyat was injured in a car crash. On the night, Khan sent Dib to the canvas in the second round with a left hook. In the fourth round, a double left hook followed by a rapid combination knocked Dib down again, prompting his corner to throw in the towel.

The programme centred around troubled angry men and aimed to use the disciplines of boxing, coupled with faith and family values, to help re-focus their lives and steer them away from trouble in the future. It was screened in August/September 2007.

On 29 March 2021, Khan appeared in an eight-part reality show on BBC Three called &quot;Meet the Khans: Big in Bolton&quot;, alongside his wife Faryal.

Khan has his own brand of soft drinks in Pakistan.

===Game shows===
As a celebrity, he has participated in several game shows. These include &quot;Countdown&quot;, &quot;Beat the Star&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

====&quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;====
On 12 November 2017, Khan arrived in Brisbane, Australia to appear as a contestant on the seventeenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. Khan was the highest-paid contestant in the history of the show, beating the previous record held by Katie Price. On 8 December 2017, Khan was the seventh person to be eliminated from the show, coming in 5th place overall. The episode which featured Khan&#x27;s elimination aired in the UK on his 31st birthday. Khan donated part of his earnings to Barnado&#x27;s, for whom he is an ambassador.

The show&#x27;s ratings averaged between 8million and 10million viewers every day for two weeks in the United Kingdom. The show peaked at 12.69million viewers for the first episode, while the final episode drew 10.68million viewers.

In 2023, he appeared in a spin-off &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... South Africa&quot;.

===Motoring offences and incidents===
On 23 October 2007, Khan was convicted of careless driving at Bolton Crown Court and given a six-month driving ban and a £1000 fine. The conviction related to an incident that occurred on 2 March 2006 in the centre of Bolton, when Khan&#x27;s car hit and broke the leg of a pedestrian who was using a pelican crossing while Khan was travelling at 47 mph in a 30 mph zone and overtaking in the wrong lane. He was cleared of dangerous driving but charged with the lesser offence of careless driving.

Khan was also summoned to appear in court in Rochdale on 26 October 2007, accused of travelling in excess of 140 mph on the M62 motorway on 31 December 2006. He failed to appear and the case was adjourned to 2 November 2007, with the District Judge warning that he would issue an arrest warrant if the accused did not appear by then. He was also charged with not producing his driving licence and insurance certificate. On 7 January 2008, Khan was fined £1000 and banned for 42 days for the speeding offence.

==Awards and honours==
Khan was a 2005 nominee for the Laureus World Sports Awards for Breakthrough of the Year.

In 2007, he was named ESPN prospect of the year. His defeat of Marcos Maidana in 2010 was awarded Fight of the Year by the Boxing Writers Association of America. He was a nominee for the 2011 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award after defeating Zab Judah.

In January 2013, he was nominated for the Best at Sport award at the British Muslim Awards. In 2014, he was given Pride of Performance from the President of Pakistan.

In May 2024, he was given an honorary rank of Captain by the Pakistan Army. In a video shared on his Instagram account, Khan thanked the army for the honour.

<doc id="1290368" wikidata="Q7858310" url="?curid=1290368" title="Twin Tower">
<text>Twin Tower () is a 1970s Hong Kong public housing residential block design. In plan, the blocks look like two hollow squares joined at one corner of each square. Each block comprises two &quot;towers&quot; of different heights, although their shapes are the same. The high tower ranges from 24 to 28 stories while the low tower is 21 stories. The size of a typical flat is 36 to 46 m2. It cannot support more than 5 people in a typical flat.

The units in Twin Tower blocks are self-contained flats, each with a kitchen, toilet, and balcony.

The first Twin Tower blocks appeared at Wah Fu Estate. They were suited to the steeply sloping site, as one of the two &quot;towers&quot; within each block is offset by three storeys from the other, providing ground level entrances at multiple points along the slope. The two central atria in each block measure 50 by 50 feet. Reportedly, the square shape of the twin tower design provided the structural stability necessary to build more floors than the earlier, narrower slab blocks.

The Twin Tower blocks at Wah Fu make use of load-bearing partition walls which make construction faster through standardisation, obviate the need for interior columns within flats, and improve structural wind resistance.

After their introduction at Wah Fu Estate, the Twin Tower design appeared at Oi Man Estate and then many other public estates across Hong Kong in the 1970s.

<text>The National Conference League (NCL) comprises the five levels of the British rugby league system at the top end of the amateur pyramid below the professional League One. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Rugby Football League (RFL). The NCL has promotion and relegation between the Premier Division and Division Three; there is no promotion or relegation between the Conference League South, regional leagues or promotion to League One without an application to the RFL.

==System==
The NCL consists of five divisions. Teams can be promoted and relegated through the top four divisions (Premier, One, Two and Three). There is no promotion and relegation between Division Three and the Southern Conference League or the regional leagues. Clubs outside the NCL can apply to join Division Three.

Although the NCL sits below League One, teams are not promoted and relegated between the amateur leagues and the professional game, although any club from NCL to the regional leagues can apply to join League One.

In each division clubs play each other twice, once at their home stadium and once at their opponents. Teams receive two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. Teams are ranked by competition points, points difference (points scored less points conceded), and points scored.

At the end of the season in the Premier Division, the top six teams enter the play-offs with the winner being crowned NCL champions. The bottom three clubs are relegated to Division One.

For Divisions One, Two and Three, the top two clubs are promoted from their respective divisions while teams finishing between 3rd and 6th play-off for the final promotion place. With the exception of Division Three, the bottom three clubs are relegated.

For the Southern Conference League, clubs play each other once home and away. At the end of the season, the top four teams play-off to determine the champions. No club is promoted or relegated.

==History==
In the early days, rugby league had an established structure outside of the professional leagues with county-wide competitions. This decayed into local district leagues usually only featuring teams from one or two towns with no input from the professional game. This eventually saw the number of amateur rugby league clubs reduce to 150 in the early 1970s.

Against this background, the British Amateur Rugby League Association was formed in 1973. One of its first acts was to merge most of the district leagues into three regional leagues: the Yorkshire League, the Pennine League and the North Western Counties League. For geographical reasons, the Hull League, the Cumberland League, the Barrow League and the London League were left as they were.

This allowed clubs to play at more appropriate standards as there were more divisions, and this factor - along with the improved governance of BARLA - saw the standard and numbers of clubs rise quickly. However, while there was a National Cup, the best amateur clubs were still divided between six leagues and thus the desire for an amateur National League arose.

The BARLA National League was formed in 1986. It received 27 applications including five from the Barrow area, and more unusually, one from a London club, South London Warriors.

In the end the league settled on 10 members, all from the northern strongholds of the game. These were four clubs from Yorkshire: Dudley Hill, Milford Marlins, Heworth and West Hull; four clubs from Lancashire: Pilkington Recs, Wigan St Patrick&#x27;s, Woolston Rovers and Leigh Miners&#x27; Welfare; and two clubs from Cumbria: Egremont Rangers and Millom. These ten clubs were to be the members for each of the first three seasons.

The National League soon proved popular. For the 1989/90 season, the top flight was extended to 12 teams to include Lock Lane and Mayfield. However, this modest expansion wasn&#x27;t enough and the 1989/90 season also saw the addition of a 10-team second division (to expand to 12 teams after one season).

The ten inaugural members of the second division were: Saddleworth Rangers, Leigh East, British Aerospace, Barrow Island, Askam, Knottingley, Redhill, Dewsbury Celtic, Shaw Cross Sharks and East Leeds. This expansion proved successful with Leigh East becoming the first non-founder members to win the league, in the 1990/91 season.

In 1993, the RFL wanted to contract the professional ranks from 35 to 32 teams. However, their initial plan to place the excluded teams in the Alliance (reserve grade) faced a legal challenge so they needed an alternative competition for them. The RFL thus proposed a league to bridge the gap between the professional and amateur leagues to feature the three demoted semi-pro clubs plus Hemel Hempstead (who already played in the Alliance as a semi-pro club) and eight BARLA clubs.

However, BARLA wanted all National League clubs to be in any such league and since the RFL were in a tough legal position they were prepared to compromise with BARLA and thus the three division NCL was born. Other concessions included an increase in the BARLA representation in the Challenge Cup from two clubs to 64 and allowing the NCL champions to apply to replace the bottom team in the pro leagues.

The latter concession soon disappeared as the pro leagues moved to summer and the National Conference League did not want to move. Also, Woolston Rovers&#x27; application to replace Highfield was voted out (the one club elected to the league from the NCL being Chorley Borough who were themselves a former semi-pro league club). The NCL soon expanded all divisions to 14 teams, though on occasions it has struggled to reach full complement of members, and lost all the remaining semi-pro clubs within three seasons.

After the switch of the pro game to summer, the NCL became solely a BARLA league, despite being temporarily expelled from BARLA in 2002. Initially, only three NCL teams joined National League Three (intended to bridge the gap between the pro and amateur games) but this changed in 2008 when the NCL downgraded the league&#x27;s BARLA membership from full to associate. In 2009 the NCL introduced a summer competition for clubs wanting to play year round as a test for a more permanent switch to summer which came in 2012.

From 2012 the Conference played in summer, as tier 3 of the new pyramid, and the initial season saw two former Rugby League Conference National Division clubs admitted (Dewsbury Celtic and Featherstone Lions) with others expected to join from 2013. For one season only the Rugby League Conference National Division ran as Conference division three with no automatic promotion to division two, but after this, all northern clubs were required to meet full Conference criteria to play in tier 3. The RFL also had ambitions of a Conference South which would leave the former NCL as Conference North. From 2013, the limit on member clubs was raised from 42 to 56 and saw an increase to four divisions.

<text>Celtic rock is a genre of folk rock, as well as a form of Celtic fusion which incorporates Celtic music, instrumentation and themes into a rock music context. It has been prolific since the early 1970s and can be seen as a key foundation of the development of successful mainstream Celtic bands and popular musical performers, as well as creating important derivatives through further fusions. It has played a major role in the maintenance and definition of regional and national identities and in fostering a pan-Celtic culture. It has also helped to communicate those cultures to external audiences.

==Definition==
The style of music is the hybrid of traditional Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Breton musical forms with rock music. This has been achieved by the playing of traditional music, particularly ballads, jigs and reels with rock instrumentation; by the addition of traditional Celtic instruments, including the Celtic harp, tin whistle, uilleann pipes (or Irish Bagpipes), fiddle, bodhrán, accordion, concertina, melodeon, and bagpipes (highland) to conventional rock formats; by the use of lyrics in Celtic languages and by the use of traditional rhythms and cadences in otherwise conventional rock music. Just as the validity of the term Celtic in general and as a musical label is disputed, the term Celtic rock cannot be taken to mean there was a unified Celtic musical culture between the Celtic nations. However, the term has remained useful as a means of describing the spread, adaptation and further development of the musical form in different but related contexts.

==History==

===Ireland===
It was in Ireland that Celtic rock was first clearly evident as musicians attempted to apply the use of traditional and electric music to their own cultural context. By the end of the 1960s Ireland already had perhaps the most flourishing folk music tradition and a growing blues and pop scene, which provided a basis for Irish rock. Perhaps the most successful product of this scene was the band Thin Lizzy. Formed in 1969 their first two albums were recognisably influenced by traditional Irish music and their first hit single &quot;Whisky in the Jar&quot; in 1972, was a rock version of a traditional Irish song. From this point they began to move towards the hard rock that allowed them to gain a series of hit singles and albums, but retained some occasional elements of Celtic rock on later albums such as &quot;Jailbreak&quot; (1976).

Formed in 1970, Horslips were the first Irish group to have the terms &#x27;Celtic rock&#x27; applied to them, and produced work that included traditional Irish/Celtic music and instrumentation, Celtic themes and imagery, and concept albums based on Irish mythology in a way that entered the territory of progressive rock all powered by a hard rock sound. Horslips are considered important in the history of Irish rock as they were the first major band to enjoy success without having to leave their native country and can be seen as providing a template for Celtic rock in Ireland and elsewhere. These developments ran in parallel with the burgeoning folk revival in Ireland that included groups such as Planxty and the Bothy Band. It was from this tradition that Clannad, whose first album was released in 1973, adopted electric instruments and a more &#x27;new age&#x27; sound at the beginning of the 1980s. Moving Hearts, formed in 1981 by former Planxty members Christy Moore and Donal Lunny, followed the pattern set by Horslips in combining Irish traditional music with rock, and also added elements of jazz to their sound.

===Scotland===
There were already strong links between Irish and Scottish music by the 1960s, with Irish bands like The Chieftains touring and outselling the native artists in Scotland. The adoption of folk rock produced groups including the JSD Band and Spencer&#x27;s Feat. Out of the wreckage of the latter in 1974, was formed probably the most successful band in this genre, combining Irish and Scottish personnel to form Five Hand Reel. Two of the most successful groups of the 1980s emerged from the dance band circuit in Scotland. From 1978, when they began to release original albums, Runrig produced highly polished Scottish folk rock, including the first commercially successful album with the all Gaelic &quot;Play Gaelic&quot; in 1978. From the 1980s Capercaillie combined Scottish folk music, electric instruments and haunting vocals to considerable success. Scottish Band The Waterboys became a well known Celtic Rock band during the 80s with the release of albums such as This Is The Sea and Fisherman&#x27;s Blues. They also incorporated folk elements into their music. One of Scotland&#x27;s most commercially successful and fondly-remembered rock acts, Big Country, also incorporated the influence of traditional Scottish music into their songs. While bagpipes had become an essential element in Scottish folk bands they were much rarer in folk rock outfits, but were successfully integrated into their sound by Wolfstone from 1989, who focused on a combination of highland music and rock.

===Brittany===
The region of Brittany also made a major contribution to Celtic rock. The Breton cultural revival of the 1960s was exemplified by Alan Stivell who became the leading proponent of the Breton harp and other instruments from about 1960, he then adopted elements of Irish, Welsh and Scottish traditional music in an attempt to create a pan-Celtic folk music, which had considerable impact elsewhere, particularly in Wales and Cornwall. From 1972 he began to play folk rock with a band including guitarists Dan Ar Braz and Gabriel Yacoub. Yacoub went on to form Malicorne in 1974 one of the most successful folk rock bands in France. After an extensive career that included a stint playing as part of Fairport Convention in 1976, Ar Braz formed the pan-Celtic band Heritage des Celtes, who managed to achieve mainstream success in France in the 1990s. Probably the best known and most enduring folk rock band in France were Tri Yann formed in 1971 and still recording and performing today.

===Wales===
While Welsh folk music developed as a distinctive part of a pan-Celtic movement, early Welsh pop and rock music was more influenced by American and English artists than Irish and Scottish acts. By the end of the 1960s the Welsh rock scene included a number of internationally successful English language groups that included Badfinger, Amen Corner, Elastic Band, Budgie and Man.

The Welsh rock scene would change markedly from October 1969, when the Sain record label released its first single. Founded as a label for both rock and folk musicians in the Welsh-language, and home to artists such as Dafydd Iwan, Meic Stevens and Ar Log, Sain would become Wales&#x27; biggest record label. With Sains success as both a folk and rock label, more and more folk musicians transitioned into rock music in the early 1970s, meaning that traditional Celtic element within Welsh folk music now became evident within the burgeoning Welsh language rock scene. Acts such as Edward H. Dafis caused a sensation by &quot;going electric&quot; and using rock instrumentation. This new Welsh language rock scene was also associated with Welsh nationalism, political activism and the campaign for the Welsh language. 
by the 1980s Celtic rock had firmly transitioned into the mainstream, and was now at the centre of Welsh language culture. With acts such as Ar Log touring the world with new renditions of &quot;traditional Welsh folk music, haunting love songs, harp airs, melodic dance tunes and rousing sea shanties&quot;. Dafydd Iwan&#x27;s 1983 song Yma o Hyd would become his biggest cross-over success.

The late 1970s and 1980s also saw a backlash against Celtic rock. With many Welsh language acts such as Sains own Geraint Jarman finding success using more contemporary and global musical forms (such as reggae) with lyrics conforming to the traditional techniques of Welsh formal poetry. Jarman would later be credited by the musician Gruff Rhys with &quot;severing ties with Celtic folk and serving as a bridge to a new wave of post punk&quot;. The Welsh scene became divided between more traditional music and the new punk-folk bands such as Bob Delyn a&#x27;r Ebillion. While the 1990s saw the creation of the Fflach:tradd label and an increase in recognisably Celtic rock acts such as The Bluehorses, the era is marked by the success of Wales&#x27; international Rock acts such as the Manic Street Preachers, Stereophonics, Super Furry Animals and Catatonia. However, current Welsh rock acts such as Calan and Bwncath continue to find success within the Celtic rock genre.

===Cornwall and the Isle of Man===
Whereas other Celtic nations already had existing folk music cultures before the end of the 1960s this was less true in Cornwall and the Isle of Man, which were also relatively small in population and more integrated into English culture and (in the case of Cornwall) the British State. As a result, there was relatively little impact from the initial wave of folk electrification in the 1970s. However, the pan-Celtic movement, with its musical and cultural festivals helped foster some reflections in Cornwall where a few bands from the 1980s onwards utilised the traditions of Cornish music with rock, including Moondragon and its successor Lordryk. More recently the bands Sacred Turf, Skwardya and Krena, have been performing in the Cornish language.

==Subgenres==

===Celtic punk===

Ireland proved particularly fertile ground for punk bands in the mid-1970s, including Stiff Little Fingers, The Undertones, The Radiators From Space, The Boomtown Rats and The Virgin Prunes. Scotland also produced its fair share with acts including The Skids and The Rezillos. As with folk rock in England, the advent of punk and other musical trends undermined the folk element of Celtic rock, but in the early 1980s London based Irish band The Pogues created the subgenre Celtic punk by combining structural elements of folk music with a punk attitude and delivery. The Pogues&#x27; style of punked-up Irish music spawned and influenced a number of Celtic punk bands, including fellow London-Irish band Neck, Nyah Fearties from Scotland, Australia&#x27;s Roaring Jack and Norway&#x27;s Greenland Whalefishers.

===Diaspora Celtic rock===

One by-product of the Celtic Diaspora was the existence of large communities across the world that looked for their cultural roots and identity to their origins in the Celtic nations. While it seems young musicians from these communities usually chose between their folk culture and mainstream forms of music such as rock or pop, after the advent of Celtic punk relatively large numbers of bands began to emerge styling themselves as Celtic rock. This is particularly noticeable in the US and Canada, where there are large communities descended from Irish and Scottish immigrants. From the United States this includes the Irish bands Flogging Molly, The Tossers, Dropkick Murphys, The Young Dubliners, LeperKhanz, Black 47, The Killdares, The Drovers and Jackdaw, and for Scottish bands Prydein, Seven Nations and Flatfoot 56. From Canada are bands like The Mahones, Enter the Haggis, Great Big Sea, The Real Mckenzies and Spirit of the West. These groups were naturally influenced by American forms of music, some containing members with no Celtic ancestry and commonly singing in English. A band in England is the BibleCode Sundays.

===Celtic metal===

Like Celtic rock in the 1970s, Celtic metal resulted from the application of a development in English music, when in the 1990s thrash metal band Skyclad added violins, and with them jigs and folk voicings, to their music on the album &quot;The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth&quot; (1990). This inspired the Dublin based band Cruachan to mix traditional Irish music with black metal and to create the subgenre of Celtic metal. They were soon followed by bands such as Primordial and Waylander. Like Celtic punk, Celtic metal replicates the fusing of Celtic folk tradition with contemporary forms of music. A well-known representative of this style is Thanateros from Germany.

==Influence==
Whereas in England folk rock, after initial mainstream recognition, subsided into the status of a sub-cultural soundtrack, in many Celtic communities and nations it has remained at the forefront of musical production. The initial wave of Celtic rock in Ireland, although ultimately feeding into Anglo-American dominated progressive rock and hard rock provided a basis for Irish bands that would enjoy international success, including the Pogues and U2: one making use of the tradition of Celtic music in a new context and the other eschewing it for a distinctive but mainstream sound. Similar circumstances can be seen in Scotland albeit with a delay in time while Celtic rock culture developed, before bands like Runrig could achieve international recognition. Widely acknowledged as one of the outstanding voices in Celtic/rock is Brian McCombe (born Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom) of The Brian McCombe Band, a pan Celtic group based in Brittany.

In other Celtic communities, and particularly where Celtic speakers or descendants are a minority, the function of Celtic rock has been less to create mainstream success, than to bolster cultural identity. A consequence of this has been the reinforcement of pan-Celtic culture and of particular national or regional identities between those with a shared heritage, but who are widely dispersed. However, perhaps the most significant consequence of Celtic rock has simply been as a general spur to immense musical and cultural creativity.

Celtic rock has also influenced musicians from countries and regions without Celtic communities, with some of them, like the Balkans, spawning their own Celtic rock scenes, which contributed to the interest for Celtic music and culture in local public. The pioneers of Celtic rock on the Yugoslav rock scene were the pub/garage rock band Roze Poze in the mid-1980s. In the 1990s, bands like Orthodox Celts from Serbia and Belfast Food from Croatia popularized Celtic rock further, influencing a number of younger acts, like Irish Stew of Sindidun.

<text>The position of Under-Secretary of State for War was a British government position, first applied to Evan Nepean (appointed in 1794). In 1801 the offices for War and the Colonies were merged and the post became that of Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. The position was re-instated in 1854 and remained until 1947, when it was combined with that of Financial Secretary to the War Office. In 1964 the War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry were merged to form the Ministry of Defence, and the post was abolished.

<text>A plant canker is a small area of dead tissue, which grows slowly, often over years. Some cankers are of only minor consequence, but others are ultimately lethal and therefore can have major economic implications for agriculture and horticulture. Their causes include a wide range of organisms as fungi, bacteria, mycoplasmas and viruses. The majority of canker-causing organisms are bound to a unique host species or genus, but a few will attack other plants. Weather (via frost or windstorm damage) and animal damage can also cause stress to the plant resulting in cankers. Other causes of cankers is pruning when the bark is wet or using un-sterilized tools.

Although fungicides or bactericides can treat some cankers, often the only available treatment is to destroy the infected plant to contain the disease.

==Examples==

* Apple canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Neonectria galligena&quot; formerly Nectria galligena.
* Ash bacterial canker, now understood to be caused by the bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas savastanoi&quot;, rather than &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot;. After DNA-relatedness studies &quot;Pseudomonas savastanoi&quot; has been instated as a new species.
* Butternut canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum&quot;
* Bleeding canker of horse chestnut, caused by the bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; pv. &quot;aesculi&quot;
* Citrus canker, caused by the bacterium &quot;Xanthomonas axonopodis&quot;
* Cypress canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Seiridium cardinale&quot;
* Foamy bark canker of oaks in California, caused by the fungus &quot;Geosmithia putterillii&quot;
* Dogwood anthracnose, caused by the fungus &quot;Discula destructiva&quot;
* Grape canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Eutypa lata&quot;
* Honey locust canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Thyronectria austro-americana&quot;
* Larch canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Lachnellula willkommii&quot;
* Mulberry canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Gibberella baccata&quot;
* Oak canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Diplodia quercina&quot;
* Pine pitch canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Fusarium circinatum&quot;
* Plane anthracnose, caused by the fungus &quot;Apiognomonia veneta&quot;
* Poplar canker, caused by the bacterium &quot;Xanthomonas populi&quot;
* Rapeseed stem canker, caused by the blackleg fungus &quot;Leptosphaeria maculans&quot;
* Rose cankers, caused by the fungus &quot;Leptosphaeria coniothyrium&quot; and &quot;Cryptosporella umbrina&quot;
* Scleroderris canker, caused by the fungus &quot;Gremmeniella abietina&quot;
* Southwest canker, caused by environmental conditions (frost damage and sun-scalding)
* Strawberry anthracnose, caused by the fungus species complexes &quot;Colletotrichum acutatum&quot; and &quot;C. gloeosporioides&quot; (incl. &quot;C. fragariae&quot;)
* Tomato anthracnose, caused by the fungus &quot;Colletotrichum coccodes&quot;
* Willow anthracnose, caused by the fungus &quot;Marssonina salicicola&quot;

<text>Gottschalk Eduard Guhrauer (15 May 1809 – 5 January 1854) was a German philologist and biographer. He is known principally for his 1842 biography of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and his completion (1853) of Theodor Wilhelm Danzel&#x27;s biography of Lessing, &quot;G. E. Lessing, sein Leben und seine Werke&quot; (1850–53, 2 volumes).

He was born in Bojanowo (then in Grand Duchy of Warsaw, now in Poland) and died in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland).

He studied philology and philosophy in Breslau and Berlin. Under the influence of the English missionary William Ayerst, Guhrauer converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1835. He traveled to Hanover in 1836 and Paris in 1838 to research Leibniz&#x27;s biography and works. After his return to Germany, he worked as a librarian at the University of Breslau, where he became a professor in 1843. Guhrauer also wrote on Jean Bodin, Joachim Jungius, the Kurmainz (Electorate of Mainz), and the Latin poem Vaticinium Lehninense.

<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s class K5 were experimental 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; types, built in 1929 to see if a larger Pacific than the standard K4s was worthwhile. Two prototypes were built, #5698 at the PRR&#x27;s own Altoona Works, and #5699 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Although classified identically, the two locomotives differed in many aspects, as detailed below. They were both fitted with a much wider boiler than the K4s, but dimensionally similar to those of the I1s 2-10-0 &quot;Decapods&quot;. Most other dimensions were enlarged over the K4s as well; the exceptions being the grate area and the drivers.

In comparison:
The K5&#x27;s factor of adhesion was much worse than the K4s&#x27;. This is because the K5 was more powerful than the K4s but with little more weight on drivers (and thus adhesion). Factors of adhesion below 4 are often considered undesirable for steam locomotives, and the K5 design did prove to be rather less sure-footed because of it. For this reason, 4-8-2 &quot;Mountain&quot; and 4-8-4 &quot;Northern&quot; designs with more drivers (and thus a greater allowable weight on drivers within the same axle load limit) were generally considered preferable for locomotives as powerful as the K5.

Both K5 locomotives were given a 130-P-75 tender carrying of water and of coal. Despite being such large locomotives built late in the steam era, both were equipped for hand firing. They were fitted with Worthington-pattern feedwater heaters, power reverse, unflanged main drivers, and both used nickel steel boiler shells. As built, both carried their bell on the smokebox front, hung below the headlight; this arrangement was common on other roads but at the time unique on the PRR.

== Altoona-built #5698 ==
K5 #5698 was built at the PRR&#x27;s Juniata Works (Juniata 4205 / 1929) in 1929, but having a works plate Altoona Works 4205 / 1929. This according to late Mr Ivan W. Saunders, Pittsburgh, Pa. A one-piece cast steel locomotive bed was used; this produced the locomotive frame, cylinders, and smokebox saddle as one giant steel casting. This casting was produced by Commonwealth Steel&#x27;s Granite City, Illinois plant. This cast locomotive bed design was a successful trial, and was repeated on 1930s order for 100 M1a class 4-8-2s, as was the Worthington feedwater heater with mixing chamber behind the stack.

K5 #5698 used conventional Walschaerts valve gear and piston valves, and developed a starting tractive effort of .

During the New York World’s Fair of 1939-40, K5 5698 was displayed along with several other PRR locomotives at the fair. Following the fair, in 1941 it was modified with a smokebox extension and a different feedwater heater within. 5698 was again modified by 1948 with a new (one-piece) smokebox, new cylinders with outside steam pipes, and “modern” front end.

In contrast, Baldwin-built #5699 (Baldwin 60660 / 1928) used a conventional, fabricated locomotive frame, longer smokebox with the feedwater mixing chamber in front of the stack and the generator mounted on the right side (below the stack), and separate cylinder plus half-saddle castings. The innovation trialled on #5699 was its use of Caprotti valve gear, a poppet valve gear invented in Italy. The greater efficiencies of this gear gave the locomotive a higher tractive effort of .

Although efficient, the Caprotti gear proved less reliable than the regular Walschaerts valve gear and required more frequent, more skilled maintenance, and in 1937 it was replaced by Walschaerts gear driving regular piston valves, making the two locomotives (except for frames) functionally identical.
== Service life ==

The two locomotives were originally assigned to haul Philadelphia to Pittsburgh through trains. After the electrification reached Harrisburg, they were reassigned to the twisting Harrisburg–Baltimore route. Finally, they were reassigned to Pittsburgh–Crestline trains.

Both were updated after World War 2 with the standard front-end &quot;beauty treatment&quot; given to most K4s locomotives: a sheet-steel drop coupler pilot, higher-mounted headlight, and turbo-generator mounted on the smokebox front for easier access. They lost their unique bell placement at this time for a location equally unique for the PRR: under the generator-service platform on the front of the smokebox.

== Conclusion ==
Like many experimental locomotives, the K5 was only a qualified success. Both locomotives performed well enough to be kept in service, but not enough to persuade the PRR to build more. They proved that building a larger Pacific than the K4s was not worthwhile, as the reduced factor of adhesion limited the locomotives&#x27; ability to put their greater power to full use. A larger locomotive with eight driving wheels was needed.

This route was eventually taken by the T1 4-4-4-4 duplex locomotives, but the Great Depression and the large cost of electrification meant that PRR steam locomotive development effectively ceased after the K5 and M1a. The electrical department became the thrust of PRR locomotive policy, and the displaced steam locomotives from electrified territory gave the PRR a surplus of locomotives, giving little incentive to develop more.

The cast steel locomotive bed and Worthington feedwater heater both proved themselves, and they became a feature of most PRR steam locomotives built after the K5, and indeed those on many other railroads.

Both locomotives were scrapped.

<text>The Collingridge dilemma is a methodological quandary in which efforts to influence or control the further development of technology face a double-bind problem:
* An information problem: impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.
* A power problem: control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.
The idea was coined by at the University of Aston Technology Policy Unit in his 1980 book &quot;The Social Control of Technology&quot;. The dilemma is a basic point of reference in technology assessment debates.

==Background==
In &quot;This Explains Everything,&quot; edited by John Brockman, technology critic Evgeny Morozov explains Collingridge&#x27;s idea by quoting Collingridge himself: &quot;When change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult, and time-consuming.&quot;

In &quot;The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; Technological Determinism&quot; by Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, the Collingridge dilemma is related to the &quot;pacing problem&quot; in technology regulation. The &quot;pacing problem&quot; refers to the notion that technological innovation is increasingly outpacing the ability of laws and regulations to keep up, first explained in Larry Downes&#x27; 2009 book &quot;The Laws of Disruption&quot;, in which he states that &quot;technology changes exponentially, but social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally&quot;. In Thierer&#x27;s essay, he tries to correlate these two concepts by saying that &quot;the &#x27;Collingridge dilemma&#x27; is simply a restatement of the pacing problem but with greater stress on the social drivers behind the pacing problem and an implicit solution to &#x27;the problem&#x27; in the form of preemptive control of new technologies while they are still young and more manageable.&quot;

One solution to Collingridge dilemma is the &quot;Precautionary Principle.&quot; Adam Thierer defines it as the belief that new innovations should not be embraced &quot;until their developers can prove that they will not cause any harm to individuals, groups, specific entities, cultural norms, or various existing laws, norms, or traditions&quot;. If they fail to do so, this innovation should be &quot;prohibited, curtailed, modified, junked, or ignored&quot;. This definition has been criticized by Kevin Kelly who believe such a principle is ill-defined and is biased against anything new because it drastically elevates the threshold for anything innovative. According to the American philosopher Max More, the Precautionary Principle &quot;is very good for one thing — stopping technological progress...not because it leads in bad directions, but because it leads in no direction at all.&quot; But the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development defines the precautionary principle as &quot;&quot;Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.&quot; So rather than conceived as imposing no change until proof of safety is produced, this definition of the precautionary principle is meant to legitimate protective measures, attempting to avoid the desire of a technology&#x27;s advocates to delay legislation until irrefutable evidence of harm can be produced.

Collingridge&#x27;s solution was not exactly the precautionary principle but rather the application of &quot;Intelligent Trial and Error,&quot; a process by which decision making power remains decentralized, changes are manageable, technologies and infrastructures are designed to be flexible, and the overall process is oriented towards learning quickly while keeping the potential costs as low as possible. Collingridge advocated ensuring that innovation occurs more incrementally so as to better match the pace of human learning and avoiding technologies whose design was antithetical to an Intelligent Trial and Error process.

==Current context==
The Collingridge Dilemma applies well to a world where Artificial Intelligence and Cloud are gaining ground and developers are consuming new technology at a rapid pace. Governing AI, Cloud or other similar exponential technology without slowing the pace of development of the technology is a big challenge, governments and organizations now face.

<text>Crows are a licorice candy identical in shape and texture to Dots. Their mascot is a crow with a top hat and cane.

==History==
Crows were invented in the 1890s by confectioners Henrique Cataldi and Joseph Maison. The Black Crows trademark was registered in 1911. There is an urban legend that Crows were to be called &quot;Black Rose&quot;, but the printer misheard the name as &quot;Black Crows&quot; and printed wrappers with the wrong name on them. This myth has been debunked.

In 1972, Tootsie Roll Industries acquired the Crows brand by purchasing the Mason Division of the Candy Corporation of America.

<doc id="1290436" wikidata="Q7700839" url="?curid=1290436" title="Tenterhook">
<text>Tenterhooks or tenter hooks are hooked nails used with a device known as a tenter, a wooden frame, used since at least the 14th century in the process of making woolen cloth, over which wet cloth would be stretched to prevent shrinkage as it dries, but now superseded by the stenter in the textile manufacturing industry.

The phrase &quot;on tenterhooks&quot; has become a metaphor for nervous anticipation.

== Cloth-making ==

After a piece of cloth was woven, it still contained oil and dirt from the fleece; a craftsmen known as a fuller (in Scotland, ), cleaned the woollen cloth in a fulling mill, and thereafter dry it without allowing the fabric to shrink. To this end, the fuller stretches the wet cloth over a large wooden frame, called a tenter (), leaving it to dry outdoors. The lengths of wet cloth were stretched on the tenter using &quot;tenterhooks&quot;, hooked nails made with a long shank that was driven into the wooden tenter frame around its perimeter, on which the selvedges were fixed so that the cloth would retain its shape and size as it dried. 

Historically, tentergrounds (alternatively, tenter-fields), large open spaces full of tenters, wherever cloth was made, and as a result the word &quot;tenter&quot; is found in place names throughout the United Kingdom and its former colonial possessions, for example several streets in Spitalfields, London, and Tenterfield House in Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland, which in turn gave its name to Tenterfield in New South Wales, Australia.

The word &quot;tenter&quot; is still used today to refer to production line machinery employed to stretch polyester films and similar fabrics. The spelling stenter is also found.

== Metaphor ==

By the mid-18th century, the phrase &quot;on tenterhooks&quot; came to mean being in a state of tension, uneasiness, anxiety, or suspense, i.e., figuratively stretched like the cloth on the tenter.

John Ford&#x27;s 1633 play &quot;Broken Heart&quot; contains the lines: &quot;There is no faith in woman. Passion, O, be contain&#x27;d! My very heart-strings Are on the tenters.&quot;

In 1690 the periodical &quot;The General History of Europe&quot; used the term in the modern sense: &quot;The mischief is, they will not meet again these two years, so that all business must hang upon the tenterhooks till then.&quot;

In 1826, English periodical &quot;Monthly magazine or British register of literature, sciences, and the belles-lettres&quot; contained the line &quot;I hope (though the wish is a cruel one) that my fair readers, if any such readers have deigned to follow me thus far, are on tenterhooks to know to whom the prize was adjudged.&quot; In a letter to his wife the same year, American educator Francis Wayland (waiting for his promised appointment as President of Brown University) wrote &quot;I was never so much on tenter hooks before.&quot;

The misuse of &quot;on tender hooks&quot; instead of &quot;on tenterhooks&quot; is one of the most misused English phrases, or eggcorns, according to a 2017 survey of two thousand British adults, ranking in fifth place.

<doc id="1290437" wikidata="Q2507541" url="?curid=1290437" title="Kate Thornton">
<text>Kate Thornton (born 7 February 1973) is an English journalist and broadcaster, best known as the first presenter of &quot;The X Factor&quot; (2004–2006) and for presenting daytime shows including &quot;Loose Women&quot; (2009–2011) and &quot;This Morning&quot; (2009–2012). In 2010, she co-presented the first series of &quot;71 Degrees North&quot; alongside Gethin Jones.

==Career==

===Journalism===

In 1995, at 21 she became the youngest editor of pop magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot;. She left a year later, having been unable to prevent a further slide in sales of the magazine. In 1997, she became a Features Editor at the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, a post she held until 2001, and also a contributing Editor for magazine &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, in which position she continued until 2003.

===Television===
Whilst undertaking these new editorial roles, Thornton began a second career in television. In February 1997, Thornton was given her first TV presenting job, on the ITV current affairs programme &quot;Straight Up&quot;. She was tasked with putting together a photo tribute with music for Princess Diana on the day of her death. In an interview in March 2011, Thornton said: &quot;...because it was a Sunday, the music library was shut and the only thing I had in my car, the only piece of music that was appropriate was &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; from Elton John&#x27;s greatest hits.&quot; Colleagues attributed the subsequent airplay and then the re-recording of the song to this event. Thornton is quoted as having been doubtful initially, but later having come to accept the possibility: &quot;I never dared to assume for one minute that I was the link. But Nick Knowles (co-presenter on the show) has convinced me that whatever came as a result of it was all down to me.&quot;

Thornton was the first presenter of the UK series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. She presented three series of the show from 2004 until 2006 before being replaced by Dermot O&#x27;Leary. Thornton later anchored ITV&#x27;s daytime series &quot;Loose Women&quot;, in rotation with Andrea McLean. She presented 233 episodes of the show from 2009. She, and fellow Loose Woman Zoë Tyler, were replaced in 2011 by Carol Vorderman and Sally Lindsay.

Thornton was a regular stand-in presenter on &quot;This Morning&quot; and in 2010, she co-presented the first series of &quot;71 Degrees North&quot; alongside Gethin Jones. Neither returned for the second series. In 2010, she narrated &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Abba Song&quot;. Thornton also presented &quot;A Night with Will Young&quot; in 2011. She guest presented six episodes of &quot;Lorraine&quot; in 2012.

Thornton also presented &quot;Gravity Games&quot; for BBC Two, &quot;Women: The Naked Truth Honest&quot; for Channel 4 and &quot;Breasts Uncupped&quot; for Sky1.

She currently hosts The Royal Beat - a topical royal chat show - on True Royalty TV, which is available via Amazon Prime and Apple TV. According to the blurb on the official website: “Every episode goes behind the headlines to bring to viewers fresh, detailed insight into the biggest royal stories from the UK and around the world.”

===Radio===
Thornton has presented a number of programmes for BBC Radio 2 since 2002. Along with presenting, Thornton was also the writer of the radio documentary &quot;From Band to Brand&quot; in 2004, and the creator of the radio series &quot;Line of Enquiry&quot;, inviting an audience to put questions to a number of celebrities, which began in 2007.

From 10 March until 28 April 2013, Thornton presented &quot;The Boots Feel Good Forum&quot;, a radio show dedicated to health and fitness, which aired on Real Radio and Smooth Radio.

From 2014 to 2016, Thornton presented &quot;Paper Cuts&quot;, a radio series for BBC Radio 2. The show ran for four series and, in the show, Thornton would chat to celebrities about the headlines they had been involved in. The first guest was Craig Revel Horwood. 

She joined Greatest Hits Radio on 26 February 2022, where she broadcasts every Sunday. She has taken over the weekday afternoon show from 11 November 2024.

===Other work===
Thornton launched cashback site TBSeen in January 2016, along with TV presenters Myleene Klass, Amanda Byram and Denise Van Outen, celebrity chef Lisa Faulkner, actresses Tamzin Outhwaite, Julie Graham and singers Heidi Range and the band All Saints, Nicole Appleton, Natalie Appleton, Mel Blatt and Shaznay Lewis. TBSeen entered administration in September 2018.

Thornton hosted the live &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; tour in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013.

In 2019 Kate launched &quot;White Wine Question Time&quot;, a podcast that sees her sit down with a celebrity guest each week to ask them three thought provoking questions over three glasses of wine. The podcast first aired in January 2019 with guests Heidi Range, Lisa Faulkner and Angela Griffin. There are currently over 300 episodes in the back catalogue featuring the likes of HRH Princess Eugenie, actress Hannah Waddingham, award winning singer Raye and a host of household names. 

During the UK&#x27;s COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, she also created and hosted &quot;Up Close And Socially Distant&quot;, a video series for Yahoo!, where she talked over video call to famous celebrities, front line workers and those leading initiatives to help serve the community during lockdown. The show ran for nine weeks and won a Silver Lovie award.

==Personal life==
Thornton began dating DJ Darren Emerson in 2004. The couple became engaged in 2007. She gave birth in 2008. The relationship with Emerson ended in 2011.

In January 2012, Thornton said that after leaving &quot;Loose Women&quot; she had enrolled at college to study counselling because her television career had &quot;hit the kerb&quot;.

<text>*Raidō &quot;ride&quot; (by extension &quot;journey, wagon etc&quot;) is the reconstructed Proto-Germanic name of the &quot;r&quot;- rune of the Elder Futhark . The name is attested for the same rune in all three rune poems, Old Norwegian Ræið Icelandic Reið, Anglo-Saxon Rad, as well as for the corresponding letter of the Gothic alphabet 𐍂 &quot;r&quot;, called raida. The shape of the rune may be directly derived from Latin &quot;R&quot;.

<text>Salix herbacea, the dwarf willow, least willow or snowbed willow, is a species of tiny creeping willow (family Salicaceae) adapted to survive in harsh arctic and subarctic environments. Distributed widely in alpine and arctic environments around the North Atlantic Ocean, it is one of the smallest woody plants.

==Distribution==

&quot;Salix herbacea&quot; is adapted to survive in harsh environments, and has a wide distribution on both sides of the North Atlantic, in arctic northwest Asia, northern Europe, Greenland, and eastern Canada, and further south on high mountains, south to the Pyrenees, the northern Apennines, the Alps and the Rila in Europe, and the northern Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. It grows in tundra and rocky moorland, usually at over elevation in the south of its range but down to sea level in the Arctic.

==Description==
The dwarf willow is one of the smallest woody plants in the world. It typically grows to only in height, with spreading prostrate branches, reddish brown and very sparsely hairy at first, growing just underground forming open mats. The leaves are deciduous, rounded, crenate to toothed and shiny green with paler undersides, 0.3–2 cm long and broad. Like other willows, it is dioecious, with male and female catkins on separate plants. As a result, the plant&#x27;s appearance varies; the female catkins are red-coloured when ripe, while the male catkins are yellow-coloured. In colder biomes with habitat fragmentation, geographic isolation, and heterogeneous availability of resources, the dwarf willow often exhibits clonal propagation of genets in which ramets are physiologically integrated and thereby share resources. Some genets of the dwarf willow in the Northern Apennines in Italy are at least 2000 years old.

<doc id="1290450" wikidata="Q3084127" url="?curid=1290450" title="Islam in Afghanistan">
<text>Sunni Islam (Hanafi/Deobandi) is the largest and the state religion of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Islam in Afghanistan began to be practiced after the Arab Islamic conquest of Afghanistan from the 7th to the 10th centuries, with the last holdouts to conversion submitting in the late 19th century. It was generally accepted by local communities as a replacement of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism, local tribes began converting to the new religion. Islam is the official state religion of Afghanistan, with approximately 99.7% of the Afghan population being Muslim. Roughly 85% practice Sunni Islam, while around 10% are Shias. Most Shias belong to the Twelver branch and only a smaller number follow Ismailism.

After the Islamic conquest of Persia was completed, the Muslim Arabs then began to move towards the lands east of Persia and in 652 captured Herat. By the end of the 10th century CE the Turkic Ghaznavids subdued Kabul Shahi kings.

==History==

During the 7th century, the Rashidun Caliphate Arabs entered the territory that is now Afghanistan after defeating the Sassanid Persians in Nihawand. After this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid emperor, Yazdegerd III, fled eastward deep into Central Asia. In pursuing Yazdegerd, the Arabs entered the area from northeastern Iran via Herat, where they stationed a large portion of their army before advancing toward northern Afghanistan.

Many of the inhabitants of northern Afghanistan accepted Islam through Umayyad missionary efforts, particularly under the reign of Caliph Hisham and Umar ibn AbdulAziz. In the south, Abdur Rahman bin Samara made incursions into Zabulistan which was ruled by the Zunbils.

During the reign of Al-Mu&#x27;tasim and his successors, Islam was generally practiced by most inhabitants of the region, and after Abbasid decline, under Ya&#x27;qub-i Laith Saffari, Islam was the predominant religion of Kabul and other major cities of Afghanistan. The father of Abu Hanifa, Thabit bin Zuta, was born in the territory that is now Afghanistan. He emigrated to Kufa (in Iraq), where Hanifa was born. Later, the Samanids propagated Sunni Islam deep into Central Asia, and the first complete translation of the Qur&#x27;an into Persian was made in the 9th century. Since then, Islam has dominated the country&#x27;s religious landscape. Islamic leaders have entered the political sphere at various times of crisis but rarely exercised secular authority for long.

The remnants of a Shahi presence in Peshawar were expelled by Mahmud of Ghazni in 998 and 1030. The Ghaznavids were replaced by the Ghurid dynasty who expanded the already powerful Islamic empire. The Friday Mosque of Herat is one of the oldest mosques in the country, believed to have been first built under the Ghurids in the 12th century. During this period, known as the Islamic Golden Age, Afghanistan became the second major center of learning in the Muslim world after Baghdad.

After the Mongol invasion and destruction, the Timurids rebuilt the area and once again made it a center of Islamic learning. Shia Islam made its way to southern Afghanistan during the Safavid rule in the 16th century. Until Mir Wais Hotak liberated the Afghans in 1709, the Kandahar region of Afghanistan was often a battleground between the Shia Safavids and the Sunni Mughals.

===Conquest by Abdur Rahman Khan===
The first systematic employment of Islam as an instrument of state-building was initiated by King Abdur Rahman Khan (1880–1901) during his drive toward centralization. He decreed that all laws must comply with Islamic law and thus elevated the Shariah over customary laws embodied in the Pashtunwali. The ulama were enlisted to legitimize and sanction his state efforts as well as his central authority. This enhanced the religious community on the one hand, but as they were increasingly inducted into the bureaucracy as servants of the state, the religious leadership was ultimately weakened. Many economic privileges enjoyed by religious personalities and institutions were restructured within the framework of the state; the propagation of learning, once the sole prerogative of the ulama, was closely supervised; and the Amir became the supreme arbiter of justice.

Abdur Rahman Khan&#x27;s successors continued and expanded his policies as they increased the momentum of secularization. Islam remained central to interactions, but the religious establishment remained essentially non-political, functioning as a moral rather than a political influence. Nevertheless, Islam asserted itself in times of national crisis. Moreover, when the religious leadership considered themselves severely threatened, charismatic religious personalities periodically employed Islam to rally disparate groups in opposition to the state. They rose up on several occasions against King Amanullah Shah (1919–1929), for example, in protest against reforms they believed to be western intrusions inimical to Islam.

Subsequent rulers, mindful of traditional attitudes antithetical to secularization, were careful to underline the compatibility of Islam with modernization. Even so, and despite its pivotal position within the society, which continued to draw no distinction between religion and state, the role of religion in state affairs continued to decline.

The 1931 Constitution made Hanafi Shariah the state religion, while the 1964 Constitution simply prescribed that the state should conduct its religious ritual according to the Hanafi school. The 1977 Constitution declared Islam the religion of Afghanistan, but made no mention that the state ritual should be Hanafi. The Penal Code of 1976 and the Civil Code of 1977, covering the entire field of social justice, represent major attempts to cope with elements of secular law based on, but superseded by, other systems. Courts, for instance, were enjoined to consider cases first according to secular law, resorting to Shariah in areas secular law did not cover. By 1978, the government of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) openly expressed its aversion to the religious establishment. Nonetheless, Islamic rhetoric was still utilized by PDPA politicians throughout its existence, with Hafizullah Amin declaring that the PDPA was based upon Islamic principles. The largely secular PDPA rule precipitated the fledgling Islamist Movement into a national revolt; Islam moved from its passive stance on the periphery to play an active role.

Politicized Islam in Afghanistan represents a break from Afghan traditions. The Islamist Movement originated in 1958 among faculties of Kabul University, particularly in the Faculty of Islamic Law, which had been founded in 1952 with the stated purpose of raising the quality of religious teaching to accommodate modern science and technology. The founders were largely professors influenced by the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, a party formed in the 1930s that was dedicated to Islamic revivalism and social, economic, and political equity. Their objective is to come to terms with the modern world through the development of a political ideology based on Islam. The Afghan leaders, while indebted to many of these concepts, did not forge strong ties to similar movements in other countries.

The liberalization of government attitudes following the passage of the 1964 Constitution ushered in a period of intense activism among students at Kabul University. Professors and their students set up the Muslim Youth Organization (Sazmani Jawanani Musulman) in the mid-1960s at the same time that the leftists were also forming many parties. Initially communist students outnumbered the Muslim students, but by 1970 the Muslim Youth had gained a majority in student elections. Their membership was recruited from university faculties and from secondary schools in several cities such as Mazari Sharif and Herat. Some of these professors and students became the leaders of the Mujahideen rebels in the 1980s.

===Radicalization and NATO presence===
The 1979 Soviet invasion in support of a communist government triggered a major intervention of religion into Afghan political conflict, and Islam united the multiethnic political opposition. With the takeover of government by the PDPA in April 1978, Islam had already become central to uniting the opposition against the communist ideology of the new rulers.

The Soviet invasion and the Iranian Revolution not only led national uprisings but also the importation of foreign radical Muslims to Afghanistan. The mujahideen leaders were charismatic figures with dyadic ties to followers. In many cases military and political leaders replaced the tribal leadership; at times the religious leadership was strengthened; often the religious combined with the political leadership. Followers selected their local leaders on the basis of personal choice and precedence among regions, sects, ethnic groups or tribes, but the major leaders rose to prominence through their ties to outsiders who controlled the resources of money and arms.

With the support of foreign aid, the mujahideen were ultimately successful in their jihad to drive out the Soviet forces, but not in their attempts to construct a political alternative to govern Afghanistan after their victory. Throughout the war, the mujahideen were never fully able to replace traditional structures with a modern political system based on Islam. Most mujahideen commanders either used traditional patterns of power, becoming the new khans, or sought to adapt modern political structures to the traditional society. In time the prominent leaders accumulated wealth and power and, in contrast to the past, wealth became a determining factor in the delineation of power at all levels.

With the departure of foreign troops and the long sought demise of Kabul&#x27;s leftist government, The Islamic State of Afghanistan finally came into being in April 1992. This represented a distinct break with Afghan history, for religious specialists had never before exercised state power. But the new government failed to establish its legitimacy and, as much of its financial support dissipated, local and middle range commanders and their militia not only fought among themselves but resorted to a host of unacceptable practices in their protracted scrambles for power and profit. Throughout the nation the populace suffered from harassment, extortion, kidnapping, burglary, hijacking and acts dishonoring women. Drug trafficking increased alarmingly; nowhere were the highways safe. The mujahideen had forfeited the trust they once enjoyed.

In the fall of 1994 a group called the Taliban came forth vowing to cleanse the nation of warlords and criminals. Their intention was to create a &quot;pure&quot; Islamic government subject to their own strict interpretations of the Shariah. Many Pakistani politicians supported the Taliban, including Sami ul Haq who is regarded as the Father of the Taliban. A number of its leaders were one-time mujahideen members, but the bulk of their forces were young Afghan refugees trained in Pakistani madrassas (religious schools), especially those run by the Jamiat-e Ulema-e Islam Pakistan, the aggressively conservative Pakistani political religious party headed by Maulana Fazlur Rahman, arch rival of Qazi Hussain Ahmad, leader of the equally conservative Jamaat-e-Islami and longtime supporter of the mujahideen.

Headquartered in Kandahar, mostly Pashtuns from the rural areas, and from the top leadership down to the fighting militia characteristically in their thirties or forties and even younger, the Taliban swept the country. In September 1996 they captured Kabul and ruled over most of Afghanistan by 2001. The meteoric take over went almost unchallenged. Arms were collected and security was established. At the same time, acts committed for the purpose of enforcing the Shariah included public executions of murderers, stoning for adultery, amputation for theft, a ban on all forms of gambling such as kite flying, chess and cockfights, prohibition of music and videos, proscriptions against pictures of humans and animals, and an embargo on women&#x27;s voices over the radio. Women were to remain as invisible as possible, behind the veil, in purdah in their homes, and dismissed from work or study outside their homes. They were toppled by a combined Afghan-NATO military force in late 2001. The majority of them escaped to neighboring Pakistan from where they launched an insurgency against the current NATO-backed Afghan government. Peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government were ongoing as of 2013.

==Islam in Afghan society==
For Afghans, Islam represents a potentially unifying symbolic system which offsets the divisiveness that frequently rises from the existence of a deep pride in tribal loyalties and an abounding sense of personal and family honor found in multitribal and multiethnic societies such as Afghanistan.

Islam is a central, pervasive influence throughout Afghan society; religious observances punctuate the rhythm of each day and season. In addition to a central congregational Mosque for weekly communal prayers which are obligatory for men in Islam (but not for woman) and are generally well attended, smaller community-maintained mosques stand at the center of villages, as well as town and city neighborhoods. Masjids serve not only as places of worship, but for a multitude of functions, including shelter for guests, places to meet, the focus of social religious festivities and schools. Almost every Afghan has at one time during his youth studied at a mosque school; for many this is the only formal education they receive.

Because Islam is a way of life and functions as a comprehensive code of social behavior regulating all human relationships, individual and family status depends on the proper observance of the society&#x27;s value system based on concepts defined in Islam. These are characterized by honesty, frugality, generosity, virtuousness, piousness, fairness, truthfulness, tolerance and respect for others. To uphold family honor, elders also control the behavior of their children according to these same Islamic prescriptions. At times, even competitive relations between tribal or ethnic groups are expressed in terms claiming religious superiority. In short, Islam structures day-to-day interactions of all members of the community.

The religious establishment has several levels. Any Muslim can lead informal groups in prayer. Mullahs who officiate at mosques are normally appointed by the government after consultation with their communities and, although partially financed by the government, mullahs are largely dependent for their livelihood on community contributions including shelter and a portion of the harvest. Supposedly versed in the Qur&#x27;an, Sunnah, Hadith and Shariah, they must ensure that their communities are knowledgeable in the fundamentals of Islamic ritual and behavior. This qualifies them to arbitrate disputes over religious interpretation. Often they function as paid teachers responsible for religious education classes held in mosques where children learn basic moral values and correct ritual practices. Their role has additional social aspects for they officiate on the occasion of life crisis rituals associated with births, marriages and deaths.

But rural mullahs are not part of an institutionalized hierarchy of clergy. Most are part-time mullahs working also as farmers or craftsmen. Some are barely literate, or only slightly more educated than the people they serve. Often, but by no means always, they are men of minimal wealth and, because they depend for their livelihood on the community that appoints them, they have little authority even within their own social boundaries. They are often treated with scant respect and are the butt of a vast body of jokes making fun of their arrogance and ignorance. Yet their role as religious arbiters forces them to take positions on issues that have political ramifications and since mullahs often disagree with one another, pitting one community against the other, they are frequently perceived as disruptive elements within their communities.

Veneration of saints and shrines is opposed by some Islamic groups, particularly those ascribing to the Salafi or Ahle Hadith. Nevertheless, Afghanistan&#x27;s landscape is liberally strewn with shrines honoring saints of all descriptions. Many of Afghanistan&#x27;s oldest villages and towns grew up around shrines of considerable antiquity. Some are used as sanctuaries by fugitives.

Shrines vary in form from simple mounds of earth or stones marked by pennants to lavishly ornamented complexes surrounding a central domed tomb. These large establishments are controlled by prominent religious and secular leaders. Shrines may mark the final resting place of a fallen hero (shahid), a venerated religious teacher, a renowned Sufi poet, or relics, such as a hair of Muhammad or a piece of his cloak (khirqah). A great many commemorate legends about the miraculous exploits of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth caliph and the first Imam of Shi&#x27;a Islam believed to be buried at the nation&#x27;s most elaborate shrine located in the heart of Mazari Sharif, the Exalted Shrine. Ali is revered throughout Afghanistan for his role as an intermediary in the face of tyranny.

Festive annual fairs celebrated at shrines attract thousands of pilgrims and bring together all sections of communities. Pilgrims also visit shrines to seek the intercession of the saint for special favors, be it a cure for illness or the birth of a son. Women are particularly devoted to activities associated with shrines. These visits may be short or last several days and many pilgrims carry away specially blessed curative and protective amulets (usually a tawiz) to ward off the evil eye, assure loving relationships between husbands and wives and many other forms of solace. Like saint veneration, such practices are generally not encouraged in Islam according to classical understanding of the Holy Qu&#x27;ran and Hadiths (prophetic sayings of the Rabi)

==Shia Islam in Afghanistan==

Roughly 10% of the Afghan population is Shia. Majority of Shias in Afghanistan belong to the Twelver branch. This includes the Hazara ethnic group and the smaller urbanized Qizilbash group, who are originally from eastern Iran.

Politically aware Shia students formed the Afghan Maoist movement in the 1960s and early 1970s. After the Saur Revolution (April Revolution) of 1978 and the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Shia rebel groups in the Hazarajat region, although frequently at odds with one another, became active in mujahideen activities. They were aided by Shi&#x27;a Iran and fought against the Soviet-backed Afghan government as well as other mujahideen groups.

During the political maneuvering leading up to the establishment of the Islamic State of Afghanistan in 1992, the Shi&#x27;a groups unsuccessfully negotiated for more equitable, consequential political and social roles.

===Ismailism===

The Ismailis accepted Ismail ibn Jafar instead of Musa al-Kadhim as the successor to Imam Jafar as-Sadiq. Ismaili communities in Afghanistan are less populous than the Twelver who consider the Ismaili heretical. They are found primarily in and near the eastern Hazarajat, in the Baghlan area north of the Hindu Kush, among the mountain Tajik of Badakhshan, and amongst the Wakhi in the Wakhan Corridor. The Ismailis believe that the series of Imamat or in another word Welayat that comes from the first Imami, Hazar-e-Ali, will never end. The 49th imam is Aga Khan IV. 
During the 1980s Soviet war in Afghanistan Sayed Jafar Naderi was the Ismaili commander, called the &#x27;Warlord of Kayan&#x27; in a documentary by Journeyman Pictures. 

Following the fall of Taliban in 2001, Ismailis established a political party called the National Unity Party of Afghanistan, also known as the National Solidarity Party of Afghanistan which had seats in the Afghan government cabinet, including the State Ministry for Peace in 2020. In 2009, 2014 and 2019 presidential elections it backed Hamid Karzai in 2009, Ashraf Ghani in 2014 and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah in 2019. 

==Sufi influences==

Three Sufi orders are prominent: the Naqshbandiya founded in Bukhara, the Qadiriya founded in Baghdad, and the Cheshtiya located at Chesht-i-Sharif east of Herat. Among the Naqshbandi, Ahmad al Faruqi Kabuli, born north of Kabul, acquired renown for his teachings in India during the reign of the Moghul Emperor Akbar in the sixteenth century.

Another famous Qadiriya pir named Mawlana Faizani came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, and was a leading critic against the creeping influence of communist philosophy. Jailed in the mid-70s, Mawlana Faizani disappeared when the khalqis came to power and remains missing to this day.

The Cheshtiya order was founded by Mawdid al-Cheshti who was born in the twelfth century and later taught in India. The Cheshtiya brotherhood, concentrated in the Hari River valley around Obe, Karukh and Chehst-i-Sharif, is very strong locally and maintains madrasas with fine libraries. Traditionally the Cheshtiya have kept aloof from politics, although they were effectively active during the resistance within their own organizations and in their own areas.

Herat and its environs has the largest number and greatest diversity of Sufi branches, many of which are connected with local tombs of pir (ziarat). Other Sufi groups are found all across the north, with important centers in Maimana, Faryab Province, and in Kunduz. The brotherhoods in Kabul and around Mazari Sharif are mostly associated with the Naqshbandiya. The Qadiriya are found mainly among the eastern Pashtun of Wardak, Paktia and Nangarhar, including many Ghilzai nomadic groups. Other smaller groups are settled in Kandahar and in Shindand, Farah Province. The Cheshtiya are centered in the Hari River valley. There are no formal Sufi orders among the Shi&#x27;a in the central Hazarajat, although some of the concepts are associated with Sayyids, descendants of Mohammad, who are especially venerated among the Shi&#x27;a.

Afghanistan is unique in that there is little hostility between the ulama (religion scholars) and the Sufi orders. A number of Sufi leaders are considered as ulama, and many ulama closely associate with Sufi brotherhoods. The general populace accords Sufis respect for their learning and for possessing karamat, the psychic spiritual power conferred upon them by God that enables pirs to perform acts of generosity and bestow blessings (barakat). Sufism therefore is an effective popular force. In addition, since Sufi leaders distance themselves from the mundane, they are at times turned to as more disinterested mediators in tribal disputes in preference to mullahs who are reputed to escalate minor secular issues into volatile confrontations couched in Islamic rhetoric.

Despite the Afghan Sufis&#x27; stable position in Afghan society, Sufi leaders were among those executed following the Saur Revolution, among them Baha&#x27;uddin Jan, the &quot;pir naqshbandi&quot; of the Aimaq of Purchaman District, Farah.

<doc id="1290471" wikidata="Q1506804" url="?curid=1290471" title="George A. Sheridan">
<text>George Augustus Sheridan (February 22, 1840 – October 7, 1896) was an American Civil War veteran and politician who, along with Effingham Lawrence is known for serving for the shortest term in congressional history, serving for just one day in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Biography==
Sheridan was born in Millbury, Massachusetts, and moved with his parents to Chicago in 1858.

=== Civil War ===
During the Civil War, he served as a captain in the Union Army until his resignation on October 28, 1864.

After the war, Sheridan was one of a group of Northern officials who moved in to administer the defeated Southern states (often derisively referred to by Southerners as &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;). In 1866, he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana; where he served as brigadier general of the militia on the staff of the Republican Governor, Henry Clay Warmoth. In 1867, Sheridan was made sheriff of Carroll Parish in northeastern Louisiana, which was later divided into East Carroll and West Carroll parishes.

=== Congress ===
Sheridan ran for the House in 1872 as a Liberal Republican against then Lt. Gov. P. B. S. Pinchback. After the election, Pinchback would become the first black governor of a U.S. state following the impeachment of the prior governor Henry C. Warmoth. Pinchback originally had credentials to be seated and the House was inclined to do so, but did not wish to be as he had also won a seat in the Senate (that he was never allowed to take). Sheridan contested the election and the matter wasn&#x27;t fully settled until March 3, 1875, the last day of Congress. He was sworn in in the morning, serving until noon the next day.

=== After Congress ===
After his service in the House, he was appointed Recorder of Deeds in the District of Columbia by President Rutherford Hayes, serving from May 17, 1878, until May 17, 1881, when President James Garfield fired him in order to provide the job to Frederick Douglass.

=== Family ===
His daughter was the actress, Emma Sheridan.

=== Death ===
Sheridan died at the age of fifty-six in the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Hampton, Virginia. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Côte-Nord ( Region 09) (, ; ) is an administrative region of Quebec, on the Quebec-Labrador Peninsula, Canada.

The region runs along the St. Lawrence River and then the Gulf of St. Lawrence, from Tadoussac to the limits of Labrador, leaning against the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean to the west, the Côte-Nord penetrates deep into Northern Quebec.

With the motto: &quot;Between nature and excess&quot;, the Côte-Nord is made up of 99% public land, it is the second largest region after Nord-du-Québec, which occupies 51% of Quebec&#x27;s territory.

==History==

The origins of the settlement of the Côte-Nord precede by a few millennia the population movements that began in the middle of the 19th century.

Archaeologists tell us that the main prehistoric cultures, called &quot;archaic&quot;, were based on three sets of groups coming from the southwest, from as far away as the Great Lakes by the St. Lawrence River, those coming from the great plateaus of the interior and James Bay and those from Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.

From the 14th to the 17th century, known history, the presence of Europeans in the regions of the North Shore and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence began with the periodic visits of the Basques and Breton fishermen.
Until the advent of the World War II (1939-1945) the growth of the population occurred in concert with the development of the pulp and paper industry.

In the 1950s, mining caused massive immigration.

&quot;... From Kegashka to Blanc-Sablon, the inhabitants are individualistic, dwell on Crown Lands — often as squatters — and keep jealously to their self-appropriated fishing spots, whence their dispersion.&quot; (Bussières, P., p.1, 1963)

==Geography==

The Côte-Nord is bounded to the west by the Capitale-Nationale and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean regions and, to the north, by the Nord-du-Québec region and by Labrador. To the south, it extends from Tadoussac to the east of Blanc-Sablon, encompassing Anticosti Island and part of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Côte-Nord was created as an administrative region in 1966. Stretching over nearly 1,250 km and with an area of 196,058 km², the administrative region roughly includes the basins of all the rivers that flow into the St. Lawrence between Tadoussac and Blanc-Sablon.

Important landmarks of Côte-Nord include Anticosti Island, the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, and the Manicouagan Reservoir.

A territorial dispute between Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador concerning the border between Côte-Nord and Labrador was set on 2 March 1927 by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The boundary was entrenched in the Canadian constitution upon Newfoundland joining confederation in 1949. While this border has not been formally accepted by the Quebec government, the Henri Dorion Commission (Commission d&#x27;étude sur l&#x27;intégrité du territoire du Québec) concluded in the early 1970s that Quebec no longer has a legal claim to Labrador.

==Protection of natural heritage==
Several portions of territory on the Côte-Nord are dedicated specifically to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity. The region has 262 wildlife habitats, 172 aquatic bird concentration areas, 12 heronries, 66 bird colonies on islands, peninsulas or cliffs, 4 muskrat habitats and 8 white-tailed deer containment areas on Anticosti Island.

Overwiew of the diversity

===Avi-fauna===
An important migratory stopover for birds, the Côte-Nord offers many favourite sites to observe 350 listed species at leisure.

The diversity of habitats favours the presence of many avian species. According to the Manicouagan Ornithology Club, a wide variety of birds have been observed on the Côte-Nord including:
*Gavia stellata. — Plongeon catmarin. — (Red-throated loon).
*Sterna paradisaea. — Sterne arctique. — (Arctic tern).

==Economy==

The hydrography of the Côte-Nord has always been considered over the centuries as a structuring element, whether for exchanges between indigenous nations, for the beginning of colonization, for logging and transport of wood and, more recently, for the development of hydroelectricity and recreational tourism.

Mining, forestry, hydroelectric power, aluminum processing and fishing constitute the main regional economic activities. These activities are confronted with global markets and natural and human upheavals which affect resources such as fires and insect epidemics.

The region has 121 companies that have permits for the exploitation of granite quarries, sand pits, gravel pits and peat bogs. The exploitation of the latter also represents 50% of Quebec production. Considering the presence of numerous peatlands throughout the territory, vast reserves of high quality are still unexploited.

The presence of major contract givers, access to the St. Lawrence Seaway, three major seaports (Baie-Comeau, Port-Cartier and Sept-Îles, as well as cruise ship ports of call), good air and rail transport in a territory with potential for tourist development constitute the main economic assets of the region.

In addition, with 2,400 kilometers of snowmobile trails, the region is appreciated by fans of this winter sport. The rights of way granted on public land to various snowmobile clubs contribute to the development of this form of winter tourism which boosts the local and regional economy.
==Administrative divisions==
===Regional county municipalities (RCM)===
Caniapiscau — La Haute-Côte-Nord — Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent — Manicouagan — Minganie — Sept-Rivières

===Indian reserves===
Essipit — La Romaine — Lac-John — Maliotenam (part of Uashat-Maliotenam) — Matimekosh — Mingan — Nutashkuan — Pessamit — Uashat (part of Uashat-Maliotenam)

===Naskapi reserved territory===
* Kawawachikamach

==Population==
Between Sept-Îles and Natashquan, people arrive by sea, settle in complete freedom, without fees, depending on the salmon fishing at the mouths of the rivers, the banks of cod offshore, the trapping of fur-bearing animals in some cases and hunting seals other times.

At the 2016 Canadian Census, the population amounted to 92,518, approximately 1.1% of the province&#x27;s population, spread across 33 municipalities, various Indian reserves and a Naskapi reserved land. The towns of Baie-Comeau and Sept-Îles combined amount to a little more than half of the population of the region.

=== Demographics ===
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Côte-Nord region had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of -4.3% from its 2016 population of 92,518, making it the fastest-decreasing region of Québec. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The median age is 46.4, as opposed to 41.6 for all of Canada. French was the mother tongue of 84.9% of residents in 2021. The next most common mother tongues were the Cree-Innu languages at 7.8% total, followed by English at 4.5%. 0.6% reported both English and French as their first language. Additionally, there were 0.8% who reported both French and a non-official language as their mother tongue, mostly speakers of Cree-Innu languages.

Speakers of Cree-Innu languages mostly live in Pessamit and Uashat-Maliotenam. English speakers mostly live in Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality.

As of 2021, Indigenous peoples comprised 16.2% of the population and visible minorities contributed 1.5%. The largest visible minority groups in Côte-Nord are Black (0.7%), Arab (0.2%), and Latin American (0.2%). The region is home to 280 recent immigrants (i.e. those arriving between 2016 and 2021). 130 of them come from various African countries.

In 2021, 71.3% of the population identified as Catholic, while 19.6% said they had no religious affiliation. Anglicans were the largest religious minority, at 1.9% of the population, while Muslims were the largest non-Christian religious minority, making up 0.4% of the population.

==Major communities==
Baie-Comeau — Fermont — Forestville — Havre-Saint-Pierre — Port-Cartier — Sept-Îles

==Exploration==
The Côte-Nord region was gradually explored by French colonists during the centuries with the help of natives. There was a contribution by Henry de Puyjalon (1841-1905), a pioneer in ecology who devoted his life to the exploration of this region.

<text>Mary Alicia Rhett (February 1, 1915 – January 3, 2014) was an American actress and portrait painter who is best remembered for her role as India Wilkes in the 1939 epic film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. At the time of her death, Rhett was one of the oldest surviving credited cast members of the movie.

==Early years==
Rhett was born in 1915 in Savannah, Georgia to Isobel Murdoch, an immigrant from Liverpool, England, and Edmund M. Rhett, an American army officer and engineer based in Savannah. Her grandfather was Col. Alfred Moore Rhett, the commander of the 1st South Carolina Artillery for most of the civil war, and her great-grandfather was Robert Barnwell Rhett, Alfred Rhett&#x27;s father. After her father&#x27;s death during World War I, Alicia and her mother moved to Charleston, South Carolina. Rhett became a theatre actress in Charleston. A newspaper article in 1939 quoted a Selznick International Pictures news release as saying that Rhett Butler&#x27;s first name was chosen by Margaret Mitchell because &quot;Since earliest Colonial days, the Rhett family has occupied a prominent position in the South generally, and, more particularly, in and around Charleston, S.C.&quot;

Alicia Rhett graduated from Memminger High School in Charleston.

==&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;==
During a performance of &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; in 1936, Rhett was spotted by Hollywood director George Cukor, who was impressed by her charm and beauty. The director was scouting for an actress to play the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara after producer David Selznick purchased the film rights to the Margaret Mitchell novel. Previously, she had been suggested by talent scout Kay Brown as a possible Southern belle for the film.

Rhett auditioned for the part of Melanie Hamilton, but the role went instead to Olivia de Havilland. In March 1937, Cukor offered Rhett the role of India Wilkes, sister of Ashley Wilkes. After the success of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Rhett left Hollywood and returned to South Carolina and retired from filmmaking in 1941, citing a lack of suitable roles. Rhett later became an accent coach for aspiring actors and a radio announcer at station WTMA in Charleston.

==Portrait painter==
Prior to appearing in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Rhett showed talent as a sketch artist and portrait painter. Between takes on &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, she made sketches and drawings of her fellow actors. Soon, Rhett was creating portraits of American servicemen in the Charleston vicinity.

==Death==
Rhett died at age 98 of natural causes on January 3, 2014, at Bishop Gadsden Episcopal Retirement Community in her longtime hometown of Charleston, South Carolina. In her obituaries, Rhett was cited as having been &quot;the oldest living actor from &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;&quot;, being 17 months older than Dame Olivia de Havilland.

<doc id="1290481" wikidata="Q6932401" url="?curid=1290481" title="Amir Khan (Tonk State)">
<text>Nawab Amir Khan (1769–1834) was a military general in the service of Yashwantrao Holkar of the Maratha Empire and later became the first ruler of the princely state of Tonk (in present day Rajasthan, India). Amir Khan was a Hindustani Pathan and a North Indian Muslim. Born and bred in Sambhal, Amir Khan was the son of a &quot;Zamindar&quot; in Uttar Pradesh, Hayat Khan, while his grandfather Taleh Khan was a Pashtun from the Salarzai tribe, sub-tribe of Illyaszai of Musazai Yusufzai Tribe of District Buner in modern-day Pakistan who had migrated to and acquired land in Rohilkhand.

Amir Khan rose to be a military commander in the service of Yashwantrao Holkar of the Maratha Empire in 1798. In 1806, Khan received the state of Tonk from Yashwantrao Holkar of the Maratha Empire. Amir Khan&#x27;s troops were composed of Hindustani Pathans from Uttar Pradesh, Afridis of Malihabad in Oudh, and south-country Hindus. The Hindustani immigrants also included Indian Muslims from Hindustan such as Mir Zafar Ali, a Barha Sayyid of Fatehpur Haswa in Oudh.

While the Pindaris tended to concentrate on the east and south central India, Amir Khan and his Pathans concentrated on the north and Rajasthan. At the height of his power, he is said to have controlled a personal following of 8,000 cavalry, 10,000 infantry and up to 200 guns. The largest contingent amongst the Maratha chiefs, by far.

After the defeat of the Rohillas in the Rohilla War of 1774–5 against the British, he fought against them. He had acquired the town and &quot;pargana&quot; of Tonk and the title of &quot;Nawab&quot; from Yashwantrao Holkar in 1806, and this area together with some other scattered &quot;parganas&quot; that he held, was combined with the pargana of Rampura (Aligarh) and erected into a new principality. Ultimately he established his rule in Tonk in 1806.

In 1817, after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Amir Khan submitted to the British British East India Company, the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief, The Marquess of Hastings, resolved to extinguish the Pindaris whom they deemed a menace. The Treaty of Gwalior severed the link between them and Scindia. Moreover, the treaty required the latter to join forces with the British to eliminate the Pindaris and Pashtuns.

Bowing to the inevitable, Amir Khan assiduously came to terms with the British, agreeing to disband his men in return for a large stipend and recognition as a hereditary ruler. Amir Khan was recognized as hereditary nawab, disbanded his forces and quietly settled down to consolidating his little state. He became a faithful friend to the British, earning praise and consideration from successive pro-consuls.

Amir Khan died in 1834. He was succeeded by his son Muhammad Wazir Khan (r. 1834–1864).

<text>The Gutes (Old West Norse: &quot;Gotar&quot;, Old Gutnish: &quot;Gutar&quot;) were a North Germanic tribe inhabiting the island of Gotland. The ethnonym is related to that of the &quot;Goths&quot; (&quot;Gutans&quot;), and both names were originally Proto-Germanic *&quot;Gutaniz&quot;. Their language is called Gutnish (&quot;gutniska&quot;). They are one of the progenitor groups of modern Swedes, along with historical Swedes and Geats.

==Name==

The name of the Gutes in Old West Norse is &quot;Gotar (adj. gotneskr)&quot;, which is the same as that used for the Goths. Old Norse sources such as the sagas do not distinguish between the Goths and the Gutes. In accordance, the Old East Norse term for both Goths and Gutes seems to have been &quot;Gutar&quot; ( &quot;gutniskr&quot;). Only the Goths and Gutes bear this name among all the Germanic tribes, even if &quot;Geat&quot; is closely related.

The fact that the ethnonym is identical to &quot;Goth&quot; may be the reason why they are not mentioned as a special group until Jordanes&#x27; Getica, where they may be those who are called &quot;Vagoth&quot; (see Scandza). However, Ptolemy mentions the Goutai as living in the south of the island of Scandza; these could be identical to the Gutes, since the &quot;ou&quot;-spelling in Ancient Greek corresponds to the Latin and Germanic &quot;u&quot;.

==History==
The oldest history of the Gutes is retold in the &quot;Gutasaga&quot;. According to legend they descended from a man named Þjelvar who was the first to discover Gotland. Þjelvar had a son named Hafþi who wedded a fair maiden named Hvitastjerna. These two were the first to settle on Gotland. Hafþi and Hvitastjerna later had three children, Guti, Graipr and Gunfjaun. After the death of their parents, the brothers divided Gotland into three parts and each took one, but Guti remained the highest chieftain and gave his name to the land and its people.

It is related that because of overpopulation one third of the &quot;Gutes&quot; had to emigrate and settle in southern Europe:

:&quot;Over a long time, the people descended from these three multiplied so much that the land couldn&#x27;t support them all. Then they draw lots, and every third person was picked to leave, and they could keep everything they owned and take it with them, except for their land. ... they went up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came to the land of the Greeks. ... they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language.&quot;

Some scholars, as for instance Wessén, Wenskus, Hoffman etc., have argued that this tale might be a reminiscence of the migration of the Goths.

Certain linguists, as for instance Elias Wessén, point out that there are similarities between Gothic and Gutnish that are not found elsewhere in the Germanic languages. One example is the use of the word &quot;lamb&quot; for both young and adult sheep, which is only seen in Gutnish and Gothic.
Before the 7th century, the Gutes made a trade and defence agreement with Swedish kings, according to the Gutasaga. This seems to have been due to Swedish military aggression. Although the Gutes were victorious in these battles, they eventually found it more beneficial (as a nation of traders) to try to negotiate a peace treaty with the Swedes.
It gives Awair Strabain as the man who arranged the mutually beneficial agreement with the king of Sweden and the event would have taken place before the end of the ninth century, when Wulfstan of Hedeby reported that the island was subject to the Swedes.

Because of Gotland&#x27;s central position in the Baltic Sea, from early on the Gutes became a nation of traders and merchants. The amount of silver treasure that has been found in Gotlandic soil during the Viking Age surpasses that of all the other Swedish provinces counted together, which tells of a traders&#x27; nation of indisputable rank among the North Germanic tribes. The Gutes were the leading tradesmen in the Baltic sea until the rise of the Hanseatic League.

The Gutes were both yeomen farmers and traveling merchants at the same time: so-called &quot;farmenn&quot;. This was an exceptionally dangerous occupation during the Middle Ages, since the Baltic Sea was full of pirates. The Gutnish &quot;farmenn&quot; always had to be ready for battle. The division and organisation of the early Gutnish society shows a nation constantly ready for war. The &quot;ram&quot; seems to have been an early symbol for the Gutes, and is still seen on the Gotlandic coat of arms.

==Sources==
The history of Gotland can be read in the book &quot;Gutasaga&quot;. The &quot;Gutasaga&quot; is a saga treating the history of Gotland prior to Christianity. It was recorded in the 13th century and survives in only a single manuscript, the &quot;Codex Holm B. 64&quot;, dating to ca. 1350. It is kept in the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm together with the &quot;Gutalagen&quot;, the legal code of Gotland. It was written in the Old Gutnish dialect of Old Norse.

<text>The Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies was a junior Ministerial post in the United Kingdom government, subordinate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and, from 1948, also to a Minister of State.

==Under-Secretaries of State for the Colonies, 1768–1782==

In 1782, following the loss of the American colonies, the office was abolished, and its duties given to the Home Secretary. From there it passed to the War Office, which was later renamed the War and Colonial Office. In 1854 this office was split, and the Colonial Office reestablished.

<text>Bow Church is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Bow, London, England. It is between Devons Road and Pudding Mill Lane stations. It is interlinked by an out of station interchange (OSI) within walking distance via Bow Road with Bow Road station on London Underground&#x27;s District and Hammersmith and City lines. The two Bow stations are classed as a single station for ticketing purposes as well as on tube maps but both managed separately. Opened with the original system on 31 August 1987, the station takes its name from the nearby 14th century Bow Church, which is a Church of England church.

There is a crossover south of the station which allows trains from Stratford and Poplar to reverse here. One example of this is when the new platforms at Stratford were being constructed – trains were suspended between Bow Church and Stratford and trains from Poplar terminated here. The station is accessible via lifts to both platforms and it has ticket machines and Oyster pads.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Bow Church is:
* 12 tph to 
* 12 tph to Canary Wharf

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 16 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours extended beyond Canary Wharf to and from .


==Connections==
Five London Buses routes serve this station: 25, 108, 205, 425, N25 and N205. Additionally 108 have a 24-hour service. Also routes 8, 276, 488 and the &quot;D&quot; prefix route D8 (towards Poplar only) serve the station indirectly by Bow Church.

<doc id="1290490" wikidata="Q4659028" url="?curid=1290490" title="A Prison Diary">
<text>A Prison Diary is a series of three books of diaries written by Jeffrey Archer during his time in prisons following his convictions for perjury and perverting the course of justice.

Each volume is named after a part of Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. The volumes become progressively longer due to his stay being longer and longer at each prison in which he was confined.

==Volume 1: &quot;Belmarsh: Hell&quot;==

This book, written under the nom de plume &quot;FF 8282&quot;, documents Archer&#x27;s introduction to the prison system. He was to spend the first 22 days and 14 hours in HMP Belmarsh, a double A-Category high-security prison in South London. Although Archer spent less than a month there, Belmarsh is described as a real hell-hole. Despite this, many of the inmates are extremely kind to him and regale him with anecdotes, which he duly records.
One such prisoner apparently spoken of is the inspiration to one of his short stories from &quot;Cat O&#x27;Nine Tales&quot;, &quot;It Can&#x27;t Be October Already&quot;.
On the other hand, some of the information Archer learns in his three weeks at Belmarsh is extremely disturbing, and he makes great play of imagining that the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, ought to be reading it and asks for his attention. One theme is the fact that some inmates are thrown into cells for first time offences even though the cellmate is a hardened criminal or murderer and/or drug addict. Further, it seems there are more heroin addicts coming out of prison than going in. This is because of both random and compulsory checks in which the inmates have discovered cannabis does not leave the system any time soon, but heroin is flushed out of the body in 24 hours providing large quantities of water have been consumed. They want a drug and this is the one they can obtain.
Other inmates he talked with include an experienced Listener (for the Samaritans), who had been sexually abused through much of his childhood, existing as a sex-slave, and only knew crime. The very people set up by the institutions to protect him like social workers and magistrates, judges and policemen, let him down, and also paid to abuse him. He also describes how an inmate who professed to love his books casually offered to arrange for the witness whose testimony was the main factor in Archer&#x27;s conviction to be murdered in revenge. Archer learned this man was serving two life sentences for murdering a man he&#x27;d caught his wife in bed with, before raping and murdering her afterward. He comes away from the encounter very disturbed.

==Volume 2: &quot;Wayland: Purgatory&quot;==
Published: 2003

This book is much longer than the previous one and charts Archer&#x27;s time in HMP Wayland, a C-Category prison near Thetford in Norfolk. The rules are more relaxed, but as the title suggests, boredom is the main enemy for all prisoners, not just Archer. He charts each day in varying levels of detail depending on whether anything of interest happens. His friends and family remain constantly faithful and carry on his appeal case while he is incarcerated. It was here that he apparently encountered another character inspiring a short story in Cat O&#x27;Nine Tales, &quot;Maestro&quot;. Archer interacted more in this prison with those inmates who could obtain for him goods and services not formally permitted by the authorities, like extra BT phone-cards. He emphasizes how ineffective prison bureaucracy is, especially how the hierarchy works or rather does not work, for example a number of personnel each claiming to be governor.

==Volume 3: &quot;North Sea Camp: Heaven&quot;==
Published: 2004

This details his time in North Sea Camp near Boston, Lincolnshire a D-category open prison. More privileges, a more relaxed regime and of course, more anecdotes from his time in prison. Archer spent almost a year in this prison and some weeks, once eligible, working in the local theatre. A minor breach of conditions during a home visit resulted in Archer being sent to B-Category HMP Lincoln for 22 days, described in a section of the book subtitled &quot;Back to Hell&quot;. An investigation reversed the decision and he finished his sentence inside D-category HMP Hollesley Bay without opportunity for outside work, summarised in an epilogue.

<doc id="1290491" wikidata="Q1391778" url="?curid=1290491" title="PA Consulting Group">
<text>PA Consulting Group (formerly Personnel Administration) is a professional services firm that works with public, private and third-sector organisations. It was founded in 1943 by Ernest E. Butten, Tom H. Kirkham and Dr David Seymour, who used a new approach to people management to increase productivity in munitions factories during World War 2. PA grew to become the world’s largest management consultancy by headcount in 1970.

Today, PA employs more than 4,000 people globally.

PA works with organisations in seven industries: consumer and manufacturing; defence and security; energy and utilities; financial services; public services; healthcare and life sciences; and transport. It operates in these industries from offices in the UK, US, Ireland, Nordics and Netherlands. It is also a member of the United Nations Global Compact, a non-binding UN pact that encourages businesses to adopt sustainable practices, and the WePROTECT Global Alliance, a network of governments and companies aiming to tackle online child exploitation and abuse. PA produced the first two Global Threat Assessments for WePROTECT.

The company is privately held, with 65% of shares owned by Jacobs Solutions and the remaining 35% owned by current and former employees. Staff can buy shares during an annual share-trading period.

==History==

===1940–1950===
PA was founded in 1943 as Personnel Administration by Ernest E. Butten, Tom H. Kirkham and Dr David Seymour. Britain&#x27;s war effort created great demand for munitions and goods, which had to be produced by a relatively unskilled workforce. Butten and his colleagues formed Personnel Administration Limited to provide advice to industry as to how to improve the productivity of their workers.
PA was an offshoot of the pre-war Bedaux Company. Bedaux in turn had been developed based on the &#x27;scientific management&#x27; theories of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Frank Gilbreth. Butten sought to take the mechanistic and task-orientated concepts of scientific management and add a human dimension to them. The chief idea, along the lines of Douglas McGregor&#x27;s &#x27;Theory Y&#x27;, was that by involving the worker in the process of change and a suitable form of ownership, greater gains could be made both by the worker and the organisation.

PA&#x27;s first assignment was to train volunteer women to assemble the tail gun section of Avro Lancaster bombers, as part of Britain&#x27;s policy of bringing women into the factories to free up male workers for the armed forces.

===1950–1970===

By 1964, PA had dropped the name Personnel Administration and was known as simply PA Consulting Group. PA expanded and, by 1970, was the world’s largest management consulting firm by headcount. PA had also expanded geographically, mostly along the lines of the Commonwealth, with its operations in Australia providing about a third of the firm&#x27;s revenue.

Butten retired from PA in 1970, having earlier sold his 100% shareholding in PA to the Butten Trust in 1958. The Trust was intended as a long-term guardian of PA&#x27;s fortunes and an assurance that the company would be &#x27;owned by the employees&#x27;.

===1970–1992===

During this period, PA found success in advising companies on potential applications of technology to business issues. This led to them building technology centres in Melbourn, UK, and Princeton, USA.

Towards the end of the &#x27;80s, PA&#x27;s management took the firm public. The Butten Trust, after an application to the courts in the UK, agreed to give 15% of its shares to its employees. However, the company changed its strategy after 1992 to one of staff ownership.

===1992–2015===

Between 1991 and 1994, PA reduced its workforce by almost half. In 1992, Jon Moynihan was appointed as chief executive of PA.

Jeremy Asher became group CEO in 1998. The firm acquired Hagler Bailly Inc. in 2000 for around $96 million in cash.

Government figures released in 2010 showed that PA was the second largest beneficiary of UK Government contracts to consulting firms, receiving £11million over the first year of the coalition. It has gained publicity for its work on analysing what it has called the zombie economy. Other work includes its annual survey of opinion in higher education, and ongoing technological innovations, including a new type of round kitchen towel.

On 31 December 2013, Jon Moynihan retired as executive chairman, and was replaced by Marcus Agius, the former chairman of Barclays Bank. In March 2014 the company launched a new logo (the third in its history), a new visual identity and redesigned website. Also in March 2014, Health Select Committee member Sarah Wollaston MP questioned PA Consulting&#x27;s uploading of a pseudonymised extract of Hospital Episode Statistics to Google BigQuery. The Health and Social Care Information Centre confirmed that PA had used the data in accordance with the information sharing agreement in place.

===2015–present===

In 2015, The Carlyle Group bought a majority stake in the company, giving it a value of US$1 billion.

In October 2017, PA relocated its global corporate headquarters.

In April 2018, PA&#x27;s chairman, Marcus Agius, announced he would step down and assume the role of deputy chairman, with John Alexander replacing him. Alexander made the move from environmental and sustainability consultancy ERM, where he took the company through two rounds of private equity funding. In December 2018, PA announced it was appointing a new head of its Americas business, Ken Toombs. The group announced Ken Toombs as CEO in October 2020, following on from Alan Middleton who stepped down after 13 years as CEO of the consultancy.

In November 2020, PA’s board announced its recommendation to accept a proposal by Jacobs Solutions to acquire a 65% stake in PA. Following a vote by PA shareholders and UK Court approval, the deal was finalised on 2 March 2021, valuing PA at £1.825 billion.

In 2021, John Cala joined PA&#x27;s business in the Americas.
In 2022, PA appointed a new chief financial officer and chief information officer, and created new roles for a chief research officer, head of alliances, platforms and products, and head of markets.
Chartered Accountant Will Lambe joined as CFO, moving from KPMG, while Kelly Olsen joined as CIO.
Charlene Li, co-author of Groundswell and founder of Altimeter, became chief research officer. Rina Ladva joined the firm as head of alliances, platforms and products, making the move from Microsoft. And Tracey Countryman took on the role of Head of Markets, joining PA from Accenture.

In 2023, Christian Norris was named as CEO.

== Technology and innovation ==
PA has a strong focus on technology dating back to its work with the earliest computers in the 1950s. Its Global Innovation and Technology Centre, designed by Richard Rogers and founded by Professor Gordon Edge in 1970, helped create the Cambridge Phenomenon where the city became a centre for the UK’s technological companies.

Innovations developed at the centre over the past 50 years include: the original brushless servo motor; medical injectors that mean the patient does not need to see the needle; a self-monitoring device for people with diabetes that measures blood glucose levels; micrometers; and 4G wireless test equipment. During the Iraq War, PA developed the &quot;Panama System&quot; to protect UK troops from improvised explosive devices, winning the Management Consultancies Association&#x27;s top prize for innovation.

More recently, the Centre designed a prototype electric vehicle charging point that aims to be “as recognisable as the red post box or black cab” with the Royal College of Art for the UK Government; developed the manufacturing equipment needed to mass produce edible water bottles for Notpla; and helped build the world’s biggest battery in California with Vistra Energy.

=== PA ventures ===

PA&#x27;s venture programme (PA Group Ventures) was established in 2000.

Ventures include a third-generation mobile phone business called UbiNetics that was sold for a total of $133 million in 2005; and Meridica – a drug delivery system company – that was sold to Pfizer for $125 million in 2004. PA demerged its venture arm, Ipex Capital, in June 2008.

Other recent ventures include:

Exacsys, which develops solutions to improve Point of Care (PoC) diagnostic systems. One application of this technology is the self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to help people manage their diabetes.

ProcServe, which provides a cloud-based procurement system. The ProcServe Trading Network covers more than 17,000 organisations and is used by central government, and the National Police Procurement Hub, as well as commercial sector customers including Orange and Xerox.

Argenti, a business that innovates telecare technology in partnership with local councils in the UK to improve adult social care.

<text>Hugo Heyrman (born 20 December 1942), known by his artist name Dr. Hugo Heyrman, is a leading Belgian painter, filmmaker, internet pioneer, synesthesia and new media researcher.

== Early life and education ==
Dr. Hugo Heyrman was born in Zwijndrecht, he lives and works in Antwerp. Originally, Heyrman opted for a musical education, but transferred to the visual arts. He graduated from the Royal Academy and became a laureate of the National Higher Institute for Fine Arts in Antwerp. In addition, he studied nuclear physics during one year at the State Higher Institute for Nuclear Energy in Mol. He received a Ph.D. in art sciences, magna cum laude, from the Universidad de La Laguna, in Tenerife with a thesis on &quot;Art &amp; Computers: an exploratory investigation on the digital transformation of art&quot;.

==Career==
From his earliest work, Heyrman developed a specific vision on the nature of perception. &quot;Most of my work has to do with contemporary fragility. The works are &#x27;ways of seeing&#x27;, forms of visual thinking, they make the virtual and mental space of an image real&quot;, he declares in his website. His art practice includes painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, film and digital media. In his website &#x27;Museums of the Mind&#x27; he continues to publish his research, theory and experiments on the telematic future of art, the senses and synaesthesia.

During the sixties, Heyrman profiled himself as an avant-garde artist with happenings, film- and video experiments. Online since 1995, Heyrman became one of the pioneers in Net.art. He also participated in 1988 at the &#x27;First International Symposium on Electronic Art&#x27; (FISEA) in Utrecht.

In 1995, Heyrman coined the terms &quot;tele-synaesthesia&quot; and &quot;post-ego&quot;. Since 1993 he is a working member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts, Brussels. As of 2006 he was a professor at the Royal Academy for Fine Arts, Antwerp.

<text>John Edward Bruce, also known as Bruce Grit or J. E. Bruce-Grit (February 22, 1856 – August 7, 1924), was an American journalist, historian, writer, orator, civil rights activist and Pan-African nationalist. He was born a slave in Maryland; as an adult, he founded numerous newspapers along the East Coast, as well as co-founding (with Arthur Alfonso Schomburg) the Negro Society for Historical Research in New York.

==Early life and education==
Bruce was born in 1856 in Piscataway, Maryland, to enslaved parents Robert and Martha Allen (Clark) Bruce. When he was three years old, his father was sold to a slaveholder in Georgia and Bruce never saw or heard from him again. He and his mother fled to Washington, D.C. and later to Connecticut, where Bruce enrolled in an integrated school and received his first formal education. Traveling back to Washington later, he received a private education and attended Howard University for a three-month course. After that, he never pursued formal education again, and was mostly self-taught.

In 1874, at the age of 18, Bruce earned a job as a messenger for the associate editor of the New York Times&#x27; Washington office. His duties included getting information for the next day&#x27;s paper from Senator Charles Sumner, a Republican who supported civil rights for African-Americans.

==Career==
In Washington, DC, in 1879, Bruce and Charles N. Otley founded the &quot;Argus Weekly&quot; newspaper. They decided that the paper would &quot;be a fearless advocate of the true principles of the Republican Party, and the moral and intellectual advancement of the Negro American.&quot; It was a time of flourishing projects in the black community.

Next, Bruce founded the &quot;Sunday Item&quot; in 1880, and the &quot;Republican&quot; in 1882, both in Norfolk, Virginia. He served as the associate editor and business manager of the Baltimore, Maryland, &quot;Commonwealth&quot; in 1884.

Later that year, he returned to Washington, D.C. to establish the &quot;Grit&quot;. He earned income as a paid contributor to &quot;The Boston Transcript&quot;, &quot;The Albany Argus&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Express&quot;, &quot;Sunday Gazette&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Republic&quot; of Washington under his pen name of &quot;Bruce Grit&quot;.

Bruce also became prominent on the lecture circuit, giving speeches that addressed lynching, the condition of southern blacks, and the weak American political system that failed to protect the rights of its black citizens. In 1890, he joined activist T. Thomas Fortune&#x27;s Afro-American League, the first organized black civil rights group in the nation. He became the organization&#x27;s new president in 1898 when it reformed as the Afro-American Council.

Bruce was a member of the literary bureau of the Republican National Committee in 1900.

By 1908, he had followed the Great Migration to New York. There, in 1908, he established the Yonkers, New York, &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;. Beginning in 1910, he served as American Correspondent for the &quot;African Times and Orient Review&quot; of London, England, edited by Dusé Mohamed Ali. In Yonkers, he also worked as a probation officer in 1910.

==Position on armed self-defense==
During the American Reconstruction era and after, many black leaders espoused non-violent strategies for social change. Appalled at the rise of lynchings and imposition of legal segregation, Bruce supported armed self-defense against racist attacks. He is quoted as saying: &quot;The Man who will not fight for the protection of his wife and children...is a coward and deserves to be ill treated. The man who takes his life in his hand and stands up for what he knows to be right will always command the respect of his enemy.&quot; He supported &quot;organized resistance to organized resistance.&quot;

==Later career==
In Harlem and Yonkers, Bruce became involved with the emerging community of intellectuals, including newly arrived immigrants from the Caribbean. In 1911, with Arthur Schomburg from Puerto Rico, he founded the Negro Society for Historical Research, first based in Yonkers, to create an institute to support scholarly efforts. For the first time it brought together African, West Indian and Afro-American scholars. This later became the foundation for the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library, on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem.

Bruce also was a mentor to Hubert Henry Harrison, the young migrant from St. Croix who became influential in black socialism and black nationalism.

Bruce&#x27;s belief in an independent national destiny for blacks in the United States led him in the period around 1919 to embrace Jamaican Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Pan-African nationalism. As a member of Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), Bruce wrote for the movement&#x27;s &quot;Negro World&quot; and the &quot;Daily Negro Times&quot;.

Despite his productivity, Bruce found that to sustain himself he had for most of his adult life to work for the Port of New York Authority. After he retired in 1922, he received a small pension until his death in New York City&#x27;s Bellevue Hospital two years later.

Bruce was given an impressive state funeral at the UNIA Liberty Hall in New York City on August 10, 1924, and was buried in Oakland Cemetery in Yonkers. More than 5,000 people attended three services conducted that day honoring him.

Bruce was a Prince Hall Mason, member of the Humane Order of African Redemption and the African Society of London, now the Royal African Society.

==Marriage and family==
Bruce married Florence A. Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio, on September 10, 1885, in Washington, DC.

<text>The University of San Agustin – Iloilo, also known as UniSAg or San Ag, is a private Roman Catholic institution in Iloilo City, Philippines. It is operated by the Augustinian Province of Santo Niño de Cebu, Philippines, belonging to the Order of Saint Augustine. Founded in July 1904, it started as a school for boys with 40 students. In 1917, it became Colegio de San Agustin and later achieved university status in March 1953, becoming the first university in Western Visayas and the first Augustinian university in the Asia-Pacific region.

The University of San Agustin offers a wide range of academic programs, starting from Basic Education up to post-graduate studies. These programs cover various fields such as Law, Business, Education, Computer Studies, Arts and Sciences, Performing Arts, Music, Engineering, Medical Technology, Nursing, and Pharmacy. In 2013, the university celebrated its 60th year as an institution of higher learning. It is recognized as a Center of Development in Teacher Education by the Commission on Higher Education.

==History==

===Founding===

The Spanish Augustinians were the first Christian missionaries of any religious order to enter the Philippines and begin its conversion to Catholicism. Later after the revolution, Spanish Augustinian friars were removed from 194 parishes and left the Philippines in 1899, eventually turning over their churches and mission stations to secular clergy. The Order retained only a few parishes, including their main foundations in Cebu, Manila, and Iloilo, with American friars taking over them.

On 15 July 1904, American members of the order along with Filipino friars belonging to the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines, founded the university and established it with assistance from their confreres from the Augustinian U.S. Province of St. Thomas of Villanova. It began as a preparatory school for boys during the American colonial period. On 12 December 1912, it was granted government recognition for its various course offerings. Later on 5 February 1917, it was formally incorporated under the name Colegio de San Agustín de Iloilo. In 1928, one of the country&#x27;s oldest campus publications, &quot;The Augustinian Mirror&quot;, was established, producing some of the country&#x27;s well-known writers. The 1930s saw rapid growth with the opening of three colleges in quick succession: College of Liberal Arts in 1935, College of Commerce in 1936 and College of Law in 1937. In 1940, the college began admitting female students.

During the Second World War (1941–45), the college was temporarily closed as the Philippines fought a guerrilla war against the Japanese. The war led to the destruction of all the buildings, except for Urdaneta Hall, which at present houses the university theatre and the College of Pharmacy and Medical Technology. With almost the entire college in ruins, some friars advocated closing the school altogether while others pushed for its immediate rehabilitation. American Augustinians came on loan after the War to help the Order run the University of San Agustin for a couple of years while young friars from Spain of the Philippine Province were studying their master&#x27;s degrees and learning English in the United States or Australia.

It was eventually reopened in 1945, followed by a decade of expansion that ushered in both the College of Pharmacy and the College of Technology (1945), the Normal (Teacher&#x27;s) College (1947), the Graduate School (1950), and the College of Dentistry (1953). The school was granted university status on 1 March 1953, a year before its 50th anniversary, making it the first university in Western Visayas.

The following year, the Rev. Angel Dulanto, OSA arrived from Spain after completing his studies at Villanova University, an American sister school of San Agustin. As an impresario, he introduced the yearly velada, characterized by a weeklong festivity of artistic, religious, and cultural events. A zarzuela, staged by both professors and students, is the centerpiece of University Week from 14 to 20 February.

In 1965, the Rev. Nicanor Lana, OSA became rector of the university. His term was marked by vast improvements in the school&#x27;s infrastructure. The same year he started his term as rector, he inaugurated DySA, the official radio station of the university, to help expand the reach of the university through mass media. The University of San Agustín Press, known today as Libro Agustino, came a year later. In the months leading to the centenary of San Agustín in 2004, it began publishing book titles by Augustinian authors, with an eye at producing a total of 100 different volumes over several years.

Poor enrollment forced the administrators to phase out the College of Dentistry in 1967. But a flowering of cultural and artistic activities on campus led to the founding of the famous Kawilihan-USA Dance Troupe, the USA Troubadours, and the Conservatory of Music. The Rev. Santiago Ezcurra, OSA, a Spanish musician who studied music in Rome, was formally installed as its first dean. In 1969 the USA Clinical Laboratory was opened, followed a few years later by the introduction of the College of Nursing in 1974. In 2010, the university announced the establishment of a new extension campus in Mati, Davao Oriental, Philippines.

===1984 to present===
The university maintains a Level III accreditation status granted by the PAASCU and is one of the two schools in the region having an autonomous status granted by CHED in early 2000. The university&#x27;s campus, situated in the very heart of the city on General Luna Street, has a modern gymnasium, an auditorium, various conferences and seminar rooms, science, computer and speech laboratories, a museum, a bookstore, a library, an instructional media center, an Olympic size swimming pool and tennis and badminton courts.

In 1984 the all-Filipino Augustinian Province of Santo Niño of Cebu was formed, separating from the mother Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines based in Madrid, and ownership of the university was handed over to the latest circumscription of the Augustinian Order. A succession of rectors were appointed, including Bernardino Ricafrente, Eusebio Berdon, Mamerto Alfeche, and Rodolfo Arreza. During Arreza&#x27;s term, he pursued linkages with various universities abroad and focused on research development.

San Agustín promotes literature in the region through the Fray Luis de Léon Creative Writing Institute, sponsor of the annual national writers workshop of the same name. The workshop awards a number of writing fellowships to writers in English, Hiligaynon, and other Philippine languages. Its official student publication, The Augustinian Mirror, has won various journalism awards and has produced some of the Philippines&#x27; highly respected literary minds, notably Augustinian poet Gilbert Luis R. Centina III, OSA.

Recent developments in 1980s to early 2000s of the university include the establishment of various research and communication centers, namely: The Institute for Augustinian Studies, Villanova Institute for Social Science Research and Cultural Studies, Mendel Institute for Natural Science and Technology Research, and Institute for Social Development Issues and Initiatives.

Over the years, school enrollment has increased, resulting in the decision to move the high school department to a new campus in the suburbs of Sambag, Jaro in June 1995.

In contrast to the Philippine government&#x27;s implementation of the K+12 basic education program, which adds an additional two years of senior high education after a student graduates from high school, the university has reorganized and merged its tertiary schools and colleges. The College of Nursing and the College of Pharmacy and Medical Technology merged to become the College of Health and Allied Medical Professions (CHAMP). The College of Architecture and Design and the College of Engineering merged to form the College of Technology (COT). The College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education merged into the College of Liberal Arts, Sciences, and Education (CLASE). Meanwhile, the College of Law maintained its structure, and the College of Business Administration and Accountancy was renamed the College of Commerce.

== University Rectors and Presidents ==
==Research and extension==
Concurrent to the academic undertakings of the faculty and students, as a small-size research university, the University of San Agustin has adequate research centers each with their own focus of scientific and fields of studies. Several of such said centers were established in consortium with Philippine government agencies like the Department of Science and Technology (Philippines).

* USA Institute for Augustinian Studies
* USA Villanova Institute for Social Science Research and Cultural Studies
* USA Mendel Institute for Natural Science and Technology Research
* USA Institute for Social Development Issues and Initiatives
* USA Center for Informatics (CFI)

==Cultures and traditions==

===Patron Saint===
The university is named in honor of fourth century saint Augustine of Hippo, a key figure in the doctrinal development of Western Christianity and a Doctor of the Church. Two of his surviving works, &quot;The Confessions&quot; (his autobiography) and &quot;The City of God,&quot; are regarded as Western classics. Augustine is often considered to be one of the theological fountainheads of the Reformation because of his teaching on salvation and grace. Martin Luther, perhaps the greatest figure of the Reformation, was himself an Augustinian friar.

Other English speaking Augustinian Schools with the same patron saint include Colegio San Agustin-Makati, Colegio del Santo Niño (Cebu), Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod, Colegio San Agustin-Biñan, St. Augustine&#x27;s College, Brookvale in Sydney, Australia, St. Augustine College Preparatory School, Richland, New Jersey; St. Augustine High School, San Diego, California; and Agustin Preparatory School in Reading, Massachusetts – all three in the United States; and St Augustine College in Malta.

===Core Augustinian Values===
* CARITAS (Charity)
* UNITAS (Unity)
* VERITAS (Truth)

===Kasanag sa Paskwa===
&quot;Kasanag&quot; (KaSANAG), a portmanteau of words &quot;Ka&quot; and &quot;SanAg&quot; (a colloquial of San Agustin), which also means bright or light in Hiligaynon language, and &quot;sa&quot; &quot;Paskwa&quot; (Hiligaynon translation of Christmas), which if combined is translated as &quot;Light in Christmas&quot; in English language, is a yuletide festival of lights which happens every December on the main campus of University San Agustin. The said holiday event include carnival rides fair, musical plays, Christmas variety shows and singing contests and concerts held by the university&#x27;s schools and colleges. A fireworks display and traditional switching on of Christmas lights are showcased on its opening night.

==Publications==
===The Augustinian Mirror===

The Augustinian Mirror is the official student magazine of the University of San Agustin. It was also adopted as the official name of the student publication of the elementary department of Colegio San Agustin-Makati (founded 1969), a sister school of the University of San Agustin in the nation&#x27;s metropolitan capital region.

It is published twice a year (once every semester) by the USA Publications. Founded in 1928, it is one of the country&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious campus magazines. Among its chief goals are to nurture young literary minds and social achievers in the fields of literature, journalism, philosophy, theology, law and governance. The plan to establish a school publication was initiated in 1927. Although it was officially founded in 1928, the maiden issue first came out in 1929. It started as a news-oriented tabloid that covered annual events and activities of the university in English and Spanish. Being one of the earliest post-colonial Catholic publications in the Philippines, it was exhibited in the exposition of the Catholic Press at the Vatican in 1936. During World War II, it ceased operation as school authorities decided to close the university at a time of great uncertainty.

The post-war volume of 1945 saw the gradual change to its present format as a news magazine complemented with works of fiction, column writing and poetry in four subdivided sections: English, Filipino, Hiligaynon and Spanish. In 1946, the publication gained its first female editor. A complementary newspaper, &quot;The Augustinian,&quot; was established in 1954 focusing on news events in the university. It became a vehicle for students and faculty members to express their opinions on campus and socio-political issues. In 2006, a literary journal, &quot;Irong-Irong,&quot; was launched as a student medium for creative writing.

Over the years, The Augustinian Mirror has evolved into a theme-oriented publication. It has won countless awards and distinctions for excellence in news writing, human rights, tourism and travel in the past decades. It is a three-time recipient of the &quot;Gawad Lopez Jaena Award&quot; for &quot;excellence in campus journalism,&quot; the highest distinction given by the government-run Philippine Information Agency (PIA). It has also won nine times the distinction of being adjudged the &quot;best college magazine&quot; in Western Visayas by COPRE (College Press Conference) and has been cited by the National Collegiate Press as one of the three best campus magazines of the Philippines in the 1970s. It has produced outstanding writers who later went on to become recipients of the Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature. After numerous journalism awards for nineteen consecutive years, it was granted in 2006 the right to hand out its own awards known as the SanAg Campus Press Awards.

<doc id="1290501" wikidata="Q5978034" url="?curid=1290501" title="Messer Street Grounds">
<text>Messer Street Grounds, also known as Messer Park or Messer Field, was a former baseball park located in Providence, Rhode Island. It was home to the Providence Grays of the National League from 1878 to 1885 and of the minor league Providence Grays of the Eastern League in 1886. 

In 1878, the Providence Base Ball Association formed and began scouting around the city for a good location for &quot;the best baseball plant in the country.&quot; Team directors visited the old Josiah Chapin farm on city&#x27;s west side and decided that it fit all of the requirements for a baseball park. It was close to level, it was raised up a few feet from the surrounding roads, and it was easily accessible by street car. 

Construction on Messer Park began on April 1 and took exactly one month to complete; the final nail was hammered a mere five minutes before the opening game got underway on May 1.

==Ballpark Description==

The new ballpark opened to the public on May 1, 1878. The following account from the Providence Morning Star captures the excitement and provides a very detailed description of the park:

&quot;The large grandstand held twelve hundred people, among them hundreds of ladies. The long semi-circular tiers of seats were black with men and boys, and hundreds were standing, unable to get seats. The commodious space for carriages was completely filled, and one or two May Day riding parties also graced that part of the grounds...Two registering turnstiles gates admit the patrons to the grounds, and as each ticket holder passes through the gate he steps on a raised platform, and by a mechanical arrangement is registered, and only one person can pass through the gate at a time. Near the gate are two ticket offices, and a large entrance through which the crowd can pass at the end of the game. At the southeast corner there is a large gate to admit carriages to the park. The ground, which contains nearly six acres of land, is enclosed by a fence twelve feet high. The diamond is as level as constant rolling by heavy stone and iron rollers can make it. Inside of the base lines is turfed, except a space nine feet in width, reaching from the pitcher&#x27;s position to the home plate. Twenty-two feet are sodded outside of the diamond. Paths leading to and from the bases have been rolled hard, and the out-field is sown with grass seed. The grand stand which will seat nearly 1200 people, is 151 x , and in the rear is raised . The stand is reached by steps at both ends. It will be covered by canvass, requiring nearly . Seats are arranged in a circle at the eastern and western sides of the field. A platform 60 x has been erected for the reporters, scorers and invited guests, seating nearly 60 persons. Under the grand stand for the visiting and local clubs are rooms square and fitted up with wardrobes, dressing rooms square, a wash room supplied with Pawtucket water, closet, etc. The Western Union Telegraph Company have a room 8 x . There is a stockholders&#x27; room square, and a refreshment saloon 40 x 20 to be managed by caterer Ardoene. A fence with gateways has been erected in front of the club rooms, thereby preventing the crowd from having any talk with the players. The grounds are without doubt as fine as any in the country, and Harry Wright said yesterday, &#x27;They are beautiful.&quot;

The left field fence was apparently quite close to home plate. One reporter complained that &quot;a hit made in Providence near that foul line post is not a long hit; in fact that same hit in the right field seldom gives more than one base.&quot; Despite the allegedly short fence, the Messer Street Grounds was not a friendly home run park. Only eight home runs were hit there in National League games all year long, compared to about two hundred at Chicago&#x27;s tiny park. Those eight included four over the left field fence, an inside-the-park home run by Paul Hines, and one smash by Jerry Denny that landed in the carriage driveway in right-center field, which was called &quot;the longest ever made upon the grounds.&quot; Just beyond the short left field lay a building where fans could sit on the roof and watch the game for the discounted rate of 25 cents, probably to the chagrin of the team management. One particularly powerful home run by Jerry Denny &quot;sailed away like a hawk, rising and rising until long after it passed the left field fence, and until it was far above the housetops, finally dropping in a garden near the street.&quot;

The Grays were the first professional team to install a backstop in their park. The screens were installed in 1878 along the grandstand section directly behind the catcher, an area known as the &quot;slaughter pens&quot; for all the foul ball injuries that occurred there.

Before the 1884 season, a few minor improvements on the park were made. The reporters&#x27; area of the grand stand was supplied with comfortable cushions by former team president Flint, which all of the reporters noted with gratitude. A score slate was also placed in left field to show the Boston scores by inning as they came in over the telegraph. Finally, &quot;some elaborate pictures have been obtained by Director Allen, measuring 7 x , giving a life-size illustration of the diamond and a game in progress, which will be displayed on prominent boards on schedule days.&quot;

==The End of Messer Street Grounds==

The park housed the minor league Providence Grays of the Eastern League in 1886, but the park was too large for the pitiful attendance that the team drew, and by early June the park was once again empty. Rumors began circulating about the sale of the park in September 1886. On February 16, 1887, trustee Greene finally sold off the property that the Messer Street Grounds sat on, in a deed to the Franklin Institute for Savings. The exact demolition date of the park is unknown, but must have been at some point during the next few months. By the end of the year, the subdivided plots were selling off at a rapid clip, and houses started to spring up where the old ball park used to stand.

<text>Salvadori&#x27;s teal (Salvadorina waigiuensis) or Salvadori&#x27;s duck, is a species of bird endemic to New Guinea. It is placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Salvadorina&quot;.

It has a dark-brown head and neck, and its body is barred and spotted dark-brown and off white, with orange legs and a yellow bill.

It is a secretive inhabitant of fast-flowing highland streams and lakes. It is an omnivore. It locates its nest near water, and lays two to four eggs in the dry season. The IUCN has listed the bird as least concern, and the total population may be slowly declining.

==Taxonomy==
When Walter Rothschild and Ernst Hartert first described Salvadori&#x27;s teal in 1894, they placed it in the concurrently created monotypic genus &quot;Salvadorina&quot;. It has no subspecies. Initially, it was generally placed with South America&#x27;s torrent duck and New Zealand&#x27;s blue duck—two species of similar ecological niches—in a tribe called Merganettini. In the 1940s, Ernst Mayr moved the species to the dabbling duck genus &quot;Anas&quot;, based on several anatomical features. 

The duck&#x27;s common and genus names both commemorate 18th-century Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori. The species name &quot;waigiuensis&quot; refers to Waigeo (also known as Waigiu), an island near New Guinea.

==Description==
Measuring in length, with a wingspan of , and a mass of , Salvadori&#x27;s teal is a small duck. The sexes are similar in plumage, with males averaging slightly larger than females.

==Range and habitat==
Salvadori&#x27;s teal is endemic to New Guinea; although the type specimen was reportedly collected on the Indonesian island of Waigeo, there is some doubt over the veracity of that claim, as the species is not now found there. Resident at elevations ranging from , Salvadori&#x27;s teal prefers swiftly flowing rivers and streams, though it is also occasionally found in stagnant lakes.

==Behavior==
===Food and feeding===
Salvadori&#x27;s teal is an omnivore, and feeds by both dabbling and diving. It eats plants and insects, and possibly small fish.

===Breeding===
It locates its nest near water, and lays two to four eggs in the dry season.

==Conservation and threats==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed Salvadori&#x27;s teal as least concern. The total world population, currently estimated to be between 2,500 and 9,999 mature individuals, is thought to be declining at a moderate rate. Hunting, habitat degradation and predation by dogs are among the threats this species faces, and competition with introduced sport fish may also cause problems.

<text>The Helios 2 system, which consists of the Helios 2A and Helios 2B, is a French-developed military Earth observation satellite program. Financed at 90% by France, the development also involved minor participation from Belgium, Spain, Italy and Greece. Helios 2A was launched on 18 December 2004 by an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana.

Helios 2B was launched five years later, on 18 December 2009, carried also by an Ariane 5. The two satellites are identical. They carry a Thales-built high-resolution visible and thermal infrared instrument with 35 cm resolution, and an Airbus-built medium-resolution instrument. The Helios 2 satellite bus is nearly identical to the platform built by EADS Astrium for the Spot 5 civil-commercial optical observation satellite.

The Helios 2 will be replaced by the Composante Spatiale Optique (CSO), a new French program of three military observation satellites. The first satellite (CSO-1) was launched on 15 December 2018, the second (CSO-2) on 29 December 2020, with the final launch (CSO-3) being scheduled for 2024.

<doc id="1290518" wikidata="Q1530960" url="?curid=1290518" title="Gleneagles Hotel">
<text>Gleneagles Hotel is a hotel near Auchterarder, Scotland. It was commissioned by the Caledonian Railway and opened in 1924. The bandleader Henry Hall performed at the hotel before the Second World War during which it served as a military hospital. There are three tournament-standard golf courses in the grounds and the hotel was redeveloped for the 40th Ryder Cup in 2014. Significant conferences at the hotel have included the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1977 and the 31st G8 summit in July 2005. It is a Category B listed building.

==History==
Construction of the hotel was commenced by the Caledonian Railway (CR), which also built the nearby Gleneagles railway station. However, by the time it opened in 1924, the CR had been absorbed by the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS). It was equipped with its own dedicated railway branch line. An up-and-coming dance band leader named Henry Hall was involved in buying their pianos, and organising the dance band entertainment. He decided that radio broadcasts would be an ideal way to advertise the new hotel, so was given permission to move his Trafford Band from Manchester&#x27;s Midland Hotel to the Gleneagles and form a new band in Manchester. The hotel&#x27;s opening night was celebrated with Scotland&#x27;s first ever outside broadcast on 7 June 1924.

After the season ended, the band moved to the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool. Summer 1925 saw the band return to Gleneagles, although their commercial recordings were made in Manchester, and the winter seasons were in Liverpool.

During World War II, as with many large country hotels, it was converted into Gleneagles Hospital under the charge of Dr Thomas Ferguson as Medical Superintendent. In 1948 ownership of the hotel passed from LMS to the British Transport Commission and in 1963 to British Transport Hotels.

In 1980 the hotel was designated as a Category B listed building. In 1981, British Transport Hotels sold Gleneagles to a newly established private sector operator, Gleneagles Hotels plc. In 1984 it was acquired by Arthur Bell &amp; Sons, which came into the ownership of Guinness in 1985 and Diageo in 1997.

Between 1982 and 1986, £11 million was spent on renovation and since 1982 the hotel has been open all year round. In 1986, and every year since, the hotel has been awarded five red stars by the AA. The hotel remained owned by Diageo, until it was sold to a private investment company Ennismore in 2015.

The hotel was redeveloped in preparation for hosting the 40th Ryder Cup in 2014 played on the PGA Centenary Course.

==Facilities==

Gleneagles has three golf courses: the King&#x27;s Course, Queen&#x27;s Course and PGA Centenary Course, previously known as the Monarch&#x27;s Course. There is also a nine-hole course called the PGA National Academy Course, informally known as the Wee Course. Gleneagles Golf Academy opened in 1994 and in 2010 was re-branded to The PGA National Academy for Scotland. The Jack Nicklaus-designed PGA Centenary Course opened in 1993 and hosted the Ryder Cup in 2014. When asked about his work, Nicklaus said, &quot;It&#x27;s the finest parcel of land in the world I have ever been given to work with.&quot;

Tournaments that have taken place at Gleneagles include:

*Glasgow Herald Tournament from 1920 to 1927
*Curtis Cup in 1936
*Women&#x27;s British Open in 1957
*Scottish Open from 1987 to 1994
*McDonald&#x27;s WPGA Championship of Europe from 1996 to 1999
*Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles from 1999 to 2013
*40th Ryder Cup Matches in 2014
*European Golf Team Championships in 2018
*Solheim Cup and Junior Solheim Cup in 2019
*Senior Open Championship in 2022

The British School of Falconry has been located at Gleneagles since 1992.

The village of Glenmor has holiday homes set within the grounds of the hotel.

==Conferences==

Conferences have included:
*Gleneagles Agreement on sporting contacts with South Africa at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1977.
*The 1986 meeting (25–27 April) of the Bilderberg Group.
*31st G8 summit in July 2005. This meeting saw the foundation of the G8+5.

==Awards==
Gleneagles Hotel has won/holds various awards, including:

* 5 Red AA Stars (since 1986)
* Conde Nast Gold List 2009 – Best Hotel in the World for Facilities
* Scotland&#x27;s leading resort at the World Travel Awards 2008

<doc id="1290523" wikidata="Q6137902" url="?curid=1290523" title="Union Grounds">
<text>Union Grounds was a baseball park located in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York. The grounds opened in 1862, its inaugural match being played on May 15. It was the first baseball park enclosed entirely by a fence, thereby allowing proprietor William Cammeyer or his tenant to charge admission. This permitted paying customers to watch the games from benches in a stand while non-paying spectators could only watch from embankments outside the grounds.

==Overview==
The ball grounds was built on a large block bounded by Harrison Avenue, Rutledge Street, Lynch Street, and Marcy Avenue (Marcy also bordered the Capitoline Grounds). A writer for the Brooklyn Eagle described the field in 1862: &quot;The buildings occupied last winter are left standing, used pretty much for the same purposes as them.[sic] Near these a long wooden shed has been erected, capable of accommodating several hundred persons, and benches provided for the convenience of the fair sex... Several acres more have been added to the enclosure, which is fenced in with a board fence six or seven feet in height. On the southeast corner a large and commodious club house has been erected, containing accommodations for three clubs. The field is now almost a perfect level, covering at least some six acres of ground, all of which is well drained, rolled, and in a few weeks will be in splendid condition... Several flagstaffs have been put up, from which floated the banners of the clubs o&#x27;er shadowed by the nations&#x27; ensign.&quot;

During its early years Union Grounds was the home field for several ballclubs, notably including the Eckford Club, 1862 and 1863 champions of the National Association of Base Ball Players. In 1868, the Mutual Club of New York moved in from Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey, long-time home of Manhattan clubs but never enclosed. The ballpark&#x27;s entrance was on Rutledge Street, and a one-story building in right field, 350 feet away from home plate, was in play. The diamond was in the northeast portion of the block, off Harrison Avenue. The church seen in the background of various illustrations was St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, which stood at the corner of Marcy and Penn. The church was completed in 1861 and was demolished around 1930.

After formation of the first professional league, the National Association of &quot;Professional&quot; Base Ball Players, Union Grounds was home to the Mutual Club from 1871 to 1876 (the only year as a member of the new National League), Eckford of Brooklyn of the National Association in 1872, and the Atlantic Club of Brooklyn of the National Association from 1873 to 1875. It served as home field for the &quot;Hartford of Brooklyn&quot; team during the 1877 National League season. Some clubs also occasionally staged single games on the grounds, including a season-ending &quot;home&quot; game for the Chicago White Stockings in October 1871, whose own home grounds had been destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire. On July 26, 1878, the final major league game was played on the grounds, with Providence defeating Milwaukee 4–1. The grounds continued to host barnstorming major league clubs, amateur clubs and independent clubs through the 1882 season.

The park did not sit idle during the winter. Its field was flooded and served as the rink for an ice skating club. An unusual feature of the park was the presence of a pagoda in center field.
Union Grounds was demolished in July of 1883. Heyward Street now runs through the site, and as of 2009 the Juan Morel Campos Secondary School stands to the north of Heyward Street and the Marcy Avenue Armory stands to the south of it, with no historical marker or any other indication of the land&#x27;s significance to the history of baseball.

<text>In Norse mythology, Ótr (Old Norse: ; alternately: Ott, Oter, Otr, Ottar, Ottarr, Otter) is a dwarf. He is the son of the king Hreidmar and the brother of Fafnir and Regin.

According to the Prose Edda, Ótr could change into any form and used to spend his days in the shape of an otter, greedily eating fish. In this form, he was slain by Loki, who wanted his pelt. Initially, Hreidmar demanded a life for a life, but with the argument that the murder had been an accident when no one involved knew that Ótr was a dwarf, he settled for receiving a large weregild for Ótr&#x27;s death, namely to fill Ótr&#x27;s skin with yellow gold and to then cover it entirely with red gold. When the skin was covered, one whisker still protruded, forcing Loki to give up the ring Andvarinaut to hide it. The ring had been stolen from, and cursed by, the dwarf Andvari. It is suggested that this story was meant to show the benefits of not only adhering to the letter of the law (repayment for manslaughter) but sticking to the spirit of the law as well (not demanding an exorbitant ransom). Greed for this cursed treasure ultimately caused the deaths of Hreidmar and his two surviving sons: Hreidmar was killed by Fafnir, who transformed into a dragon, and the other two were slain by Sigurd&#x27;s sword Gram.

<text>Jewish cuisine refers to the worldwide cooking traditions of the Jewish people. During its evolution over the course of many centuries, it has been shaped by Jewish dietary laws (&quot;kashrut&quot;), Jewish festivals and holidays, and traditions centred around Shabbat. Jewish cuisine is influenced by the economics, agriculture, and culinary traditions of the many countries where Jewish communities have settled and varies widely throughout the entire world.

The history of Jewish cuisine begins with the cuisine of the ancient Israelites. As the Jewish diaspora grew, different styles of Jewish cooking developed. The distinctive styles in Jewish cuisine vary according to each community across the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi diaspora groupings; there are also notable dishes within the culinary traditions of the standalone significant Jewish diaspora communities from Greece, Iran, and Yemen.

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, and particularly since the late 1970s, a nascent Israeli &quot;fusion cuisine&quot; has developed. Israeli cuisine has adapted a multitude of elements, overlapping techniques and ingredients from the many culinary traditions of the Jewish diaspora.

==Influences on Jewish cuisine==

===&quot;Kashrut&quot;—Jewish dietary laws===
The laws of keeping kosher (&quot;kashrut&quot;) have influenced Jewish cooking by prescribing what foods are permitted and how food must be prepared. The word kosher is usually translated as &quot;proper&quot;.

Certain foods, notably pork, shellfish and almost all insects are forbidden; meat and dairy cannot be eaten together in one dish and a certain period of time must elapse before dairy food can be eaten following a meat dish. The length of time depends on a specific minhag (tradition). It is most common to wait six hours but some groups wait three or one. Meat must be ritually slaughtered and salted to remove all traces of blood.

Observant Jews will eat only meat or poultry that is certified kosher. The meat has to have been slaughtered by a &quot;shochet&quot; (ritual slaughterer) in accordance with Jewish law and must be entirely drained of blood. Before it is cooked, it is soaked in water for half an hour, then placed on a perforated board, sprinkled with coarse salt (which draws out the blood) and left to sit for one hour. At the end of this time, the salt is washed off and the meat is ready for cooking.

Today, kosher meats purchased from a butcher or supermarket have already undergone the &quot;koshering&quot; process as described in the previous paragraph and no additional soaking or salting is required.

According to &quot;kashrut&quot;, meat and poultry must not be eaten with dairy products, nor may they be eaten from plates or with utensils that have been used with dairy products. Therefore, Jews who strictly observe &quot;kashrut&quot; divide their kitchens into different sections for meat and for dairy, with separate ovens, plates and utensils (or as much as is reasonable, given financial and space constraints; there are procedures to &quot;kasher&quot; utensils that have touched dairy to allow their use for meat).

As a result, butter, milk and cream are not used in preparing dishes made with meat or intended to be served together with meat. Oil, &quot;pareve&quot; margarine, rendered chicken fat (often called schmaltz in the Ashkenazi tradition), or non-dairy cream substitutes are used instead.

Despite religious prohibitions, some foods not generally considered kosher have made their way into traditional Jewish cuisine; sturgeon, which was consumed by European Jews at least as far back as the 19th century, is one example.

===Geographical dispersion===

The hearty cuisine of Ashkenazi Jews was based on centuries of living in the cold climate of Central and Eastern Europe, whereas the lighter, &quot;sunnier&quot; cuisine of Sephardi Jews was influenced by life in the Mediterranean region.

Each Jewish community has its traditional dishes, often revolving around specialties from their home country. In Spain and Portugal, olives are a common ingredient and many foods are fried in oil. The idea of frying fish in the stereotypically British fish and chips, for example, was introduced to Britain by Sephardic Jewish immigrants. In Germany, stews were popular. The Jews of Netherlands specialized in pickles, herring, butter cakes and &quot;bolas&quot; (jamrolls). In Poland, Jews made various kinds of stuffed and stewed fish along with matza ball soup or &quot;lokshen&quot; noodles. In North Africa, Jews ate &quot;couscous&quot; and &quot;tagine&quot;.

Thus, a traditional Shabbat meal for Ashkenazi Jews might include stuffed vine leaves, roast beef, pot roast, or chicken, carrots &quot;tzimmes&quot; and potatoes. A traditional Shabbat meal for Sephardi Jews would focus more on salads, &quot;couscous&quot; and other Middle-Eastern specialties.

==History of Jewish cuisine==

===Biblical era===

The daily diet of the average ancient Israelite consisted mainly of bread, cooked grains and legumes. Bread was eaten with every meal. The bread eaten until the end of the Israelite monarchy was mostly made from barley flour.

During the Second Temple era, bread made from wheat flour became predominant. A variety of breads was produced. Probably most common were unleavened flat loaves called &quot;ugah&quot; or &quot;kikkar.&quot; Another type was a thin wafer, known as a &quot;rakik.&quot; A thicker loaf, known as &quot;hallah,&quot; was made with the best-quality flour, usually for ritual purposes. Bread was sometimes enriched by the addition of flour from legumes (Ezekiel 4:9).

The Mishna (Hallah 2:2) mentions bread dough made with fruit juice instead of water to sweeten the bread. The Israelites also sometimes added fennel and cumin to bread dough for flavor and dipped their bread in vinegar (Ruth 2:14), olive oil, or sesame oil for extra flavor.

Vegetables played a smaller, but significant role in the diet. Legumes and vegetables were typically eaten in stews. Stews made of lentils or beans were common and they were cooked with onion, garlic, and leeks for flavor. Fresh legumes were also roasted, or dried and stored for extended periods, then cooked in a soup or a stew. Vegetables were also eaten uncooked with bread. Lentils were the most important of the legumes and were used to make pottages and soups, as well as fried lentil cakes called ashishim.

The Israelites drank goat and sheep&#x27;s milk when it was available in the spring and summer and ate butter and cheese. They also ate honey, both from bees and date honey.

Figs and grapes were the fruits most commonly eaten, while dates, pomegranates, almonds, and other fruits and nuts were eaten more occasionally.

Wine was the most popular beverage and sometimes other fermented beverages were produced.

Meat, usually goat and mutton, was eaten rarely by most Israelites and reserved for special occasions, such as celebrations, festival meals, or sacrificial feasts. The wealthy ate meat more frequently and had beef, venison, and veal available to them.

Olives were used primarily for their oil, which was used raw and to cook meat and stews. Game (usually deer and gazelle), birds, eggs, and fish were also eaten, depending on availability. Meat was typically prepared in broths or stews, and sometimes roasted. For long-term storage, meat was smoked, dried, or salted.
Porridge and gruel were made from ground grain, water, salt, and butter. This mixture also formed the basis for cakes, to which oil, called &quot;shemen&quot;, and fruits were sometimes added before baking.

Most food was eaten fresh and in season. Fruits and vegetables had to be eaten as they ripened and before they spoiled.

People had to contend with periodic episodes of hunger and famine. Producing enough food required hard and well-timed labor and the climatic conditions resulted in unpredictable harvests and the need to store as much food as possible. Thus, grapes were made into raisins and wine, olives were made into oil, figs, beans and lentils were dried and grains were stored for use throughout the year.

As fresh milk tended to spoil quickly, the Israelites stored milk in skin containers that caused it to curdle quickly and drank it as thick sour milk which they called laban.

The Israelites ate a variety of fresh and saltwater fish, according to both archaeological and textual evidence. Remains of freshwater fish from the Yarkon and Jordan rivers and the Sea of Galilee have been found in excavations, and include St. Peter’s fish and mouthbreeders. Saltwater fish discovered in excavations include sea bream, grouper, meager, and gray mullet. Most of these come from the Mediterranean Sea, but in the later Iron Age period, some are from the Red Sea. Although the Torah prohibits the consumption of fish without fins or scales, archeological evidence indicates that many Israelites flouted or were unaware of these restrictions and ate non-kosher seafood, mostly catfish but also shark, eel, and ray, and that religious restrictions on seafood began to be observed more strictly starting in the first century CE.

Descriptions of typical Israelite meals appear in the Bible. The Book of Samuel described the rations Abigail brought to David&#x27;s group: bread loaves, wine, butchered sheep, parched grain, raisins, and fig cakes. The Book of Ruth described a typical light breakfast: bread dipped in vinegar and parched or roasted grain.

The cuisine maintained many consistent traits based on the main products available from the early Israelite period until the Roman period, even though new foods became available during this extended time. For example, rice was introduced during the Persian era.

During the Hellenistic period, as trade with the Nabateans increased, more spices became available, at least for those who could afford them and more Mediterranean fish were imported into the cities. During the Roman period, sugar cane was introduced.

The symbolic food of the ancient Israelites continued to be important among Jews after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and the beginning of the Jewish diaspora.

Bread, wine and olive oil were seen as direct links to the three main crops of ancient Israel—wheat, grapes and olives. In the Bible, this trio is described as representing the divine response to human needs () and, particularly, the need for the seasonal rains vital for the successful cultivation of these three crops. ().

The significance of wine, bread and oil is indicated by their incorporation into Jewish religious ritual, with the blessings over wine and bread for Shabbat and holiday meals and at religious ceremonies such as weddings and the lighting of Shabbat and festival lights with olive oil.

Modern Jewish cooking originated in the various communities of the Jewish diaspora, and modern Jewish cuisine bears little resemblance to what the ancient Israelites ate. However, a few dishes that originated in ancient Israel survive to the present day. Notably among them is cholent, or &quot;hamin&quot;, a stew traditionally eaten on Shabbat that is simmered for 12 hours in a way that conforms with Shabbat restrictions. It dates to at least the Second Temple period. Various diaspora communities created their own variations of the dish based on their local climate and available ingredients, which are eaten today.

Other foods dating to the ancient Israelites include &quot;pastels&quot;, or Shabbat meat pies, and charoset, a sweet fruit and nut paste eaten at the Passover Seder.

===Talmudic era===
Bread was a staple food and as in the Bible, the meal is designated by the simple term &quot;to eat bread&quot;, so the rabbinical law ordains that the blessing pronounced upon bread covers everything else except wine and dessert. Bread was made not only from wheat, but also from barley, rice, millet, lentils, etc.

Many kinds of fruit were eaten. There was a custom to eat apples during Shavuot, while specific fruit and herbs were eaten on holidays and special occasions such as Rosh Hashana. Children received nuts and roasted ears of grain especially on the evening of Passover. Olives were so common that they were used as a measure (&quot;zayit&quot;).

Meat was eaten only on special occasions, on Shabbat and at feasts. The pious kept fine cattle for Shabbat (Beẓah 16a), but various other kinds of dishes, relishes and spices were also on the table. Deer, also, furnished meat, as did pheasant, chickens and pigeons.

Fermented fish sauce was an important article of commerce, being called &quot;garum&quot; among the Jews, as among the Greeks and Romans. Pliny says expressly of a &quot;garum castimoniale&quot; (i.e., kosher garum) that it was prepared according to Jewish law. A specific type of locust was eaten. Eggs were so commonly eaten that the quantity of an egg was used as a measure.

The devastation of the Bar-Kokhba revolt greatly reduced the variety of the local diet. In its aftermath, the amount of imported goods declined and vegetables became a luxury. The typical meal consisted of a slice of bread dipped in olive oil, a soup or gruel of legumes, and fruits, especially figs. On Shabbat, a small amount of fish and vegetables were eaten.

While pork was prohibited by Jewish laws as described under &quot;kashrut&quot;, the refusal to eat pork only became central to Jewish identity while under Roman rule. Pork consumption during the Roman period increased and became closely affiliated with Romans not only as a common cuisine but also as a frequently sacrificed animal. Jordan Rosenblum has argued that by not consuming pork, Jews maintained their sense of particularity and even held a silent revolt against the Roman Empire.

====Structure of meal====
The first dish was a pickled starter to stimulate the appetite, followed by the main meal, which ended with a dessert, called in Greek . &quot;Afiḳomen&quot; is used in the same sense. Tidbits () were eaten before and after the meal (Ber. vi. 6).

Wine was flavored with myrrh or with honey and pepper, the mixture being called &quot;conditum&quot;. There was vinegar wine, wine from Amanus and Cilicia, red wine from Saron, Ethiopian wine, and black wine. Certain wines were considered good for the stomach, others not. There was beer from Egypt called &quot;zythos&quot; (Pes. iii. 1) and beer made from a thorn &quot;Spina regia&quot;.

Emphasis was placed on drinking with the meal as eating without drinking (any liquid) causes stomach trouble.

===Middle Ages===

The Jews were so widely scattered in the Middle Ages that it is difficult to give a connected account of their mode of living as to food. In Arabic countries the author of the &quot;Halakhot Gedolot&quot; knew some dishes that appear to have been specific Jewish foods, e.g., &quot;paspag&quot;, which was, perhaps, biscuit.

According to the &quot;Siddur Amram&quot;, the well-known &quot;&quot;ḥaroset&quot; is made in those countries from a mixture of herbs, flour and honey (Arabic,&quot;ḥalikah&quot;&quot;).

Maimonides, in his &quot;Sefer Refu&#x27;ot&quot;, mentions dishes that are good for health. He recommends bread baked from wheat that is not too new, nor too old, nor too fine, further, the meat of the kid, sheep and chicken and the yolks of eggs. Goats&#x27; and cows&#x27; milk is good, nor are cheese and butter harmful. Honey is good for old people; fish with solid white flesh meat is wholesome; so also are wine and dried fruits. Fresh fruits, however, are unwholesome, and he does not recommend garlic or onions.

There is detailed information about Italian Jewish cookery in the book &quot;Massechet Purim&quot;. It discusses pies, chestnuts, turtledoves, pancakes, small tarts, gingerbread, ragouts, venison, roast goose, chicken, stuffed pigeons, ducks, pheasants, partridges, quails, macaroons and salad. These were considered luxuries.

The oppressed medieval Jews enjoyed large meals only on Shabbat, festivals, circumcisions and weddings. For example, the Jews of Rhodes, according to a letter of Ovadiah Bartinura, 1488, lived on herbs and vegetables only, never tasting meat or wine. In Egypt, however, meat, fish and cheese were obtainable, in Gaza, grapes, fruit and wine. Cold dishes are still relished in the East. Generally, only one dish was eaten, with fresh bread daily.

Some Jewish dishes frequently mentioned in Yiddish literature from the 12th century onward are &quot;brätzel&quot;, &quot;lokshen&quot;, &quot;pasteten&quot;, &quot;fladen&quot;, &quot;beleg&quot;.

&quot;Barscht&quot; or borscht is a Ukrainian beet soup, best known are the &quot;berkes&quot; or &quot;barches&quot; (challah) eaten on Shabbat, and &quot;shalet&quot; (cholent), which Heine commemorates, and which the Spanish Jews called &quot;ani&quot; (hamin). Shabbat pudding, &quot;kigl&quot; or kugel in Yiddish, is also well known.

===Modern era===

In the United States, in particular, Jewish cooking (and the cookbooks that recorded and guided it) evolved in ways that illuminate changes in the role of Jewish women and the Jewish home.

Jewish cuisine has also played a big part in shaping the restaurant scene in the West, in particular in the UK and US. Israeli cuisine in particular has become a niche food trend in the UK, with Israeli restaurants now opening up sister restaurants in London and beyond.

In the 1930s there were four Jewish bakeries in Minneapolis within a few blocks of each other baking bagels and other fresh breads. Jewish families purchased &quot;challah&quot; loaves for their Sabbath meal at one North Side bakery. There were two kosher meat markets and four Jewish delicatessens, one of which began distribution for what would become Sara Lee frozen cheesecakes. The delis sold sandwiches like corned beef and salami.

In Chicago Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe ate a type of oatmeal cereal called &quot;krupnik&quot; that sometimes had barley, potatoes and fat added, and milk when it was available. Orthodox Jews continued to observe &quot;kashrut&quot;. Sweatshop laborers carried bagels, knish and herring to work.

==Jewish cuisine variations==

Jewish cuisines vary widely depending on their regions of origin, but they tend to be broadly categorized into Sephardi (Iberian and North African), Mizrahi (Middle Eastern and Central Asian) and Ashkenazi (Eastern, Western and Central European) families.

Still, there is significant overlap between the different cuisines, as Jews have often migrated great distances and as different regions where Jews have settled (e.g. Southeastern Europe) have been influenced by different cultures over time. For example, Balkan Jewish cuisine contains both Ashkenazi/European and Sephardic-Turkish influences, as this part of Europe (up to the borders of present-day Austria and Poland) was for a time part of the Ottoman Empire.

Since the rise of Ashkenazi Jewish migration to 19th-century Palestine and the establishment of the State of Israel, increased contact between Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews has led to a rising importance of Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine amongst Jews of all backgrounds.

===Ashkenazi===

While Ashkenazi cuisine as it is known today is largely based within the context of American-Jewish and Ashkenazi-Israeli food, much of the culinary tradition of Ashkenazi Jews springs from Central, Western and Eastern Europe, and a good part of that from China. Jordan Paper writes:-
For many Americans, Baltic and Eastern European food is the epitome of Jewish cuisine, although any ordinary restaurant in Poland, Ukraine, or northwestern Russia, aside from offering pork and mixing meat and dairy, would by that criterion be Jewish. Some of these foods have become part of festival rituals, such as latkes (potato pancakes) during Hanukkah. But unless the Maccabees were in Peru nearly two thousand years before the Spanish arrived, latkes are a relatively recent northeastern European addition to the festivities. The influence of modern Israel on contemporary North American Jewish consciousness has meant that the typical foods of the southern and eastern Mediterranean shores are now also considered Jewish. By that logic, the cuisine of central China should be understood as Jewish also... Actually many so-called Ashkenazi Jewish dishes – such as knishes (Chinese: &quot;baozi&quot;), kreplach (&quot;hundun&quot;), blintzes (&quot;chunjuian&quot;), piroshki (&quot;zhengjaio&quot;), and many noodle preparations-are northern Chinese. They were brought to Poland and Ukraine in the thirteenth century by the invading Mongol army, which had chefs, as well as military technicians, from northern China.&#x27;

After having been expelled from Western Europe in the Middle Ages, Jews were forced to live in poverty and thus were limited in terms of ingredients. Dishes were made with fewer components; they were not heavily spiced and ingredients that were more flavorful had to be used sparingly. This is often why some dishes in Ashkenazic cuisine are known for being blander than dishes in Sephardic or Mizrahi cuisine.

The cuisine is based largely on ingredients that were affordable for the historically poor Ashkenazi Jewish communities of Europe, often composed of ingredients that were readily available in Europe and which were perceived to be less desirable and rarely used by their gentile neighbors, such as brisket, chicken liver, and artichokes, among other ingredients.

As Ashkenazi Jews were typically forbidden to grow crops in their home countries in Europe, their cuisine reflects that and there are less vegetable-focused dishes in their cuisine compared to their Sephardi and Mizrahi counterparts.

Meat is ritually slaughtered in the &quot;shechita&quot; process, and is soaked and salted. Meat dishes are a prominent feature of Shabbat, festival, and celebratory meals. Braised meats such as brisket feature heavily, as do root vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, and parsnips which are used in such dishes as latkes, matzo ball soup, and &quot;tzimmes&quot;.

Cooked, stuffed and baked vegetables such as stuffed cabbage are central to the cuisine. Due to the lack of availability of olive oil and other fats traditionally used in Jewish cooking, fat from leftover chicken and goose skins (&quot;gribenes&quot;) called &quot;schmaltz&quot; is traditionally used in &quot;fleishig&quot; (meat) dishes, while butter is traditionally used in &quot;milchig&quot; (dairy) dishes.

====Fish====

With kosher meat not always available, fish became an important staple of the Jewish diet. In Eastern Europe it was sometimes especially reserved for Shabbat. As fish is not considered meat by the culinary definition nor in the Judaic context, it is consumed by many observant Jews who consider to be permissible to eat fish with milk and other dairy products. However, within various Jewish communities there are different rules regarding fish and dairy. For instance, many Sephardim do not mix fish with milk or any other kind of dairy product. Similarly, the Chabad-Hasidic custom is not to consume fish together with specifically milk; however, it is permissible to eat fish and other dairy products &quot;(ex; butter, cheese, cream)&quot; at the same time.

Even though fish is parve, when they are served at the same meal, Orthodox Jews will eat them during separate courses and wash (or replace) the dishes in between. Gefilte fish and lox are popular in Ashkenazi cuisine.

Though the combination of dairy and fish is generally acceptable, fish is the only parve food that the Talmud places restrictions on when it is being baked/eaten alongside meat. Talmudic reasoning for not eating meat and fish together originates from health and sanitary concerns rather than holy obligations. Unlike with milk and meat, it is kosher to eat fish and meat at the same meal as long as they&#x27;re baked separately, they&#x27;re served on separate plates as separate courses, the same utensils aren&#x27;t shared, and between courses the mouth is thoroughly cleansed with a beverage and the palate is neutralized with a different food.

Gefilte fish (from Yiddish געפֿילטע פֿיש &quot;gefilte fish&quot;, &quot;stuffed fish&quot;) was traditionally made by skinning the fish steaks, usually German or French carp, de-boning the flesh, mincing it and sometimes mixing with finely chopped browned onions (3:1), eggs, salt or pepper and vegetable oil. The fish skin and head were then stuffed with the mixture and poached. The religious reason for a boneless fish dish for the Sabbath is the prohibition of separating bones from food while eating [the prohibition of &quot;borer&quot;, separating]

A more common commercially packaged product found today is the &quot;Polish&quot; gefilte fish patties or balls, similar to &quot;quenelles&quot;, where sugar is added to the broth, resulting in a slightly sweet taste. Strictly speaking they are the fish filling, rather than the complete filled fish. This method of serving evolved from the tradition of removing the stuffing from the skin, rather than portioning the entire fish into slices before serving.

While traditionally made with carp or whitefish and sometimes pike, gefilte fish may also be made from any large fish: cod, haddock, or hake in the United Kingdom.

The combination of smoked salmon, or whitefish with bagels and cream cheese is a traditional breakfast or brunch in American Jewish cuisine, made famous at New York City appetizing stores and Jewish dairy restaurants, and kosher style Jewish delis.

Vorschmack or &quot;gehakte hering&quot; (chopped herring), a popular appetizer on Shabbat, is made by chopping skinned, boned herrings with hard-boiled eggs, sometimes onions, apples, sugar or pepper and a dash of vinegar.

====Soups====

A number of soups are characteristically Ashkenazi, one of the most common of which is chicken soup traditionally served on Shabbat, holidays and special occasions.

The soup may be served with noodles (&quot;lokshen&quot; in Yiddish). It is often served with &quot;shkedei marak&quot; (lit. &quot;soup almonds&quot;, croutons popular in Israel), called &quot;mandlen&quot; or &quot;mandlach&quot; in Yiddish. Other popular ingredients are &quot;kreplach&quot; (dumplings) and matza balls &quot;(kneidlach)&quot; – a mixture of matza meal, eggs, water, and pepper or salt. Some reserve &quot;kneidlach&quot; for Passover and &quot;kreplach&quot; for other special occasions.

In the preparation of a number of soups, neither meat nor fat is used. Such soups formed the food of the poor classes. An expression among Jews of Eastern Europe, &quot;soup mit nisht&quot; (soup with nothing), owes its origin to soups of this kind.

Soups such as borsht were considered a staple in Ukraine. Soups like &quot;krupnik&quot; were made of barley, potatoes and fat. This was the staple food of the poor students of the &quot;yeshivot&quot;; in richer families, meat was added to this soup.

At weddings, &quot;golden&quot; chicken soup was often served. The reason for its name is probably the yellow circles of molten chicken fat floating on its surface. Today, chicken soup is widely referred to (not just among Jews) in jest as &quot;Jewish penicillin&quot;, and hailed as a cure for the common cold.

There are a number of sour soups in the borscht category. One is &quot;kraut&quot; or cabbage borscht, made by cooking together cabbage, meat, bones, onions, raisins, sour salt (citric acid), sugar and sometimes tomatoes.

Beet borsht is served hot or cold. In the cold version, a beaten egg yolk may be added before serving and each bowl topped with a dollop of sour cream. This last process is called &quot;farweissen&quot; (to make white).

====Bread and cake====

The dough of challah (called &quot;barkhes&quot; in Western Yiddish) is often shaped into forms having symbolical meanings; thus on Rosh Hashanah rings and coins are imitated, indicating &quot;May the new year be as round and complete as these&quot;; for Hosha&#x27;na Rabbah, bread is baked in the form of a key, meaning &quot;May the door of heaven open to admit our prayers.&quot; Challah bread is most commonly braided or made in round roll shapes.

The &quot;hamentash&quot;, a triangular cookie or turnover filled with fruit preserves (&quot;lekvar&quot;) or honey and black poppy seed paste, is eaten on the Feast of Purim. It is said to be shaped like the ears of Haman the tyrant. The &quot;mohn kihel&quot; is a circular or rectangular wafer sprinkled with poppy seed. &quot;Pirushkes&quot;, or turnovers, are little cakes fried in honey or dipped in molasses after they are baked. Strudel is served for dessert. Kugels are prepared from rice, noodles or mashed potatoes.

In Eastern Europe, the Jews baked black (&quot;proster&quot;, or &quot;ordinary&quot;) bread, white bread and challah. The most common form is the twist (&quot;koilitch&quot; or &quot;kidke&quot; from the Romanian word &quot;încolăci&quot; which means &quot;to twist&quot;). The &quot;koilitch&quot; is oval in form and about one and a half feet in length. On special occasions, such as weddings, the &quot;koilitch&quot; is increased to a length of about two and a half feet.

The bagel, which originated in Poland, is a popular Ashkenazi food and became widespread in the United States.

====Meat and fats====
&quot;Gebratenes&quot; (roasted meat), chopped meat and &quot;essig-fleisch&quot; (vinegar meat) are favorite meat recipes. The &quot;essig&quot; or, as it is sometimes called, &quot;honig&quot; or &quot;sauerbraten&quot;, is made by adding to meat which has been partially roasted with some sugar, bay leaves, pepper, raisins, salt and a little vinegar. Knish is a snack food consisting of a meat or potato filling covered with dough that is either baked or grilled.

A popular dish among Ashkenazim, as amongst most Eastern-Europeans, is &quot;pierogi&quot; (which are related to but distinct from &quot;kreplach&quot;), often filled with minced beef. &quot;Kishka&quot; is a popular Ashkenazi dish traditionally made of stuffing of flour or matza meal, &quot;schmaltz&quot; and spices.

The rendered fat of chickens, known as &quot;schmaltz&quot;, is sometimes kept in readiness for cooking use when needed. &quot;Gribenes&quot; or &quot;scraps&quot;, also called &quot;griven,&quot; the cracklings left from the rendering process were one of the favorite foods in Eastern Europe. &quot;Schmaltz&quot; is eaten spread on bread.

A spread of chopped liver, prepared with onions and often including &quot;gribenes&quot;, is a popular appetizer, side dish, or snack, especially among Jews on the eastern coast of North America. It is usually served with rye bread or crackers. Brisket is also a popular Ashkenazi dish of braised beef brisket.

&quot;Holishkes&quot;, stuffed cabbage, also known as the cabbage roll, is also a European Jewish dish that emerged from more impoverished times for Jews. Because having a live cow was more valuable than to eat meat in the Middle Ages, Jews used fillers such as breadcrumbs and vegetables to mix with ground beef. This gave the effect of more meat being stuffed into the cabbage leaves.

====Sweets and confections====

&quot;Teiglach&quot;, traditionally served on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, consists of little balls of dough (about the size of a marble) drenched in a honey syrup. &quot;Ingberlach&quot; are ginger candies shaped into small sticks or rectangles.

In Europe, jellies and preserves made from fruit juice were used as pastry filling or served with tea. Among the poor, jelly was reserved for invalids, hence the practice of reciting the Yiddish saying (May we not have occasion to use it) before storing it away.

&quot;Flodni&quot;, a layered sweet pastry consisting of apples, walnuts, currants and poppy seeds, were a staple of Hungarian Jewish bakeries prior to World War II.

Because it was easy to prepare, made from inexpensive ingredients and contained no dairy products, compote became a staple dessert in Jewish households throughout Europe and was considered part of Jewish cuisine.

====Side dishes====

&quot;Tzimmes&quot; consists generally of cooked vegetables or fruits, sometimes with meat added. The most popular vegetable is the carrot (&quot;mehren tzimmes&quot;), which is sliced. Turnips were also used for &quot;tzimmes&quot;, particularly in Lithuania. In southern Russia, Galicia and Romania &quot;tzimmes&quot; was made of pears, apples, figs, prunes or plums (&quot;floymn tzimmes&quot;).

&quot;Kreplach&quot;, similar to Russian &quot;pelmeni&quot;, are ravioli-like dumplings made from flour and eggs mixed into a dough, rolled into sheets, cut into squares and then filled with finely chopped, seasoned meat or cheese. They are most often served in soup, but may be fried. &quot;Kreplech&quot; are eaten on various holidays, among them Purim and Hosha&#x27;na Rabbah.

===Sephardi, Mizrahi and Italian Jewish cuisine===
The exact distinction between traditional Sephardic and Mizrahi cuisines can be difficult to make, due to the intermingling of the Sephardi diaspora and the Mizrahi Jews with whom they came in contact.

As a general rule, however, both types reflect the food of the local non-Jewish population that each group lived amongst. The need to preserve &quot;kashrut&quot; does lead to a few significant changes (most notably, the use of olive oil instead of animal fat is often considered to be a legacy of Jewish residency in an area, due to the fact that olive oil may be eaten with milk, unlike animal fat).

Despite this, Sephardic and Ashkenazic concepts of kosher differ; perhaps the most notable difference being that rice, a major staple of the Sephardic diet, is considered kosher for Passover among Sephardim but it is forbidden as &quot;kitniyot&quot; by most Ashkenazim.

Sephardi cuisine emphasizes salads, stuffed vegetables and vine leaves, olive oil, lentils, fresh and dried fruits, herbs and nuts, and chickpeas. Meat dishes often make use of lamb or ground beef. Fresh lemon juice is added to many soups and sauces.

Many meat and rice dishes incorporate dried fruits such as apricots, prunes and raisins. Pine nuts are used as a garnish. Mizrahi cuisine is based largely on fresh ingredients, as marketing was done in the local souq.

Meat is ritually slaughtered in the &quot;shechita&quot; process, and is soaked and salted. Meat dishes are a prominent feature of Shabbat, festival, and celebratory meals.

Cooked, stuffed and baked vegetables are central to the cuisine, as are various kinds of beans, chickpeas, lentils and burghul (cracked wheat). Rice takes the place of potatoes.

Coming from the Mediterranean and &quot;sunny&quot; climes, Mizrahi cuisine is often light, with an emphasis on salads, stuffed vegetables and vine leaves, olive oil, lentils, fresh and dried fruits, herbs and nuts, and chickpeas. Meat dishes often make use of lamb or ground beef. Fresh lemon juice is added to many soups and sauces.

Many meat and rice dishes incorporate dried fruits such as apricots, prunes and raisins. Pine nuts are used as a garnish. Pomegranate juice is a staple of Persian Jewish cooking. &quot;Kubbeh&quot;, a meat-stuffed bulgur dumpling, features in the cooking of many Mizrahi communities. It is served in the cooking broth, as a kind of soup.

Sephardic cuisine in particular is known for its considerable use of vegetables unavailable to the Ashkenazim of Europe, including spinach, artichokes, pine nuts and (in more modern times) squash.

The cooking style is largely Middle Eastern, with significant admixtures of Spanish, Italian and North African flavors. The most popular Sephardic and Mizrahi dishes include &quot;malawach&quot;, &quot;jachnun&quot;, &quot;sabich&quot;, &quot;mofletta&quot;, &quot;meorav yerushalmi, and kubaneh&quot;. Popular condiments include &quot;skhug&quot; and &quot;amba&quot;. Mizrahi Jewish cuisine has many unique dishes that were eaten by Jews in Iraq, Eastern Turkey, Iran and Yemen.

==Shabbat and holiday dishes==

===Shabbat===

Good food is an important part of the &quot;mitzvah&quot; of &quot;oneg Shabbat&quot; (&quot;enjoying Shabbat&quot;), hence much of Jewish cuisine revolves around Shabbat.

As observant Jews do not cook on Shabbat, various techniques were developed to provide for a hot meal on Shabbat day.

One such dish is &quot;cholent&quot; or &quot;chamin&quot;, a slow-cooked meat stew with many variations. The ingredients are placed in a pot and put up to boil before lighting the candles on Friday evening. Then the pot is placed on a hotplate, traditional &quot;blech&quot; (thin tin sheet used to cover the flames and on which the pot is placed), or in a slow oven and left to simmer until the following day.

&quot;Cholent&quot; emerged in ancient Judea, possibly as far back as the Second Temple period. Over the centuries, as Jewish diaspora communities developed, they created variations of the dish based on the local climate and available ingredients.

A prominent feature of Shabbat cookery is the preparation of twists of bread, known as &quot;challot&quot; or (in southern Germany, Austria and Hungary) &quot;barches&quot;. They are often covered with seeds to represent manna, which fell in a double portion on the sixth day.

Another Shabbat dish is calf&#x27;s foot jelly, called &quot;p&#x27;tsha&quot; or &quot;šaltiena&quot; in Lithuania and &quot;galarita&quot;, &quot;galer&quot;, &quot;galleh&quot;, or &quot;fisnoge&quot; in Poland. Beef or calf bones are put up to boil with water, seasonings, garlic and onions for a long time. It is then allowed to cool. The broth then jells into a semi-solid mass, which is served in cubes.

&quot;Drelies,&quot; a similar dish originating in south Russia and Galicia is mixed with soft-boiled eggs and vinegar when removed from the oven and served hot. In Romania it is called &quot;piftie&quot;, in Serbia &quot;pihtije&quot;; it is served cold, with garlic, hard-boiled eggs and vinegar sauce or mustard creme and considered a traditional dish in the winter season.

&quot;Kugel&quot; is another Shabbat favorite, particularly &quot;lokshen kugel,&quot; a sweet baked noodle pudding, often with raisins and spices. Non-sweet kugels may be made of potatoes, carrots or a combination of vegetables.

Among the Jewish communities of Libya, Italy and a number of other communities in the Mediterranean basin, they used to prepare a rich selection of desserts that can be prepared even on Pesach without the need for leaven so that it can be served both on Pesach and on the day of Passover, which was spoken by the Sephardic Jews and the Mizrahi Jews on the day of Mimona, which is also considered a holiday. Among these foods are the abambar, buca de dama.

Traditional noodles—&quot;lokshen&quot;—are made from a dough of flour and eggs rolled into sheets and then cut into long strips. If the dough is cut into small squares, it becomes &quot;farfel.&quot; Both &quot;lokshen&quot; and &quot;farfel&quot; are usually boiled and served with soup.

===Rosh Hashanah===
On Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, several symbolic foods called are prepared and eaten for a variety of different reasons, each unique to the dish. All of the ingredients within the dishes are kosher, which means they follow the laws of kashrut, the Hebrew word for correct.

The majority of the dishes are sweetened to represent a prayer for a sweet (pleasant) new year. Such sweet dishes include apples that are either baked or covered in honey, &quot;lekach&quot; (honey cake) and &quot;makroudh&quot; (a pastry that is filled with dates and covered with honey).

Dates, symbolizing the end, can also be eaten by themselves to encourage the enemies to meet their end. The value of the date can be traced back to biblical times, when the palm date is mentioned multiple times within the Bible itself, but also with how valuable dates were as an export.

Pomegranate seeds are eaten for a year of many blessings, because there are many seeds inside of a single pomegranate. Specifically, there are thought to be 613 seeds inside of a pomegranate, each one representing one of the Torah&#x27;s 613 commandments.

The traditional value placed on pomegranates and their consumption is derived from their mention in the Bible when its discovery by one of Moses&#x27;s spies concluded that there was fertility in the land of the unknown.

Challah bread is baked into a round, circular shape that is meant to represent the cyclical nature of life and the crown. It is also sweetened with either honey or a combination of cinnamon and sugar instead of being dipped into the usual kosher salt.

&quot;Tzimmes&quot;, a side dish composed traditionally of sweetened carrots or yams, are served to symbolize prosperity, because of the double meaning of Yiddish word &quot;meren&quot;, which represents &quot;to multiply&quot; and &quot;carrot&quot;.

Additional symbolic foods include:

*&quot;Teiglach&quot;, knotted pastries boiled in a honeyed syrup (for Ashkenazi Jews).
*Head of a fish or a ram, for a successful year in which we are the &quot;head&quot;, not the &quot;tail&quot; (because Rosh Hashanah begins the year, it is referred to as the head).
*Fried leek cutlets, called &quot;karteh&quot; (for Sephardic Jews).
*Fried chard cutlets, called &quot;salkeh&quot; (for Sephardic Jews).
*Local type of zucchini called &quot;qara&#x27;a&quot;, made into sweet confiture (for Sephardic Jews).• Algerian Jews serve a honey-dipped date pastry called &quot;makroudh&quot;.

===Yom Kippur===
Yom Kippur is a fast day. The pre-fast meal, called &quot;seuda hamafseket&quot;, usually consists of foods that are digested slowly and are not highly spiced, to make fasting easier and prevent thirst.

===Sukkot===

On Sukkot meals are eaten outside in the &quot;sukkah&quot;, a thatched hut built specially for the holiday. Often fresh fruits are eaten also, which are woven into the roof of the thatched hut.

===Hanukkah===

It is customary to eat foods fried in oil to celebrate Hanukkah. Eating dairy products was a custom in medieval times.
*&quot;Latkes&quot;—potato pancakes, may be topped with sour cream or applesauce (Ashkenazi food)
*Sufganiyot—jam doughnuts (Ashkenazi, popular in Israel)
*Fried doughnuts with grounded sugar sprinkled on top, called &quot;sfinge&quot; (mainly by North African Jews) or &quot;zalabiyeh&quot;.
*&quot;Rugelach&quot;—filled pastry.

===Purim===
*&quot;Hamantaschen&quot;—triangular pastries traditionally filled with poppy seeds or prunes
*Couscous—a Berber dish of small steamed balls of crushed durum wheat semolina traditionally served with a stew spooned on top • &quot;Fazuelos&quot;—Sephardic pastries of thin fried dough
*&quot;Ma&#x27;amoul&quot;—shortbread pastries filled with dates or nuts

===Passover===
Passover celebrates The Exodus from Egypt where it is said the Jewish people left so quickly, there was no time for their bread to rise. Commemorating this event, Jews eat matza and abstain from bread, cakes and other foods made with yeast and leavening agents. In modern times, rabbinical authorities permit the use of chemical leavening, such as baking powder.

Matza is a staple food during the holiday and used as an ingredient of many Passover dishes. &quot;Kneidlach&quot; (matza ball) soup is traditional. Fish is coated with matza meal before frying and cakes and puddings are made with potato starch and matza meal.

Jewish cooks use both matza meal and potato starch for pastries during Passover. Whisked whole eggs or egg whites are frequently used to make pastries without leavening agents, such as angel and sponge cakes (potato starch replacing cake flour) and coconut and almond macaroons.
Passover foods vary distinctly between Sephardic and Ashkenazic communities. Ashkenazim exclude rice, while it is served by Sephardim. Matza is traditionally prepared from water and flour only, but there are other varieties, such as egg matza, which may also contain fruit juice.

At the seder, it is customary in some communities, particularly among strictly Orthodox Jews, to use handmade , which has undergone particularly strict &quot;kashrut&quot; supervision.

The exclusion of leaven from the home has forced Jewish cooks to be creative, producing a wide variety of Passover dishes that use matza meal and potato as thickeners. Potato flour is largely used in cakes along with finely ground matza meal and nuts.

Popular Ashkenazi dishes are &quot;matza brei&quot; (crumbled matza with grated onion, fried with scrambled egg), &quot;matza latkes&quot; (pancakes) and &quot;chremslach&quot; (also called &quot;crimsel&quot; or &quot;gresjelies,&quot; matza meal fritters). Wined &quot;matza kugels&quot; (pudding) have been introduced into modern Jewish cooking.

For thickening soups and sauces at Passover fine matza meal or potato flour is used instead of flour, for frying fish or cutlets a coating of matza meal and egg, and for stuffing potatoes instead of soaked bread.

&quot;Noodles&quot; may be made by making pancakes with beaten eggs and matza meal which, when cooked, are rolled up and cut into strips. They may be dropped into soup before serving. (dumplings) are small balls made from suet mixed with chopped fried onions, chopped parsley, beaten egg and seasonings, dropped into soup and cooked.

Wine is also an important part of Passover meals. Traditionally, a Passover seder is served with four cups of wine or grape juice, to be consumed along with various parts of the seder. Kosher wine is typically consumed for Passover.

===Shavuot===
Dairy foods are traditionally eaten on Shavuot.
*Cheesecake

===Tisha B&#x27;Av===
Tisha B&#x27;av is a fast day, preceded by nine days when Jews traditionally do not eat meat, except on Shabbat. Thus dairy and vegetarian dishes are prepared during this time of year.

The meal before the fast (the ) also consists of dairy foods and usually contains dishes made from lentils and eggs, both ancient Jewish symbols of mourning. Some Ashkenazi Jews eat hard-boiled eggs sprinkled with &quot;ashes&quot; (pepper) to symbolize mourning.

<doc id="1290527" wikidata="Q387559" url="?curid=1290527" title="House of Golitsyn">
<text>The House of Golitsyn (, ) is the second largest and noblest Princely house in Russia. Among its members were warlords, landlords, knyazes (princes), knights, diplomats, Prime Ministers, admirals, stewards, State Counsellors and statesmen. 

The Golitsyns claim their seniority in the Lithuanian dynasty of Gediminas (the Gediminids) which has existed since the 13th century. Descendants of this family in Europe and the west write their name in the form &quot;Galitzine&quot;. The family is among the first Russian aristocratic dynasties and its members bear the honorific predicate His Serene Highness. 

The family produced many well-known statesmen and figures of the Russian Empire, among them notably Vasily, Boris, Dmitry and Nikolai Golitsyn, the last chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire.

Numerous pieces of art or geographic locations were named after the family, such as the Galitzin Triptych created by Pietro Perugino in 1485 or the Galitzine Quartet No. 12 commissioned by Nikolai Galitzin and delivered by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1825, the Golitsyn craters A and B on the far side of the Moon, the Gallitzinberg, in Vienna, the Gallitzin borough in Pennsylvania, the Gallitzin Tunnel and Gallitzin State Forest, the Golitsyn Hospital in Moscow and various places, localities and municipalities in Russia.

==Origins==

According to legend, the family descends from Lithuanian prince Jurgis (George), son of Patrikas and grandson of Narimantas and thus a great-grandson of Gediminas (), Grand Duke of Lithuania. After the extinction of the Korecki family in the 17th century, the Golitsyns claimed dynastic seniority in the House of Gediminas.

Prince George immigrated to the court of Vasily I of Moscow and married Vasily&#x27;s sister. His children and grandchildren, among them , were considered premier Russian boyars. One of them, Prince , grandson of Yuriy, earned the nickname &quot;Golitsa&quot; after the gauntlet () he wore only on one hand. His son Yuri Mikhailovich Bulgakov continued with the family line Golytsin and his great-grandson Prince Vasily Golitsyn was claimant to the Russian throne during the Time of Troubles and went as an ambassador to Poland to offer the Russian crown to Prince Władysław; he died in prison.

Peter I of Russia permitted the Golitsyns to incorporate the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into their coat of arms; “Vir est Vis”, or &quot;man himself is power”, is the Golitsyn family motto.

== Notable Golitsyns ==
 



Prince (&quot;knyaz&quot;) Andrey Andreyevich Golitsyn (), governor of Siberia (1633–1635), was the ancestor of all existing princes Golitsyns. He had four sons, from whom four branches of the Golitsyn family descended:
*Vasily (1618–1652) – branch Vasilyevich
*Ivan () – branch Ivanovich, which ended in 1751 in a monastery
*Alexey (1632–1694) – branch Alexeevich
*Michael (1639–1687) – branch Mikhailovich
By the 18th century, the family was divided into four major branches. One branch died out while the other three and their subdivisions contained about 1,100 members.

===Branch Vasilyevich===
* Vasily Vasilyevich Golitsyn (1643–1714) was a leading boyar, a Russian statesman, combining military duties with civilian pursuits, de facto head of the government during the regency of Sophia Alekseyevna (1682–1689) over her brother Ivan and half-brother Peter the Great who banished him and his family to Arkhangelsk Oblast. He owned a richly decorated mansion in Moscow which became the location of the State Duma.
** Aleksey Vasilyevich Golitsyn (1665–1740) In 1683, he received from his grandfather a village south of Moscow, now Tsaritsyno Palace and surrounding park. In 1694 he was stripped of his boyardom (with the retention of the princely title) and the Tsar sent him and his family into exile. He returned in 1726, after the death of Peter I. 
*** Mikhail Alekseyevich Golitsyn (1687–1775) nicknamed &quot;the fool&quot; was punished by Empress Anna of Russia for converting to Catholicism in order to marry an Italian or German woman. This marriage was declared illegal and she appointed him court jester in 1738, serving kvass to the guests. Two years later she forced him to marry either a Kalmuck or a female jester from Kamchatka. The &quot;mock wedding&quot; which took place inside a two-room ice palace on the Neva in February 1740 during an extremely cold winter remained famous. He moved to his estate and was buried near Pushkino.
*** Sergei Alekseyevich Golitsyn (1695–1758), served as the Moscow governor, director of the Moscow Mint. 
**** Nikolai Sergeyevich Golitsyn (1712–1773)
***** Alexander Nikolayevich Golitsyn (1773–1844), was a lifelong bachelor, homosexual and reactionary minister of education in the government of Alexander I. He headed an investigation into masonic involvement in the Decembrist uprising of 1825 and served as the Chairman of the State Council from 1838 to 1841; retired to his Crimean estate in Neo-Gothic style.
****Aleksey Sergeyevich Golitsyn (1723–1765) was the ancestor of Nikolai Dmitriyevich Golitsyn, the last prime minister of Imperial Russia.

===Branch Alexeevich===
* Aleksey Andreyevich Golitsyn (1632–1694), governor of Siberia, of Kiev.
** Boris Alekseyevich Golitsyn (1654–1714), a cousin and the chief political opponent of Vasily Vasilyevich, was tutor and participated in the coup that placed Peter the Great on the throne; head of the government during the &quot;Great Embassy&quot; of 1697–98; owner of the estates Bolshiye Vyazyomy and Dubrovitsy. 
*** Vasili Borisovich Golitsyn (1681–1710) inherited the estate, but died when the ceiling came down.
**** Mikhail Vasilievich Golitsyn (1702–1749)
***** Nikolay Mikhailovich Golitsyn (1729–1799) became the new owner of Bolshiye Vyazyomy in 1766. 
**** Boris Vasilievich Golitsyn (1705–1769), admiral
***** Vladimir Borisovich Golitsyn (1731–1798) was a Russian statesman; his wife Natalya Golitsyna was known as a learned woman, a gambler and a good dancer. She served Catherine the Great and was characterized in The Queen of Spades (story). In 1783 she moved with her daughters Ekaterina and Sophie to Paris and visited her sons; all the Golitsyns returned to Russia in 1791.
****** Boris Vladimirovich Golitsyn (1769–1813) was a Russian aristocrat who received his education in Strasbourg (1782), and attended the École militaire in Paris (1786).

<text>The walrus moustache is characterized by whiskers that are thick, bushy, and drop over the mouth. The style resembles the whiskers of a walrus, hence the name.

== History ==

An ethnic trait of Celts and Gauls, but strongly present in the Polish Sarmatian culture as well, the walrus moustache enjoyed immense popularity among men in the latter part of the 19th and early years of the 20th centuries. Gentlemen ranging from scientists to philosophers to politicians often favored the rugged look that the style created.

After falling out of favor in the 1920s it enjoyed a temporary resurgence during the youth counterculture revolution of the 1960s.

In Poland, the moustache became a symbol of nobility and traditionalism. From the 16th to the 20th century it was a symbol of Polish patriotism and sarmatism. Notable bearers at the time were King John III Sobieski in the 17th century, Langiewicz in the 19th century and Piłsudski in the 20th century.

Friedrich Nietzsche also styled his moustache to be Polish, as he claimed Polish heritage in several of his books.

== Styles ==
In some instances, the facial hair of the walrus moustache not only drops over the mouth but also extends downward at each corner. The hairline may wrap around the cheeks and connect to sideburns the same thickness, as worn by the man they are named for, Ambrose Burnside.

Many men throughout history have sported a walrus moustache. In Germany, the walrus is commonly associated with Reichskanzler Otto von Bismarck. Other men include actor Wilford Brimley, Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid, American president Theodore Roosevelt, former United States National Security Advisor and United States Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, American author Mark Twain, rock musician David Crosby, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Polish politicians Józef Piłsudski and Lech Wałęsa, former professional hockey player Lanny McDonald, musician John Lennon, actor Stephen Fry, actor Sam Elliott and Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, who at times also wore the handlebar moustache. Jamie Hyneman of &quot;MythBusters&quot; is also known for his walrus moustache, a common source of humor with his co-host Adam Savage.

<text>Louisville Baseball Park (or Grounds) was a baseball park located in Louisville, Kentucky. The park was home to the Louisville Grays of the National League from 1876 to 1877.

The field was located within a large block bounded by 4th Street (east); Hill Street (south); 6th Street (west); and Magnolia Avenue (north). The block was across the street to the south of Central Park, which still exists, and was also adjacent to a field used by the amateur Louisville Eagles.

A few years after the breakup of the club following the 1877 Louisville Grays scandal, the large block was redeveloped for other purposes. It was the home of the Southern Exposition from 1883 through 1887. By the 1890s, the large block had been cut into lots and developed into an upper-class neighborhood known as St. James Court.

<text>Feroxyhyte is an oxide/hydroxide of iron, δ-Fe3+O(OH). Feroxyhyte crystallizes in the hexagonal system. It forms as brown rounded to concretionary masses. Feroxyhyte is opaque, magnetic, has a yellow streak, and has a relative density of 4.2.

It occurs in manganese-iron nodules on the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean floors. It is also found in the Baltic, White, and Kara Seas. Forms under high pressure conditions and reverts to goethite on exposure to surface conditions. It also occurs as cement and coatings on clasts in poorly drained soils and sediments, formed by the rapid oxidation of iron(II) oxide compounds.

It was first described in 1976 for an occurrence in soils at its type locality: Kolomyya, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine.

<text>Maksimilijan &quot;Maxo&quot; Vanka (May 11, 1889 – February 2, 1963) was a Croatian-American artist. He is best known for the series of murals he completed in 1937 and 1941 at St. Nicholas Croatian Church in Millvale, Pennsylvania.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Vanka was born in Zagreb in 1889 as the illegitimate son of two Austro-Hungarian noble families. To avoid a scandal, he was given to a peasant woman in the village of Kupljenovo who raised him for the first few years of his life. However, at the age of eight, his maternal grandfather learned of his existence and had him sent away to a castle where he had access to an upper-class education.

He studied art under Bela Čikoš Sesija at the College of Arts and Crafts in Zagreb as well as in Brussels with Jean Delville and Constant Montald. During World War I, he served with the Belgian Red Cross, because he was a pacifist and would not serve in the regular army. After the war, he returned to teach at the College of Arts and Crafts, becoming a professor in 1923. He taught composition, drawing and fresco work. He was elected as a corresponding member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1929. In 1931 he married an American, Margaret Stetten, whom he met while she was traveling in the Balkans with her parents. The couple moved to New York City with their daughter Peggy in 1935.

===Millvale murals===
After moving to the United States, Vanka exhibited his work in New York and Pittsburgh, but without much financial success. In 1937, his friend Louis Adamic helped him get the commission for what would end up being his most important work, a series of murals for St. Nicholas Church, a Croatian parish in the Pittsburgh suburb of Millvale, Pennsylvania. Working in two campaigns, the first in 1937 and the second in 1941, Vanka painted a total of 25 fresco murals on the apse, walls, and ceiling of the church, covering a total area of approximately . 

Vanka painted the first set of murals from April to June, 1937, working every day until 2 or 3 in the morning. During this time, he became convinced that the church was haunted by a ghostly, black-robed figure, which Adamic later wrote about in a piece for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; titled &quot;The Millvale Apparition&quot;. Nevertheless, he completed the murals on schedule. Although Vanka had &quot;upset tradition in his introduction of labor scenes... within the sacred precincts of a church&quot;, the murals were met with acclaim from the press as well as church officials, and brought Vanka &quot;significant if not prolonged fame.&quot;

Vanka was invited back to complete a second set of murals which were dedicated on November 16, 1941. With World War II then raging in Europe, these murals featured much more overtly anti-war subject matter than the earlier ones. With the completion of the full set of murals, the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; wrote that the artwork would &quot;put [the church] near the top of the &#x27;must list&#x27; of places to see in the Pittsburgh district&quot;, while the &quot;Sun-Telegraph&quot; wrote that Vanka and the parish priest, Albert Zagar, were &quot;tossing the dogmas of religious art into the ash-can&quot;. Vanka himself described the murals as &quot;my contribution to America&quot;. 
The subject matter of the murals includes a combination of traditional religious imagery and social themes related to the Croatian American experience, such as war, injustice, and exploitation of workers. Vanka acknowledged traditional church decoration practices dating back to the Byzantine Empire in his placement of Mary, Queen of Heaven, above the altar and depictions of the Ascension of Jesus and the Four Evangelists on the ceiling. Elsewhere, Vanka included scenes from the Old and New Testaments, images of saints, and scenes depicting the Croatian immigrant experience such as &quot;Immigrant Mother Raises Her Sons for American Industry&quot;, in which a group of Croatian women mourn over a young man killed in a mining accident. Other murals included allegorical depictions of injustice and inequality in America, such as &quot;The American Capitalist&quot;, in which a wealthy businessman sits before an elaborate meal while ignoring a beggar, and &quot;Injustice&quot;, which depicts a hooded figure wearing a gas mask and holding a scale in which a loaf of bread is outweighed by gold. Vanka, a committed pacifist, also included strong anti-war imagery, such as a crucified Jesus being pierced by a World War I soldier&#x27;s bayonet, and the Virgin Mary breaking a soldier&#x27;s rifle.

===Later career and death===
Apart from the Millvale murals, the majority of Vanka&#x27;s American work consisted of charcoal and pastel drawings, many of which depicted scenes and people he met during his travels, and oil paintings, which were predominantly landscapes and still lifes. Vanka mostly stopped exhibiting his work after World War II, although he did hold a small show consisting of &quot;fruits, flowers, and allegorical landscapes&quot; at the Charles Barzansky gallery in New York in 1957. As a result of this limited exposure, most of his later work is not well known.

In his later life, Vanka lived on a farm near Doylestown in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and taught art appreciation at the National Agricultural College (now Delaware Valley University). He died swimming off the coast of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in 1963.

==Legacy==
In 1968, Vanka&#x27;s widow and daughter donated 47 of his works to the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. This collection was initially displayed at Vanka&#x27;s former summer home on the island of Korčula, but was later moved to the Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters in Zagreb. In 2022, it was announced that the collection would be restored and moved back to Vanka&#x27;s villa on Korčula.

Vanka and his work were largely forgotten in the United States after his death, but began to attract renewed attention since the 1990s. His first U.S. retrospective was held in 2001 at the James A. Michener Art Museum in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. In 1991, the Society to Preserve the Millvale Murals of Maxo Vanka was founded with the mission to preserve and maintain the murals at St. Nicholas Church. SPMMMV is leading a campaign to clean, restore and light the murals, and offers docent-led tours every Saturday at 11:00 and 12:30.

Vanka was mentioned in several writings by Louis Adamic and was the inspiration for his 1936 novel &quot;Cradle of Life: The Story of One Man&#x27;s Beginnings&quot;. The novel tells the story of a man named Rudo Stanka whose early life mirrors Vanka&#x27;s own. Vanka was also memorialized in &quot;Gift to America&quot;, a play written in 1981 by Professor David P. Demarest of Carnegie Mellon University.

On Easter Sunday 2012 the Pittsburgh-based band Action Camp released a short film setting one of their live performances of a musical suite against the Maxo Vanka murals that inspired it. This is one of only two performances of this work, that was performed in front of the Millvale Murals in the St. Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church. The band was commissioned to perform this suite in a collaboration called Hi-Rez.

He educate and learned Ambroz Testen watercolor painting techniques and he left great influence on his painting later.

<doc id="1290555" wikidata="Q1122220" url="?curid=1290555" title="Computer-assisted telephone interviewing">
<text>Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) is a telephone surveying technique in which the interviewer follows a script provided by a software application. It is a structured system of microdata collection by telephone that speeds up the collection and editing of microdata and also permits the interviewer to educate the respondents on the importance of timely and accurate data. The software is able to customize the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information already known about the participant. It is used in B2B services and corporate sales.

CATI may function in the following manner:

* A computerized questionnaire is administered to respondents over the telephone.
* The interviewer sits in front of a computer screen.
* Upon command, the computer dials the telephone number to be called.
* When contact is made, the interviewer reads the questions posed on the computer screen and records the respondent&#x27;s answers directly into the computer.
* Interim and update reports can be compiled instantaneously, as the data are being collected.
* CATI software has built-in logic, which also enhances data accuracy.
* The program will personalize questions and control for logically incorrect answers, such as percentage answers that do not add up to 100 percent.
* The software has built-in branching logic, which will skip questions that are not applicable or will probe for more detail when warranted.
* Automated dialers are usually deployed to lower the waiting time for the interviewer, as well as to record the interview for quality purposes.

==Automated computer telephone interviewing==
Automated computer telephone interviewing (ACTI) is a technique by which a computer with speaker-independent voice recognition capabilities asks respondents a series of questions, recognizes then stores the answers, and is able to follow scripted logic and branch intelligently according to the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information known about the participant. This technique is also referred to as interactive voice response (IVR).

<doc id="1290557" wikidata="Q7180943" url="?curid=1290557" title="Phase correlation">
<text>Phase correlation is an approach to estimate the relative translative offset between two similar images (digital image correlation) or other data sets. It is commonly used in image registration and relies on a frequency-domain representation of the data, usually calculated by fast Fourier transforms. The term is applied particularly to a subset of cross-correlation techniques that isolate the phase information from the Fourier-space representation of the cross-correlogram.

== Example ==
The following image demonstrates the usage of phase correlation to determine relative translative movement between two images corrupted by independent Gaussian noise. The image was translated by (30,33) pixels. Accordingly, one can clearly see a peak in the phase-correlation representation at approximately (30,33).

== Method ==
Given two input images formula_1 and formula_2:

Apply a window function (e.g., a Hamming window) on both images to reduce edge effects (this may be optional depending on the image characteristics). Then, calculate the discrete 2D Fourier transform of both images.

:formula_3

Calculate the cross-power spectrum by taking the complex conjugate of the second result, multiplying the Fourier transforms together elementwise, and normalizing this product elementwise.

:formula_4

Where formula_5 is the Hadamard product (entry-wise product) and the absolute values are taken entry-wise as well. Written out entry-wise for element index formula_6:

:formula_7

Obtain the normalized cross-correlation by applying the inverse Fourier transform.

:formula_8

Determine the location of the peak in formula_9.

:formula_10

Commonly, interpolation methods are used to estimate the peak location in the cross-correlogram to non-integer values, despite the fact that the data are discrete, and this procedure is often termed &#x27;subpixel registration&#x27;. A large variety of subpixel interpolation methods are given in the technical literature. Common peak interpolation methods such as parabolic interpolation have been used, and the OpenCV computer vision package uses a centroid-based method, though these generally have inferior accuracy compared to more sophisticated methods.

Because the Fourier representation of the data has already been computed, it is especially convenient to use the Fourier shift theorem with real-valued (sub-integer) shifts for this purpose, which essentially interpolates using the sinusoidal basis functions of the Fourier transform. An especially popular FT-based estimator is given by Foroosh &quot;et al.&quot; In this method, the subpixel peak location is approximated by a simple formula involving peak pixel value and the values of its nearest neighbors, where formula_11 is the peak value and formula_12 is the nearest neighbor in the x direction (assuming, as in most approaches, that the integer shift has already been found and the comparand images differ only by a subpixel shift).

:formula_13

The Foroosh &quot;et al.&quot; method is quite fast compared to most methods, though it is not always the most accurate. Some methods shift the peak in Fourier space and apply non-linear optimization to maximize the correlogram peak, but these tend to be very slow since they must apply an inverse Fourier transform or its equivalent in the objective function.

It is also possible to infer the peak location from phase characteristics in Fourier space without the inverse transformation, as noted by Stone. These methods usually use a linear least squares (LLS) fit of the phase angles to a planar model. The long latency of the phase angle computation in these methods is a disadvantage, but the speed can sometimes be comparable to the Foroosh &quot;et al.&quot; method depending on the image size. They often compare favorably in speed to the multiple iterations of extremely slow objective functions in iterative non-linear methods.

Since all subpixel shift computation methods are fundamentally interpolative, the performance of a particular method depends on how well the underlying data conform to the assumptions in the interpolator. This fact also may limit the usefulness of high numerical accuracy in an algorithm, since the uncertainty due to interpolation method choice may be larger than any numerical or approximation error in the particular method.

Subpixel methods are also particularly sensitive to noise in the images, and the utility of a particular algorithm is distinguished not only by its speed and accuracy but its resilience to the particular types of noise in the application.

== Rationale ==
The method is based on the Fourier shift theorem.

Let the two images formula_1 and formula_2 be circularly-shifted versions of each other:

:formula_16

(where the images are formula_17 in size).

Then, the discrete Fourier transforms of the images will be shifted relatively in phase:

:formula_18

One can then calculate the normalized cross-power spectrum to factor out the phase difference:

:formula_19
since the magnitude of an imaginary exponential always is one, and the phase of formula_20 always is zero.

The inverse Fourier transform of a complex exponential is a Dirac delta function, i.e. a single peak:

:formula_21

This result could have been obtained by calculating the cross correlation directly. The advantage of this method is that the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse can be performed using the fast Fourier transform, which is much faster than correlation for large images.

=== Benefits ===
Unlike many spatial-domain algorithms, the phase correlation method is resilient to noise, occlusions, and other defects typical of medical or satellite images.

The method can be extended to determine rotation and scaling differences between two images by first converting the images to log-polar coordinates. Due to properties of the Fourier transform, the rotation and scaling parameters can be determined in a manner invariant to translation.

=== Limitations ===

In practice, it is more likely that formula_2 will be a simple linear shift of formula_1, rather than a circular shift as required by the explanation above. In such cases, formula_9 will not be a simple delta function, which will reduce the performance of the method. In such cases, a window function (such as a Gaussian or Tukey window) should be employed during the Fourier transform to reduce edge effects, or the images should be zero padded so that the edge effects can be ignored. If the images consist of a flat background, with all detail situated away from the edges, then a linear shift will be equivalent to a circular shift, and the above derivation will hold exactly. The peak can be sharpened by using edge or vector correlation.

For periodic images (such as a chessboard or picket fence), phase correlation may yield ambiguous results with several peaks in the resulting output.

== Applications ==
Phase correlation is the preferred method for television standards conversion, as it leaves the fewest artifacts.

<doc id="1290558" wikidata="Q4706256" url="?curid=1290558" title="Victor Brooke, 3rd Viscount Alanbrooke">
<text>Alan Victor Harold Brooke, 3rd Viscount Alanbrooke (24 November 1932 – 10 January 2018), was a British hereditary peer.

==Early life and education==
Known to his family and friends as Victor, Lord Alanbrooke was the younger son of Field Marshal Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke and his second wife, Benita Pelly.

He was educated at Harrow and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, from where he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1952.

==Career==
Alanbrooke gave up his British Army career in 1972, having risen only to the rank of captain. On 19 December 1972, upon the death of his elder half-brother Thomas Brooke, 2nd Viscount Alanbrooke, he succeeded to the viscountcy and to a seat in the House of Lords. In 1973, he went up to Bristol University and, in 1976, graduated as a Bachelor of Education (BEd) and earned Qualified Teacher Status.

==Interests==
In his recreations in &quot;Debrett&#x27;s&quot;, Alanbrooke listed &quot;enjoying post-Lloyd&#x27;s poverty, rearranging the wreckage for remaining family.&quot; He was a keen walker and spent most summers hiking the Cornish Coastal Path, alternating each time between a clockwise or anti-clockwise route to ensure, he said, &quot;That my face rusts evenly on both sides&quot;.

==Death==
Lord Alanbrooke lived in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, where his father is buried. He died on 10 January 2018 at the age of 85 and his funeral took place at St Eligius Church, Arborfield. He was unmarried. As there were no further male line heirs of the 1st Viscount, the viscountcy and the subsidiary title of Baron Alanbrooke became extinct upon his death.

<text>Moonbabies is a Swedish bubblegum pop duo formed in 1997 by Ola Frick (Vocals, guitar and various instruments) and Carina Johansson (Vocals and keyboards).

==History==
The duo formed in 1997. Their debut album &quot;June and Novas&quot; was released in 2000 and they went on a U.S. tour in the spring of 2001. Their second album was released in 2004 and was followed by a European tour in 2004. After the release the album &quot;Moonbabies at the Ballroom&quot; in 2007, they went on hiatus until 2015 when they released Wizards on the Beach. Their music was shoegaze inspired but later progressed into a more pop and electronic sound.

<doc id="1290563" wikidata="Q5333021" url="?curid=1290563" title="Eclipse Park">
<text>Eclipse Park was the name of three successive baseball grounds in Louisville, Kentucky in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were the home of the Louisville baseball team first known as the Louisville Eclipse and later as the Louisville Colonels.

The unusual name for these ballparks derived from the original name of the Association club, the Eclipse. The more local name &quot;Colonels&quot; eventually won out. Nonetheless, &quot;Eclipse&quot; was among the early team names to be a singular word, despite &quot;sounding like&quot; a plural.

Semi-pro baseball had been played at the first Eclipse Park as early as 1874. The Louisville Eclipse played there from 1882 to 1884. The team was then renamed the Louisville Colonels and continued to play under that name from 1885 to 1893. The team was a member of the American Association until 1891 when it joined the National League when the American Association folded. The park was destroyed by fire on September 27, 1892. The 1893 season started in what was left of the park.

The original Eclipse Park was located at 28th and Elliott streets in west Louisville.

The second Eclipse Park was built a block south of the original. City directories and local newspapers give the location as 28th Street (east) and Broadway (north). The Louisville Colonels played there from early in the 1893 season until well into the 1899 season. This is the ground at which Hall of Famer Honus Wagner made his Major League debut on July 19, 1897.

The second Eclipse Park was destroyed by fire on August 12, 1899. The club was on a road trip at the time. They returned to a partially-rebuilt park ten days later, but the stands were inadequate and the club played the final month as a road team.

The fire contributed significantly to the once-strong Louisville club being contracted after the end of the season. Team owner Barney Dreyfuss moved on to acquire the Pittsburgh Pirates. Instead of being scattered to the wind, the best players from the Louisville team roster were brought onto the Pittsburgh payroll, including Wagner, third baseman Tommy Leach, outfielder-manager Fred Clarke, and ace right-hander Deacon Phillippe. This influx of talent soon turned the perennial cellar-dwelling Pirates into a three-peat pennant winner, and a participant in the first modern World Series.

After a one-year absence of professional ball, a Louisville Colonels entry in the Western Association opened at the remnants of the park in 1901. The club drew poorly and transferred to Grand Rapids, Michigan near the end of June.
The third and final Eclipse Park was built on a block bounded by 7th Street (east); Kentucky Street (south); 8th Street (west); and Florence Place (north) in the Limerick neighborhood of Louisville. This ballpark was built by George &quot;White Wings&quot; Tebeau as the home for the American Association minor league Louisville Colonels who played there from 1902 through 1922.

The final Eclipse Park had better luck than the first two, remaining in operation for more than twenty years, until it too was destroyed by fire, on November 21, 1922.

All three Eclipse Park locations had been destroyed by fire of various origins. The Louisville &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; covered each of these events in the days following. After the 1922 fire, the paper editorialized that wooden ballparks were obsolete and should be replaced by steel and concrete. The ball club followed that advice, opening Parkway Field the following spring.

<doc id="1290566" wikidata="Q444908" url="?curid=1290566" title="Stede Bonnet">
<text>Stede Bonnet (c. 1688 – 10 December 1718) was an English pirate who was known as the Gentleman Pirate because he was a moderately wealthy landowner before turning to a life of crime. Bonnet was born into a wealthy English family on the island of Barbados, and inherited the family estate after his father&#x27;s death in 1694. Despite his lack of sailing experience, Bonnet decided he should turn to piracy in the spring of 1717. He bought a sailing vessel, the &quot;Revenge&quot;, and travelled with his paid crew along the Eastern Seaboard of what is now the United States, capturing other vessels and burning other Barbadian ships. 

Bonnet set sail for Nassau in the Bahamas, to the haven for pirates known as the &quot;Republic of Pirates&quot;, but he was seriously wounded &quot;en route&quot; during an encounter with a Spanish warship. After arriving in Nassau, Bonnet met the infamous pirate Blackbeard. Incapable of leading his crew, Bonnet temporarily ceded his ship&#x27;s command to Blackbeard. Before separating in December 1717, Blackbeard and Bonnet plundered and captured merchant ships along the East Coast. After Bonnet failed to capture the &quot;Protestant Caesar&quot;, his crew abandoned him to join Blackbeard aboard the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Bonnet stayed on Blackbeard&#x27;s ship as a guest, and did not command a crew again until summer 1718, when he was pardoned by North Carolina governor Charles Eden and received clearance to undertake privateering against Spanish shipping interests. Bonnet was tempted to resume his piracy but did not want to lose his pardon, so he adopted the alias &quot;Captain Thomas&quot; and changed his ship&#x27;s name to &quot;Royal James&quot;. He had returned to piracy by July.

In August, Bonnet anchored &quot;Royal James&quot; on an estuary of the Cape Fear River to careen and repair the ship. In late August and September, Colonel William Rhett, with the authorization of South Carolina&#x27;s governor Robert Johnson, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett&#x27;s and Bonnet&#x27;s men engaged in combat for hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and brought them to Charles Town (now Charleston, South Carolina) in early October. Bonnet escaped on 24 October, but was soon recaptured on Sullivan&#x27;s Island. On 10 November, Bonnet was brought to trial and charged with two acts of piracy. Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced him to death. Bonnet wrote to Johnson to ask for clemency, but Johnson endorsed the judge&#x27;s decision, and Bonnet was hanged in Charles Town on 10 December.

==Pre-criminal life==
Stede Bonnet was born in 1688, and he was christened at Christ Church parish on 29 July 1688. His parents, Edward and Sarah Bonnet, owned an estate of over southeast of Bridgetown, Barbados, which was bequeathed to Bonnet upon his father&#x27;s death in 1694. Bonnet received a good education, and lived as one of the richest and highest members of Bridgetown society. Bonnet married Mary Allamby in Bridgetown on 21 November 1709. They had three sons – Allamby (who died by 1715), Edward, and Stede Jr – and a daughter, Mary. The three surviving children were all younger than five when their father abandoned them for piracy.

In the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, historian Robert C. Ritchie suggests that Bonnet was driven to piracy to escape his bad marriage, or to &quot;recapture his more adventurous youth&quot;. Details of Bonnet&#x27;s military service are unclear, but he held the rank of major in the Barbados militia. Bonnet&#x27;s militia service coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession, but there is no record that he took part in the fighting.

==Early career as a pirate==
During the spring of 1717, Bonnet decided to become a pirate, despite having no knowledge of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the &quot;Revenge&quot;. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny, by boarding them, or by converting a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew. In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. After staying at anchor for several days, telling inquirers that he was going to use the &quot;Revenge&quot; for island trading, Bonnet departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados, under the cover of darkness.

Bonnet&#x27;s initial cruise took him to the coast of the Colony of Virginia, near the entrance of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship &quot;Turbes&quot; to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. Finding that New York was a less profitable hunting ground, by August Bonnet had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from Boston and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian sloop to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the &quot;Revenge&quot;. After the Barbadian sloop&#x27;s tackle was used to careen the &quot;Revenge&quot;, the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were burned. In September, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. &quot;En route&quot;, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man-of-war. The &quot;Revenge&quot; was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the &quot;Revenge&quot;, increasing the sloop&#x27;s armament to twelve guns.

==Collaboration with Blackbeard==
While at Nassau, Bonnet met Captain Benjamin Hornigold and Blackbeard for the first time. Blackbeard and Bonnet struck up an unlikely friendship, and decided to cruise together, with Blackbeard taking command while Bonnet kept to his cabin, recovering from his wounds. The ship sailed northward to Delaware Bay, where they plundered eleven ships. On 29 September, the &quot;Revenge&quot;, captained by Blackbeard, plundered the sloop &quot;Betty&quot;, which had a cargo full of Madeira wine. Captain Codd, whose merchant ship was taken on 12 October, described Bonnet as walking the deck in his nightshirt, lacking any command and still unwell from his wounds. The &quot;Revenge&quot; later captured and looted the &quot;Spofford&quot; and &quot;Sea Nymph&quot;, which were leaving Philadelphia. On 22 October, the &quot;Revenge&quot; stopped and robbed the &quot;Robert&quot; and &quot;Good Intent&quot; of their supplies. On 17 November Blackbeard captured the French slave ship &quot;La Concorde&quot; which he took as his own, naming her &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Bonnet took back command of &quot;Revenge&quot;. 

Some time after 19 December, Bonnet and Blackbeard separated. Bonnet sailed into the western Caribbean. On 28 March 1718, he encountered the 400-ton merchant vessel &quot;Protestant Caesar&quot; off Honduras. The ship escaped him, and his frustrated crew became restive. When Bonnet encountered Blackbeard again shortly afterwards at Turneffe Atoll, Bonnet&#x27;s crew deserted him to join Blackbeard. Calling Bonnet on board his own ship, Blackbeard essentially imprisoned him, suggesting that as a gentleman he would prefer a life of leisure to that of command. Blackbeard put a henchman named Richards in command of the &quot;Revenge&quot;. Bonnet, surprised that his colleague had betrayed him, found himself as a guest aboard Blackbeard&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Bonnet confided in a few loyal crew members that he was ready to give up his criminal life if he could exile himself in Spain or Portugal.

Under Richards, the &quot;Revenge&quot; captured a Jamaican sloop, the &quot;Adventure&quot;, captained by David Herriot, who joined the pirates. Bonnet accompanied Blackbeard to South Carolina, where Blackbeard&#x27;s four vessels blockaded the port of Charles Town in the late spring. Needing a place to rest and refit his vessels, Blackbeard headed north to Topsail Island, where the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; ran aground and was lost in June. With dissent rising amongst the pirates, Blackbeard allowed Bonnet to take command of the &quot;Revenge&quot; again. Leaving the remaining vessels at Topsail Island, Blackbeard and Bonnet went ashore and journeyed to Bath, which was the capital of North Carolina. Once there, both men accepted pardons from Governor Charles Eden under King George&#x27;s Act of Grace, putatively on condition of their renouncing piracy forever. While Blackbeard quietly returned to Topsail Island, Bonnet stayed in Bath to get a &quot;clearance&quot; to sail the &quot;Revenge&quot; to Denmark&#x27;s Caribbean colony of St. Thomas, where he planned to buy a letter of marque and go privateering against Spanish shipping. Eden granted Bonnet this clearance.

==Resumption of pirate command==

Bonnet returned to Topsail Island to find that Blackbeard had sunk several of his pirate ships, taken all the loot, and robbed the &quot;Revenge&quot; and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, before sailing away. Bonnet then rescued seventeen pirates who had been marooned on a sand bar by Blackbeard for disagreeing with his plans.

Bonnet began to resupply the ravaged &quot;Revenge&quot;, having bumboats bring food on board from ashore. One of these informed Bonnet that Blackbeard was moored in Ocracoke Inlet with only eighteen pirates. Wanting to take revenge on Blackbeard, Bonnet set sail for Ocracoke, but missed Blackbeard&#x27;s departure by several hours. Bonnet gave chase but failed to catch the other pirate. Although Bonnet apparently never discarded his hopes of reaching St. Thomas and getting his letter of marque, Blackbeard had stolen the food and supplies he and his men needed to subsist.

Hoping to preserve his pardon while returning to his pirate ways, Bonnet adopted the alias &quot;Captain Thomas&quot; and changed the &quot;Revenge&quot;″s name to the &quot;Royal James&quot;. The name &quot;Royal James&quot; that Bonnet conferred on his sloop was possibly a reference to James Francis Edward Stuart, the son of the deposed James II of England who was at the time plotting to retake the throne of England from George I of Great Britain.

Bonnet further tried to disguise his return to piracy by engaging in a pretence of trade with the next two vessels he robbed. Soon afterward, Bonnet quit the charade of trading and reverted to naked piracy, encouraged by his crew. Cruising north to Delaware Bay, in July Bonnet pillaged several more vessels, totalling eleven since he had received his pardon. He took several prisoners, some of whom joined his pirate crew. While Bonnet set loose most of his prizes after looting them, he retained control of the last two sloops he captured.

During these operations the &quot;Royal James&quot; had begun to leak badly and was in need of careening. Bonnet sailed the ship to Cape Fear River, a well-known pirate rendezvous, to undertake repairs which were estimated to require two months of work. Shortly afterwards, a small shallop entered the river and was captured. Bonnet had the shallop broken up to help repair the &quot;Royal James&quot;. The work of careening was done, in whole or in part, by the prisoners Bonnet had captured. Bonnet threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the &quot;Royal James&quot;. Bonnet remained in the Cape Fear River, intending to wait out the hurricane season there.

==Battle of Cape Fear River==
By the end of August, news had reached Charles Town that a pirate vessel was moored in the Cape Fear River. Robert Johnson, governor of South Carolina, authorised Colonel William Rhett to lead a naval expedition against the pirates, believing that North Carolina was in league with the pirates and would not do anything if left to combat them alone. After a false start due to the appearance of another pirate ship near Charles Town, Rhett arrived at the mouth of the Cape Fear River on 26 September with two eight-gun sloops, the &quot;Henry&quot; and the &quot;Sea Nymph&quot;, and a force of 130 militia men. Bonnet sent three canoes out to Rhett&#x27;s ships and was disconcerted to learn that they were warships.

Bonnet planned to fight his way out to sea in the morning with his crew of 45. He also wrote a letter to Johnson, threatening to burn all the ships in Charles Town Harbour. At daybreak, on 27 September 1718, Bonnet set sail toward Rhett&#x27;s force, and all three sloops opened fire, initiating the Battle of Cape Fear River. Rhett sailed his two ships towards the &quot;Royal James&quot;, forcing the pirate to stay in the shallow waters along the river. &quot;Royal James&quot; soon ran aground, but in the chase so did the South Carolinian vessels. The &quot;Sea Nymph&quot; was stuck too far away to be of use, leaving only the &quot;Henry&quot; in range of the &quot;Royal James&quot;.

The battle was at a stalemate for the next five or six hours, with all the participants immobilized. Bonnet&#x27;s men had the advantage that their deck was heeled away from their opponents, giving them cover, while the &quot;Henry&quot;″s deck was tilted toward the pirates, thus exposing Rhett&#x27;s men to punishing musket volleys. Bonnet&#x27;s force suffered twelve casualties while killing ten and wounding fourteen of Rhett&#x27;s 70-man crew. Most of Bonnet&#x27;s men fought enthusiastically, challenging their enemies to board and fight hand to hand, and tying a knot in their flag as a mock signal to come aboard and render aid. Nevertheless, some of the prisoners who had been forced to join the pirate crew refused to fire on Rhett&#x27;s men, and one narrowly escaped death at Bonnet&#x27;s hands in the confusion of the engagement.

The battle was ultimately decided when the rising tide lifted Rhett&#x27;s sloops free while temporarily leaving the &quot;Royal James&quot; stranded. As the &quot;Henry&quot; closed with Bonnet&#x27;s ship, his crew demanded that he surrender. Bonnet at first refused, saying that he would blow up the ship before surrendering, and threatening to shoot any man who did. Despite this, the crew won Bonnet over and a white flag was raised. After negotiations were shouted between the two ships, Bonnet agreed to surrender unconditionally. Rhett returned to Charles Town with his prisoners and the &quot;Royal James&quot; on 3 October.

==Escape, recapture, and execution==
In Charles Town, Bonnet was separated from the bulk of his crew and held for three weeks along with his boatswain, Pell, and his sailing master, Herriot, at the home of Town Marshal Nathaniel Partridge. The remaining crew were held outside of Charles Town at the public watchhouse, due to the town lacking an actual jail. On 24 October, Bonnet and Herriot escaped, probably by colluding with local merchant Richard Tookerman. Johnson at once placed a £700 bounty on Bonnet&#x27;s head and dispatched search teams to track him down. Bonnet and Herriot, accompanied by a slave and a Native American who wanted to become pirates, obtained a boat and made for the north shore of Charles Town Harbour, but foul winds and lack of supplies forced the four of them onto Sullivan&#x27;s Island. Johnson sent a posse under Rhett to Sullivan&#x27;s Island to hunt for Bonnet.

The posse discovered Bonnet after an extensive search, and opened fire, killing Herriot and wounding the other two of Bonnet&#x27;s followers. Bonnet surrendered and was returned to Charles Town, imprisoned in a safer location. While awaiting trial, some sort of civil uprising in his support took place within the city, an event authorities would later describe as having nearly resulted in the burning of the town and the overthrow of the government. Bonnet possibly awaited his execution in the Court of Guard, a militia guardhouse in the city where the Exchange and Provost stood as of 2007.

The Vice-Admiralty judge Nicholas Trott sat in judgment on Bonnet&#x27;s crew and sentenced most of them to hang on 5 November, with Pell turning King&#x27;s evidence against his fellow pirates. They were executed on 8 November. Bonnet was brought to trial before Trott two days later, and formally charged with two acts of piracy, against the &quot;Francis&quot; and the &quot;Fortune&quot;, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Bonnet pleaded not guilty to the offences but provided little defence for his actions. On 12 November Trott sentenced Bonnet to death by hanging, using his final speech to recite Bonnet&#x27;s crimes and suggest that in the afterlife he would be &quot;in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death&quot;.

Johnson decreed that Bonnet would be executed on 10 December. While awaiting this, Bonnet wrote to Johnson, begging abjectly for clemency and promising to become a &quot;menial servant&quot; to Johnson and his government if he was spared. He sent several other letters, including to Rhett who offered to take Bonnet to England for a re-trial if Johnson allowed it. Bonnet&#x27;s visibly disintegrating mind moved many Carolinians to pity, particularly the female population, and London papers later reported that the governor delayed his execution seven times. Johnson stayed firm, and Bonnet was hanged at White Point, in Charles Town, on 10 December. After being cut down, his body was buried alongside those of his crew in nearby marshland below the low water mark. No marker was provided for the graves.

==Legacy==

===Bonnet&#x27;s authority===
The actual degree of authority any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, as he had no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains. Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in the same manner. At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own authority over his pirate crew. He told the court that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, and said he had not given them consent to rob any vessels. The court did not accept these protestations. Pell testified that Bonnet&#x27;s quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. Despite this, at Delaware Bay Bonnet ordered two of his crew to be flogged for breaches of discipline. Pirates did not lightly submit to flogging, as they resented the frequent use of this punishment in the naval and merchant services from which most of them came.

===Walking the plank===
Bonnet is alleged to have been one of the few pirates to make his prisoners walk the plank. The detailed record of his trial, however, makes no mention of this method of execution, and the historian Hugh F. Rankin argues that the idea is a modern fabrication. Marcus Rediker, Professor of History at the University of Pittsburgh, agrees that pirates were unlikely to make captives walk the plank, preferring either bloodless assaults or far more violent methods of murder.

===In popular culture===

Portrayals of Bonnet extend to video games, such as &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot; and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot;. In the 1941 film &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;, the Devil summons Bonnet to join a jury of the damned, announcing Bonnet and fellow seaman Floyd Ireson as &quot;the fiendish butchers&quot;.

The period comedy television series &quot;Our Flag Means Death&quot;, created by David Jenkins, stars Rhys Darby as Bonnet and Taika Waititi as Blackbeard. Jenkins depicts a romantic relationship between the two.

<text>The Renault 16 (R16) is a large family car hatchback manufactured and marketed over a single generation by French automaker Renault between 1965 and 1980 in Le Havre, France — and widely noted as the first French winner of the European Car of the Year award.

==Market placement==
In the early 1960s Renault was building a series of small cars, including the hatchback Renault 4 and rear engine Renault Dauphine and aimed to replace its larger family car, the Renault Frégate model (1951–1960) which had managed a modest production total of 163,383 units.

The R16 was a great success, with 1,845,959 R16s manufactured during a production run of 15 years. The car sold well in most of Europe, winning praise for its spacious and comfortable interior as well as the practicality offered by its effectively unique hatchback bodystyle. It was marketed in the United States, with only a small number sold. It met with considerably more success in Canada, where SOMA-Renault manufactured the 16 from knock-down kits.

==Design==
The mechanical layout of the R16 is similar to the Citroën Traction Avant – front-wheel drive, engine mounted inline behind the transmission, torsion bar suspension, and column mounted shift. In addition the car had an aluminium engine and an electric cooling fan, both technical innovations.

The 16 successfully introduced the hatchback bodystyle to the mid-size family segment, allowing the interior to be configured in seven different ways. This body style is between a saloon and an estate, and, before the term hatchback was coined, journalists struggled to describe it. A review in the English &quot;Motoring Illustrated&quot; in May 1965 (several months before the car was officially launched there) stated: &quot;The Renault Sixteen can thus be described as a large family car but one that is neither a four door saloon and nor is it quite an estate. But, importantly, it is a little different.&quot;

The R16 is likewise noted for its unequal wheelbase, left to right, as with the earlier Renault 4 and later Renault 5. The two rear wheel axle shafts are not in-line; rather the left wheelbase is 70 mm (2.76 in) longer than the right wheelbase, to accommodate the transverse torsion bar suspension. This and the soft front seats gives the car a particularly smooth ride even over big bumps. 

The engine was mounted longitudinally in the front, behind the gearbox/transaxle, contributing to the handling balance by keeping the weight closer to the centre of the car. Front drive layouts typically have transversely (sometimes longitudinally) mounted engines, with the engine in front of the transmission. While the R16&#x27;s north-south/forward gearbox layout gave excellent handling, servicing access to the engine was so difficult that its successor, the Renault 20, kept the north-south layout but placed the engine ahead of the gearbox.

A column-mounted gear change lever allowed a more spacious front cabin. The column-mounted gear change (required by the position of the transmission in front of the engine) was rare in West European markets.

==Model history==
Series production started in March 1965 at the company&#x27;s recently completed Sandouville plant, a few kilometers to the east of Le Havre. The car had its formal launch in March 1965 at the Geneva Motor Show, and was made available for sale in France and most other left-hand drive markets during June 1965. Late that year, it was first imported to the UK market in right-hand drive form, and would quickly establish itself as one of Britain&#x27;s most popular imported cars. It arrived on the UK market at a time when imported models still only accounted for a small percentage of new car sales, but was one of a string of cars from foreign brands which helped foreign cars increase their market share during the 1970s; other notable examples being the Fiat 127 and MK1 Volkswagen Golf. Renault&#x27;s later R5 and R12 models also sold well in Britain during the 1970s.

For 1967, Renault introduced a lower-equipped model better suited for cargo, marketed as the &quot;16 Commerciale&quot; until about 1976.

Equipment levels were high for the price. Initially, Renault sold the R16 with just a 1.5 L (1470cc) gasoline engine in &quot;GL&quot; specification for which was claimed; in March 1968 there appeared at the Geneva Motor Show the 1.6 L (1565cc) inline-four &quot;TS&quot; which could top . An automatic transmission version, originally designated the Renault 16 TA, was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show early in 1969. The top-line model was the &quot;TX&quot;, launched at the Paris Motor Show in October 1973, featuring a 5-speed manual transmission along with power front windows and central door locking, one of the first family cars in Europe to include these.

Sales of the TX were less than stellar, as with the entire 16 lineup, due to the effects of the 1973 oil crisis. The TX Automatique&#x27;s introduction was delayed in order to lower its fuel consumption to the level of that of the manual model. In October 1974 the chrome grille was replaced with a black plastic grille, except for on the 16 TX. This change did not apply in Sweden where a version of the chrome grille that incorporated headlight wipers, as required there since 1974, kept being used until 1980. In 1975 the automatics were discontinued, while the regular engine was switched to a version of the TX&#x27;s 1647 cc unit. The 16 L&#x27;s power decreased to , and could now be run on the lowest-octane fuel. In 1976 the L was replaced by a version of the TL with the same 55 PS engine. The TS was discontinued in 1976.
The American-market model arrived in late 1968 for the 1969 model year and was marketed as the Renault 16 Sedan-Wagon. The single headlights were replaced by twin sealed beam units, while slightly altered bumpers increased the overall length to . Its 851-02 engine combined the head of the 1470 cc base engine with the block of the 1565 cc unit and had a maximum output of DIN (70 PS SAE) at 5200 rpm. Sales continued into 1972 but only in very small numbers. The R16 had already been imported to Canada, and was then assembled there in the Renault-SOMA plant in Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville until 1974. A variety of different side marker lights and also some different taillights were installed on these cars.

Production of the R16 continued until 1980, five years after the arrival of its official successor, the larger Renault 20, with the Renault 18 saloon and estates continuing as Renault&#x27;s only offering of this size in Europe. By the time the R16 ceased production most other European manufacturers had at least one hatchback on sale, although most cars of the R16&#x27;s size were still sold as saloons or estates; the exceptions were the Austin Maxi, Talbot Alpine (previously sold as a Chrysler or Simca) and Volkswagen Passat. Renault did not build a hatchback of this size again until the hatchback version of the Renault 21 was launched in 1989.

The 16 had no direct competitors until the arrival of the Alec Issigonis designed Austin Maxi in 1969, but the Austin Maxi was not a strong seller outside of the UK.

==Concepts and prototypes==
===Renault 16 sedan concept===
In 1965, Philippe Charbonneaux proposed a more traditional saloon body but the project never went past prototype stage. One surviving prototype is permanently on display at the Musée Automobile Reims Champagn in Reims, France.

===Renault 16 coupé cabriolet===
A coupé cabriolet version was in development, but due to most of the body parts being unique to those used on the saloon, production would have been too costly and the project was shelved.

==Commentary==
In 1970, racing driver Stirling Moss exclaimed: &quot;There is no doubt that the Renault 16 is the most intelligently engineered automobile I have ever encountered and I think that each British motorcar manufacturer would do well to purchase one just to see how it is put together&quot;.

Pre-launch publicity was extensive, with semi-authorized media leaks. L&#x27;Auto-Journal reported details of the car, at this stage in an exclusive report, towards the end of 1963. During October 1964, timed to coincide with the Paris Motor Show, Renault distributed photographs of its innovative new family car, still at this stage described simply as the forthcoming &quot;Renault 1500&quot;, for publication as &quot;scoop&quot; pictures in various magazines. It was only two months later that the car, now officially named a &quot;Renault 16&quot;, was approved for sale by the French homologation authorities.

==Legacy==
The Renault 16 was voted European Car of the Year by a board of European motoring journalists late in 1965. It was the third winner of the award, and the Renault 16 was the first French winner - the first two winners had been British.

==Timeline==
*August 1964 – First official pictures of the R16 are released to the media.
*December 2, 1964 – The first R16 is completed at the factory in Sandouville, near Le Havre, a facility purpose-built for the R16.
*January 5, 1965 – The Renault 16 is introduced to the world and the press in a presentation on the Côte-d&#x27;Azur.
*April 1965 – The R16 is made available to the public, in two specifications: Grand Luxe and Super, both powered by a 1470 cc engine
*Autumn 1965 – The R16 is launched in right-hand drive form for the UK market.
*1967 – Ventilation and heating are both improved and the dashboard is redesigned. An automatically operated choke is also made available.
*1968 – The R16 TS is introduced. It features a new 1565 cc engine, an all-new instrument panel that includes a tachometer and water temperature gauge and many other new features including two-speed windscreen wipers, rear defroster, passenger reading light and optional manual steel sunroof and powered front windows.
*June 1968 – Australian assembly commences 
*1969 – The other R16 models get the same wheels and brakes as the TS. The TS gets reversing lights (mounted beneath the taillights). The other models are available with reversing lights as an optional extra.
*1969 – The R16 TA, with an automatic transmission, is introduced. The TA is effectively a R16 Super with some features from the TS.
*1970 – Front seatbelts are installed on all R16s.
*1971 – The R16 undergoes a mild revamp. Among the most obvious changes are new rectangular taillights. The Grand Luxe and Super are replaced by the L and TL specifications, both of which gain the same 1565 cc engine as the TS (but with the cylinder head from the 1470 cc). The TA is discontinued and an automatic transmission is made available as an option across the whole R16 range.
*1973 – An upmarket R16 TX model is introduced at the Paris Motor Show, equipped with a 1647 cc engine (an enlarged version of the TS engine) and a five-speed manual transmission. The TX was distinguishable from other R16s on the exterior by its four rectangular headlights with large turn signal lights underneath. Among the other features available on the TX were Gordini wheels, a rear spoiler, a rear windscreen wiper, a laminated windscreen, automatic seatbelts, power windows, central locking and optional air conditioning.
*1974 – The aluminium grille on L, TL and TS is replaced by a black plastic grille.

*1976 – The automatic transmission ceased to be available as an option on the L, TL and TS. However, a TL Automatic model was launched.
*1977 – The L and TS models are discontinued as Renault unveils the new R18 saloon, another car expected to appeal to current R16 owners.
*1978 – All models now have reversing lights fitted as standard.
*1979 – Rear three-point seatbelts are made standard on all models. The TL Automatic is discontinued.
*January 1980 – R16 production ends after 15 years.

<text>No Opportunity Wasted is an American television series that premiered on the Discovery Channel on October 3, 2004. It was created by Phil Keoghan, better known as the host of the CBS reality competition show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

In the series, 26 contestants are given 72 hours, $3,000 and the opportunity to fulfill a long-held dream or desire.

A version was also produced for broadcast in New Zealand, reflecting Phil Keoghan&#x27;s fondness for his native country. Also hosted by Keoghan, the show proceeded on much the same premise but with local contestants. It premiered on New Zealand&#x27;s TV2 on Sunday November 12, 2006. It was sponsored by Vodafone, whose slogan is &quot;Make the Most of Now&quot;.

A third version of the series premiered on CBC in Canada on October 3, 2007. Ten thirty-minute episodes were filmed, hosted by Canadian adventurer Bruce Kirkby following a May 2007 casting tour through the country by Keoghan.

<doc id="1290582" wikidata="Q1091233" url="?curid=1290582" title="Henry Chinaski">
<text>Henry Charles &quot;Hank&quot; Chinaski is the literary alter ego of the American writer Charles Bukowski, appearing in five of Bukowski&#x27;s novels, a number of his short stories and poems, and the films &quot;Barfly&quot; and &quot;Factotum&quot;. Although much of Chinaski&#x27;s biography is based on Bukowski&#x27;s own life story, the Chinaski character is still a literary creation that is constructed with the veneer of what the writer Adam Kirsch calls &quot;a pulp fiction hero.&quot; Works of fiction that feature the character include &quot;Confessions of a Man Insane Enough to Live With the Beasts&quot; (1965), &quot;Post Office&quot; (1971), &quot;South of No North&quot; (1973), &quot;Factotum&quot; (1975), &quot;Women&quot; (1978), &quot;Ham on Rye&quot; (1982), &quot;Hot Water Music&quot; (1983), &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1989), and &quot;Septuagenarian Stew&quot; (1990). He is also mentioned briefly in the beginning of Bukowski&#x27;s last novel, &quot;Pulp&quot; (1994).

Chinaski is a writer who worked for years as a mail carrier. An alcoholic, womanizing misanthrope, he serves as both the protagonist and antihero of the novels in which he appears, which span from his poverty-stricken childhood to his middle age, in which he finds some small success as a screenwriter.

Some of the features of the Chinaskian persona: excessive alcohol consumption; love of art (classical music, literature); solitude and self-isolation; volatile relationships (especially with women); self-effacement; nihilism; and the violation of societal norms.

== In popular culture ==
Chinaski was portrayed by Mickey Rourke in the film &quot;Barfly&quot; (1987), which Bukowski himself wrote and by Matt Dillon in the film &quot;Factotum&quot;, released in 2005. In the Dutch short film &quot;De Blauwe Bus&quot; (The Blue Bus), which was released in 2009, he was portrayed by Jan Mulder. In 2015 he was portrayed by actor Jonathan Peacy in the short film &quot;Sitting on a Fire Escape Eating Eggs&quot;.

In 1997, the American rock quartet 311 (band) released the album &quot;Transistor&quot;. The album includes two secret tracks, one at the beginning and one at the end. The hidden track at the end of the album is called &quot;Stealing Happy Hours,&quot; and it references the character in the lyrics, where it explains: &quot;Don&#x27;t wait one more minute to ask me/You make me feel like Hank Chinasky.&quot;

In 2013 the Argentine rock band Los Hijos de Claudia recorded a song called &quot;Señor Chinasky&quot;, which refers to the character in the lyrics, where it states: &quot;Mr. Chinasky, do not stop drinking&quot;.

The Avalanches used Henry Chinaski as a moniker to release &quot;Sleepy Bedtime Mix for Young Ones&quot; on the podcast Pinchy &amp; Friends.

The character inspired the name of the long-running Czech rock band Chinaski.

<text>The mediumwave transmitter Flevoland (Middengolf Zendstation Flevoland) was a broadcasting facility for medium wave near Zeewolde in the province of Flevoland, Netherlands, situated at 5°25′ E and 52°23′ N.
It has been used for broadcasting on 747 kHz (until September 2015) and 1008 kHz with a nominal power of 400 kilowatts. As aerial two guyed steel framework masts with a height of 195 metres are used, which form an anti-fading aerial. These masts are grounded and carry a cage aerial, which is upperward the separation insulator, separating the masts in a height of 95 metres in two parts, connected toward the mast construction. The radiation diagram is directional, with a maximum gain of 4 dB in South-Eastern direction, to compensate for the variation in electrical admittance of terrain in the Netherlands.

The station, which came into service in 1980, initially carried the programmes of Hilversum 1 and Hilversum 2. In 1985, following an overhaul of the Dutch public radio service, the frequencies were reassigned to NPO Radio 1 and NPO Radio 5 for 747 kHz and 1008 kHz respectively. In 2003, the 1008 kHz frequency was auctioned by the Dutch Government while NPO Radio 5 remained on 747 kHz. Since then, the 1008 kHz has been used by Radio 10 Gold (from 2004 to 2007) and Groot Nieuws Radio, a Dutch privately owned religious station.

In June 2013, NPO announced that distribution of NPO Radio 5 on Medium wave would be discontinued as of September 2015. On 1 September 2015 at 00:02 CEST, the 747 kHz and 1251kHz transmitters closed down, marking the end of Medium wave transmissions by the Dutch Public Broadcasters. The 1008 kHz remained in use by Groot Nieuws Radio, though at reduced power of 100 kW. Groot Nieuws Radio ceased broadcasting at 31 December 2018.

On 9 January 2019 the masts were demolished with explosives, marking the definitive end of mediumwave broadcasting from this location. This was the last large mediumwave transmitter in The Netherlands, marking the end of a 90-year era of mediumwave broadcasting.

<text>Logic Made Easy: How to Know When Language Deceives You is a 2004 book by Deborah J. Bennett published by W.W. Norton &amp; Company (). Its theme is the analysis of what common words such as &quot;some&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, and &quot;not&quot; mean, and how logic relates to speech and writing.

<doc id="1290592" wikidata="Q1366790" url="?curid=1290592" title="River Teviot">
<text>The River Teviot (; ), or Teviot Water, is a river of the Scottish Borders area of Scotland, and is the largest tributary of the River Tweed by catchment area. The Teviot is an important river for wildlife, especially the Atlantic salmon, but in recent years has witnessed at least four extreme flooding events.

==Course==

It rises in the western foothills of Comb Hill on the border of Dumfries and Galloway. It flows north-eastwards through Teviotdale and past Teviothead, the Colterscleuch Monument, Broadhaugh, Branxholme and Branxholme Castle.

The Teviot passes through Hawick and Lanton, past the Timpendean Tower and the village of Ancrum, Harestanes and Monteviot, Nisbet and Roxburgh, before joining the River Tweed to the southwest of Kelso.

The Borders Abbeys Way keeps close company with the Teviot on its journey to the Tweed.

==Catchment and hydrometry==
The river flows across a lowland catchment with shale underlying the surface. The headwaters are mostly moorland, woodland and some hill grazing. More intensively worked land for agriculture is found nearer the eastern end of the river where it flows into the Tweed.

The river is prone to flooding with serious events in Hawick in 2005 when it caused &quot;millions pounds worth of damage&quot;, and the river level was recorded at ). After two more extreme flooding events in 2015, and 2016 (when Jedburgh and Hawick saw water levels rising more than in an hour), a £44 million scheme was launched to provide the town with the requisite flood defences needed to extreme events occurring. Delays to the scheme meant that it wasn&#x27;t started until 2020, by which time the town was subjected to extreme flooding again when Storm Ciara hit in January 2020. Flooding was so bad, that one restaurant on the bank of the river collapsed into the floodwaters.

==Economy==
The river is used by the Borders Whisky Distillery at Hawick for cooling water and processed water. Historically, the river had many mills along its length, and the site of one in Hawick, at Cobel Cauld, is to be used with a reverse Archimedes Screw to generate hydroelectricity. The plan was approved in 2019, with an expected completion date of 2021. The plant is hoped to generate 300 megawatt hours per year; enough to power 100 homes.

==Ecology==
The river was designated as a site of special scientific interest in 2001. The designation applies to the full length of the river and other tributaries of the River Tweed. The Teviot is noted for its wildlife, including salmon, otters, lamprey and forget-me-nots. The river is an important site for breeding grounds of the Atlantic salmon.

== Tributaries ==
The principal tributaries of the Teviot are the Allan Water which enters its right bank at Newmill, the Borthwick Water which enters its left bank between Branxholme and Hawick, the Slitrig Water which enters via the right bank in Hawick itself, the Ale Water entering via the left bank at Ancrum, the Jed Water on the right bank just downstream and the Kale Water which enters on the right bank between Crailing and Roxburgh.

<text>The Moravian Cemetery is a cemetery in the New Dorp neighborhood of Staten Island, New York, United States.

==Location==
Located at 2205 Richmond Road, the Moravian Cemetery is the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island, having opened in 1740. The cemetery encompasses and is the property of the local Moravian Church congregation of Staten Island. To the cemetery&#x27;s southwest is High Rock Park, one of the constituent parks of the Staten Island Greenbelt.

== History ==
In what was a purely farming community, the cemetery was originally made available as a free cemetery for the public in order to discourage families from using farm burial plots. After the closure in the 1880s of the South Reformed Dutch Church in Richmondtown, the graves of that church&#x27;s graveyard were reinterred at Moravian.

A monument to Robert Gould Shaw, a Union soldier who led the first all-black regiment in the American Civil War and died in the Second Battle of Fort Wagner, was erected here by his family.

The Moravian Cemetery is the burial place for a number of famous Staten Islanders, including members of the Vanderbilt family. The director Martin Scorsese also has a burial plot here.

==Notable burials==

=== Vanderbilt Family Cemetery ===
In the 19th century, Cornelius Vanderbilt gave the Moravian Church of land. Later, his son William Henry Vanderbilt gave a further and constructed the residence for the cemetery&#x27;s superintendent.

The Vanderbilt Mausoleum was designed by Richard Morris Hunt and constructed in 1885–1886. It is part of the family&#x27;s privately owned cemetery, which is not open to the public. The Vanderbilt Mausoleum is a replica of a Romanesque church in Arles, France.

The Vanderbilt family cemetery&#x27;s landscaping was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. The Vanderbilt Mausoleum and portions of the cemetery were designated a New York City designated landmark in 2016.

===Italian-American Catholics===
The cemetery is the burial place of many Italian-American Catholics, even though it is a Protestant cemetery. This is due to the efforts of Father Ettore Barletta, who was in charge of the Italian Mission congregation at the nearby Moravian Church in the early 1900s. Catholic mafia families who had been refused a Catholic burial were offered burials in this cemetery.

<doc id="1290600" wikidata="Q265122" url="?curid=1290600" title="Milene Domingues">
<text>Milene Domingues Aganzo (born 18 June 1979), also known as Mika, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a midfielder.

==Career==
Born in São Paulo, Domingues played in a promotional futsal team of models run by the Flash Book modeling agency. In 1994 this team formed the basis of a new SC Corinthians women&#x27;s team. She finished her playing career with CF Pozuelo de Alarcón. The ex-model holds the women&#x27;s record for ball juggling. Until the £400,000 transfer of Keira Walsh to Barcelona in 2022, Domingues was the most expensive female football player in Spain, costing over £200,000, and second in the world behind Pernille Harder, who cost £250,000.

At international level she was included in the Brazil women&#x27;s national football team for the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. Her inclusion was somewhat surprising and coach Paulo Gonçalves emphasised that she was not a first choice: &quot;Milene is going with us, but she is between the 19th and 20th player.&quot; Despite Milene&#x27;s poor physical conditioning, Brazil&#x27;s selectors felt she would attract interest from the media and public. She remained an unused substitute in all four matches as Brazil were eliminated in the quarter finals.

She did participate in Brazil&#x27;s next match in April 2004, under their new coach René Simões, an unofficial friendly against Texas A&amp;M Aggies women&#x27;s soccer at Aggie Soccer Stadium.

==Personal life==
She was married to football star Ronaldo from April 1999 to September 2003. Together they have one son, Ronald, who was born in Milan, on 6 April 2000. Due to her marriage to Ronaldo, some fans nicknamed her Ronaldinha, but she has opposed this and prefers to be called Milene or Mika. Later, Domingues married Spanish footballer David Aganzo. She is a Buddhist.

<doc id="1290613" wikidata="Q2442726" url="?curid=1290613" title="Tony Martin (professor)">
<text>Tony Martin (21 February 1942 – 17 January 2013) was a Trinidad and Tobago-born scholar of Africana Studies. From 1973 to 2007 he worked at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and over the course of his career published more than ten books and a range of scholarly articles.

Born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Martin moved to the United Kingdom, where he studied law at Gray&#x27;s Inn, London, and then economics at the University of Hull. Relocating to the United States, he completed a PhD on the Jamaican political activist Marcus Garvey at Michigan State University in 1973. That year, he was employed as an associate professor at Wellesley College, where he was a founding member of its Africana Studies Department. During the latter part of the 1970s and 1980s he published several books on Garvey and Garveyism. In 1987 he sued his employer for racial discrimination and in 1991 was accused of harassing female students, although he denied the allegation.

Among the subjects that Martin pursued was the place of Jews in the Atlantic slave trade. During the 1990s, he came under public criticism for encouraging his students to read &quot;The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews&quot;, a book compiled by the Nation of Islam that was widely regarded as antisemitic. That decade, he also entered into a publicized argument with Classics scholar Mary Lefkowitz, a prominent critic of historical claims made by Afrocentric scholarship. Martin subsequently took Lefkowitz to court for libel, but the case was dismissed. In 1993 he self-published &quot;The Jewish Onslaught&quot;, a book that Wellesley distanced themselves from and which generated further accusations of antisemitism. In 2002 he spoke at a conference organized by a leading Holocaust denial organization, the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), alleging that Jewish organizations were trying to stifle free speech. Martin retired from Wellesley in 2007.

==Life and academic credentials==
Born Anthony Martin in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, he attended Tranquillity School, where he was a contemporary of Stokely Carmichael. After secondary school, Martin went to England to study law at Gray&#x27;s Inn, London, where he was called to the Bar in 1966.

Martin subsequently received a B.Sc. honours degree in economics at the University of Hull (1968). He taught briefly in Trinidad at Cipriani Labour College and St. Mary&#x27;s College, before moving to the United States in 1969 to pursue graduate studies in African History at Michigan State University, earning an M.A. and completing his Ph.D. in 1973. His doctoral dissertation, on Marcus Garvey and the UNIA, would be the basis for the book he later published as &quot;Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggles of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association&quot;.

Martin was founder and chair of the Africana Studies Department at Wellesley College, where he began teaching in 1973, became tenured in 1975, and became a full professor in 1979. He also taught at the University of Michigan-Flint and was a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota, Brandeis University, Brown University, and Colorado College, and also spent a year as an honorary research fellow at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad. In November 1994 he spoke at Harvard University at the invitation of the Black Students Association and praised its president Kristen Clarke for her courage in inviting him.

Martin was a prolific author of scholarly articles on many aspects of Black History and lectured all over the world. He received awards and honors from the American Philosophical Society, the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations and many others.

In 1983, Martin founded The Majority Press, a publishing company that produced many of his own books, as well as work by other authors.

Martin wrote, compiled or edited 14 published titles, including &quot;Caribbean History: From Pre-Colonial Origins to the Present&quot; (2012) and &quot;Amy Ashwood Garvey: Pan-Africanist, Feminist and Mrs. Marcus Garvey No. 1, Or, A Tale of Two Amies&quot; (2007). He had been working on two further biographies of Trinidadian women, of Audrey Jeffers (who was his aunt) and Kathleen Davis (also known as “Aunty Kay”).

Martin died unexpectedly on 17 January 2013, aged 70, at Westshore Medical Hospital, Cocorite, Trinidad and Tobago. His funeral service was held on 25 January.

==Research==

===Marcus Garvey===
Martin was a prolific Garvey scholar – he was considered by some &quot;the world&#x27;s foremost authority on Marcus Garvey&quot; – one of his earliest works being &quot;Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggles of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association&quot;, published in 1976.

He wrote a number of other books about Garvey, including &quot;Marcus Garvey, Hero: A First Biography&quot; (1983), &quot;African Fundamentalism: A Literary and Cultural Anthology of Garvey&#x27;s Harlem Renaissance&quot; (1991), &quot;Literary Garveyism: Garvey, Black Arts and the Harlem Renaissance&quot; (1983), &quot;The Poetical Works of Marcus Garvey&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Pan-African Connection: From Slavery to Garvey and Beyond&quot; (1984).

He co-authored, with Wendy Ball, &quot;Rare Afro-Americana: A Reconstruction of the Adger Library&quot; (1981).

==Controversies==

===Harassment of students===
In October 1991, a Wellesley student, Michelle Plantec, while on hall duty, claimed that she saw Martin wandering in a female dorm in a restricted area, in violation of a rule requiring male guests to be escorted. When she asked him about his escort, Martin, she claims, responded using profanity, accused her of racism and bigotry, and positioned himself so as to physically intimidate her. Martin denied all these claims, and declared that a group of women &quot;accosted him rudely, despite circumstances that in his view made the legitimacy of his presence obvious.&quot;

In an interview with a campus newspaper, Plantec said: &quot;I stopped him and said, &#x27;Excuse me, sir, who are you with?&#x27; He looked at me and said, &#x27;What do you mean?&#x27; I said, &#x27;What Wellesley student are you with?&#x27; and at that point he exploded and called me a fucking bitch, a racist, and a bigot, among other things...after all this, he went back into his meeting and said the only reason I had stopped him was because he was black.&quot;

Martin, in the same interview, agreed that there was an angry exchange, but denied that he used profanity. He also said he asked permission from the dormitory desk before going to the restroom. &quot;Coming out of the restroom, I was rudely accosted by a group of women who were coming up the stairs behind me...I tried to ignore them for a short space of time...and eventually, when we got to the top of the stairs I became very annoyed, and expressed my annoyance to the people who were behind me.&quot;

===Lefkowitz controversy, Wellesley course controversy, and lawsuit===
Mary Lefkowitz was a classics professor at Wellesley, who taught courses on ancient Greek culture. In a 1992 article for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, she challenged what she felt were ahistorical Afrocentric claims, such as the claim that Greek philosophy was plagiarized from African sources. Following publication of the &quot;New Republic&quot; piece, she and Martin became engaged in a heated disagreement, with Martin criticizing her in his department&#x27;s &quot;Africana Studies Newsletter&quot;, and she criticizing him in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and elsewhere.

As this controversy progressed, Lefkowitz discovered that students in Martin&#x27;s class were assigned a book called &quot;The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews&quot;, compiled by the Historical Research Department of the Nation of Islam. The book&#x27;s thesis is that Jews had a disproportionately large role in the black slave trade relative to their numbers. This thesis has since been refuted by mainstream historians, including the American Historical Association (AHA). 
Lefkowitz ignited a controversy over the book&#x27;s inclusion on the curriculum, and the controversy made national headlines in the spring of 1993. NPR, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and the Associated Press, among others, covered the story.
In Martin&#x27;s view, In January 1993, I was minding my own business and teaching my Wellesley College survey course on African American History when a funny thing happened. The long arm of Jewish intolerance reached into my classroom. Unknown to me, three student officers of the Jewish organization (campus B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith stablemates of the Anti-Defamation League), sat in on my class and remained for a single period only. Their purpose was to monitor my presentation. As one of them explained in a campus meeting later, Jewish students had noticed &quot;The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews&quot; among my offerings in the school bookstore. The book documents the considerable Jewish involvement in the Transatlantic African Slave Trade, the dissemination of which knowledge they, as Jews, considered an &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; and most &quot;hateful&quot; act.

One of Lefkowitz&#x27;s responses to this controversy was an article in the September/October 1993 issue of &quot;Measure&quot;, the journal of the University Centers for Rational Alternatives in Columbia University. In this article, Lefkowitz made several allegations that Martin deemed libellous. For instance, she alleged that during the October 1991 incident discussed above, Martin had called a student &quot;a white, fucking bitch&quot; and that &quot;the young woman fell down as a result of his onslaught, and Martin bent over to continue his rage at her.&quot; Martin initiated a libel suit.
Martin had already sued several undergraduates for libel, as well as Wellesley College itself.
The dean of Wellesley College, Nancy Kolodny, declined to pay Lefkowitz&#x27;s court costs, reportedly saying to Lefkowitz: &quot;It&#x27;s your problem. The college can&#x27;t help you.&quot; In the end, the Anti-Defamation League provided for Lefkowitz&#x27;s defense. Three other national Jewish organizations, the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, provided assistance. The case went through six years of appeals and counter-appeals, and was finally dismissed.

As the campus controversy wound down, Martin published a book telling his side of the story: &quot;The Jewish Onslaught: Despatches from the Wellesley Battlefront&quot; (1993). (See section below.) Lefkowitz published her own views three years later in the book &quot;Not Out of Africa&quot; (Basic Books, 1996). In 2008 she published another book, &quot;History Lesson: A Race Odyssey&quot;, giving her version of the story of the lawsuit and the controversy with Martin.

===Libel lawsuit against &quot;Counterpoint&quot;===
In the wake of the 1993 controversy, &quot;Counterpoint&quot;, a joint MIT-Wellesley student publication, asked MIT student Avik Roy to write a &quot;retrospective chronicling the controversy surrounding Martin since his arrival as associate professor in 1973.&quot; According to Roy, he was asked to write the article because the staff felt he would be less biased than a Wellesley student. The article by Roy was published in the fall 1993 issue of &quot;Counterpoint&quot;. It alleged that Martin &quot;gained tenure within the Africana Studies department only after successfully suing the college for racial discrimination,&quot; and that this explained a reluctance on the part of the college to censure Martin. Martin sued Roy for libel. Roy refused to disclose the confidential sources of his information even after the case was brought to court. A Massachusetts Superior Court Judge found that a lawsuit by Martin against Wellesley had in fact occurred, but &quot;well after his tenure, and thus could not have caused it.&quot; The suit in question was filed in 1987 and alleged racial discrimination over a merit increase. However, the 1991 libel suit was eventually dismissed, with the judge ruling that Martin did not meet his burden of proof on four out of five necessary components for proving libel. The judge found that the offending statement was &quot;partly false, but substantially true,&quot; though inaccurate in its &quot;implication of timing and causation.&quot; The judge agreed that Roy&#x27;s conclusion, that fear of litigation would cause Wellesley to exercise &quot;particular restraint&quot; when dealing with Martin, &quot;follows at least as strongly from the actual facts as it would from the erroneous version.&quot;

===&quot;The Jewish Onslaught&quot;===
In 1993, Martin published &quot;The Jewish Onslaught: Dispatches from the Wellesley Battlefront&quot;. A week after the book&#x27;s publication, it was criticized in a statement by the president of Wellesley College, who stated that it &quot;gratuitously attacks individuals and groups at Wellesley College through innuendo and the application of racial and religious stereotype&quot;, and the majority of the Wellesley faculty signed a statement condemning Martin&#x27;s work &quot;for its racial and ethnic stereotyping and for its anti-Semitism.&quot; The Chair of Martin&#x27;s department at Wellesley, Selwyn Cudjoe, labelled Martin&#x27;s book &quot;Gangsta history, meant to demean and to defame others and to bring them into disrepute, rather than to enlighten and to lead us to a more complex and sophisticated understanding of social phenomena. It ought to be labeled anti-Semitic.&quot; The book was praised by Molefi Asante of Temple University, who called it the best polemic by an African since David Walker&#x27;s 1829 classic, &quot;An Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World&quot;, and Raymond Winbush of Vanderbilt University who compared it to W. E. B. Du Bois&#x27; &quot;Souls of Black Folk&quot;.

===Martin and Henry Louis Gates, Jr.===
Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Chair of the African and African American Studies Department and Director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research at Harvard University, was critical of Martin&#x27;s work, leading Martin to describe him as &quot;Brer Gates&quot; (an allusion to Brer Rabbit) and to write: &quot;Whenever the other folks have wanted anybody to beat the rest of the race over the head with, Brer Gates has been on the scene, like an HNIC [&quot;Head Negro in Charge&quot;] machine. They gave him an unprecedented full-page op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; to attack the Nation of Islam&#x27;s &quot;Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews&quot;. This op-ed was actually typeset in the shape of a Star of David. There is no evidence that Gates even read the book, but he pulled together some platitudes attacking it anyway.&quot;

===Institute for Historical Review===
In June 2002, Martin presented a talk entitled &quot;Tactics of Organized Jewry in Suppressing Free Speech&quot; at the 14th IHR Conference sponsored by the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), in which he summarizes his experience of the controversy following his accusations about Jews as principal actors in the slave trade. The IHR is the world&#x27;s leading Holocaust denial organization, publishing articles and holding conferences denying the extermination of European Jewry by the Third Reich.

==History==
Anne Arundel Community College was founded as Anne Arundel Junior College on January 2, 1961, by the Anne Arundel County Board of Education. Classes commenced in September 1961 at Severna Park High School with 270 students enrolled. Dr. Andrew G. Truxal served as the first president during the school&#x27;s transition to a campus in Arnold, Maryland, in September 1967. The school was awarded full accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) in 1968.

In August 1968, Dr. Robert P. Ludlum was appointed AACC&#x27;s second president. During his eight-year term, AACC began offering transfer, career and continuing education programs as well as tuition waivers and programs for senior citizens. Additionally, Dr. Ludlum attained voting representation for students serving on the AACC&#x27;s board of trustees and founded the Servicemember&#x27;s Opportunity College at Fort George G. Meade.

Upon Dr. Ludlum&#x27;s retirement in 1976, his successor, Dr. Justus D. Sundermann, served until 1979. He is credited with the establishment of AACC&#x27;s Weekend College, cable television (media production) courses and contract education services. AACC&#x27;s first off-site location in Glen Burnie and the Child Development Center in Arnold were opened during Dr. Sundermann&#x27;s administration. Also under Dr. Sundermann, there were staff factions in contention with one another and enrollment was in decline. In 1978, some of AACC&#x27;s female faculty members filed lawsuits against the community college and insurer Continental Casualty Company for alleged pay discrimination. The lawsuits were consolidated and received news coverage while Dr. Sundermann was president. The board subsequently voted against renewing his contract 1979. (The case was settled in 1989 in favor of the female faculty members, who were awarded $550,000 in retroactive pay.)

From 1979 until his retirement in 1994, Dr. Thomas E. Florestano put AACC on a path to unprecedented growth as it fourth president. Within that period, Anne Arundel County developed, AACC&#x27;s campus expanded to and the Glen Burnie Town Center location opened. To further AACC&#x27;s mission, Dr. Florestano supported the active recruitment of students, administrators and faculty members through marketing at mall booths, increased mail correspondence, a streamlined registration process and higher faculty wages. As a result of his efforts—including student retention programs and curriculum expansion through eight-week minimesters and more off-site program offerings—the community college saw enrollment grow from 13,000 to approximately 36,000 and the annual budget from $9 million to $33 million.

On August 1, 1994, Dr. Martha A. Smith became AACC&#x27;s fifth president and focused on evolving the community college into one that would serve its community economically via the integration of academic and vocational education. AACC&#x27;s senior administration was reorganized and the previously separate offices of academic affairs and workforce development were combined. During her tenure, tuition was kept affordable, AACC&#x27;s number of degree programs grew twofold and the graduating class of 2012 was nearly double the size of that of 1996. AACC was nationally recognized as a leader in cybersecurity education, workforce training and for student excellence. Dr. Smith garnered state and county funding for campus construction and renovation projects, which led to the opening of additional off-site locations: a Sales and Service Training Center; the Regional Higher Education Center; the Hotel, Culinary Arts and Tourism Institute building and a Center for Cyber and Professional Training. After 18 years of service, Dr. Smith retired on August 1, 2012.

Dr. Dawn Lindsay was appointed the sixth president of Anne Arundel Community College in 2012.

Within the terms are sessions that span 13 weeks, eight weeks and weekends. An academic year begins on the first day of the fall term and ends on the last day of the summer term.

AACC runs a program for high school students known as the Early College Access Program (ECAP) (formerly known as Jump Start). The program allows current high school students at partnering schools to take college courses.

AACC&#x27;s endowment had a market value of approximately $7.8 million in the fiscal year that ended in 2019. The community college&#x27;s special academic facilities include an astronomy lab and two art galleries.

==ROTC==
AACC has crosstown agreements with the University of Maryland College Park (UMD) (Air Force and Army) and Bowie State University (BSU) (Army) for its Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program. The program is available to full-time AACC students in good academic standing. UMD and BSU&#x27;s ROTC programs began in 1920 and 1974, respectively. They are home to Detachment 330 for the Air Force ROTC.

==Athletics==
In 1961, former high school basketball coach and local YMCA basketball director Dr. Johnny Laycock founded AACC&#x27;s athletics program. He served as the program&#x27;s director and chairman of the physical education department until he retired in 1986. Dr. Laycock led volleyball, the program&#x27;s first intramural sport, at Severna Park High School, where academic courses were initially held. Basketball, wrestling and baseball followed.

Dr. Laycock is credited with significantly expanding AACC athletics during his tenure. By the early 1980s, the program had gained 12 full-time faculty, chaired 22 varsity sports and had achieved NJCAA membership. AACC offered a sailing program for faculty and students. There were also continuing education programs for older adults: bicycling, rowing, aerobic dance, swimming and resistance training. Students were required to earn two physical education credits toward degree completion. With Dr. Laycock&#x27;s input, the Arnold campus featured a newly constructed athletics complex with a gymnasium, outdoor stadium, tennis courts and fields for baseball, soccer, softball and lacrosse.

The AACC athletic teams, formerly known as the Fighting Pioneers, are collectively known as the Riverhawks. Because the mascot design for the Pioneers could not be decided, 1,000 AACC students, community members and alumni were presented with an online survey to select a new mascot. In December 2014, the majority of the votes cast determined that the AACC athletic teams would be called Riverhawks by fall 2015.

The AACC athletic association chairs 12 varsity athletic programs. The Riverhawks are members of the Maryland Junior College Athletic Conference (MDJUCO) and Region 20 of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). Men&#x27;s sports include: baseball, basketball, cross country, esports, golf, lacrosse and soccer. Women&#x27;s sports include: softball, basketball, cross country, esports, lacrosse, soccer and volleyball.

AACC&#x27;s teams have won four national championships in men&#x27;s lacrosse (1998), women&#x27;s softball (2003) and women&#x27;s lacrosse (2006 and 2007).

===Athletic facilities===
Students and student-athletes are granted access to the on-campus fitness facilities in the David S. Jenkins Gymnasium at AACC&#x27;s Arnold campus. Women&#x27;s volleyball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball home games are played at the gymnasium, which features a 650-seat capacity, six basketball hoops, two weight training facilities and the Riverhawk Athletic Training Facility. Siegert Stadium hosts men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer and lacrosse home games. Softball home games are played at the Softball complex and baseball home games at “Skip” Brown Baseball Field. The three practice fields are available to the public during the day and for rent by external organizations when not in use by AACC. Student athletes and local cross-country high school students have access to the Riverhawk Cross Country Trails for meets, practice and conditioning.

<text>South Street Park is a former baseball ground located in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. The ground was home to the Indianapolis Blues of the National League for the 1878 season and was also known then as National Park. The ground first hosted baseball for the city&#x27;s International Association entry during 1876–1877. It was also a neutral site for some Chicago White Stockings games during 1878.

The ballfield was located on a block bounded by Delaware Street (west), South Street (south), and Alabama Street (east). The site was later occupied by Big Four freight houses. It is currently a parking lot for Gainbridge Fieldhouse, which is across the street to the west.

<doc id="1290645" wikidata="Q45116" url="?curid=1290645" title="Herman Li">
<text>Herman Li (; born 3 October 1976) is a Hong Kong-born British musician. He is one of two lead guitarists and one of the producers and songwriters for the power metal band DragonForce. Li has played with the band based in England since it was formed in 1999 by Li along with Sam Totman, both of whom are also the remaining original members of the band. Before DragonForce he was in the black metal band Demoniac.

==Early life==
Herman Li was born on 3 October 1976 in Hong Kong and moved to France, then to England during his teenage years. He speaks English, French and Cantonese fluently.

==Playing style==
Li draws influences from rock, all subgenres of metal as well as video game music; he often mimics sounds from popular retro games from the late 1980s, early 1990s arcade, and PC games. His playing style consists of fast descending and ascending legato and staccato licks, exotic scale runs, making extensive use of the harmonic minor and Phrygian dominant scale, extreme use of his whammy bar, quick full ascending and descending sweep picking arpeggios, alternate picking and two-handed tapping on the higher frets as well as incorporating many other shred guitar style techniques. Li sometimes uses a device called the Hot Hand that sits on his right hand like a ring, which causes extreme vibrato when shaken, giving him a greater capacity to emulate certain video game sounds. Li has stated Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Tony MacAlpine guitar playing heavily inspired his own style. Li is left-handed, but plays guitar right-handed.

==Equipment==

===Guitars===

Li uses Ibanez E-Gen guitars, his signature Ibanez models based on his old Ibanez S Series, which was retired from stage at the end of the Inhuman Rampage tour. The EGEN18 has a &quot;Transparent Violet Flat&quot; finish (transparent purple on a flamed-maple top), and the EGEN8 has a &quot;Platinum Blonde&quot; finish (natural wood finish with a flamed-maple top). Both have a rosewood fingerboard and gold hardware. The E-Gen model has many unique features and improvements over a standard S, including its versatile tone selection with coil tap switching for both the bridge and neck pickups, Edge Zero bridge (the EGEN8 has Edge III), custom DiMarzio HLM pickups (the EGEN8 has Ibanez pickups) and an extended scoop on the lower horn of the body, as well as a &quot;Kung-Fu grip&quot; on the upper horn shaped by Li&#x27;s hand. It is currently Ibanez&#x27;s flagship model for S body style guitars.

On 9 May 2010 Li announced via Facebook that he had received a custom-made Ibanez 7-string guitar. No details are known yet about this guitar, other than it has seven strings, and it is unknown whether it will be mass-produced for his E-Gen signature line.

Before the E-Gen, he had been known to play Ibanez S Prestige guitars. An Ibanez S470SOL (Japanese build 1995), a seven string Ibanez 540S7 (Japanese build 1991) (used in Revolution Deathsquad, Storming the Burning Fields, before the second verse and in the outro of Heartbreak Armageddon and the bridge section of Operation Ground and Pound), and an Ibanez S540FMTTS (Japanese build 1995). He has also been seen playing an Ibanez S2170FB and an Ibanez S2170FW. He also owns an Ibanez Jem7BSB, which has been used on every DragonForce album for recording rhythm guitar parts, an Ibanez J Custom RG, an Ibanez RG2228 (8-string model), and a PRS Modern Eagle, which he received as a gift from Paul Reed Smith and can be seen in the studio.

===Amplifiers and effects===
Li uses a Kemper Profiler as his primary amplifier.

==Popular culture==
Li and fellow band member Sam Totman are featured as performing twin guitar solos of the power metal song &quot;Through the Fire and Flames&quot; which has appeared in several video games. In the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; rhythm game series, the song first featured in &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; as an unlockable bonus song. The song later appeared in &quot;Guitar Hero Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero Live&quot;, as well as &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; as downloadable content. The song also featured in &quot;Rocksmith 2014&quot;.

<doc id="1290647" wikidata="Q442718" url="?curid=1290647" title="German tanker Altmark">
<text>Altmark was a German oil tanker and supply vessel, one of five of a class built between 1937 and 1939. She is best known for her support of the German commerce raider, the &quot;pocket battleship&quot; and her subsequent involvement in the &quot;Altmark Incident&quot;. In 1940 she was renamed Uckermark and used as supply tanker for the battleships and during Operation Berlin before sailing to Japan in September 1942 as a blockade breaker. 

Footage of &quot;Altmark&quot; appears briefly in the 1942 British wartime propaganda movie &quot;The Day Will Dawn&quot;. 

== The Altmark Incident ==

&quot;Altmark&quot; (Captain Heinrich Dau) was assigned to support &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; during her raid in the South Atlantic between September and December 1939. Seamen rescued from the ships sunk by &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; were transferred to &quot;Altmark&quot;. After &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was heavily damaged by British cruisers in Battle of the River Plate and subsequently scuttled by her crew, in the Río de la Plata in December 1939, &quot;Altmark&quot; attempted to return to Germany, steaming around the north of Great Britain and then within the Norwegian littoral. On 14 February 1940 &quot;Altmark&quot;, proceeding south within Norwegian territorial waters, was discovered by three British Lockheed Hudson Mk.II aircraft from RAF Thornaby and pursued by several British destroyers led by . Late on 16 February 1940 in Jøssingfjord she was fired upon while the Norwegian Navy stood by and took no action save for raising a protest flag. The German tanker then received a boarding party from HMS &quot;Cossack&quot;. During an attempted escape across the ice, seven of the &quot;Altmark&quot; crew were shot down. During the skirmish &quot;Altmark&quot; was run onto the rocks. It had been the British intention to tow the ship back to a Scottish port, but the damage to the tanker&#x27;s stern frustrated this idea.

An attack by one belligerent upon its enemy in neutral waters is a breach of neutrality. Hitler had long feared Norway would be insufficiently resolute to protect the German iron-ore traffic that passed legitimately along the Norwegian littoral and after earlier discussions with Admiral Erich Raeder and Vidkun Quisling had decided already on 14 December 1939 to ultimately invade the country. On 19 February 1940 he ordered intensified planning for attacks on Norway and Denmark, which eventually took place on 9 April 1940 under the code name Operation Weserübung.

The British justification for the attack on the &quot;Altmark&quot; was set out in a Note to the Norwegian Government from Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax dated 10 March 1940. The problem the British Government faced was the wording of The Hague Convention XIII of 1907 to which it was a signatory. Article 10 provides that: &quot;The neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through its territorial waters of warships or prizes belonging to belligerents.&quot;

This meant that the &quot;Altmark&quot; was within its rights to sail through Norwegian waters with prisoners aboard providing that it did not come to a protracted stop longer than 24 hours. In the diplomatic letter, the British government confirmed that it was not contrary to the law of neutrality to sail a prison ship through neutral waters, and Britain often did this herself. In fact the British complaint had nothing to do with the prisoners. &quot;Altmark&quot; was a fleet tanker assimilated to a warship and was proceeding to Germany from the Atlantic by the north-about route. Instead of sailing down the North Sea as he would do in peacetime, the master of the &quot;Altmark&quot; had elected to sail the entire leg of the voyage southwards within Norwegian territorial waters in order to attract immunity from attack there under international law. There was no other reason for him to want to voyage through waters so dangerous to navigation. With no valid breach of international law, the British excused their violation of international law by contriving that the &quot;Altmark&#x27;s&quot; course abused international law even without a violation, and since the Norwegians had declined to stop a voyage that was not in violation of international convention the British Admiralty decided it was justified in taking action contrary to law, essentially announcing that it had the right to determine what course an enemy ship must travel to be entitled to the protections of international law.

The question remains unresolved to this day as to whether, as the Hague Conventions stood in 1940, a warship could legitimately seek immunity from attack in neutral waters by widely varying its course to reach them.

== Subsequent history ==
The ship, renamed Uckermark on 6 August 1940, then resumed the role for which she had been built. During Operation Berlin, which involved the battleships and between January and March 1941, &quot;Uckermark&quot;, under Captain Zatorski, was a supply ship and scout attached to the squadron. As the result of her reports the battleships were directed to various merchant vessels, which were then sunk.

On 9 September 1942 she left France for Japan with a cargo of vegetable oil and fuel, supplying the auxiliary cruiser on the way, arriving at Yokohama on 24 November 1942. &quot;Uckermark&quot; was then intended as the replenishment ship for the German raider , which was raiding merchant shipping in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean areas.

On 30 November 1942, &quot;Uckermark&quot; was anchored at Yokohama, Japan, next to &quot;Thor&quot; and the captured Australian passenger liner SS &quot;Nankin&quot;, carrying a load of explosives, which &quot;Thor&quot; had captured in March five days out from Fremantle, Australia, en route to Colombo, Ceylon. While the crew was at lunch, &quot;Uckermark&quot; suffered an explosion and fire which spread to &quot;Nankin&quot;, resulting in a larger explosion that sunk the &quot;Uckermark&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, and &quot;Nankin&quot; and destroyed a portion of the docks. The cause of the fire and explosions was thought to be a spark from tools used by a repair gang working near the cargo tanks igniting residual gasoline. The &quot;Uckermark&quot; had delivered 5000 tons of gasoline to Yokohama. It is unknown if the ship had an inerting system for its cargo tanks installed, but, as tanker vessels with inerting systems were uncommon at the time the ship was built, it is likely that combined with wartime stresses the lack of (or inoperability of) an inerting system contributed significantly to the power of the initial explosion. A comparable incident was the explosion of the MS &quot;Bidwell&quot; at Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, in 1932. Fifty-three crewmen from &quot;Uckermark&quot; died in the explosion. The severely damaged ship was beyond repair and was scrapped.(:ja:横浜港ドイツ軍艦爆発事件)

Some of the survivors of the ship were sent to France on the blockade runner &quot;Doggerbank&quot; and perished when the ship was mistakenly sunk by the on 3 March 1943 with all but one of the 365-strong crew lost at sea.

<text>John Hamilton Davidson (born December 13, 1941) is an American actor, singer, and game show host known for hosting &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!,&quot; &quot;Time Machine,&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in the 1980s, and a revival of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; in 1991.

==Biography==
Davidson was born to Dr. James Allie Davidson (1908–1984) and Elizabeth Emma Beck (1908–1996), both Baptist ministers, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He lived in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, and graduated from White Plains High School (in White Plains, New York), then entered Denison University. He considered following in his parents&#x27; footsteps, but ultimately decided that he &quot;would rather sing about love than preach it.&quot;

Davidson worked in situation comedies, game shows, variety shows, and talk shows. In 1964 he appeared in the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; presentation of &quot;The Fantastiks&quot; with Ricardo Montalbán and Susan Watson. In the summer of 1966, he was the host of two prime-time variety hour shows, &quot;The Kraft Summer Music Hall&quot; and &quot;The John Davidson Show&quot;, the latter of which included George Carlin and Richard Pryor. In the 1980s he became well known for co-hosting &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot; (1980–84), a human-interest/stunt-themed series.

==Career==
In 1967 Davidson made his film debut in &quot;The Happiest Millionaire,&quot; alongside Lesley Ann Warren and Fred MacMurray. The following year he appeared with Warren again in &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot;. He appeared as a guest singer on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in 1967 and 1969, and as the Mystery Guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1969. His career was managed by Alan Bernard, former manager of Andy Williams and one of the partners in BNB, the largest personal management firm in the 1970s.

In 1987, during an appearance on &quot;Scrabble&quot; he mentioned that he appeared as an underwear model in the 1959 Sears catalog, when he was seventeen. He made his Broadway debut in the 1964 production of &quot;Foxy,&quot; which starred Bert Lahr. He also appeared in &quot;State Fair&quot; in 1996.

He was a member of the repertory company on the short-lived CBS variety show &quot;The Entertainers&quot; (1964–65). He was a regular player on many anthology and variety series of the 1970s–80s, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show,&quot; &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour,&quot; &quot;Love American Style&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat,&quot; &quot;Fantasy Island,&quot; and &quot;.&quot;

Davidson made numerous appearances on the original &quot;Hollywood Squares,&quot; from the game show&#x27;s premiere in 1966 to its cancellation in 1981. He was known for his long-winded bluffs which often fooled contestants with his often ridiculous answers to questions the program&#x27;s host, Peter Marshall, posed. Most times, Marshall could barely conceal a grin as Davidson began some far-fetched but plausible explanations for his answers, often prefaced with some misleading statement like &quot;I just read about it in the New England Journal of Medicine, it was a fascinating study, and it said that...&quot; Davidson put over these preposterous stories with such sincerity that many a contestant was fooled more than once. 

In 1973 and 1974, he starred with Sally Field on the situation comedy &quot;The Girl with Something Extra.&quot; In 1974 he guest-starred on the television series &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, in the episode &quot;Mask of Death&quot;, portraying a cross-dressing lounge singer who murders his/her fans. In the episode, Davidson sings in drag while impersonating such notables as Carol Channing, singing &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. Also in 1974, the singer posed near-nude (with a discreetly placed towel) for the magazine &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

In 1977, Davidson was present at the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire in Southgate, Kentucky. He was expected to appear onstage as the headline act the evening the fire broke out. Davidson helped others escape before fleeing through a back door. Davidson&#x27;s music director, Douglas Herro, was among the 165 victims. Davidson was unharmed in the disaster and later participated in a charity concert to raise funds for the families of the victims.

In the late 1970s, the actor appeared 87 times as a regular guest host on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.&quot; In the early 1980s he hosted his own talk show, produced by Westinghouse Broadcasting/Group W, after it canceled &quot;The Mike Douglas Show.&quot; &quot;The John Davidson Show&quot; aired daily in syndication from 1980 to 1982. In 1985, he hosted the NBC daytime game show &quot;Time Machine.

Davidson appeared as a host on real estate promoter Dave Del Dotto’s paid programs during the late 1980s and early 1990s, which were notable for taking place in outdoor, scenic settings (such as Hawaii). These &quot;infomercials&quot;, as they have come to be called, often appeared on late night television and were a staple for years on many cable channels till the FCC filed a complaint against Del Dotto in 1995, alleging that he had &quot;made false and unsubstantiated representations&quot; in his programs.
Davidson hosted a revival of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; which ran from 1986 to 1989. He also hosted 170 episodes of a revival of &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot; in 1991. He also appeared as a featured guest on The Carpenters&#x27; television specials &quot;Space Encounters&quot; (1977) and &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot; (1980). Following his run on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, he was one of six people who auditioned to host the CBS daytime version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (in the end, Bob Goen was hired).

==Recording career==
Davidson was also a successful recording artist. He recorded twelve albums in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s. From 1966 to 1971, he recorded for Columbia Records, where he enjoyed his greatest success. Five of his albums reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts, with &quot;The Time of My Life!&quot; peaking at No. 19 in 1966. His albums usually consisted of covers of recent hit singles along with some new material.

As a singles artist, he placed seven records on the Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;Everytime I Sing a Love Song&quot;, released in 1976, peaked at No. 7, his most successful single.

===Discography===
==Film career==
Davidson acted in many movies, including &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; (1967), &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot; (1968), &quot;Coffee, Tea or Me?&quot; (1973), &quot;The Concorde... Airport &#x27;79&quot; (1979), &quot;Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders II,&quot; (1980) and &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990).

==Stage work==
Davidson has appeared in productions of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,&quot; &quot;Kismet,&quot; &quot;State Fair,&quot; &quot;Man of La Mancha,&quot; &quot;Chicago,&quot; and &quot;The Will Rogers Follies,&quot; at the Surflight Theatre in Long Beach Island, New Jersey. He has also performed the autobiographical play &quot;Father/Son and Holy Ghost,&quot; about his relationship with his father, who was a minister.

In July 1991 Davidson appeared in summer stock with Sacramento Music Circus of Sacramento, California, in &quot;The Music Man&quot; alongside Susan Watson, Richard Paul, Carol Swarbrick, and the Delta Music Society Quartet of Sacramento.

Davidson performed daily in 1993–94 in Branson at a theater bearing his name.

In May 1999, Davidson and Stephanie Mills joined the cast of the Chicago company of &quot;Ragtime&quot; as the Father and Sarah, respectively.

In late 2011 Davidson was listed as a guest star with The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies at the Plaza Theatre in Palm Springs, California.

In June 2012 Davidson took on the role of Henry in the off-Broadway revival of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;. In April 2013 he took on the role of the Wizard in the first North American tour of &quot;Wicked&quot;. In 2016, Davidson played Norman Thayer in &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; at Judson Theatre Company in Pinehurst, North Carolina. In June 2017, he took on the role of Charles Frohman/Captain James Hook in the North American tour of &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;.

==Personal life==
Davidson&#x27;s first marriage was to Jackie Miller. He has two children: John Davidson Jr., who often appeared with his father on later versions of &quot;Hollywood Squares;&quot; and Jennifer (Davidson) Kane. Davidson has been married to former backup singer Rhonda Rivera since 1983; they have a daughter, Ashleigh Davidson. They live primarily in Tamworth, New Hampshire.

The son of two Baptist ministers, Davidson now identifies as an atheist, declaring himself &quot;openly secular&quot; in a video for the Openly Secular Coalition begun by the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, the Secular Coalition for America, and other humanist groups.

<text>Heat is an English entertainment magazine published by Bauer Media Group. Its mix of celebrity news, gossip, beauty advice and fashion is primarily aimed at women, although not as directly as in other women&#x27;s magazines. It also features movie and music reviews, TV listings and major celebrity interviews.

==History==
&quot;Heat&quot; was launched in February 1999 as a general interest entertainment magazine, at a cost of more than £4m. However, unlike other Emap (now Bauer) magazine launches before and after, it was not an immediate success, with a circulation below 100,000. A series of revamps quickly repositioned the magazine as a less serious, more gossip-oriented magazine aimed at women, and circulation quickly grew. A series of high-profile celebrity relationships, such as Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt provided ample material, while reality shows such as &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;Pop Idol&quot; grew popular at just the right time to help fill pages. Heat achieved record sale figures when Jade Goody had a make-over and was first on the front cover after her stint in &quot;Big Brother 3&quot; (2002) and later when Nikki Grahame and Pete Bennett from &quot;Big Brother 7&quot; split and Grahame was interviewed for &quot;Heat&quot; in 2006.

In 2009–10, &quot;Heat&quot; spearheaded a campaign alongside Girls Aloud&#x27;s Nicola Roberts advocating the banning of sunbed use in the UK for under-18s. The campaign was a success and a bill was passed by Parliament shortly before the 2010 General Election.

The site crashed after the magazine was mentioned on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Million Pound Drop&quot;; it took up to eight days to restore the site.

===Editors===
* Barry McIlheney (1999–2000)
* Mark Frith (2000–08)
* Julian Linley (2008–09)
* Sam Delaney (2009–2010)
* Lucie Cave (2011–2012); Editor-in-Chief across the heat brand (2012-)
* Jeremy Mark (2012–15)
* Suzy Cox (2015-)

An edition of the magazine is also published in South Africa.

==Heatworld.com==

Heatworld.com launched on 22 May 2007 and was edited by Julian Linley, who had been deputy editor of &quot;Heat&quot; magazine for five years. The site is an online interpretation of the magazine, emulating the mix of celebrity news, gossip and fashion. However, heatworld.com does not replicate magazine content and bases itself more on video and audio content and breaking news. The site is advertising funded.

==Heat Radio==
On 25 September 2007, Heat Radio was launched. The station is owned by Bauer Radio, a division of the company, Bauer, which owns &quot;Heat&quot; magazine. The station can be listened to across the UK on DAB Digital Radio, on their app or at heatradio.com.

==Television channel==
On 3 July 2012, Heat launched, featuring celebrity news and music. The channel comes from Box Television, a joint venture between Bauer and Channel Four. It replaced Q on Sky, Smallworld Cable and Virgin Media in the UK, in Ireland on Sky and UPC Ireland and in Iceland on Síminn.

In May 2016, the channel was rebranded as Box Upfront.

==Heat merchandise==
As &quot;Heat&quot; magazine grew in popularity, spin off merchandise was released to cash in on its success. Current items carrying the &quot;Heat&quot; brand name are an exercise DVD titled &quot;Heat: Get That Celeb Look&quot; which was released in 2003, an interactive DVD game featuring celebrity questions, an annual for the year 2007 and in 2003 a set of mini books titled &quot;Say What&quot; were released containing quotes from celebrities such as Gareth Gates.

==Controversy==
In an issue which was released on 27 November 2007, &quot;Heat&quot; used a photograph of Katie Price&#x27;s disabled son, who suffers from septo-optic dysplasia, a rare condition which means he is visually impaired and suffers from hormonal deficiencies, causing him to easily gain weight and means he is partially blind, on a sticker which was included with the magazine, with the slogan &quot;Harvey wants to eat me!&quot; The magazine&#x27;s editor Mark Frith made an apology for the offence caused by the sticker, and an apology was also posted on the magazine&#x27;s website. A spokesperson for the Press Complaints Commission confirmed that Katie Price was planning to make a complaint about the matter. The magazine was also criticized in the press over the incident, with one editorial describing it as &quot;the lowest point in British journalism&quot;.

In another issue released on 6–12 September 2014, &quot;Heat&quot; published a photograph of Justin Timberlake, husband to Jessica Biel, at a nightclub in Paris on the night after his performance. The star was photographed partying with women at the club as the title named it &quot;Justin Timberlake gets flirty with another woman – That&#x27;s not his wife!&quot; Once the article, as well as the pictures surfaced it caused his marriage with Jessica to be manipulated. The singer and actor lodged a defamation claim in the courts in Ireland against the publishers of the celebrity title over an article, photographs and quotes attributed to Biel. In the agreed statement read in the high court, a lawyer for the &quot;Heat&quot; publisher Bauer group admitted the article headlined &quot;The flirty photos that rocked Justin and Jessica&#x27;s marriage&quot; was based on an unfounded report. The article also included purported statements improperly attributed to Biel which the publishers said &quot;Heat&quot; now understands the actor never made. The Bauer media group later apologized on &quot;Heat&quot; magazine&#x27;s behalf over these allegations, and a settlement was made in a hearing before the president of the High Court, Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns.

==Heat&#x27;s Twitter Awards==
&quot;Heat&quot; launched heat&#x27;s Twitter Awards in 2013 that it says will celebrate “the joyful collision of celebrities and social media”. Heat promoted its celebrity Twitter awards via Heat&#x27;s TV, radio, magazine and social media platforms as well as a marketing campaign, which will include press, radio, digital, PR and retail activity.

Specially created videos for each category were released as the campaign progressed and designed to bring each category to life. The winners were announced via Heatworld.com and also its YouTube Channel.

<doc id="1290676" wikidata="Q14716743" url="?curid=1290676" title="National League Park">
<text>National League Park is the name of two former baseball grounds located in Cleveland, Ohio, US. The first ground was home to the Cleveland Blues of the National League from 1879 to 1884.

The Kennard Street Baseball Grounds (Kennard Street Park), later renamed National League Park, was bounded by Sibley Street (present Carnegie Avenue) on the north, Cedar Avenue on the south, Kennard Street (present East 46th Street) on the west, and the eastern edge ended at the boundary of the back yards of the houses facing Willson Avenue (present East 55th Street). A contemporary plat map indicates the diamond was closest to the Kennard-Cedar intersection.

The second National League Park was the home of the Cleveland Spiders of the American Association from 1887 to 1888 and of the National League from 1889 to 1890. This ground was located a few blocks northwest of the Kennard site. It was contained within a large block bounded by Payne, Euclid, Case [later 40th] and Sterling [later 30th] Avenues, with the main entrance at Payne and Douglass [later 35th] Avenues. The third base line was parallel to Payne, and the first base line parallel to Sterling. That put the main stand in the northwest corner, near Payne and Sterling.[Cleveland &quot;Plain Dealer&quot;, February 27, 1887, p.3] During 1887-1888 the newspapers called it &quot;Association Park&quot;, and during 1889-1890 the papers called it &quot;National League Park&quot; or just &quot;League Park&quot;.

After the 1890 season the Spiders moved to League Park.

<text>Andrew Hampsten (born April 7, 1962) is an American former professional road bicycle racer who won the 1988 Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Alpe d&#x27;Huez stage of the 1992 Tour de France. Between 1986–1994 he finished in the Top 10 of eight Grand Tours.

==Racing career==
Andy Hampsten caught the public eye in 1985, when he won stage 20 of the Giro d&#x27;Italia. The following year, he was signed by Bernard Hinault&#x27;s La Vie Claire team. In his first full season as a pro, 1986, he won the Tour de Suisse and helped his compatriot and team leader Greg LeMond to victory in the Tour de France. He also finished the Tour de France fourth overall and claimed the white jersey of best young rider.

Hampsten repeated his victory in the 1987 Tour de Suisse, this time for the 7-Eleven Cycling Team. He defeated multi-time Tour de France stage winner Peter Winnen by +0:01 and Fabio Parra by +0:07. His greatest moment came in the 1988 Giro d&#x27;Italia, on a short stage over the Gavia Pass. Attacking on the climb Hampsten overcame a severe snowstorm to take the Maglia Rosa, becoming the first American to do so; although he finished second on the stage to Dutchman Erik Breukink, who was considered a main favorite to win the Giro. The conditions during this stage were among the worst in cycling history. During and following this stage numerous cyclists abandoned and several had to be loaded into ambulances and taken to the hospital due to hypothermia like symptoms. After surviving this Gavia Pass stage, Hampsten was able to successfully defend his lead through the rest of the race, becoming the just the 2nd American to win a cycling Grand Tour and the 1st American to win the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

During the 1989 Giro d&#x27;Italia Hampsten performed at an elite level among the general classification riders finishing on the podium in 3rd place overall. He was also among the elite riders for the majority of the 1990 Tour de France.

Hampsten&#x27;s final highlight came in the 1992 Tour de France when he dropped his breakaway companions to win the stage to Alpe d&#x27;Huez. He again finished the race fourth, having lost his third place to Gianni Bugno in the final time trial.

==Life after racing==
Hampsten used to live in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and the bikeway system there has been dedicated as the &quot;Andy Hampsten Bikeway System.&quot; Hampsten now lives in Tuscany and Boulder, Colorado. In 1999, Andy Hampsten and his brother Steve started a bicycle company in Seattle, Washington, called Hampsten Cycles. Andy Hampsten also operates a bicycle touring company in Italy called Cinghiale Cycling Tours.
