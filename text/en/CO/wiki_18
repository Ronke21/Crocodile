<text>Joseph Angelo D&#x27;Allesandro III (born December 31, 1948) is an American actor and Warhol superstar. He was a sex symbol of gay subculture in the 1960s and 1970s, and of several American underground films before going mainstream.

Dallesandro starred in the Andy Warhol-produced film &quot;Flesh&quot; (1968) as a male prostitute. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine declared Dallesandro&#x27;s second starring film &quot;Trash&quot; (1970) as the &quot;Best Film of the Year&quot;, making him a star of the youth culture, sexual revolution, and subcultural New York City art collective in the early 1970s. Dallesandro also starred in the Factory films &quot;Heat&quot; (1972), &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; (1974), and &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1974), which were directed by Paul Morrissey. Dallesandro later lived in Europe for several years where he starred in both genre and art films. Having returned to the United States, he also crossed over into mainstream roles such as mobster Lucky Luciano in the film &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984).

== Early life ==
Joe Dallessandro was born on December 31, 1948 in Pensacola, Florida, to Joseph Angelo D&#x27;Allesandro II, who was in the U.S. Navy. His mother, Thelma Testman, was 16 years old. His parents separated soon after they moved to New Jersey when he was 2 years old. Dallesandro and his younger brother Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Dallesandro were placed in foster care of Mr. and Mrs. Gary Silano in North Babylon, New York.

By the time Dallessandro was five years old, his mother was serving fifteen years in a U.S. federal penitentiary for interstate auto theft. He was later reunited with his mother in 1970.

Dallesandro was initially content living with his foster parents, but as he became a teenager he reportedly began to resent them, thinking that they were preventing him from living with his father. He became aggressive and repeatedly ran away from his foster home until his father finally relented and allowed Joe to live with him. 

At age 13, Dallesandro and his brother moved to Queens, New York to live with their paternal grandparents and their father. &quot;I was very rebellious,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I hated the Queens school. They were so far behind the Long Island school that I just lost interest.&quot; He was expelled from school for punching the school principal. After this, he began hanging out with gangs and stealing cars. At age 15, Dallesandro drove a stolen car through the Holland Tunnel without paying the toll. He was stopped by a police roadblock and was shot once in the leg by police who mistakenly thought he was armed. Dallessandro managed to escape being caught by police, but was later arrested when his father took him to the hospital for his gunshot wound. He was sentenced to Camp Cass Rehabilitation Center for Boys in the Catskills in 1964. In 1965, aged 16, he ran away from the camp, and went to live with his father in Florida. Dallessandro made his way to the West Coast with a friend and briefly worked at a pizza shop. He supported himself by nude modeling for Bob Mizer&#x27;s Athletic Model Guild.
== Career ==

=== Underground film career ===

By 1967, Dallessandro had returned to New York. He was married at the age of eighteen, and he was hustling around Times Square to pay for his drug habit.

He met pop artist Andy Warhol and film director Paul Morrissey while they were shooting &quot;Four Stars&quot; (1967) in Manhattan&#x27;s Greenwich Village, and they cast him in the film on the spot. Dallesandro began working at the Factory as Warhol&#x27;s bodyguard, general factotum, and occasional actor.

Dallesandro appeared in &quot;Lonesome Cowboys&quot; (1968) before starring in the film &quot;Flesh&quot; (1968), a story of a male hustler—based on Dallesandro&#x27;s experience—where he had several nude scenes. &quot;Flesh&quot; became a crossover hit with mainstream audiences, and Dallesandro became the most popular of the Warhol stars. Warhol would later comment &quot;In my movies, everyone&#x27;s in love with Joe Dallesandro.&quot;

The Warhol and Morrissey films did not usually have a script so the actors improvised while the cameras were rolling. In 1970, Dallesandro told &quot;After Dark&quot;: &quot;Sometimes they yell at me and say, &#x27;Joe, you&#x27;re really messing it up. Stop trying to act,&#x27; and then I usually do a good job. But if you watch carefully you&#x27;ll see that my best performing comes when I have my clothes off. When I&#x27;m dressed I really don&#x27;t give very good performances, but when I am not I really do a great job.&quot;

After starring in &quot;Trash&quot; (1970), Dallesandro&#x27;s underground fame began to cross over into the popular culture and he was viewed as a sex symbol. &quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Vincent Canby wrote of him: &quot;His physique is so magnificently shaped that men as well as women become disconnected at the sight of him.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot; film critic Jerry Parker wrote that &quot;Joe Dallesandro, who is a mere 21 is to Andy Warhol what Clark Gable once was to Louis B. Mayer.&quot; Dallesandro appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in April 1971. He was also photographed by some of the top celebrity photographers of the time: Francesco Scavullo, Annie Leibovitz, Richard Avedon.

According to Dallesandro, Francis Ford Coppola wanted him to screen test for the role of Michael Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972)&quot;.&quot; However, the offer fell through when Warhol told Coppola&#x27;s entourage that Dallesandro was a drug addict.

Dallesandro also starred in the films &quot;Heat&quot; (1972), &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; (1973), and &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1974), directed by Morrissey. The latter two were filmed in Rome. After filming was complete, he remained in Europe and capitalized on his reputation as a cult figure in a series exploitation films in France and Italy. He appeared in Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Je t&#x27;aime moi non plus&quot; (1976), which starred Gainsbourg&#x27;s girlfriend, British actress Jane Birkin.

=== Mainstream career ===
The death of Dallesandro&#x27;s brother in 1977 sent him into a deep decline and his marriage dissolved in 1978. After his return to the U.S. in 1979, he resided in a trailer park close to Seattle with his estranged mother and indulged in excessive drinking. After relocating to Los Angeles, he cleaned himself and got a job as a taxi driver before returning to acting.

He made several mainstream films during the 1980s and 1990s. One of his first notable roles was that of 1920s gangster Lucky Luciano in Francis Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984). Working with manager/attorney Stann Findelle, his career enjoyed a resurgence.

He had roles in &quot;Critical Condition&quot; (1987) opposite Richard Pryor, &quot;Sunset&quot; (1988) with Bruce Willis and James Garner, &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990) with Johnny Depp, &quot;Guncrazy&quot; (1992) with Drew Barrymore, and Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;The Limey&quot;. He has also worked in television. In 1986, he co-starred in the ABC drama series &quot;Fortune Dane&quot;. The series lasted only five episodes. Dallesandro was also a regular for the first season (1987-1988) of the CBS crime drama series &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, appeared in three episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, and a two-hour episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Matlock&quot; in 1990.

A biography, &quot;Little Joe: Superstar&quot; by Michael Ferguson was released earlier in 2001, and a filmed documentary, &quot;Little Joe&quot; (2009), was released with Dallesandro serving as writer and producer. His adopted daughter, Vedra Mehagian, also served as a producer of the film.

In February 2009, Dallesandro received the Teddy Award, an honor recognizing those filmmakers and artists who have contributed to the further acceptance of LGBT people, culture and artistic vision.

He appeared in the Dandy Warhols&#x27; official video for &quot;You are Killing Me&quot; in 2016.

In 2018 he starred as himself in Ulli Lommel&#x27;s &quot;Factory Cowboys: Working with Warhol&quot;. The film was based on Lommel&#x27;s own biography and partly on Dallesandro&#x27;s memories of the period during which he worked with Andy Warhol.

== Personal life ==
Dallesandro is openly bisexual. He has been married three times and has two children.

Aged 18, he married his first wife, Leslie, the daughter of his father&#x27;s girlfriend, in 1967. Their son, Michael, was born December 19, 1968. The marriage was dissolved in 1969. His second marriage was to Theresa (&quot;Terry&quot;) in 1970. Their son, Joseph A. Dallesandro, Jr., was born November 14, 1970. The couple divorced in early 1978. In 1987, Dallesandro was married a third time, to Kimberly (&quot;Kim&quot;). Dallesandro has a grandson and a granddaughter by his son Michael, as well as a grandson by his son Joseph.

Dallesandro&#x27;s younger brother Robert Dallesandro died in 1977. He had worked for Warhol as a chauffeur, also appeared in the films &quot;Flesh&quot; and &quot;Trash&quot;.

Semi-retired from acting, as of 2009 Dallesandro managed a residential hotel building in Los Angeles.

== In popular culture ==
* In Lou Reed&#x27;s song, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, about the characters Reed knew from Warhol&#x27;s studio, The Factory, the verse about Dallesandro used his nickname, Little Joe.
* A Warhol photograph of the crotch bulge of Dallesandro&#x27;s tight blue jeans is on the famous cover of the Rolling Stones album &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;. Dallesandro explained to biographer Michael Ferguson, &quot;It was just out of a collection of junk photos that Andy pulled from. He didn&#x27;t pull it out for the design or anything, it was just the first one he got that he felt was the right shape to fit what he wanted to use for the fly;&quot; the first editions of that album cover physically incorporated a functional metal zipper fly into the photo.
* The 1980s British band The Smiths used a still photograph of Dallesandro from the film &quot;Flesh&quot; as the cover of their eponymous debut album.

===San Francisco Giants (1986–1993)===
In his first major league at-bat on April 8, 1986, on his first swing, Clark hit a home run off Nolan Ryan. A few days later, Clark also homered in his first home game at Candlestick Park.

In Game 1, Clark had already hit a solo home run. Prior to a subsequent at-bat, Cubs&#x27; catcher Rick Wrona went to the mound to discuss with Greg Maddux how to pitch to Clark. From the on-deck circle, Clark watched the conversation and read Greg Maddux&#x27;s lips saying &quot;fastball high, inside.&quot; The first pitch was a fastball high and inside which Clark sent into the street beyond right field for a grand slam. Afterwards, pitchers began to cover their mouths with their gloves when having conversations on the pitcher&#x27;s mound. (The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s front page the next day paid tribute to his performance with a headline of &quot;Clark&#x27;s night on Addison&quot;, referring to the street outside Wrigley Field where the home runs landed.)

In Game 5 of the series, Clark faced Cubs closer Mitch Williams with the score 1–1 in the bottom of the eighth inning. Clark singled to center field to drive in two runs, breaking the tie, eventually sending the Giants to the World Series. Clark&#x27;s efforts, which included a .650 batting average and two home runs, resulted in him being named NLCS MVP. The Giants went on to face the Oakland Athletics in the 1989 World Series, but were swept. In the only World Series appearance of his career, Clark failed to contribute significantly at the plate, finishing with no runs batted in and a .250 batting average while battling tonsillitis.

Clark had become a very durable player since his rookie year injury, setting a San Francisco record with 320 consecutive games played from September 1987 through August 1989. In January 1990, he signed a four-year, $15 million contract with the Giants, which at the time made him the highest-paid player in the majors. However, a string of injuries reduced his playing time in the early 1990s and diminished his production. Clark drove in just 73 runs in , the lowest total since his rookie year.

===Texas Rangers (1994–1998)===
The Texas Rangers signed Clark to replace his former Mississippi State teammate, Rafael Palmeiro, at first base. Clark made the American League All-Star team in 1994 and finished the season with a .329 batting average, the second-highest of his career. He maintained a high level of offensive production throughout his tenure with Texas, finishing below .300 only in 1996. Injuries limited his playing time to 123, 117 and 110 games from 1995 through 1997, but Clark led the Rangers to American League West Division titles in 1996 and 1998. Clark struggled offensively in both the 1996 and 1998 postseasons, though he put together his most productive regular season in seven years in 1998 (.305, 23 HRs, 41 2Bs, 102 RBIs). Following the 1998 season, the Rangers re-signed Rafael Palmeiro, effectively ending Clark&#x27;s days with the team.

===Baltimore Orioles and St. Louis Cardinals (1999–2000)===
Clark signed a two-year deal with the Orioles before the season, again replacing Palmeiro, who had left Baltimore to return to Texas. Part of the reason Clark chose Baltimore was to be near Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, since Clark&#x27;s son, Trey, has autism. Clark spent nearly two years with Baltimore but was plagued by injuries. On June 15, Clark got his 2000th hit versus the Kansas City Royals.

At the MLB trade deadline in 2000, the Orioles traded Clark to the St. Louis Cardinals for José León. He was acquired in part to play in place of the injured Mark McGwire. Clark batted .345 while hitting 12 home runs and driving in 42 runs in 51 games. Clark helped the Cardinals defeat the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS with four runs batted in during the series. In the NLCS, the Cardinals faced the New York Mets. Clark batted .412 in the series but the Mets won the series and the National League pennant. Despite being revitalized during his time with the Cardinals, he decided to retire at the end of the season, largely due to familial obligations. Clark batted .319 during his final season and went 1 for 3 in his final game on October 16, 2000.

==Legacy==
Clark was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in . He was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in June 2004, the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame on April 26, 2007, and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame on August 1, 2008. Clark&#x27;s final statistics were 284 home runs, 1,205 RBI, a .303 batting average, and a .881 OPS. In 2006 Hall of Fame balloting, Clark received 23 votes, 4.4% of the total, which withdrew him from consideration from future ballots, as he did not receive the required 5% threshold to stay on.

Clark holds the record for most home runs against Hall of Fame Pitcher Nolan Ryan with 6.

It was announced on August 11, 2019, that the Giants would retire Clark&#x27;s #22 during the 2020 season. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the retirement ceremony was postponed to 2022. Clark&#x27;s number was ceremoniously retired on July 30, 2022.

==Accomplishments and honors==



==Personal life==

<doc id="1272121" wikidata="Q716331" url="?curid=1272121" title="Li Tang (painter)">
<text>Li Tang (, courtesy name Xigu 晞古; c. 1050 – 1130) was a Chinese landscape painter who practised at Kaifeng and Hangzhou during both the Northern Song and Southern Song dynasty. He forms a link between earlier painters such as Guo Xi, Fan Kuan and Li Cheng and later artists such as Xia Gui and Ma Yuan. He perfected the technique of &quot;axe-cut&quot; brush-strokes and his style of painting became for what is regarded as the academy-style landscape of the Southern Song.

==Biography==
Li Tang was born ca. 1050, a native of Heyang. Already in his early years he earned his living by painting. Sometime after 1100, under Emperor Huizong, he earned the highest rank in the Painting Academy at the court in Bianjing (now Kaifeng).

He survived the invasion by the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1126–27, and, together with the court, moved to Qiantang (now Hangzhou), which became the capital city of the newly established Southern Song Dynasty. He continued to serve as painter in the court under Emperor Gaozong, and died circa 1130.

==Character of his art==

Li was among the most influential of the early Southern Song landscape artists and had many followers. He represented a vital link between the Northern Song school (Guo Xi, Fan Kuan, Li Cheng, and others), and the later Southern Song painters, such as Xia Gui and Ma Yuan, both of whom studied Li&#x27;s art. He developed and perfected the technique of the so-called &quot;ax-cut&quot; brushstrokes, which gave rocks and mountains a particularly fine quality.

===&quot;Wind in Pines Among a Myriad Valleys&quot;===
As with most Song artists, few of Li Tang&#x27;s paintings survive, and most are of questionable authorship. The large hanging scroll &quot;Wind in Pines Among a Myriad Valleys&quot; (also known as &quot;Whispering Pines in the Mountains&quot;; National Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan) is the only painting that bears a clear signature by the artist, which is placed on one of the peaks in the top section. It reads: &quot;Painted by Li Tang of Ho-yang in Spring of the &quot;chia-ch&#x27;en&quot; year of the Hsüan-ho Reign of the Great Song [Dynasty].&quot; The texture of the rocks in this painting is a standard example of the &quot;ax-cut&quot; strokes technique.

===Other attributed works===

Other works commonly attributed to Li Tang are &quot;Intimate Scenery of River and Mountains&quot;, a long landscape scroll, and &quot;Sitting on Rocks Gazing at the Mist&quot;, both in the possession of the National Palace Museum.

<text>John Giorno (December 4, 1936 – October 11, 2019) was an American poet and performance artist. He founded the not-for-profit production company Giorno Poetry Systems and organized a number of early multimedia poetry experiments and events. Giorno&#x27;s creative journey was marked by collaborations, groundbreaking initiatives, and a deep exploration of diverse art forms. He gained prominence through his association with pop art luminary Andy Warhol, sparking a creative partnership that propelled his career to new heights.

Giorno&#x27;s artistic evolution was shaped by his encounters with Warhol and other influential figures. His notable appearance in Warhol&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Sleep&quot;, where he slept on camera for over five hours, introduced audiences to his unique blend of performance and artistic expression. Giorno&#x27;s creative trajectory was marked by an array of multimedia poetry experiments, one of which was the pioneering &quot;Dial-A-Poem&quot; project. This venture allowed individuals to access brief poems by contemporary poets via telephone, forging a novel connection between technology and poetry.

Collaboration was a hallmark of Giorno&#x27;s work, as he joined forces with renowned artists, including William S. Burroughs, Patti Smith, Laurie Anderson, Philip Glass, and Robert Mapplethorpe. His poetic style evolved over time, encompassing techniques such as appropriation, cut-ups, and montage. His signature double-column poems, characterized by repetition, mirrored the vocal distortions he employed in his performances. As Giorno&#x27;s career progressed, his work began to incorporate political themes, notably his active protests against the Vietnam War.

Beyond his artistic endeavors, Giorno embraced spirituality and activism. A transformative trip to India in 1971 introduced him to Tibetan Buddhism, particularly the Nyingma tradition. He was one of the earliest Western students of Tibetan Buddhism, inviting various Tibetan teachers to New York City and hosting them. As a committed AIDS activist, he founded the AIDS Treatment Project in 1984, providing vital support to those affected by the epidemic. Giorno&#x27;s impact extended globally, as he continued to perform, collaborate, and exhibit his work, leaving an enduring legacy in the worlds of poetry, performance art, and multimedia exploration.

==Early life and education==
Giorno was born in New York City, and was raised both in Brooklyn and the Long Island town of Roslyn Heights. He attended high school at James Madison High School in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University in 1958, where he was a &quot;college chum&quot; of physicist Hans Christian von Baeyer. At Columbia, he was a resident of Livingston Hall. While in his early twenties, he briefly worked in New York City as a stockbroker.

==Career==
In 1962, Giorno met Andy Warhol during Warhol&#x27;s first New York Pop Art solo exhibit at Eleanor Ward&#x27;s Stable Gallery. In 1963, they became lovers and Warhol remained an important influence for Giorno&#x27;s developments in poetry, performance and recordings. A lesser-known Warhol film featuring Giorno, &quot;John Washing&quot; (1963), runs a mere 4½ minutes. Warhol&#x27;s 1964 silent film &quot;Sleep&quot; shows Giorno sleeping on camera for more than five hours. Giorno and Warhol are said to have remained very close until 1964, after which time their meetings were rare. 

Inspired by Warhol, and subsequent relationships with Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, Giorno began applying Pop Art techniques of appropriation of found imagery to his poetry, producing &quot;The American Book of the Dead&quot; in 1964 (published in part in his first book, &quot;Poems&quot;, in 1967). Meetings with William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin in 1964 contributed to his interest in applying cut up and montage techniques to found texts, and (via Gysin) his first audio poem pieces, one of which was played at the Paris Museum of Modern Art Biennale in 1965.

Inspired by Rauschenberg&#x27;s Experiments in Art and Technology events of 1966, Giorno began making &quot;Electronic Sensory Poetry Environments&quot;, working in collaboration with synthesizer creator Robert Moog and others to create psychedelic poetry installation/happenings at venues such as St. Mark&#x27;s Church in New York. In 1965, Giorno founded a not-for-profit production company, Giorno Poetry Systems, in order to connect poetry to new audiences, using innovative technologies. In 1967, Giorno organized the first Dial-A-Poem event at the Architectural League of New York, making short poems by various contemporary poets available over the telephone. The piece was repeated to considerable acclaim at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970, and resulted in a series of LP records compiling the recordings, which were issued by Giorno Poetry Systems. Some of the poets and artists who recorded or collaborated with Giorno Poetry Systems were William Burroughs, John Ashbery, Ted Berrigan, Patti Smith, Laurie Anderson, Philip Glass, Robert Rauschenberg, Anne Waldman, and Robert Mapplethorpe. From 1976 to 1979, Giorno also hosted The Poetry Experiment and presented his eight-part series Dial-A-Poem Poets, with Charles Ruas, on WBAI-Pacifica Radio. 

Giorno&#x27;s text-based poetry evolved rapidly in the late 1960s from direct appropriation of entire texts from newspapers, to montage of radically different types of textual material, to the development of his signature double-column poems, which feature extensive use of repetition both across columns and down the page. This device allowed Giorno to mimic the echoes and distortions he was applying to his voice in performance. A number of these poems were collected in &quot;Balling Buddha&quot; (1970). The poems also feature increasingly radical political content, and Giorno was involved in a number of protests against the Vietnam War. Spiro Agnew called Giorno and Abbie Hoffman &quot;would be Hanoi Hannahs&quot; after their WPAX radio broadcasts made to the U.S. troops in South Vietnam on Radio Hanoi. Some of Giorno&#x27;s work from this period was published in 0 to 9 magazine, a late 1960s avant-garde publication that experimented with language and meaning-making.

Giorno traveled to India in 1971 where he met Dudjom Rinpoche, head of the Nyingma order of Tibetan Buddhism. He became one of the earliest Western students of Tibetan Buddhism, and participated in Buddhist communities for several decades, inviting various Tibetan teachers to New York City and hosting them. Some of Giorno&#x27;s poetry reflects Buddhist and other Asian religious themes beginning with his earliest verse, but the poems in &quot;Cancer In My Left Ball&quot; (1972) and those that follow involve a highly original interpenetration of Buddhist and Western avant-garde practices and poetics.

Touring rock clubs in the 1970s with Burroughs, Giorno continued to develop an amplified, confrontational performance poetry that was highly influential on what became the Poetry Slam scene, as well as the performance art of Karen Finley and Penny Arcade, and the early Industrial music of Throbbing Gristle and Suicide. He made the album &quot;Who Are You Staring At?&quot; (1982) with Glenn Branca, is prominently featured in Ron Mann&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Poetry in Motion&quot;, and is heard in performance with guitarist Rudolph Grey in the opera &quot;Agamemnon&quot; (1993). &quot;Who Are You Staring At?&quot; was featured in 2023 at the Centre Pompidou in a Nicolas Ballet curated no wave exhibition entitled &quot;Who You Staring At: Culture visuelle de la scène no wave des années 1970 et 1980&quot; (&quot;Visual culture of the no wave scene in the 1970s and 1980s&quot;).

Giorno stopped using the found elements of the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp tradition in his poetry in the early 1980s and henceforth pursued a kind of experimental realism, using lyrical incantation and minimalist art-like repetition.

Giorno celebrated queer sexuality from the 1964 &quot;Pornographic Poem&quot;, through his psychedelic evocations of gay New York City nightlife in the 1970s, to more recent poems such as &quot;Just Say No To Family Values&quot;. He founded an AIDS charity, the &quot;AIDS Treatment Project&quot; in 1984, which continues to give direct financial and other support to individuals with AIDS to the present day.

In addition to his collaborations with Burroughs, Giorno produced 55 LPs, tapes, videos and books. He performed at poetry festivals and events, notably in Europe where he was an active participant in the sound poetry scene for several decades. Giorno&#x27;s artwork &quot;Poem Prints (&quot;1991) is included in the permanent collection of the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida. The piece was acquired through the larger acquisition of over 400 language-based artworks from the collection of founders of the Sackner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry, a Miami based words and language arts collection. 

Giorno lived at 255 East 74th Street, when a small carriage house was located on the property. He later lived and worked from three lofts in a building in the Bowery neighborhood on the Lower East Side.

In 2007 he appeared in &quot;Nine Poems in Basilicata&quot;, a film directed by Antonello Faretta based on his poems and his performances. In addition to his solo performances in live poetry shows, since 2005 he had collaborated in some music-poetry shows with Spanish rock singer and composer Javier Colis.

The first career-spanning collection of Giorno&#x27;s poems, &quot;Subduing Demons in America: Selected Poems 1962–2007&quot;, edited by Marcus Boon, was published by Soft Skull in 2008.

In 2010, Giorno had his first one-person gallery show in New York City, entitled &quot;Black Paintings and Drawings&quot;, at the Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery, wherein he exhibited works that chronicled the evolution of the poem painting. The first &quot;Poem Prints&quot; were part of the Dial-A-Poem installation in the 1970 exhibition &quot;Information&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art. Connecting words and images, the poet uses the materiality of the written word to confront audiences with poetry in different contexts.

In 2011, he starred in one of two versions for the music video to R.E.M.&#x27;s final single &quot;We All Go Back to Where We Belong&quot;.

==Death==
Giorno died of a heart attack at age 82 on October 11, 2019, at his home in Lower Manhattan. At the time of his death, he was married to Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone.

<text>Carlos Gregorio Dávila Espinoza (September 15, 1887 – October 19, 1955), was a Chilean political figure, journalist, chairman of the Government Junta of Chile in 1932, and secretary general of the Organization of American States (OAS) from 1954 until his death in 1955.

==Early life==
Dávila was born in Los Ángeles, Chile, to Luis Dávila and Emilia Espinoza. He graduated from the University of Santiago, Chile, (then called School of Arts and Crafts) in 1907. In 1911, he entered law school at the University of Chile, but dropped out three years later to work for newspaper &quot;El Mercurio&quot;, of Santiago. He left that paper in 1917 to establish &quot;La Nación&quot; of the same city, which he directed until 1927. In 1932, he founded the Chilean magazine &quot;Hoy&quot;.

==Political career==
From 1927 to 1931, Dávila served as Chilean ambassador to the United States. In 1929, he received an honorary LL.D. from Columbia University, and another the same year from the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, California.

===Socialist Republic of Chile===

Dávila was a member of the Government Junta of Chile that controlled Chile from June 4 to July 8, 1932, serving as president of the Government Junta from June 16. On July 8, Dávila dissolved the Government Junta and assumed power as &quot;Provisional President of Chile&quot;, calling new congressional elections. He served as provisional President of Chile until September 13, one of six people during that year to lead the country as President of Chile and/or President of the Government Junta.

===Professor, journalist and international public service===
In 1933, Dávila was visiting professor of international law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, under the auspices of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Later he came to the United States and was associated for many years with the Editors Press Service, and acted as correspondent for numerous important South American newspapers. In 1941 he received the Maria Moors Cabot Award from Columbia University for his distinguished journalistic contribution in the service of the Americas. A prolific writer, Dávila is the author of &quot;We of the Americas&quot;, published in 1949 and has contributed many analytical studies on politics and economics to leading American publications.

Dávila served on the Council of United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration from 1943 to 1946, and was Chilean representative to the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee in 1940. In the same year, he became the author of the &quot;Dávila plan&quot;, which created the Inter-American Development Commission, which became the Inter-American Council for Integral Development within the Organization of American States, when that body was created in 1948. In 1946, he served as a member of the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

Having contributed to the founding of the OAS, Dávila was chosen, in August 1954, as its secretary general.

== Personal life ==
Dávila&#x27;s first wife, Herminia Arrate de Dávila, died in Chile in 1941, and Dávila returned to the United States with their two daughters, Luz and Paz. In 1950, he remarried, this time to Frances Adams Moore of Massachusetts, a widow with a daughter, Dolly, by her first husband.

Dávila died on 19 October 1955, 14 months into his service as secretary general of the Organization of American States.

<doc id="1272142" wikidata="Q5046647" url="?curid=1272142" title="Carrollton bus collision">
<text>The Carrollton bus collision occurred on May 14, 1988, on Interstate 71 in unincorporated Carroll County, Kentucky. The collision involved a former school bus in use by a church youth group and a pickup truck driven by an alcohol-impaired driver. The head-on collision was the deadliest incident involving drunk driving and the third-deadliest bus crash in U.S. history. Of the 67 people on the bus (counting the driver), there were 27 fatalities in the crash, the same number as the 1958 Prestonsburg bus disaster, and behind the 1976 Yuba City bus disaster (29) and 1963 Chualar bus crash (32).

In the aftermath of the disaster, several family members of victims became active leaders of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and one—Karolyn Nunnallee—became national president of the organization. The standards for both operation and equipment for school buses and similar buses were improved in Kentucky and many other states. These include an increased number of emergency exits, higher standards for structural integrity, and the use of less volatile diesel fuel. On Interstate 71, the crash site is marked with a highway sign erected by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Memorial items such as crosses and flower arrangements are regularly placed at the site by families and friends.

==Background==
On May 14, 1988, a youth group mostly consisting of teenagers who attended North Hardin High School, James T. Alton Middle School, Radcliff Middle School, and four adults from Assembly of God church in Radcliff, Kentucky, boarded their church bus and headed to Kings Island theme park in Mason, Ohio, about from Radcliff. The group included church members and their guests. As everyone arrived early that Saturday morning, the number of those wanting to go on the trip had grown to more than originally anticipated. The church&#x27;s principal pastor, who did not join the journey, restricted the ridership to the legal limit of 66 persons plus the driver.

===Bus===
The bus involved in the crash was a former school bus, configured with a bus body mated to a medium-duty truck chassis and frame. The 1977 model-year Ford B700 chassis was mated to a Superior school bus body. The vehicle was designed with a capacity of 66 passengers and a driver, including 11 rows of 39-inch wide seats, separated by a 12-inch central aisle.

Ford Motor Company manufactured the B700 chassis at its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky; it was then shipped to Superior Coach Company of Lima, Ohio. A company owned by industrial conglomerate Sheller-Globe Corporation, Superior manufactured the school bus body that was installed on the Ford B700 chassis. The vehicle was certified as a &quot;school bus&quot; with an effective build date of March 23, 1977, the date associated with the construction of the Ford chassis (as required by federal regulations).

Both the vehicle type and the build date would later serve as important legal distinctions. The bus was manufactured on March 23, 1977, just nine days before four major federal safety standards were to take effect for school bus production. In addition to upgraded rollover protection, school buses produced on or after April 1, 1977, were required to be designed with improved structural integrity in body joints, better seating protection in crashes, and improved fuel system protection (to reduce spills and fires).

The completed bus was delivered in time for use during the 197778 school year and served ten years in use as a school bus. Radcliff Assembly of God acquired the used school bus as surplus from the Meade County school district, and the church had owned it for about one year as a church bus. In July 1987, the church successfully made the same round trip with the bus to Kings Island. Along with short local moves on school days, the church also drove the bus successfully on several other long trips. It was maintained regularly by mechanically inclined church members, including a civilian motor pool supervisor from nearby Fort Knox. A week before the 1988 Kings Island trip, the bus received two new tires of good commercial quality; the front-end suspension and steering components were also examined at that time. The 11-year-old vehicle was considered to be in good mechanical condition on May 14, 1988.

===Trip===

On the trip, the bus was driven by John Pearman, a part-time associate pastor of the church who was a local court clerk. The group left the church early that morning and traveled uneventfully to the park. They spent the whole day and early evening at Kings Island, then boarded the bus and began traveling out of Ohio and back into Northern Kentucky toward Radcliff. After about an hour, they stopped to fill the 60-gallon (227-litre) fuel tank with gasoline, then resumed the trip southward.

==Collision==
At 10:55 p.m., while heading south on Interstate 71 outside of Carrollton, Kentucky, the bus collided almost head-on with a black 1987 Toyota pickup truck which was traveling at high speed the wrong way (north in the southbound lanes) on a curved stretch of the highway. The small truck was driven by Larry Wayne Mahoney, a 34-year-old factory worker who was intoxicated. Mahoney later admitted he had been drinking in a bar and at a friend&#x27;s house prior to the collision. Police also found a twelve-pack of Miller Lite beer in Mahoney&#x27;s truck which was still cold and had several cans missing.

During the collision, the left rear of the pickup truck spun 90 degrees to the right and, while doing so, struck the left side of a 1977 Cadillac Sedan de Ville heading in the same direction of the bus causing damage to the back driver&#x27;s door and vinyl roof. The car had broken glass along with red plastic material that was from the taillight lens of the Toyota. The right front of the pickup truck struck the right front of the bus, breaking off the bus&#x27; suspension and driving the leaf spring backward into the gas tank mounted behind an exterior panel but outside the heavier frame, just behind the step well for the front door. The front door was jammed shut by collision damage.

Both vehicle drivers sustained injuries, but nobody aboard the bus was seriously injured by the actual collision between the two vehicles. However, the right front suspension of the Ford chassis broke off through the bus stepwell, puncturing the gasoline tank and igniting the fuel supply. When fire first broke out immediately after the collision, bus driver John Pearman tried to put it out with a small fire extinguisher while passengers began to evacuate through the center rear emergency door, squeezing through the narrow opening between the two rear seats and jumping to the ground.

A survivor recounted the short timeframe of events: &quot;We knew we hit something, and…all the kids got up in the aisle thinking we were gonna get off. And within 20 second you felt the heat come in the bus. You started hearing kids crying and screaming for their mom, panicking. That&#x27;s when everybody started pushing on everybody to go one way.&quot; Another remembered startling awake after the collision and attempting to escape through a window but it refused to open, before rushing to the back.

Survivors said after emptying the small fire extinguisher, Pearman helped some of the many children find their way down the narrow and dark aisle to the only practical way out of the smoke-filled bus. According to the NTSB investigation, more than 60 people trying to reach the rear emergency door—the only available exit—created a crush of bodies in the 12-inch-wide aisle. Many passengers found themselves unable to move. A beverage cooler which had been earlier placed in the aisle near row 10 (of 11 rows of seats) aggravated the crush.

Other passengers tried unsuccessfully to break or kick out any of the split-sash side windows. Only one adult, a woman who was of small stature, managed to escape through a opening side window. When she looked back up from the ground, the window opening was filled with flames. The other three adults aboard died, including Pearman. Passersby and some of the escaped passengers helped to extract immobilized children through the rear door, and help them to ground level about below. A survivor recounted how when he reached the back door; &quot;Someone on the outside grabbed my arm, put their foot on the bumper and literally pulled me out. I hit the asphalt and started running... I could hear the screams and the explosions.&quot;

Within four minutes, the entire bus was on fire, and soon the exodus of passengers stopped. At that point, the passersby who had stopped to help could not reach those still aboard due to the raging fire, and turned their efforts to tending to the crowd of 40 mostly injured survivors. Soon the entire interior of the bus flashed over, ultimately burning the trapped 27 people remaining aboard.

After first responders treated and transported survivors and extinguished the fire, a crane was used to load the bus onto a flatbed truck that transported the bus and those persons killed to the National Guard Armory in Carrollton. There, the Kentucky State Police and the Carroll County coroner went through the interior of the bus seat by seat to find and remove bodies, most of which were burned beyond recognition.

== Victims ==
In total, 26 passengers and the bus driver died, 34 passengers were injured, and six passengers escaped the bus without serious injury. Larry Mahoney, the driver of the Toyota pickup, sustained injuries from the collision. The deceased children ranged in age from 10 to 19 years old, with a majority aged between 13 and 14 years old.

Many bodies were found facing the only exit, the rear door. The coroner later determined that none of the bus occupants suffered broken bones or mortal injuries from the crash impact; all had died from the fire and smoke. The victims are as follows:

Among the bus survivors, one person&#x27;s leg from just below the knee had to be amputated, and about ten others suffered disfiguring burns. Only 6 bus passengers were uninjured and virtually all suffered varying degrees of emotional trauma and survivor guilt syndrome.

== Investigation ==
The National Transportation Safety Board responded, conducted an investigation and issued a report on March 28, 1989.

The NTSB determined that &quot;the probable cause of the collision between the pickup truck and the church activity bus was the alcohol-impaired condition of the pickup truck driver who operated his vehicle opposite to the direction of traffic flow on an interstate highway.&quot; The agency also found that the design of the 11-year-old bus also contributed to the fatalities. The bus&#x27;s fuel tank was unprotected, seat covers were made of flammable material, and the rear exit was partially blocked by a row of seats. Following the NTSB report, and much sooner in many instances, many federal, state, and local agencies and bus manufacturers changed regulations, vehicle features, and operating practices.

The board recommended the phaseout of buses not meeting the federal standards established in 1977. The standards required all new school buses to have stronger fuel tanks, stronger seats and more accessible emergency exits. At the time the report was issued, about 22% of school buses in use nationwide were built before the standards were in place. The board also recommended stricter punishments for drunk driving.

== Legal ==
There was considerable civil litigation. Ford Motor Company, Sheller-Globe Corporation, and others eventually contributed to settlements with all victims and/or their families.

=== Truck driver ===
Mahoney had been previously arrested for driving under the influence in 1984, for which he was fined US$300 and his driver&#x27;s license was suspended for six months. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) two hours after the crash was .24 percent—substantially more than the 1988 Kentucky legal limit of .10. Mahoney had no memory of the crash and learned of the collision after waking in the hospital the next day.

Mahoney was indicted by a Carroll County grand jury July 23, 1988, on 27 counts of murder. He pleaded not guilty, and bail was set at $270,000, $10,000 for each death in the crash. The Carroll County Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney initially planned to seek indictments for capital murder which would have made Mahoney eligible for a possible sentence of death by electrocution if convicted. Ultimately, however, it was decided not to file those charges. Mahoney posted bail and was released from jail in October 1988. On December 21, 1989, Mahoney was found guilty of all charges. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years after a jury of the Carroll Circuit Court, under Indictment No. 88-CR-27, convicted him of 27 counts of manslaughter in the second degree, 16 counts of assault in the second degree, and 27 counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree. At trial, he was represented by the Cleveland, Ohio, criminal defense lawyer, William L. Summers. On appeal, in Case No. 1988-CA-1635, Judge Anthony M. Wilhoit of the Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed Mahoney&#x27;s conviction for drunk driving on the grounds that it constituted double jeopardy under the Kentucky Constitution, ruling that the 27 counts of manslaughter in the second degree subsumed the drunk-driving conviction. The court ruled that, under Kentucky law, the elements of drunk driving were substantially similar to those of manslaughter. This meant that Mahoney&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license could be reinstated, even during his imprisonment. The Kentucky Supreme Court subsequently reversed this line of reasoning in another case, &quot;Justice v. Commonwealth&quot;, 987 S.W.2d 306 (Ky. December 17, 1998). On May 6, 1992, the Kentucky Supreme Court denied review of Mahoney&#x27;s appeal in Case No. 1992-SC-98.

At the Kentucky State Reformatory, Mahoney worked in the medium-security facility as a clerk. He earned his GED high school equivalency diploma and attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Described by authorities as a model prisoner, Mahoney reduced his incarceration by six years with good behavior, known under Kentucky law as &quot;good time&quot; credit. He declined the Kentucky Parole Board&#x27;s parole recommendation and served out his sentence, before leaving the prison in La Grange, on September 1, 1999, having served nine and a half years. Local television stations broadcast video of him walking out of the prison.

That week, according to a published account in &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; (Louisville), some survivors of the crash and families of the victims had said that they were willing to forgive Mahoney although the disaster marked forever the congregation of the First Assembly of God, which had many members on the bus. &quot;I feel a little bit sorry for him&quot;, Katrina Henderson, then 23, told &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; in 1998. &quot;He didn&#x27;t wake up one day and say &#x27;I&#x27;m going to kill 27 people.&#x27; That&#x27;s not to take any blame away from him. I think that he is a person who made some very bad choices and he paid for those choices&quot;, said Henderson, who was age 12 when she survived the wreck. The victims were members of a church, and many felt called by their religious beliefs to forgive him.

During his trial, the idea was discussed that Mahoney could save lives by talking to school groups, but Mahoney has so far declined.

According to a story by &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; in 2003, Mahoney was living in quiet, self-imposed obscurity in rural Owen County, Kentucky, about from the crash site.

==Aftermath==
===Changes in Kentucky===

Shortly after the collision, governor Wallace Wilkinson ordered his cabinet to review the state&#x27;s drunk driving laws and bus safety regulations. At a news conference on May 20, 1988, Wilkinson announced stricter enforcement of drunk driving by the state, including police sobriety checkpoints and more frequent inspections by state Alcoholic Beverage Control. The governor also indicated support for increased safety standards for buses and training for bus drivers, and the state began offering free safety inspections for privately owned buses.

Kentucky now requires all school buses to have nine emergency exits—more than any other federal or state standard. This includes front and back doors, a side door, four emergency windows and two roof exits. The bus that crashed at Carrollton had only front and back exits, which was to be expected, since the bus was built days before tougher standards were enacted.

Buses used by Kentucky schools must also have a cage around the fuel tank, a stronger frame and roof to resist crumpling on impact and rollover, high-backed seats, extra seat padding, a fuel system that slows leaks, flame-retardant seats and floors, reflective tape on all emergency exits, an wide black band with the district name in white letters on the side, and strobe lights on the exterior. Schools also must have a diesel-powered fleet. (Unlike gasoline, diesel fuel is not highly flammable.)

In 1991, Kentucky enacted stricter drunk driving laws.

===School bus and church bus standards and regulations===
A contributing factor to the crash itself and the severity seemed to be loopholes between the laws and procedures for a school bus and those involving the same vehicle after it was released from school service, but continued to be used for transporting passengers in non-school use. (Had the bus been built new in March 1977 for the non-school use such as a church activity bus, the applicable federal motor vehicle standards in place at that time would have required it to have been built with more emergency exits than were required for school buses). One of the NTSB recommendations after the Carrollton Bus Disaster was that school buses have no fewer emergency exits than required of non-school buses.

Some states also require that the usually different seating capacities for children and adults be displayed near the service door of school buses and non-school buses. Most states consider secondary school (middle and high school) age students to be adults with regards to the space occupied in bus seats and aisles by their bodies.

===MADD and drunk-driving prevention===

The collision riveted the nation&#x27;s attention on the problem of drunken driving as never before and has been credited in part with causing the steady decline in the number of alcohol-related fatalities. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a grassroots organization, worked both before and after the Carrollton crash to reduce the hazards created by drunk (or drinking) drivers.

One of the victims, the youngest killed on the fatal bus, was ten-year-old Patricia &quot;Patty&quot; Susan Nunnallee. Patty&#x27;s mother, Karolyn Nunnallee, became an active member of MADD after the crash, eventually becoming MADD&#x27;s national president. Patty&#x27;s mother wrote on MADD&#x27;s memorial web page to Patty: &quot;They were traveling on a school bus, so I thought she&#x27;d be safe&quot;.

Janey Fair, whose 14-year-old daughter Shannon was killed, become a national volunteer for MADD, and rose within the organization to become national vice president. She was also head of the Kentucky Victims Coalition. According to the MADD website, &quot;MADD helped me find my inner strength and see that life could go on,&quot; Janey said. &quot;I have found I can make real changes in people&#x27;s attitudes about drinking and driving and in how our government addresses this critical problem. Additionally, I can help other victims move forward in their lives.&quot; Her husband also became active locally in MADD.

Joy Williams, wife of Lee Williams, a pastor of the church, and their two young daughters, Kristen and Robin, were among those killed. Dotty Pearman&#x27;s husband, John Pearman, associate pastor at the church and the bus driver, was also killed while their daughter, Christy, was involved in the crash and survived. In the year after the crash, Lee Williams and Dotty Pearman, who barely knew each other before the crash, became friends and eventually married. Lee and Dotty Williams also volunteer for MADD.

==Memorials==
Ford Motor Company paid for a black marble memorial in North Hardin Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Radcliff, Kentucky. The stone lists the names of all of the persons who were aboard the bus during the crash. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet has two small signs, one in each direction of I-71, reading &quot;SITE OF FATAL BUS CRASH MAY 14, 1988&quot; at the site of the crash.

Quinton Higgins, one of the survivors of the crash, created a memorial and anti-drunk driving message using a similar bus to the one in the collision, with the photos of the twenty-seven deceased students and the message &quot;Twenty-seven reasons not to drink and drive&quot; affixed to it.

==Depiction in media==
Among the many media agencies that provided thorough coverage, &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; of Louisville, Kentucky, received the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for General News Reporting for its coverage.

The collision and its aftermath, including efforts of some of the families to obtain more than financial settlements, were chronicled by author James S. Kunen in his 1994 book &quot;Reckless Disregard: Corporate Greed, Government Indifference, and the Kentucky School Bus Crash&quot;.

In 2013, MADD produced a documentary about the crash titled &quot;Impact: After the Crash&quot;.

<text>WhatPulse is a key-counting program that monitors computer uptime, bandwidth usage and the number of keystrokes and mouse clicks made by a user over a period of time. Unlike keyloggers, the authors claim WhatPulse does not record the order in which keys are pressed but instead counts the number of times keys are pressed. As of March 7, 2023, over 380,000+ users are active on WhatPulse.

==Features==
The software tracks a user&#x27;s pressed keys, mouse clicks and used bandwidth and the uptime of the system. Periodically, the user can upload to the server the number of keystrokes made; this is called &quot;pulsing&quot;. Users can see where they are in a leaderboard of people who have joined the program and compare themselves against people from their own countries. Users can also join teams, which enables them to compare themselves against people with similar interests.

The program also has anti-cheat measures in place. Automated measures against cheating include a 50 keys per second maximum.

==Platform compatibility==
WhatPulse is a freeware cross-platform application, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, the Mac and Linux clients were not always updated as often as the Windows client. This changed in version 2.0, which became available for all platforms at the same time and aims at letting the client act the same across all platforms.

<text>Liliw, officially the Municipality of Liliw (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 39,491 people.

Liliw is perhaps best known for its cold water spring resorts, native homemade sweets and a sizeable shoe industry that rivals that of Marikina. The town is also known for its baroque church and its Liliw-style houses.

The local government is currently undertaking means to conserve its cultural heritage sites and has proposed to enact a legislation that would mandate the usage of the Liliw-style architecture as the only means of construction and re-construction in the town. If the ordinance passes, Liliw will have a greater chance to become a heritage town, and further support from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.

==History==

Founded in 1571 by Gat Tayaw, the small town of Liliw is nestled at the foot of Mount Banahaw, away from Santa Cruz, Laguna&#x27;s capital.

According to a story, Liliw got its name from a bird. It was said that Gat Tayaw and his followers decided to erect a bamboo pole and to name the town after the bird that would first alight at the top of the pole within four days. A crow, however, was the first bird to alight on the pole. A crow was considered bad and so Gat Tayaw and his men moved south and erected another bamboo pole. A beautiful bird alighted on the pole and sang, &quot;Liw, Liw, Liw&quot;. Thus the town became Liliw.

This is supported by Tagalog dictionary written by Fr. Noceda and Fr. San Lucar, under the dictionary entry &#x27;lilio&#x27; stating &quot;a type of bird, from which the town in Laguna under the Franciscan monks is named after.&quot;

The spelling of the town&#x27;s name from Lilio was changed on June 11, 1965, when the municipal council passed Resolution No. 38-S-65 which declared “Liliw” as the official name and spelling of the town. This was to avoid confusion in pronouncing and spelling the name of the town.

== Economy ==
The town&#x27;s main attraction is its growing footwear industry. It started in 1931 when Casiano Pisueña became interested in making slippers. His first prototype was made from coconut husk and rubber from tire interiors. He soon became successful and many residents of Liliw followed suit. At present there are about 50 stores selling footwear in Liliw. The regular slippers are still the most popular, but many stores are now selling shoes, handbags and other leather goods. Most stores still carry the three-for-P100 slippers. The annual Tsinelas Festival is celebrated every end of April.

==Transportation==
Tricycles and jeepneys are popular modes of transportation in Liliw. Buses are available to Santa Cruz, Calamba, and Metro Manila.

How to get there
Liliw is 110 kilometers from Manila via Santa Cruz and 105 kilometers via San Pablo.

For those taking public transport, there are buses in Cubao in Quezon City, Buendia in Makati/Pasay, and Alabang in Muntinlupa going to either Santa Cruz or San Pablo. Travel time from Manila is about two hours. Upon arriving in either Santa Cruz or San Pablo, take a jeepney going to Liliw.

Those bringing private vehicles have several options. The trip to Liliw can be combined with Nagcarlan and Majayjay using the San Pablo route or with Pagsanjan and Lake Caliraya using the Santa Cruz route. If it&#x27;s summer, avoid the Santa Cruz route as traffic at the Pansol area can become horrible.

The route via San Pablo starts in Manila, enters South Luzon Expressway and exits from Santo Tomas. From there, continue driving to Alaminos town, then enter city of San Pablo, turn left to Rizal, continue driving via Nagcarlan before finally arriving in Liliw.

Liliw is known for its baroque style church whose façade is made of striking red bricks. Known as St. John the Baptist church, its first church was built in wood in 1620. The stronger stone church was built from 1643 to 1646. The present church patio has been developed to promote Catholic teachings. Standing in front of the church are several elevated statues of different saints that are patrons of each of the town&#x27;s barangays (villages).

Standing next to the municipal hall is the statue of Gat Tayaw. On Gat Tayaw and P. Burgos streets still stand the ancestral houses of many of Liliw&#x27;s prominent families who got rich during the American time from agricultural products like copra, lanzones, banana, and vegetables like tomatoes and mustasa.

Liliw also has many natural attractions like the Kilangin Falls and the colds springs of Batis ng Liliw and Liliw Resort.

<text>Kirk Wesley Rueter ( ; born December 1, 1970), nicknamed &quot;Woody&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily for the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the Montreal Expos who had drafted him in 1991.

==Early life and education==
Rueter was born in Centralia, Illinois, grew up in Hoyleton, Illinois, and graduated from Nashville Community High School in Nashville, Illinois, in 1988. He attended and played for Murray State University.

==Baseball career==
===Montreal Expos===
Drafted by the Montreal Expos in , Rueter broke into the majors in at twenty-two years old and posted an 8-0 record in 14 starts. He pitched for the Expos through the 1996 season and compiled an overall 25-12 record. He would also go on to be the last player in the Nationals/Expos organization to wear the number 42 before its league-wide retirement the following season.

===San Francisco Giants===
On July 30, 1996, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants along with Tim Scott for Mark Leiter. Rueter blossomed into one of the Giants&#x27; most dependable starters. The following season, Rueter pitched in his first full season and to great success, going 13-6 with a 3.45 ERA in 32 starts with a career high 115 K&#x27;s. In 1998, despite achieving a career high 16 victories, Rueter&#x27;s ERA rose from the previous season, finishing with a 4.36 in 187+ innings.

In 1999, backed with a lot of run support, Rueter reached 15 wins despite posting an ERA of 5.41, while also serving 28 home runs.

In 2000, Rueter was the first pitcher to start a major league game at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco. By the end of the season, Rueter bounced back to post an ERA of 3.96, while also collecting 11 wins. For many fans, Rueter&#x27;s defining moment as a Giant was his gutsy bullpen performance in Game 2 of the NLDS, where he relieved starter Shawn Estes after Estes sprained his ankle on a baserunning play.

, a year which saw a Giants&#x27; World Series appearance, was statistically Rueter&#x27;s best year. He went 14-8 with a 3.23 ERA. Rueter was the pitcher in Game 4 of the 2002 World Series; he went six innings, allowing three earned runs. Rueter also pitched shutout ball in relief of Liván Hernández in Game 7 of the 2002 Series, but the Giants failed to score enough runs to come back.

In 2003, despite posting a record of 10-5 in 27 starts, Rueter had an ERA of 4.53 and went through control problems throughout the season, recording 47 walks while striking out just 41.

He began to struggle in with a 9-12 record and a 4.73 ERA, while continuing with his control issues from the previous season. Despite starting 33 games for the Giants, Rueter issued 66 walks while striking out 56.

In , after posting a 2-7 record and 5.95 ERA, the Giants designated him for assignment. His nine-year tenure in San Francisco ended with some controversy, as Rueter complained about having to pitch out of the bullpen and only pitching three times in his last 41 days as a Giant. Rueter&#x27;s trademarks were his fast-paced pitching style and his large ears.

On March 6, 2006, Rueter announced his retirement from the game after 13 seasons. He retired as the Giants franchise record holder for career wins by a left-handed pitcher in the San Francisco Era (since broken by Madison Bumgarner), with 105 of his 130 career wins in a Giants uniform. Rueter has the 20th most wins all-time in Giants franchise history. He is the third all-time in wins during the San Francisco Era. He made the third most career starts in San Francisco Giants history. Only Juan Marichal and Gaylord Perry had more career starts and wins. The Giants honored Rueter&#x27;s career during pregame ceremonies on &quot;Kirk Rueter Day&quot; at SBC Park on August 19, 2006, by giving Rueter a lifesize bobblehead of his likeness and giving him and his family a trip to Hawaii.

==Scouting report==
Rueter was primarily a control and changeup pitcher. His fastball rarely hit 90 mph. He threw changeups, fastballs, sinkers, curveballs, cut fastballs, and sliders. He also was an exceptional fielder, ranking highly in defensive metrics throughout his career. He posted a career .988 fielding percentage with only seven errors in 581 total chances covering 1918 innings.

Some credited the effects of the QuesTec umpiring system to his decline, because Rueter&#x27;s success came mostly from being able to &quot;paint the corners&quot; of the strike zone and the system effectively took that ability away from him because it encouraged umpires to call a tighter strike zone. Rueter was never a strikeout pitcher; he struck out more than a hundred batters in a season only twice in his career. Former teammate Rich Aurilia said, &quot;He was very, very capable of winning with his stuff because he had confidence in what he could do. He always pitched to what his strengths were.&quot;

==Personal life==
Rueter resides in Nashville, Illinois, with his wife and two daughters and his home is famous for its &quot;Shed&quot;, a large recreational facility filled with games and sports memorabilia. Rueter also resided at the Shed during the off-seasons of his playing career. When the San Francisco Giants made trips to St. Louis during the baseball season, Rueter invited the team to relax at his Shed.

Although Rueter never attended the University of North Carolina, he is a fan of Tar Heels basketball. He also serves as an MLB coach at the Gaetti Sports Academy, in Centralia, Illinois.

<doc id="1272161" wikidata="Q14708361" url="?curid=1272161" title="Mayville State University">
<text>Mayville State University (MSU or MaSU) is a public university in Mayville, North Dakota. It is part of the North Dakota University System.

==History==
Founded as a normal school by provision of the North Dakota Constitution in 1889, Mayville State was granted and organized by the first Legislative Assembly.

Classes began in 1889, with funds for the current Old Main a building provided by the Second Legislative Assembly in early 1891, where classes were initially held in 1894. In 1926, the State Board of Higher Education authorized Mayville State to grant a Bachelor of Arts in education. The Mayville Normal School thus became Mayville State Teacher&#x27;s College, providing general education and offering a four-year degree. Successive additions strengthened the curriculum; and as enrollment grew, new buildings appeared.

In 1948, the B.A. in Education became a B.S. in Education and the first non-teaching Bachelor of Arts was offered in 1961. In 1973 and 1982, Mayville State College established programs in business administration and computer studies respectively. In the early 1980s, the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of General Studies became available. The present name, Mayville State University, was approved by the legislature in 1987.

== Campus ==
In 1985, multiple campus buildings were recognized by the National Register of Historic Places with the creation of the Mayville Historic District.

On April 9, 2010, the university broke ground on &quot;the first state funded building in more than 40 years.&quot; Agassiz Hall, the largest residence hall has been remodeled to provide suite- and apartment-style living accommodations for men and women. An addition to the science and library buildings is providing a new home for the Division of Education and Psychology. Great progress continues to be made on a state-funded HPER project, which involves replacement of the 1929 Old Gymnasium and expansion of classroom and lab/practice space for Sports Management, Fitness and Wellness, Health Education, and Physical Education majors.

==Athletics==
The Mayville State athletic teams are called the Comets. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as a member of the North Star Athletic Association (NSAA) as a founding member since the 2013–14 academic year. The Comets previously competed as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) from 2011–12 to 2012–13; and in these defunct conferences: the Dakota Athletic Conference (DAC) from 2000–01 to 2010–11; and the North Dakota College Athletic Conference (NDCAC) from 1922–23 to 1999–2000.

Mayville State competes in six intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball and football; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, softball and volleyball.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
The Mayville State Comets men&#x27;s basketball team finished runner-up at the NAIA Division II Men&#x27;s Basketball National Tournament in 2007. This is the only men&#x27;s basketball team in North Dakota history to play in a national collegiate championship game. Head coach Darren lead the team to back to back to back tournament championships.

===Softball===
Mayville State&#x27;s softball team appeared in one Women&#x27;s College World Series in 1976.
===Volleyball===
Mayville State volleyball made a national tournament appearance in 2021. The program has had several all-american players. The newest All American includes Honorable Mention Elora Passa.

<text>Castrol Limited is a British oil company that markets industrial and automotive lubricants, offering a wide range of oil, greases and similar products for most lubrication applications. The company was originally named CC Wakefield; the name &quot;Castrol&quot; was originally just the brand name for CC Wakefield&#x27;s motor oils, but the company eventually changed its name to &quot;Castrol&quot; when the product name became better-known than the original company name.

Since 2000, Castrol Limited has been a subsidiary of BP, which acquired the company for $4.73 billion.

== History ==
The &quot;Wakefield Oil Company&quot; was founded by Charles Wakefield in Cheapside, London in 1899. Wakefield had previously 
left a job at Vacuum Oil to start a new business selling lubricants for trains and heavy machinery. 
Eight Vacuum Oil employees joined Wakefield, and the company launched its first lubricant in 1906.

In early 20th century, Wakefield Co. developed lubricants especially suited for automobiles and aeroplanes. The brand &quot;Castrol&quot; originated after researchers added measured amounts of castor oil (a vegetable oil derived from castor beans) to their lubricant formulations.
By 1960, the name of the motor oil had eclipsed the company&#x27;s name itself so &quot;CC Wakefield &amp; Company&quot; became &quot;Castrol Limited&quot;. In 1966, Castrol was acquired by company Burmah Oil, which was renamed &quot;Burmah-Castrol&quot;. Burmah-Castrol was purchased by London-based multinational BP (then, &quot;BP Amoco plc&quot;) in 2000.

At the time of purchase, Burmah-Castrol had a turnover of nearly £3 billion with operating profits of £284 million. The company also had 18,000 employees worldwide, with operations in 55 countries. Respectively, BP Amoco had 80,400 employees worldwide and revenues of more than £63 billion.

While Burmah&#x27;s operations folded into the group, Castrol has remained as a subsidiary of BP.

==Products==
=== Lubricants ===
Castrol is a leading manufacturer of lubricants and offers a broad range of products for various applications. The exact names of the product groups and types are :

Passenger car engine oils:

* Edge
* Magnatec
* GTX

Commercial vehicle engine oils:

* Vecton
* RX
* CRB

Automatic transmission fluids, differential and axle fluids, manual transmission fluids:

* Transmax
* Transynd
* Syntrax

=== Others ===

Some steam locomotives were fitted with one or more Wakefield mechanical lubricators. These were normally mounted on the locomotive footplate alongside the boiler, in a position where a mechanical linkage could be made with some point on the locomotive&#x27;s valve gear or another moving part. The reciprocation of this caused a lever on the lubricator to oscillate, and this was converted to a small rotary movement by a ratchet. The gradual rotation caused a small amount of lubricating oil to be fed into pipes leading to the cylinders, valves and other parts. The amount of oil fed was in proportion to the distance travelled by the locomotive in either direction.

==Sponsorship==
===Motorsport===

The brand has been involved in Formula One for many years, supplying to a number of teams, including McLaren (1979–1980 and 2017), Williams (1997–2005), Team Lotus (1992–1993), Brabham (1983–1984), Sauber (1994-early 1995), Jaguar (2002–2004), Renault/Alpine (2017–2025), Audi (2026 onwards) and Walter Wolf Racing.

Castrol has sponsored the Ford World Rally Team and M-Sport in the World Rally Championship since 2003, and the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT factory team from 2016, to 2019. It has also sponsored Volkswagen Motorsport activities in the Dakar Rally and later the World Rally Championship since 2005. Audi Sport&#x27;s activities in rallying and touring car racing have been sponsored by Castrol, as well as its Le Mans Prototypes program since 2011. BMW Motorsport was sponsored by Castrol from 1999 to 2014.

Toyota Motorsport had Castrol sponsorship in the World Rally Championship from 1993 to 1999, and Hyundai Motorsport did so from 2000 to 2002. Also, the Honda factory team at the World Touring Car Championship had Castrol sponsorship from 2012 to 2020.

In the All-Japan Grand Touring Championship, the 1997 championship-winning TOM&#x27;S Toyota Supra (famous from the Gran Turismo series by Polyphony Digital) and later the Mugen Honda NSX had Castrol sponsorships.

In North America, Castrol has been an active sponsor of NHRA drag racing. Castrol sponsored John Force Racing under the GTX brand from 1987 until the end of the 2014 season. Also, the All American Racers had Castrol sponsorship in the CART World Series from 1996 to 1999. In 2014, Castrol sponsored former Indy 500-winning IndyCar team Bryan Herta Autosport, with English rookie Jack Hawksworth behind the wheel.

Castrol is the name sponsor of Castrol Raceway, a multi-track oval, drag, and motocross racing facility in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Castrol is the sponsor of D. J. Kennington in the NASCAR Canada Series and NASCAR Cup Series.

In Australia, Castrol has a long history with the Supercars category, and between 1993 and 2005, Castrol was the title sponsor of Perkins Engineering. It also sponsored Longhurst Racing between 1995 and 1999, Ford Performance Racing between 2007 and 2009, and Paul Morris Motorsport in 2010. In conjunction with a multi-year series sponsorship, between 2014 - 2016 several race events acquired Castrol naming rights including the Castrol Edge Townsville 500 and the Castrol Gold Coast 600. Castrol was the title sponsor of Team Bray, owned by Australian drag car legend, Victor Bray for 17 years.

Castrol was the main sponsor of the Castrol International Rally in Canberra for 11 years between 1976 and 1986. The same was true for an International Rally held in South Africa, ending annually in neighbouring Swaziland. It was the most prestigious event on the South African rally calendar at the time, until Castrol ended its sponsorship of this event. Later only some competitors&#x27; cars were carrying the bright green and red colours of Castrol sponsorship in national rally events, notably the S.A. Toyota dealer team.

In 2019, Castrol extended their sponsorship activities by re-forming a partnership with Jaguar, this time supporting them in Formula E and also NASCAR Cup Series giants RFK Racing-Ford since 2020 season due to Ford&#x27;s commercial relationship with BP plc.

Castrol also briefly made an appearance in 1993 with Nissan in the British Touring Car Championship, where Keith O&#x27;Dor managed to win the 9th round of the season at Silverstone with his teammate Win Percy taking 2nd.

===American football===
Castrol advertising has been a part of telecasts of the National Football League for years. In 2011, Castrol&#x27;s Edge brand became the official motor oil sponsor for the league, renewed until the 2017 season.

=== Cricket ===
The Castrol Cricket Index is a dynamic indicator of the overall performance of a cricket team. It is calculated by taking into consideration the batting momentum, the bowling efficiency, the performance of the teams in the quick start overs and the extreme performance overs and many other factors. Castrol Cricket also ranks cricketers based on their overall performance. India centric initiatives being undertaken like Castrol World Cup ka Hero was created during the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

=== Rugby Union ===
In 2011, Castrol signed a four-year sponsorship deal for the Australian national rugby union team and as the naming rights sponsor of The Rugby Championship.

=== Football ===
From 1995 until 1997, Castrol were also the shirt sponsors of English Football League side Swindon Town.

==Advertising==

Castrol products are still marketed under the red, white and green colour scheme that dates from the launch of Castrol motor oil in 1909. Advertisements for Castrol oil historically featured the slogan &quot;Castrol – liquid engineering&quot;. This was more recently refreshed and reintroduced as &quot;It&#x27;s more than just oil. It&#x27;s liquid engineering.&quot;

For many years, the opening notes of the second &quot;Nachtmusik&quot; movement of Mahler&#x27;s Seventh Symphony were used as the signature theme of Castrol TV commercials.

Wakefield vehicles advertised the company and Castrol on their sides; models of them were made by Dinky Toys, and in later times became sought-after collectors&#x27; items. One example from 1934 to 1935, in very good to excellent condition, was estimated to fetch £1,000-£1,500 at auction in 2016.

<doc id="1272199" wikidata="Q913320" url="?curid=1272199" title="Survivor (Destiny's Child album)">
<text>Survivor is the third studio album by American girl group Destiny&#x27;s Child. It was released on April 25, 2001, by Columbia Records. As their breakthrough second studio album &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; (1999) became a rising commercial success, Destiny&#x27;s Child faced the controversial departure of original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, who were replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams, in February 2000. Soon afterwards, they commenced production of their third studio album, tentatively titled &quot;Independent Women&quot;.

Mere five months after joining, Franklin departed from the group in July, and &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot; was subsequently released as a single from the accompanying soundtrack for the film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000). The song became a global commercial success and the group&#x27;s third US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single. Retitling the album &quot;Survivor&quot; in reference to the turmoil surrounding their line-up alterations, Destiny&#x27;s Child enlisted producers such as Anthony Dent, Damon Elliott, Mark J. Feist, Rob Fusari and Keybeats alongside Beyoncé Knowles, who produced all and co-wrote nearly all of the album&#x27;s tracks. Their final product was an R&amp;B and pop record incorporating genres such as dance, funk and hip hop. Its lyrical themes explore dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships.

Upon its release, &quot;Survivor&quot; received generally positive reviews, mostly aimed at its production, while its balladry, length and lyrical content ignited criticism. Retrospective critical commentaries have credited the record for its impact on mainstream music of the 2000s and for serving as foundation for Knowles&#x27; eventual solo career. A global commercial success, the album debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 units, becoming Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s first and only number-one studio album on the chart. It has gone on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), the album was nominated for Best R&amp;B Album. By 2004, it had sold over 12 million copies worldwide, being among the best-selling girl group albums of all time.

&quot;Survivor&quot; produced four singles. Its title track peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached the top ten in 18 additional countries. In 2002, it won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. &quot;Bootylicious&quot; became Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s fourth US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single and attained international success. &quot;Emotion&quot; became a US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-ten hit in the wake of the September 11 attacks, while &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; was released only overseas and achieved moderate success. The album was further promoted with the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour (2001) and the Destiny&#x27;s Child World Tour (2002). After the latter&#x27;s conclusion, the group embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released a solo studio album to varying levels of success.

==Background and development==
In July 1999, Destiny&#x27;s Child released their second studio album &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot;. Their breakthrough record, it debuted at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 133,000 units. In December, LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson tried to split with Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s manager Mathew Knowles, claiming that he was keeping too much of the group&#x27;s profits and that he favored his daughter Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland. When the accompanying music video for &quot;Say My Name&quot; premiered in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that they were being replaced with Michelle Williams, a former backing vocalist for Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer-actress. On March 15, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. Following the lawsuit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media. However, the group&#x27;s prominence and commercial success burgeoned, aided by &quot;Say My Name&quot;, which peaked atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; subsequently registered a significant rise in sales, ascending towards a new peak at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In July 2000, it was announced that Franklin had departed Destiny&#x27;s Child mere five months after joining. According to the group, Franklin missed a handful of promotional appearances and concerts and was asked to leave the group. However, Franklin stated that she quit because of negative energy within the group and her inability to assert any control in decision-making. The group had already begun recording material for their third studio album, with Franklin performing backing vocals on several tracks. Among those was &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which was recorded for the accompanying soundtrack for the 2000 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. The song was released as a single on August 29. A global commercial success, it became the group&#x27;s third US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and first UK Singles Chart number-one single. It was nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Beyoncé and Rowland in exchange for a settlement, though they continued the action against Mathew Knowles. As part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from speaking about each other publicly.

==Recording and production==

The recording sessions for &quot;Survivor&quot; commenced in May 2000 at the SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston, where most of the album was recorded. &quot;Gospel Medley&quot;, which Destiny&#x27;s Child had previewed during several public appearances throughout 2000, was also recorded there; the group decided to record it due to their longtime affinity for gospel. As on the group&#x27;s previous records, their manager Mathew Knowles served as the executive producer. Initial tracks recorded for the album were in the vein of &quot;Jumpin&#x27;, Jumpin&#x27;&quot;, which was released as the fourth and final single from &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; within that period, to tremendous commercial success. However, as the recording progressed, the group gradually added more depth to their work as there were &quot;so many people copping [their] sound, it was necessary to change things up a bit.&quot; After emerging as the focal point of Destiny&#x27;s Child, Knowles assumed more control by taking a greater hand in songwriting and even producing some of the album herself. Knowles&#x27; intention was not to monopolize the spotlight; however, she did co-write 17 and produce all of the album&#x27;s 18 tracks. She explained: &quot;I only wanted to do like three songs... The label kept saying &quot;Do another song, do another song, do another song&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t planned. It wasn&#x27;t like I said, OK, I&#x27;m going to take charge.&quot; However, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams co-wrote only one track–&quot;Outro (DC-3) Thank You&quot;. On July 20, Farrah Franklin departed from Destiny&#x27;s Child, having already recorded backing vocals for several tracks, including &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;. The group embarked on Christina Aguilera&#x27;s tour Christina Aguilera in Concert as an opening act on July 31, touring until October and simultaneously recording the album. Six songs, including both parts to &quot;Independent Women&quot;, &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; and the unreleased &quot;I Tried&quot;, had been recorded by September.

Originally, the Keybeats-produced &quot;Independent Women Part II&quot; was recorded first as the song&#x27;s album version, while the track which would become &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot; served as a remix. However, their roles were reversed as the group was offered to record material for the accompanying soundtrack to &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000), a film adaption of the 1976–1981 television series of the same title. They re-recorded &quot;Independent Women&quot; and enlisted first-time collaborators Trackmasters to produce the track, altering the original&#x27;s lyrics to suit the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; theme. Cory Rooney, who co-wrote and produced the re-recording, said it took only 15 minutes for him and the Trackmasters to create the instrumental track. Aside from the SugarHill Recording Studios, part one was recorded at the Lobo Studios in Deer Park, New York and the TK Studios in Honolulu, while part two was recorded at the Chung King Studios in New York City and the 24/7 Studios in Houston. The Anthony Dent-produced title track was inspired by a pun a radio station had made about the fact that three members had already left Destiny&#x27;s Child, comparing the group to the reality competition television series &quot;Survivor&quot;. Knowles felt inspired to use the negative comment and turn its context positive by writing a song out of it. According to Williams, the song was recorded from September to November. It was recorded at the Chase Studios in Atlanta–where fellow Dent production was also recorded–and, alongside numerous other tracks, at the Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California.
Beyoncé claimed to have written &quot;Bootylicious&quot; on a plane flight to London while listening to the song &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; by Stevie Nicks, when the word &quot;bootylicious&quot; popped into her head. Rob Fusari disputed the claim in 2010, stating he himself had the idea for the song and had wanted to use a guitar riff from Survivor&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; but, after not being able to find it, used a similar riff from &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;. However, in 2016, he revealed that after the &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; sample was approved, he conceived the song with Beyoncé over the phone, adding: &quot;She was out of the country at that point, but she had the &#x27;Bootylicious&#x27; concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record.&quot; Once the group decided to record &quot;Bootylicious&quot;, Fusari wanted to remove the sample, explaining: &quot;I figured I&#x27;d put the guitar loop on there temporarily, and later go into the studio with a guitar and replay it, because I&#x27;d learned, after sampling Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;I Wish&quot; for Will Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wild Wild West,&quot; that I didn&#x27;t want to lose 50% of the publishing. I vividly remember telling Mathew Knowles, &quot;Mathew, you got to book me into your studio and let me replay that riff.&quot; It was Guitar 101! One note!&quot;; however, Knowles refused. Dan Workman, who engineered several tracks from &quot;Survivor&quot;, commented on the recording sessions: &quot;Beyoncé would be driving over to the studio listening to all these tracks that had been sent to her, and she would pick out her favorite. When she got here, she would immediately start writing lyrics for the song and finish it right there in front of me. For the song &quot;Bootylicious&quot; she wrote all the lyrics for it right in [SugarHill Recording Studios&#x27;] Studio A. Then she taught the song to Kelly and Michelle, and all three of them worked on the vocals together.&quot;

D&#x27;wayne Wiggins, who wrote &quot;Fancy&quot; with Beyoncé and J. R. Rotem, said Destiny&#x27;s Child would carefully select lyrics for the songs, adjusting them to suit the group. According to Wiggins, they would &quot;just take a song and dissect it and put it back together again. For &quot;Fancy,&quot; it took [only] about 30 or 45 minutes to change the hook.&quot; Rotem reflected on the song&#x27;s simple instrumentation, revealing he created beats solely using a keyboard and a drum machine. The song was recorded at the Digital Services in Houston, with additional recording at the House of Music in Oakland, California. Mark J. Feist, who produced &quot;Emotion&quot;, changed the arrangement and production of Samantha Sang&#x27;s disco-soul 1977 original version into a contemporary ballad. Beyoncé would re-record &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; with a modified arrangement for her 2003 debut solo studio album of the same title. Both versions were recorded at the SugarHill Recording Studios, and were written and produced by Beyoncé and Errol McCalla Jr. As &quot;Survivor&quot; neared its completion in December 2000, Destiny&#x27;s Child referred to their hectic schedule while recording the album, revealing they took time off recording solely on Christmas Day. While they intended to complete the album soon afterwards, the recording continued into early 2001, causing the album&#x27;s release date to be postponed and its lead single &quot;Survivor&quot; to be delayed from January to March. During the album&#x27;s production, Rowland recorded her debut solo recording &quot;Angel&quot;. Produced by Beyoncé, Fusari and Falonte Moore–who wrote and produced &quot;Bootylicious&quot;, &quot;Apple Pie à la Mode&quot; and &quot;Happy Face&quot;–the track appeared on the accompanying soundtrack for the 2001 film &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. Previous collaborator Rodney Jerkins, whose production &quot;Say My Name&quot; became one of Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s biggest hits, had also returned to work on &quot;Survivor&quot;. He produced two tracks, including the &quot;street-edgy&quot;, up-tempo &quot;Girl Like Me&quot;, but neither made the final track listing.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Survivor&quot; is predominantly an R&amp;B and pop record exploring genres such as hip hop, funk and dance. Its lyrical themes include dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships. The album opens with the uptempo club track &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which encourages female empowerment and financial independence. As it was recorded for the accompanying soundtrack for &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000), it makes numerous lyrical references to the film. The album&#x27;s title track features looped strings built around an &quot;abrasive&quot; hip hop instrumental. Lyrically, it&#x27;s considered a &quot;prolonged and rather vindictive attack&quot; on the former members of Destiny&#x27;s Child–LeToya Luckett, LaTavia Roberson and Farrah Franklin. The &quot;blinding Prince-like R&amp;B-jazz odyssey&quot; &quot;Bootylicious&quot; features a lyrical response to those who had criticized Beyoncé&#x27;s weight gain, against a prominent guitar riff sample from Stevie Nicks&#x27; 1981 song &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;. &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; features the group &quot;hurling insults at a hip-hop harlot&quot;, while dismissing &quot;classless&quot; women altogether. It features an uncredited interpolation of Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Push It&quot;. Pizzicato string-driven &quot;Fancy&quot; is seen as another diss track directed towards the group&#x27;s former members.

Avant-funk track &quot;Apple Pie à la Mode&quot; features &quot;percolating&quot; beats and harmonies, while the dance track &quot;Sexy Daddy&quot; is infused with discordant harmonies and &quot;thundering&quot; ragga beats. &quot;Independent Women Part II&quot; sonically differs from its counterpart, featuring modified lyrics against a cartoonish bounce background. The &quot;sunny day&quot; pop track &quot;Happy Face&quot; promotes self-esteem; Sylvia Patterson from &quot;NME&quot; classified its genre as &quot;cajun-R&amp;B-yodel-pop&quot;. A string of ballads subsequently appears, including a &quot;slow jam&quot; cover version of Samantha Sang&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Emotion&quot;, as well as the &quot;soft&quot; &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; and the easy listening love song &quot;Brown Eyes&quot;. Brian Hiatt from MTV described the latter as &quot;a gently harmonized love song, with production reminiscent of the Janet Jackson hit &quot;Again.&quot;&quot; &quot;The Story of Beauty&quot; lyrically differs from the rest of &quot;Survivor&quot;, telling a story about a victim of sexual abuse; it was based on a fan who wrote a letter to the group. Beyoncé described it as &quot;a pretty controversial yet realistic song that deals with something that happens in most families that no one wants to talk about.&quot; A cappella gospel track &quot;Gospel Medley&quot; comprises the Beyoncé-written &quot;You&#x27;ve Been So Good&quot;, Kirk Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Now Behold the Lamb&quot;, the Christian hymn &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot;, and Richard Smallwood&#x27;s &quot;Total Praise&quot;. The album closes with &quot;Outro (DC-3) Thank You&quot;, on which the members congratulate, praise and thank each other.

==Title and packaging==
Originally titled &quot;Independent Women&quot; after &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, the album was later retitled &quot;Survivors&quot;, as Destiny&#x27;s Child branded themselves &quot;survivors&quot; in reference to the turmoil that had coincided with the group throughout 2000. The title was later altered to &quot;Survivor&quot;. Beyoncé further explained: &quot;I thought about this joke that this radio station had, and they were saying, &#x27;Oh, Destiny&#x27;s Child is like &quot;Survivor,&quot; trying to see which member is going to last the longest on the island,&#x27; and everyone laughed. I was like, &#x27;Ah, that&#x27;s cute, but you know what? I&#x27;m going to use that negative thing and turn it into a positive thing and try to write a great song out of it.&#x27;&quot;

The cover artwork for &quot;Survivor&quot; was photographed by Rod Spicer, with the group styled by Beyoncé&#x27;s mother Tina Knowles. Biographer Daryl Easlea noted the cover &quot;showing the group now as women rather than the girls of the previous sleeves&quot;. The album&#x27;s booklet included a photograph of the members looking &quot;triumphal&quot; standing on rocks on a desert island, inspired by the reality television series &quot;Survivor&quot;, as a reference to the album&#x27;s title and title track.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Survivor&quot; was originally slated for February 13, 2001, before being postponed to April, and afterwards to its ultimate release date of May 1. Its promotional activities commenced on February 28, when Destiny&#x27;s Child performed the lead single &quot;Survivor&quot; for the first time at the 2001 Soul Train Music Awards. The song was subsequently performed on the April 6 episode of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the United Kingdom, with &quot;Emotion&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on May 5, on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on May 10, and with &quot;Bootylicious&quot; on &quot;Today&quot; on May 11. The group additionally performed the album&#x27;s first three singles &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and &quot;Emotion&quot; on &quot;The Early Show&quot; on June 6. They subsequently opened the inaugural BET Awards with &quot;Bootylicious&quot; on June 19, later performing the song on the August 3 episode of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and the September 7 Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration show. In the meantime, the group had embarked on the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour with 3LW, Dream, Eve and Nelly with the St. Lunatics, which ran throughout North America from July 18 until September 21. Afterwards, their own European tour was scheduled to run from October 24 to November 20, but was postponed in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

Following the tour&#x27;s postponement, Destiny&#x27;s Child performed &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Emotion&quot; and &quot;Gospel Medley&quot; during the benefit concert United We Stand: What More Can I Give, led by Michael Jackson in tribute to victims of the September 11 attacks, on October 21. Within subsequent months, the group focused on the overseas promotion of &quot;Survivor&quot;, performing &quot;Emotion&quot; on the November 23 episode of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the UK and the December 15 episode of &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; in Germany, &quot;Survivor&quot; during the Sanremo Music Festival 2002 in Italy on March 8, and &quot;Bootylicious&quot; at the Logie Awards of 2002 in Australia on April 28. Also, their first remix album, titled &quot;This Is the Remix&quot;, was released on March 12 and included remixes of several tracks from &quot;Survivor&quot; among other tracks; it debuted at number 29 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The postponed Destiny&#x27;s Child World Tour commenced on April 29, being expanded from solely Europe to Oceania and Japan as well, and finished on June 24. Its Rotterdam show was filmed and released via video album &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Child World Tour&quot; on July 8, 2003.

==Singles==

&quot;Survivor&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Survivor&quot; on March 6, 2001, to mixed critical reception. A commercial success, it became Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s fourth consecutive US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-three single, peaking at number two. The digital single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 2020. Internationally, the song reached the summit in Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom, and the top ten in 15 additional countries. Despite a mixed critical response, it won Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), marking Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s third and final Grammy Award win as a group. Its Darren Grant-directed accompanying music video depicts the members as shipwreck survivors on a desert island. The video was released as the group&#x27;s first DVD single, which peaked at number nine on the US Top Music Videos and was certified gold by the RIAA. At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, the video won Best R&amp;B Video, also being nominated for Best Pop Video and Best Group Video.

&quot;Bootylicious&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;Survivor&quot; on May 22, 2001. Commercially, it fared similarly to its predecessor, becoming Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s fourth and final US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single. The digital single was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 2020. Internationally, the song reached the top ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the UK. Its Matthew Rolston-directed accompanying music video showcases the group performing numerous of Michael Jackson&#x27;s choreographies and features Stevie Nicks playing the guitar riff sampled from her song &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;.

&quot;Emotion&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Survivor&quot; on September 4, 2001. A commercial success, it continued Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s streak of US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-ten singles by peaking at number ten after being fueled by post-September 11 attacks airplay. Internationally, it peaked within the top ten in Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa and the UK. Its Francis Lawrence-directed accompanying music video features the members&#x27; respective situations through a triple-split screen; Beyoncé deals with an adulterous boyfriend, Kelly Rowland deals with separation from her boyfriend, while Michelle Williams deals with the death of her grandmother.

&quot;Nasty Girl&quot; was released as the fourth and final single from &quot;Survivor&quot; outside North America on March 4, 2002, to negative critical reception. A moderate commercial success, it peaked at number ten in Australia and within the top 40 in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Its Sanaa Hamri-directed accompanying music video depicts women perceived as &quot;nasty girls&quot; receiving transformations. In 2016, Rob Fusari, who produced several tracks from &quot;Survivor&quot;, revealed &quot;Happy Face&quot; was originally slated as the album&#x27;s final single, but those plans were scrapped due to the song&#x27;s lyrical content being deemed inappropriate in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Survivor&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63 out of 100, based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne praised the record, calling it &quot;the divas&#x27; premature, but inevitable growing pains album.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; commented that &quot;&quot;Survivor&quot; is relentlessly inventive in its recombinations.&quot; Ethan Brown from &quot;New York&quot; was less impressed, writing: &quot;All fifteen tracks are one-dimensional disses and dismissals of scantily clad women, vengeful boyfriends, and the group&#x27;s assorted doubters.&quot; Sylvia Patterson from &quot;NME&quot; summarized the album as &quot;Multi-platinum booty-shakers in boundary-pushing nil-shit-taking exercise&quot;, while highlighting &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;. Natalie Nichols from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as a &quot;generic hip-hop music box of ticking percussion, pulsing bass and uninspiring samples [which] barely allows [Destiny&#x27;s Child] a moment to breathe, let alone stretch out&quot;.

Despite criticizing its length, lyrical content and balladry, Alexis Petridis from &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;Survivor&quot; &quot;has a rare individuality, and a hint of genius, hidden in its grooves&quot;. Nathan Rabin from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; shared Petridis&#x27; negative sentiments, concluding his review by saying: &quot;if the group wants to survive the stormy seas of the pop world for more than a few years, it should call its stable of songwriting wizards ASAP&quot;. In a positive review, Cristín Leach from RTÉ highlighted &quot;The Story of Beauty&quot; while dismissing the album&#x27;s closing tracks &quot;Gospel Medley&quot; and &quot;Outro (DC-3) Thank You&quot;. Laura Sinagra from &quot;Blender&quot; wrote: &quot;Aside from disposable ballads and the sappy &quot;Perfect Man,&quot; &quot;Survivor&quot; blasts haters, child molesters and &quot;been-around-the-block-females,&quot; keeping the blood up as they whup ass.&quot; Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; expressed that &quot;for the most part &quot;Survivor&quot; rises to the occasion, and while the album isn&#x27;t groundbreaking, it at least shows the new trio breaking out on their own.&quot; Rob Sheffield from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album but singled &quot;the self-righteous tone creeping into the songs&quot; out as its sole weakness.

===Listings===
==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;Survivor&quot; debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart dated May 19, 2001, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies. It also debuted atop the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, selling over 87,000 copies at the R&amp;B core stores within its first week. Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s first number-one album on both charts, it registered the highest first-week sales for any Columbia Records artist at the time. Despite a 46% sales decline to 358,979 units, the album remained at the summit in its second week, reaching the one-million sales mark. In its third week, the album descended to number three, selling 221,884 copies; in total, it spent 14 consecutive weeks within the top ten. By the end of 2001, &quot;Survivor&quot; had sold over 3.7 million copies, becoming the seventh best-selling album of the year. It was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 7, 2002. By November 2005, the album had sold over 4.7 million units in the US, being one of the best-selling girl group albums ever in the country. In Canada, the album debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart, spending four weeks at the summit. In October 2003, it was certified quadruple platinum by Music Canada.

Across Europe, &quot;Survivor&quot; reached the summit in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. On the European Top 100 Albums, it debuted at number 49 and peaked atop the chart the following week. In 2001, the record was certified double platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for sales of two million units across Europe. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart, UK R&amp;B Albums Chart and Scottish Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 118,000 copies. It became the first studio album by an American girl group to peak atop the UK Albums Chart and made Destiny&#x27;s Child the second American girl group in history to reach the summit, following The Supremes, who did so with their greatest hits albums &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1967) and &quot;20 Golden Greats&quot; (1977). British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it triple platinum in December 2001.

In Australia, &quot;Survivor&quot; debuted and peaked at number four on the ARIA Top 100 Albums, and was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in December 2001. In New Zealand, it debuted at number ten, ascending towards its peak at number five in its second week. The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) in 2002. In Japan, it peaked at number 12 on the Oricon Albums Chart, being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) in May 2001. In South Africa, the album reached number one and, in 2002, was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry of South Africa (RISA). According to IFPI, &quot;Survivor&quot; was the third best-selling album worldwide of 2001, with 7.8 million copies sold during the year. By November 2004, &quot;Survivor&quot; had sold over ten million copies worldwide, being the fifth best-selling girl group album of all time.

==Controversy==

&quot;Survivor&quot; was a subject of several controversies, albeit less than its predecessor &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; (1999). Rob Fusari, who wrote &quot;Bootylicious&quot;, recalled a dispute with Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s manager and Beyoncé&#x27;s father Mathew Knowles over the song&#x27;s conception. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Beyoncé had discussed how she came up with the idea for the song herself. Upon seeing that, Fusari called Knowles, describing the conversation:
The lyrical content of &quot;Survivor&quot; caused backlash from LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, who had controversially departed from the group in February 2000 and filed a lawsuit against the group and their management soon afterwards. The portion of the lawsuit directed towards Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland had been dropped by the end of the year, with a mutual agreement prohibiting either party involved from making &quot;any public comment of a disparaging nature concerning one another&quot;. Luckett and Roberson contended the line &quot;You thought I wouldn&#x27;t sell without you, sold 9 million&quot; violated the agreement and filed another lawsuit against the group in February 2002, accusing Beyoncé, Rowland and Michelle Williams of making &quot;deliberate disparaging, defamatory factual misrepresentations&quot; in the song, as well as in their statements for the press surrounding the release of &quot;Survivor&quot;. By late July, the parties had reached a settlement out of court.

==Impact and legacy==
Retrospectively, &quot;Survivor&quot; has received mixed to positive critical commentary, with criticism directed towards its lyrical content, and praise towards its thematic impact on mainstream music of the 2000s. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for AllMusic: &quot;&quot;Survivor&quot;, their first album as full-fledged superstars – also their first album since most of the group disappeared due to managerial conflicts – is as contrived and calculated as a Mariah Carey record, only without the joy. This is a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny&#x27;s Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife.&quot; On the contrary, J&#x27;na Jefferson from &quot;Vibe&quot; declared the album &quot;a seminal force in the female empowerment trend of the 21st century, serving as a love letter to body-positive, independent and fierce women all over the globe.&quot; Furthermore, Vincent Anthony from The 97 credited the record for &quot;unbiasedly [melding] R&amp;B inspirations and hip-hop nuances into an unique brand of pop that defined the early 2000s&quot;. From a standpoint concerning pop culture, Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard wrote that the album &quot;helped establish [Destiny&#x27;s Child] as an American institution&quot; in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004). Its second single &quot;Bootylicious&quot; popularized the portmanteau term &quot;bootylicious&quot;, a combination of the words &quot;&quot; and &quot;delicious&quot;, although the term had already been used by Snoop Dogg on Dr. Dre&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody&#x27;s Celebratin&#x27;)&quot; as a pejorative. As Destiny&#x27;s Child brought the term&#x27;s neologism of approval to prominence, it consequently entered the mainstream English language, thus being added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2004, referring to a sexually attractive woman in its definition. Following the September 11 attacks, the lead single &quot;Survivor&quot; received new lyrical interpretations from the public, being called a &quot;tool for national grief in a way to show solidarity and strength&quot;. &quot;Emotion&quot;, which was released as the third single around the time of the attacks, was also branded a &quot;healing song&quot;, which contributed to its commercial success in the United States.

As previously announced, following the completion of promotional duties for &quot;Survivor&quot;, Destiny&#x27;s Child embarked on a hiatus in 2002, in order for its members to release solo albums. Michelle Williams was first to release a solo album, titled &quot;Heart to Yours&quot;, in April 2002. It features the &quot;Gospel Medley&quot; first released on &quot;Survivor&quot;. The critically acclaimed gospel record debuted at number 57 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 17,000 copies and later peaked at number-one on the Top Gospel Albums chart. It became the biggest-selling gospel album of the year, with 220,000 copies sold in the US. At the 2002 MOBO Awards, Wiliams won an award for &quot;Best Gospel Act&quot;, before making her Broadway debut, as the lead in the musical &quot;Aida&quot; in November 2003. Although Beyoncé Knowles&#x27; solo album was initially scheduled for October 2002, its release was postponed due to the success of Kelly Rowland&#x27;s collaboration with Nelly, &quot;Dilemma&quot;. The song reached the summit of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, thus Rowland&#x27;s pop rock-oriented solo debut &quot;Simply Deep&quot; was moved up to October from its original early 2003 release date. &quot;Simply Deep&quot; debuted at number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 77,000 units within its first week and going on to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Dilemma&quot; additionally won Rowland her first Grammy Award outside the group, for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards (2003). Following numerous postponements, Beyoncé was the last to release a solo album. Titled &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot;, it was released in June 2003 to widespread critical acclaim. The album debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and registered the highest first-week sales among the members with 317,000 units. It was preceded by the lead single &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, which spent eight consecutive weeks atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; was followed by &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, which surpassed its predecessor&#x27;s reign at the summit by one week, and the top-five hits &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; and &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;. At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards (2004), &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; and its tracks won five awards, including Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album; Beyoncé consequently tied with Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys and Norah Jones for the record of most Grammy Awards won by a woman at a single ceremony. Following the release of her sixth solo studio album &quot;Lemonade&quot; (2016), Sasha Geffen from MTV claimed &quot;&quot;Survivor&quot; marked [Beyoncé]&#x27;s turning point from musician to global phenomenon&quot;, drawing parallels between lyrical themes of tracks from &quot;Survivor&quot; and those from &quot;Lemonade&quot;.

<doc id="1272219" wikidata="Q487983" url="?curid=1272219" title="Anatoly Alexandrov (physicist)">
<text>Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov (, 13 February 1903 – 3 February 1994) was a Russian physicist who played a crucial and centralizing role in the former Soviet program of nuclear weapons. 

During his lifetime, Alexandrov was the recipient of many honors, civil citations, and state awards for this work and was also the director of the Kurchatov Institute and the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences from 1975 until 1986.

==Early life==
Anatoly Alexandrov was born on 13 February 1903 into a Russian family of a prominent judge in the town of Tarashcha, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine).

In 1919, at the height of the Russian Civil War, Alexandrov graduated from high school in Kiev. The certificate gave the right to enter the university at the physics and mathematics or medical faculty. When the Red Army captured Kiev on February 5, 1919, Alexandrov and a friend were at a dacha in Mlynka. He and his friend encountered an officer of the White Guard, who urged them to enlist. They went to the front with the officer.

At the age of 16, he became a cadet and fought in the Army of Wrangel as a machine gunner, and was awarded three Crosses of St. George. During the evacuation of remnants of the White Guard army from Crimea to Turkey, Alexandrov refused to leave and preferred to stay. As a result, he was captured and sentenced to death, but he narrowly escaped.

==Scientific career==

Later he worked as an assistant at the Kiev Mining Institute as an electrician. He later worked as an electrical engineer at the Kiev Physicochemical Society under the Political Education and a high school teacher in the village of Belki, Kiev region. For several years, he combined his studies at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Kiev University, where he studied from 1924 to 1930, with teaching physics and chemistry at school#79 in Kiev.

After graduating from Faculty of Physics in Kiev University in 1930, he worked at the X-ray Physics Department in the Kiev Institute of Health. After his graduation in 1930, he was invited by Abram Ioffe to join him in Leningrad. At Leningrad Physicotechnical Institute, he developed a statistical theory of strength and doctoral dissertation - &quot;Relaxation in Polymers&quot; (1941).

From the spring of 1931, he worked at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute, where he became a candidate, and then a professor of physical and mathematical sciences.

===World War II===
Alexandrov became prominent during World War II, when he devised in collaboration with Igor Kurchatov a method of demagnetizing ships to protect them from German naval mines, known as the LPTI system. On 9 August 1941, Alexandrov and Kurchatov arrived in Sevastopol to organize work on equipping the Black Sea Fleet ships with the system, and by the end of October it had been installed on more than 50 ships. At the same time, Alexksandrov and Kurchatov continued research to improve it. The method was effective by the end of 1941 and was in active use through the end of the war and afterwards. It was successfully used by the Soviet Navy, during the Siege of Sevastopol, Siege of Leningrad, on the Volga River during the Battle of Stalingrad and in the Baltic Sea campaigns.

===Later career===

Both Alexandrov and Kurchatov worked at the Ioffe Institute by that time (their laboratory separated from the Ioffe Institute and moved to Moscow in 1943 for the work on the Soviet atomic bomb project).

From 1946 to 1955, he was director of the Institute for Physical Problems, where he was appointed to replace Pyotr Kapitsa. In 1955, he became deputy director of the Institute of Atomic Energy, and after the death of Kurchatov in 1960, he became its director. On the initiative of Alexandrov, power plants for the nuclear icebreakers &quot;Lenin&quot;, &quot;Arktika&quot;, and &quot;Sibir&quot; were developed.

Alexandrov was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1962. It was under the leadership of Alexandrov, that technical, organizational and production problems were solved in an unprecedentedly short time during the construction of the USSR&#x27;s first nuclear submarine with a nuclear propulsion system. As a result, in 1952-1972, Sevmash mastered the serial production of submarines with a nuclear propulsion system and became the largest nuclear submarine shipbuilding center in the USSR and the world. At Sevmash, 163 combat submarines were built. In the 1970s, the company produced Typhoon-class nuclear submarines, which entered into the Guinness Book of Records as the largest submarines in the world. 

In the 1960s, on the initiative of Alexandrov, the largest helium liquefaction plant was built in the USSR . This provided a wide front for fundamental research in the physics of low temperatures, as well as on the technical use of superconductivity. He was the scientific supervisor of the project of RBMK reactor plants.
Described by colleagues as a brilliant scientist and organizer, he was deeply affected by the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear accident in history. According to him:

&quot;To manage such an institute as the IAE, the largest institute and the most difficult work, and at the same time take care of the Academy - I must say, it was extremely difficult. In the end it ended sadly. And when the Chernobyl accident happened, I believe that from that time both my life began to end, and my creative life.&quot;

The accident subsequently prompted the Soviet Government to review and suspend the ambitious nuclear power program. As principal designer of the RBMK reactor that exploded at Chernobyl, Alexandrov refused to concede that a design flaw contributed to the disaster.

Alexandrov died of cardiac arrest on 3 February 1994 in Moscow. He is buried at the city&#x27;s Mitinskoe Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Alexandrov was first married to Antonina Mikhailovna Zolotareva, with whom he had a son Yuri, a physicist. Antonina died in 1947. Alexandrov later remarried to Marianna Alexandrovna Balashov. They had a daughter Maria, who became a biologist, and two sons Peter and Alexander. Peter became a physicist and Alexander became a biologist. Marianna died in 1986.

His nephew is Eugene Alexandrov, a Russian physicist and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (since 1992).

<doc id="1272232" wikidata="Q7722338" url="?curid=1272232" title="The Cherry-Tree Carol">
<text>&quot;The Cherry-Tree Carol&quot; (Roud 453) is a ballad with the rare distinction of being both a Christmas carol and one of the Child Ballads (no. 54). The song itself is very old, reportedly sung in some form at the Feast of Corpus Christi in the early 15th century.

==Synopsis==
The ballad relates an apocryphal story of the Virgin Mary, presumably while traveling to Bethlehem with Joseph for the census. In the most popular version, the two stop in a cherry orchard, and Mary asks her husband to pick cherries for her, citing her child. Joseph spitefully tells Mary to let the child&#x27;s father pick her cherries.

At this point in most versions, the infant Jesus, from the womb, speaks to the tree and commands it to lower a branch down to Mary, which it does. Joseph, witnessing this miracle, immediately repents his harsh words. The more contemporary versions sometimes end here, while others often include an angel appearing to Joseph and telling him of the circumstances of Jesus&#x27;s birth. Other versions then jump ahead several years, where the next verse picks up with Jesus on his mother&#x27;s lap, telling her of his eventual death and resurrection.

==Sources==
The story may be derived from the apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, written around the year 650, which combines many earlier apocryphal Nativity traditions; however, in Pseudo-Matthew, the event takes place during the flight into Egypt, and the fruit tree is a palm tree (presumably a Date Palm) rather than a cherry tree. In the apocryphal Gospel, Jesus has already been born and so Joseph&#x27;s truculence is unrelated to any dismay over Mary&#x27;s pregnancy, but has to do with an inability to reach the fruits of the palm and a concern over the family&#x27;s lack of water.

The carol is found in the “N-Town Plays,” performed in the English Midlands around 1500. The song is very similar to a passage in one of the Coventry Mystery Plays. Having developed out of the folk tradition, there are a number of versions of text and tune.

==Recordings==

=== Traditional ===
In the early 1930s, James Madison Carpenter made a recording of an 80 year old man named Henry Thomas from St. Just, Cornwall, England singing a version which came from his great-grandmother who lived in the 1700s; the recording is available online via the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website, along with Carpenter&#x27;s transcriptions of the lyrics and melody. Many other traditional versions have been collected in the last century, such as an audio recording of Bob Arnold of Burford, Oxfordshire, England, and another of Thomas Moran of Mohill, Co. Leitrim, Ireland. 

Alan Lomax recorded three versions in Kentucky in the late 1930s, including from the traditional singer Aunt Molly Jackson, all of which can be heard online. Jean Ritchie, also of Kentucky, recorded two traditional versions with slightly different tunes. The version sung on Ritchie&#x27;s album &quot;Carols for All Seasons&quot; (1959), and later on her sister Edna&#x27;s eponymous LP of traditional songs (1962), later became popular after a recording by Joan Baez.

=== Popular ===
Joan Baez took one of the Kentucky versions, probably from Jean Ritchie or Aunt Molly Jacson, releasing her own rendition in 1961 on the album Joan Baez, Vol. 2 with an added guitar accompaniment, bringing this version of the song mainstream popularity. Various versions of the song have been recorded by Shirley Collins &amp; Davy Graham (also by herself and with The Young Tradition), Marty Haugen, Kacy &amp; Clayton, the Clancy Brothers (as &quot;When Joseph Was an Old Man&quot;), Judy Collins, José Feliciano, Emmylou Harris, Mary Hopkin (as B-side of the single &quot;Mary had a Baby/Cherry Tree Carol&quot;), the King&#x27;s College Choir, Cindy Kallet, Magpie Lane, Mark Lanegan, Colin Meloy, the Chad Mitchell Trio, Nowell Sing We Clear, Pentangle, Angelo Branduardi (two Italian versions: &quot;Il ciliegio&quot; and &quot;Rosa di Galilea&quot;), Peter Paul and Mary, Casey Stratton, Bob Rowe, John Rutter (with the Cambridge Singers), the Poor Clares from New Orleans (&quot;Cherry Tree Carol&quot; on their album &quot;Songs for Midwinter&quot;), Sting (&quot;If on a Winter&#x27;s Night&quot;), Ron Block on his album &quot;Carter&#x27;s Creek Christmas&quot;, Joe Weed, on his album &quot;Prairie Christmas&quot;, and Kerfuffle (as &quot;Cherry Tree Carol&quot; on their Midwinter album &quot;Lighten the Dark&quot;).

<doc id="1272234" wikidata="Q2551359" url="?curid=1272234" title="Ali III ibn al-Husayn">
<text>Ali III ibn al-Husayn ( ; 14 August 1817 – 11 June 1902) commonly known as Ali III Bey () was the Husainid Bey of Tunis from 1882 until his death. He was the first ruler under the French protectorate.

He was named Bey al-Mahalla (Heir Apparent) on 23 August 1863 by his brother Muhammad III as-Sadiq and was made a divisional General and placed at the head of an army column operating in the interior of the country (known in Tunisian Arabic as the &quot;mhalla&quot;) to assert beylical authority in remote regions, rendering justice in the name of the sovereign and collecting taxes from local tribes. A keen horseman, Ali Bey took personal charge of this work and undertook it thoroughly, twice a year - in the north of the country during the summer in Béja and El Kef, and in the south during the winter, in Kairouan and the towns further south. During the Mejba Revolt in 1864, while his ineffective brother remained in the Bardo palace, Ali put down the rebellion with Generals Ahmed Zarrouk, Rustum and Uthman.

Following the French conquest of Tunisia and the signing of the Treaty of Bardo, Ali Bey succeeded his brother Muhammad III as-Sadiq on 29 October 1882. At the same time, he became an honorary Marshal in the army of the Ottoman Empire, as Tunisia was still nominally an Ottoman province. His first act as sovereign was to accept the resignation of his father&#x27;s old mamluk, the minister Mohammed Khaznadar, and replaced him, for the first time in the country&#x27;s history, with a Grand Vizier of native (i.e. non-Turkish) extraction, Mohammed Aziz Bouattour.

On 8 June 1883, together with French Resident General Paul Cambon, he signed the Conventions of La Marsa in which he formally renounced his power while retaining nominal authority., The country remained under the occupation of the French expeditionary force of General Forgemol. The entire administration of the country, as well as control of the army, police and foreign affairs, was taken over by the colonial power.

On 5 April 1885 there was a political crisis arising from Cambon&#x27;s decision to revoke the existing concession to supply water to the city of Tunis, which was valid for another eighteen years, and grant a new concession to a French company in which the brother of Prime Minister Jules Ferry had an interest. The entire city council of Tunis resigned, and a mass delegation of more than 2,000 notables from the souks and the traditional authorities of the city of Tunis came to at the Dar al-Taj Palace of La Marsa, appealing for the Bey to revise the new municipal law and to repeal the water concession. The old ruler, more popular than his late brother, was overcome with emotion at his inability to act on their petition. &#x27;You have come to weep in the house of tears&#x27; he replied to them. The colonial authorities took punitive action against the leaders of the demonstration without his being able to assist them. Cambon responded to this show of protest by sending leading figures into exile in El Kef and Gabes, and dismissing the top city officials from their posts on the grounds that they were &#x27;fanatics hostile to the Protectorate&#x27;.

Ali Bey met Sheikh Muhammad Abduh, one of the leading jurists and reformers in the Arab world, when he came to Tunis (December 1884-January 1885) to teach at the Zitouna mosque.
Ali Bey withdrew increasingly from the affairs of state before he died. He was buried in the Tourbet el Bey mausoleum in the medina of Tunis and succeeded by his son Muhammad IV al-Hadi.

<doc id="1272241" wikidata="Q75928" url="?curid=1272241" title="Rizal, Laguna">
<text>Rizal, officially the Municipality of Rizal (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 18,332 people.

The municipality, named after the country&#x27;s national hero José Rizal, is one of the youngest municipalities in Laguna.

This town is the birthplace of the milky mixed vegetable dish called &quot;&quot;amenudong gulay&quot;.

The people from this town have an old tradition of celebrating Christmas on January 6. There was also a legend of Michael the Archangel apparitions at the town&#x27;s biggest natural spring &quot;Bukal ni San Miguel&quot;&quot; during the Spanish era, making St. Michael the town&#x27;s patron saint.

The Rizal Re-Recreational Center which is a Christian retreat and recreational camp is also located within this town. The world&#x27;s largest functional top (weighing 990lbs and is 10.5 feet tall) is kept there on display by its proud owner, American missionary and RCC founder Rev. Joe Mauk.

Rizal is also the hometown of Filipina actress-politician Angelica Jones, prolific Filipino comics author Nicky Astronomo, and two consecutive saxophone players of the popular Filipino band South Border, presently Johndave Picache and the late Edward Picache.

==History==
The kaingineros were among the first reported settlers in this part of Laguna around the 17th century. Around mid-1800, this area was called barrio &quot;Pauli&quot; and was part of the town of Nagcarlan.

Residents from this place used to say that the barrio &quot;Pauli&quot; got its name from the way that its brook flows at the edge of the settlement, whose stream flows back and forth. “Pauli,” must have come from the Tagalog word “Pauli-uli,” which means coming back and forth.

Ever since, local villagers earn their living by farming. The soil in this barrio is rich and is abundant of water for there were numerous natural springs around the settlement, making the settlers enjoy bountiful harvests of coconuts, root crops, vegetables, and rice. Locales also thrive by fishing from the Mayton and Mayit brooks and Lawa ng Kalibato (Calibato Lake), which the village share with the town of Sampalok, which is now San Pablo City.

When the Spanish rule ended and the Philippines became a commonwealth state of the United States, Pauli became independent from the town of Nagcarlan and became a new township. The American Federal Government appointed Pedro Urrea the Municipal President. Nevertheless, Pauli&#x27;s township lasted only for a brief two years. Its inability to support its administrative expenses caused Pauli to affiliate once more with its mother town.

However, between 1912 and 1915, residents led by Fortunato Urrea Arban, Agustin Vista, and Felix Isleta, former municipal councilors campaigned to regain their municipal status. The petition included the inclusion of barrios Antipolo, Entablado, Laguan, Pook, Mayton, Pauli, Talaga and Tuy. On December 18, 1918, Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison issued Executive Order No. 56 creating the Municipality of Rizal, naming the town after the foremost national hero and Laguna native Dr. Jose P. Rizal.

Officials inaugurated the new town a year after on January 7, 1919, and had Fortunato Urrea Arban as mayor. Before the citizens of Pauli won back their township, Innocente Sumague donated a piece of land for the construction of a church (Parroquia De San Miguel Arcangel) in 1916. Construction workers quarried Mayton Creek for stones and gravel. The quarry claimed many lives before the construction ended, in time for the midnight mass of Christmas of 1917.

Pablo Urrea became the mayor in 1941 and subsequently relinquished his post to lead the guerrilla fighters during the Japanese occupation.

<text>Christoph Schappeler (1472 – August 25, 1551) was a German religious figure, reformer, and a preacher at St. Martin&#x27;s in Memmingen during the early 16th century and during the Protestant Reformation and the German Peasants&#x27; War. He tended to side with the poor, causing the senate to regulate his sermons in 1516. However, by 1521 the climate had changed such that the senate was giving him support. When he was excommunicated in 1524, the Senate refused to follow the bishop&#x27;s order to have him banished.

It is believed that Schappeler and Sebastian Lotzer wrote &quot;The Twelve Articles: The Just and Fundamental Articles of All the Peasantry and Tenants of Spiritual and Temporal Powers by Whom They Think Themselves Oppressed&quot; in early 1525. Within two months of its initial publication in Memmingen, twenty-five thousand copies of the &quot;Twelve Articles&quot; had spread throughout Europe. The &quot;Twelve Articles&quot; was a religious petition that utilized Luther&#x27;s ideas to appeal for peasants&#x27; rights.

<text>Chatham () is an urban neighbourhood in the city of Miramichi, New Brunswick, Canada.

Prior to municipal amalgamation in 1995, Chatham was an incorporated town in Northumberland County along the south bank of the Miramichi River opposite Douglastown. Since amalgamation, it has been sometimes referred to as Miramichi East. 
==Impact of geography on history==

At Chatham, the Miramichi River is quite wide, the water salty and tidal. Just downstream from the town, the river begins to widen into a broad estuary, where the Miramichi River gradually becomes Miramichi Bay. Because of its eastward facing location, ships coming from the British Isles in early times had easy access through the Strait of Belle Isle and across the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It was more accessible and safer to get to than the ports of Quebec City or Saint John, New Brunswick.

In colonial times, the surrounding lands were heavily forested; the stands of eastern white pine were especially valued for ships&#x27; masts. The river teemed with fish, Atlantic salmon the most prized. Abundant game roamed the forests, and berries were a valuable food supplement.

Scottish immigrants to the area found it familiar. The rocks in the Miramichi are similar to those of Scotland, being a part of the same formation before continental drift separated them. Seabirds and fish are often the same or similar. The Atlantic salmon, the herring gull and the common tern were found in both areas. The Scots had the technology and know-how to cut lumber, fish, farm and build ships. The Irish immigrants did not bring the same skills, as their forests had long been cut down and they did not have such a well-developed fishing industry. They picked up skills from their neighbours. As urban English immigrants did not have these skills, and farmers were used to a more moderate climate, they tended to settle elsewhere.

At Chatham, the river banks are low but not subject to flooding, and are thus well suited as a location for wharves. With a deep channel close to the shore, the largest ships in colonial times could approach the wharves. Away from the shore, the land gradually rises several hundred feet. The soil, while sandy and a bit acid, supports potatoes, root crops and apple trees. All these circumstances made Chatham an ideal location for lumbering and fishing.

==History==

===Early settlement===
In 1765, the troop transport &quot;Pitt&quot; (reputedly named after William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham) was shipwrecked in the Gulf of St Lawrence. Tradition holds that one of the ship&#x27;s boats, named the &quot;Chatham&quot;, washed up near the Miramichi River, giving rise to the town&#x27;s name. 

In 1800 Francis Peabody, a successful businessman, settled in the location that became Chatham, which was then known as &quot;The Spruce&quot;, after a large spruce tree. The Miramichi River is nearly a mile wide here. Its channel comes very close to the shore at this spot, so it was a natural place to build wharves. Logs from the large watershed of the river could easily be floated to this point for milling and export. The best salmon fisheries were nearby.

Other settlers followed, but growth was relatively slow throughout the early part of the 19th century. The first newspaper published in the North Shore of New Brunswick was the &quot;Mercury&quot;, founded in Chatham in 1825. By 1834 the first bank opened. A stage coach left each Monday for Fredericton. The settlement attracted a group of aggressive entrepreneurs, Scottish and English, such as Joseph Cunard, William Muirhead, Jabez Bunting Snowball, and later, W. S. Loggie. Gradually, the community became a centre for lumber mills, shipbuilding, and exporting fish and forest products to the British Isles and, later on, to the United States.
In its early days, Chatham was bustling, energetic, growing and confident. Chatham attracted the Maritime lawyer Richard Bedford Bennett, later to be prime minister of Canada. In 1896 when Chatham held its first elections for Town Council, the young Bennett was elected by one vote. He was then employed with the law firm established by Lemuel Tweedie, a former Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick. Bennett&#x27;s campaign manager was a 17-year-old &quot;articling&quot; student by the name of Max Aitken. Aitken grew up in Newcastle and would later become Lord Beaverbrook. He was appointed the Minister for Aircraft Production in Winston Churchill&#x27;s World War II cabinet.

By 1851, Chatham had 505 employed persons among the following occupations: 170 labourers, 74 servants, 60 shipwrights, 25 joiners, 20 cordwainers, 19 farmers, 16 clerks, 13 blacksmiths, 12 merchants, 10 tailors, 9 storekeepers, 7 sawyers, 7 teachers, 5 blockmakers, 4 sailmakers, 4 riggers, 4 stage drivers, 4 butchers, 4 printers, 3 clergymen, 1 sparmaker, 1 gunsmith, 1 surgeon and 1 constable.

A police force was started in 1858, telephones came to the town in 1880, and street lighting was installed in 1888.

In 1881, somewhat past the prime of sailing ships, the port of Chatham recorded the following annual traffic:
*177 overseas vessels entered- 80,558 tons exported; 11,344 imported:
*302 coastal vessels entered—98,023 tons exported (value $797,179).
In 1881, the value of bank deposits was $133,118.

Chatham was incorporated as a town in 1896. A large wooden hotel, The Adams House operated from 1884 to the 1950s. The four-storey, brick Touraine Hotel was opened in 1908. It was destroyed by fire just after World War II. The hotel was on a branch line of the Canadian National Railways, which brought tourists from Quebec.

===Heyday===

Chatham in its prime (1880–1919) had extensive wharves, a pulp mill, three large sawmills, a fish-packing plant, a large foundry/shipbuilding facility with a repair yard for small vessels, an armoury, several sizeable hotels; a Catholic hospital (Hotel Dieu) and associated nursing home as well as a Nursing School, all run by the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph; three secondary schools, a Catholic liberal arts college, the county poor house (the County Home), a race track, an indoor rink, a golf club, facilities for an agricultural exhibition, and several notable churches. The Anglican Church and Rectory were beautiful wood structures. The church burned down in 1960, but the rectory survived and remained in use until 1974.

The town was a service and shopping centre for the surrounding area, especially the areas farther down the bay. Students boarded at the Catholic girls and boys schools, and the Catholic college in town. During the period, 1880 to 1960, the Catholic Church was a major employer in Chatham, being especially important after the mills began to close.

The New Brunswick Electric Power Commission opened a thermal generation plant in Chatham in 1948. It produced 12,500 kilowatt hours and operated for some years, creating some employment.

Until 1967 a ferry boat provided service across the Miramichi River at Chatham, except during the period of winter freeze up. When the Centennial Bridge was opened, the ferry was no longer needed.

==Catholic religious centre==
The town is dominated by a large Roman Catholic church, St. Michael&#x27;s Basilica. This neogothic structure was formerly a cathedral. Next to it, in the same style, is the former bishop&#x27;s residence, now a convent. From 1860 to 1938 Chatham was the centre of a large Catholic diocese covering the northern part of New Brunswick. The Diocese of Chatham was moved to Bathurst, New Brunswick, in 1938. The Bishop at the time was Bishop Chaisson. The local lore has it that the move took place in the middle of the night so that the local residents would not know.

Following the move of the See from Chatham to Bathurst, the Church was petitioned by local residents to be removed from the Diocese of Bathurst. They wanted to become part of the Diocese of Saint John, New Brunswick. A circle around the Parish of Chatham still designates it as part of the Diocese of Saint John, not Bathurst.

A Catholic religious order, the Religious Hospitaliers of St. Joseph, established the Hotel Dieu and nursing home, as well as the large elementary/secondary school (St. Michael&#x27;s Academy). While the nuns are still present as of 2005, their numbers have been much reduced. The Basilian Fathers operated a small liberal arts college, which was later taken over by the Diocese. It evolved into St. Thomas University, now located in Fredericton. The last convocation ceremony held in Chatham for St. Thomas University was in May 1964.

==Ethnic and religious composition==
Historically, Chatham has been a majority-Catholic town, with smaller United Church, Anglican, and Presbyterian congregations. Various other Protestant denominations have come and gone, though the Pentecostals have been relatively strong. When it was more of a business centre, the town long had several Jewish families; their numbers have declined.

Ethnic backgrounds are Irish, Scottish, English, and French, with the latter gaining somewhat in recent years. Catholic Lebanese immigrants settled here, originally calling themselves Assyrian. Several Norwegian families also immigrated.

==Slow decline==
Chatham achieved peak prosperity during the years immediately prior to World War I, but even then its main export was people. During the war, many young men from Chatham joined the 132nd Battalion of the North Shore Regiment. Many were killed or wounded at Vimy Ridge and on the Somme. The postwar depression of 1919 hit the town, resulting in a major employer, the Snowball sawmill, closing permanently. Young men and women moved to New England to seek work where many had relatives.

World War II saw the opening of RCAF Station Chatham, providing an economic stimulus for the town until its closure in 1996. RCAF Station Chatham was established as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. After the war, many different aircraft were deployed at Chatham. RCAF Station Chatham was the site where the Golden Hawks Aerobatic Team was formed before it was moved. The Golden Hawks were a precursor to the current 431 Air Demonstration Squadron, or &quot;Snowbirds&quot;.

The primary purpose of the base was to train navigators for flight crews serving in the European Theatre. During the 1960s and 1970s, the base, renamed CFB Chatham in 1968, was an important staging ground for CF-101 Voodoo fighter interceptors, which were under command of NORAD to interdict Soviet nuclear bombers that could have challenged Canadian airspace in Atlantic Canada. The Soviet bombers (predominately the &quot;Bear&quot;) flew the circumpolar route from the Soviet Union to Cuba and enjoyed entering Canadian Airspace over Newfoundland to time the reaction of NORAD.

Chatham sent many sons to Europe during World War II as part of the North Shore Regiment. The North Shore Regiment joined the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and the North Nova Scotia Highlanders as the first wave of Canadian Troops to land during the invasion of Normandy. They landed at Juno Beach as part of Operation Overlord. Following the war, the North Shore Regiment was folded into the Royal New Brunswick Regiment (RNBR).

The postwar baby boom of the 1950s enabled the town to reach a peak population of 8,600 in 1961. The loss of St. Thomas University, which moved to Fredericton in 1964 adversely affected the town in combination with other changes. The closure of CFB Chatham in 1996 further reduced local employment. The nursing school run by the Religious Hospitaliers of St. Joseph closed soon after the move of St. Thomas University. The loss of these two educational institutions was both symbolic and contributed to Chatham&#x27;s decline.

Over the years migrants from Chatham have moved to where the jobs were. In the mid to late nineteenth century, some left for lumbering opportunities in the United States in areas such as Maine, Wisconsin and Washington. Until the 1930s, the majority went to Boston as a center of business and industry. Few left during the Hungry Thirties. Right after World War II, Montreal seemed to offer opportunities. It was superseded as an attraction by growth in Toronto and other parts of Ontario.

Fredericton and Moncton were also work destinations from the 1950s onwards, with Halifax becoming more important after 1965. In recent years, Alberta has attracted more Chatham residents.

In 1996, the provincial government amalgamated the incorporated municipalities along the lower Miramichi River valley, creating the city of Miramichi. In 1998, the federal government opened a central processing site for the Canadian Firearms Program (CFP) in Chatham. The office is dedicated to implementing the &quot;Firearms Act&quot;, and will maintain the records of all registered firearms in the country. The office employs several hundred civil servants and has helped to offset employment losses from the base closure. CFP celebrated the 10th anniversary of the opening of Central Processing Site in Miramichi, New Brunswick in 2008.

Today, Chatham is known for its annual Irish Festival. It also has become something of a retirement community, offering good quality, affordable housing. The married quarters of the former military base have been converted to a retirement village, called RMI, or &quot;Retirement Miramichi&quot; they offer low rental rates, and have 276 units. Maintenance is provided as well as lawn care

<text>Sebastian Lotzer (c. 1490 – after 1525) was born in Horb am Neckar. He was a furrier by trade. During his journeyman years, while in Memmingen, he became secretary to the &quot;Baltringer Haufen&quot;, a peasant army during the German Peasants&#x27; War. Lotzer was heavily influenced by theologian Christoph Schappeler.

In 1525, representing the 27 villages of the territory of Memmingen he drew up the Memmingen Articles, and shortly afterwards, in conjunction with the Christian Confederation, the Twelve Articles.

Following the defeat of the peasants by the Swabian League Lotzer had to flee from Memmingen in April 1525. He was last heard of in St. Gallen. His date of death is unknown.

<text>The Bushmaster XM-15 series (or XM15) is a line of AR-15 style semi-automatic rifles and carbines manufactured by Bushmaster Firearms International, LLC. Variants include the Bushmaster M4-type Carbine, Patrolman series, QRC series, Bushmaster XM15-E2S, and the Carbon 15 line.

==Variants==
The standard XM-15 has a forged 7075T6 aircraft-grade aluminum upper and lower receiver. Barrels of XM-15 firearms have a heavy profile and are hard chrome-lined 4150 alloy steel or 416 stainless steel. In Bushmaster&#x27;s 2016 sales brochure, all new-production XM-15s are stated to be supplied with a 4150 steel barrel. The standard barrel has rifling of 1 turn in 9&quot;.
*E2S Series: The basic E2S is fitted with a 16-inch carbine-style barrel.
**E2S Target - 20&quot; heavy-barrel target rifle with A2-style stock and carry handle upper, also available with 24&quot; and 26&quot; barrels.
**E2S Shorty - 16-inch version with a &quot;shorty&quot; handguard.
**E2S Shorty AK - Shorty variant with 14.5-inch carbine SBR barrel with an AK-74-style muzzle brake permanently welded to the end to increase the overall length to 16 inches.
**E2S Dissipator - Variant with a Bushmaster-designed 16-inch &quot;Dissipator&quot; barrel. This mounts a disused gas block with a front sight at the 20&quot; position with the actual used gas block in the carbine position and concealed under a rifle-length 12&quot; handguard allowing more forearm support and room to accessorize the rifle.
*QRC Series: Formerly known as ORC (&quot;optics ready carbine&quot;), but now styled as QRC (&quot;quick response carbine&quot;), are flat-top rifles without iron sights, provided with a simple 1x20 red-dot optic. QRC is chambered in 5.56x45mm with a 1:8 twist melonite coated barrel, M16 style bolt carrier group &amp; mil-spec buffer tube.
*Patrolman Series: - 7&quot; or 10.5&quot; barrel &quot;pistol&quot; version with a free-float handguard and no stock. Also available as a military or LE select-fire version.
*Bushmaster M4-Type Carbine
*Carbon 15

==Notoriety==
The Bushmaster XM15-E2S &quot;M4 type&quot; carbine first gained notoriety for its use in the October 2002 Beltway sniper attacks.

A Bushmaster XM15-E2S carbine was displayed in a February 2011 video message by Caucasus Emirate leader, Dokka Umarov. Bushmaster rifles were captured by pro-Russian forces during the Russo-Georgian War.

A Bushmaster XM-15 was used in the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Just before the second anniversary of the massacre, nine families of the 26 victims of the shooting filed a class action lawsuit in Connecticut against Bushmaster, Remington Arms and others, seeking &quot;unspecified&quot; damages for the defendants&#x27; purported negligent entrustment and illegal marketing of the XM-15 rifle. Plaintiffs argued that both theories of liability fell within exceptions to the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which affords broad civil immunity to gun manufacturers. The case was dismissed in superior court and was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court. 

In March 2019, the Connecticut Supreme Court reinstated the wrongful death lawsuit, holding that the plaintiffs successfully pleaded a cause of action for illegal marketing. Remington appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which denied review on November 12, 2019. On February 15, 2022, Remington Arms insurers settled with families of Sandy Hook victims and agreed to pay a total of $73 million to families.

XM-15 rifles were also used in the 1997 North Hollywood shootout, the 2018 Nashville Waffle House shooting, and the 2022 Buffalo shooting.

An XM15-E2 was captured from Islamic State fighters in Sinjar Mountains by Peshmerga during the Iraqi Civil War.

==Legality==
As of October 2, 2000, California has banned the Bushmaster XM15 by name in the &quot;Kasler v. Lockyer&quot; Assault Weapon List, among other AR-style rifles by Armalite, DPMS, Colt, and Eagle Arms, to name a few.

As a result of the Sandy Hook school shooting: 
* New York State banned the Bushmaster XM-15 series and assault weapons in the January 2013 NY SAFE Act.
* The XM-15 series is among over 100 named firearms added to the Connecticut state assault weapon ban list in an April 2013 amendment, passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting.

<doc id="1272296" wikidata="Q5179749" url="?curid=1272296" title="Cowles Mountain">
<text>Cowles Mountain (/koʊlz/, /kaʊlz/ {a proscribed pronunciation}; properly &quot;KOHLZ&quot;, commonly &quot;KOWLZ&quot;) is a prominent mountain in San Carlos, San Diego, California. The summit is the highest point of the city of San Diego. It is protected within Mission Trails Regional Park.

==History==
The mountain is named after George A. Cowles, a rancher and businessperson in southwestern San Diego County during the 1870s and 1880s.

===San Diego State University===
For many years Cowles Mountain was locally known as &quot;S&quot; Mountain. In 1931, 500 students from San Diego State College, now San Diego State University (SDSU), painted a letter &quot;S&quot; on the side of the mountain, after which it took on its popular name. In April 1942, during World War II, the military ordered the &quot;S&quot; covered up for national security, as it could serve as a potential reference for enemy aerial attacks for strategic sites. After the war, the painting tradition was resurrected.

In the 1970s, the annual repainting tradition was ceased for environmental and habitat protection but had a brief resurgence in the late 1980s. The &quot;S&quot; has not been repainted for nearly three decades.

==Mission Trails Regional Park==
The entire mountain, with marked trails, is a protected area within Mission Trails Regional Park, which opened in 1972.

===Trails===
The main trail to the summit is a popular hiking destination taking hundreds of people per day to a 360-degree panorama of San Diego County. The hike to the top is long and an elevation change of about . This trail is on the corner of Golfcrest Drive and Navajo Road. A much-less-used but maintained trail begins near the intersection of Boulder Lake Avenue and Barker Way. This trail meets the main trail near the summit.

On March 25, 2013, the trails of Cowles were closed for maintenance. The trails were reopened in May 2013 after several improvements to water drainage and rock steps.

== Geology ==
Cowles Mountain consists of Jurassic and early Cretaceous metavolcanic and shallow intrusive igneous rocks that are resistant to erosion, and never covered by later Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary overburden. Small plateaus on the south and east slopes are the remnants of an extensive terrestrial, near sea level erosional surface called the Poway Terrace that are now about in elevation.

A prominent former seacliff on the west side rises above a now-dry wave-cut terrace, now mostly covered with suburban developments, at about in elevation.

<doc id="1272304" wikidata="Q843809" url="?curid=1272304" title="Tirpitz Plan">
<text>Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz&#x27;s design for Germany to achieve world power status through naval power, while at the same time addressing domestic issues, is referred to as the Tirpitz Plan. Politically, the Tirpitz Plan was marked by the Fleet Acts of 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1912. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly 40% smaller than the Royal Navy). It included seventeen modern dreadnoughts, five battlecruisers, twenty-five cruisers and twenty pre-dreadnought battleships as well as over forty submarines. Although including fairly unrealistic targets, the expansion programme was sufficient to alarm the British, starting a costly naval arms race and pushing the British into closer ties with the French. 

Tirpitz developed a &quot;Risk Theory&quot; whereby, if the German Imperial Navy reached a certain level of strength relative to the British Royal Navy, the British would try to avoid confrontation with Germany (that is, maintain a fleet in being). If the two navies fought, the German Navy would inflict enough damage on the British that the latter ran a risk of losing their naval dominance. Because the British relied on their navy to maintain control over the British Empire, Tirpitz felt they would opt to maintain naval supremacy in order to safeguard their empire, and let Germany become a world power, rather than lose the empire as the price of keeping Germany less powerful. This theory sparked a naval arms race between Germany and Great Britain in the first decade of the 20th century.

This theory was based on the assumption that Great Britain would have to send its fleet into the German Bight for a close blockade of the ports (blockading Germany was the only way that the Royal Navy could seriously harm Germany), where the German Navy could force a battle. However, due to Germany&#x27;s geographic location, Great Britain could employ a distant blockade by closing the entrance to the North Sea in the English Channel and the area between Bergen and the Shetland Islands. Faced with this option a German Admiral commented, &quot;If the British do that, the role of our navy will be a sad one,&quot; correctly predicting the role the surface fleet would have during the First World War.

Additionally the plan had domestic political concerns in mind, mainly the preservation of the political status quo and combatting the rise of the Social Democrats. Tirpitz believed that the development of maritime power would advance Germany&#x27;s economic interests and so serve as a &quot;palliative against educated and uneducated Social Democrats&quot;. While Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow, wrote that the plan would &quot;mobilize the best patriotic forces&quot; and &quot;appeal to the highest national emotions&quot; which would in turn &quot;keep the non-Socialist workers away from Social Democracy&quot; and pull the worker away from &quot;the ensnarements of the socialists and accustom him to the monarchical order&quot;.

Politically and strategically, Tirpitz&#x27;s Risk Theory ensured its own failure. By its very nature it forced Britain into measures that would have been previously unacceptable to the British establishment. The necessity to concentrate the fleet against the German threat involved Britain making arrangements with other powers that enabled her to return the bulk of her naval forces to Home Waters. The first evidence of this is seen in the Anglo-Japanese treaty of 1902 that enabled the battleships of the China squadron to be re-allocated back to Europe. The Japanese fleet, largely constructed in British shipyards, then proceeded to utterly destroy the Russian navy in the war of 1904–06, removing Russia as a credible maritime opponent. The necessity to reduce the Mediterranean Fleet in order to reinforce the navy in home waters was also a powerful influence in its détente and Entente Cordiale with the French. By forcing the British to come to terms with its most traditional opponent, Tirpitz scuttled his own policy. Britain was no longer at &#x27;risk&#x27; from France, and the Japanese destruction of the Russian fleet removed that nation as a naval threat. In the space of a few years, Germany was faced with virtually the whole strength of the Royal Navy deployed against its own fleet, and Britain committed to her list of potential enemies. The Tirpitz &#x27;risk theory&#x27; made it more probable that, in any future conflict between the European powers, Britain would be on the side of Germany&#x27;s foes, and that the full force of the most powerful navy in the world would be concentrated against her fleet.

<doc id="1272308" wikidata="Q2490187" url="?curid=1272308" title="Ray Ellington">
<text>Henry Pitts Brown (17 March 1916 – 27 February 1985), known professionally as Ray Ellington, was an English singer, drummer and bandleader. He is best known for his appearances on &quot;The Goon Show&quot; from 1951 to 1960. The Ray Ellington Quartet had a regular musical segment on the show, and Ellington also had a small speaking role in many episodes, often as a parodic African, Native American or Arab chieftain (but also often, with no attempt to change his normal accent, in counter-intuitive roles such as a female secretary or a Scotsman).

==Early life==
Ellington was born Henry Pitts Brown, at 155 Kennington Road, Kennington, London, England, the youngest of four children. His father was Harry Pitts Brown (c.1877–1920), an African American music-hall comedian and entertainer, his mother was Eva Stenkell Rosenthal (b. c.1879), a Russian Jew. His father died when Brown was four years old. Ellington was raised as an Orthodox Jew and attended the South London Jewish School (1924–30), before entering show business at the age of twelve, when he appeared in an acting role on the London stage.

==Life and career==
Ellington&#x27;s first break came in 1937 when he joined Harry Roy and His Orchestra as the band&#x27;s drummer, replacing Joe Daniels. His vocal talents were put to good use too, from the time of his first session when he recorded &quot;Swing for Sale&quot;. Ellington was called up in May 1940 when he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a physical training instructor where he served throughout the war. He played in service bands including RAF Blue Eagles (1945).

After demobilisation, Ellington resumed his career, fronting his own group, playing at The Bag O&#x27;Nails club. Early in 1947, he rejoined the Harry Roy band for a few months. The Ray Ellington Quartet was formed in the same year.

Ellington specialised in jazz but experimented with many other genres and his musical style was heavily influenced by the comedic jump blues of Louis Jordan. Ellington&#x27;s band was one of the first in the UK to feature the stripped-back guitar/bass/drums/piano format that became the basis of rock and roll, as well as being one of the first groups in Britain to prominently feature the electric guitar. They were also reputedly the first jazz band in the UK to use an amplified guitar, which was produced and introduced by their guitar player, Lauderic Caton. The other members of Ellington&#x27;s quartet were Dick Katz (piano) and Coleridge Goode (bass). When guitarist Caton moved on he was succeeded in turn by Laurie Deniz, Australian Don Fraser and Judd Proctor, who was a member of the quartet for six years from July 1955.

Early in &quot;The Goon Show&quot;″s run, there were many jokes linking Ellington to the African nation of Ghana, thus leading Ellington to say that he came from Ghana. Ellington&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Madison&quot; reached No. 36 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1962.

He was married to Anita West, who was to become the second female presenter of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; when she replaced Leila Williams, but left after four months, citing her split with Ellington as the reason. They had had two young children (Lance and Nina) when the marriage ended in divorce. Ray&#x27;s son Lance Ellington is a singer who has recorded several jazz-orientated albums, and is one of the backing singers in the BBC show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. Lance Ellington also appeared in tributes to Peter Sellers, in the film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;, where he played his father, and took his father&#x27;s part in the Goon Show &quot;50th Anniversary Cardboard Replica&quot; first broadcast on 12 April 2001, the day after Harry Secombe died.

Ray Ellington died of cancer on 27 February 1985.

<doc id="1272309" wikidata="Q3209205" url="?curid=1272309" title="St. Michael's Basilica (Miramichi, New Brunswick)">
<text>The Basilica of St. Michael the Archangel is located on a hill overlooking the Miramichi River in the province of New Brunswick, Canada. It is a prominent feature of the former town of Chatham, New Brunswick, and one of the largest churches in Eastern Canada. It is now included within the city of Miramichi, which was formed in 1995.

==Design==

St. Michael&#x27;s Basilica is among the largest churches in Canada, east of Quebec City. The sandstone neo-Gothic structure was designed by Patrick Keely, the same architect of Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago, and the St&#x27;s. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Providence, Rhode Island. St. Michael&#x27;s Basilica is taller than Holy Name in Chicago, somewhat narrower, and about the same length. Holy Name seats about 300 more people (1,520 vs 1,200). Construction of the cathedral started in 1903 and finished in 1921. Italian marble with veined panels was used throughout the interior of the nave and the sacristy. The spire is visible for several miles, especially when approaching Chatham from the north, across the Centennial Bridge that spans the Miramichi River.

==Congregation==

St. Michael&#x27;s Basilica has a historical connection with the Irish Catholics who immigrated to New Brunswick before the Great Famine. As late as the 1980s, large numbers of worshipers attended daily mass during Lent. The church was one way that the new Catholic immigrants of all ethnic origins maintained their unique identity.

When the Irish Catholics came to Canada, unlike their counterparts in the United States, they were barred from public office and the professions. They were required in the early days to tithe to the Church of England. These barriers were lifted during the 19th century, but Irish Catholics remained marginalized and banded together to protect their interests, with St. Michael&#x27;s helping to bring them all together. The parish served by St. Michael&#x27;s had a long history of providing priests for the area and sending others to the foreign missions or to Western Canada. By 1975, however, vocations to the priesthood from Chatham and the area had essentially dried up.

==Features==

The basilica was built as the cathedral of a once-extensive Diocese of Chatham, that covered the northern part of the province. The diocese moved to the French-speaking town of Bathurst, approximately north, in 1938, and Sacred Heart Cathedral became the seat of the new Diocese of Bathurst.

Notable features of the cathedral are the Lady chapel to the west of the main church, a tall single spire (once illuminated by the Canadian Air Force because of the proximity of a fighter base), a green copper roof, and a matching Bishop&#x27;s Palace to the southeast. Its bells, whether tolling a funeral, sounding the Angelus, or ringing in Easter or Christmas, have long been a feature of life in the town. A fine stand of linden trees, planted by Bishop James Rogers, stands to the east of the basilica, in front of the palace.

==Designation==
The church is unique in that it was the cathedral of the Diocese of Chatham, but lost that distinction when the see moved in 1938. The church was then designated a proto-cathedral until 1989, when Pope John Paul II elevated it to a minor basilica.

<text>A through line is a connecting theme or plot used in media such as films and books. It is sometimes also called the &#x27;spine&#x27;, and was first suggested by Konstantin Stanislavski as a simplified way for actors to think about characterization. He believed actors should not only understand what their character was doing, or trying to do (their objective), in any given unit, but should also strive to understand the through line that linked these objectives together and thus pushed the character forward through the narrative.

Through line is increasingly being used in other contexts as substitutes for words like &quot;thread&quot;, as seen in the following excerpt from an article by Alex Knapp: &quot;There is a constant through line we see starting with &quot;A New Hope&quot; and running through to the end of the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; of the Emperor consolidating more and more power into his own hands and that of his right-hand man, Darth Vader.&quot;

<doc id="1272322" wikidata="Q1328812" url="?curid=1272322" title="Algiz">
<text>Algiz (also Elhaz) is the name conventionally given to the &quot;&quot;z&quot;-rune&quot; of the Elder Futhark runic alphabet. Its transliteration is &quot;z&quot;, understood as a phoneme of the Proto-Germanic language, the terminal &quot;*z&quot; continuing Proto-Indo-European terminal &quot;*s&quot; via Verner&#x27;s law.

It is one of two runes which express a phoneme that does not occur word-initially, and thus could not be named acrophonically, the other being the &quot;ŋ&quot;-rune Ingwaz . As the terminal &quot;*-z&quot; phoneme marks the nominative singular suffix of masculine nouns, the rune occurs comparatively frequently in early epigraphy.

Because this specific phoneme was lost at an early time, the Elder Futhark rune underwent changes in the medieval runic alphabets. In the Anglo-Saxon futhorc it retained its shape, but became otiose as it ceased to represent any sound in an Old English. However, possibly due to runic manuscript tradition, it was occasionally used to transliterate the Latin letter &quot;X&quot; into the runic script.

In Proto-Norse and Old Norse, the Germanic &quot;*z&quot; phoneme developed into an R sound, perhaps realized as a retroflex approximant , which is usually transcribed as &quot;ʀ&quot;. This sound was written in the Younger Futhark using the Yr rune , the Algiz rune turned upside down, from about the 7th century. This phoneme eventually became indistinguishable from the regular &quot;r&quot; sound in the later stages of Old Norse, at about the 11th or 12th century.

The shape of the rune may be derived from that of a letter expressing /x/ in certain Old Italic alphabets (), which was in turn derived from the Greek letter Ψ which had the value of /kʰ/ (rather than /ps/) in the Western Greek alphabet. Alternatively, the rune may have been an original innovation, or it may have been adapted from the classical Latin alphabet&#x27;s &quot;Y&quot;, or from the Rhaetic alphabet&#x27;s &quot;Z&quot;.

== Name ==
The Elder Futhark rune is conventionally called &quot;Algiz&quot; or &quot;Elhaz&quot;, from the Common Germanic word for &quot;elk&quot;.

There is wide agreement that this is most likely not the historical name of the rune, but in the absence of any positive evidence of what the historical name may have been, the conventional name is simply based on a reading of the rune name in the Anglo-Saxon rune poem, first suggested by Wilhelm Grimm (&quot;Über deutsche Runen&quot;, 1821), as &quot;eolh&quot; or &quot;eolug&quot; &quot;elk&quot;.

Like the &quot;ng&quot;-rune, the &quot;z&quot;-rune is a special case inasmuch as it could not have been named acrophonically, since the sound it represents did not occur in word-initial position. Choosing a name that terminates in &quot;-z&quot; would have been more or less arbitrary, as this was the nominative singular suffix of almost every masculine noun of the language. Since the name &quot;eolh&quot;, or more accurately &quot;eolh-secg&quot; &quot;elk-sedge&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon rune poem represents not the rune&#x27;s original sound value, but rather the sound of Latin &quot;x&quot; (/ks/), it becomes highly arbitrary to suggest that the original rune should have been named after the elk.

There are a number of speculative suggestions surrounding the history of the rune&#x27;s name. The difficulty lies in the circumstance that the Younger Futhark rune did not inherit this name at all, but acquired the name of the obsolete Eihwaz rune, as &quot;yr&quot;. The only independent evidence of the Elder Futhark rune&#x27;s name would be the name of the corresponding Gothic letter, &quot;ezec&quot;. The Gothic letter was an adoption of Greek Zeta, and while it did express the /z/ phoneme, this Gothic sound only rarely occurred terminally. Instead, it is found mostly in positions where West and North Germanic have &quot;r&quot;, e.g. Gothic &quot;máiza&quot; &quot;greater&quot; (Old Norse &quot;meira&quot;, English &quot;more&quot;).

The name of the Anglo-Saxon rune is variously recorded as &quot;eolx, eolhx, ilcs, ilx, iolx, ilix, elux&quot;.

Manuscript tradition gives its sound value as Latin &quot;x&quot;, i.e. /ks/, or alternatively as &quot;il&quot;, or yet again as &quot;&quot;l&quot; and &quot;x&quot;&quot;. The reading of this opaque name as &quot;eolh&quot; &quot;elk&quot; is entirely due to the reading of the Anglo-Saxon rune poem&#x27;s secg as &quot;eolh-secg&quot; (&quot;eolx-secg&quot;, &quot;eolug-secg&quot;, &quot;eolxecg&quot;) &quot;elk-sedge&quot;, apparently the name of a species of sedge (&quot;Carex&quot;). This reading of the poem is due to Wilhelm Grimm (1821), and remains standard. The suggestion is that this compound is realized as &quot;eolk-secg&quot;, thus containing the Latin &quot;x&quot; (/ks/) sound sequence. The manuscript testimony that the rune is to be read as &quot;il&quot; would then be simply a mistaken assumption that its name must be acrophonic.

The name of the corresponding Gothic letter &quot;ezec&quot;, however, suggests that the old name of this rune was not just &quot;eolx&quot;, but the full &quot;eolh-secg&quot;. This is puzzling, because the sound value of the rune was clearly not /ks/ in the Elder Futhark period (2nd to 4th centuries). Furthermore, the name of the sedge in question is recorded in the older Epinal-Erfurt glossary as &quot;ilugsegg&quot; (glossing &quot;papiluus&quot;, probably for &quot;papyrus&quot;), which cannot be derived from the word for elk.

A suggestion by Warren and Elliott takes the Old English &quot;eolh&quot; at face value, and reconstructs a Common Germanic form of either &quot;*algiz&quot; or &quot;*alhiz&quot;. They cite a &quot;more fanciful school&quot; which assumes an original meaning of &quot;elk&quot; based on a theonym &quot;Alcis&quot; recorded by Tacitus (suggesting that the name would have been theophoric in origin, referring to an &quot;elk-god&quot;). The authors dismiss the Old English &quot;elk-sedge&quot; as a late attempt to give the then-obsolete rune a value of Latin &quot;x&quot;. Instead, they suggest that the original name of the rune could have been Common Germanic &quot;*algiz&quot; (&#x27;Algie&#x27;), meaning not &quot;elk&quot; but &quot;protection, defence&quot;.

Redbond (1936) suggested that the &quot;eolhx&quot; (etc.) may have been a corruption of &quot;helix&quot;. Seebold (1991) took this up to suggest that the name of the rune may be connected to the use of &quot;elux&quot; for &quot;helix&quot; by Notker to describe the constellation of Ursa Major (as turning around the celestial pole).

An earlier suggestion is that of Zacher (1855), to the effect that the earliest value of this rune was the labiovelar /hw/, and that its name may have been &quot;hweol&quot; &quot;wheel&quot;.

== – Elder Futhark ==

In the Elder Futhark, Algiz represents the Germanic phoneme &quot;*z&quot;, which does not occur word-initially.

It is attested in final position in the earliest inscriptions, e.g. in &quot;ansuz&quot; (Vimose buckle), &quot;þewaz&quot; (Thorsberg chape). It was presumably present in the Ovre Stabu spearhead inscription (ca. AD 180), reading &quot;raunija[z]&quot;, but is hardly legible now. The Nydam axe-handle (4th century) has the name &quot;wagagastiz&quot;. The Golden Horns of Gallehus (early 5th century) had the personal name &quot;hlewagastiz holtijaz&quot;.

In the earliest inscriptions, the rune invariably has its standard Ψ-shape. From the 5th century or so, the rune appears optionally in its upside-down variant which would become the standard Younger Futhark &quot;yr&quot; shape. There are also other graphical variants; for example, the Charnay Fibula has a superposition of these two variants, resulting in an &quot;asterisk&quot; shape ().

== – Anglo-Saxon futhorc ==

The name of the Anglo-Saxon rune is variously recorded as &quot;eolx, ilcs, ilix, elux, eolhx&quot;. Manuscript tradition gives its sound value as Latin &quot;x&quot;, i.e. /ks/, or alternatively as &quot;il&quot;, or yet again as &quot;&quot;l&quot; and &quot;x&quot;&quot;. The relevant stanza of the Anglo-Saxon rune poem reads:
: [g e]
:
Reading the rune as &quot;eolhx&quot; (as discussed above), and with the emendation of &quot;seccard&quot; to &quot;secg eard&quot; due to Grimm (1821), the stanza becomes about a species of sedge (&quot;Cladium mariscus&quot;) called &quot;elk-sedge&quot;. In the translation of Page (1999):
:The Elk-sedge usually lives in the fen,
:growing in the water. It wounds severely,
:staining with blood any man
:who makes a grab at it.

The 9th-century &quot;abecedarium anguliscum&quot; in Codex Sangallensis 878 shows &quot;eolh&quot; as a peculiar shape, as it were a bindrune of the older with the Younger Futhark , resulting in an &quot;asterisk&quot; shape similar to &quot;ior&quot; .

The only known instance where the rune does take the sound value of Latin &quot;x&quot; in epigraphy is the spelling of &quot;rex&quot; &quot;king&quot; on the interlace coin dies of king Beonna (mid 8th century). Furthermore, it appears in the inscription on St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin (late 7th century) in the abbreviation of the name Christ, where Greek ΧΡΣ is taken as Latin &quot;xps&quot; and rendered as runic ᛉᛈᛋ.

== – Younger Futhark ==
In the 6th and 7th centuries, the Elder Futhark began to be replaced by the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia. By the 8th century, the Elder Futhark was extinct, and Scandinavian runic inscriptions were exclusively written in Younger Futhark.

The Yr rune is a rune of the Younger Futhark. Its common transliteration is a small capital &quot;ʀ&quot;. The shape of the &quot;Yr&quot; rune in the Younger Futhark is the inverted shape of the Elder Futhark rune (). Its name &quot;yr&quot; (&quot;yew&quot;) is taken from the name of the Elder Futhark Eihwaz rune.

Its phonological value is the continuation of the phoneme represented by Algiz, the word-final &quot;*-z&quot; in Proto Germanic. In Proto-Norse it is pronounced closer to , perhaps . Within later Old Norse, the Proto-Norse phoneme collapses with by the 12th century.

Unicode has (IPA’s symbol for the uvular trill). A corresponding capital letter is at . The rune itself is encoded at . Its variants are () and ().

== Derivatives ==
=== – Younger Futhark ===

Independently, the shape of the Elder Futhark Algiz rune reappears in the Younger Futhark &quot;Maðr&quot; rune , continuing the Elder Futhark rune &quot;*Mannaz&quot;.

=== – Anglo-Saxon ===

The Anglo-Saxon k-rune ᛣ (&quot;Calc&quot;) has the same shape as Younger Futhark &quot;yr&quot;, but is unrelated in origin, being a modification or &quot;doubling&quot; of the c-rune (&quot;Cēn&quot;).

== Modern usage ==
=== &quot;Life rune&quot; and &quot;death rune&quot; ===

19th Century German occultist Guido von List introduced the use of the Armanen Futharkh, which were based on the Elder &amp; Younger Futhark. In List&#x27;s context, the &quot;Man&quot; rune (identical in shape to the Elder Futhark &quot;Algiz&quot;) came to be understood in the Germanic mysticism of the early 20th century as symbolizing &quot;life&quot; and called the &quot;life rune&quot; (). This term occurs as early as the 1920s in the literature of Ariosophy.

The &quot;Yr&quot; rune from the Younger Futhark came to be seen as the &quot;life rune&quot; inverted, and so interpreted as &quot;death rune&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

=== Nazism ===


Guido von List&#x27;s beliefs incorporated antisemitism and volkism, and his runic system was later adopted and modified by Karl Maria Wiligut who was responsible for their adoptions in Nazi occultism. Algiz came to be widely used within the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany, e.g. in official prescriptions for the various uniforms of the &quot;&quot;.

During the World War II era, the &quot;life-rune&quot; and &quot;death rune&quot; came to be used in obituaries and on tomb stones as marking birth and death dates ( for &quot;born&quot;, for &quot;died&quot;), replacing asterisk and cross symbols (* for &quot;born&quot;, † for &quot;died&quot;) conventionally used in this context in Germany. It has always been clear that this association is an innovation of modern esotericism, without direct precedent in the medieval usage of the Younger Futhark alphabet. This fact was pointed out in an article in the German journal &quot;Stimmen der Zeit&quot; as early as in 1940.

=== Pop culture ===

The neo-folk group Death in June used the Algiz in their cover of their double LP &quot;The Wörld Thät Sümmer,&quot; alongside their &quot;Totenkopf 6&quot; logo.

The term &quot;death rune&quot; has been used in the context of esotericist or occultist aesthetics associated with black metal, in the name of &quot;Deathrune Records&quot; (as of 2011), formerly &quot; Records&quot;, a minor black metal record label.

=== Contemporary Neopaganism ===

As with other Futhark runes, Algiz is commonly used as a symbol of neopagan faith.

Following Ralph Blum (1982), the Algiz rune is given a sense of &quot;protection&quot; in some modern systems of runic divination.
Blum (1982) himself glosses for &quot;Algiz&quot; with &quot;Protection; Sedge or Rushes; An Elk&quot;.

===Contemporary Fascism===

Due to its use in Nazi Germany, Algiz is also used as a present-day fascist symbol, including use in white supremacism and ecofascism. Contemporary examples include use by the American National Alliance (as of 2007), and in reference to the Algiz rune in the logo of the Flemish nationalist as &quot;levensrune&quot; (as of 2016).

Since Algiz is also commonly used by non-racist groups and individuals, the rune does not automatically indicate the presence of fascism or racism: its meaning depends on the context where it is used.

<text>Antonio Allegra (1905 – 1969) was an Italian organist and lyricist. As one of the organists of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica at his time, he wrote the words to &quot;Inno e Marcia Pontificale&quot;, which was adopted in 1949 as the national anthem of the Holy See (Vatican City). The music was by Charles Gounod.

<doc id="1272337" wikidata="Q2724817" url="?curid=1272337" title="Pity">
<text>Pity is a sympathetic sorrow evoked by the suffering of others. The word is comparable to &quot;compassion&quot;, &quot;condolence&quot;, or &quot;empathy&quot;. It derives from the Latin (etymon also of &quot;piety&quot;). Self-pity is pity directed towards oneself.

Two different kinds of pity can be distinguished, &quot;benevolent pity&quot; and &quot;contemptuous pity&quot;. In the latter, through insincere, pejorative usage, pity connotes feelings of superiority, condescension, or contempt.

==Psychological opinions==
Psychologists see pity arising in early childhood out of the infant&#x27;s ability to identify with others.

Psychoanalysis sees a more convoluted route to (at least some forms of) adult pity by way of the sublimation of aggression—pity serving as a kind of magic gesture intended to show how leniently one should oneself be treated by one&#x27;s own conscience.

==Religious views==
In the West, the religious concept of pity was reinforced after acceptance of Judeo-Christian concepts of God pitying all humanity, as found initially in the Jewish tradition: &quot;Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him&quot; (). The Hebrew word translated in the Septuagint as carries the meaning roughly equivalent to pity in the sense of compassion, mercy, and loving-kindness.

In Mahayana Buddhism, Bodhisattvas are described by the Lotus Sutra as those who &quot;hope to win final Nirvana for all beings—for the sake of the many, for their weal and happiness, out of pity for the world&quot;.

==Philosophical assessments==
Aristotle in his &quot;Rhetoric&quot; argued that before a person can feel pity for another human, the person must first have experienced suffering of a similar type, and the person must also be somewhat distanced or removed from the sufferer. He defines pity as follows: &quot;Let pity, then, be a kind of pain in the case of an apparent destructive or painful harm of one not deserving to encounter it, which one might expect oneself, or one of one&#x27;s own, to suffer, and this when it seems near&quot;. Aristotle also pointed out that &quot;people pity their acquaintances, provided that they are not exceedingly close in kinship; for concerning these they are disposed as they are concerning themselves&quot;, arguing further that in order to feel pity, a person must believe that the person who is suffering does not deserve their fate. Developing a traditional Greek view in his work on poetry, Aristotle also defines tragedy as a kind of imitative poetry that provokes pity and fear.

David Hume in his &quot;Treatise of Human Nature&quot; argued that &quot;pity is concern for... the misery of others without any friendship... to occasion this concern.&quot; He continues that pity &quot;is derived from the imagination.&quot; When one observes a person in misfortune, the observer initially imagines his sorrow, even though they may not feel the same. While &quot;we blush for the conduct of those, who behave themselves foolishly before us; and that though they show no sense of shame, nor seem in the least conscious of their folly,&quot; Hume argues &quot;that he is the more worthy of compassion the less sensible he is of his miserable condition.&quot;

Jean-Jacques Rousseau had the following opinion of pity as opposed to love for others: 

Nietzsche pointed out that since all people to some degree value self-esteem and self-worth, pity can negatively affect any situation. Nietzsche considered his own sensitivity to pity a lifelong weakness; and condemned what he called &quot;Schopenhauer&#x27;s morality of pity... pity negates life&quot;.

== Medieval conceptions ==
Geoffrey Chaucer wrote &quot;&quot; at least ten times in his works, across the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; and the &quot;Legend of Good Women&quot;.
The word &quot; had entered Middle English from Latin &quot; in seven spellings: &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot;.
Early Middle English writers did not yet have words such as &quot;sympathy&quot; and &quot;empathy&quot;; and even the word &quot;compassion&quot; is not attested in English until the 14th century.
The Mediaeval writer&#x27;s notion of &quot;&quot; was thus somewhat different to the divided ideas of pity and piety in Modern English, which has also since gained connotations of disengagement (the pitier as an observer to and separate from the pitied) and condescension from a superior position.

The many senses of the compound notion are exemplified by how Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Enchiridion&quot; was translated in the 16th century.
In the original Latin, talking about the ways of the spirit versus the ways of the flesh, Erasmus says &quot;.
In translation, the single words in Latin became several phrases in English to encompass the entire range of the original concept, which was by that time bifurcating as the words were bifurcating: &quot;

Chaucer&#x27;s line, described by Walter Skeat as being Chaucer&#x27;s favourite, was understood by Edgar Finley Shannon to be a translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Tristia&quot; volume 3, verses 31–32, Shannon describing it as &quot;an admirable translation and adaptation of the passage&quot;.
A noble mind (&quot; in Ovid, &quot; in Chaucer) is easily moved (&quot; in Ovid, &quot; in Chaucer) to kindness (&quot; in Ovid &quot; in Chaucer).
In the &quot;Legend&quot;, Chaucer describes women in general as &quot;.

It wasn&#x27;t until the 16th century that there was a fully-fledged split between pity and piety.
In the 14th century, John Gower was, in contrast, using &quot; in his &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; to encompass both concepts, as his Latin glosses to the text reveal, stating that &quot;.
Cognates of the word include the Provençal &quot; and the Spanish &quot;.
Like Middle English, Old French took the word from the Latin and gradually split it into &quot; (later &quot;) and &quot;.
Italian in contrast retained the one word: &quot;, borrowed into English (through French, in the 19th century replacing its older &quot;) as a technical concept in the arts: pietà.

==Literary examples==
*Juvenal considered pity the noblest aspect of human nature.
*Mystic poet William Blake was ambivalent about pity, initially casting it in a negative role, before viewing pity as an emotion that can draw beings together. In The Book of Urizen pity begins when Los looks on the body of Urizen bound in chains. However, Pity furthers the fall, &quot;For pity divides the soul&quot;, dividing Los and Enitharmon (Enitharmon is named Pity at her birth). Blake maintained that Pity disarmed righteous indignation leading to action; and, railing further against Pity in &quot;The Human Abstract&quot;, Blake exclaims: &quot;Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor&quot; (1–2).
*J. R. R. Tolkien made pity—that of the hobbits for Gollum—pivotal to the action of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: &quot;It was Pity that stayed his hand... the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many&quot;.
*Wilfred Owen prefaced his collection of war poetry with the claim that &quot;My subject is War and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity&quot;—something C. H. Sisson considered to verge on sentimentality.

<text>The 1956 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1956 season. The 53rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion and defending World Series champion Brooklyn Dodgers. A rematch of the series, it was also the final Subway Series in the Fall Classic until 44 years later in , as the Dodgers and the New York Giants moved to California following the 1957 season. Additionally, it was the last time a New York City team represented the National League in a World Series until 1969, when the New York Mets defeated the Baltimore Orioles in five games.

The Yankees won the series in seven games, capturing their 17th championship. Brooklyn won Games 1 and 2, but New York pitchers threw five consecutive complete games (Games 3–7) to cap off the comeback. The highlight was Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in Game 5, during which he struck out seven batters. Despite his shaky start in Game 2, in which he allowed four unearned runs off one hit, Larsen was named the Series MVP for his perfect game. The Dodgers scored 19 runs in the first two games, but only six in the remaining five games, with just one in the final three games.

This was the last World Series to date not to have scheduled off days (although Game 2 was postponed a day due to rain).

As of March 2020, four original television broadcasts from this series (Game 2 partial, Games 3 and 5 complete, Game 7 partial) had been released on DVD.

==Summary==

: postponed from October 4 due to rain

==Matchups==

===Game 1===

Three batters into the game, the Yankees led 2–0 on a Mickey Mantle home run. Brooklyn struck back with a Jackie Robinson homer in the second inning and a three-run Gil Hodges shot in the third, then won behind Sal Maglie&#x27;s complete game.

===Game 2===


Neither starting pitcher survived the second inning, Don Newcombe giving up a Yogi Berra grand slam, and Don Larsen giving up four unearned runs. Little-known pitcher Don Bessent worked the final seven innings for the win.

Game 2 set a number of peculiar records in World Series history, which are either matched or comparable with similar World Series records and performances, in limited instances:

*Game 2 is the first of three World Series games in history in which a grand slam-hitting team failed to win the game. The 1988 Oakland Athletics would produce a grand slam in Game 1, lose that game, and furthermore lose that series. The 2021 Atlanta Braves benefited from a first-inning grand slam in Game 5 but lost the game; the Braves recovered to clinch the series in six games.
*The number of Yankee runs put up in the game, eight, is the largest number of runs accumulated in a World Series game, by a team which lost the game, yet went on to win the series. This record is shared in common only with Game 3 of 1947, also a Yankee/Dodgers series.
*The combined run count of both teams in the game (21) was the most since Game 2 of the 1936 Series, in which the Yankees and Giants combined for 22. Both were not eclipsed until Game 4 of the 1993 Series.

===Game 3===


Whitey Ford pitched a complete game, scattering eight hits, and got the support he needed from an Enos Slaughter three-run homer in the sixth that gave the Yankees a 4–2 lead; they never trailed in the game afterwards.

===Game 4===

Hank Bauer&#x27;s two-run homer in the seventh off Don Drysdale, pitching in relief, put the game away for the Yankees, who got a complete-game six-hitter from Tom Sturdivant. Mantle hit a home run off Ed Roebuck in the previous inning.

===Game 5===


In Game 5, Don Larsen, displaying an unusual &quot;no-windup&quot; style and &quot;working the curveball beautifully&quot;, pitched the only postseason perfect game, and the only World Series no-hitter until 2022. While striking out seven Dodgers, Larsen had only one at-bat reach a three-ball count (against Pee Wee Reese, in the first inning).

Of several close moments, the best remembered is Gil Hodges&#x27; fifth-inning line drive toward Yankee Stadium&#x27;s famed &quot;Death Valley&quot; in left-center, snared by center fielder Mickey Mantle with a spectacular running catch. In addition to that, Yankees fielders had to record three more lineouts, and shortstop Gil McDougald had to make a play on a ball that caromed off third baseman Andy Carey’s glove.

Brooklyn&#x27;s Sal Maglie gave up only two runs on five hits and was perfect himself until a fourth-inning home run by Mantle broke the scoreless tie. The Yankees added an insurance run in the sixth as Hank Bauer&#x27;s single scored Carey, who had opened the inning with a single and was sacrificed to second by Larsen.

The final out of the game came on a called third strike against Dale Mitchell and generated one of the most iconic images in sports history, when catcher Yogi Berra leaped into Larsen&#x27;s arms.

When a reporter asked Yankees manager Casey Stengel afterward if this was the best game Larsen had ever pitched, Stengel diplomatically answered, &quot;So far!&quot; For Larsen, it was an especially satisfying performance, as he had acquired perhaps a better reputation as a night owl than as a pitcher. Stengel once said of Larsen, &quot;The only thing he fears is sleep!&quot; Larsen&#x27;s perfect game was also the last game that umpire Babe Pinelli called behind the plate.

Sports cartoonist Willard Mullin drew an illustration of a happy Larsen painting a canvas titled &quot;The Master Piece&quot;, observed by a group of fawning art critics and Mullin&#x27;s classic &quot;Brooklyn Bum&quot;. Referencing the old saw &quot;I don&#x27;t know much about art, but I know what I like&quot;, the disgusted-looking Bum came up with a variation: &quot;It may be art...but I don&#x27;t like it!&quot;

Brooklyn starter Sal Maglie appeared on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; the night before the game, with former Yankee Phil Rizzuto as one of the panel members.

===Game 6===


In a 10-inning scoreless pitching duel with both starters going all the way, Jackie Robinson&#x27;s walk-off single to left in the bottom of the 10th won the game for Clem Labine and kept the Dodgers&#x27; championship hopes alive. Tough-luck loser Bob Turley gave up a 10th-inning walk to Jim Gilliam, a sacrifice bunt by Pee Wee Reese and intentional pass to Duke Snider before the decisive hit. Game 6 is one of only three games in World Series history to be scoreless through nine innings, the others being Game 2 in 1913 and Game 7 in 1991.

===Game 7===


Yogi Berra&#x27;s two homers led New York to an unexpectedly easy 9–0 title-clinching victory. Yankee pitcher Johnny Kucks struck out Jackie Robinson to end the Series. It would be Robinson&#x27;s final at-bat, as he retired at the season&#x27;s end.

After belting the Yankee pitching staff for 19 runs and 21 hits in the first two games, the Dodger bats went silent in the next five games, scoring only six runs on 21 hits, batting only .142 (21–for–148). New York outscored Brooklyn 22–6 in Games 3–7, the Yankees winning their 17th World Series.

==Composite line score==
1956 World Series (4–3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.)
==Broadcasting==
NBC televised the Series, with announcers Mel Allen (for the Yankees) and Vin Scully (for the Dodgers). In 2006, it was announced that a nearly-complete kinescope recording of the Game 5 telecast (featuring Larsen&#x27;s perfect game) had been discovered by a collector. That kinescope recording aired during the MLB Network&#x27;s inaugural night on the air on January 1, 2009, supplemented with interviews of both Larsen and Yogi Berra by Bob Costas. The first inning of the telecast is still considered lost and was not aired by the MLB Network or included in a subsequent DVD release of the game.

The Mutual network aired the Series on radio, with Bob Wolff and Bob Neal announcing. This was the final World Series broadcast for Mutual, which had covered the event since 1935; NBC&#x27;s radio network would gain exclusive national rights to baseball the following season.

<doc id="1272341" wikidata="Q3444565" url="?curid=1272341" title="Jovo Stanisavljević Čaruga">
<text>Jovan &quot;Jovo&quot; Stanisavljević (; 1897–27 February 1925), known by his nickname Čaruga (Чаруга), was a Serbian outlaw (&quot;hajduk&quot;) in Slavonia in the early 20th century.

==Early life==
Stanisavljević was born in 1897, into a Serb Orthodox family in the village of Slavonske Bare (part of Zdenci) in the Virovitica County, autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austro-Hungary. He was named after his paternal grandfather Jovan, who went by the family nickname of &quot;Čaruga&quot; (&quot;troublemaker&quot;). His father Prokopija was a peasant, and his mother Ika died when he was ten. His father remarried, and he had a tough upbringing, later running away from home to Osijek, where he went to a locksmith school.

==Criminal career==
When World War I broke out, he stopped his studies and enrolled in the Austro-Hungarian Army. However, he posed as an officer and deserted the front lines. Shortly afterwards, he killed a man who was courting his girlfriend, and after a local nobleman threatened to arrest him, he killed him too. He was eventually apprehended, tried, and convicted, and started serving his sentence in the Sremska Mitrovica penitentiary. He managed to escape from prison and had a warrant for his capture, returning home where he was unwelcome. Čaruga left for the woods, where he befriended a gang, &quot;Kolo gorskih tića&quot; (&quot;Band of Mountain Birds&quot;), composed mostly of deserters, who all detested the rich Slavonian peasants and robbed them mercilessly, and were not afraid of killing people. He used the false names Nikola Drezgić and Mile Barić. The war was long over, but Čaruga and the gang were still pillaging the countryside, and became hunted by the Yugoslav gendarmerie. Eventually in 1922 he decided to leave for Zagreb, where he posed as a rich gentleman from Vinkovci and also continued his life of thievery. He would later return to Slavonia to continue stealing together with his group members. On 14 October 1923, however, they attempted to rob the Eltz family estate in Ivankovo near Vinkovci. They killed a man on site, while another snuck out and called the gendarmerie. After the skirmish that ensued they managed to escape but without their loot. More importantly, the police got on their trail and soon captured them. By February 1925, Čaruga&#x27;s trial at the court in Osijek was finished, and he was subsequently hanged in front of a crowd of 3,000.

Čaruga&#x27;s demise attracted a lot of popular attention at the time, and numerous popular books. In 1991 the movie &quot;Čaruga&quot; was directed by Rajko Grlić. He remains a well-known historic figure in the Balkans.

<text>The Bishop&#x27;s Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 

White attacks Black&#x27;s f7-square and prevents Black from advancing the d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner&#x27;s maxim &quot;develop knights before bishops&quot;, White leaves their f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2–f4.

The f2–f4 gives the Bishop&#x27;s Opening an affinity with the King&#x27;s Gambit and the Vienna Game, two openings that share this characteristic. The Bishop&#x27;s Opening can transpose into either of these openings, and in particular a favorable variation of the King&#x27;s Gambit, but with care Black can circumvent this. Transpositions into the Giuoco Piano and the Two Knights Defense and other openings are also possible.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; assigns the Bishop&#x27;s Opening the codes C23 and C24.
==History and use==
The Bishop&#x27;s Opening is one of the oldest openings to be analyzed; it was studied by Lucena and Ruy Lopez. Later it was played by Philidor. Larsen was one of the few grandmasters to play it often, after first using it at the 1964 Interzonal tournament. Although the Bishop&#x27;s Opening is uncommon today, it has been used occasionally as a surprise by players such as Kasparov. Nunn uses it to avoid Petrov&#x27;s Defence (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6), and Lékó played it in the 2007 World Championship against Kramnik, known to consistently play the Petrov.

Weaver Adams in his classic work &quot;White to Play and Win&quot; claimed that the Bishop&#x27;s Opening was a win for White by from the second move. He was unable to prove this by defeating players stronger than himself, however, and later abandoned the Bishop&#x27;s Opening for the Vienna Game, making the same claim. Grandmaster Nick de Firmian, in the 14th edition of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot;, concludes that the Bishop&#x27;s Opening leads to with best play by both sides, and notes that, &quot;Among modern players only Bent Larsen has played it much, but even Kasparov gave it a whirl (winning against Bareev).&quot;

==Main variations==
Because White&#x27;s second move makes no direct threat, Black has many possible second-move responses. As shown below, the Bishop&#x27;s Opening offers opportunities to transpose to several other Open Games.

===Berlin Defense: 2...Nf6 ===
Probably Black&#x27;s most popular second move is 2...Nf6, forcing White to decide how to defend the e-pawn.
 


After 3.d3 Black must be careful not to drift into an inferior variation of the King&#x27;s Gambit Declined. One continuation that avoids this pitfall is 3...c6 4.Nf3 d5 5.Bb3 Bd6.

White sometimes chooses the Bishop&#x27;s Opening move order to transpose into the Giuoco Piano while preventing Black from playing Petrov&#x27;s Defense. For example, 2...Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nf3 Bc5 reaches the quiet Giuoco Pianissimo.

The Urusov Gambit is named after Russian Prince Sergey Semyonovich Urusov (1827–1897). After 2...Nf6 3.d4 exd4 (3...Nxe4 4.dxe5 gives White some advantage) 4.Nf3, Black can transpose to the Two Knights Defense with 4...Nc6, or can decline the gambit with 4...d5 5.exd5 Bb4+ 6.c3 (6.Kf1 is recommended by Michael Goeller, winning a pawn at the expense of castling rights) 6...Qe7+ 7.Be2 dxc3, when 8.bxc3 and 8.Nxc3 both offer approximately equal chances. Instead, Black can accept the gambit with 4...Nxe4 5.Qxd4 Nf6 (5...Nd6 6.0-0 gives White an overwhelming attack), and White will continue with Nc3, Bg5, Qh4, 0-0-0, and usually intends to meet ...0-0 and ...h6 with the piece sacrifice Bxh6, exposing the black king. Black has a solid position with no clear weaknesses, but White has attacking chances and piece activity as compensation for the pawn. The Urusov Gambit is also occasionally reached via the Petrov Defence after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4.

The Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit is named after English players and chess writers Samuel Boden and Lionel Kieseritzky. Boden published the first analysis of it in 1851. Opening theoreticians consider that after 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxe4 4.Nc3 Nxc3 5.dxc3 f6, White&#x27;s attack is not quite worth a pawn. The game may continue 6.0-0 Nc6 (not 6...Be7? 7.Nxe5! with a tremendous attack, but 6...d6 is also ) 7.Nh4 g6 8.f4 f5 9.Nf3 (9.Nxf5? d5!) e4 10.Ng5 (10.Ne5 Qe7! threatening Qc5+ is strong) Bc5+. In practice, Black&#x27;s lack of and inability to castle can prove very problematic.

Safer for Black are Paul Morphy&#x27;s solid 5...c6 6.Nxe5 d5, returning the pawn with equality, and 4...Nc6 (instead of 4...Nxc3) 5.0-0 (5.Nxe4 d5) Nxc3 6.dxc3 Qe7! when, according to Bobby Fischer in &quot;My 60 Memorable Games&quot;, &quot;White has no compensation for the pawn.&quot;

Black can also decline the pawn with 3...Nc6, transposing into the Two Knights Defense. He must, however, be willing to offer a gambit himself after 4.Ng5. White may invite an offshoot of the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit with 4.0-0 Nxe4 5.Nc3.

Irregular move orders are 2.Nc3 (Vienna) Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nf3 and 2.Nf3 Nf6 (Russian or Petrov Defence) 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nc3.

====Summary after 2...Nf6====
*3.Nc3 (Vienna Game, by transposition)
*3.d3
*3.d4 (Ponziani&#x27;s Gambit)
**3...exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 (Center Game, by transposition)
**3...exd4 4.Nf3 (Urusov Gambit)
***4...Bc5 5.0-0 Nc6 (Max Lange Attack, by transposition)
***4...Nc6 (Two Knights Defense, by transposition)
***4...Nxe4 5.Qxd4 (Urusov Gambit Accepted)
*3.Nf3 (Petrov&#x27;s Defense, by transposition)
**3...Nxe4 4.Nc3 (Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit)
*3.f4 (Greco Gambit)
**3...Nxe4 4.d3 Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 or 5...e4
**3...exf4 (King&#x27;s Gambit, by transposition)

===Classical Defense: 2...Bc5 ===



The Classical Defense (also known as the Boi Variation) is Black&#x27;s symmetrical response, 2...Bc5.
White can then transpose into the Vienna Game (3.Nc3) or the Giuoco Piano (3.Nf3 Nc6), or remain in the Bishop&#x27;s Opening with the Wing Gambit (3.b4) or the Philidor Variation (3.c3). The main line of the Philidor Variation runs: 3.c3 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.e5 d5! 6.exf6 dxc4 7.Qh5 0-0 8.Qxc5 Re8+ 9.Ne2 d3 10.Be3. Transpositions into the King&#x27;s Gambit Declined and the Giuoco Piano are also possible after 3.d3.

The Wing Gambit results in positions similar to those in the Evans Gambit. It can transpose into the Evans Gambit, for instance by 3.b4 Bxb4 4.c3 Ba5 5.Nf3 Nc6. It can also lead to the Four Pawns Gambit after 3... Bxb4 4. f4 exf4 5. Nf3 Be7 6. d4 Bh4+ 7. g3 fxg3 8. 0-0 gxh2+ 9. Kh1

Black&#x27;s most energetic response to the Philidor Variation is the Lewis Countergambit, 3.c3 d5, named for the English player and author William Lewis (1787–1870) who published analysis of the line in 1834.

Among amateurs, 3.Qf3 and 3.Qh5 are also popular, threatening an immediate Scholar&#x27;s mate. But the threat is easily met (e.g. 3.Qh5 Qe7) and the moves are considered inferior since they hamper White&#x27;s development or leave the queen exposed, leading to loss of tempo. As a well known attack, these moves are mostly blocked by Black, who can smash the whole strategy in one move, like Qe7 or Nh6.

====Summary after 2...Bc5====
*3.b4 (Wing Gambit)
*3.c3 (Philidor Variation)
**3...d5 (Lewis Countergambit)
**3...d6
**3...Nf6
*3.Nc3 (Vienna Game, by transposition)
*3.d3
*3.Nf3 Nc6 (Giuoco Piano, by transposition)
*3.Qg4

===Other Black responses===

Other Black second moves are rarely played. If Black tries to transpose into the Hungarian Defense with 2...Be7?, then 3.Qh5 wins a pawn.

The Calabrese Countergambit (2...f5) is named after Greco&#x27;s homeland, Calabria. It is considered dubious, as the line recommended by Carl Jaenisch, 3.d3 Nf6 4.f4 d6 5.Nf3, gives White the advantage. Other analyses, however, have found that the sharp 3.f4! or safe 3.Nc3 are better for White than 3.d3.

====Summary of other Black responses====
*2...c6 (Philidor Counterattack)
*2...d6
*2...f5?! (Calabrese Countergambit)
**3.d3 (Jaenisch Variation)

<text>The Konstantinopolsky Opening is a rarely played chess opening that begins with the moves as illustrated below:

:1. 
:2. 
:3. 
==Description==
The opening was first played in the game Alexander Konstantinopolsky versus Viacheslav Ragozin, Moscow 1956.

The Konstantinopolsky Opening is rarely seen at the top levels of chess, although some grandmasters such as Savielly Tartakower (who played many unusual openings) have experimented with it. Black is considered to achieve an easy game with the natural and strong 3...Nf6 4.d3 d5.

== Racial controversies ==
During the 1990s and early 2000s, San Marin received significant media coverage locally and nationally for the intolerant behavior of some students and parents.

Until it was banned in 1992, one of several themed annual &quot;spirit days&quot; was Slave Day. According to a 1999 Salon article written on the school&#x27;s history, &quot;students dressed in tattered clothes and chains were &quot;auctioned&quot; to other students, whom they were then required to serve for the day.&quot; Images of this day from the 1987-1988 year book circulated in 2020, drawing shock from students and community members.

Reports of racial and ethnic intolerance began as early as 1995, when an American-born Asian-American senior at the school was beaten by a group of teenagers shouting racial slurs and telling him to go back to China. The one assailant who took responsibility was sentenced to 20 hours of community service.

In early 1998, a student yelled racial epithets at members of the visiting Tamalpais High School basketball team. In reaction to the slurs and actions committed by the San Marin High student, parents of four of the black students from Tamalpais filed suit against the Novato Unified School District, charging that a &quot;climate of intolerance&quot; was allowed at San Marin. The Marin County Athletic League put San Marin on probation for more than a year, citing its &quot;hostile environment&quot;.

In the 1998–99 school year, San Marin received widespread media coverage after repeated incidents of hate crimes committed against one of their openly gay students. He was beaten by three youths off campus on September 15, 1998, soon after forming the Gay-Straight Alliance at San Marin. The Novato Police offered a reward, but the attackers were never identified. Some students at the school, which had been stressing tolerance at a series of &quot;respect days&quot; that year, spoke out in support of the victim and 1000 students and faculty walked out of San Marin to show support for him and pride in their school. The next day, San Marin&#x27;s principal was reassigned to a District office. Novato&#x27;s city manager, Rod Wood, referred to &quot;a small group of individuals who are fairly socially maladjusted&quot;, who identified themselves as white supremacists and called themselves &quot;the hicks&quot;.

The school&#x27;s behavior code was modified, outlining a range of punishments for racial/ethnic/sexual slurs including reprimand, parental notification, detention on Saturday afternoon, expulsion and police referral.

Misbehavior by the parents of a San Marin basketball player on February 2, 2008, in two games with Tam High teams led to drafting of the first code-of-conduct contracts for parents of athletes at a Marin County school. Following a girls junior varsity game at Tam, the mother of a San Marin player followed two referees, shouting obscene insults; later at San Marin, two parents of San Marin players confronted Tam&#x27;s coach after he made a gesture indicating that the home team had choked. Novato police were called and the parents were later asked not to attend the remaining games of the season.

In 2022, Novato Unified School district led a probe into a group of incidents where San Marin athletes used racial slurs during basketball and football games. The probe found “credible evidence” that San Marin athletes used racial slurs during games against San Rafael High, San Mateo High, and Tamalpais High.

<doc id="1272373" wikidata="Q505763" url="?curid=1272373" title="Three Knights Game">
<text>The Three Knights Game is a chess opening which most commonly begins with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

In the Three Knights Game, Black chooses to break symmetry in order to avoid the main lines of what is often considered the drawish Four Knights Game after the usual 3...Nf6.

The relevant &quot;ECO&quot; code is C46.
==Black&#x27;s third move==
After tries such as 3...d6 or 3...Be7, White can play 4.d4, leaving Black with a cramped position resembling Philidor&#x27;s Defense. If Black plays 3...Bc5 instead, White can eliminate Black&#x27;s outpost at e5: 4.Nxe5 Nxe5 5.d4 Bd6 6.dxe5 Bxe5. Since tournament praxis shows the line seems to favor White, Black usually plays 3...Bb4 or 3...g6, the Steinitz Defense. Continuations then are typically 3...Bb4 4.Nd5 and 3...g6 4.d4 exd4 5.Nd5.

Another alternative for Black is 3...f5, the Winawer Defense (or Gothic Defense). Then 4.Bb5 transposes into the Schliemann Defense of the Ruy Lopez.

The Three Knights is almost never seen at master level nowadays, as Black players have sought more active tries, even within the Four Knights.

==Reversed knight position==
The similar position with Black having moved ...Nf6 is called Petrov&#x27;s Three Knights Game, although it too usually leads to the Four Knights Game.

==Example game==

Rosenthal vs. Steinitz, 1873: 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 4.d4 exd4 5.Nxd4 Bg7 6.Be3 Nge7 7.Bc4 d6 8.0-0 0-0 9.f4 Na5 10.Bd3 d5 11.exd5 Nxd5 12.Nxd5 Qxd5 13.c3 Rd8 14.Qc2 Nc4 15.Bxc4 Qxc4 16.Qf2 c5 17.Nf3 b6 18.Ne5 Qe6 19.Qf3 Ba6 20.Rfe1 f6 21.Ng4 h5 22.Nf2 Qf7 23.f5 g5 24.Rad1 Bb7 25.Qg3 Rd5 26.Rxd5 Qxd5 27.Rd1 Qxf5 28.Qc7 Bd5 29.b3 Re8 30.c4 Bf7 31.Bc1 Re2 32.Rf1 Qc2 33.Qg3 Qxa2 34.Qb8+ Kh7 35.Qg3 Bg6 36.h4 g4 37.Nd3 Qxb3 38.Qc7 Qxd3 0–1

<text>Andong Science College is a small technical college in Seohu-myeon, Andong City, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea. It employs about 75 full-time instructors. Academic departments include nursing, public health administration, cyber-terror defense, physical therapy, dental hygiene, computer information, information management, and medical engineering. The campus covers 129,000 m2 and includes a library and gymnasium. The school maintains sister relationships with Ashland University in the United States, and domestically with Kyung Hee University.

==History==
Unlike most technical colleges in South Korea, it began its existence as a public institution, Andong Nursing High School (안동간호고등기술학교), which was founded in 1967. The school was redesignated a technical school in 1972. In 1983, it was officially taken over by a private organization, the Jangchun Educational Foundation (학교법인 장춘학원), and was known as Andong Technical College of Health and Nursing. It became a general technical college in 1992. The school took on its current name, Andong Science College, in 1998.

In the fall of 1997, the Department of Tourism English began using native English speakers to augment their English programs. The students eventually worked in the travel industry across South Korea.

At that time the department hired Brian Curneal and Christopher Brogan of Lansing, MI to teach ESL and Conversational English. Both teachers began teaching Conversational English to Elementary school teachers. Later in the spring of 1997 Mr. Curneal and Mr. Brogan began teaching the college freshmen and sophomores conversational English in earnest. They both continued teaching at Angong Junior College, the common English name for the school, until the end of the second semester (fall) of 1997. During their short tenure there they also taught conversational English to many of the school&#x27;s instructors and professors.

<doc id="1272375" wikidata="Q831778" url="?curid=1272375" title="Scotch Game">
<text>The Scotch Game, or Scotch Opening, is a chess opening that begins with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

Ercole del Rio, in his 1750 treatise &quot;Sopra il giuoco degli Scacchi, Osservazioni pratiche d’anonimo Autore Modenese&quot; (&quot;On the game of Chess, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese Author&quot;), was the first author to mention what is now called the Scotch Game. The opening received its name from a correspondence match in 1824 between Edinburgh and London. Popular in the 19th century, by 1900 the Scotch had lost favour among top players because it was thought to release the central tension too early and allow Black to without difficulty. In the 20th century grandmasters Garry Kasparov and Jan Timman helped to re-popularise the Scotch when they used it as a surprise weapon to avoid the well-analysed Ruy Lopez. 
==Analysis==
White aims to dominate the by exchanging their d-pawn for Black&#x27;s e-pawn. Black usually plays 3...exd4, as they have no good way of maintaining their pawn on e5 (this same position can be reached by transposition from the Centre Game 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Nf3 Nc6). After the usual 3...exd4, White can respond with the main line 4.Nxd4 or can play a gambit by offering Black one or two pawns in exchange for rapid .

Other 3rd-move alternatives for Black:
* 3...Nxd4 the Lolli Variation is rarely played. It was popular in the 19th century, and receives five columns of analysis in Freeborough and Ranken&#x27;s opening manual &quot;Chess Openings Ancient and Modern&quot; (3rd ed. 1896 p. 53). It is often described today as a strategic error, since after 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.Qxd4 (5.Bc4 is the Napoleon Gambit) White&#x27;s queen stands on a central square, and is developed too early since it cannot be chased away very effectively (5...c5 is a seriously weakening move that blocks Black&#x27;s ). Nonetheless, the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;ECO&quot;) concludes that Black with 5...Ne7 6.Bc4 Nc6 7.Qd5 Qf6 8.0-0 Ne5 9.Be2 c6 10.Qb3 Ng6 11.f4 Bc5+ 12.Kh1 d6 (I. Sokolov). Similarly, Harald Keilhack concludes in &quot;Knight on the Left: 1.Nc3&quot; (p. 21) that although ...Nxd4 is a &quot;non-line&quot; these days, if Black continues perfectly it is not clear that White gets even a small advantage. Keilhack analyses 5.Qxd4 d6 6.Nc3 Nf6 7.Bc4 Be7 8.0-0 0-0 9.Bg5 c6 10.a4 Qa5 11.Bh4 and now after 11...Qe5 or 11...Be6, &quot;White has at most this indescribable nothingness which is the advantage of the first move.&quot; (&quot;Id.&quot; p. 25) The &quot;ECO&quot; also concludes that Black equalises after the alternative 4.Nxe5 Ne6 5.Bc4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Be3 d6 9.Nd3 Nxe4 10.Nxe4 d5 (Parma). The main line 3...exd4 4.Nxd4 may transpose into this position if Black chooses to play 4...Nxd4.
* 3...d6 is often regarded as a mistake and an automatic slight advantage for White. While 3...d6 does defend the e5-pawn, it allows White to play 4.d5 and kick out the knight. The resulting line of 4...Nce7 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Ng6 allows White an imposing centre and better chances for winning. Opting to take on e5 still scores poorly for Black, as 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ leaves Black in a losing dilemma: either take with the king and forgo castling rights (5...Kxd8), or to take with the c6-knight and lose the e5-pawn (5...Nxd8 6.Nxe5). Chess.com cites a meager 18% win rate for Black&#x27;s 3...d6 move. Alternatively, White is better after 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Bc4, or they may simply play 4.Bb5, when 4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7 transposes to the Steinitz Defence in the Ruy Lopez.
* 3...f5 the Isa Gambit variation 4.Nxe5 transposes into a line of the dubious Latvian Gambit.

==Main variations==

After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4, the most important continuations are:
* 4.Nxd4 (Main line)
** 4...Bc5 (Classical Variation)
** 4...Nf6 (Schmidt Variation)
** 4...Qh4 (Steinitz Variation)
** 4...Qf6
** 4...Nxd4
** 4...Bb4+
* 4.Bc4 (Scotch Gambit)
* 4.c3 (Göring Gambit)
* 4.Bb5 (Relfsson Gambit)

===Main line: 4.Nxd4 ===

In the main line after 4.Nxd4, Black has two major options. Either 4...Bc5 or 4...Nf6 offers Black good chances for an equal game.

====Classical Variation: 4...Bc5 ====

After 4...Bc5 White has 5.Be3, 5.Nxc6, or 5.Nb3. 

On 5.Be3 play almost always continues 5...Qf6 6.c3 Nge7 7.Bc4 (as proposed by IM Gary Lane in &quot;Winning with the Scotch&quot;; several seventh move alternatives for White are possible here, 7.g3 for example) 7...Ne5 seems Black&#x27;s strongest reply. Play usually continues 8.Be2 (white allows Ne5 with tempo to enable a potential f4 counter). 8... Qg6 (8...d5 is also possible) 9.0-0. Here, White allows Black the option of taking the unprotected pawn on e4, but it is considered &quot;poisoned&quot;.) 8.0-0 Bb6 where the position is roughly equal. 

After 5.Nxc6, play almost always continues 5...Qf6 (Black does not lose a piece on c6 because he is threatening mate with 6...Qxf2) 6.Qd2 dxc6 7.Nc3, or 6.Qf3 dxc6 followed by either 7.Bc4 or 7.Nc3. 

On 5.Nb3 play almost always continues 5...Bb6 6.Nc3, or alternatively 5...Bb6 6. a4 a6 7.Nc3. After 6.Nc3, White usually follows with (in some order) Qe2, Be3 or Bg5.

====Schmidt Variation: 4...Nf6 ====
After 4...Nf6 White has 5.Nxc6 (the Mieses Variation) or 5.Nc3 (the Scotch Four Knights Game). After 5.Nc3 almost always played is 5...Bb4 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.Bd3 d5 8.exd5 cxd5 9.0-0 0-0 10.Bg5 c6. After 5.Nxc6 bxc6 6.e5 Qe7 7.Qe2 Nd5 8.c4 is also very common. Where these main lines end, the first real opening decisions are made, which are too specific for this overview.

====Steinitz Variation: 4...Qh4!? ====
Steinitz&#x27;s 4...Qh4!? almost wins a pawn by force, but White gets a lead in development and attacking chances as compensation. As of 2005, White&#x27;s most successful line has been 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.Be2 Qxe4 7.Nb5 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Kd8 9.0-0, from which Black&#x27;s awkwardly placed king has generally proven more significant than the extra pawn.

===Scotch Gambit: 4.Bc4 ===

Instead of 4.Nxd4, White has two ways to offer a gambit. The Scotch Gambit starts with 4.Bc4. The Scotch Gambit may also be reached via the Italian Gambit by 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d4 exd4; however, this move order gives Black the option of avoiding the Scotch with 4...Bxd4. After 4.Bc4, Black can transpose into the 4.d4 exd4 line of the Two Knights Defence with 4...Nf6, or continue 4...Bc5, when White has three main options.

* 5.c3, dubbed the Haxo Gambit by Eric Schiller, has little independent significance. Most popular and probably best is 5...Nf6, transposing into a variation of the Giuoco Piano in which Black is known to have a satisfactory game. Black can instead accept the gambit with 5...dxc3, but this is riskier because White will gain a lead in development after 6.Bxf7+ Kxf7 7.Qd5+ and Qxc5. Alternatively, Black may decline the gambit with 5...d3, opening the diagonal for the bishop on c5 and depriving White&#x27;s knight of its most natural square, c3.

* 5.0-0 usually leads to the Max Lange Attack after 5...Nf6 6.e5.

* 5.Ng5!?, with the idea of 5...Nh6 (best) 6.Nxf7 Nxf7 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qh5+ g6 9.Qxc5, regaining the material. This line violates normal opening principles by moving a piece twice, attacking before development is complete, and placing the queen where it is exposed to attack. For this reason it has traditionally been considered inferior, perhaps influenced by the well-known game Meek–Morphy, Mobile 1855. The line has more recently appeared in grandmaster play, however, and seems to offer both sides approximately equal chances. Black can equalise with either 9...d5 (Black&#x27;s latent threats of ...Nb4 and ...Re8+ prevent capturing the d5-pawn; if 10.Bf4 dxe4 11.Nd2 Re8 12.0-0-0 Bf5 and Black has the upper hand Parma]) or 9...d6 (taking advantage of White&#x27;s exposed queen). 

The Black response 4...Bb4+ to the Scotch Gambit is called the London Defence.

===Göring Gambit: 4.c3 ===

The Göring Gambit is a relative of the Danish Gambit which starts with 4.c3. White sacrifices one or two pawns in return for a lead in development, and typically follows up by putting pressure on f7 with Bc4, Qb3 and sometimes Ng5, while Nc3–d5 is another common motif. The &quot;Oxford Companion to Chess&quot; notes that the gambit was first played at high levels by Howard Staunton in the 1840s, and the earliest game with it was probably played in 1843. The first game with the gambit accepted may be Meek–Morphy, New York 1857. Carl Theodor Göring introduced it into master play in 1872, but while Göring&#x27;s name is most often associated with the one-pawn gambit (5.Nxc3), Göring invariably used the double-pawn gambit with 5.Bc4. The gambit has been played by Ljubomir Ljubojević, David Bronstein, Frank Marshall, and Jonathan Penrose. In casual games, Alexander Alekhine often transposed to it via the move order 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3, when ...Nc6 for Black and Nf3 for White often followed. In general, the opening is unpopular at master level but is more popular at club level. It is recommended to study the Göring Gambit in connection with the Danish.

====Declined: 4...d5====
Black can equalise by transposing to the Danish Declined with 4...d5, when the critical line runs 5.exd5 Qxd5 6.cxd4 Bg4 7.Be2 Bb4+ 8.Nc3 Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Qc4 (or 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 Bg4 8.Be2 Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Qc4, leading to the same position), often referred to as the Capablanca Variation in view of the strength of Black&#x27;s concept in the game Marshall–Capablanca, Lake Hopatcong 1926. This line (which can also arise from the Chigorin Defence to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit), forcing White to either exchange queens or forgo the right to castle with the risky 10.Be3, deters many players from employing this gambit. Equal endgames result after either 10.Qb3 Qxb3 11.axb3 Nge7 or 10.Bxc6+ bxc6 11.Qe2+ Qxe2+ 12.Kxe2 Ne7. If Black avoids steering for Capablanca&#x27;s ending, e.g. with 6...Nf6 or 7...0-0-0 in the above lines, then White obtains good piece play in return for the isolated d-pawn. White can deviate with 6...Bg4 7.Nc3, with the idea of meeting 7...Bb4 with 8.a3 (or 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 Bg4 8.a3) or the rare 5.Bd3, neither of which promise an advantage but which avoid those endings.

====Other ways of declining====
Black can also decline with 4...Nf6, transposing to a line of the Ponziani Opening. The continuation 5.e5 Ne4 was endorsed by &quot;Dangerous Weapons, 1.e4 e5&quot; (Everyman Chess, 2008), but Tim Harding considers 5...Nd5 a better try for equality, when White can continue 6.Bb5 a6 7.Ba4 Nb6 8.Bb3, 6.Qb3, 6.Bc4 or 6.cxd4. Another possibility is 4...Nge7 intending 5...d5, when the critical continuation is 5.Bc4 d5 6.exd5 Nxd5 7.0-0. According to IM John Watson, Black may be able to equalise with 7...Be7. Declining with 4...d3, however, allows White some advantage after 5.Bxd3 d6 6.Bf4 Be7 7.h3 Nf6 8.Nbd2 Bd7 9.Qc2 according to &quot;Batsford Chess Openings 2&quot;.

====One-pawn gambit: 4...dxc3 5.Nxc3 ====
If Black accepts the gambit with 4...dxc3, White can commit to sacrificing only one pawn with 5.Nxc3. Black&#x27;s most critical response is generally considered to be 5...Bb4, when White does not get enough compensation after 6.Bc4 d6 7.0-0 Bxc3 8.bxc3 Nf6!, when 9.Ba3 Bg4 is insufficient and 9.e5 Nxe5 10.Nxe5 dxe5 11.Qb3 (11.Qxd8+ Kxd8 12.Bxf7 Ke7 is also good for Black) 11...Qe7 12.Ba3 c5 does not give enough compensation for two pawns. White can deviate with 7.Qb3, when the old main line runs 7...Qe7 8.0-0 Bxc3, and here 9.Qxc3 gives White good compensation. Thus both John Watson and USCF master Mark Morss recommend 7...Bxc3+, in order to meet 8.Qxc3 with 8...Qf6! when White loses too much time with the queen. Thus White often continues 8.bxc3 when 8...Qe7 9.0-0 Nf6 can be met by 10.e5 (transposing back to lines arising from 7.0-0 Bxc3 8.bxc3 Nf6 9.e5, though these are insufficient for White) or the relatively unexplored 10.Bg5. Other deviations for White include 7.Ng5 and 6.Bg5.

Black&#x27;s main alternative is 5...d6, which usually leads to complications and approximately equal chances after 6.Bc4 Nf6 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Ng5 Ne5 9.Bb5 c6 10.f4, or 7.Ng5 Ne5 8.Bb3 h6 9.f4. 5...Bc5 is also playable, transposing to the Scotch Gambit after 6.Bc4 but cutting out the Bxf7+ possibility. 5...Nf6 6.Bc4 can transpose back to 5...d6 lines after 6...d6, or Black can attempt to transpose to 5...Bb4 lines with 6...Bb4, but this allows 7.e5 d5 8.exf6 dxc4 9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.fxg7 Rg8 11.Bh6.

====Double-pawn gambit: 4...dxc3 5.Bc4 ====
Alternatively, White can transpose into the Danish by offering a second pawn with 5.Bc4 cxb2 6.Bxb2, an approach which John Emms considers far more dangerous for Black. If Black does not accept the second pawn with 5...cxb2, then White can avoid Black&#x27;s most critical response to 5.Nxc3 (5...Bb4 6.Bc4 d6). For instance, after 5...d6, White&#x27;s best is 6.Nxc3, transposing back to the 5.Nxc3 d6 line. 5...Nf6 6.Nxc3 transposes to the 5.Nxc3 Nf6 line, 5...Bb4 is well met by 6.0-0 or 6.bxc3 (transposing to the Scotch Gambit), 5...Bc5 also transposes to the Scotch Gambit while 5...Be7?! (which is well met by 6.Qd5) transposes to the Hungarian Defence.

Thus Black&#x27;s most critical response is to take the second pawn with 5...cxb2 6.Bxb2. Unlike in the Danish proper, having committed the to c6, Black cannot safely meet 6.Bxb2 with 6...d5. Instead, play often continues 6...d6 7.0-0 Be6 8.Bxe6 fxe6 9.Qb3 Qd7 or 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Bc3 Nh6. 6...Bb4+ is the main alternative for Black, whereupon an approach with castling is considered dangerous for Black, e.g. 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.Qc2 d6 9.0-0-0.

<text>Novato High School (NHS) is a public high school located in Novato, California, in Marin County. It is one of three high schools part of the Novato Unified School District.

==History==

Built in 1955 and founded in 1958, three years before Novato was incorporated as a city, it is one of two comprehensive high schools in the Novato Unified School District, the other being San Marin High School.

==Demographics==

Since the mid-1980s, the school&#x27;s student population has ranged from 1000 to 1200 students.
In the 2018–2019 school year, the demographic distribution was as follows: Caucasian (46.7%), Latino (38.1%), Asian/Other Asian (6.2%), Two or More Races (4.7%), African American (2.8%), Native American (1.1%) and Pacific Islander (0.4%).

==Campus==

NHS rests on a 38-acre site, with two gymnasiums, a Lecture Hall/Performing Arts Center, three computer centers, a library with a computer lab, dance studio, weight room, locker rooms, a wing for visual art classrooms, and a wing for music classrooms. Outdoor facilities include tennis courts, basketball courts, softball diamond, baseball stadium, turf football stadium with a track, soccer field, and a newly renovated swimming pool.

One of the most exciting aspects of the climate and culture of the school is the dynamic Leadership class (ASB). Another student-led organization on campus is the Link Crew (since 2015). Link Crew has 11 and 12 grade students act as mentors and role models for the incoming 9 grade class to help in the transition from middle to high school.

==Curriculum==

Novato High School has several comprehensive academic program including college preparatory courses, Honors and Advanced Placement classes, fine and performing arts classes, and industrial arts courses. Novato High School also provides support services such as the English Language Development (ELD) Programs for those students who require additional resources. Advanced Placement offerings include: AP Music Theory, AP Art History, AP Human Geography, AP European History, AP US History, AP Government, AP Economics, Calculus AB/BC, AP Biology, AP Physics, AP Stats, AP English Language, AP English Literature, AP Studio Art and AP Spanish.

Novato High School is home to the Marin Design Center, which houses the Product Design and Programming classes. This innovative College and Career pathway program gives students the resources and opportunity to take their talent and ingenuity to the next level with guidance from Mr. Glenn Corey. NHS Product Design students will get the training necessary to advance on to Engineering, Robotics, Design, Physics, and Programming in college or eventually receiving certification for employment.

==Performing and visual arts==

Marin School of the Arts (MSA) has many notable programs, including Dance, Theatre, Musical Theatre, Visual Arts, Creative Writing, Film, and a music program that includes 3 jazz bands, a concert band, a symphonic band, and chamber and rock groups. Jazz and music studies is currently headed by Grammy nominated musician, Dr Greg Johnson. The Rock Band program is run by Scott Thunes, bassist for Frank Zappa. MSA was founded in 2003 by Mark Peabody.

==Athletics==
Novato competes in the Marin County Athletic League (MCAL). Novato is a member of the North Coast Section(NCS) of the California Interscholastic Federation.

===Lacrosse===
The girls&#x27; lacrosse program has won both the MCAL and NCS (division 1) title four years in a row, spanning from 2015 to 2018. The program has been dominant with an overall record of 95–5 in these four years. In the early 2010s, the team petitioned to play up in the strongest division of the NCS (division 1) for all four of these championships. The 2016 team was undefeated and ranked #24 nationally. The team&#x27;s national presence increased in 2017, the team was ranked #12 in the nation and #2 in California. By 2018, the teams’ national ranking increased to #8 and topped the 4-peat off with a #1 overall ranking in the state.

The boys&#x27; lacrosse program has won three (MCAL) county championships, once in 2005 and again in 2011, and once more in 2013. In 2013, they went on to go to the NCS final, where they once again met Redwood, this time in the championship, where they lost.

Both the Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; programs have Varsity and JV teams.

===Football===
The Hornets football program went to six NCS Division 2A/3 championships in 7 years, winning in 2002, 2005, 2006 &amp; 2007. On Dec. 9th, 2007, the varsity football team was elected to play in California&#x27;s Div. II State Championship in Carson, CA. Novato lost to Oceanside of San Diego, 28–14 after a significant loss of their quarterback due to leg injury.

Novato&#x27;s most recent notable season for varsity was 2014 as they were crowned MCAL champions. 2017 is the most notable for Junior Varsity, as they went 7–2. Novato has not had a freshman team since 2015, yet won the Freshman MCAL title in 2013 and 2011.

In July 2017, Novato&#x27;s varsity football team was dropped due to lack of summer turnout. The school&#x27;s loss gained local media coverage and was revived due to a player and parent push for fellow students to fill the spots of the team.

The program has both JV and Varsity teams.

Former Stanford All American and Chicago Bears defensive lineman Roger Stillwell coached the varsity football team in the 1980s.

===Soccer===
The boys&#x27; soccer team came in first in the North Coast Section tournament for the first time in school history in 2007 beating Marin Catholic 1–0. As of the 2018–19 season, Novato had both Varsity and Junior Varsity for Boys and Girls&#x27; programs.

===Baseball===
The baseball program has won four MCAL titles and won the North Coast Section championship in the spring of 2007.

Novato offers both JV and Varsity teams as of 2023.

In 2020, spearheaded by the class of 2020 and parents alike, Novato’s baseball field was resurfaced with turf while its surrounding facilities were given a thorough facelift.

<text>Whiston Rural District was a rural district of the administrative county of Lancashire, England. It was created in 1895 by renaming the Prescot Rural District when the parish of Prescot was removed from that rural district and created a separate urban district. Later the parish of Speke was incorporated into the City of Liverpool and Ditton into the Municipal Borough of Widnes. In 1922 the parish of Kirkby was added from the disbanded Sefton Rural District and removed again in 1958 when it was created a separate urban district. It was named after and administered from Whiston. In 1934 and 1954 parts of Windle and Eccleston were removed and placed in St Helens CB

The district was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974. Its ten civil parishes were split between the Merseyside metropolitan boroughs of Knowsley and St Helens and the Cheshire boroughs of Halton and Warrington as follows:

*Cronton (Knowsley)
*Halewood (Knowsley)
*Knowsley (Knowsley)
*Tarbock (Knowsley)
*Whiston (Knowsley)
*Eccleston (St Helens)
*Rainhill (St Helens)

<text>The Southeast Symphony Association is a non-profit, musical and cultural association located in Inglewood, California.

The association was founded in 1948 by music teacher Mabel Massengill Gunn. Gunn&#x27;s goal was to create an orchestra that welcomed African-American musicians, music teachers and patrons of the arts in an era during which the classical music world was still predominantly segregated. As of 2010, the association&#x27;s orchestra remains the longest continuously performing primarily African-American orchestra in the world. Alumni of the association&#x27;s orchestra have gone on to perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra and the El Paso Opera Company.

The group currently offers musical classes to students of various ages through the Los Angeles Unified School District. The association has a sponsorship relationship with the Nissan car company. The current Music Director and Conductor of the symphony is Anthony R. Parnther.

<doc id="1272386" wikidata="Q2524684" url="?curid=1272386" title="Greco Defence">
<text>The Greco Defence (or McConnell Defence), named after Gioachino Greco (c. 1600 – c. 1634), is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

:1. 
:2. 

The opening is categorised by &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; as code C40.
==Discussion==
Of the several plausible ways Black has to defend his e-pawn, 2...Qf6 is considered one of the weaker choices, since the queen is prematurely and can become a target for attack. Also, the black knight on g8 is deprived of its most natural square. There is, however, no obvious refutation of this opening; White&#x27;s advantage consists mainly of smoother development.

Although it is a popular opening choice by novice players, it has also been used by players who, according to International Master Gary Lane, &quot;should know better&quot;.

==Examples==

===Greco line===
Greco himself illustrated the following amusing line against this defence in 1620:
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 3. Bc4 Qg6 4. 0-0 Qxe4 5. Bxf7+!! Ke7 
:5...Kxf7 6.Ng5+! wins the black queen.

6. Re1 Qf4 7. Rxe5+ Kxf7
:7...Kd8 8.Re8

8. d4 Qf6 9. Ng5+ Kg6 10. Qd3+ Kh6 11. Nf7# 

===McConnell game===

Morphy vs. McConnell, New Orleans 1849:
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 3. Nc3 c6 4. d4 exd4 5. e5 Qg6 6. Bd3
:6.Qxd4 gives White a big lead in development.

6... Qxg2 7. Rg1 Qh3 8. Rg3 Qh5 9. Rg5 Qh3 10. Bf1 Qe6 11. Nxd4 (diagram) 
:... and Morphy was better.

===Busch game===
Paulsen vs. Busch, Düsseldorf 1863:
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 3. Bc4 Nh6
:Making some sense, since Black is able to respond ...Qxh6 if White were to play d4 followed by Bxh6.

4. 0-0 Bc5 5. Nc3 c6 6. d4! Bxd4 7. Nxd4 exd4 8. e5 Qg6 9. Qxd4
:And again, White is ahead in development.

<text>Medlow Bath (postcode: 2780) is a village located near the highest point of the Blue Mountains, New South Wales, Australia. Located between and , its altitude is about . It is about west-north-west of the Sydney central business district and north-west of Katoomba. At the 2016 census, Medlow Bath had a population of 611 people.

==Description and history==

Medlow Bath is set in a semi-rural area which includes fire-prone eucalypt forest, and has been subject to bushfire threats many times during its history.

The Hydro Majestic Hotel was developed by Sydney businessman, Mark Foy in the early years of the twentieth century and was the main economic activity in the area, until bushfires nearly destroyed the hotel in the summer of 2003.

There is an elaborate network of walking tracks, which were developed in the bushland between the hotel and the escarpment of the Megalong Valley. The tracks offer scope for many fine bushwalks and views of the Megalong Valley, but in more recent years have deteriorated due to lack of maintenance. Other tracks in the area include Bruce&#x27;s Walk, an old track that was upgraded by bushwalkers and other volunteers in the 1980s. Bruce&#x27;s Walk is located a few kilometres east of Medlow Bath, on the fringes of the Blue Mountains National Park, a huge park that is now a World Heritage Site.

Australia&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, died at the Hydro Majestic Hotel in 1920.

Medlow Bath was originally known as Brown&#x27;s Siding when it gave its name to a railway siding in 1880 because Brown&#x27;s Sawmill was the main business in the area. In 1883, the town was renamed Medlow because there was another Brown&#x27;s Siding near Lithgow.

==Heritage listings==
Medlow Bath has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks
* Beauchamp Road: Medlow Dam
* Great Western Highway: Medlow Bath railway station

==Population==
72.9% of people were born in Australia and 85.0% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 39.6%, Catholic 19.1% and Anglican 11.0%.

==Transport==

Medlow Bath was connected to the Main Western railway line in 1880, when the station was called Brown&#x27;s Siding. Medlow Bath railway station is now served by the Blue Mountains Line.

The Great Western Highway is the main road access route.

Katoomba Airfield, now disused except in emergency situations, is also located a few kilometres east of Medlow Bath.

Blue Mountains Transit operates two bus routes through the suburb of Medlow Bath:

* 698: Katoomba to Blackheath
* 698V: Katoomba to Mount Victoria

<doc id="1272406" wikidata="Q2903791" url="?curid=1272406" title="Fatah Hawks">
<text>The Fatah Hawks is the name of two Palestinian militant groups. One is a popular movement of Palestinian youth in the West Bank and Gaza in the 1980s. The other is an offshoot of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades which has links to the dominant Fatah movement. The group has carried out attacks against Israeli military personnel in the Gaza Strip and were regarded as Yasser Arafat&#x27;s &quot;own troops&quot;.

During the First Intifada that started in 1987, the Hawks were led by young Palestinians in the large cities of Nablus, Tulkarm, Ramallah and Bethlehem in the West Bank, and Gaza City and Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. Most of their attacks were carried out using improvised weapons; stone throwing, stabbing attacks, and use of stolen firearms. The amount of weaponry that they received from PLO sources outside of Israel was negligible, and most of their successes were in the use of stabbing attacks or roadside ambushes of Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian territories. This organisation was disbanded under the provisions of the Oslo Accords. However, they continued to operate until 1997 as Arafat&#x27;s personal stormtroopers against rival factions.

The group reappeared during the Al-Aqsa Intifada by claiming joint responsibility with Hamas for an attack on the Rafah border crossing on the Israeli military-controlled Egyptian border crossing with Gaza near Rafah on December 12, 2004, which resulted in five Israeli soldiers being killed and ten others wounded. Hawk member Yasser Abu Samahdaneh was responsible for the death of &quot;at least&quot; 35 Arabs, many of whom were &quot;personal enemies or political rivals he arbitrarily executed,&quot; and of killing Yehoshua Weisbrod, an Israeli.

Following the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004, the Fatah hawks suffered like many other Fatah-based militant groups from increasing Palestinian apathy as the corrupt and old faced style Fatah lost public confidence in favour of Hamas.

The number of attacks have decreased. The Fatah Hawks&#x27; last activity was in 2005 when Fatah Hawk gunmen blockaded a Palestinian road and prevented Palestinian National Authority (PA) officials from passing in protest at not being assigned to the PA security system.

<text>An accounting information system (AIS) is a system of collecting, storing and processing financial and accounting data that are used by decision makers. An accounting information system is generally a computer-based method for tracking accounting activity in conjunction with information technology resources. The resulting financial reports can be used internally by management or externally by other interested parties including investors, creditors and tax authorities. Accounting information systems are designed to support all accounting functions and activities including auditing, financial accounting porting, -managerial/ management accounting and tax. The most widely adopted accounting information systems are auditing and financial reporting modules.

==History==
Traditionally, accounting is purely based on a manual approach. The experience and skillfulness of an individual accountant are critical in accounting processes. Even using the manual approach can be ineffective and inefficient. Accounting information systems resolve many of the above issues. AISs can support the automation of processing a large amounts of data and produce timely and accurate information.

Early accounting information systems were designed for payroll functions in 1970s. Initially, accounting information systems were developed &quot;in-house&quot; as no packaged solutions were available. Such solutions were expensive to develop and difficult to maintain. Therefore, many accounting practitioners preferred the manual approach rather than computer-based. Today, accounting information systems are more commonly sold as prebuilt software packages from large vendors such as Microsoft, Sage Group, SAP and Oracle where it is configured and customized to match the organization&#x27;s business processes. Small businesses often use accounting lower costs software packages such as Tally.ERP 9, MYOB and Quickbooks. Large organisations would often choose ERP systems. As the need for connectivity and consolidation between other business systems increased, accounting information systems were merged with larger, more centralized systems enterprise resource planning (ERP). Before, with separate applications to manage different business functions, organizations had to develop complex interfaces for the systems to communicate with each other. In ERP, a system such as an accounting information system is built as a module integrated into a suite of applications that can include manufacturing, supply chain, human resources. These modules are integrated together and are able to access the same data and execute complex business processes. Today, Cloud-based accounting information systems are increasingly popular for both SMEs and large organisations for lower costs. With adoption of accounting information systems, many businesses have removed low skills, transactional, and operational accounting roles.

==An example of architecture==
An AIS typically follows a multitier architecture separating the presentation to the user, application processing and data management in distinct layers. The presentation layer manages how the information is displayed to and viewed by functional users of the system (through mobile devices, web browsers or client application). The entire system is backed by a centralized database that stores all of the data. This can include transactional data generated from the core business processes (purchasing, inventory, accounting) or static, master data that is referenced when processing data (employee and customer account records and configuration settings). As transactions occur, the data is collected from the business events and stored into the system&#x27;s database where it can be retrieved and processed into information that is useful for making decisions. The application layer retrieves the raw data held in the log database layer, processes it based on the configured business logic and passes it onto the presentation layer to display to the users. For example, consider the accounts payable department when processing an invoice. With an accounting information system, an accounts payable clerk enters the invoice, provided by a vendor, into the system where it is then stored in the database. When goods from the vendor are received, a receipt is created and also entered into the AIS. Before the accounts payable department pays the vendor, the system&#x27;s application processing tier performs a three-way matching where it automatically matches the amounts on the invoice against the amounts on the receipt and the initial purchase order. Once the match is complete, an email is sent to an accounts payable manager for approval. From here a voucher can be created and the vendor can ultimately be paid.

==Advantages and implications==
A big advantage of computer-based accounting information systems is that they automate and streamline reporting, develop advanced modelling and support data mining. Reporting is major tool for organizations to accurately see summarized, timely information used for decision-making and financial reporting. The accounting information system pulls data from the centralized database, processes and transforms it and ultimately generates a summary of that data as information that can now be easily consumed and analyzed by business analysts, managers or other decision makers. These systems must ensure that the reports are timely so that decision-makers are not acting on old, irrelevant information and, rather, able to act quickly and effectively based on report results. Consolidation is one of the hallmarks of reporting as people do not have to look through an enormous number of transactions. For instance, at the end of the month, a financial accountant consolidates all the paid vouchers by running a report on the system. The system&#x27;s application layer provides a report with the total amount paid to its vendors for that particular month. With large corporations that generate large volumes of transactional data, running reports with even an AIS can take days or even weeks.

After the wave of corporate scandals from large companies such as Tyco International, Enron and WorldCom, major emphasis was put on enforcing public companies to implement strong internal controls into their transaction-based systems. This was made into law with the passage of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 which stipulated that companies must generate an internal control report stating who is responsible for an organization&#x27;s internal control structure and outlines the overall effectiveness of these controls. Since most of these scandals were rooted in the companies&#x27; accounting practices, much of the emphasis of Sarbanes Oxley was put on computer-based accounting information systems. Today, AIS vendors tout their governance, risk management, and compliance features to ensure business processes are robust and protected and the organization&#x27;s assets (including data) are secured.

==Implementation==

Many large and SMEs are now adopting cost effective cloud-based accounting information system in recent years. However the majority of existing automated accounting systems use typical databases (DBF, MS SQL, MS ACCESS etc.). In 2020 accounting software used 94% of pollees.

Looking back years ago, most organizations, even larger ones, hire outside consultants, either from the software publisher or consultants who understand the organization and who work to help select and implement the ideal configuration, taking all components into consideration.

The steps to implement an accounting information system are as follows:
;Detailed Requirements Analysis: where all individuals involved in the system are interviewed. The current system is thoroughly understood, including problems, and complete documentation of the system—transactions, reports, and questions that need to be answered—are gathered. User needs that are not in the current system are outlined and documented. Users include everyone, from top management to data entry. The requirements analysis not only provides the developer with the specific needs, it also helps users accept the change. Users who have the opportunity to ask questions and provide input are much more confident and receptive of the change, than those who sit back and do not express their concerns.
;Systems Design (synthesis): The analysis is thoroughly reviewed and a new system is created. The system that surrounds the system is often the most important. What data needs to go into the system and how is this going to be handled? What information needs to come out of the system how is it going to be formatted? If we know what needs to come out, we know what we need to put into the system. The program we select will need to appropriately handle the process. The system is built with control files, sample master records, and the ability to perform processes on a test basis. The system is designed to include appropriate internal controls and to provide management with the information needed to make decisions. It is a goal of an accounting information system to provide information that is relevant, meaningful, reliable, useful, and current. To achieve this, the system is designed so that transactions are entered as they occur (either manually or electronically) and information is immediately available online for management.

:Once the system is designed, an RFP is created detailing the requirements and fundamental design. Vendors are asked to respond to the proposal, to provide demonstrations of the product, and to specifically respond to the needs of the organization. Ideally, the vendor will input control files, sample master records, and be able to show how transactions are processed that result in the information that management needs to make decisions. An RFP for the information technology infrastructure follows the selection of the software product because the software product generally has specific requirements for infrastructure. Sometimes, the software and the infrastructure is selected from the same vendor. If not, the organization must ensure that vendors will work together without &quot;pointing fingers&quot; when there is an issue with either the software or the infrastructure.
;Documentation:As the system is being designed, it is documented. The documentation includes vendor documentation of the system and, more importantly, the procedures or detailed instructions that help users handle each process specific to the organization. Most documentation and procedures are online and it is helpful if organizations can add to the help instructions provided by the software vendor. Documentation and procedures tend to be an afterthought but is the insurance policy and the tool used during testing and training—before launch. The documentation is tested during the training so that when the system is launched, there is no question that it works and that the users are confident with the change.
;Testing: Before launch, all processes are tested from input through output, using the documentation as a tool to ensure that all processes are thoroughly documented and that users can easily follow the procedures: They know it works and that the procedures will be followed consistently. The reports are reviewed and verified, so that there&#x27;s no garbage in-garbage out. This is done in a test system not yet fully populated with live data. Most organizations launch systems before thorough testing, adding to end-user frustration when processes do not work. The documentation and procedures may be modified during this process. All identified transactions must be tested during this step. All reports and online information must be verified and traced through the audit trail so that management is ensured that transactions will be handled consistently and that the information can be relied upon to make decisions.
;Training: Before launch, all users need to be trained, with procedures. This means a trainer using the procedures to show each end user how to handle a procedures. The procedures often need to be updated during training as users describe their unique circumstances and the &quot;design&quot; is modified with this additional information. The end user then performs the procedure with the trainer and the documentation. The end user then performs the procedure with the documentation alone. The end user is then on his or her own with the support, either in person or by phone, of the trainer or other support person. This is before data conversion.
;Data Conversion: Tools are developed to convert the data from the current system (which was documented in the requirements analysis) to the new system. The data is mapped from one system to the other and data files are created that will work with the tools that are developed. The conversion is thoroughly tested and verified before final conversion. There&#x27;s a backup so it can be restarted, if necessary.
;Launch: The system is implemented only after all of the above is completed. The entire organization is aware of the launch date. Ideally, the current system is retained and often run in &quot;parallel&quot; until the new system is in full operation and working properly. With the current mass-market software used by thousands of companies and fundamentally proven to work, the &quot;parallel&quot; run that is mandatory with software tailor-made to a company is generally not done. This is only true, however, when the above process is followed, the system is thoroughly documented and tested, and users are trained before launch.

;Tools: Online resources are available to assist with strategic planning of accounting information systems. Information systems and financial forms aid in determining the specific needs of each organization, as well as assigning responsibility to principles involved.

;Support: The end users and managers have ongoing support available at all times. System upgrades follow a similar process and all users are thoroughly apprised of changes, upgraded in an efficient manner, and trained.

:Many organizations chose to limit the time and money spent on the analysis, design, documentation, and training, and move right into software selection and implementation. If a detailed requirements analysis is performed with adequate time being spent on the analysis, the implementation and ongoing support will be minimal. Organizations that skip the steps to ensure the system meets their needs are often left with frustrated end users, costly support, and information that is not current or correct. Worse yet, these organizations build the system three times instead of once.

==Evolution==
Accounting Information Systems are characterized by large amounts of different approaches and methodologies over the past 50 years. Due to the restrictions and weaknesses of previous models each new model evolved. Interestingly After the production of newest technique the newer or recent models of evolution does not eliminate or replace the older or previous technique instantly. However Several Generations and peers of systems exists among different institutions, organizations, groups at the same time and possibly exists with in a single or same institution. Similarly The up-to-date inspector needs to be aware with the functioning features of all AIS approaches that he or she is likely to encounter. currently there are four approaches can be identified which has been evolved during last 50 years.

;* Manual Process Model
;* Flat File Model
;* Database Model System
;* REA Model (Resource, Event and Agents)

==Career==

Many AIS professionals work for consulting firms, large corporations, insurance companies, financial firms, government agencies and public accounting firms, among other types of companies. With technological advancement, traditional accounting practice will shift to accounting information systems practice. Both accounting and information technology professional bodies are working on the new directions of accounting programs and industry practices. System Auditors is one of the top choices in the past two decades, they look at the controls, data processing, data integrity, general operation, maintenance, security and other aspects of all types of information systems used by businesses. Some job titles in this field of work include financial manager, financial examiner and chief financial officer. Other job titles include computer systems analyst, a computer information systems manager or a computer software engineer or programmer specializing in financial software.

There are industry associations offer certificates that related to AIS area include CISA, AIS, CISSP, CIA, AFE, CFE, and CITP.

<text>An annual report is a comprehensive report on a company&#x27;s activities throughout the preceding year. Annual reports are intended to give shareholders and other interested people information about the company&#x27;s activities and financial performance. They may be considered as grey literature. Most jurisdictions require companies to prepare and disclose annual reports, and many require the annual report to be filed at the company&#x27;s registry. Companies with issued shares publicly listed are also required to report at more frequent intervals (depending upon the rules of the stock exchange involved).

==Content==
Typical annual reports may include:

* General corporate information
* Operating and financial review
* Director&#x27;s Report
* Corporate governance information
* Chairpersons statement
* Auditor&#x27;s report
* Sustainability and ESG information
* Green annual report
* Contents: non-audited information
* Financial statements, including
** Balance sheet also known as Statement of Financial Position
** Income statement also known as profit and loss statement. 
** Statement of changes in equity
** Cash flow statement
* Notes to the financial statements
* Accounting policies
* Independent assurance statements
* Other features

Other information deemed relevant to stakeholders may be included, such as a report on operations for manufacturing firms or corporate social responsibility reports for companies with environmentally or socially sensitive operations. In the case of larger companies, it is usually a sleek, colorful, high-gloss publication.

The details provided in the report are of use to investors to understand the company&#x27;s financial position and future direction. The financial statements are usually compiled in compliance with IFRS and/or the domestic GAAP, as well as domestic legislation (e.g. the SOX in the U.S.).

In the United States, a more-detailed version of the report, called a Form 10-K, is submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A publicly held company may also issue a much more limited version of an annual report, which is known as a &quot;wrap report.&quot; A wrap report is a Form 10-K with an annual report cover wrapped around it.

===Directors&#x27; Role===

Statement of Directors&#x27; responsibilities for the shareholders&#x27; financial statements

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable Law of the Republic of Ireland, including the accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board and published by The Institute of Chartered Accountants. Irish company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:

* Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
* Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
* Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.

The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements. The directors are responsible for keeping proper books of account that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Ireland and with Irish statute comprising the Companies Acts 1963 to 2009...

=== Missed Report Penalty ===
Failing to submit an annual report within the designated deadline can result in serious legal and financial consequences for a company. For example, in Estonia, failing to meet this deadline can lead to penalties, including fines and, in more severe cases, the potential removal of the company from the register.

== History ==
In 1903, US Steel published an annual report whose financial accuracy was certified by Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co in what is known as the earliest modern corporate annual report.

== &#x27;Alternative&#x27; annual reports ==
Certain groups such as The True Cost Of Chevron Network have released &#x27;alternative&#x27; annual reports as a way to highlight ongoing environmental destruction and/or human rights abuses committed by a particular company.

<doc id="1272427" wikidata="Q63750" url="?curid=1272427" title="Alaminos, Laguna">
<text>Alaminos, officially the Municipality of Alaminos (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 51,619 people.

The Municipality of Alaminos is an agro-industrial town that lies within the third congressional district of the Province of Laguna and is part of the Calabarzon. Based on the municipal zoning, the industrial sites are located along Maharlika Highway of Barangays San Andres, San Juan, San Agustin and San Benito. Here, lands are available for industrial and commercial purposes. Barangays San Andres and San Juan will also be developed as a techno park for farm housing, industrial and commercial purposes.

==Etymology==
Alaminos got its name from Capitan-General Juan de Alaminos Nivera, the chief executive of Batangas in which the area the present-day municipality covers was once part of.

==History==
Alaminos began as a barrio of San Pablo, which was then only a town of the Province of Batangas. Its initial name was Trenchera, denoting the presence of long and deep ravines. The early inhabitants of Trenchera were believed to be insurrectionists, and possibly fugitives, who took advantage of the numerous trenches for hiding as well as for defense against the Spanish authority.

Sometime in 1873 when a certain Don Andres Penaloza was the Gobernadorcillo (equivalent to Mayor) of the town of San Pablo, Trenchera was formally separated and became a pueblo or town but remained part of the Batangas. Don Cirilo Baylon, a wealthy resident of Trenchera and with good command of the Spanish language, invited Captain-General Juan de Alaminos Nivera, the Chief Executive of the Batangas. The Captain-General accepted the invitation and came in a colorful carriage drawn by two horses. With Don Cirilo Baylon leading, he was warmly received by the residents of Trenchera. Dona Gregoria Baylon, the younger sister of Don Cirilo Baylon presented bouquets of fresh flowers to the Captain-General.

During the program in honor of the Captain-General and his party, Don Cirilo Baylon presented the petition of the residents asking that Trenchera be made into a duly organized and recognized town. The petition was read in public and the Captain General gave assurance to consider their wish favorably. In less than two months, the official paper proclaiming Trenchera as a new pueblo or town arrived from Lipa.

At the same time, Don Cirilo Baylon was appointed the first Gobernadorcillo or town mayor in concurrent capacity as Capitan de los Constables de Pueblo or the equivalent of the local police chief. In appreciation of the Capitan-General, the new pueblo was named Alaminos in 1873 and remained part of Batangas until 1903, when it was returned to San Pablo by virtue of Act No. 939. It was later reconstituted as an independent municipality in 1916.

==Geography==

<doc id="1272432" wikidata="Q1977520" url="?curid=1272432" title="General ledger">
<text>In bookkeeping, a general ledger is a bookkeeping ledger in which accounting data are posted from journals and aggregated from subledgers, such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, cash management, fixed assets, purchasing and projects. A general ledger may be maintained on paper, on a computer, or in the cloud. A ledger account is created for each account in the chart of accounts for an organization and is classified into account categories, such as income, expense, assets, liabilities, and equity; the collection of all these accounts is known as the general ledger. The general ledger holds financial and non-financial data for an organization. Each account in the general ledger consists of one or more pages. It includes details such as the date of sale, invoice number, customer details, and the amount due. This ledger helps businesses track outstanding receivables and manage cash flow efficiently. An organization&#x27;s statement of financial position and the income statement are both derived from income and expense account categories in the general ledger.

==Terminology ==
The general ledger contains a page for all accounts in the chart of accounts arranged by account categories. The general ledger is usually divided into at least seven main categories: assets, liabilities, owner&#x27;s equity, revenue, expenses, gains and losses. It is the system of record for an organization’s financial transactions.
The main categories of the general ledger may be further subdivided into subledgers to include additional details of such accounts as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, etc.

The extraction of account balances is called a trial balance. The purpose of the trial balance is, at a preliminary stage of the financial statement preparation process, to ensure the equality of the total debits and credits.

==Process==
Posting is the process of recording amounts as credits (right side), and amounts as debits (left side), in the pages of the general ledger. Additional columns to the right hold a running activity total (similar to a chequebook).

The general ledger should include the date, description and balance or total amount for each account.

Because each bookkeeping entry debits one account and credits another account in an equal amount, the double-entry bookkeeping system helps ensure that the general ledger is always in balance, thus maintaining the accounting equation:

The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the balance sheet. Although a general ledger appears to be fairly simple, in large or complex organizations or organizations with various subsidiaries, the general ledger can grow to be quite large and take several hours or days to audit or balance. 
In a manual or non-computerized system, the general ledger may be a large book. Organizations may instead employ one or more spreadsheets for their ledgers, including the general ledger, or may utilize specialized software to automate ledger entry and handling. When a business uses enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, a financial-features module produces subledgers and the general ledger, with entries drawn from a database that is shared with other processes managed through the ERP.

<text>Marantz is a company that develops and sells high-end audio products. The company was founded in New York, but is now based in California.

<text>Cisalpinism (derived from &quot;this side of the Alps&quot;) was a movement among English Roman Catholics in the late eighteenth century intended to further the cause of Catholic emancipation, i.e. relief from many of the restrictions still in effect that were placed on Roman Catholic British subjects. This view held that allegiance to the Crown was not incompatible with allegiance to the Pope.

==Background==
With the deterioration of relations with the American colonies, the British government was faced with the necessity of increasing troop recruitments. While Catholic Relief Act of 1778 eased some provisions of the Penal Laws, its main purpose was to encourage the Catholic gentry to support enlistments. According to historian Thomas Bartlett, &quot;It firmly established the principle of Catholic relief as a key element of war-time strategy.&quot; The passing of this act was the occasion of the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots (1780).

==Catholic Committee==
===First English Catholic Committee===
Cisalpinism was more a political than theological position, directed toward helping the question of emancipation. 
It sought accommodation of the English Roman Catholic Church within the Protestant State in the 18th century, when the Penal Laws persecuting the Catholic Church were still in place. Thirty Catholic laymen met in 1782 to elect a &quot;Catholic Committee&quot; of five, for a period of five years, &quot;to promote and attend to the affairs of the Roman Catholic body in England&quot;. According to the Secretary to the Committee, Charles Butler, &quot;A variety of circumstances prevented them making any particular exertions in the cause entrusted to them.&quot;

The Committee first action was to write to the four Apostolic Vicars that one of the causes raised against further repeal of the penal laws was the title &quot;apostolic vicar&quot; and the perception of too close a dependence on the &quot;Court of Rome&quot;. The Committee proposed the restoration of the hierarchy with the apostolic vicars becoming Bishops in Ordinary, governing their own dioceses. From the perspective of the actual working of ecclesiastical affairs, each of the Apostolic Vicars had a different opinion; and the matter was dropped.

===Second English Catholic Committee===
The powers of the first committee having expired at the end of its term in 1787, a new committee was constituted made up of ten members. In February, the Committee sent a letter to the Prime Minister protesting various prohibitions for which they suffered severe penalties. Among those listed were:
* keeping schools for educating their children in their own religious principles at home;
* sending their children abroad for education;
* practicing law;
* serving in the House of Commons;
* taking their hereditary seat in House of Lords;

and as loyal subjects, they petitioned for redress of their grievances.

In May 1788, the following year, the following members were added: James Talbot, vicar apostolic of the London district (although he never attended a meeting); Charles Berington, co-adjutor of the Midland district; and Joseph Wilks, a Benedictine monk.

Although it looked like a way to safeguard the English Catholic population, Bishop Charles Walmesley (1722–1797), the Vicar Apostolic of the west of England, thought Cisalpinism would mean a new oath of allegiance that would &quot;exclude the Pope&#x27;s spiritual jurisdiction&quot; and &quot;diminish our dependence in spirituals on the Church in Rome, and by degrees to shake it off entirely; likewise to take off the abstinence of Saturday, to reduce Lent to a fortnight before Easter, and to have the Liturgy in English&quot;.

The publication of the &quot;Staffordshire Creed&quot; by some Staffordshire clergy to Bishop Walmesley complained about the excommunication of the Benedictine Joseph Wilks. The creed also contained the Rights of the Priesthood against the Episcopacy, and this at a time when many Catholic laity were still being accused of treason.

In 1797 Bishop Walmesley publicly excommunicated the signatories of the &quot;Staffordshire Creed&quot;. One of the defenders of the Cisalpine tradition who even objected to the Asperges (sprinkling of Holy Water) before Mass was John Lingard, author of the hymn &quot;Hail Queen of Heaven the Ocean Star&quot; and first Rector of Ushaw College seminary. Father Daniel Rock, chaplain to Lord Shrewsbury of Alton Towers from 1827 to 1841, continued for a short time elements of the Cisalpine tradition. It was the chance meeting at Alton Towers of Lord Shrewsbury with Father F. W. Faber that promoted Ultramontanism.

<text>The Shukhov Radio Tower (), also known as the Shabolovka Tower (), is a broadcasting tower deriving from the Russian avant-garde in Moscow designed by Vladimir Shukhov. The free-standing steel diagrid structure was built between 1920 and 1922, during the Russian Civil War.

==History==
===Design===
Vladimir Shukhov invented the world&#x27;s first hyperboloid structure in the year 1890. Later he wrote a book, &quot;Rafters&quot;, in which he proved that the triangular shapes are 20-25% heavier than the arched ones with a ray grating. After that, Shukhov filed a number of patents for a diagrid. He aimed not only to achieve greater strength and rigidity of the structure, but also ease and simplicity through the use of as little building material as possible.

The first diagrid tower was built for the All-Russia Exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896, and later was bought by Yury Nechaev-Maltsov, a well-known manufacturer in the city. Shukhov was responsible for constructions of a new types of lighthouses, masts, water towers and transmission towers.

The broadcasting tower at Shabolovka is a diagrid structure in the form of a rotated hyperboloid. The Khodynka radio station, built in 1914, could no longer handle the increasing amount of radiograms. On July 30, 1919, Vladimir Lenin signed a decree of the Council of Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Defense, which demanded &quot;to install in an extremely urgent manner a radio station equipped with the most advanced and powerful devices and machines&quot;, to ensure the security of the country and allow constant communication with other republics. Tower designing was started immediately across many bureaus. Later that year Shukhov&#x27;s Construction Office won a competition.

The planned height of the new nine-sectioned hyperbolic tower was ( taller than the Eiffel Tower, which was taken into consideration when creating the plan) with an estimated mass of 2,200 tons (the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons). However, in the context of the Civil War and the lack of resources, the project had to be revised: the height was reduced to , the weight to 240 tons.

===Installation===
Tower construction was carried out without any cranes and scaffolding, but only with winches. 240 tons of metal that was required for construction, was allocated by Lenin’s personal decree from the stocks of the Military Department. For lifting five wooden winches were used, which were moved to the upper sections.

The tower is composed of six sections, one above the other. Each section is an independent hyperboloid based on a larger one.

The sixth section was installed and finally secured on February 14, 1922.

==Structure==
The Shukhov tower is a hyperboloid structure (hyperbolic steel gridshell) consisting of a series of hyperboloid sections stacked on one another to approximate an overall conical shape. The tower has a diagrid structure, and its steel shell experiences minimum wind load (a significant design factor for high-rising buildings). The tower sections are single-cavity hyperboloids of rotation made of straight beams, the ends of which rest against circular foundations.

==Location==
The tower is located a few kilometres south of the Moscow Kremlin, but is not accessible to tourists. The street address of the tower is &quot;Shabolovka Street, 37&quot;.

==Possible demolition==
As of early 2014, the tower faced demolition by the Russian State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting, after having been allowed to deteriorate for years despite popular calls for its restoration. Following a concerted campaign calling for the preservation of the tower, on July 3 the Ministry of Culture of Russia announced that the tower will not be demolished, and in September 2014 that Moscow City Council had placed a preservation order on the tower in order to safeguard it. 

In January 2017 the RTRS placed a request for tender for a plan to renovate and preserve the monument.

==Models==
There is a model of Shukhov&#x27;s Shabolovka Tower at the Information Age gallery at the Science Museum in London. The model is at 1:30 scale and was installed in October 2014.

==In popular culture==
* In 1922 one of the members of ASNOVA Vladimir Krinsky made a &quot;Radio speaker of the Revolution&quot; mural with a picture of a tower.
* A science fiction novel by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy The Garin Death Ray was inspired by the public reaction towards construction of the tower.

<doc id="1272442" wikidata="Q200596" url="?curid=1272442" title="Towednack">
<text>Towednack () is a churchtown and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The parish is bounded by those of Zennor in the west, Gulval in the south, Ludgvan in the west and south, and St Ives and the Atlantic Ocean in the north and east. The church is about two miles (3 km) from St Ives and six miles (10 km) from Penzance.

Towednack lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park.

==History==
===Towednack gold hoard===
In December 1931 a hoard of gold ornaments was found in the parish. A sunken lane, known locally as Badger&#x27;s Lane, leads down from Lady Downs onto the road to Amalveor. Here at SW4794 3759, concealed in an ancient stone hedge, was found a collection of beautiful gold objects, including two twisted neckrings, four armrings and two lengths of unfinished gold rod. One necklet consists of a single twisted strand of gold, and the other consists of three strands loosely twisted together. The gold is very fine, and probably came from Ireland. These ornaments date from the late Bronze Age and they now reside in the British Museum. A replica of the hoard can be seen at the Penlee House Museum in Penzance. In 2007 there were calls in the local Cornish press for the gold hoard to be returned to Cornwall from the British Museum.

===Parish church===
The church is dedicated to St Tewennocus and did not become parochial until 1902. It was built in the 13th century and has a plain tower. A south aisle was added in the 15th century. The font is of granite, 1720, and stands on a base which is an inverted Norman font. Towednack church is claimed to be the last church in which services were conducted in the Cornish language (in 1678), though the claim is also made for Ludgvan. The parish saint disguised under the name &#x27;Tewennocus&#x27; is almost certainly St Winwalo (pet-form: Winnoc), also commemorated at Gunwalloe and Landewednack, as well as Landevennec, Brittany: the place-name being derived from Old Cornish &quot;te-Winnoc&quot; (thy St Winnoc [Winwalo]), now represented as Late Cornish Te Wydnek. The aisle, chancel and nave was restored under the direction of Mr Sedding in 1870 and in 1880 the tower and its roof restored. The cost of the 1880 building work was paid for by money from the weekly offertory. &quot;The Cornishman&quot; newspaper described the parish thus,

The parish is poor; the people are only a few hundreds; many (probably most) of them are Dissenters who never enter a Church; and the Church itself is small; and yet the offertory has been the means of doing more than Church-rates ever did. When the two broken bells are re-cast (will any rich man do this for poor Towednack?) this parish will process the most thoroughly restored Church in West Cornwall.

One of the bells has the inscription ″Baragwanath″ (wheat bread), a name which was still common in this part of Cornwall at the time of the visit of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, in September 1882. They noted, ″a true chancel-arch″, which was described as the church&#x27;s ″peculiar and rare feature″. Also seen was the benchends and their medallion-portraits of the 1633 bearded and hatted churchwardens. Their inscriptions are ″James Trewhela, warden″ and ″Master Matthew Trenwith, warden″.

Further restoration work was carried out in 1884 with the replacement of the wooden floor of the nave, which was destroyed by dry rot. The new floor was cement, covered with a wooden platform between the benches and red tiles replaced the ″rough″ slate floor of the aisle.

Until 1902 Towednack was a chapelry of Lelant; right of sepulture was only obtained in 1532. The early incised cross on a stone in the porch and the altar slab suggest that the subordination to Lelant only began after the Norman Conquest. The stone in the porch forms a bench; the cross shaft has crosses at both ends. Over the porch is a typical sundial of a wide class of Cornish church dials from 1720. The inscription reads ″&quot;Bright Sol and Luna Time and Tide doth hold. Chronodix Humbrale&quot;″.

There was a Cornish cross at Tredorwin; it was found in use as a building stone in a cottage at Coldharbour in 1880. It is now in the churchyard (&quot;illustrated right&quot;).

The Gorsedh Kernow was held in the parish in 1933, and the church was the first to hold a service, in Cornish, in modern times.

===Mining===
In the early part of the 19th-century Towednack was one of the richest tin-producing districts in west Cornwall. Mines included Wheal Reeth, Wheal Margaret, Reeth Consols and Georgia, and Conquer Downs.

===Notable people===
* John Quick (1852–1932) – Australian lawyer, politician and judge.

==Local government==
For the purposes of local government Towednack is a civil parish electing a parish council every four years. The principal local authority in this area is Cornwall Council.

==Folklore==
A story told by the Rev. W. S. Lach-Szyrma, to a group of antiquarians from the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, was the legend of the tower: 
* &quot;... the tower was never completed as during the night the &#x27;Evil One&#x27; would knock down what the men had built the previous day. This went on for some time until the men gave up and the tower remains as it is today (1882).&quot; Similar legends also refer to nearby Lelant church and Brent Tor on Dartmoor.

In 1975 the church was the scene for the marriage and burial services in &quot;Poldark&quot;, a BBC series based on the novels of Winston Graham.
It was also used as a location in the 1979 BBC series &quot;Penmarric&quot;.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) is the world&#x27;s first professional body of Chartered Accountants (CAs).{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

ICAS act as a voice of the professional business community. Although other British accounting bodies use the title Chartered Accountant, the CA designation is unique to ICAS in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

ICAS has more than 21,000 members and students worldwide. ICAS members are business advisors, business owners and entrepreneurs. They play roles in 80% of the FTSE 100 companies. Half of ICAS members are based in Scotland; the other half work in England and around the globe.

== History ==
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) is the world&#x27;s first professional body of accountants, receiving its Royal Charter in 1854. The institute originated from:

# The Institute of Accountants in Edinburgh, was formed in 1853;
# The Institute of Accountants and Actuaries in Glasgow, was formed in 1853;
# The Aberdeen Society of Accountants, formed in 1867.

These three bodies merged to form the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in 1951. It was the first to adopt the designation &quot;Chartered Accountant&quot; and the designatory letters &quot;CA&quot; are still an exclusive privilege in the UK for ICAS members.

Anton Colella was the chief executive of the ICAS for about ten years, until retiring in 2018.

== Membership and Qualification ==
* ICAS has over 24,000 members worldwide who worked in public practice, industry, commerce, the public sector and education. Membership is generally obtained by entering a training contract with an accountancy firm (although it is possible to train within the industry), during which the student gains experience and sits a number of exams. The CA designation is reserved exclusively for their use in the UK. ICAS is the only UK chartered accountancy body that provides professional education and training, as well as examinations, for all its students.
* Since the mid-1990s, ICAS has trained students located in England &amp; Wales, and in that respect competes with ICAEW.
In addition to the CA qualification, ICAS delivers the ICAS Tax Professional (ITP) qualification in partnership with Tolley Tax Training. Those completing the qualification are awarded the designiation &#x27;ITP&#x27;.

==Admission to membership==

It generally takes 3 years to qualify as a CA during which students will combine structured work experience with classroom-based study of relevant education syllabus. The training programme enables students to develop the professional knowledge, skills and attributes essential to qualify as a CA.

In order to be eligible to enter training to become a chartered accountant, prospective CA students must hold a UK degree (or overseas equivalent). The UK NARIC provides a service to individuals seeking confirmation on comparability between international qualifications and UK qualifications. In addition prospective CA students must obtain a training contract with an authorised employer.

==Mutual recognition==
The institute has mutual recognition agreements in place with:

* Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
* Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland
* Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants
* Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia
* New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants
* South African Institute of Chartered Accountants
* Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants
* American Institute of Certified Public Accountants

ICAS members may be admitted to full memberships of the above institutions after passing an aptitude test or subject to other specific requirements.

Members of equivalent bodies in other European Economic Area member states and Switzerland may also be admitted to membership after passing an aptitude test, provided they are citizens of an EEA state or Switzerland.

A mutual recognition arrangement between the Institute and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) was put in place in 1996, but was terminated by ICAS in 2005.

== Role of ICAS ==
Under the Royal Charter, ICAS works in the public interest. The objective of ICAS is to uphold the integrity and standing of the profession of chartered accountancy in the interests of society and the membership, through excellence in education and the development of accountancy and through service to members and the enforcement of professional standards.

ICAS is a Designated Professional Body under the Financial Services and Markets Act, licensing firms of CAs to conduct a range of incidental investment business activities. It is a Recognised Professional Body under the Insolvency Act that issues permits to individual CAs to conduct insolvency appointments. ICAS is also a Recognised Qualifying Body and Recognised Supervisory Body in relation to company auditing under the Companies Act 1989.

ICAS is able to authorise members to conduct audit, insolvency and investment business work in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Luxembourg. This right is held in common with ACCA, ICAEW and the ICAI.

ICAS is a member of The Global Accounting Alliance (GAA) – an alliance of the world&#x27;s leading professional accountancy bodies, which was formed in 2005. The GAA is intended to promote quality services, share information and collaborate on important international issues. It works with national regulators, governments and stakeholders, through member-body collaboration, articulation of consensus views, and working in collaboration, where possible with other international bodies, especially IFAC.

ICAS is a founding member of Chartered Accountants Worldwide (CAW), an initiative by the leading chartered institutes to support, develop and promote the vital role that chartered accountants play throughout the global economy. It creates a community of hundreds of thousands of chartered accountants and students who share a commitment to the highest standards of professional and ethical practice.

==Disciplinary process==
ICAS was hesitant to join the Accountancy &amp; Actuarial Discipline Board when it was first set up (as the AIDB), but joined after approval by a special general meeting in October 2004.

The AADB only hears matters considered to be in the public interest. The institute conducts its own hearings into less substantial allegations. These used to be held in private, but ICAS resolved at a further special meeting in 2009 to follow the example of other bodies such as ICAEW to make the hearings public.

<text>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) is a professional membership organisation that promotes, develops and supports chartered accountants and students around the world. As of December 2023, it has over 208,000 members and students in 146 countries. ICAEW was established by royal charter in 1880.

==Overview==
The institute is a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB), formed in 1974 by the major accountancy professional bodies in the UK and Ireland. The fragmented nature of the accountancy profession in the UK is in part due to the absence of any legal requirement for an accountant to be a member of one of the many Institutes, as the term &quot;accountant&quot; does not have legal protection. However, a person must belong to ICAEW, ICAS or CAI to hold themselves out as a &quot;chartered accountant&quot; in the UK (although there are other chartered bodies of British qualified accountants whose members are likewise authorised to conduct restricted work such as auditing).

The institute is also a founder member of Chartered Accountants Worldwide (CAW), an international network of accountancy bodies which represents over 1.8 million members and students in more than 190 countries.

ICAEW has two offices in the United Kingdom; at their headquarters, Chartered Accountants&#x27; Hall in Moorgate, London and in Central Milton Keynes at the complex. It also has offices in Belgium (Europe Region), China (Beijing, Shanghai), Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates (Middle East, Africa and South East Asia Region).

==History==
Until the mid-nineteenth century, the role of accountants in England and Wales was restricted to that of bookkeepers, in that accountants merely maintained records of what other business people had purchased and sold. However, with the growth of the limited liability company and large scale manufacturing and logistic in Victorian Britain, a demand was created for more technically proficient accountants to deal with the increasing complexity of accounting transactions dealing with depreciation of assets, inventory valuation and the Companies legislation being introduced.

To improve their status and combat criticism of low standards, accountants in the cities of Britain formed professional bodies. ICAEW was formed from the five of these associations that existed in England prior to its establishment by royal charter in May 1880.

# The Incorporated Society of Liverpool Accountants, formed in January 1870;
# The Institute of Accountants in London was formed in November 1870, comprising 37 members under the leadership of William Quilter. In 1871, standards for membership were established with new members having to show knowledge and aptitude through successfully passing an oral examination. Initially the London Institute restricted its membership to that city, but as other institutes were established elsewhere (for example, in Manchester and Sheffield) it was decided to remove this restriction and as such in 1872 it simply became known as the Institute of Accountants to reflect its new national coverage;
# The Manchester Institute of Accountants, formed in February 1871;
# The Society of Accountants in England (1872);
# The Sheffield Institute of Accountants (1877).

In 1920, following the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, the organisation admitted Mary Harris Smith, who became the first woman chartered accountant in the world.

The headquarters of the institute, Chartered Accountants&#x27; Hall, in the City of London, which was designed in the Italian Renaissance style by John Belcher and built by Colls &amp; Sons, was completed in 1892. It is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of Victorian Baroque architecture. Sir William Whitfield designed the 1964–70 extension and new entrance.

In 1948, the institute received a Supplemental Charter. In 1957, ICAEW merged with the Society of Incorporated Accountants (founded in 1885 as the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors).

In 2019, as part of their celebration of 100 years of women being able to work as Chartered Accountants, ICAEW published a booklet on 100 years of women in Chartered Accountancy and launched a campaign to collect the stories of women members in chartered accountancy. In 2020, ICAEW announced the commissioning of a blue plaque to honour their first female member Mary Harris Smith.

==Membership and qualifications==
In order to become an ICAEW Chartered Accountant, it is necessary to achieve the ACA qualification.

===ACA qualification===
The ACA comprises four core elements that must be successfully completed. These are; professional development; ethics and professional scepticism; accountancy, finance and business modules; and practical work experience.

Professional development prepares students to successfully handle a variety of different situations they encounter throughout their career, improving their ability and performance in areas such as communication, decision-making, problem-solving and technical competence.

Ethics is embedded throughout the ACA qualification, developing students’ ethical capabilities to make suitable decisions, This is through an online programme based on the ICAEW Code of Ethics, the integration of ethical issues into all ACA exams and the practical application of ethical skills and behaviours within students’ work experience.

Practical work experience is undertaken as part of a training agreement with an authorised training employer or principal. Students must complete 450 days, which normally takes between three and five years. Experience can be completed in at least one of six categories: accounting; audit and assurance; financial management; information technology; insolvency; taxation.

===ACA exams===
There are 15 exams which are all computer based, spread across the Certificate level, the Professional level, and the Advanced level. Certificate level exams can be sat throughout the year at either dedicated test centres or at the candidate&#x27;s own location via remote invigilation. Results of the Certificate level exams are provided to candidates within 24 hours of sitting the exams. The Professional and Advanced level exams are long-form scenario and case based exams, consisting of 2.5-4 hour examinations. Results of Professional and Advanced level exams are provided to candidates some several weeks after sitting the exams, and are published online, although candidates can choose to remain anonymous and have their name excluded from publishing. All of the Certificate level exams are closed book.
The Professional level exams are a mixture of fully open book, fully closed book, or permitting approved texts (such as IFRS publications or tax tables). All of the Advanced level exams are fully open book, with two of the exams having advanced information.

===ACA exam prizes===
ICAEW awards prizes to high-scoring candidates in the ACA exams, including the Certificate level. There are subject-specific prizes for the best performance in a particular exam, and annual prizes for the highest marks across all the exams for a particular level. The subject-specific prizes can be awarded multiple times per year, reflecting the multiple sittings of exams each year; for the Professional level, there are 3-4 sittings per year for each exam, whilst for the Advanced level, there are 2 sittings per year for each exam. Prizes can be awarded jointly to multiple candidates.

===Other ways to membership and affiliations===

Some members of professional accountancy bodies within the European Union are eligible to apply for ICAEW membership under either the Statutory Audit Directive or the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (RPQ) Directive.

In 2010, ICAEW introduced its &quot;Pathways to Membership&quot; programme, which allows fully qualified members from certain professional bodies to apply for membership based on their experience.

There are also various other routes to membership, including reciprocal arrangements, advanced credit arrangements and common content arrangements with other professional accountancy bodies around the world.

=== Membership categories ===
Members have the designation ACA (Associate Chartered Accountant) or FCA (Fellow Chartered Accountant) after their name.

Fellowship is intended to designate those who have achieved a higher level of professional experience. It is awarded on application, and at no additional cost, to those members who have attained at least ten years of membership and who, at the date of application, have complied with the institute&#x27;s requirements on continuing professional development in the preceding three years and have no outstanding disciplinary charges against them.

== Regulation and discipline ==
As an improvement regulator, ICAEW works to protect the public by making sure ICAEW Chartered Accountants, firms that are regulated by ICAEW and students studying with ICAEW maintain the highest standards of professional competency and conduct. An improvement regulator works to educate as well as monitor the quality of its firms and members’ work and enforce change (change can include restrictions, penalties, exclusion from membership or from working in a regulated area) when needed. To ensure impartiality, the regulatory and disciplinary roles of ICAEW are carried out by a separate department, the Professional Standards Department. All of this work is overseen by several layers of independent governance; an independent board, the (IRB) and regulatory and disciplinary committees (at least half of each board must be lay members (non-accountants)) and oversight bodies including the Financial Reporting Council and the Insolvency Service.

==Faculties==
ICAEW has seven faculties, each run by an in-house team working together with members who are experts in their particular sector:

# Audit and Assurance
# Corporate Finance
# Corporate Reporting
# Financial Services: Banking
# Financial Services: Insurance
# Financial Services: Investment Management
# Tax

The Tax Faculty was the first to be formed in 1990. The monthly TAXline publication started in 1991, and an annual Technical
Review (now Tax Planning) was first published in October 1992. The Tax Faculty joined the Confédération Fiscale Européenne (CFE) in 2001.

==District Societies==

ICAEW has 25 local member networks and societies across the UK and the Crown Dependencies. These local networks and societies play a crucial role in supporting ICAEW members in their respective local areas providing:
* Support and engagement with a range of activities and events to help members stay up to date with industry trends and regulations
* Engagement with local economies, including actively engaging with key local stakeholders such as businesses, local policy makers and other professional organisations
* Professional networking providing opportunities for career development, knowledge sharing, and building professional relationships
* Knowledge sharing to help members stay informed about industry developments and best practices
* Advocacy - represent the interests of ICAEW and its members who are working in the business community at the local level.
Local networks help members connect, learn, and contribute to their local economies while upholding the reputation of the chartered accountant qualification.

==Student Societies==
There are 26 UK Students’ societies, some of which have existed for over 100 years, as well as international student networks. Further information can be found here.

The work of the student societies is key to encouraging the active engagement of ACA students with ICAEW at a local level. More specifically, this is achieved by:
* Advancing members’ education continuously.
* Acting as a channel of communication between students, ICAEW, the Student Council, and any other relevant bodies.
* Providing opportunities for networking, which enable students to develop intellectually, socially and professionally.
The student societies run a range of programmes and activity over the course of a year all of which complement the students’ ACA studies.

Events and activities are varied and typically cover revision sessions, career development seminars and a range of networking events such as annual dinners and quiz nights.

The ICAEW Student Council (ISC) is the representative body for student societies, bringing together representatives from each of the student societies to provide a voice and a feedback mechanism for the students.

<text>In physics and materials science, a drop tower or drop tube is a structure used to produce a controlled period of weightlessness for an object under study. Air bags, polystyrene pellets, and magnetic or mechanical brakes are sometimes used to arrest the fall of the experimental payload. In other cases, high-speed impact with a substrate at the bottom of the tower is an intentional part of the experimental protocol.

Not all such facilities are towers: NASA Glenn&#x27;s Zero Gravity Research Facility is based on a vertical shaft, extending to below ground level.

==Typical operation==
For a typical materials science experiment, a sample of the material under study is loaded into the top of the drop tube, which is filled with inert gas or evacuated to create a low-pressure environment. Following any desired preprocessing (e.g. induction heating to melt a metal alloy), the sample is released to fall to the bottom of the tube. During its flight or upon impact the sample can be characterized with instruments such as cameras and pyrometers.

Drop towers are also commonly used in combustion research. For this work, oxygen must be present and the payload may be enclosed in a drag shield to isolate it from high-speed &quot;wind&quot; as the apparatus accelerates toward the bottom of the tower. See a video of a microgravity combustion experiment in the NASA Glenn Five Second Drop Facility at .

Fluid physics experiments and development and testing of space-based hardware can also be conducted using a drop tower. Sometimes, the ground-based research performed with a drop tower serves as a prelude to more ambitious, in-flight investigation; much longer periods of weightlessness can be achieved with parabolic-flight-path aircraft or with space-based laboratories aboard the Space Shuttle or the International Space Station.

The duration of free-fall produced in a drop tube depends on the length of the tube and its degree of internal evacuation. The 105-meter drop tube at Marshall Space Flight Center produces 4.6 seconds of weightlessness when it is fully evacuated. In the drop facility Fallturm Bremen at University of Bremen a catapult can be used to throw the experiment upwards to prolong the weightlessness from 4.74 to nearly 9.3 seconds. Negating the physical space needed for the initial acceleration, this technique doubles the effective period of weightlessness. The NASA Glenn Research Center has a 5 second drop tower (The Zero Gravity Facility) and a 2.2 second drop tower (The 2.2 Second Drop Tower).

Much of the operating cost of a drop tower is due to the need for evacuation of the drop tube, to eliminate the effect of aerodynamic drag. Alternatively the experiment is placed inside an outer box (the drag shield) for which, due to its weight, during its fall the reduction of acceleration due to air drag is less.

==Historical uses==
Though the story may be apocryphal, Galileo is popularly thought to have used the Leaning Tower of Pisa as a drop tower to demonstrate that falling bodies accelerate at the same constant rate regardless of their mass.

Drop towers called shot towers were once useful for making lead shot. A short period of weightlessness allows molten lead to solidify into a quasi-perfect sphere by the time it reaches the floor of the tower.

<doc id="1272468" wikidata="Q268141" url="?curid=1272468" title="Rose of Viterbo">
<text>Rose of Viterbo, TOSF (; c. 1233 – 6 March 1251), was a young woman born in Viterbo, then a contested commune of the Papal States. She spent her brief life as a recluse, and was outspoken in her support of the papacy. Otherwise leading an unremarkable life, she later became known for her mystical gifts of prophecy and having miraculous powers. She is honoured as a saint by the Catholic Church.

== Life ==
The chronology of her life remains uncertain, as the acts of her canonization, the chief historical sources, record no dates. Most scholars agree she was probably born around the year 1233.

Born of poor and pious parents, even as a child, Rose had a great desire to pray and to aid the poor. She prayed much for the conversion of sinners. Rose was not yet 10 years old when the Blessed Virgin Mary is said to have instructed her to take the habit of the Third Order of St. Francis and to preach penance in Viterbo, at that time under the rule of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.

She lived a life of prayer, penance and solitude in her father&#x27;s home. Every now and then she would emerge from her solitude to entreat the people to do penance. Her mission seems to have lasted for about two years. In January 1250, Viterbo, her native city, was then in revolt against the pope. When she was 12, she began preaching a message in the streets allied with Guelph aspirations, thus against Emperor Frederick&#x27;s rule over Viterbo. She and her family were exiled from the city and took refuge in Soriano nel Cimino. By 1250-1251, when pope Innocent IV&#x27;s faction regained power in Viterbo, Rose was allowed to return.

On December 5, 1250, Rose allegedly foretold the speedy death of the emperor, a prophecy fulfilled on December 13. Soon afterwards she went to Vitorchiano, whose inhabitants, according to surviving reports, were affected by a supposed sorceress. Rose secured the conversion of all, even of the sorceress, reportedly by standing unscathed for three hours in the flames of a burning pyre.

Rose wished to enter the Poor Clares of St Mary in the city, but was refused because of her poverty, as she was not able to provide the dowry required for admission. She accepted her rejection, nonetheless foretelling her admission to the monastery after her death.

Rose died on March 6, 1251, in her father&#x27;s home. It was long believed that Rose had died of tuberculosis. In 2010, however, researchers examining her remains concluded that she had died of complications due to Pentalogy of Cantrell.

== Veneration ==

The process of Rose&#x27;s canonization was opened in the year of her death by Pope Innocent IV, but was not definitively undertaken until 1457. Originally buried in the small parish church of Santa Maria in Poggio located in Piazza della Crocetta in central Viterbo; in 1257 Pope Alexander IV ordered it moved to the monastery she had desired to enter, located a few hundred meters away from her original burial, at which time it was renamed in her honor.

When the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church was reformed after the Second Vatican Council, her feast day was transferred to the date of her death. September 4 is the date of the translation of her relics to the Monastery of St. Damian. It is this latter date on which her feast is celebrated in Viterbo and by the Franciscans.

On September 3, the eve of the feast of St. Rose, the people of Viterbo follow the transportation of &quot;La Macchina&quot; (&quot;the Machine of St. Rose&quot;) a massive tower, illuminated with 3,000 tiny electric lights and 880 candles, and topped off with a statue of her, which is carried for 1,200 metres through the darkened streets of the old medieval town on the backs of around 100 volunteers called &quot;facchini&quot;. The tradition goes all the way back to September 4, 1258, when the body of the saint was exhumed and transported to the Monastery of Saint Damian; but it was not until 1664, following seven years of plague in the city, that a &quot;machine&quot; first appeared. In gratitude for having survived such a terrible pestilence the citizens voted to renew the veneration of their saint every year.

St. Rose of Viterbo Convent, named for her, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, is the motherhouse of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration. The convent is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Viterbo University is a Catholic, Franciscan university in the liberal arts tradition, founded by these Franciscan Sisters, also located in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

Rose of Viterbo is one of the religious figures featured in the award-winning series of saint plays by Erik Ehn. The play celebrating her life premiered in October 2008 at Goshen College.

<doc id="1272479" wikidata="Q3629880" url="?curid=1272479" title="Dandiya Raas">
<text>Raas or Dandiya Raas is the socio-religious folk dance originating from Indian state of Gujarat and popularly performed in the festival of Navaratri. The dance is performed in the Marwar region of Rajasthan too. The etymology of Dandiya-Raas is in Sanskrit. Dandiya-raas exists in the different forms, including the collegiate competitive form. The dance style is now in a competitive format and a traditional format.

Men and women traditionally play &quot;dandiya-raas&quot; and the dance operates in pairs, meaning the group must contain an even number. Generally, two lines are formed, with partners facing each other:The lines move clockwise, and each person steps forward to hit sticks with their partner, then moves on two people. At the end of the line, each turns and joins the line opposite, so the movement is continuous. The music starts very slowly […] It is an eight-beat time cycle called Kaherva and performed in the following manner: on the first beat, your own sticks are hit together, followed by right sticks with your partner, then left sticks (or the same stick if using one). Each one then turns away to the left to hit their own sticks together before turning back to the partner to hit the right sticks again, and before moving on two places to a new partner.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;Raas&quot; comes from the Sanskrit word &quot;Rasa&quot;, an aesthetic Indian concept related to emotions and feelings. Kapila Vatsyayan argued that the aesthetic theory of the Rasa gives the underlying unity to the Indian arts.

==Forms==
Dandiya Raas, Gopgunthan Solanga Raas and Mer Dandiya Raas are the popular forms of Raas. In Saurashtra, Raas is performed by the men and the dance performed by women is called as Raasda. Element of dance is more prominent in the Raas while music is more prominent in Raasda.

=== Collegiate Garba-Raas ===

Garba-Raas, more commonly known as Raas, is a combination dance style consisting of mainly Dandiya-Raas and some Garba. Garba-Raas emerged as a competitive dance style due to the efforts of the Federation of Gujarati Associations of North America (FOGNA). The Garba-Raas competitive dance style was further developed in the early 2000s by first generation Indian-American college students. Furthermore, a cohesive national organization for Garba-Raas was established in 2009 called Raas All-stars (RAS). As of 2023, the organization consists of almost 50 actively competing collegiate Garba-Raas teams nationwide, out of a total of 66 recorded teams.

=== Competitive Garba-Raas ===
Garba-Raas is traditionally a recreational social dance form that is done in large groups. The competitive form is described as “...competitive sport, rather than an inclusive, ritualistic dance form, the need to &quot;entertain&quot; has become increasingly paramount” by Falcone. In order to turn this social dance into a competitive activity, many aspects of the dance, such as the formations, the moves, and structures, have changed. The new evolved style is described in further detail below under “ The Garba-Raas Competitive Dance Style”.

Similarities between the traditional and competitive styles are the clothing, the music, and the basic moves. Jessica Falcone points out that dancers prefer to identify the new dance style as a branch of Garba and Dandiya-raas but in reality, she states that intercollegiate Garba-Raas is transforming into its own dance style.
The structure competition dance consists of 12-16 dancers who perform 8-9 continuous dances which are a combination of Garba, dandiya-raas, and tran tali. All dancers are required to be college students but may attend a different college from which they represent. Teams are expected to be in traditional Garba-Raas clothing. Routines are commonly constructed with a theme presented throughout the dance through props and special effects. On stage the dance is described as &quot;very intense and high-energy: (1) the music is usually at a faster tempo than the other forms of Garba-Raas discussed previously, (2) dancers are taught a form of fast head-bobbing, (3) manic smiles are pasted on each dancer in order to emphasize enthusiasm to judges&quot;.

Male and female students typically perform competitive Garba-raas with 12-16 dancers on stage at a time and always in even numbers if possible, even though the routine itself is not completely based on partner interactions. Dancers take up an entire auditorium stage with different types of formations and movements throughout an approximately six-minute dance piece. Throughout the piece, dancers either do choreography facing the audience or interact with other partners on stage for short periods of time in a reference to the traditional roots of Garba-raas. Unlike traditional dandiya-raas or Garba, collegiate Garba-raas do not have a set centre focal point.

==== Raas All-Stars ====
Raas All-Stars (RAS) is the national organization under which the collegiate Garba-Raas competitions and teams function. RAS was established in 2009. They are responsible for certifying eligible competitions and hosting the national championship at the end of each season.

===== Structure =====
The competition season for Garba-Raas takes place at the beginning of each calendar year (January to April). In order to compete under the RAS organization, teams must submit applications to the certified competitions, known as Bid Competitions, by a set deadline. The application commonly includes an audition video of the team displaying a dance to three songs. Eight teams are then selected and invited to compete by the board of each individual competition. Each competition awards the top three teams, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place with 4 bid points, 2 bid points, and 1 bid point, respectively. The 8 teams with the highest cumulative bid point total are invited to the national RAS competition.

===== Judging =====

Garba-Raas performances are judged on three elements: Artistic Elements, Choreography and Execution. Bid competitions are required to have at minimum five judges (two Choreography, two Execution and one Artistic Element) but ideally have more than one judge per category, with the highest number of judges being nine per panel (three per category). All three elements are judged on their respective &quot;WOW&quot; factors (term coined by the rubric), and team captains receive comments on their team&#x27;s performances from the judges after every team has competed and been ranked.

During the competition itself, there are strict guidelines the judges must follow: &quot;During the show, the judges will sit separately to avoid any discussion of performances. This means that judges from the same category cannot sit next to each other. (For example, choreography and execution may be next to each other, but two choreography judges must be sitting separately.) The judges will also avoid any use of electronic devices, such as cell phones or laptops. During competing performances, the judges will score teams using the Raas All-Stars judging rubric. The judges may consider writing any qualitative notes on scratch paper for use in deliberation.&quot; Judging rubrics for all RAS Bid Competitions are created and curated by the Executive Board of Raas All-Stars. All three rubrics are standardized each year so that judging criteria across all competitions and teams are consistent.

======Criteria======
Artistic elements include many elements of the performance that do not involve choreography, but are crucial nonetheless and ranked by judges using a rubric standardized by the RAS organization. &quot;As the regulatory body, RAS creates and executes the criteria for choosing and judging these competitions&quot;. The theme of the competing team&#x27;s performance is assessed, including the creativity of the theme and the execution in regards to the set, props and various gimmicks a team may perform. The rubric includes prompts such as: &quot;Does the theme incorporation seem to naturally fit with the team&#x27;s performance without taking away from the dance or does it seem forced?&quot; Additionally, music is assessed regarding its tempo, rhythm and appeal within the performance. Historically, thematic judging is more nuanced than other elements because of personal opinions a judge or elder members of the Garba-Raas community may have.

Choreography is judged via a similar rubric, however the judges for this element are required to have significant experience and are vetted properly by the RAS Executive Board prior to being given the position. A team&#x27;s choreography is judged by the opening and closing sequences, formations, originality, musicality, proximity to traditional Garba-Raas, complexity, structure and pacing. Execution is judged by a third rubric, which includes categories such as recovery, synchronization, transitions, energy, grace and overall impression.

<text>A fixed asset (also known as long-lived assets or property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E)) is a term used in accounting for assets and property that may not easily be converted into cash. Fixed assets are different from current assets, such as cash or bank accounts, because the latter are liquid assets. In most cases, only tangible assets are referred to as fixed.

While IAS 16 (International Accounting Standard) does not define the term &quot;fixed asset&quot;, it is often colloquially considered a synonym for property, plant and equipment. According to IAS 16.6, property, plant and equipment are tangible items that: 

(a) are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and 

(b) are expected to be used during more than one period.

Fixed assets are one of two types:
* &quot;Freehold Assets&quot;: assets which are purchased with legal right of ownership and used, and 
* &quot;Leasehold Assets&quot;: assets used by owner with temporary ownership rights for a particular period of time.

A fixed asset can also be defined as an asset not directly sold to a firm&#x27;s consumers or end-users.

==Non-current assets==
In modern financial accounting usage, the term &quot;fixed assets&quot; can be ambiguous. Instead, the term &quot;non-current assets&quot; (used by the IFRS and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) XBRL reporting taxonomies) is preferred when referring to assets that will not be liquidated in the current fiscal period. Specific non-current assets (Property, plant and equipment, Investment property, Goodwill, Intangible assets other than goodwill, etc.) should be referred to by name.

A baking firm&#x27;s current assets would be its inventory (flour, yeast, etc.), the value of sales owed to the firm from credit extended (i.e. debtors or accounts receivable), and cash held in the bank. Its non-current assets would be the oven used to bake bread, motor vehicles used to transport deliveries, and cash registers used to handle cash payments. While these non-current assets have value, they are not directly sold to consumers and cannot be easily converted to cash.

Non-current (fixed) assets are items of value that the organization has bought and will use for an extended period of time, typically including land and buildings, motor vehicles, furniture, office equipment, computers, fixtures and fittings, and plant and machinery. These often receive a favorable tax treatment (in the form of a depreciation allowance) in contrast to short-term assets.

Note that the cost of a fixed asset is its purchase price including import duties, after subtracting any deductible trade discounts and rebates. It also includes the cost of transporting and installing the asset on-site and an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removal once it is no longer needed due to obsolescence or irreparable breakdown.

==Accounting treatment==
The primary objective of a business entity is to be profitable and increase the wealth of its owners. To do so, management must exercise due care and diligence by matching the expenses for a given period with the revenues of the same period. The period of use of revenue generating assets is usually more than a year, i.e. long term. To accurately determine the &quot;Net Income&quot; (profit) for a period, incremental depreciation of the total value of the asset must be charged against the revenue of the same period. Doing so is necessary for determining &quot;Net Revenue&quot;.

&quot;Net book value&quot; of an asset is the difference between the historical cost of that asset and its associated depreciation. Under most financial accounting standards (Standard Accounting Statement (SAS) 3 and IAS 16), the value of fixed assets are recorded and reported at net book value. Also, carrying assets at net book value is the most meaningful way to capture asset values for the owners of the business and potential investors.

===Depreciating a fixed asset===
Depreciation is the expense generated by using an asset. It is the wear and tear and thus diminution in the historical value due to usage. It is also the cost of the asset less any salvage value over its estimated useful life. A fixed asset can be depreciated using the straight line method which is the most common form of depreciation. Tax depreciation is commonly calculated differently than depreciation for financial reporting.

<doc id="1272491" wikidata="Q204476" url="?curid=1272491" title="Aleksandr Khanzhonkov">
<text>Aleksandr Alekseevich Khanzhonkov (; — 26 September 1945) was a pioneering Russian cinema entrepreneur, film director and screenwriter. He is known for producing &quot;Defence of Sevastopol&quot;, Russia&#x27;s first feature film, as well as Ladislas Starevich&#x27;s ground-breaking stop motion animation. Most of his career was in Russian Empire. During 1923-1926 he worked in the Soviet Union, where his career ended with a financial scandal, however his past achievements earned him a personal pension and an apartment from the state.

==Early years==
Khanzhonkov was born in the small village of Khanzhonkova of the Don Host Oblast (modern-day Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast) into a noble family of Don Cossacks. His father Alexei Petrovich Khanzhonkov was a landlord who went bankrupt. His mother Paraskeva Sergeevna Khanzhonkova (née Dmitrieva) came from a colonel&#x27;s family who owned a Singer shop in Moscow. The noble title was first granted to Aleksandr&#x27;s great-grandfather Vasily Khanzhonkov.

He studied in the Novocherkassk Cossack School and was sent to serve in the Moscow host after his graduation in 1886. He took part in the Russo-Japanese War which undermined his health. In 1905, upon a discharge from military training due to health issues, Khanzhonkov sat in on a screening of Train Pulling into a Station by the Lumiere Brothers.

==Career==
In 1906 Khanzhonkov founded Russia&#x27;s first cinema factory, A. Khanzhonkov and Co., whose main financial backer was Ivan Ozerov, an influential banker and member of the Russian State Council. Initial productions were shot on stage in the vein of Melies and were overshadowed by the work of Alexander Drankov. Known for his unabashed commercialism, Drankov would remain a competitor up to the revolution of 1917.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1911 that Khanzhonkov&#x27;s factory would receive widespread acclaim with the release of &quot;Defence of Sevastopol&quot;. One of the earliest full length Russian feature films, it was equally notable for its technical aspects. By the end of 1912, Khanzhonkov had established a permanent studio in Moscow and went on to produce over a hundred films over the course of the next several years. Much of Khanzhonkov&#x27;s work during this time period went &quot;virtually unseen by the Russian masses&quot; and often took aim at aristocratic sensibilities or adapted great Russian novels of the 19th century. Nonetheless, Khanzhonov helped create many standards in Russian cinema production; the first confirmed use of artificial light in the Russian film industry takes place in a Khanzhonkov documentary piece.

During the Russian Revolution, Khanzhonkov fled Russia to Constantinople and Vienna, and, despite previous affiliation with the royal family, returned upon invitation to the USSR in 1923 and was appointed director of the new Soviet studio Proletkino and later as a production consultant for Goskino. His career in the Soviet Union ended in 1926: he was forced to abdicate after a corruption scandal struck Proletkino, and never worked in cinema again. Khanzhonkov spent the rest of his life in Yalta, living on a personal pension from the state. There he survived the Nazi occupation of Crimea in 1941–1944, and died in Yalta after many years of declining health on September 26, 1945.

<doc id="1272503" wikidata="Q63763" url="?curid=1272503" title="Bay, Laguna">
<text>Bay (), officially the Municipality of Bay (), and colloquially known as Bae (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 67,182 people.

The patron saint of Bay is Saint Augustine of Hippo, whose Feast Day is celebrated during August 28.

Laguna de Bay, the country&#x27;s largest freshwater lake, is named after the town.

==Etymology==
In the old Tagalog language, the name Bay derives from the same phonetic roots as &quot;&quot;baybay&quot; (shore) and as &quot;babae&quot; (woman) and &quot;babaylan&quot;&quot; (priestess). The name can thus be thought of either as a reference to the shore of the lake, or to a great lady (cf. Sanskrit &quot;bai&quot;). In the case of the latter, it has been suggested that the great lady might be the same as Maria Makiling, as her mountain was within the scope of Bay&#x27;s original territory.

The municipality was first inhabited by settlers under Datu Gat Pangil. R.P. Martin de Rada&#x27;s mission resulted with Gat Pangil and his three daughters converting to the Catholic faith. The colloquial name of Bay, Bae is the old name of the town which came from three daughters of Datu Gat Pangil—Basilisa, Angela and Elena. For the modern or official name (Bay), it became Basilisa, Angela and Y&#x27;llena.

==History==

Just like the rest of the archipelago, the town of Bay has no record before the coming of Spaniards in the 18th century. Bay existed long before the coming of Spaniards. The Chinese must have come to the lakeshore towns to trade as early as the 9th century. The earliest account of Bay appeared in the conquest of island of Luzon published in April 20, 1572. It was described a great lake of fresh water, 12-league wide and very deep. The villages around the lake had about 25,000 inhabitants when Captain Juan de Salcedo arrived in the area.

Bay is one of the oldest towns in Laguna province, and was the province&#x27;s first capital. Its original territory covered the areas that are now known as Los Baños, Calauan, Alaminos and San Pablo (in addition to its current territory). The Spaniards pronounced the name of the town &quot;Bah-ee&quot; while the natives called it &quot;Bah-eh.&quot; Either way, the similarity in spelling has led to the misconception that the town was named after Laguna de Bay. Instead, the Spaniards named the lake after this ancient Tagalog community.

The &quot;official&quot; recorded history of Bay, may be gleaned from Gaspar de San Agustin&#x27;s Conquestas de las Islas Filipinas of 1963 and Fr. Joaquin Martines de Zuniga&#x27;s status of the Philippine Islands in 1800. Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, after establishing the city of Manila on June 24, 1571, ordered the exploration and pacification of the surrounding villages and settlements. Martin de Goiti led a contingent towards Pampanga while Juan de Salcedo Legaspi&#x27;s 22-year-old grandson led a contingent up to the Pasig River towards the inter lands of Laguna de Bay.

With him was Fr. Alonzo Alvarado, an Augustinian who was very zealous in converting the natives. From Taytay and Cainta in Manila, Salcedo proceeded to Bay, Liliw, Nagcarlan and Majayjay and to other towns where up-on Fr. Alvarado&#x27;s intercession, the natives surrendered peacefully with Fray Diego de Espinar and 60 men. He followed the rugged trails of the mountainous village of Sampaloc towards the Bicol Region to look for gold which he found in the gold mines besides the Bicol River.

In 1571, Fr. Martin de Rada, the superior of the Augustinian religious order who came with the Legaspi expedition in 1565, started to build a bamboo and nipa church under the patronage of Saint Augustine along the lakeshore of Bay (i.e. Aplaya, now San Antonio). He became the first parish priest of Bay. On April 30, 1578, Fr. Joaquin de Zuniega stated in the Historical view of the Philippine Island that Bay was organized both as a town and a parish with Fray Juan Gallegos as the parish priest. On the same day, the village of Sampaloc (now San Pablo) was made a visita of the lake side village where it was believed that the tribunal of Ecclesiastical visitors of Bay was held. Fray Gaspar de San Agustin further wrote that in 1586, the Augustinian Fathers organized the visita into a convent with a priest. The provincial Fr. Diego Alvarez to handle the administration of the Christian natives. Thus, Sampaloc which came to be known as San Pablo de los Montes, ceased to be part of the Bay parish.

The powerful Gat Pangil was Datu of this already thriving community in 1571 when 18-year-old Spanish Capitan Juan de Salcedo landed with Augustinian missionaries Alfonso de Alvarado and Diego Espinar came to claim the territories for Spain. It was salcedo who took the name of the town and named the lake after it – Laguna de Bay (the Lake of [the town of] Bay). Eventually, the Spanish came to call the whole province &quot;&quot;La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay&quot;.&quot;

In 1581, San Antonio de Bay became the capital of the Province of Laguna de Bay and remained so until 1688 when the capital was moved to Pagsanjan.

Grocery stores, dress shops, hardware and sari-sari stores sprouted surrounding the train station where people shopped their primary needs, making it a festive place.

In 2010, jars estimated by experts to date as far back as 800 B.C were found in Puypuy. University of the Philippines anthropologist Dr. Bonifacio Comandante, who headed the team who helped unearth the finds, suggested that the find indicates that &quot;there was a community here and they used the pots and jars for jar-burial&quot;&quot;, essentially confirming a human presence in Barangay Puypuy as early as 800 B.C.

&quot;Fear&quot; is the first of Cale&#x27;s three studio albums for Island Records, all of which were released in a period of just over a year. During this time Cale was also producing records for other artists, working on albums such as &quot;Horses&quot; (1975) by Patti Smith, one of the most influential of all proto-punk records.

In addition to his lead vocals on &quot;Fear&quot;, Cale also played keyboards, guitars, viola, violin and bass, and was joined by Fairport Convention&#x27;s Richard Thompson, Roxy Music&#x27;s Brian Eno and Phil Manzanera, and other artists who were signed to Island at the time.

&quot;Gun&quot; features an unusual two-man guitar solo from Manzanera and Eno, with the latter using a synthesizer to process the former&#x27;s guitar playing in real-time. The promotional album for &quot;Fear&quot; released by Island Records contained an interview with Cale. He announced an adaption of the William Blake poem &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, and cover versions of the songs &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; by Bob Dylan, &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; by the Byrds and &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; by the Who.

The cover photography was by Keith Morris.

==Release==
&quot;Fear&quot; was released on 1 October 1974. &quot;The Man Who Couldn&#x27;t Afford to Orgy&quot; b/w &quot;Sylvia Said&quot; was released as a single.

The album was remastered in 1996 as part of the 2CD release &quot;The Island Years&quot;, containing also both &quot;Slow Dazzle&quot; (1975) and &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1975). It contained &quot;Sylvia Said (Remix)&quot; as a bonus track. The single version of &quot;Sylvia Said&quot; remained unissued on CD as of 2018.

==Critical reception==

Mick Brown of &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; said &quot;Fear&quot; was &quot;in many ways a patchwork of [Cale&#x27;s] past. His motif, as defined on &quot;Paris 1919&quot;, remains clean, compact, clever melodies, written and produced with a clear understanding of the subtle nuances of mood the simplest of chord structures and breaks can evoke. But the extravagant orchestration which characterized the last solo album has been largely abandoned in favor of a sparser, more barren sound, with just the barest backing essentials augmenting Cale&#x27;s vocals.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Let It Rock&quot;, Mick Gold said: &quot;Cale has the voice of a chameleon. It&#x27;s never great singing but his deadpan Welsh-American accent gives it just the right edge. His music has broadened its range whilst also sounding more pared-down. And at least five songs on this album stand equal to the best songs of the 70s. I think it&#x27;s self-evident from Paris and Fear that Cale&#x27;s work is more original and more enjoyable than the albums being put out by a dozen better-known artists.&quot;

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; called &quot;Fear&quot; &quot;a brilliant record full of neat surprises and great, unsettling songs.&quot;

<text>The Laser Standard or ILCA 7 is a popular one-design class of single-handed sailing dinghy, originally built by Performance Sailcraft Canada. The laser is cat rigged, with a single mainsail and is a simple, light and fast boat to sail. The Laser Standard is the original of the Laser family of dinghies, which also includes the Laser Radial and Laser 4.7, both of which use the same hull, but have smaller rigs.

<doc id="1272541" wikidata="Q3827350" url="?curid=1272541" title="Laser 4.7">
<text>The Laser 4.7 or ILCA 4 is a one-design dinghy class in the Laser series and is a one-design class of sailboat. All Lasers are built to the same specifications. The Laser is 4.06 m (13 ft 10 in) long, with a waterline length of 3.81 m (12 ft 6 in). The hull weight is 59 kg (130 lb). The boat is manufactured by ILCA and World Sailing approved builders.

Lasers are cat-rigged, meaning they have only one sail. The 4.7 uses the same hull and top mast section as the Laser, but has a different, shorter bottom mast section as well as a smaller sail. The bottom mast section is pre-bent which effectively reduces the power of the rig, and the sail is only 4.7 square meters, as opposed to 7 for the Laser Standard or 5.7 for the Laser Radial. (ILCA 6) The smaller sail means that the 4.7 can be easily sailed by sailors weighing only 50–65 kg (110–145 lb), though this boat can still be sailed competitively at all levels under and over the ideal weights.

==Description==
The Laser 4.7 has been increasing in popularity around the world since the late 1990s. In some areas it is less popular than the Byte dinghy, a very similar class also designed as a youth single-handed racing trainer, but the interchangeability of the rigs of the Laser series has always made them popular. It is popular among youth sailors graduating from the Optimist sailing dinghy and also the Topper (dinghy), and many 4.7 sailors graduate to the Laser Radial (ILCA 6) as they progress their sailing abilitie and size. The Laser 4.7 is also sailed widely at a club level as the smaller rig suits the more inexperienced sailors.

<doc id="1272544" wikidata="Q7295751" url="?curid=1272544" title="Rational Youth">
<text>Rational Youth was a Canadian new wave synth-pop band that was originally active between 1981 and 1986, and at various points up until the end of 2021.

==History==
Rational Youth was formed in 1981 in Montreal, Quebec, by synthesizer players Tracy Howe and Bill Vorn, both of whom idolized the German synthpop pioneers Kraftwerk. The band is considered to be one of Canada&#x27;s first synthpop groups.

Howe&#x27;s music career began as a singer and drummer for Montreal punk band The Normals. Howe was later a drummer and singer in Montreal band Heaven Seventeen (not to be confused with England&#x27;s Heaven 17), considered to be one of the first punk bands to use synthesizers. One of Heaven Seventeen&#x27;s keyboard players was Ivan Doroschuk, who later formed Men Without Hats. Howe also later joined Men Without Hats, as a guitarist, prior to forming Rational Youth with Vorn.

The band was formed in the summer of 1981 by Howe and Vorn, joined by keyboardist Mario Spezza. The band&#x27;s second professional engagement was opening for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, in Montreal.

The band recorded their first single &quot;I Want To See The Light&quot; in 1981 for YUL Records, an independent label established by Marc Demouy, a record importer and retailer, and Pat Deserio. Demouy also became the band&#x27;s manager. Shortly after the single was issued, Spezza left and was replaced by Kevin Komoda (keyboards).

The Howe/Vorn/Komoda trio then recorded the album &quot;Cold War Night Life&quot;, which was issued in early 1982 and was the first all-synth pop release in Canada. It became one of the biggest-selling Canadian independent albums at the time.

Vorn left the band at the beginning of 1983 to resume communication studies at university. He earned a doctorate in communication studies at the Université du Québec à Montréal, and is a full professor in the Department of Studio Arts at Concordia University. He has been active in the field of robotic art since 1992.

Following Vorn&#x27;s departure, the group — now consisting of Howe (vocals, keyboards, guitars), Komoda (keyboards), Denis Duran (bass) and Angel Calvo (drums) -- was signed to Capitol Records. That year, Rational Youth issued an eponymous EP. Following the release of the EP and immediately before a national promotional tour, Komoda, Duran and Calvo left the band, purportedly because of about the level of full-time commitment. Howe, left with the band name but no band, did not form another band to tour in support of the EP. Komoda later became a radio producer for CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Brave New Waves&quot;.

A subsequent album, &quot;Heredity&quot;, was released in 1985 under the Rational Youth name, although Howe was now the only permanent group member. The album was recorded with the participation of over a dozen session musicians, including Dee Long of Klaatu (guitars, keyboards), Ken Sinnaeve of Tom Cochrane and Red Rider (bass), and Ben Mink of FM (violin, mandolin). Peter McGee (guitars, keyboards) and John Jones (keyboards) also made significant contributions to the record and participated in the songwriting. Amongst the eight keyboard players employed, ex-members Vorn and Komoda also appeared on &quot;Heredity&quot;, both credited with &quot;additional keyboards&quot;. Howe and Long produced.

The decision to release the album under the Rational Youth name was that of the record company, Capitol Records, though Howe did not oppose the decision. The record, while successful, is viewed as having created a different audience for Rational Youth, confusing older fans. All three singles from the album (&quot;No More And No Less&quot;, &quot;Call Me&quot; and &quot;Bang On&quot;) scraped into the lower reaches of the Canadian charts, hitting chart peaks of #87, #89 and #91, respectively.

Howe put a band together and toured in support of &quot;Heredity&quot; during 1985 and 1986. The touring band consisted of Howe (vocals, keyboards), Rick Joudrey (bass), Owen Tennyson (drums), Kevin Breit (guitars) and Jim MacDonald (keyboards).

Shortly after filming a cameo in the film &quot;Crazy Moon&quot; (to which they contributed two songs), Howe placed the band on &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; in February 1986. However, continued interest in the band, particularly in Europe, resulted in &quot;Cold War Night Life&quot; being reissued on compact disc in 1997. This in turn led to a 1997 reunion concert with Howe and Vorn in Lund, Sweden.

In 1999, Rational Youth, with a new lineup of original frontman Howe and new keyboard players Jean-Claude Cutz and Dave Rout, released its first album after fourteen years, &quot;To the Goddess Electricity&quot;. Cutz and Rout had been members of techno-industrial band Digital Poodle.

Rational Youth toured throughout Scandinavia over the next two years, playing its final concert on November 3, 2001, at the Tinitus Festival in Stockholm, Sweden.

Original members Tracy Howe and Bill Vorn came together again in 2009, at the initiative of Marc Demouy, recording a new version of their 1982 track &quot;Dancing On The Berlin Wall&quot; in honour of the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Wall. In 2010, the recording was issued by YUL Records as a CD EP. In 2011, another CD EP was released, &quot;City Of Night /Cite Phosphore&quot;, consisting of re-recordings of an early single, as well as remixed versions of the original recording.

Later that year, Kevin Komoda rejoined, thus reuniting the &quot;Cold War Night Life&quot; Rational Youth trio. This trio issued yet another re-recorded single, the CD EP &quot;Coboloid Race/I Want To See The Light 30th Anniversary Edition&quot;. The release included newly re-recorded songs and newly discovered alternative mixes from the original 1981 sessions.

In 2013, the band issued a number of archival recordings, including live material recorded in Ottawa and Winnipeg in 1983. A rarities compilation called &quot;Magic Box&quot; was also released, which consisted of early 1980s Rational Youth demos and remixes, and solo recordings from Howe, Vorn and Komoda.

In 2014 the band did a few shows as a six piece, featuring Tracy Howe on vocals and synth, Kevin Komoda on synths, Brian Arsenault on synths, Scott Cameron on bass, Paul Grainville on drums, backing vocals, Gaenor Howe on electronic percussion, theremin, backing vocals. This lineup played in Montreal on January 10, Ottawa on January 18 and four shows in Scandinavia in April and May 2014, billed together with the band Psyche. In November 2014, Rational Youth paired with Psyche to record and issue a cover of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, a collaborative single that credited both bands.

In May 2016 Rational Youth (now a two-piece with Tracy and Gaenor Howe) released the EP &quot;Future Past Tense&quot; through Artoffact Records.

In September 2016, the band appeared on the compilation, &quot;Heresy,&quot; released by Cold War Night Life&quot;.&quot; A play on the title of &quot;Heredity&quot;, &quot;Heresy&quot; also featured covers of Rational Youth tracks by eighteen artists from Canada, Norway, Britain, Sweden and Germany. Contributions included recordings by former band members, Dave Rout and Kevin Komoda, as well as collaborators Psyche.

In 2019, &quot;Cold War Night Life&quot; was re-released in deluxe 2-LP and CD formats by Universal Music Canada.

In early 2020, Rational Youth undertook their final live performances, with Canadian shows alongside UK band China Crisis and a tour of Mexico, with a final performance in Mexico City on 7 March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic began to take hold, affecting many aspects of normal life, not the least of which were international travel and live music globally.

In 2021, to mark the 40th anniversary of Rational Youth&#x27;s founding, the band released the EP &quot;Wavelength&quot; on their Donkeyland label. Three of the EPs four tracks were re-recordings of songs from their self-titled EP of 1983.

<text>The is the remote northeastern cape of the Japanese island of Honshū, stretching out towards Hokkaidō.

== Overview ==

It is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east, Tsugaru Strait to the north and Mutsu Bay to the west and south. Shaped like an axe pointing west, the peninsula has a thin &quot;axe handle&quot; connecting the mountainous &quot;axe blade&quot; to the mainland of Honshū to the south. The peninsula contains the northernmost point on Honshū, Cape Ōma, and the largest sand dunes in Japan (the Sarugamori Sand Dunes).

The peninsula owes its name to its being the lower (&quot;shimo&quot;) portion of the former Kita District (North District) of Mutsu Province before the premodern province was divided in 1868.

Administratively the area is a part of Aomori Prefecture, and the bulk of the area falls within the jurisdiction of the city of Mutsu, with a number of small towns and villages along the periphery. Most of the inhabitants live in coastal areas rather than the mountainous interior.

Portions of the peninsula are within the borders of Shimokita Hantō Quasi-National Park, including Cape Ōma, the coastline of the village of Sai to the south, including seaside cliffs said to resemble Buddhas at Hotokegaura, Cape Shiriya to the northeast, and the volcanic interior of the peninsula, including Mount Osore and Lake Usori. Tourist attractions include 
Yagen Valley, known for its hot springs.

Economically, the mainstays of the local economy are commercial fishing, forestry, and seasonal tourism. The main commercial centre is the city of Mutsu. The village of Rokkasho, at the southern end of Shimokita Peninsula, home to a range of nuclear facilities.

In 2012, Japan set a new world record for ocean drilling depth, reaching 2,111 meters below the seafloor off Shimokita Peninsula.

Since the Eemian interglacial some 125,000 years ago the coast of the eastern tip of the peninsula has been uplifted on average 0.14–0.25 meters every thousand years (m/kyr). Slightly to the west the a north-facing sandy coast has uplift rates of 0.14–0.23 m/kyr for the same period. Further to the west, on top of the trace line of the volcanic front rates over the same period are in the order of 0.09–0.18 m/kyr. This uplift is related to the activity of offshore geological faults that has bended strata into an anticline.

This peninsula is also called &quot;Axe Peninsula&quot; from the shape.

<doc id="1272552" wikidata="Q1377333" url="?curid=1272552" title="Mount Osore">
<text>is the name of a Buddhist temple and folk religion pilgrimage destination in the center of remote Shimokita Peninsula of Aomori Prefecture, in the northern Tōhoku region of northern Japan. The temple is located in the caldera of an active volcano and is believed in Japanese mythology to be one of the gates to the underworld.

==Etymology==
The name originally comes from the Ainu language, with the form later phonetically changed when borrowed into the Japanese language to match the Japanese word &quot;osore&quot; (), meaning &quot;dread&quot;, likely due to the desolation of the volcanic landscape. The Ainu name for the area may have been &quot;usori&quot; (of indeterminate meaning), or &quot;ushoro&quot; (&quot;gulf, large bay&quot;, possibly in reference to Mutsu Bay) or possibly even &quot;usat oro nupuri&quot; (&quot;mountain in cinders&quot;, a name recorded in some of the stories about Ennin).

==Mount Osore volcano==
The mountain is one peak of the , a series of eight somma volcanos ranging from east to west in the centre of Shimokita Peninsula. Mount Osore has a height of . Although Mount Osore last erupted over 10,000 years ago, the area has many fumaroles emitting steam and volcanic gases (especially sulfur dioxide), indicating that it is still an active volcano. Lake Usori is a caldera lake at the center of Mount Osore, with highly acidic waters.

During the Meiji period, sulphur deposits in the area were exploited, partly to meet the demand for gunpowder production by the growing Japanese military; however the deposits were not economical to mine due to the remoteness of the site and the increasing availability of sulphur as a byproduct of petroleum refining.

==Bodai-ji temple and pilgrimage location==
The mountain is the location of a Sōtō Zen Buddhist temple, , which claims to have been founded in 862 AD by the famed monk Ennin, with Jizō Bosatsu as its main image. The temple was abandoned in 1457 and restored back to use in 1530. In popular folk religion, the otherworldly setting of Mount Osore, with its charred landscape of blasted rocks filled with bubbling pits noted for unearthly hues and noxious fumes came to be one of several places in Japan identified to be an entrance to the Underworld. A small brook running to the neighboring Lake Usori was equated to the Sanzu River, a river that deceased souls need to cross on their way to the afterlife.

A unique feature of Bodai-ji is the presence of mediums known as &quot;itako&quot; who claim to summon the souls of the dead and deliver messages in their voices. These mediums were traditionally blind and had to receive extensive spiritual training and purification rituals; however, in modern times, their number has dwindled and not all are blind. The temple has a twice-yearly &quot;Itako Taisai&quot; festival held in summer and autumn.

The temple also maintains a hot spring resort for use by pilgrims and tourists.

===In modern culture===
The work of contemporary artist Nara Yoshitomo, who is a native of Aomori Prefecture, is believed to be influenced, at least subconsciously, by Mount Osore (Ivy, 2010). For instance, his piece entitled “Not Everything But/ Green House” depicts a small female child standing over a pile of discarded dolls of varying characteristics and eras much like those observed at Mount Osore.

As part of a collection of &quot;fictional fungi&quot;, artist Takeshi Yamada created the Oh-dokuro-dake (or “skull mushroom”) and the story surrounding their presence on Mount Osore for his &quot;center for medical mycology&quot; art project.

The name &quot;Misbourne&quot; is first attested, in the form &quot;Misseburne&quot;, in 1407. The &quot;-bourne&quot; element is agreed to derive from Old English &quot;burna&quot; (&#x27;stream, river&#x27;), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. It is thought to occur in the names of both Great and Little Missenden, and also in the Tring place-name Miswell. Frank Stenton and Allen Mawer guessed that it came from a hypothetical Anglo-Saxon personal name &quot;Myrsa&quot;, which they also supposed to be found in the name of Mursley. Eilert Ekwall suggested that it came from a lost Old English word related to English &quot;moss&quot;, and to Danish &quot;mysse&quot; and Swedish &quot;missne&quot; (which denote plants of the genus &quot;Calla&quot;, such as water arum). Recent researchers have tentatively preferred Ekwall&#x27;s guess, in which case the name &quot;Misbourne&quot; would once have meant something like &#x27;river where water-plants/marsh-plants grow&#x27;.

==History==

In 1906 the Great Western Railway (GWR) constructed the Chalfont Viaduct to carry trains between London and across the river. In the mid-1980s, when the M25 was being constructed, the Misbourne was diverted under the motorway via underground concrete culverts. The route of the motorway was then aligned to pass through the arches of the Chalfont Viaduct.

==Flow==
The river flows over a bed of impermeable material on top of a porous substrate. This state is only quasi-stable since in periods of low rainfall the water table drops below the level of the impermeable layer. If groundworks are then carried out which damage this layer, the river can sink into the porous substrate and disappear.

The Misbourne has had intermittently reduced or stopped-flow due to abstraction for domestic supply from the aquifers feeding it. This has caused its course to be neglected to lead to partial obstruction. When the water company undertook remedial measures to restore the flow, there were episodes of flooding in both Chalfont St Peter and Chalfont St Giles. Subsequent work has restored the integrity of the course. The upper part of the river was dry for over 3 years starting in November 2003 but re-appeared in February 2007 following several months of above-average rainfall which raised the water table.

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; () is the national anthem of Mali. Adopted in 1962, it was written by Seydou Badian Kouyaté, while the music is attributed to Banzumana Sissoko. It is popularly known as &quot;&#x27;&quot; () or &quot;&quot; ().

==History==
The anthem was written by Seydou Badian Kouyaté around the time of the dissolution of the Mali Federation with Senegal in 1960, which left Mali without a flag or anthem. In a 2010 interview, Kouyaté stated that President Modibo Keïta had been passing through his locality when he approached Kouyaté and asked him to create a song to help the youth remember Malian pre-independence politician Mamadou Konaté. Kouyaté created a song called &quot;. Keïta then called Kouyaté and told him to try creating something for the national anthem. Kouyaté made a draft for a national anthem and sang it with Keïta, who was pleased with it. Kouyaté stated that Keïta had previously received a proposal for a national anthem by a European pianist residing in the Malian capital, Bamako, but he rejected it, because he wanted something that had an aura of Africa and Mali. Kouyaté reworked an air dating back to the 13th century and the Mali Empire. The musical arrangement is credited to jeli Banzumana Sissoko.

The anthem was officially adopted just under a year after independence, by law n° 62-72 of 9 August 1962. The Malian Young Pioneer movement of the 1960s translated it into Bambara for its rallies as &quot;. The translation is credited to Abdulay Bari. It is traditionally played at state ceremonies by the band of the of the Armed Forces of Mali.

<text>Biñan (), officially the City of Biñan (), is a component city in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 407,437, making it the third largest in population in the province of Laguna, after Calamba and Santa Rosa.

Biñan has become both a suburban residential community of Metro Manila and a location for some of the Philippines&#x27; largest industrial estates and export processing zones. Prior to its cityhood in 2010, Biñan was the richest municipality in the Philippines with an annual gross income of () and net income of ₱250 million (US$5.308 million), as of 2007 by the Commission on Audit.

By virtue of Republic Act No. 10658, signed on March 27, 2015, by President Benigno Aquino III, Biñan has been separated from the first congressional district of Laguna and formed the lone congressional district of Biñan.

==Etymology==
Where Biñan got its name is a mystery. Some deduced that before Captain Juan de Salcedo proceeded to Cainta and Taytay finally reaching Bay, he landed in Biñan. According to the story, Padres Alfonso de Alvarado and Diego Espinar planted a huge wooden cross on the spot where the present-day San Isidro Labrador parish stands and co-celebrated a Thanksgiving Mass. Curious natives gathered and the two Spanish missionaries took advantage of the situation. They baptized each one of them. From then on, old folks say they called the place “Binyagan,” which means a baptismal place in Tagalog. The place&#x27;s root word &quot;&quot; is originally a Brunei Malay word which means “to pour water from above,” according to the dictionary &quot;Vocabulario de la lengua tagala&quot;. The Spanish tongue&#x27;s difficulty in pronouncing the local dialect acquired for the once town its name — &quot;Biñan&quot;.

An 1846 book in French also spelled the town as Viñan. It is also spelled in other references as Biniang, Binyang, Binang, or Biñang.

==History==
Captain Juan de Salcedo explored Laguna de Bay and founded Biñan at the end of June 1571, a month after Miguel López de Legazpi established Manila. In 1644, Dominican friars turned the area into a hacienda known as Hacienda de San Isidro Labrador de Biñán, in honor of Saint Isidore the Laborer. When the seat of the provincial government of the &quot;Provincia de la Laguna de Bay&quot; was transferred from Bay to Pagsanjan in 1688, Biñan separated from Tabuco (now the city of Cabuyao). In the 1600s Biñan had 256 Chinese-Filipino and 1,639 Native Filipino tributes.

In 1747, the Spaniards officially converted Biñan into a &quot;pueblo&quot; (town). Santa Rosa separated from Biñan in 1791 and was later established as an independent town on January 18, 1792.

Historically, Biñan has gained recognition nationwide for being part of the life of José Rizal, one of the country&#x27;s national hero. In June 1869, when Rizal was a child, he traveled to Biñan with his brother Paciano. They moved into his aunt&#x27;s home, which would serve as their lodging, near the town proper. Here, he received his first formal education through the tutelage of Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz and, after a year and a half of instruction, recommended the young Rizal to pursue higher education in Manila. The home where José Rizal resided was given a plaque of appreciation in his honor. Biñan&#x27;s town square now has a monument in the center honoring Biñan&#x27;s connection to Rizal.

In 1903, the adjacent towns of Muntinlupa, then part of Rizal province, and San Pedro Tunasan were consolidated with Biñan. Both towns were later separated when Muntinlupa was returned to Rizal as part of Taguig in 1905 and San Pedro Tunasan regained its independent municipality status effective 1907.

On January 26, 2015, a 15–0 vote from senators approved the House Bill No. 3917 in the third and final reading, amending the charter city of Biñan to a congressional district in Laguna and will be separated from the first district. Republic Act No. 10658, which President Aquino signed into law on March 27, 2015, separated Biñan from the first legislative district of Laguna. Under the law, the incumbent representative of the first district of Laguna will continue to represent the new district until the expiration of his term. The Commission on Elections was tasked to issue the necessary rules and regulations to implement the measure within 30 days after its effectivity.

<doc id="1272582" wikidata="Q1108818" url="?curid=1272582" title="Chartered accountant">
<text>Chartered accountants were the first accountants to form a professional accounting body, initially established in Scotland in 1854. The Edinburgh Society of Accountants (1854), the Glasgow Institute of Accountants and Actuaries (1854) and the Aberdeen Society of Accountants (1867) were each granted a royal charter almost from their inception. The title is an internationally recognised professional designation; the certified public accountant designation is generally equivalent to it. Women were able to become chartered accountants only following the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 after which, in 1920, Mary Harris Smith was recognised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and became the first woman chartered accountant in the world.

Chartered accountants work in all fields of business and finance, including auditing, taxation, financial and general management. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.

Chartered accountants&#x27; institutes require members to undertake a minimum level of continuing professional development to stay professionally competitive.
They facilitate special interest groups (for instance, entertainment and media, or insolvency and restructuring) which lead in their fields. They provide support to members by offering advisory services, technical helplines and technical libraries. They also offer opportunities for professional networking, career and business development.

Chartered Accountants Worldwide comprises 15 institutes with over 1.8 million Chartered Accountants and students in 190 countries.

==Countries==

=== Australia ===
Chartered accountants of Australia belong to the Chartered Accountants Australia &amp; New Zealand (CA ANZ, formerly the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia) and use the designatory letters &quot;CA&quot;. Some senior members (at least 15 years&#x27; membership) of the institute may be elected fellows and use the letters &quot;FCA&quot;. Of equal legal status and recognition in Australia as qualified professional accountants are Institute of Public Accountants (IPA) and CPA Australia. On 28 June 2016, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and CA ANZ announced a strategic alliance to provide an opportunity for dual membership of both bodies, which will add value for the members locally and globally. ACCA members resident in Australia and New Zealand will be invited to apply for CA membership and CA ANZ members will be invited to apply for ACCA membership, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria of the other body.

===Bangladesh===
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) is the national professional accounting body of Bangladesh. Established in 1973, it is the sole organization with the right to award the Chartered Accountant designation in Bangladesh. Senior members (at least five years&#x27; membership) of the institute are called &quot;fellow members&quot; and use the letters &quot;FCA&quot;.

Bangladesh has more than 1,900 registered Chartered Accountants and more than 32,000 articled students.

===Bermuda===
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda works with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and is the sole organisation in Bermuda with the right to award the Chartered Accountant designation.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, chartered accountants belong to the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) by way of membership in at least one provincial or territorial institute (or &quot;order&quot; in Quebec). In order to become a member, a candidate requires an undergraduate degree plus experience and, depending on the province, additional education. Candidates in all provinces are required to pass the three-day Uniform Evaluation (UFE) now Common Final Examination (CFE).

Since 2012, the CICA has been in a process of unification with the other two accounting bodies in Canada. Canadian CA&#x27;s, along with Certified General Accountants (CGAs) and Certified Management Accountants (CMAs), have now adopted the designation Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA), making the term &quot;chartered accountant&quot; obsolete.

=== Czech Republic ===
In the Czech Republic, Chartered Accountants are generally members of Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Czech Republic and use the designatory letters &quot;CAE&quot; (Chartered Accountant expert). Chartered Accountants may also be members of the Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic (KACR), with whom the ICAEW launched its ACA qualification in 2015.

=== European Union ===
Under the Mutual Recognition Directive, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss nationals holding a professional qualification can become members of the equivalent bodies in another member state.
They must, however, pass an aptitude test in understanding local conditions (which for accountants will include local tax and company law variations).

The local title is, however, not available for use if the professional does not choose to join the local professional body. For example, a holder of the French &quot;&quot;  qualification could practise as an accountant in England without taking a local test but could only describe themself as &quot;expert-comptable (France)&quot; not &quot;Chartered Accountant&quot;. Within the EEA, only the UK and Ireland have bodies that issue the Chartered Accountant title.

===India===
In India, Chartered Accountants are regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) which was established by the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. 
Associate members of the ICAI are entitled to add the prefix &quot;CA&quot; to their names. Members who has been in continuous practice in India for at least 5 years or a member who has been an associate for a continuous period of not less than 5 years and who possesses experience equivalent to the experience normally acquired as a result of continuous practice for a period of 5 years as chartered accountant can use &quot;Fellow Chartered Accountant(FCA)&quot;. As of 1st August 2024, the Institute had 414,758 active members.

Entry to the profession can be made by taking the CA Foundation Course after completion of schooling (12th grade). Alternatively, graduates may train as an articled assistant for three years in a chartered firm before final exam or after completion of Intermediate of Cost Accountant or Company Secretary.
A comprehensive 100 hours of information technology training and an orientation programme for soft skills development have to be completed before being articled. However the CA certification is limited to the geographical boundary of India and is not valid in countries that follow different standards of accounting practice. After clearing of CA final examination, one may apply for membership to ICAI.

=== Indonesia ===

The Institute of Indonesia Chartered Accountants, formerly Indonesian Institute of Accountants or Ikatan Akuntan Indonesia is the national organisation of professional accountants in Indonesia. IAI is a founding member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the ASEAN Federation of Accountants (AFA).
In 2016 IAI became an Associate Member of Chartered Accountants Worldwide.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, Chartered Accountants are generally members of Chartered Accountants Ireland and use the designatory letters ACA or FCA. Chartered accountants may also be members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales or the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, the profession of Chartered Accountancy is regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal (ICAN) which was established by parliament under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1997.

After completion of three levels of examination (CAP I, CAP II, and CAP III) with three years of articleship training under a qualified CA, one can get the membership of ICAN and with the Certificate of Practice (COP), one can practise as a professional accountant.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, Chartered Accountants belong to the Chartered Accountants Australia &amp; New Zealand (CA ANZ, formerly New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) and use the designatory letters CA. Some senior members may be elected fellows and use the letters FCA.

There is also a mid-tier qualification called Associate Chartered Accountant with the designatory letters ACA. Associate chartered accountants are not eligible to hold a certificate of public practice and therefore cannot offer services to the public.

=== Pakistan ===
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) is the professional body of Chartered Accountants in Pakistan, established on 1 July 1961 under the Chartered Accountants Ordinance, 1961. ICAP is the sole body and authority in Pakistan which has a mandate to regulate the accounting and auditing profession in the country. It adopts and develops the national auditing standards and develops accounting standards for the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). It represents accountants employed in public practice, business and industry, and the public sector. The institute is a member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), which is the global organization for the accountancy profession.

ICAP has more than 7,000 active members and more than 25,000 students. Other national accountancy bodies include Institute of cost and management accountants of Pakistan (ICMAP), PIPFA, etc. ICAP and ICMAP are full members of International federation of accountants and PIPFA is an associate member. Besides these national accountancy bodies, Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) &amp; Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) UK Bodies also has a strong presence in Pakistan.

=== Singapore ===
The Chartered Accountant of Singapore (CA (Singapore)) title is protected under the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) Act. The pathway to obtain the designation is owned by the SAC, a statutory body of the government. The Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) is a designated entity in the SAC Act and confers the CA (Singapore) designation on behalf of SAC. The Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification programme has three components: academic base, professional programme and 3 years of practical experience. ISCA and the SAC have worked to raise the profile and promote the Singapore CA Qualification for international recognition.

Applicants who are eligible for the Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification foundation programme should have either accredited degrees, other degrees, undergraduates and local polytechnic diplomas. Those with who are eligible for direct entry into the professional programme should have local accountancy degrees from Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University, Singapore University of Social Sciences, and Singapore Institute of Technology.

In 2013, holders of Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and CPA Australia have until 31 December 2016 and existing students have until 31 December 2018 to complete the ICPAS PAC and qualify for the &quot;Chartered Accountant of Singapore&quot; professional designation through the previous transitional arrangements.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, SAICA, the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, regulates the Chartered Accountant (South Africa) designation, CA (SA).

To qualify as a CA (SA), one requires a specialised bachelor&#x27;s degree in accounting, followed by a Certificate in the Theory of Accounting (CTA); depending on the university, this is offered as a postgraduate honours degree or as a postgraduate diploma. This formal education is followed by two external competency exams set by SAICA.

A separate registration is needed for Chartered Accountants wishing to act as auditors in public practice as a registered auditor (RA). The RA designation is conferred by IRBA (Independent Regulatory Board For Auditors, previously known as Public Accountants and Auditors Board [PAAB]) under the Auditing Profession Act (AP Act).

Candidates must complete three years of practical experience, working for a registered training office – the Training In Public Practice (TIPP) programme. Articled clerks who switch employers during this period are required to extend their training by six months. The Training Outside Public Practice (TOPP) programme has a financial management focus; TOPP trainees can thus become Chartered Accountants with a more limited knowledge and experience of auditing than those who undergo the TIPP programme, but with a more extensive financial management and business experience.

Chartered accountants who are not registered auditors may not act as or hold out to be auditors in public practice. However, the AP Act does not prohibit non-RAs from using the description &#x27;internal auditor&#x27; or &#x27;accountant&#x27;, or from auditing a not-for-profit club, institution or association if they receive no fee for such audit.

In South Africa the Companies Act was replaced, with effect in July 2010, to allow companies without a public interest to choose between an audit or an independent review. A review is not an attest function and can be performed by accountants who are members of bodies that are registered in terms of the Close Corporations Act of 1984, which include SAIBA, CIMA, SAICA, SAIPA and ACCA.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, the title of Chartered Accountant (CA Sri Lanka) can be used by only members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. These could be Associate Members (ACA) and Fellows (FCA). Chartered accountants holding practising certificates may also become Registered Auditors, who are able to perform statutory financial audits in accordance with the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007. Chartered Accountants can also register as company secretaries.

=== United Kingdom === 

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is an awarding body, conferring the postnominals ACA and FCA. 
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland confers the postnominals CA.

<text>Whiggism or Whiggery is a political philosophy that grew out of the Parliamentarian faction in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–1653) and was concretely formulated by Lord Shaftesbury during the Stuart Restoration. The Whigs advocated the supremacy of Parliament (as opposed to that of the king), government centralization, and coercive Anglicisation through the educational system. They also staunchly opposed granting freedom of religion, civil rights, or voting rights to anyone who worshipped outside of the Established Churches of the realm. Eventually, the Whigs grudgingly conceded strictly limited religious toleration for Protestant dissenters, while continuing the religious persecution and disenfranchisement of Roman Catholics and Scottish Episcopalians. They were particularly determined to prevent the ascension of a Catholic heir presumptive to the British throne, especially of James II or his legitimate male descendants and instead granted the throne to the Protestant House of Hanover in 1714. Whig ideology is associated with early conservative liberalism.

Beginning with the Titus Oates plot and Exclusion Crisis of 1679–1681, and the Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689, Whiggism dominated English and British politics until about 1760, after which the Whigs splintered into different political factions. In the same year, King George III was crowned and allowed the Tories back into the Government. Even so, some modern historians now call the period between 1714 and 1783 the, &quot;age of the Whig oligarchy&quot;.

Even after 1760, the Whigs still included about half of the newest noble families in England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, as well as most merchants, dissenters, and the middle classes. The opposing Tory position was held by the other great families, the non-juring and high church factions within the Church of England, many Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, most of the landed gentry and the traditional officer class of the British armed forces. Whigs especially opposed regime change efforts by adherents of Jacobitism, a movement of legitimist monarchists which promised freedom of religion and civil rights to all outside the Established Churches, devolution in the United Kingdom, linguistic rights for minority languages, and many other political reforms, and which shared a substantial overlap with and heavily influenced both early Toryism and what is now termed traditionalist conservatism. While in power, Whig politicians frequently denounced all their political opponents and critics as &quot;Jacobites&quot; or &quot;dupes of Jacobites&quot;.

The terms &quot;Old Whigs&quot; and Patriot Whigs were also used in Great Britain for those Whigs who formed a de facto coalition with the Tories and jointly opposed Robert Walpole as part of the Country Party. Whiggism originally referred to the Whigs of the British Isles, but the name of &quot;Old Whigs&quot; was largely adopted by the American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies of British North America. Before and during the American Revolution, American Whiggism, in a deeply ironic reversal, weaponized Whig political philosophy about the social contract enforced by the right of revolution against both the Whig-dominated government in Westminster and the Hanoverian monarchs. In the process, American Whiggism ultimately transitioned from monarchism into republicanism and Federalism, while also co-opting many traditionally Jacobite, Counter-Enlightenment, and early Tory positions. A similar but far more discreet co-opting was also taking place in the British Isles among many self-described Whigs, including Edmund Burke, Henry Grattan, William Wilberforce, Daniel O&#x27;Connell, and William Pitt the Younger. Even though they were often influenced in this regard by the writings of early Tories and other intellectual critics of the Whig party like Jonathan Swift, Lord Bolingbroke, and David Hume, these reformist Whigs, similarly to American Patriots, refused to use the word &quot;Tory&quot; as anything other than a term of abuse against those with more traditionalist Whig ideology, which ultimately changed the word&#x27;s meaning completely. Whig history, which was largely developed by Thomas Babington Macaulay to justify the party&#x27;s political ideology and past practices, remained the official history of the British Empire until serious challenges were raised to its claims by John Lingard, William Cobbett, Hilaire Belloc, G.K. Chesterton, Roger Scruton, Saunders Lewis, and John Lorne Campbell.

==Origins of the term==
Quickly following the adoption of &quot;Whig&quot; as the name of a political faction, the word &quot;Whiggism&quot; arose from the appendage of the suffix &quot;&quot;, creating a term for the Whigs&#x27; political ideology. It was already in use by the 1680s. In 1682, Edmund Hickeringill published his &quot;History of Whiggism&quot;. In 1702, writing satirically in the guise of a Tory, Daniel Defoe asserted: &quot;We can never enjoy a settled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation, till the Spirit of Whiggisme, Faction, and Schism is melted down like the Old-Money&quot;. The name probably originates from a shortening of Whiggamore referring to the Whiggamore Raid.

The word &quot;Whiggery&quot;, deriving from &quot;Whig&quot; and the suffix &quot;&quot;, has a similar meaning and has been used since the late 1600s.

==Origins==
The true origins of what became known as Whiggism lie in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the power struggle between the Parliament of England and King Charles I, which eventually turned into the English Civil Wars, but only after the example of the successful use of violent opposition to the king set by the Bishops&#x27; Wars, which were fought between the same king in his capacity as king of Scotland on the one side and the Parliament of Scotland and the Church of Scotland on the other. However, the immediate origins of the Whigs and Whiggism were in the Exclusion Bill crisis of 1678 to 1681, in which a country party battled a court party in an unsuccessful attempt to exclude James, Duke of York, from succeeding his brother Charles II as king of England, Scotland and Ireland. This crisis was prompted by Charles&#x27;s lack of a legitimate heir, by the discovery in 1673 that James was a Roman Catholic, and by the so-called Popish Plot of 1678.

While a major principle of Whiggism was opposition to popery, that was always much more than a mere religious preference in favour of Protestantism, although most Whigs did have such a preference. Sir Henry Capel outlined the principal motivation of the cry of &quot;no popery&quot; when he said in the House of Commons on 27 April 1679:

Although they were unsuccessful in preventing the accession of the Duke of York to the throne, the Whigs in alliance with William of Orange brought him down in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. By that event, a new supremacy of parliament was established, which itself was one of the principles of Whiggism, much as it had been the chief principle of the Roundheads in an earlier generation.

The great Whiggish achievement was the Bill of Rights of 1689. It made Parliament, not the Crown, supreme. It established free elections to the Commons (although they were mostly controlled by the local landlord), free speech in parliamentary debates, and asserted the prohibition of &quot;cruel or unusual punishment&quot;.

==Variations==

Lee Ward (2008) argues that the philosophical origins of Whiggism came in James Tyrrell&#x27;s &quot;Patriarcha Non Monarcha&quot; (1681), John Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; (1689) and Algernon Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; (1698). All three were united in opposing Sir Robert Filmer&#x27;s defence of divine right and absolute monarchy. Tyrrell propounded a moderate Whiggism which interpreted England&#x27;s balanced and mixed constitution &quot;as the product of a contextualized social compact blending elements of custom, history, and prescription with inherent natural law obligations&quot;. Sidney, on the other hand, emphasised the main themes of republicanism and based Whig ideology in the sovereignty of the people by proposing a constitutional reordering that would both elevate the authority of Parliament and democratise its forms. Sidney also emphasised classical republican notions of virtue. Ward says that Locke&#x27;s liberal Whiggism rested on a radically individualist theory of natural rights and limited government. Tyrrell&#x27;s moderate position came to dominate Whiggism and British constitutionalism as a whole from 1688 to the 1770s. The more radical ideas of Sidney and Locke, argues Ward, became marginalised in Britain, but emerged as a dominant strand in American republicanism. The issues raised by the Americans, starting with the Stamp Act crisis of 1765, ripped Whiggism apart in a battle of parliamentary sovereignty (Tyrrell) versus popular sovereignty (Sidney and Locke).

==Across the British Empire==
Whiggism took different forms in England and Scotland, even though from 1707 the two nations shared a single parliament. While English Whiggism had at its heart the power of parliament, creating for that purpose a constitutional monarchy and a permanently Protestant succession to the throne, Scottish Whigs gave a higher priority to using power for religious purposes, including maintaining the authority of the Church of Scotland, justifying the Protestant Reformation and emulating the Covenanters.

There were also Whigs in the North American colonies and while Whiggism there had much in common with that in Great Britain, it too had its own priorities. In the unfolding of the American Revolution such Whiggism became known as republicanism.

In India, Prashad (1966) argues that the profound influence of the ideas of Edmund Burke introduced Whiggism into the mainstream of Indian political thought. The Indians adopted the basic assumptions of Whiggism, especially the natural leadership of an elite, the political incapacity of the masses, the great partnership of the civil society and the best methods of achieving social progress, analysing the nature of society and the nation and depicting the character of the ideal state.

<doc id="1272594" wikidata="Q2129622" url="?curid=1272594" title="Ralph Grey, Baron Grey of Naunton">
<text>Ralph Francis Alnwick Grey, Baron Grey of Naunton, (15 April 1910 – 17 October 1999) was a New Zealand peer who served as the last Governor of Northern Ireland. He was created a Life Peer as Baron Grey of Naunton on 17 September 1968.

== Early life and education ==
Ralph Grey was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 15 April 1910 the only son of Francis Arthur Grey and Mary Wilks Spencer. 

He attended both Scots College and Wellington College before going up to University College, Auckland where he graduating as LLB. He then pursued postgraduate studies at Pembroke College, Cambridge and thereafter was called to the Bar. 

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Grey began his legal career as a clerk before practising as a barrister. He was appointed a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 1932. 

He joined the Colonial Administrative Service in 1936, as a probationer. 

=== Nigeria ===
The following year he was an administrative service cadet at Lagos in Nigeria. 

After World War II, he was promoted Assistant Financial Secretary in 1949. Two years later, he was an Administrative Officer First Class, quickly moving up to Deputy Secretary. 

He was Secretary to the Governor-General and General Council of Ministers in 1954, and Chief Secretary of the Federation the following year. Two years later he was raised up as Deputy Governor-General until just before independence in 1959.

A 1965 Order deemed the Governor of the Bahamas to also be the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Grey remained in both posts until 1968. 

=== Northern Ireland ===
That year Grey became Governor of Northern Ireland during the period of civil rights marches and increasing levels of street violence. The IRA announced a &#x27;bombing campaign&#x27; against British rule which reached new intensity in 1971–72. In the depths of an economic recession, local government was suspended; Northern Ireland was subjected to Direct Rule from Westminster, and Lord Grey of Naunton was recalled. During the same period he was President of the Scout Council of Northern Ireland. From 1970 Grey was appointed Chairman of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries of Northern Ireland, supporting industry as an Honorary Member of the Chambers of Commerce and Honorary President of the Lisburn Chamber of Commerce. From 1970 he was also an Honorary Bencher of the Inns of Court for Northern Ireland.

When the post was abolished in 1973, he was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO). At the same time, he was Knight Commander of Ards, then Bailiff of Egle from 1975, until appointment as Lord Prior of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (1988–91).

== Memberships ==
Grey was a Council member of Cheltenham Ladies College, where his daughter, Amanda, was educated. 

As well as regional commitments to Lloyds Bank, he served on its board in Bristol during 1970s. Lord Grey served as Chairman of the Central Council of the Royal Overseas League (1976–81). He was Chancellor of the New University of Ulster from 1980, and then from 1984 to 1993, he was Chancellor of the University of Ulster. 

In retirement, Grey was invited to be admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn. He was Grand President of the Royal Overseas League in 1993, Chairman of its General Council, but had been president since 1981. 

== Honours and awards ==
Grey was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1951. 

In 1955, he was appointed a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG) and, in 1959, a Knight Commander (KCMG) . 

He was first appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1956.

Grey received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland (the NUI) in 1985 and Honorary doctorates of Literature and Science by the University of Ulster.

== Personal life ==
In 1944 he married Esme Mae, daughter of Albert Victor Kerry Burcher, of Remuera, Auckland (and widow of Pilot Officer Kenneth Kirkaldie, REFVR). Lady Grey of Naunton, died on 22 March 1996. The couple had three children:

* The Hon. Jolyon Kenneth Alnwick Grey (b.1946)
* The Hon. Jeremy Francis Alnwick Grey (b.1948)
* The Hon. Amanda Mary Alnwick Grey (b.1950).

<doc id="1272595" wikidata="Q1612862" url="?curid=1272595" title="Eckington, Derbyshire">
<text>Eckington is a town and civil parish in North East Derbyshire, England. It is 7 miles (11 km) northeast of Chesterfield and 9 miles (14 km) southeast of Sheffield, on the border with South Yorkshire. It lies on the B6052 and B6056 roads close to the A6135 for Sheffield and Junction 30 of the M1. It had a 2001 population of 11,152, increasing to 11,855 (including the parish of Bramley, Renishaw, Marsh Lane and Troway) at the 2011 Census.

==History==
Ten Roman coins discovered in December 2008, near Eckington Cemetery may be evidence of a Roman settlement or road in the area. The oldest of the silver and copper coins is from the reign of the emperor Domitian (AD 81 to 96) while the others are from the reigns of Trajan (AD 98 to 117) and Hadrian (AD 117 to 138).

Eckington is recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Echintune&quot;, a manor given to Ralph Fitzhubert. Some parts of the parish church of St Peter and St Paul date to 1100.

George Sitwell, son of George and Mary was baptised in 1601 in Eckington. George&#x27;s father died whilst he was a child but as an adult he acquired the freehold of land in Eckington and exploited it by mining iron ore. In 1625, he built Renishaw Hall which is now owned by Sir Reresby Sitwell&#x27;s daughter, Alexandra and her family.

Sitwell exploited the minerals beneath his estate, chiefly iron and built a blast furnace at Plumbley a mile north west of Eckington in the 1630s with his mother&#x27;s second husband, Henry Wigfall. In 1652 Sitwell built a furnace at Foxbrooke, close to Renishaw, which became the core of the largest ironworks in Derbyshire. Sitwell made saws at Pleasley and in 1656, installed a rolling and slitting mill at Renishaw to supply the rod iron used by numerous local nailmakers.

During the Industrial Revolution coal and iron ore were mined and local streams, such as the Moss Brook, were harnessed to provide power for factories. The Sitwells built a large foundry and ironworks. Scythes, sickles and nails were made in the town for local use and for export. The Moss Brook was dammed to provide water power at eight sites including ChapelWheel, Carlton Wheel and Fields Wheel, to grind the blades. The remains of an old forge and drift mines exist in the valley. Eckington had a coal mine in the eastern part of the village, one of the very few in the country which is still operated.

==Governance==
Eckington falls under the jurisdiction of Derbyshire County Council, North East Derbyshire District Council and Eckington Parish Council.

==Geography==
Eckington covers an area of 2,089 acres. The geology is the coal measures containing coal and ironstone. The Chesterfield Canal and Midland Railway passed through the parish. The Moss Brook is a tributary of the River Rother.

==Schools==
The oldest school in Eckington is Camms CE Primary School. In 1702, Thomas Camm endowed a schoolhouse and a schoolmaster to teach 24 poor children in the parish. In 1832, Robert Harrison moved the school to a new building which cost £600, and it was moved again to its current location on Castle Hill in 1975.

Eckington School is a large comprehensive school, attracting pupils from the surrounding areas of Killamarsh, Renishaw, Beighton, Ridgeway and Mosborough. Despite being closer to several Sheffield residential areas the admissions policy favours pupils from Derbyshire feeder schools. Eckington Grammar School in Halfway became Derbyshire&#x27;s first comprehensive school in 1957, changing its name to the Westfield School, and since 1967 has been controlled by the city of Sheffield.
Eckington is also home to Eckington Junior School and Birk Hill Infants.

==Amenities==
Eckington has a swimming pool near the library, built in the 1970s as part of a town centre improvement. The town has a bus station (halt).

Eckington Woods to the north of the village forms part of the Moss Valley conservation area. They are also known as the Bluebell Wood because of the quantity of bluebells in the springtime.

==Transport==

Eckington is served by bus services to Sheffield, Chesterfield, Mansfield, Clowne and other surround settlements.

==Sport and Leisure==
===Cricket===
Eckington Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club with a history of cricket in the village dating back to 1885 on paddocks by the Renishaw Hall. The club ground is located on Staveley Lane and they field 3 Senior XI teams in the Derbyshire County Cricket League, two Senior XI teams in the Mansfield &amp; District Cricket League, an indoor Woman&#x27;s hardball team in the South Yorkshire Women &amp; Girls Cricket League and they run a Junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Ben Jessop Sheffield and District Junior League.

<text>Andrea DeShong (born March 16, 1962) is a former United States female boxer who is best remembered for defeating Christy Martin in Martin&#x27;s fourth professional bout.

== Professional career ==

DeShong made her professional debut on March 11, 1989, when she beat Angel Horton by a first round knockout in Wheeling, West Virginia. After one more win, she faced the experienced Jamie Whitcomb, and also won this bout by a first-round knockout.

=== First fights with Martin ===

After winning two more fights, one by a second-round knockout, she and Martin met on November 4, at Bristol, Tennessee. DeShong inflicted Martin&#x27;s first career defeat, winning by a five-round decision. Right after defeating Martin, she had a second victory against Whitcomb, who lasted five full rounds this time, before losing a unanimous decision to DeShong.

On April 21, 1990, she and Martin fought for the second time, and Martin avenged her defeat, while at the same time handing DeShong her own first loss as a professional, by a five-round decision, also at Bristol.

=== Rematch ===

It remains difficult for women boxers to find matches, and it was more difficult prior to the mid-&#x27;90s. DeShong ended up having a six-year layoff after the rematch with Martin. When she returned to boxing, she was somewhat known to fans, as Martin had become the WBC women&#x27;s World Welterweight Champion, and DeShong remained the only boxer to defeat her as a professional. It helped DeShong regain prominence that Martin had become a symbol of women&#x27;s boxing, having appeared in the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine and becoming a popular fighter by appearing on Showtime Network boxing undercards as well as pay-per-view boxing shows.

== Return ==

DeShong returned April 27, 1996, losing a four-round decision to Christine Butts. After two knockout wins against Jackie Rogers and one more win, she faced Kathy Collins, losing by a six-round unanimous decision at New York, New York.

After another win, she faced Isra Girgrah, on November 10, at Washington, D.C. The two fought to a six-round draw (tie).

After two more wins, she received her first world title try, on March 2, 1997, being knocked out by Jane Couch in seven rounds at New Orleans, Louisiana, for the WIBF&#x27;s World Jr. Welterweight title.

Despite that setback, her next fight was a major event. As part of the undercard of the rematch between Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson (&quot;The Bite Fight&quot;), which also featured former world champions Julio César Chávez and Miguel Ángel González, she and Martin met for a third time. The fight was preceded by much fan hype, and both boxers were involved in &quot;trash talking&quot; on the days leading to the match. Martin defeated DeShong by a seventh-round knockout on June 28.

DeShong lost to Lucia Rijker in her next fight, September 13, by a knockout in round three.

Despite losing three fights in a row, she found herself challenging Kathy Collins for the world title in her next fight. DeShong failed for the second time to win the world title, also losing for the fourth time in a row, when Collins handed her a ten-round unanimous decision loss on January 10, 1998, for the IWBF World Jr. Welterweight title.

After two more losses in a row, to Sumya Anani and Mitzi Jeter, she retired from boxing.

Some fans and critics have observed that, after she gave up boxing for the first time, she should not have returned. When she did return, in 1996, she was 34 years old, an age when most boxers and athletes in general are considered to be &quot;past their prime&quot;.

Andrea DeShong had 13 wins, 9 losses and 1 draw in 24 bouts, with 8 knockout wins.

<text>The University of Mary (UMary or simply Mary) is a private, Benedictine university near Bismarck, North Dakota that has 3,852 students. It was established in 1959 as Mary College.

The university is the largest degree-granting institution in western North Dakota. It has study-abroad campuses in Rome and Arequipa, Peru, and also operates academic programs at satellite locations in North Dakota (Fargo, downtown Bismarck, Williston, Watford City, Grand Forks), Minnesota, Montana, Kansas, and Arizona.

==History==

The University of Mary has its origins in a boarding school founded in Bismarck, Dakota Territory, in 1878 by Benedictine sisters. In 1885, the sisters founded St. Alexius Hospital, adding a College of Nursing in 1915. In 1944, the sisters formed the Convent of the Annunciation, independent of the motherhouse in St. Joseph, Minnesota. The convent was renamed Annunciation Priory in 1947.

===First buildings===
In the early 1950s, the sisters requested that celebrated Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer design a new priory building. At the time, Breuer was finishing the new abbey and several university buildings at Saint John&#x27;s Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota. In 1955, he accepted the commission only after visiting the site, meeting the sisters, and being &quot;overwhelmed by the power and presence of the landscape setting and the mission.&quot; Breuer&#x27;s designs used native granite prairie stone, complex concrete shapes, and a juxtaposition of light and shadow. The first buildings were a convent, dining hall, and classrooms. The school was officially founded as a women&#x27;s college in 1959 as Mary College. Our Lady of the Annunciation Chapel was consecrated in 1963 in the second phase of construction. As the school grew, it endeavored to preserve the spirit of Breuer&#x27;s modernist prairie architecture while implementing new programs and new buildings by lesser-known architects.

=== Coeducation and university status ===
Mary College rapidly expanded and became fully co-educational in the 1960s. It achieved university status—becoming the University of Mary—in 1986. The University of Mary is North Dakota&#x27;s only private Catholic university. It has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1969. Since its incorporation in 1959, the university&#x27;s enrollment has grown from 69 to more than 3,800. Its undergraduate programs have grown from nursing and education to 65+ degrees, ranging from accounting to Catholic studies.

In 1986, the university began offering master&#x27;s degrees in nursing, management, and education. It has added master&#x27;s programs in business administration, counseling, occupational therapy, physical therapy, public administration, project management, clinical exercise physiology, kinesiology, speech-language pathology, music, Catholic studies, and bioethics. Doctorates are offered in education, nursing, business, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.

===2000 and later===
In 2001, the University of Mary unveiled its vision as &quot;America&#x27;s Leadership University.&quot; In 2005, the master&#x27;s degree in physical therapy was replaced by a Doctor of Physical Therapy—the university&#x27;s first doctorate. The first 26 candidates in this program received their entry-level clinical doctorates in 2006. Since then, doctorates have been added in education, nursing, and occupational therapy.
The university has expanded options to make education accessible to working adults and support lifelong learning in the region and beyond. University of Mary Online offers accelerated undergraduate and graduate programs for the adult learner. The university also has 14 satellite campuses in the Upper Midwest and beyond, including the Butler Center in downtown Bismarck, Fargo Center in Fargo, North Dakota, and Billings Center in Billings, Montana. Since 2005, the University of Mary has offered bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programs online.

In 2006, UMary initiated the Gary Tharaldson School of Business. Named for Gary Tharaldson, a North Dakota hospitality entrepreneur and industry innovator, the school was designed to bridge the gap between academia and the business world. The flagship facility that houses the Gary Tharaldson School opened in 2008.

In December 2008, the university announced that a 33-year-old Catholic priest, Father James Patrick Shea, had been named as its new president. At the time and for nearly a decade afterward, he was the nation&#x27;s youngest college or university president.

From the fall of 2009 to the spring of 2010, the University of Mary searched for a facility as the base for its Rome, Italy program. It found one a ten-minute bus ride from the city center, on the Via del Casaletto. The first students to study in this Rome program traveled from the U.S. in the fall of 2010. 
The Catholic Studies Program, an initiative of Shea, also launched in the fall of 2010. On October 19, 2010, the program was named in honor of Bishop Paul Albert Zipfel, sixth bishop of the Diocese of Bismarck. It is an interdisciplinary program designed to explore the Catholic Church&#x27;s contributions to and influence on human thought and culture. The program invites students of any faith who wish to deepen their knowledge of Catholicism&#x27;s history and living tradition.

In 2019, the University of Mary started a Satellite program whereby ASU students can take University of Mary Classes at the Old Main in Tempe, Arizona. The classes count as humanities credits for ASU classes. This program was the result of collaboration between Dr Crow, president of ASU, and Monsignor Shea.

The University of Mary has 1,130 employees, with a full-time teaching faculty of more than 300. Annual revenue in 2021 was $81.9 million.

<text>Eckington is a small village near to the southern border of the English county of Worcestershire, according to the 2001 census it had a population of 1,202.

The River Avon passes the village to the North and West and these areas are prone to flooding. It is situated at the north-west side of Bredon Hill, an outcrop of the Cotswolds. The nearest towns to Eckington and also situated along the River Avon are Pershore which is north and Evesham north east. The historic town of Tewkesbury is situated south west on the River Severn which river also runs through the nearest city of Worcester ( from Eckington).

Eckington is renowned for Eckington Bridge, which is the subject of a poem by Arthur Quiller-Couch, its village cross and its Norman-period church. It has a school, the Eckington Church of England First School, a recreation centre and scout hut with surrounding recreation grounds, home to the village&#x27;s football and cricket teams, and a village hall. In 2023, Community Fields were opened, with paths for walking, grassed and wild flower areas, and plans for a memorial garden near to the cemetery.

Eckington has a village shop and 2 hairdressers. It currently has two pubs The Bell and The Anchor, both offering food and guest accommodation; a third pub, The Crown, closed in the early 1990s.

Eckington railway station was located on the Bristol to Birmingham Line main railway line. It closed in January 1965.

One of the Pilgrim Fathers, George Soule, is believed to have come from the village.

== History ==
The Grade II listed village cross now stands in a grass triangle at the junction of Church Street and Drakes Bridge Road 52°4&#x27;18.83&quot;N+2°6&#x27;56.28&quot;W . It was moved to there when restored in 1897, and given a Maltese Cross. The base and shaft are medieval with Victorian inscriptions on North &amp; South faces of the shaft, the former barely visible. The Inscription reads:

DOMINE•SALVAM•FAC•REGINAM•MDCCCXCVII (God Save the Queen 1897).

<doc id="1272608" wikidata="Q1398023" url="?curid=1272608" title="Eihwaz">
<text>Eiwaz or Eihaz is the reconstructed Proto-Germanic name of the rune , coming from a word for &quot;yew&quot;. Two variants of the word are reconstructed for Proto-Germanic, &quot;*īhaz&quot; (&quot;*ē2haz&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European &#x27;), continued in Old English as (also ), and &quot;*īwaz&quot; (&quot;*ē2waz&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European&#x27;), continued in Old English as &quot;īw&quot; (whence English &#x27;). The latter is possibly an early loan from the Celtic, compare Gaulish &quot;ivos&quot;, Breton &quot;ivin&quot;, Welsh &quot;ywen&quot;, Old Irish &quot;[[Iodhadh|ēo]]&quot;. The common spelling of the rune&#x27;s name, &quot;Eihwaz&quot;, combines the two variants; strictly based on the Old English evidence, a spelling &quot;Eihaz&quot; would be more proper.

Following the convention of Wolfgang Krause, the rune&#x27;s standard transliteration today is &quot;ï&quot;, though this designation is somewhat arbitrary as the rune&#x27;s purpose and origin are still not well understood. Elmer Antonsen and Leo Connolly theorized that the rune originally stood for a Proto-Germanic vowel lost by the time of the earliest known runic inscriptions, though they put forth different vowels (Antonsen put forth while Connolly put forth ). Ottar Grønvik proposed . Tineke Looijenga postulates the rune was originally a bindrune of ᛁ and ᛃ, having the sound value of or . Bengt Odenstedt suggests it may have been adapted from the classical Latin alphabet&#x27;s &quot;Z&quot;, or &quot;Y&quot;.

The rune survives in the Anglo-Saxon futhorc as &quot;Ēoh&quot; or &quot;Īh&quot; &quot;yew&quot; (note that ᛖ &quot;eoh&quot; &quot;horse&quot; has a short diphthong). In futhorc inscriptions Ēoh appears as both a vowel around , and as a consonant around and . As a vowel, Ēoh shows up in &quot;jïslheard&quot; (ᛡᛇᛋᛚᚻᛠᚱᛞ) on the Dover Stone. As a consonant, Ēoh shows up in &quot;almeïttig&quot; (ᚪᛚᛗᛖᛇᛏᛏᛁᚷ) on the Ruthwell Cross.

The Anglo-Saxon rune poem reads:
: 

: The yew is a tree with rough bark,
: hard and fast in the earth, supported by its roots,
: a guardian of flame and a joy on native land.

<text>In ice hockey, an official is a person who has some responsibility for enforcing the rules and maintaining the order of the game. There are two categories of officials, on-ice officials, who are the referees and linesmen that enforce the rules during gameplay, and off-ice officials, who have an administrative role rather than an enforcement role.

== On-ice officials ==

As the name implies, on-ice officials do their job on the hockey rink. They are traditionally clad in a black hockey helmet, black trousers, and a black-and-white vertically striped shirt. They wear standard hockey skates and carry a finger whistle, which they use to stop play. They communicate with players, coaches, and off-ice officials, both verbally and via hand signals. Starting in 1955 with the introduction of the black-and-white jersey, NHL on-ice officials wore numbers on their back for identification. In 1977, NHL officials removed the number and had only their surnames on the back of their jerseys for identification, normally in a single row across the shoulders. (Some officials with long names would have their name in two rows, the most notable example being Andy Van Hellemond.) However, in 1994, NHL officials returned to wearing solely numbers on their shirts, a procedure adopted by other sports leagues.

In the early days of hockey when the NHL was formed (1917), the referees would carry a bell, not a whistle, to stop the game in progress. 

Later, NHL referees wore cream-colored sweaters over a shirt and tie, from the 1930s to the early 1950s. They then briefly wore orange sweaters with half-zip fronts (and without neckties), until the black-and-white-striped jersey was introduced in 1955.

=== Referees ===
A &quot;referee&quot; is responsible for the general supervision of the game and can be identified by the orange armbands on his or her arms. Ice hockey is a fast-paced sport with high-velocity shots of a puck that is only a few inches in diameter; therefore referees aim to position themselves so they have specific unobstructed views of plays in order to make crucial judgment calls as accurately as possible.

Under most officiating systems, the referee is the only official with the authority to assess penalties for violations of the rules. When a penalty is being assessed the referee will stand at center ice and announce the penalty to the entire arena. However, the linesmen can report a variety of penalties, such as &quot;too many men on the ice&quot; and major penalties, to the referee, who may then assess the penalty. The referee also conducts the opening face-off in each period and face-offs that follow after a goal is scored, which are done at the center ice face-off dot. If a goal is challenged, the referee or referees are the ones who review the play.

=== Linesmen ===
&quot;Linesmen&quot; or &quot;linespersons&quot; are primarily responsible for watching for violations involving the centre line and the blue line. Such infractions include icing and offside, after which the linesmen conduct faceoffs. They are also expected to break up scuffles, fistfights and other altercations that occur during the game. In some leagues, the rules allow linesmen to call some penalties (such as &quot;Too many men on the ice&quot;), while others only allow them to report the infraction to the referee.

==== Assistant referees ====
In some leagues, the linesmen are given the title of the assistant referee. When given this title, they are given more responsibility to stop play and to call penalties that the referee may not see. The NCAA previously used this designation prior to altering its officiating systems in 2006.

=== On-ice officiating systems ===
* The &quot;three-official system&quot; uses one referee and two linesmen. The NHL previously used this system until changing to the four-official system in the late 1990s. The highest level for this system is the ECHL, which does official development for the NHL.

* The &quot;four-official system&quot; adds a second referee for a total of two referees and two linesmen. In this system, each referee works either the lead/front or the trail/back position. The lead position is normally in the corner of the end zone, while the trail position is in the neutral zone, diagonally opposite the lead referee. As the game transitions from one end of the ice to the other, the lead becomes the trail and vice versa. The four-official system is used in the NHL, AHL, and at other high levels, such as major junior, junior &#x27;A&#x27;, and top European leagues. In 2007-2008, college hockey used the system in some games on a trial basis. The IIHF first implemented this system for men&#x27;s games at the 2008 IIHF World Championship and for women&#x27;s games at the 2014–15 IIHF European Women&#x27;s Champions Cup; the four-man officiating system has subsequently been the standard in IIHF competition. The NCAA voted in July 2012 to make the four-official system mandatory for men&#x27;s games starting in the 2013-14 season.
* In the &quot;two-official system&quot;, each official acts as both referee and linesman. Each official has the responsibility to call both penalties and line violations. In this system, neither official wears red or orange armbands or both will wear one armband each. This is used at lower levels of youth hockey and in most adult recreational leagues.
* In the &quot;2-1 system&quot; (the least common of the on-ice official systems), also called the &quot;modified three-man&quot;, there are two referees and one linesman. There are a variety of ways to divide the responsibilities between the referees and linesmen. Typically, the back referee is responsible for making the initial call at the blue line when the puck first enters the zone, and after that the linesman takes over. 
* The &quot;1-1 system&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Texas two-man&quot;) uses one referee and one linesman. This is usually seen in adult recreational leagues (sometimes called &quot;beer league&quot; - C, D and I divisions) as a cost-saving measure; the pace of play at this level is typically slow enough for the two officials to cover events between them. This can also be an informal system used &quot;ad hoc&quot; when one of the officials does not show up for a game scheduled to use the three-official system, or when an official is hurt during a game. The referee in this system also has the duties of a linesman.
* Beginner-level adult leagues sometimes will only use a single on-ice official who is responsible for calling line violations and penalties. The official will not usually wear orange or red armbands in this system.

== Off-ice officials ==
&quot;Off-ice officials&quot;, formerly referred to as &#x27;Minor Officials&#x27; with the exception of the video goal judge in professional leagues, do not have any direct impact on the outcome of the game. They serve primarily in administrative and advisory roles.

=== Goal judge ===
The &quot;goal judge&quot; determines whether a player has scored a goal by watching to see if the puck has crossed the goal line completely. They act only in an advisory role; the referee has the sole authority to award goals and thus can override the opinion of the goal judge.

One goal judge is positioned outside the rink directly behind each goal net. For arenas so equipped, the goal judge turns on a red light behind the goal to signal a score. The red goal light and the adjacent green light are connected to the arena game clock. When the clock operator stops the clock, or the time remaining expires, the red light is not able to be activated. In the NHL, the green light is activated only when the game clock reads 00.0 seconds: in lower levels, the green light may be linked to the scoreboard&#x27;s siren or turn on whenever the time is stopped.

In games governed by the IIHF, goal judges wear the same black-and-white striped shirts as on-ice officials. This is not the case for goal judges in North America for games under different hockey codes: their goal judges are usually dressed in apparel bearing a league or hockey association logo, such as sport coats or athletic jackets.

In the mid-2000s, the National Hockey League relocated goal judges to higher locations (most commonly the press box, a catwalk or the lower section of the upper deck) with wireless signals. The idea was to allow teams to sell the prime seats, but also to give officials a better view of the action as to be able to reject goals if violations (illegally kicked in, a player in the crease, offside) took place. However, with the expansion of video replay and the addition of a second referee on the ice, the role of the goal judge became relegated to activating the goal lights. The league ceased using goal judges after the 2018–2019 season. The video goal judge now activates the goal lights from the video replay booth.

Goal judges were first used around 1877 in Montreal, and were initially called umpires.

=== Video goal judge ===

The video goal judge reviews replays of disputed goals. As the referee does not have access to television monitors, the video goal judge&#x27;s decision on disputed goals is taken as final. In the NHL, goals may only be reviewed in the following situations: puck crossing the goal line completely and before time expired, puck in the net prior to goal frame being dislodged, puck being directed into the net by hand or foot, the puck deflected into the net off an official, and the puck deflected into the goal by a high stick (stick above the goal) by an attacking player. All NHL goals are subject to review, and although most arenas have a video goal judge, officials from the NHL Hockey Operations Department, located in the Situation Room (also known as the &quot;War Room&quot;) at the NHL office in Toronto, will often make the final decision. Arena video goal judges are used in case the communication link with Toronto is not working, and also for other situations such as timing or proper statistic attribution.

=== Official scorer ===
The &quot;official scorer&quot; keeps the official record of the game. They are responsible for obtaining a list of eligible players from both teams prior to the start of the game. They award points for goals and assists, and their decision in this regard is final. The official scorer typically sits in an elevated position away from the edge of the rink.

=== Penalty timekeeper ===
The &quot;penalty timekeeper&quot; records the penalties imposed by the referee. He is responsible for ensuring that the correct penalty times are posted on the score clock and that players leave the penalty box at the appropriate times.

=== Game timekeeper ===
The &quot;game timekeeper&quot; is responsible for stopping and starting the game clock.

=== Statistician ===
The &quot;statistician&quot; records all required data concerning individual and team performances.

<doc id="1272619" wikidata="Q5332909" url="?curid=1272619" title="Eckington (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Eckington is a neighborhood in Northeast Washington, D.C., located south of the Prospect Hill and Glenwood Cemeteries. Eckington is less than southeast of Howard University and exactly one mile north of the United States Capitol. Eckington is also the home of the District of Columbia office of Sirius XM Radio.

Eckington is bordered by:
*Rhode Island Avenue and the Edgewood neighborhood to the north
*North Capitol Street and the Bloomingdale neighborhood to the west
*Florida Avenue and the Truxton Circle and NoMa neighborhoods to the south and 
*The Metro rail Red Line and the Metro&#x27;s Brentwood Yard to the east

The closest metro stations serving Eckington are NoMa–Gallaudet U Station, located south of Eckington, and Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood Station, located northeast of Eckington.

==History==
The land which became Eckington was the country home of Joseph Gales Jr., owner of the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot; and mayor of Washington from 1827 to 1830. Gales bought the Northeast tract in 1815, and in 1830 erected a two-story house on the hilltop, about where Third and U Streets intersect today. Gales named his estate Eckington after the village in Derbyshire, England in which he was born.

During the American Civil War, the house was used as a hospital for the 7th Regiment of New York. After the war, Eckington, commonly known as Gales Woods, was a popular picnic ground.

In 1887, Eckington was bought by George Truesdell and his wife Frances, who subdivided the property, improved it substantially for habitation, sold lots, and built several houses. Truesdell undertook extensive grading operations to level the landscape of his Eckington subdivision. He laid down water and sewer pipes, paved streets in asphalt and concrete, and erected a stand pipe near the old Gales house. A steam pump brought water to the stand pipe, which distributed water throughout the new neighborhood. Truesdell erected five &quot;pretty cottages&quot; which, according to an 1888 newspaper account, were &quot;all fitted up as city houses,&quot; with steam heat and hot and cold running water. Eckington was wired for electricity in 1889, two years before electricity was installed in the White House. In three years, Truesdell spent $500,000 improving the subdivision.

The contractor for Truesdell&#x27;s houses was John H. Lane, who moved from Dupont Circle into one of those houses at 1725 Third Street. From 1889 to 1897, Lane developed nearly 20 properties in Eckington. None of Truesdell&#x27;s original five houses exists today, although several detached houses from the late 19th century, by Lane and others, dot the streets of Eckington. The first three decades of the 20th century brought a boom in rowhouse construction to Eckington as it did in many parts of the District of Columbia.

Truesdell placed restrictive covenants in the deeds of Eckington&#x27;s residential properties that required that each house cost at least $2,000 and be set back from the building line. There was to be no manufacturing. The Union Army veteran did not place racial restrictions in the deeds, although as late as 1930, there were no African American families living in Eckington.

The Eckington and Soldiers&#x27; Home Railway began service on October 17, 1888. It was Washington&#x27;s first electric railway and followed by just a few months the first practical electric railway in Richmond, Virginia. The line ran from Seventh Street and New York Avenue NW to Fourth and T Streets NE in Eckington, then was extended in 1889, up Fourth Street to Michigan Avenue and The Catholic University of America.

Col. Truesdell&#x27;s subdivision straddled the narrow tracks of the Metropolitan Branch of the B&amp;O Railroad. The Met Branch was a line that brought commuters into the city from Maryland beginning in 1873. In 1888, the B&amp;O bought just north of Florida Avenue and built a passenger station. Passengers were to disembark and ride the new electric line into the city. A few years later, the B&amp;O built a huge freight depot next to the passenger station. This freight center spurred the development of manufacturing and warehousing along the west side of the tracks from Florida Avenue north to Rhode Island Avenue, Truesdell&#x27;s covenants notwithstanding. The National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) was at 4th and S Streets and Judd and Detweiler printers was at Florida Avenue and Eckington Place. There were as many as 20 warehouses, mostly for groceries and home and building supplies. When the tracks were greatly expanded after the construction of Union Station, the east side of Eckington disappeared under them, including two of Truesdell&#x27;s original houses.

In 1907, a bridge at 4th and T St. NE was built over the tracks to connect Eckington with the Brentwood neighborhood to the east. It was designed to carry motor traffic and pedestrians. A trolley connection at the west end of the bridge stopped in 1962, and the bridge was demolished in the late 1960s.

Although the streetcar had been a community center for both Eckington and Bloomingdale, the adjacent neighborhood to the west, after the streetcar line was removed in the 1950s North Capitol Street was dug into a trench to facilitate high-speed, high-volume traffic. The entrenched highway created a stark separation between Eckington from Bloomingdale. North Capitol Street remains noisy and difficult to cross; this, along with the railroad tracks on its east, gives Eckington its relatively isolated quality.

<text>María Teresa Fernández de la Vega Sanz (born 15 June 1949) is a Spanish politician and magistrate of the Socialist Party. During her political career, she served as first deputy prime minister, minister of the Presidency and government spokesperson under prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero from 2004 to 2010 and as president of the Council of State from 2018 to 2022, being the first first female deputy prime minister and the first female president of the advisory council.

==Early life and career==
Fernández de la Vega is the daughter of Wenceslao Fernández de la Vega Lombán who was a public servant during Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, a delegate of the ministry of employment headed at that time by Fermín Sanz Orrio (1957–1962). She was born in Valencia in 1949. She earned a degree in law from the Complutense University of Madrid in the early 1970s. In 1974 she entered Spain&#x27;s &quot;Cuerpo de Secretarios Jurídicos Laborales&quot;, a specialised body of the civil service.

==Political career==
Fernández de la Vega started her political career in the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, remaining a member of it until 1979. From 1982 until 1985, she was the director of the advisory cabinet of the minister of justice, and in 1985 she was appointed general director of services at the ministry of justice. In 1986 she became a member of the legal cooperation committee of the Council of Europe. In 1990, she was chosen as a spokesperson of the general council of judicial power by the Senate (1994–1996). On 13 May 1994, the then Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch appointed her as the 1st Secretary of State for Justice.

Fernández de la Vega was elected a member of the Spanish Congress for Jaén for the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party candidacy for the 1996–2000 term, being re-elected in the elections of 2000 for Segovia. During this term she became general secretary of the Socialist parliamentary group.

In the Spanish general election of 2004 she became a member of the parliament for Madrid, and on 18 April of that year she was appointed first vice president and minister of Presidency, remaining the incumbent of each.

Fernández de la Vega was the first woman to take on the functions of the prime minister in the history of Spanish democracy, when, on 24 April 2004, during the first official visit abroad of Spain&#x27;s Prime Minister, Zapatero, she presided over the Council of Ministers.

In March 2006, the first vice president went on an African tour with the state secretary for cooperation, Leire Pajín, visiting Kenya and Mozambique, in whose capital, Maputo, they celebrated International Women&#x27;s Day and closed the forum &quot;Spain-Africa: Women for a better world&quot;.

For the 2008 elections, Fernández de la Vega headed the list for the PSOE in Valencia. She left all the political offices in October 2010.

== President of the Council of State ==
After leaving the first political line, on 3 July 2018, prime minister Pedro Sánchez chose her to chair over the Council of State, the supreme consultative council of the Spanish government. She assumed the office on 5 July 2018, becoming the first woman to chair the council.

==Other activities==
* Judges for Democracy (Jueces para la Democracia), Member
* Graduate School for Global and International Studies, University of Salamanca, Member of the Advisory Board

<text>Robin Hood Engineering Ltd was a British kit car manufacturer based in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire. The factory covered and was on a one and a half acre site.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1980 in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire by Richard Stewart, and started by making Ferrari Daytona replicas based on the Rover SD1 and later the Jaguar XJ12. The Lotus Super Seven was copied after the production by Lotus ended. it was the series 3 that was copied, not the series 4 that Caterham cars had bought the rights to 

In 1989, a Triumph TR7 based Robin Hood was introduced with the affordable price tag of £995 + VAT. Motoring enthusiasts showed their support and several kits were sold. Development of the new product was continual and feedback from customers showed that a range of engine sizes were needed, so that more people could afford to run such a vehicle. The Triumph Dolomite superseded the TR7 as donor vehicle, a popular choice with engines ranging from 1100 cc to 2000 cc. Ford Cortina, and then the Ford Sierra.

High Court action from Caterham Cars almost stopped production, however legal advice gave a remedy to the problem. Robin Hood Engineering were careful not to deviate from the strict guidelines set down as a result of the action. An agreement was reached and it was agreed that the word SEVEN, OR GREEN CARS WITH A YELLOW NOSE CONE be used in RHE&#x27;s promotions

The Monocoque style chassis (a structure formed from sheet steel without tubes) was manufactured using the Triumph Dolomite, Ford Cortina and Ford Sierra as donor vehicle. Although the donor vehicles and basic designs may have altered throughout the years, the main policy to supply value for money kits remained. Whilst other manufacturers had customers trawling scrap yards for an assortment of components to build cars, the Robin Hood policy of &quot;One kit + one donor vehicle = car on the road&quot; was a valuable selling point.

During 1996 and 1997 sales of Robin Hoods peaked at over 500 kits per year, and larger premises at Mansfield Woodhouse Notts, and extensive new CNC machinery were purchased to maintain production. In 1998, with the introduction of the Single Vehicle Approval test, the public were not so keen to embark on a build, preferring to wait and see what was going to happen. Implementation dates were put off several times by the Government and the whole of the kit car industry suffered.
 Also a war between magazine publishers Peter Filby (WHICH KIT) and Dennis Tanner,(kit CAR), broke out and split the whole industry in to two, demoralising everybody, fortunately, as the magazines faded away, the internet stepped in, and kept the kit car industry alive a little longer, before The Government&#x27;s SVA test made the final step of getting your kit-car on the road very difficult.

This generally upsetting period enabled Richard Stewart to look carefully at Robin Hood Engineering&#x27;s operations, an now in his fifties, ideally would have liked to have sold the business to allow him to concentrate on other interests. But with no offers forthcoming, the licence to manufacture Monocoque chassis about to expire and the recent heavy investment in new CNC machinery, the only option was to carry on with a brand new model.

With the assistance of a team of expert chassis designers, a revolutionary new chassis was conceived. The new style chassis was affectionately called the &#x27;tubey&#x27; by staff and the &#x27;Project 2B&#x27; (a reference to the affectionate nickname) was adopted as the kit name. Between the bulk collection dates of 21 August and 11 December 1999, exactly 205 kits were collected. Bulk collections have always been successful at Robin Hood Engineering, the record being one collection day in 1997 totalling 125 comprehensive kits.

In 2006 Richard Stewart sold the assets of `Robin Hood Sports Cars&#x27; which were bought by Great British Sports Cars Ltd.

== The Zero ==

The most recent model by Great British Sports Cars is called &#x27;The Zero&#x27; The Zero was designed to be small, lightweight, and purposeful car, suited to road and track use. It is available in 9 colours, and compatible with a range of engines. It is available as a kit, partially assembled, or fully built.

<text>Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS) was a connectionless service used to connect LANs, MANs and WANs to exchange data, in early 1990s. In Europe, the service was known as Connectionless Broadband Data Service (CBDS).

SMDS was specified by Bellcore, and was based on the IEEE 802.6 metropolitan area network (MAN) standard, as implemented by Bellcore, and used cell relay transport, Distributed Queue Dual Bus layer-2 switching arbitrator, and standard SONET or G.703 as access interfaces.

It is a switching service that provides data transmission in the range between 1.544 Mbit/s (T1 or DS1) to 45 Mbit/s (T3 or DS3). SMDS was developed by Bellcore as an interim service until Asynchronous Transfer Mode matured. SMDS was notable for its initial introduction of the 53-byte cell and cell switching approaches, as well as the method of inserting 53-byte cells onto G.703 and SONET. In the mid-1990s, SMDS was replaced, largely by Frame Relay.
